","This second installment of the Transformers series wasn't as fantastic as the first one but it was still pretty good. Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox, and the rest of the cast did a great job in this movie. The plot to the movie was pretty good and the action scenes were pretty cool. A lot of people didn't like this movie, but I did and I would recommend it."
"brendan5","6","506","827","26 June 2009"," Great effects - story lacking
","As expected, the effects were spectacular. The fight scenes were extravagant and fast-paced.<br/><br/>The story though, couldn't keep pace. They kept stopping for a romance that was never developed (and no one really cared). The real thing that brought this movie down though was the constant stooping to this immature level. The had to have said @ss and balls 10 times (and that's a low estimate). Not only this, but those two twin autobots were introduced who were supposed to be ""hip"" maybe? They just turned out to be extremely annoying and to bring down the level of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>As a fan of the original cartoon series, I have to say I was really disappointed they stooped the level of immature @ss-balls humor and creating new characters with low IQ's. They could have done better. The action though, was amazing and I am still glad I paid to see it on the big screen."

","Seeker is back. I didnt think it was going to happen. Because if you think about it, how could a guy who starts fires in his own room survive. Most of the time Seeker is driving a cesna plane over the ocean at night thinking about someone thats somewhere else (cant be changed). B..U....T when he's not doing that he's either sitting in his room with a fire already going or trying to start a fire (in the old way). Friction and finess."

"zardoz-13","7","65","100","2 July 2009"," Too Much Comic Relief Undercuts An Above-Average Sci-Fi Saga
","Too much comic relief undermines the dramatic impact of director Michael Bay's visually impressive sequel ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" If you skipped the original live-action ""Transformers,"" you may not understand the stakes in the sequel or the situation. The original concluded with the treacherous Decepticon jet Transformer streaking off into the sky, guaranteeing the survival of the villains. Original ""Transformer"" scenarists Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are joined on this installment by ""Reindeer Games"" writer Ehren Kruger and they bring back the evil Decepticons for a rematch with the virtuous Autobots. <br/><br/>Clocking in at an hour and 49 minutes, Bay's epic length sequel features machine-like entities shape-shifting from various vehicles into gigantic robots with deadly appendages that discharge explosive broadsides whenever they unleash their titanic fury. The problem is Bay neglects the narrative for these massive transformations. When the Hasbro creations aren't changing from innocent machines into destructive robots, Bay and his scribes are slinging visual and verbal jokes as fast as you can blink. In other words, ""Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen"" lacks suspense until the last quarter hour when the flesh & blood performers inject some emotional gravity into this superficial smackdown between good and evil alien robots.<br/><br/>""Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen"" opens with a prologue in 17,000 B.C. when mankind initially runs afoul of the alien robots, before Bay jumps ahead to the 21st century when mankind and the Autobots have formed an alliance. U.S. Army Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel of ""Turistas"") and Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson of ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), command an elite squad codenamed NEST that consists of Autobots collaborating with U.S. and British soldiers to smoke out rogue Decepticons hiding anywhere in the world. The opening Shanghai sequence where NEST routs a gargantuan unicycle that wrecks more havoc than Godzilla ever visited on Tokyo gets things started off on the right track. The unicycle warns our heroes that the worst is about to befall them in the form of a monstrous entity named 'The Fallen.' <br/><br/>The sequel focuses on a thousand year old object called 'the matrix of knowledge' that provides loads of power to whoever acquires it. The scene shifts from Shanghai to the Witwicky homestead in California where Sam (Shia LaBeouf of ""Disturbia"") announces his plans to attend a prestigious Ivy League university and try to live the life of a normal twentysomething. Sam informs Bumblebee, the yellow Camaro that morphs into a monstrous robot, that he cannot accompany him. Freshmen aren't allowed to have cars on campus. Incredibly, Sam is leaving his super hottie girlfriend, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), who looks sexier than ever. After Sam's parents, Ron Witwicky (Kevin Dunn) and Judy (Julie White), get our hero situated in his dorm, they head off to Europe for a vacation. Sam and Mikaela are having their first relationship struggle. She wants him to utter the L-word ""love"" but he is content only to tell her that he ""adores"" her and they plan to maintain their relationship coast-to-coast via the Internet.<br/><br/>As Sam is unpacking, a shard of the Allspark falls out of his clothing from the first movie and weird things start to happen. Remember, the AllSpark was a mystical cube that contained the key to the Transformers' existence and was thought destroyed in the original movie. Optimus Prime shows up soon afterward and explains trouble is brewing and Sam has a role to play in its resolution, but our hero refuses to participate.<br/><br/>Of course, what Sam wants and what Sam ends up doing are two entirely different matters. In one of his classes, he scans an astronomy book from cover to cover and accuses Einstein of being wrong. Furiously, Sam starts scribbling enigmatic symbols. Later, the Decepticons return in force, steal parts of the AllSpark, excavate Megatron from the bottom of the ocean floor, sink half the U.S. Navy, and set out to destroy not only the Autobots but also the Earth. The Decepticons' primary target is Sam and they perform a full body scan to obtain vital information.<br/><br/>""Transformers"" boasts some spectacular scenes. For example, a robot versus robot mêlée around Egypt's Giza Necropolis, with the evil Devastator, a remarkably mammoth mechanoid, absorbing several construction vehicles so it can scramble atop the peak of a pyramid, is truly a sight to behold. Again, Bay and his scribes cannot inhibit their humor and they show two huge wrecking balls dangling like genitalia between its massive thighs. The scene where the Decepticons resurrect Megatron from the bottom of the ocean is exhilarating to watch. The last thing that you should be thinking about is the nincompoop who decided not to melt Megatron done into a pile of metal so nothing like this could happen. Unfortunately, had they done so it is likely that there would not have been a sequel.<br/><br/>Mind you, ""Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen"" qualifies as a big, dumb, noisy action-paced sci-fi saga that doesn't make any sense and revels in its larger-than-life idiocy. Humans take a backseat to the fracas between the mechanoids until the final moments when only Sam can save the day. Unfortunately, the humor gets entirely out of hand. Sam's college roommate follows him around the globe and spends more time screaming in terror rather than fighting. Agent Simmons (John Turturro) is back acting just as flaky as ever, too. The Ghetto twin Autobots are as obnoxious as Jar Jar Binks was in the ""Star Wars"" prequel. The gags and the pranks displace the drama. The language is often rude and verges on the obscene. The surprises are few and far between. Without enumerating them, we are asked to believe that essential characters can die and never be revived. Anybody who believes for an instant that the Decepticons will vanquish the Autobots is clearly delusional, though it would have been a nice cliffhanger touch on Bay's part to stage an ending similar to ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back."""
"provenelk","6","413","717","20 June 2009"," Great action and visual effects - everything else is dribble
","This film is arguably the most highly anticipated release of the summer, and you can see the pressure must have got to Michael Bay with the amount of crap he put into this movie to lengthen it.<br/><br/>Firstly, i will say the action scenes and visual effects are great, and the addition of new ""hip"" auto-bots is good for young viewers (not anyone else though), but unfortunately you only really see any action until the last half, and then its still separated by unnecessary and tiresome romantic scenes, and even then, the action scenes become tiresome with large amounts of 300 style slow-mo and an obvious intention of Michael Bay to show everyone how great his visual effects are, as well as Megan Fox's boobs for the 14 year olds in the audience. Great Mr.Bay, we can see that, just give us a good film.<br/><br/>The first half is largely made of useless footage of Sam at college and annoyingly frequent comedy scenes with his mum. The whole ""college"" section could have been compressed to about 20 to 25 minutes rather than an hour long.<br/><br/>The plot is very good, and the stuff about the fallen is pretty gnarly. Its just a shame you don't find out about it till about the last third of the film, and there are a lot of plot holes - like why the hell didn't Sam give the splinter to Optimus Prime instead of his lame girlfriend?! But i think if they had started with the plot earlier and cut a lot of the ""inbetween"" they could have made the film a lot more fun.<br/><br/>Overall, it is fun, but the faults become tiresome and therefore make the film tiresome, especially with its long length (2 and a half hours i believe). Worth Seeing yes, but definitely not the blockbuster monstrosity we were all looking forward to.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>Edit: On reading other peoples comments, i want to say to any self respecting film lover, ignore the 1 or 2 star comments, but equally ignore the 9 and 10 star comment. Especially the 9 and 10s which go on about the special effects, i think they need to learn having good special effects doesn't give you a good movie. They'd get along with George Lucas pretty well though..."
"aecioborba-2","2","555","976","11 July 2009"," It's our fault, really...
","In Psychology, we would take this movie as a perfect example of what we  call ""reinforcement"". If people like it, make more of it. If no one  said anything about it, no need to make it again.  So, what did everyone (myself included) talked in the first film? Those  fights were great. Loved the robots, I wanted more of them. Oh, Megan  is hot. Let's get more of her too (if by ""more of her"" you hear ""less  of her clothes"", even better). Oh, Megatron was great, sorry he had a  short time in the screen. And do on.  No one talked about the story of the movie, or how the characters were  different from each other. Of course no one paid any attention to the  dialogues. No one said how great was the continuity of the movie. No  one cared who the characters were. Thus... why bother with any of this?  There was a long time I did not see a movie so bad as this one. I am  still in shock, after 4 days. Director, writer, editor... no one had  any idea of what do to with any of those characters or how to get from  a scene to the other. No one cared for the story, why people should be  in one place or other. The plots are so scattered no one bothered to  think why a character would do something.  So, if you like the characters created in the first movie; if you like  stories; if you would like at least that you ears and/or you  intelligence don't be hurt by the most stupid lines ever told by a  human (or robot) in a movie, be careful with this movie.  But, if you want to see a lot of spare parts fighting each other, would  like to see great battles, don't care for story, dialogues or  continuity, you'll sure like this one, because it has great battle  scenes, bigger and faster than the first one. Then, maybe you'll give  and 8 instead of a 2 to Revenge of the Fallen. Myself, i like that  action scenes be part of the movie, not the movie itself.   So, be careful with the movie. Don't get any higher expectations except  some time to eat popcorn."
"lukalele","7","162","279","29 September 2009"," What I expected
","I'm amazed at some of the reviews on here. Seriously, what did people expect outta this film? Shakespeare? The English Patient? You go to see this for the ridiculous action, awesome special effects and just to have a good time, which is what I had. Yeah, it did seem to overindulge slightly and was slow in parts. Yeah, the humour's cheesy, sometimes painfully so. No surprise there though, let's remember we're watching a film based on kids' toys, not a Bronte novel. It ain't perfect, but if you expected it to be, I'm glad you're feeling let down. For me, it didn't try to be anything it shouldn't have and what it needed to do right, it did.<br/><br/>Mindless, thoroughly enjoyable fun, just like the first one."
"euro_kid111","3","724","1321","29 June 2009"," Seriously...what happened?
","i loved the first transformers, the acting/humour was superb and the action was AMAZING. I was super anxious for transformers 2 and after about an hr I was anxious to leave. I couldn't take it anymore, everything was stepped up to a bad degree. Too loud, too much action, too much horrendous jokes and way too many robots! Half the time i was trying to figure out whos who and there were so many plot holes that bugged me, this all being in the first hr alone. There were three characters that I truly DETESTED, the twin robots and that greasy haired buffoon of roommate, it doesn't get any more annoying than those three. GAHHH and when all three of them were in the same scene I wanted to kill myself."
"hugh_booth","7","86","149","1 July 2009"," Could have been better, but could have been much worse!
","For the most part, this film is the decent thrill ride that the movie going audience is looking for. As an action moving, it has scenes to astound and thrill any avid fan. As a science fiction movie it stands reasonably well. It doesn't over-explain things and doesn't throw in concepts as central plot points that are blatantly impossible (super novas that threaten entire galaxies, I'm talking about you Star Trek). The movie also does relatively well on a comedic note, and from a standpoint of general plot. Though others have complained about the central importance of Sam's role being unlikely and a retread of the first film, it follows through logically from where the first film left off.<br/><br/>Though the film is a lot of fun, it does have its flaws. Unfortunately the humor descends to the low brow a little too often. Also the Autobot twins that Michael Bay apparently loved so much were frightfully annoying. They did also lean towards offensive cultural stereotypes a little heavily. It is unfortunate because a couple of their funnier lines could have been delivered just as well by completely different characters. In fact they might have been funnier coming from a more straight laced Autobot. The use of the twins in pure Jar Jar Binks fashion (though not quite as irritating) was unfortunate given how many underused robots there were. The comment about Sam's roommate's bravery could have been unexpectedly hilarious coming out of Arcee.<br/><br/>Most of the other glitches in the film were relatively minor and not worth mentioning, though the writers could use a geography lesson. If you enjoy action films and don't need a deeper artistic message, Revenge of the Fallen is well worth the watch."
"college_bound_cutie_1987","8","91","162","24 June 2009"," An Action-Packed Thrill Ride
","We all have a feeling of dread when we heard of a sequel going into production when referring to a movie that we enjoyed. Especially if that movie is based on something left over from our childhood. While the first Transformer movie was enjoyable, Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen exceeded all of the expectations I could have possibly had while all the while blowing the first movie out of the water.<br/><br/>~Possible Spoilers~ Shia LaBeouf turns in a finely tuned performance that exemplifies his growth from child star to emerging actor. Josh Duhamel returns as Lennox as a side character with his own plot that quickly steals the scene. Megan Fox was the only low spot in the cast, highlighted mostly in action scene involving little dialogue and a lot of bounce. The special effects were amazing and the exotic locales were excellent as the journey takes the viewer on a whirlwind tour of both the world and human history. Michael Bay pulled no punches in the witty banter involving the giant robots and their human counterparts. The plot though stretched at times was credible in the overall action of the story. Clearly audiences know better than to go to a Michael Bay film if they want an Academy Award winning performance.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was not to be missed. It will be one of the hardest movies to beat this summer in the action department as young adults and adults alike will enjoy the action, drama, romance and scenery."
"danishcuti","7","103","187","25 June 2009"," Pure Action
","Lets just start with the critics. I have a lot of respect for critics and their opinions but lets face it Transformers 1 and 2 are not made for critics. They REALLY didn't like the sequel and I in all honesty see why. But, and it's a big but, I am the kind of person who enjoys a good Oscar movie and a good sob in a sad movie, but i am still a HUGE fan of action movies. <br/><br/>For me personally an action movie is crude language, many explosions, a hero of some sorts, and a decent soundtrack and for me Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen does indeed deliver on that point. The movie is visually fascinating and ""explosive"", and I knew what to expect so I was therefore not disappointed. <br/><br/>After giving myself time to consider the movie more clearly, yes, there are points I could have been without or enjoyed more of. Megan Fox's and Shia LaBeouf's lovey dovey stuff could have been left out for all I care. The sense of humor does indeed border on the idiocy lvl but todays generation might not be as clever as others. I would have loved to see Devastator more than others, but drives me to the same conclusion as Spider-Man 3 where I would have loved to see Venom a lot more than I did. The action scenes (and there are a lot of them) are a bit crowded and you do have to be in a certain state of mind to be able to focus well.<br/><br/>But all in all the movie is visually dynamic and has the most outstanding special effects since the last Transformers. It was genuinely entertaining. As for stars i give the explosions 2 stars, the SFX 3 stars, Shia LaBeouf 1 star, Josh Duhamel 1 star and the robots 2 stars leaving the total at 9/10. <br/><br/>Go watch it if not for the massive explosions or just because you want to see the sequel see for the impressive ability Michael Bay has to bring the wildest toys to life yet again."
"sandipbharj","7","313","603","18 June 2009"," Fun silly film.
","Adapting Transformers into live-action movies is always going to be a bit of a nasty challenge to get right, but I enjoyed most of this action-packed extravaganza. It doesn't have that same magic of seeing Transformers battle for the first time and it seeming like a spectacle, but it makes up for it by having more action and more explosions.<br/><br/>So a quick few words on what I thought of the first movie.<br/><br/>Transformers 1 HATED: - Megan Fox's 'acting'. It's absolutely all form and no charisma; - most of the Transformers talking; - the scene where the Transformers are hiding in the backyard of Sam's house while he searched for the spectacles in his room (just seemed to take all the seriousness away from the Transformers and portray them as silly).<br/><br/>Transformers 1 LOVED: - watching the Transformers battle each other; - Shia Labeouf doing his great mix of nutty comedy/nervous acting. <br/><br/>Transformers 2 - HATED: - Film tends to sag in the middle when the action slows down to progress some of the silly plot. Transformers is not a film about plot, it's about the action - just keep it coming and don't try to make a story from it because it's RIDICULOUS; - Megan Fox still looks amazingly hot but cannot act to save her life. You may as well just put a cardboard cut-out of her next to Shia Labeouf and it'll do the same job for a fraction of the cost; - A scene towards the end of the movie where there is a small ""dream sequence"" of sorts, and the word ""destiny"" is mentioned. I almost vomited. The word 'ridiculous' doesn't quite do it justice; - The girl that Sam meets at college and who she is. I am simply AMAZED that they actually let that whole thing get put into the movie - it just doesn't fit into the Transformers world and leaves stupendous plot holes and questions; - There isn't enough slow-motion in the action sequences for you to take it all in - Transformers trying to be ""funny"" - yuck.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 - LOVED: -The action is mind-blowing. This is what you go to see the film for, and apart from the slow-mo flaw, it's pretty breathtaking and surprisingly violent too; - Sam and his parents are genuinely hilarious.<br/><br/>And that's it.<br/><br/>I went to see Robots doing battle, and for 90% of the movie that's what I got. This isn't a film for those looking for a smart plot or realistic story lines and physical motion - this is something to visually gawk at, and sonically admire. This is special effects without having to think about it. There are plenty of other films that showcase superb character development and plot, but this isn't it and nor does it try to be. <br/><br/>This is a live-action movie that you could easily imagine being a cartoon. If that's what you want to see I think you'll enjoy this as pure entertainment. If you didn't like the first movie I can't see how you would like this one, but for those who liked watching metal smash into other metal, you'll be buzzing from this flick."
"Ostrumation","Null","12","17","13 May 2010"," It Suffers The Sequel Curse, A Lot, But It Has A Few Redeeming Qualities
","Michael Bay may not be a great director, but ""Transformers"" was surprisingly a decent movie. That movie did pander to the masses, but it had enough action, effects and a decent plot to keep it going through its two-hour runtime. Unfortunately, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" doesn't do this very successfully.<br/><br/>The main flaw that ruined this movie was the story. Okay, not every movie has to have a big, complex meaning-of-life story, but the story still could've been halfway decent or consistent. From the opening sequence to Sam going to college, it was already a big mess. The idea of The Fallen getting revenge was a good idea, it's just too bad that the movie wasn't good enough. The unnecessary humor brought it down even more. The first movie had its funny moments, but some of the jokes fell flat. In this film, they're even worse. Wheelie humping Megan Fox's leg was out of place and flat out unfunny. Oh yeah, the twins. They were out of place and the filmmakers obviously made them out to be ""hip"" or whatever. I bet it's even worse if you're a big Transformers fan. Most of the jokes are now dated, all 2009 jokes. On the positive side, the action sequences were great. Every one of them. The final battle was dragged out, but still exciting. It was actually a movie where I was waiting for the ending.<br/><br/>Great special effects don't always make a great movie, and ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" proves it. Sure it outdid the first movie, but that shows that the filmmakers only care about the money instead of making a great movie. ""Transformers"" is great material for a big budget blockbuster, but instead, the movie gets screwed up and its made to cater to the masses instead of being faithful to its source material while being audience-friendly.<br/><br/>The movie was basically action scene after action scene with weak and rather boring dialogue-driven scenes in-between. There's no real character development and the story is a giant mess. I went in expecting the filmmakers to deliver a sequel that made improvements to the flaws present in the original ""Transformers"". Instead, they delivered a giant, profitable mess. It's a shame, because the action sequences were the high points. <br/><br/>A 6.1 out of 10."
"sbrobin","2","422","842","29 June 2009"," Absolutely awful
","I wasn't expecting much going into this film. I'm aware of director Michael Bay's history and his habit of making mindless popcorn films with huge explosions, scantily-clad women, and awful cheesy dialogue. However, I thought the first film was okay for what it was, so figured maybe I would like the sequel. I was dead wrong. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is the most ridiculous campy, poorly-written and poorly-directed piece of garbage to come out this year. The acting by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox is average, and the special effects are extremely well done. That's about the only saving grace for this film.<br/><br/>The writing is so unbelievable you almost have to see it to believe it. At one point a character actually utters the line ""not on my watch."" No one in the history of the military has ever said this outside of a film. Reading over the screenplay, you would think it was some terrible Transformers fan faction written by a tenth grader and posted to the Internet. The dialogue is HORRIBLE. This would be a great movie if it was targeted to 9 year olds, but the overt sexual references and language suggest an older demographic. Maybe it's because Bay is trying to please a wide range of people, and maybe that's why we have jokes made about Transformer Testicles and there's a scene where a transformer (with a Jersey accent much less) tries to hump Megan Fox's leg. What possible reason is this robot trying to hump her leg? Is that the way they procreate? There is ZERO excuse for it other than a cheap laugh. And that's ALL the jokes are, cheap laughs. I honestly would not have been surprised to see a transformer fart in this film, or maybe a scene where a transformer gets high. It wouldn't matter if it made sense because an intoxicated transformer would be HILARIOUS. But don't worry, because there's plenty of scenes of Sam's mother accidentally getting high at college and proceeding to follow the Robin Williams/Jim Carey acting formula of physical humor. Then there are Skids and Mudflap - two Decepticons who can't read, speak in ""jive,"" act like gangster-wannabes, and fight a lot. One of them even has a gold tooth (I am not making that up). I am one of the last people you will meet who cares about things being PC or will ever claim anything is racist unless it is blatant, but this was a BLATANT stereotype. I cannot believe this made it into the movie. I wouldn't call it racist, but if these characters had actually been human, the NAACP would have freaked out.<br/><br/>This movie is also insanely long, at a running time of 2.5 hours. This probably could have been avoided if there wasn't so much slow motion footage of people running. I was miserable after the first 45 minutes. Bay should have cut at a minimum, the last half hour off of the movie. The action scenes, while good, were way too confusing. The robots are so complex you can't tell what is happening since it's so fast and you can't figure out Transformers: ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is not Armageddon. It is not Bad Boys. It is definitely not the Rock. Say what you will about those films, they at least had somewhat decent plots and required some brain activity. This movie is nothing but pure mindless action, awful jokes, and gratuitous shots of Megan Fox (and only one of those is a good thing)."

","Most people before me have said this already. This movie stinks. When I heard that Michael Bay was at the helm of the first Transformers movie, I was very worried but then by some fluke of nature he actually managed to pull off a watchable movie, perhaps because he was kept on a tight leash by the studio.<br/><br/>This debacle of a sequel is another story. Bay must have been given full power over this one due to the success of the first. Big mistake. This guy can’t make a decent, realistic and entertaining movie. He makes action/soft porn trash. A good script, story or dialog are just inconvenient afterthoughts for him and it shows. He probably thinks he can distract the audience away from these gaping holes by adding a lot of nonsensical action and unfunny humour.<br/><br/>Sorry Mr. Bay you can’t fool people all the time and the people who grew up with the transformers are absolutely hating this movie. I heard that you didn’t want to make the first movie because you didn’t even like the transformers but you became very keen for the sequel after the first movie made so much money for you. Here’s a tip: lay off the third and let a real director and a real team make that one for us because you have just totally trampled on the transformers legacy."

","No more Michael Bay, no more Shia Labeouef, maybe no more Megan Fox. When you attach your name to a project like this, hopefully fans will not give future projects done by these people record breaking box office feats. I'm embarrassed that I supported the cause.<br/><br/>One of the poorest acting, directional, and written efforts I have seen in a long time in modern cinema. <br/><br/>The scoop: This movie is good for a couple of scenes where the audience might be like 'cool!' due to CGI effects. There is a couple of cheap laughs from some other scenes. If that entertains you, great, there are lots of action movies out there for you. However, if you're reading a review on IMDb, you've likely separated well done movies from poorly done movies, and at least seen a couple in the top 250. To the reader, don't see this.<br/><br/>I left the movies mad. I wonder what other directors think when they see a screening of this film. The story is near non-existent, there are so many plot holes, or unexplained courses of action this movie takes... it really is unbelievable that the script was given an okay by any film studio. <br/><br/>Here's the thing : the target audience is obviously young kids or early teens. I think back to when I was 11 or 12 and I saw Men in Black in the theatres. I was entertained then, it's at least plausible that 12 year olds could be somewhat entertained by this now. However, I am still entertained by 'younger'generation stuff like spongebob, south park, and even beast wars. This didn't do it for me at all. <br/><br/>Similarly to how family guy uses the strategy 'hey people love our interchangeable jokes in early episodes, let's overload our new episodes with the same jokes'.... Michael Bay employs 'hey people love the cgi and megan fox in the first one... let's overload the film with sex overtones, explosions, and fight scenes'... and then at the last minute tried to fit a story around it.<br/><br/>This is the kind of film that makes a person angry that they aren't in Hollywood directing films, because most could do better than this."

","Make no mistake, a great number of people will be entertained by this flick and it offers, well, to say the least, a few aircraft carriers full of special effects for your money. Sadly, that's about everything good there is to say about ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"". Not only was the huge number of negative reviews for this film justified, but the second cinematic installment in the ""Transformers"" series is really paradigmatic of everything movies should not be.<br/><br/>It all starts with the sub-par acting of Shia LeBeouf, which, by now at least, no longer comes as a surprise. Megan Fox, who plays the admittedly hot Mikaela Banes, doesn't really help either, as her role seems to be limited to bumping into stuff, falling and subsequently finding herself in ready-made bikini model poses, cleavage wide open. The story, if that is what we can call what little is left when we subtract 140 minutes of explosions from the film, is so blatantly drenched in in-ya-face product placement that even the most bullshit-resistant viewers will find it hard to look away.<br/><br/>Now you might say: ""Fair enough, but wasn't the first 'Transformers' just the same?"". Well, here's where the real problems of ""Revenge of the Fallen"" start. While the original ""Transformers"" had some genuinely original, funny and gripping moments, ""Revenge of the Fallen"" largely lacks these elements. Most of the transforming and warping sidekicks are simply robotic versions of stale clichés, the humor has taken a turn for the worse and hardly any suspense builds up at all. It is this general lack of originality that makes for the new ""Transformers"" film to be so much less than good and entertaining popcorn cinema.<br/><br/>150 minutes of random stuff blowing up without any real substance to the plot, cliché upon cliché, bad actor upon bad actor, and every so often a pseudo-moralistic lecture given to the audience by some over-sized pile of talking CGI-rubble - I can do without that kind of wisdom! Even just thinking about how many more people are going to watch this movie rather than one of this summer's real cinematic gems, such as Charlie Kaufman's ""Synechdoche, New York"", makes me a little sick!"
"BeastWarsTransformers","10","59","107","26 June 2009"," Ignore the HATERS, Transformers 2 ROCKED THE HOUSE!
","Despite all the critical dribbles, I enjoyed this film. I remember two years ago, critics were very harsh on the first Transformers film. They said it was all about special effects with no heart and no story. As a fan of the Beast Wars cartoon, I was interested but had low expectations. I went in with nothing to expect, but, boy was I blown away, the first film had great action, terrific characters, and it was a fun popcorn movie that made over $700 million worldwide and got three Academy award nominations in the process.<br/><br/>Two years later the critics are at it again, calling this an empty vessel, I say they couldn't be more wrong, the audience I saw this film with was cheering at the action sequences, laughing at the jokes, and they seemed to have a really good time, in fact, I heard a tremendous amount of cheers and loud clapping when it was over. It seems audiences, who actually pay to see these types of popcorn films, like it far more than the critics who always dislike Michael Bay's movies.<br/><br/>This is the type of movie, similar to 1996's Independence Day, which was also trashed by many critics. It's a fun, loud, and cool popcorn movie that will have you on the edge of your seat. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is easily my favorite film of 2009 so far. IGNORE THE CRITICS, THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIFIC!"
"l_biu","4","257","519","21 June 2009"," A real snoozer.
","Transformers 2 suffers from complete utter lack of direction. The movie tries to be so many things and fails at all of them. It tries to be a comedy but the jokes have all been done time and time again, it tries to be dark but with no real threat and characters coming back to life it fails at this, it than tries to be a family adventure movie but with the crude language and sexual innuendo the movie fails at this too.<br/><br/>The plot is non-existent. There does not seem to be anything other than MacGuffins to get from A to B. This would be fine if the characters are interesting or at least relatable. Not the case for this film as every single character is a thin as a paper. Even Shia, who I thought was the best thing in the first movie, loses all his charm and charisma and sleep walks through this.<br/><br/>The action is surprisingly dull....the camera-work is just to shaky and far too close-up to grasp what is happening on screen. Robot fights take nothing more than 5 minutes at a time and the similarity of the robots designs makes it hard to see who you are supposed to be rooting for. Its even harder when none of the robots are even introduced properly.<br/><br/>The first hour of the movie is easily the best part. Some of the charm is still intact. The film than comes to a crashing halt and gets very very boring. The finale does not live up to the build up and you find yourself looking at your watch or slightly drifting off. Continuous explosions, with no feel of threat or danger, draws you completely away from what's happening on screen.<br/><br/>The first movie was decent but lost its charm after repeat viewing...Transformers 2 does not have any charm to begin with. A dull, boring mess."
"demalex50","1","177","354","29 June 2009"," 2h30 I'll never get back :(
","I've created an IMDb account only for this movie, to let people know how terrible it was...<br/><br/>I'm not really a big fan of robot/sci-fi movies, but my boyfriend made me go as I had made him watch the last Ben Affleck :) Anyways, even tho I'm not a fan, I thought it'd be a bit like Iron Man, which I liked a lot. When I saw Spielberg was involved in it, I was relieved and thought it was going to be good. Hell was I wrong... even my boyfriend (who's a programmer, understand: robot/high-tech fan) hated the movie. As everyone said: no plot, just a lot of bangs and booms and boobs. <br/><br/>It is true that technically-speaking, the special effects are impressive. But it's not the 1st time we see big robots and explosions. Besides this good point, the rest of the movie is kinda sad. It's like they made a salad: hot chick? check. robots? check. fire and explosions? check. US saving the world? check. lame-ass jokes? check. stereotypes? check. They gathered all ingredients they could think about and just mixed them up together.<br/><br/>Something else: I'm French, and the french clichés in American movies are getting really annoying. No we don't eat snails (unless you go in an extremely expensive, high-class, very traditional restaurant and specially order snails because you're a tourist) and we (at least my generation) don't know who the mime Marceau is. Also they should get their maps straight cos the Eiffel Tower is not where it was seen in the movie... But I'm getting carried away, that's a detail.<br/><br/>Actors: bad, bad, more bad. I mean, I'm sure I could do a better job and wouldn't cost as much. However, I must say Bravo Megan Fox for keeping your jeans white after running around in the desert and I want the same lip gloss she has! :P Seriously, how hard is it to keep things a tiny bit more realistic? Stop making us girls feel awful about ourselves! It'd be OK if Sam Witwick was hot too. But nooooo, we have a nerd instead of eye-candy. Not fair. Actually there was Josh Duhamel but he's not the hero so it doesn't count :)<br/><br/>Robots: hard to tell which are which. sound of clinging metal was annoying in the end (but didn't prevent me from drifting off during the last fight...). nothing to say really. It's all seen before, nothing new, nothing exciting.<br/><br/>Plot: well... I'm gonna guess it was all written in one night, 1 month before releasing the movie maybe? proof is: they mention Obama and the swine flu. There's nothing original/exciting in the plot, you can easily anticipate on everything, it's just very boring.<br/><br/>To sum up: it's ""Cinema week"" in France right now, and all movies are only 3euros (4$). I'm glad for that as I consider 3euros is still too expensive for that pile of s***. it's OK if you're only interested in the special effects (again, they're good, but nothing new there). Otherwise, don't bother. There's loads of good movies."
"luvferrets03","7","38","67","30 June 2009"," An alright summer film...a few spoilers!
","I thought the sequel was almost as good as the original film. It is a Michael Bay film. There are lots of action sequences and explosions, mixed in with humorous and witty dialog. I thought some parts of the film seemed to repeat the first (the desert fighting scenes looked like the exact same sets). But I also thought that Michael did a good job of adding onto the characters. For example, I did not know that the Decepticons could take a human form. And there are some plot points I would like to change or have worked out better, but I can live with it the way it is. It is definitely a ""Transformers"" film by Michael Bay. He does not try to be something he is not, and that is why I adore him as a director.<br/><br/>Go see this film if you enjoyed the first one, or if you like Michael Bay's other work. Leave the high expectations at home."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","53","97","10 March 2011"," Some aspects could have done with much more work, but it is not that bad
","I quite liked the first Transformers and this film. Neither of the Transformers films are masterpieces, but neither are terrible movies either in my opinion. And yes, this is coming from a fan of the 1984 series and 1986 movie. Transformers 2:Revenge of the Fallen is not the best of the year, but it is a long way from the worst either(not like The Ugly Truth or Dragonball Evolution). And is it the worst movie of all time as I have seen in some reviews and various message boards? For me, not even close.<br/><br/>Does this mean it is completely flawless? No. The characters are rather shallow(the twins especially, they are offensive too), the story is formulaic with some of the scenes with the humans on the dull side, the Autobots get nowhere near enough screen-time and some of the script is weak going overboard with some lowbrow and immature humour. In regards to the latter though, it does have a few humorous and exciting parts so it wasn't quite as glaring as the characters and story problems and to be fair to those two problems the original suffered from the same problems exactly.<br/><br/>But when it comes to the visual spectacle and effects, I can't fault this movie at all, the whole film does look amazing and the effects are in my view some of the best of the year. And the action sequences are very thrilling, there isn't too much and it makes up for the not-so-involving exposition with the human characters. The soundtrack is also fantastic, and the sound is very impressive in its authenticity. The acting is an improvement, Shia LaBoeuf is likable enough and while she is far from a great actress Megan Fox has improved as well. John Tuturo and Kevin Dunn are great too, but my favourite characters are Megatron and especially Optimus Prime voiced wonderfully by Hugo Weaving and Peter Cullen. Another improvement is Michael Bay's direction, I can find it murky and unfocused but it was serviceable here.<br/><br/>Overall, an okay movie that gets some not-entirely deserved but understandable flack. 6/10 Bethany Cox"
"matchitehew","1","157","315","10 July 2009"," Drivel. It's shameful that this will be remembered in the Transformers legacy
","Well, I enjoyed it as it happened, but after some reflection...I've come to the understanding that this film is very, VERY messy.<br/><br/>A lot of people defending this film are saying the action scenes are spectacular. Sure, they're spectacular...if you like trying to figure out just who's who and what's going on. Most of the time the characters are so obscured by objects/smoke that you can't see the ""action"" that everyone's raving about. When they're not behind something, the camera's changing every five seconds that you can't focus on the mess before you. The only cool part about these action scenes is the intense way some of the Transformers are disfigured.<br/><br/>The over-all plot, story, and script of this thing comes together in the most ugly way possible. Most people are complaining about it being too all over the place, or that there wasn't one at all. Unfortuneatly, it's hard not to agree on both fronts. There was no flow, no suspense, no build up, no up, no down, just one flat line of point a to point b to point c. The intense battles would have been made more intense had they been preceded by some sort of build up, but they just kind of...happened. The plot in and of itself has the makings of something epic. MULTI-FILM EPIC. The script used to flesh out this story was mediocre AT BEST. It could have been so much more than what it was, it could have spaced apart plot points by delving into the characters (specifically: the transformers). Instead, the film was littered with unnecessary, and often crude jokes.<br/><br/>Heck, this overly cartoony humor was barely present in the first film. Now it's been ramped up to over 9000, and it severely offsets any emotional impact the film might have had. Most of it would have been better suited to something like Aqua Teen Hunger Force, at least there crude humor comes off clever. It's really sad we had to put up with all of that instead of enjoying some actual quality time with our favorite machines.<br/><br/>And, speaking of which, the lack of Transformer character development presents itself yet again. You would think after fans complained about the infrequent amount of Transformer screen time in the first, then things would have been different now. Nope. We still don't know what they're thinking, who they are as living beings, or really anything about them except that they shoot at the opposing force. And why would they just sit around in car mode when they were hidden? They came from a planet where they walked around freely, one would think they'd enjoy being able to just be themselves.<br/><br/>The annoying liberties that were taken here in the name of artistic licensing are nauseating. I understand this is an ""adaptation"" and that things aren't going to be 100% to the source material. However, completely rewriting a character's personality is like killing off a loved one and replacing them with someone completely different. They also went waaaay to far with appearance, as well. Being a fan of a character from the series isn't' going to matter much here because there's a good chance they've been overhauled beyond recognition. Heck, the only one that barely made the transition from cartoon/comic to this blight of a film is Optimus Prime. No one else even remotely resembles their previous incarnations. From personality to appearance, this piece of work tramples all of the work of those before it...AND the fans they had sought to please.<br/><br/>The film's treatment of characters like Sky/Jetfire is utterly appalling. It's proof that the people involved in this film don't actually give a crap about the characters in their movie. Then again, the lack of character development makes that just as obvious.<br/><br/>The character design here is also noticeably different from the previous film. In the last film, all of the machines were quite bulky, a little more humanoid. The new ones here all seemed to be cartoony or very streamlined. The mini transformers all seemed to sport bug eyes, where as the ones last time around did not. Why would this new batch, decepticon and autobot alike, differ so much from the others? It's not like they were all brand new, they'd been around as long as the others. I dunno, different art direction from film to film grates on my nerves, especially when it comes to character design.<br/><br/>And, for the love of sanity, WHY can't they treat women like people? If I wanted to gawk at girls who were just there because they're pretty I would look up questionable material online. I honestly feel sorry for her and any other actress who doesn't actually get a chance to show off any acting talent they might have. I don't have a problem with them showing a girl as being pretty in the film...but if that's all they concentrate on then they can just get right the heck out.<br/><br/>The rest of the talent on hand might as well have been treated the same way. No one was really given an opportunity to actually do much acting, it was all jokes and running.<br/><br/>The movie's fun, but if you have a brain you'd better shut it off or your going to find yourself wanting to bring some pain to the creators of this drivel. And for the love of pete, just because it's an ""action"" film doesn't mean the film can't have substance. It's possible to have a load of brain-flexing story AND explosions."
"Sarfield-1","9","87","169","24 June 2009"," Itty bitty minor gripes can't prevent this movie from being the top film top see this summer
","I marked this comment as containing spoilers as a precaution. I reveal here no crucial plot elements or details, but if you want to know absolutely zero about the film then heed the warning.<br/><br/>I was seeing a lot of bad reviews for this movie on other sites that I thought were really not justified so I decided to write one myself. Thing is, a lot of these movie sites or whatnot have a certain number of reviewers and they just send any of them to write a review of a movie, without proper consideration of what reviewer they are sending. Let's face it, different people like different things. It's no use sending a reviewer to critique a movie when they notice all the wrong things. But the movie: The bottom line is, this movie is fantastic. I am a fan of Bay's earlier work and don't like much of his later stuff. But with the Transformers series he has me hooked. His directing fits the feel of the Transformers perfectly. I guess hats off go to Spielberg for knowing whom to choose to direct these movies. <br/><br/>The one gripe I have about the film, and I'll get it out of the way first, is the earlier comedy sections. The film keeps its humor present throughout, which is great, but the earlier college section is a bit heavy with it, particularly Sam's mom being overplayed. I like her and she is hilarious often, but at those scenes it's just too over the top and could have been dropped altogether. Having said that, it doesn't detract from the rest of the film and does make the bond between Sam and his parents stronger, fleshing them out as characters which is very important.<br/><br/>Many people's concern is that there are too many human stories in the films, and the transformers come second. That is true, but also necessary, and the film is better for it. Watching these huge robots fighting to protect the humans is what makes them so lovable. The story would not be as good without people. The robots are there as guardians, their presence is majestic. If the entire movie would be only with them it would take a huge chunk away from their charm. In short, the movies work best this way, and it's a good thing that Bay knows this.<br/><br/>The human characters are fewer this time around, which is good because it is a tighter story. The provide a lot of comic relief but also some very touchy moments between Sam and Optimus. The film's plot is very much about the unison of humans and Autobots, as well as Sam's growing up and taking responsibility. There is some toilet humor, as in the first one. It may bother some but it's never too abundant or in really bad taste. It's a simple movie, and it's humor is likewise. It's funny more often than not, and when it isn't it doesn't bother either, just raises a grin.<br/><br/>And now to the good stuff, the action. Well, when I left the cinema I was absolutely speechless. I couldn't utter a word, but I knew that I had to see it again real soon. The action is just spectacular. The animation on the robots is beyond superb. Bay's signature camera-work is still present but it's never in a way which you can't follow what's going on - it just adds to the sense of realism, seeing gigantic creatures going at it in front of your eyes. One scene which is perhaps too hectic is in the beginning, but it is short and serves as an intro, so it's really more about that hectic feeling than anything. <br/><br/>The story itself, as I've mentioned, is tighter this time and that's a good thing. We see very clearly what's going on on each side of the conflict, with the robots getting a lot of solo screen time. It also relies more heavily on Transformer lore, which should please some fans. I know I was pleased by it. The story wraps up nicely. It does leave an opening for a sequel, but on the same level as Strarscream's short flying away scene in the first film. It's just to let us know the war isn't over. But the story for this film gets it's ending, so we're not left with a cliffhanger. <br/><br/>To conclude, I'll just say this film exceeded my expectations. It was a feel-good film, with good acting and characters, good story, and unbelievable action. It's a thrill from start to finish.It's not Oscar material, but it was never made to be. You can't judge anything based on criteria it doesn't attempt to achieve. Overall, within its own genre, it's an excellent film."

","My opinion, this movie is one the best cinematic events of 2009. The special effects were definitely the driving force that made this movie so successful at the box office. Now for those of you who had problems with the story, just take some time while watching this movie and put more focus into it. Then you will see that there is much more than meets the eye.<br/><br/>For instance, in the beginning when Optimus Prime reveals that the transformers race arrived on Earth many years ago, this opens the doorway into the unknown origins of the transformers. When Starscream says ""the boy will not escape us, we have him in our sights."" He is talking about the the Decepticon spy who is watching Sam Witwicky disguised as a college student named Alice. The scene where Jetfire speaks about the Fallen and the seven primes shows us that the Fallen is the original deception and that the transformers were once ruled by seven great leaders. This take us deeper into the ancient origins and enter through the gateways into the massive transformers universe. Upon revealing these elements from the storyline, it is clear that there is a great amount of depth and substance in this movie, you just have to look for it.<br/><br/>I will admit that the storyline isn't as solid as it could have been. The characters should have been developed with much more love and care and the humor was foolish and unnecessary at some points. But overall, this was a very entertaining blockbuster and a decent sequel."

","Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is directed by Michael Bay and jointly written by Alex Kurtzman, Ehren Kruger & Roberto Orci. It stars Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox , John Turturro, Ramón Rodríguez, Josh Duhamel & Tyrese Gibson. Ben Seresin is the cinematographer and the music director is Steve Jablonsky. <br/><br/>The Autobots and the US military have formed an alliance called NEST, their singular goal is to rid the World of Decepticons. But now they face their biggest challenge, because heading for Earth is the ultimate destroyer, The Fallen. <br/><br/>Michael Bay has never been the most subtle of film directors, he knows how to have fun, and in the main he knows how to drag his target audience along with him for a slam bang good ride. After the hugely enjoyable Transformers film, and after its subsequent success, he has crafted a sequel that he felt needed a more is more approach, where everything is bigger and louder and nothing pauses for breath. The end result is a dizzying ball of entertainment that's sadly devoid of substance. If ever there was a film to be put forward as OTT then Transformers 2 is a leading candidate. The plot is thin yet unnecessarily made complex by the writers, who you feel are trying to be heard in amongst the eye candy carnage, while Bay even resorts to cheap moments of crudity to get some laughs for his film. His cast are fine, yes Megan Fox seems to only serve as a drawing in weapon for the randy teenagers, but she still works well off of the ever likable LaBeouf, who in turn continues to deliver a good line in action comedy performance. Pity, tho, that in a film that's so big, with everything expanded, that John Turturro doesn't get more screen time. Only he, with his visual comedy at optimum, can make a metal testicle scene seem less crass than really it is. <br/><br/>When all is said and done, all the human actors are playing second fiddle to the Bots/Cons and metal critters. To that end the film is exciting, undeniably so. Sure some of the set-ups riff on other movies that have gone before it, but Bay is the master of Bayhem, there's just too much fun to be had if one is prepared to forgive its shallow center. With a third film on the go and set to be released in 2011, without Megan Fox (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley slipping into the considerably short skirt this time), it's anyone's guess what we will actually get this time. Will Bay pull back a touch and give us a story, with characters given time to breath? Or will it be bigger and noisier than part 2? You hope it's the former, but even if it's the latter, it will be fun for those after a certain level of popcorn explosive cinema. Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is like a great ride at the funfair, one you have been on four times in a row. You know you have had a great time, but as your head starts to spin and your stomach feels queasy, you wonder if it was just too much overkill? 6/10"
"Darkslide92","7","41","75","30 June 2009"," Overall, it is a movie that satisfies fan service.
","Before I begin: people, we all know the movie was not so good, but NO movie deserves 1 star as you are doing unless it is an absolute piece of crap like Epic Movie or Love Guru. 1 star ratings are for the lowest of the low and are beyond description of how bad they are. This is not one of them. OBVIOUSLY this movie had more going for it than those pieces of no good crap, seriously people, put more thought into your ratings. This movie was not like Epic movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the film, but I also know it was not a very good film. Here is why...Michael Bay. Bay, as we all know, is still a child at heart...a VERY little child. Which means he finds things like sex jokes, explosions, and fooling around hilarious. We were unfortunate enough to have him put on the transformers series, honestly anyone else would have made them better. He took his inner child and spilled it all over this movie. Between robot humping, explosion after explosion, farting jokes, and overdone closeups of Megan Fox we can see the Michael Bay traits in this film. All this added together ruined a lot for me. At times it was almost hard to watch, especially when Sam's mom gets high which was not necessary, yet Bay finds it amusing. You all get the idea, Michael Bay is the reason this film had all it's negatives.<br/><br/>Here is why I enjoyed the film. Simply because I love action. This movie delivered all of what I wanted to see in the first Transformers when it came to action. In the first one, we say very little fighting especially with Optimus. A lot of people saw the first wanting to see Optimus woop Decepticon butt, however he ended up getting HIS ass wooped. With Revenge of the Fallen, we get an all new badass Optimus Prime whose voice sounds like god, ""I'll take you all on!"". When I was in the theater watching Optimus during the Forest fight, the audience was rooting out loud for Optimus. The last time I saw that happen was during the 2005 King Kong T Rex fight.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie delivers on action but fails on story which is what everyone else has been saying, but don't give it 1 star for that! 1st one had better story but not as much action, this one went vis versa. Big lack of character development in this one, way too many autobots, but it did not ruin the movie for me. What ruined a lot of it was Bay's inner child.<br/><br/>My thought? I think Michael Bay should be pulled off the project and they should put J.J. Abrams on the project. See what he did with Star Trek? Imagine what he could do with Transformers. Let us all pray that Michael Bay does not do this again, or the 3rd movie will full out suck. Pray with me people."

"bnbrossman","10","35","63","26 June 2009"," Not the cookie cutter sequel, which is good.
","This is not a total spoiler, but I do divulge some stuff. I started reading all the reviews on here and I became convinced after seeing the movie that most of these people watched a bootleg of it from the premier on their laptop. I went to the local IMAX to see it. I was quite pleased.<br/><br/>Since Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back, it seems the standard 'first' sequel has become nothing more than an excuse to make a third movie. Back to the Future, The Matrix, Pirates of the Carabian, and even the real Star Trek movies all did this same thing. With the exception of The Matrix they were all great movies. The good guys are left in a precarious situation AND/OR one of them dies (or is missing or captured) and is brought back in the third film.<br/><br/>I'm sorry to tell you that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen does not do this. Rather than make it's plot stretch for two movies instead of one, they in fact just made it all one movie. They also had a choice to make, will we have these movies start taking themselves too seriously, or make it fun? Thankfully the answer was make them fun, which made them more realistic IMO. They kept making jokes and much of it was fresh humor, not the typical same jokes different movie humor. They are starting a few running gags, which is a good thing, we need those.<br/><br/>By NOT having the movie be a super serious plot about two factions of angry robots killing each other and destroying our planet in the process, they opened the door to give the robots personalities. Apparently some folks think this was a bad thing. The writers have been making it perfectly clear the robots in their movies are not assembly line made robots who are discovering their individuality. They are a DNA based biological technology, so like humans, some are smart, some are dumb, some are naughty, and some are nice.<br/><br/>Some have become crazy and senile. My favorite new character from the new movie was this ancient deceptacon turned auto-bot, I don't remember his name, though. I guess he technically died from old age while pretending to be a blackbird jet and has ended up at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum where Sam brings him back to life with a shard from the cube. He's walking around using his gun as a walker-cane rambling about old war stories and talking about the 'good old days'.<br/><br/>The ending was doing well until it got a bit corny and kiddish at one part. This seems to be a common problem with Hollywood movies these days, and maybe it always was. Did this stupid bit ruin the whole movie? Naw, but it could have gotten 9 stars or even 10 stars from me had they avoided bringing in a 'Super Optimus Prime' to beat the bad guys. Thankfully he returns to normal Optimus Prime at the end of the battle so it's not a permanent screw up. The rest of the ending was good though, so don't fret. I'll probably go and see it in the theater again, like I did the first one."

","This movie was amazing, I loved it. I was sad when Optimus Prime died, but I knew he would eventually have to come back because, hes the main Transformer and cannot die. I think that the overall plot was good, a little predictable. The screenplay and graphics are absolutely 15 out of 10. The introduction of Devastator was awesome. John Tuturo makes the movie so much funnier! Worth watching, I may see it again in theaters. Leo is kinda of a stupid role, I did not like his character, but it was okay. I think that the movie started a little suddenly and without explanation, the ending ended really suddenly. It took 5 minutes, between Optimus Prime reviving and blowing up the sun-eater thing, then killing the Fallen.<br/><br/>Go to http://www.yovia.com/blogs/stevenmeyerjr for more information."

","I'm not gonna say that anything bad about this movie. I'm 32 and was so excited while watching it, felt like 10y old boy. I've ate huge bucket of popcorn like in 10 min and was excited since the that movie started. Tbh 2nd part gave me what 1st dint. Optimus pwns Megatron and Fallen so he wasn't as gimp as before. Soundtrack is great. Great 2 battle scenes. What can i say i'm not a critic but if u loved 1st part u'll love 2nd. Megan Fox looks great bit that would it be it :P Never been a fan of a cartoon but Michael Bay did what should be done. Can't wait for 3rd part.<br/><br/>I''ll take u all on ^^"

","I went to a midnight screening of this movie last night with a bunch of my friends and my girlfriend. Let me start off by saying, by far the best movie blockbuster of 2009.It has the best action sequences i have ever seen in a movie and for all you men out there......it has megan fox and more and more of megan fox. The movie begins with Sam going off to college but still wanting to stay with his girlfriend who will be staying in town. His parents are sad but proud that he is going as well. Once there sam begins to have mental breakdowns and begins seeing these symbols. The next 2 hours consist of robot fights with the army and your two heroes all the way leading up to the final battle that will honestly blow your mind. Transformers: Revnge of the Fallen is an action movie for our timeand nothing more. If your looking for a drama or a good story this isn't it. It is for all of you inner transformer fans that use to watch the cartoon every morning and now as your older it has been brought to life. Way better than the first one. (Oh and sit through all of the credits, it'll be worth it). That is my review of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Go see it and tell me what you think."

","This review may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Every time I see this movie, the fun and good action completely distracts me from the plot, which is probably why I am am saying this is a great movie. If you're not a fan of transformers see it but if not, skip it. If you think hard enough, you might begin to fully understand it. If you're talking plot less, read the novel. But rent it either way. If you like it buy it. But i suggest seeing the first one first. And a reason why it might also not make sense, is because some of the events, like the vision, relate to events in the transformers franchise. So researching a little about transformers might help you understand situations like that.also, people who find skids and mudflap (the jar jar twins) annoying, how is that possible when there are barely any screenshots of them!

"tolkien_18","7","29","51","23 June 2009"," As enjoyable as the first.
","While the critics overall have been quite hard on this film, it still serves its purpose well as a summer action blockbuster. I might be a bit biased because of a childhood growing up with early 80's cartoons such as Transformers. But I think that if anyone enjoyed the first film, there is no reason why they will not be entertained by ROTF as it is very similar. <br/><br/>I manage at a theater and screened it yesterday morning at 8am and thought it was excellent. There are fewer one-liners that fall flat in this one and much more laugh-out loud moments than I expected. Some of the action scenes are especially incredible in ROTF, such as the much-lauded forest scene with Optimus battling three Decepticons. One can never have too much Megan Fox either, as Bay loves to highlight her beauty often. There is also more back story to the Transformers history in ROTF, which I appreciated but it might be confusing to those unfamiliar with the toy property. <br/><br/>On the negative side, I thought the film could have been condensed just a bit; it might drag a little on multiple viewings. Hearing slang and curse words come out of Skids and Mudflap was very strange and did not seem appropriate though the Twins are quite funny if you don't let that get to you. Ultimately, though, fan boys and the uninitiated should equally enjoy this epic action popcorn film."

","I fully enjoyed this movie, unlike some viewers. Even though I didn't look as deep into the movie as other critics may have, the actuality of an entertaining, somewhat family friendly, and unique movie plot was accomplished within this movie's length. I enjoyed the acting, I enjoyed the dialogue, and my grandmother, who hadn't seen the first one, immediately caught on to the continued plot. This movie was very well plotted, story boarded, filmed, and edited. I also send kudos to the graphic animators for a truly outstanding job.<br/><br/>As a non-professional story writer, Filmer, actor, and editor, this film was very highly mastered and very well thought through. I am aware people may disagree, and I am in no way trying to counter dict anyone else's thoughts on the movie. I am simply saying it was not ""as bad"" as some people make it out to be.<br/><br/>Remember, we are dealing with something that kids dream of and imagine thousands of possible ""wars"" the transformers fought in as young children playing with action figures of these timeless toys.<br/><br/>It's not easy pulling a movie off like this. Kudos to all of the cast/crew. I enjoyed it very much. Thank you."

","***Possible SPOILERS AHEAD*** Proceed with caution.<br/><br/>I saw Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Loved it. Sure, I'm aware it has flaws. Let's face it...this movie is really a recruitment video for the US Armed Forces. It's better than any of the serious ones we see all day, every day on our TV (""Do You Want To Know More?!""). This movie attempts to make the viewer believe that being a soldier is better than a video game. Why? Because you get to play with the coolest gadgets. The Pentagon knows this and approves or they would not let Michael Bay play with their toys. I've got a serious issue with that but I'll put that aside for right now. <br/><br/>Michael Bay LOVES to blow S#!& up! I love to watch him blow S#!& up and have crazy car chases AND have special effects that are off the chart. That's why I went to see this movie and it pays off big time! There was not much plot (okay...there's NOT a plot) here and the movie, if you stop to think about it for a second (which Bay does not give you because he's constantly blowing S#!& up) you'd pull your hair out at the enormous holes that make up what is supposed to pass for the plot. The acting is rudimentary at best and character development is non-existent. All the scenes are just tacked together to provide a reason for the special effects, car chases, and explosions....<br/><br/>...and I'm OKAY with that!<br/><br/>The only reason I went to see this was for the 'Bay Effect' which translates into over-the-top-adrenaline-rush-sonic-overload. I want to be blown out of my seat by the special effects. I want to be left panting and clutching my ears from the THX surround sound. I want a movie that makes me remember why going to movies in the summer is such a rush.<br/><br/>Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen delivers...big time.<br/><br/>I don't really care that Sam is going away to college and then touches a shard of the cube from the first film. I don't care that he begins to have flashes of super Transformer intelligence that only serves as a plot device anyway to get to the symbols. What I care about is watching Optimus Prime kick Decepticon butt. Sam has to help, of course, by ramming yet another piece of alien technology into Optimus' chest plate. There were the old stand-by Transformers along with some new ones. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor. Buy a bucket of popcorn, a large soda, and treat yourself to the first full-fledged adrenaline rush of the summer movie season. You'll thank me."
"underworldjam","5","167","347","18 June 2009"," Amazing!! But not quite perfect.
","I was more excited to see this film than any other. I finally got to see it at the cinema I manage last night. Overall I can say it was fantastic, I came out with that buzz that I felt after watching the 1st film. The film quickly got started and from there it never really let up, the action was constant with plenty of humour along the way. The style was very much the same as the 1st film just with more of it.<br/><br/>The introduction of new characters brought new elements to the action however there was a lot more potential in this area I feel. The development of the relationship between the leads in this film reminded me very much of Armageddon, it made me actually believe that they were falling in love; no mean feat when Megan Fox's character is paper thin.<br/><br/>Theis film wasn't perfect by any means, the story could have been developed much more and there are things which go unanswered. Normally this would drive me mad but this time didn't really bother me. Lets face it, the 1st film didn't exactly have a flawless storyline, thats not what its about. The point of the film was Michael Bay blowing sh*t up, which as expected was done well and often.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this film, normally it wouldn't come close to a 9 but it has that incredible feel good effect present in the 1st. I came out smiling and wanting more, and that it what Michael Bay and Transformers are designed for."

","Saw the movie yesterday and it was well worth the trip to the cinema even with todays steadily rising ticket prices. In my opinion it was a much better movie than the first instalment. Whereas the first movie got a bit flat in places Revenge of the Fallen hurtles along at the typical breakneck speed one expects from Micheal Bay and never lets up however this time to me the story seems a lot more cohesive and the characters after setup in the first movie are able to live a bit more. Shia LeBouef and Megan Fox work as the leads and the comedy relief from Sam's parents works well and isn't overused. The other supporting cast are solid various recognisable faces from TV (24's Agent Pearce) as well as Josh Duhamal and Tyrese Gibbson reprise their roles and John Turturro was excellent as always i thing Agent Simmons is my favourite character in the whole movie. Now the robots as with the first movie the Autobot and Deception design is awesome and the fight scenes are frantic my only criticism is at certain times so much is going on at once it becomes a bit of challenge to keep up with the action. (Nerd note: it was great to see that Frank Welker is back voicing Decepticons once again even if its Soundwave and not Megatron) The set pieces are vintage Bay and Ill be honest some of the fight sequences are literally jaw dropping. In a nutshell the perfect summer blockbuster and way more satisfying than Terminator Salvation."

","I had quite an outstanding and unique experience watching this film, something happened that I've never experienced before in a movie theatre:<br/><br/>Objectively, this movie is bad. The script is incredibly weak, the plot is full of clichés and can be summed up in several sentences, character development (if existent) is totally predictable and one-dimensional, and the characters are all genuine stereotypes - there are absolutely no ""normal"" people in this movie, every single person/robot that inhabits the world is a silly caricature of some kind. The number of bad things in this movie is beyond measure................except that I didn't notice a single one at all (!!!!) until later, when my friend and I went to grab a beer and pondered about the film a little... <br/><br/>Yup....that's it. When you make yourself comfortable in your cinema chair, the lights go out and this whirlwind of a movie starts, it's something entirely different. Slowly, all of my senses became overwhelmed in a manner that my brain obviously decided to completely ignore every single thing that I look for in a (good) film in favor of pure fun. With my higher functions disabled like that, I just stared at the screen with my eyes almost out of their sockets and my lower jaw on the floor, and absolutely didn't notice the stupidity of some characters, plot holes and clichés, just incredibly enjoying this outstanding feast for my senses. Incredible, just incredible...<br/><br/>With all the advancements in CGI, sound editing and cinema technology overall, I believe this film is (sadly or not?)the prototype for the future of cinema entertainment, where all the things that should make a good quality movie (like intellectual weight) will be dropped in favor of stimulating your most primitive senses to the n-th degree and pure entertainment value that goes straight up through the roof, a concept which is slowly developing in an art form of its own. Because of that, this is (all its numerous and gigantic flaws if you judge it as a ""film"" included) an absolutely amazing movie. If you're into some pure fun, go watch it. Now."

What's better than jaw-dropping Megan Fox and a bunch of robots tearing each other to pieces ?<br/><br/>For those who know the cartoons, the addition of Jetfire, to be honest, was completely unexpected, and it made Optimus...well...one hell of a robot.<br/><br/>9/10 in my book for its quality entertainment"

","I'm not quite sure why this movie is receiving such terrible reviews. The so-called critics (with whom I almost never agree), predictably blasted it. But usually, I get a good idea of the movie from the IMDb crowd. Even though it was getting bad reviews here, my 10 year old son was dead set on seeing, so off to the movies we went.<br/><br/>To my pleasant surprise, I found this movie every bit as entertaining as the first, maybe even better. The action was intense, the machinery was awe-inspiring, and Megan Fox is incredibly HOT! There was humor sprinkled in and John Torturro was a hoot.<br/><br/>I guess if I went to the theater looking for character development, unexpected plot twists, and the unveiling of the meaning of life, this movie would not deliver. But I'd be pretty stupid going to this movie expecting those things now wouldn't I? This movie hits a home run. It is everything it was supposed to be.

"tchockythegreat","5","100","204","27 June 2009"," An ambitious, over-indulgent attempt at making the ultimate brainless summer film
","When discussing Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, one must disregard discussing issues typically inherent to most quality films, such as plot development, character development, and acting ability, because these aspects of film-making are clearly irrelevant to director Michael Bay, especially after considering that this movie is his latest entry in a lengthy resume of largely brainless blockbuster films. Rather, one must discuss what this movie is, and it is Bay's attempt at making the brainless summer movie to end all brainless summer movies.<br/><br/>Looking back on classic summer popcorn movies such as Independence Day, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc., one will notice that most of these films tend to have one of a number of common denominators that draw the masses to them; loud and expensive special effects, a healthy dollop of action-adventure, an escapist premise, and at least one source of T & A. Some are critically acclaimed, most are critically panned for whatever predictable reasons that pompous critics who write for alleged high-brow publications typically come up with. But the bottom line is, these common denominators compose a formula for box-office success, one that moviegoers eagerly turn to time and time again. Based on his directing credits and based on how successful his movies have been, it's clear that Bay knows how to work this formula backward and forward.<br/><br/>With Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Bay is not merely trying to top his first effort in the series from two years ago: he's trying to top every mindless popcorn flick ever made. This might initially sound like I'm overstating his ambition, but if one thinks about the movie for more than the five seconds that Bay expects your attention span to be, one realizes that this is the case.<br/><br/>Bay's ambition must be commended. He knows that people don't go to see a movie about giant killer robots, or even a summer blockbuster period, for the interesting characters, or even a plot line that makes sense. So with this movie, he has masterfully attempted to eliminate all pretensions to the above, because his knows that those things are mostly irrelevant to bolstering a popcorn movie's bottom line. Indeed, after seeing this movie, all I could recall about the story was something about the bad robots needing to blow up the sun for some reason, and all I could remember about the characters was Shia LeBeouf's character running around screaming, John Tuturro's character making unfunny wisecrack after unfunny wisecrack, and Megan Fox's character looking unbelievably hot even while dirty and running for her life in the desert.<br/><br/>Logically, this movie should be the best summer popcorn movie ever made. It's 2 1/2 hours of pulse-pounding relentless escapist fantasy. The special effects are amazing. The action is intense. There are enough shots of Megan Fox looking sexy to fill a few issues of Maxim magazine. It has everything a film fan should supposedly want from a summer popcorn movie, and it's all cranked up to 11.<br/><br/>So why ISN'T it the best summer popcorn movie ever made? <br/><br/>The answer to this question is a painful, age-old cliché. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is unabashed cinematic junk food in its purest form. Cinematic junk food can be tasty, but as the cliché goes, too much of it can be tiring, and will eventually give movie-goers a bellyache from over-indulging. But this isn't even merely cinematic junk food: it's the cinematic equivalent of drinking five extra-large energy drinks in one sitting: it'll get you going initially, and you'll be excited and maybe even a little entertained for awhile. But after the rush is over, you'll realize just how unhealthy for you it is to gorge yourself on something so shamelessly devoid of substance...or you'll become addicted to it and crave it even more.<br/><br/>Considering just how much money this movie is likely going to make, it's safe to say that Michael Bay has addicted enough people to this franchise that he could likely get away with Transformers 3 being nothing but a slide-show of giant robots, explosions and sexy shots of Megan Fox. Don't tell me people wouldn't pay money to watch it, because people are basically paying money to watch it now."
"wolftab-1","7","37","69","25 June 2009"," A Little More Than Meets the Eye
","Those pesky transforming bots are back in Michael Bay's sequel to the successful Transformers. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. This time, the Decepticons are on a mission to kidnap Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBouf) when after a freak accident, Sam discovers the truth about the origins of the Transformers as they plot to find a sacred energy source and use it to destroy Earth;s primary source of energy. It is up to Optimus Prime and the Autobots to once again save the day with a little help from their human friends.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is roundly criticized for the all action fluff he makes and a lot of it is deserved (Pearl Harbor anyone). But, with the Transformers series he has made heavy action laden films that are pretty decent. Teen and pre-teen boys will absolutely go crazy over this sequel. It is loaded with amazing effects and loads of action sequences. Not to mention Megan Fox, who is all sex kitten but at least she knows that is what she is there for. This is not fine art we're dealing with when the producers are Hasbro, so there is a lot of suspension of disbelief with this film. There are an awful lot of plot holes that Mr. Bay seems to be content with letting go. Like, how did Shia get medical attention in the middle of the desert for his broken arm. And, if the whole world is threatened, why is it just the US who takes on the Decepticons? If you can get past these 2 of many examples of plot holes and take the film for the popcorn friendly action flick it is meant to be you will be entertained. Clocking in at 144 minutes, I was surprised at how entertaining it was, with minimal boring moments.<br/><br/>Shia LaBouf is slowly transforming (no pun intended) into a solid actor. He plays the part of Sam truthfully and really lets us believe he is experiencing these extraordinary things that happen to him, with honest responses. It is refreshing to see a young actor not go through the motions in a CGI effects laden film. John Turturro is good as usual. He reprises his role as Agent Simmons and has some genuinely funny moments. However, there is also a major plot hole around him as well. Also, reprising their roles are Sam's parent's. Kevin Dunn who plays Sam's dad does a good job connecting with Shia and in one specific moment, you really believe he is afraid for his son. The same cannot be said for Julie White as Sam's mom, except for a cute sequence on Sam's college campus. Ramon Rodriquez stars as Sam's college roommate Leo, who is a conspiracy nut and a fraidy cat and he plays that up pretty well and he does provide some needed comic relief. All the soldiers do a decent job of being truthful in their circumstance as well. Reprising their voice overs for the main Transformers are Hugo Weaving as evil Megatron and Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. Both sound good as ever.<br/><br/>The love scenes between Megan and Shia are the only thing that feels strained at times and thankfully there attempt at love scenes are kept to a minimum. Mr. Bay knows what the audience wants and rarely disappoints delivering the goods. There also seemed to be an homage to Gremlins which was silly and the relationship between Megatron and The Fallen oddly resembled the Sith in the Star Wars series. 2 new twin Autobots were introduced which have been getting criticized for being racially tinged as they jive talk and always get into scraps and one confesses to not being able to read. I think they were harmless. At times they fell flat but other times they were funny. All in all Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is action packed decent fun."

This is that movie. It has a very good story (those that say there was no story did not pay attention). Some scenes were cut or edited incorrectly but that is just a minor flaw. A lot of the characters that were in the first are here again and they do a great job. Not all movies are for everyone. And movies do not have to have a moral code.

Reprising his role, Shia Lebeouf does a great, great job (did better here than in this first) using his own comedic style and full of emotions. Megan Fox is hotter than ever, had a little more to do here than in the original and did barely OK but still NEEDS to work on her acting, needs to fire her agent pronto!! Newcomer, Isabel Lucas does fairly well with her part. As for others reprising their roles: John Turturro, John Duhamel and Tyrese does their part very well like they did in the first. The Autobots and Decepticons were awesome and cooler than ever.<br/><br/>While, I loved the first Transformers, I loved this one even more. For those awful negative reviews, what you expect? Iron Man, The Dark Knight or Spider-Man 2? Transformers is never known for acting or it's plot, just robots beating the crap out of each other, full of non-stop action & the spectacular special and visual effects which is all we probably need from a Transformers movie. Back to the movie, like I said the visual effects are spectacular and the action almost never lets up. Steve Jablonsky's score is not as epic as the first but still, it's outstanding, very different (in a good way) and ONE of his best in my opinion. Transformers 2 might not take the title for the best summer movie of the year with Up and Star Trek in front of it but it's sure hell one of the best this year!!"

","I just came back from a showing of the movie (and I have a popcorn bucket to boot). And I must say that I'm impressed by it. It has Special effects better then the first and very close to anything that Pixar ever made (especially Wall-E and Up). The Action is Bigger with a capital 'B' and a huger cast of Robots. Not to mention Megatron and Starscream getting bigger roles (when comparing their appearance in this movie to the first, it makes it seem like they were just cameos in comparison).<br/><br/>But there are flaws abound. For example the jokes, while funny most of the time. Some of them were not really necessary to begin with.<br/><br/>There is a lot of sexual content in this film (including a pantie shot and *male* dogs humping each other). Not to mention the most creepiest thing of all: Devastator has (as Duke Nukem would say) BALLS of STEEL! (literally, I wish I was making this up. But it's true) Plus Wheelie (or Wheels, depending if you read the novelization) Dog humping a leg is a little creepy in itself.<br/><br/>Like I said at the top, the Action and the effects from Industreal Light & Magic (which make the first film's effects *also done by ILM* look like an over the top PS3 game in comparison *J/K, I still like them*) are saving graces and the hummer is pretty good for a Bay film. The Twins (i'm not sure when talking like Brooklyn people count as racialism, I'd just say stereotyping actually), Wheelie and Jetfire especially make the best of their time.<br/><br/>So do not give into what the critics have to say, just see it, you won't be too disappointed. But leave the kids at home."

Oh, and people running from explosions in slow motion. John Woo's action films seem to be in fast forward compared to this. Just because it is in slow mo it doesn't make it cool... unless you're Zack Snyder.<br/><br/>It is hard to imagine anyone enjoying this film on any level, even the recently lobotomised. From the previews and hype, Michael Bay appears to be trusting the success of this film on the marketable qualities of Megan Fox's heaving bosom. Yes, gratuitous close ups of her chest abound.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is a contemptible hack. He has single handedly set science fiction back a few years, undoing the good work done by the recent masterful science fiction films, up to and including Alien.

","Please excuse if there is any mistakes, my keypad is very unresponsive I am so sick of people saying "" there is no plot"" "" The twins are racial"" Thats bull. First of all, if people spent less time thinking up smart comments to make on this movie, they might actually realise that there is a very credible storyline. Second, in the first movie, Sam asks Optimus how they learnt to speak the way they speak, and Optimus replies, the World Wide Web. There is all manner of content on the internet. So the twins would have picked that up, unknowingly.<br/><br/>The problem is, that the very good storyline is buried deep within layer upon layer of action scenes. Don't get me wrong, the action scenes were fantastic and very enjoyable, but the story just wasn't bold enough, you didn't realise it. Apart from that I really can't think of any other major faults with this movie.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie twice now and i've thoroughly enjoyed it both times. The CGI was amazing.

","I have to admit, I went into this movie expecting the worse based on everyone's review that I have read. From IMDb.com to feedback from friends, I have been told it was too long, it had bad acting and wasn't worth it. <br/><br/>There was a fight towards the end that seemed to be a little too easy to win (I won't mention which fight or any other details to avoid spoilers), but outside of a few cheesy lines, I would say the movie was OK. It sure wasn't as good as the first movie, but wasn't THAT far off from it either. The music was fun, the special effects were fun, the many lines where they were obviously trying to be hip...at the most...were actually fun (or funny). <br/><br/>Someone in another review said there was too much special effects and too much Megan Fox showing her cleavage off....but hey!...sounds like a classic ""good"" movie to me! Sorry folks, but that kind of stuff sells and I don't think they crossed any lines or over played it. As for the effects....this is a CG-packed action movie with a dramatic revenge title...what else were you expecting? It sure isn't a romance. <br/><br/>I would say that this movie is not recommended for younger audiences since it does have a lot of profanity. Then again, with the ""hip"" approach to the use of language, I highly doubt its not something they already hear every day in school (regardless of grade). That's all up to the parents and how they want to expose or censor such. <br/><br/>To give them a little credit, I went ahead and gave the movie an 8 out of 10. Why? Because it made me feel that I got my money's worth, it was a great movie, I would watch it again, and I left with the feeling that I would want to see another sequel. The acting wasn't that bad, despite the few cheesy lines as I have already mentioned. <br/><br/>If you liked the first movie, I say go watch this one. One of the only things that didn't make this movie as good as the first one...is the fact that it lacks the element of surprise (aka ""its already been done once""). These kind of sequels almost always fall victim to fallacies and/or generalizations created by such."

","This is a great sequel that's just as awesome as the original, and highly lived up to my expectations! Everybody did an awesome job. The storyline seems a lot darker than the original. There is more comedy, emotional moments, and a lot more fighting. It's been two years since the Autobots helped Sam Witwicky defeat the Decepticons. As Sam leaves for college, he finds a piece of the Allspark, which causes him to see visions of Cybertronian symbols in his mind. Megatron is resurrected, and brings the Fallen to Earth, so they can finish what they started, and try to use the Matrix of Leadership to destroy the Sun. Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots must stop the Decepticons once again. I highly recommend TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN!!!"

","Transformers 2 is a full-blown attack on the senses. I left with a massive headache, sore eyes, ringing ears and a sense of disappointment I haven't felt since I finished the last Harry Potter book.<br/><br/>I never write reviews on IMDb.com but I just felt compelled to share with everyone what an epic fail I thought this movie was.<br/><br/>Forgive me if I miss some things as I have already forgotten most of it. Which makes me wonder... has Tranformers 2 caused my brain cells to shrivel up and die; or did I merely block that disturbing 4 billion hours from my memory. Anyhoo, let's carry on...<br/><br/>The movie starts and BAM! bad acting. Intense close-ups for some reason. Blah blah blah. Nothing of importance happens. Shia Lewhateverhisnameis goes to college. That's nice. Megan Fox looking sexy and oddly placed on motorbike. Even worse acting. Zero chemistry between Shia and Megan. Makes me cringe.<br/><br/>Shia's parents provide some sort of comic relief. Average acting, lame jokes and yet I can't help but appreciate the distraction from bad acting/non-existent plot. I almost laughed.<br/><br/>Oh okay, here are some robots now. Which ones are good again? Wait, were those robots in the other movie? So they're new. Okay, which ones are bad? Robots robots ROBOTS ROBOTS BOTORTAIJFHOADVFIUHBDFG.<br/><br/>Here comes army. Army guy from other movie is kinda cute. Who is that random army guy with strange accent?! He appears here and there but never does/says anything significant. Army angry about robots. President has some sort of opinion on the whole robot thing... can't remember what it is.<br/><br/>Hey everyone, let's go to the desert. Egypt that is. Oompa Loompa let's them into the country. No need to check your passports. Carry on. We are in desert now. Somehow contacting high ranking people in army. Hey look, it's Shia's parents. Awkward ""sad"" scene. Shia tells Dad and Mum to leave. Won't leave without him. Finally they leave. Shia tells Megan to leave. She says she won't leave without him. There is awkward pause. On to next scene! Oh... also robots and army fighting in desert. Destroying pyramids. Too much to handle. Megan Fox running. Boobs flailing. Perfect make-up. Always with her mouth open for some reason. Male friend enjoys her slow motion running.<br/><br/>After several hours robots stop fighting... someone seems to have won. Oh look, it's Optimus Prime. Didn't he die?! Aaaaaaaand cut.<br/><br/>I'm going to take some hard pain-killers and go to bed."

","CGI and sound all are top-notch, it's truly amazing what they can do today. It is horribly apparent, however, that the guys behind this think so too, and wants to make that abundantly clear by shoving 2h of it down your throat, non-stop. And the initial amazement turns into boredom and annoyance.<br/><br/>There is a laugh here and there, but other than that, what else makes up the movie is so extremely poorly done, there really isn't much movie here at all. It's like they started out creating action sequence after another with little or no respect to a story or plot, and then superglued it together with some subpar plot-fluff and poor acting. The movie is a near-complete hackjob.<br/><br/>In all sincerity, with respect to the much disliked director Uwe Boll's quarrel with Michael Bay, I actually believe that if Uwe were given the same resources truly WASTED on this movie, he would produce something similar or even better.<br/><br/>I also saw Steven Spielberg's name there somewhere.

"tedg","Null","39","74","16 July 2009"," Understanding Denied
","There are two things to look for in a film, at least for me.<br/><br/>One is whether it is important in the sense that it has life, matters, becomes part of you. This is rare, but so, so very valuable.<br/><br/>It becomes possible because film is hungry for ways of delivering that power, so it grabs weakminded filmmakers and forces them to extend cognitive boundaries and refine new visual grammars. That gives us the second kind of interesting film — where the project itself is worthless, but there is some clear new thing emerging that by itself makes the soul tingle with expectation over how it might be used by a real artist.<br/><br/>This and its previous version are such a movie. They contain something that I think is important. I mentioned it in the comment on the first one and can only repeat the observation here. We are seeing here the development of a visual style that is more than a style I think.<br/><br/>In an ordinary movie, the framing and staging is expository: you are shown what you need to see to make sense out of what is happening. If it is a boxing match with Sly Stallone, you see what is essential: you see perhaps the possibility, the actor, the action and the effect. Its all there, very carefully engineered. In fact, this engineering — a very constrained subset of what can be photographed — is what constitutes the contract we have in communicating visually.<br/><br/>What I first saw in ""Black Hawk Down"" was an engineering of what you do not see. Some of the action happened around us, the camera eye moving as if it were panicked and seeing only a part of what is going on. You could not make out the sense of what caused what. Because we so solidly expect to see everything that causes things, when we deviate it is a powerful statement.<br/><br/>What we have here are transformations and fights that are only partially framed. We are denied enough information to know precisely what is happening. We know there is an exact order to how the many parts fold into an automobile or plane, but we often see just motion. The effect is most pronounced in battle scenes when the viewer would be panicked in the motion and threat of war. Confusion and lack of comprehension is part of the effect. It isn't just random noise though; we know that though the screen is filled with scores of metal shapes apparently in chaos, they belong to two beings. We cannot sort out who is who. We know that within those beings, the animators have programmed coherent bodily motion. We know that each blow is basically like those of Stallone, but we do not know any of the physics behind it, or even which way it is going.<br/><br/>This is an amazing visual experience. I saw it in Imax. Sure, the film otherwise is ridiculous, and I find the cosmology troubling. But it is notable that while they go to extreme lengths to explain every point in the history of why these beings are here and why they fight, they go to equal trouble to keep the visual understanding of the fight from us.<br/><br/>I think this is something new, and I can't wait until it is used in a real film.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."

"TheHande","7","28","51","30 June 2009"," A well-paced action romp
","Transformers 2 succeeds in what every sequel should strive to achieve. The film is just as silly and entertaining as its predecessor. Sadly, it also falls victim to the obvious problem of sequels that follow their predecessors exactly, it doesn't manage to exceed or stand apart from its predecessor enough to be considered the better movie.<br/><br/>The film has a good structure and manages to pace action, (over) dramatic story-telling and comedy incredibly well. This is evidenced by the fact that while the movie is considerably longer than the first it doesn't feel like the movie is dragging on. The moments of levity and humorous voice-acting from the Transformers cast are what keep the film from becoming too monotonous to bare.<br/><br/>The film has its weaknesses though. Sometimes the comedy crosses the line between being appropriate and being just too much the focus of a scene. The action-scenes are still preposterously huge and difficult to follow. While we get to see new Autobots they are mostly kept to the sidelines and don't have a chance to show a lot of personality. The Decepticons are all gray in colour except the most humongous of them, and mainly they seem animal shaped for no apparent reason.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with the film is that it doesn't bring anything new to the mix. The cast is almost entirely the same. The novelty of the first film is now replaced with the story of the Decepticons arriving in Earth long before the two films' events. And despite all the fan outcry we still don't hear the Transformers Theme Song.<br/><br/>But in every area the film succeeds in mirroring its predecessor and is by all accounts a good movie if not a stand-out film."

Action is TOP notch, and the story is flows good, and sticks somewhat to the Transformers story. I went ans seen it on the opening night, and am going back to see it again on IMAX.

","I went into the showing of Transformers Revenge of the fallen with hight hopes, and i came out entertained, thrilled and wanting more of the action!<br/><br/>This film was 200 times better than the first Tranformers which was also my favourite film, but after Tranformers Revenge of the fallen the first film has been de-moated to 2nd.<br/><br/>The CGI was truly amazing, at times i forgot that they were computer generated. A vast improvement. It was also vastly better due to the fact that the Transformers appeared so much, unlike the first film in which they were more like Cameo's in this they where is most of the scenes. Unfortunately many of the new Autobots and Decepticons didn't get named, i only knew whop they were from finding out previously online. <br/><br/>Prior to the film, there was a lot of criticism about Skids and Mudflap's appearance because they appeared to be designed like Jar Jar Binks from star wars. I found that in the film, they actually stood out as key characters and were lovable characters. This is the same for Jetfire, who was criticised for looking to much like an old man. <br/><br/>Sam's parents, two of the humans i was really pleased to see again, both of whom played a bigger part in the film, and i am glad about this, i thought their roles really contributed to the film. This is the same for Simmons from the first film, as well as Major Lennox.<br/><br/>Apart from a few minor plot holes this has to be the best film i have ever watched. As soon as it is out i am going to be buying this on Blu Ray.<br/><br/>I Rate this 10/10 and would recommend it to everyone!"

Yes a few gross out scenes such as Tutorro's butt. The brownie scene is a little overdone. I did cringe a little at some scenes because I had two ten year old kids one male and one female with me.

","Not being hugely familiar with the whole Transformers franchise I can't give an entirely accurate opinion on keeping true to the comic/cartoon (this also made it hard for me to differentiate between some of the Autobots/Decepticons), however, I did enjoy the film. The special effects were convincing, the pace was fast, the characters were likable, the overall story was entertaining but did get difficult to follow in some places, the comedy was enough to keep the viewer interested and showed that it didn't have to be only action but it did get a bit tedious as if they were trying too hard at times. This taken into account you still felt on the edge of your seat when something serious/moving was going on. I personally felt slightly bored at some points during the movie with tired, used clichés such as ""I'm getting too old for this crap"" and the characters declaring their love to awaken each other from supposed death/and then when awoken from said suspected death. All this considered I don't regret going to see the film and would recommend it as the story and action saved it from a couple of trivial flaws."

This is probably the most action packed movie that I've seen since The Dark Knight. They used a fare bit of plot in the first Transformers. Don't get me wrong the first Transformers was better, but that's because they had the whole Autobot-Decepticon rivalry to explain which ads a lot to the plot. Also the acting is well done. There's a good balance between funny and serious. Going into the movie I was really hoping that they kept up the action from the first movie, and they did.

"tom_owens_182","8","22","39","18 May 2010"," Perfect for it's audience, everyone else hates it.
","Whilst usually I am not a fan of Michael Bay movies, with Pearl Harbour in my opinion being one of the worst films ever made, I have to say I started to think after watching the Transformers films. This was because of two factors: 1) I am an avid fan of the 80's TV show and, a result of this, watching it on the bigger screen was like being a kid again. Especially with Peter Cullen being the voice of Optimus Prime once more. I have to say that whilst the 1986 Transformers movie was much more faithful to the show, the 2007 movie did a damn good job of presenting the concept to a modern audience. I enjoyed the design of the robots (despite HUGE product placement from Chevrolet and Chrysler.) and overall the concept was clever enough and to top it off, it had a kick-ass soundtrack.<br/><br/>2) This conditions in which I saw the sequel. It was a perfect summer movie. I saw this film during the day, and then spent the rest of the day partying. It was perfect. Giant robots beating the sh*t out of each other. Could it get any more simpler? To those who criticise the film for having a vague plot, well did you ever watch the 80's TV show? That had no plot what so ever. It was dumb, loud and colourful (aside from the Decepticons). In other words, perfect for it's target audience. It was the same for this film. It provided a basic set of rules for people to follow. Good and bad robots. Fight. Explosion. Done. $800 million big ones.<br/><br/>One common complaint about this film is that it is a typical 'Michael Bay' movie. By this I mean it has all the classic trademarks, poor direction, explosions (oh so many explosions) weak plot lines and poor character development. Although this is a valid complaint, I felt it worked for this movie. Bravo for putting Transformers in the hands of the most crazy director in Hollywood. Having so many explosions and action scenes mean that I was never bored. And those moments when there was no action. Bay throws in Miss Fox to entertain the male half of the audience.<br/><br/>Although it may seem stupid and insulting to women. It is important to note that Michael Bay clearly knows his audience and so panders to them. He knew that the average summer movie goer wants to see some action, listen to some awesome music (provided by Linkin Park) and watch Megan Fox fixing motorcycles whilst bent over. I have to say that for 90% of the time men are respectful to women. But when your watching a film for escapism you just want to no be judged for thinking a certain way, you enjoy being free of judgement.<br/><br/>In conclusion, you can either love or hate this film. Love it if your in the right mindset and like simply being entertained. Or you can complain. Pick this movie to death because it that's truly what you want to do. In the time you do that, I'll watch Transformers 2 and love all the way through.<br/><br/>8/10"

The story rolls on and into Sam's personal life and is entertaining and funny. Bumblebee is once again a scene stealer. Sam's involvement in the Transformer's plight was carefully orchestrated and interesting. The only problem is, from where Sam leaves home it becomes a real Transformers story and those who are not hard core Transformers fans will complain. It transcends into an almost cartoon type story and I loved it, the entire background story, the Fallen and the history. The Constructicons and Devastator were amazing. The special effects are truly incredible. The story is a bit long and hard to take in at a first watch but it is a true Transformers story and should be given the thumbs up for giving us a much less a human story than the last one.

"hunnix","8","20","35","27 June 2009"," The saga continues
","To write a review in appreciation or attempted criticism which is always easier by the way of a movie such as Transformers wouldn't be fair at all if you haven't read the comics or followed the animated series. That the movie lacks depth of a story and of characters would also be the most often used remarks by critics. As I have neither read the comic nor watched the anime I will stick on to the first impressions of the movie that held me enraptured for a good length of time. I had watched the first transformers movie at home and was blown away by the unimaginable action content. I had wondered then how compelling the giant screen experience with surround sound would have been. I had immensely regretted having missed watching it in the theatre. It was with this two year long eager anticipation that I stepped into the theatre yesterday to catch in all the action. The theatre was packed with eager eyed impatient fans like me. The sonic transmission of the autobots through the opening titles was spine tingling. I couldn't have imagined a more exciting presentation than that. The movie follows through with Sam Witwicky heading off to college. He finds a shard of the AllSpark which leads to an essential part of the plot and the justification for all the nonstop, high flying, hair raising, breathtaking, jaw dropping action. The shard triggers Sam's mind and he starts seeing symbols which by the way are directions to the location of the Matrix, a powerful source of energy for transformers of all kinds- good ( autobots) and evil( Decepticons). It is a race to finding the Matrix before it falls into the wrong hands heralding the doom of Planet Earth. I must admit the plot was thick and in every bit riveting till the final cut. That each of the transformers has a background, and that forms various subplots in the movie was a revelation to me upon perusing the wikipages for the summary of the comics. It was an enlightening read and this is the point perhaps the movie fails at. Bay should have established the Decepticons well or perhaps shown us a little history to make us understand how they fit into the plot. The Decepticons looked all similar to the slow and unfocused eye only because there were two many of them on the same frame and the camera kept swinging back and forth in a hurry. Perhaps, Bay should have slowed down the action a bit for us to tell which was which. That said I can't stop raving about the sand sucking Devastator( upon a little researching on wiki to know which Decepticon this was- or is it a constructicon?) Which imaginative mind could have conceived such a scene? I am apparently still in a daze. Bay has carved a niche for himself with his unique storytelling through action and careful editing. Not one scene stretches longer than a minute. You need to take it all in as quickly as you can and if you can't keep up then stick to watching dramas. This is an Action movie and Bay does it best his way. I have some complaints though. Not to take anything away from the movie as remarkable as it seemed. But only wish Bay addresses them in the sequel to the sequel. 1) Why isn't there droolworthy content for the ladies? Shia is plain as paper we need a hotter replacement. 2) There was too much forced humor and that didn't go very well especially the Agent Simmons (Turturro) and Leo Spitz(Ramon Rodriguez) bits, the dogs and the tripping mom. 3) Why was Bumble Bee sidelined? He deserved more action. 4) Fox's heavily botoxed lips are scary to watch. 5) Could the Decepticons be made more discernible? <br/><br/>Transformers, has for me been the best answer to an explosive sci- fiction/ action flick and deserves a thunderous applause."

I was afraid that this film would flop; that one good one was good but the sequel would fail. Having watched the trailer I was feeling even less inclined to see it. Yet all the same I went to see it.<br/><br/>It was just as good if not better.<br/><br/>In no. 2 the characters have more room to grow. In the first one Megan fox's character is interesting, sexy but she does not really come across as that lovable or believable. However in the second she really shines out. Her character is much more really and has a great dimension to it. In the first one Mikaela is too 1-dimentional. In this one the love between her and Sam is very really and much more heart felt. Shia LaBeouf in the first one played the part of the slightly nerdy guy from school excellently. He was fantastic. In the second film he has grown up and is going to college. It is a new start for Sam and a new character. He is much more strong willed and defiant in the second.<br/><br/>The transformers themselves was a slight letdown; although there were many new characters the old ones did not get as large or as significant part as before. Iron hide comes up a few times yet Ratchet is not even mentioned. Bumblebee, Sam's guardian, has a less important role. Even Megatron, has a much smaller part. Really the film is about the Prime family and so about Optimus Prime. Prime in the first film was a powerful and good character. Yet he was slightly too opposed to battle and slightly too cheesy. In the second film that is gone. Prime's character is far more decisive and powerful. He has much more screen presence. Prime's main scene is defending Sam from the approaching Decepticons. Optimus gives his life in a hugely emotional and awesome scene. Prime takes on all the Decepticons at once. He is finally killed by Megatron yet the fight is worth the entire film.<br/><br/>I recommend this film to all and those who have had second thoughts about it, SEE IT!!"
"Robert_duder","8","18","31","23 August 2009"," A sequel was a must but it was just a step too far
","This was probably my most anticipated film of the summer season so expectations were definitely high. The first film was mind blowing action and launch the opportunity for an incredible series of films. I think in part legendary action director and producer Michael Bay has a very specific recipe for action that seems to always work so in his mind the ultimate sequel would simply be more of everything that made the first installment incredible and that doesn't necessarily make for the perfect follow up. Plus I think the first Transformers was so stunning because for the first time ever you were seeing the legendary toy/cartoon characters in larger than life reality but now the novelty of that has worn off. Transformers 2 is still great, loads of fun, some incredible battles, familiar characters and a welcome sequel but indeed does not surpass or really even touch the original film. The biggest probably with the film, and I've heard this voiced by other critics, is that there are just SO MANY robots. Most of the time you have no idea who is who rather than keeping to the core group. The only Transformer I could pinpoint at any one time was Optimus Prime, even Megatron blended with some of the others.<br/><br/>Hollywood It guy Shia LaBeouf returns to his heroic role as Sam Witwicky. I had thought that maybe the movie creators would give LaBeouf a little more character than the first time around but they basically keep him at the same level as the first one. Still he fits the film very well and he is as good as he was in the original and that is okay for the role. Megan Fox returns again and her role is even less than it was in the first film. I have no doubt that Fox's purpose in this film was to drive red blooded males crazy and she does that with ease but her character is mostly quite vapid. The decent chemistry between her and LaBeouf is barely there any more and she has to share her sexy status with another female this time around. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also return in a slightly larger role. Both of them are great and I wish they had more screen time as the heroes of the film. John Turturro turned in a very quirky love/hate character in the first film but his return in this installment felt forced and was part of the unnecessary over done comedy that plagued this installment. Isabel Lucas gives Fox a run for her money both for Witwicky's affections and sex symbol for the film. Lucas gets a great bad-ass role and is a killer to the bone making for a great foe to the team.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's success comes from the over the top action that leaves you on the edge of your seat, explosions, battles, and the perfect mix of serious adrenaline and witty sharp sarcastic comedy. Unfortunately the overwhelming slapstick comedy is kind of overbearing in Revenge of the Fallen. Sam's parents who return from the first one are cute and funny but they are way overused unlike the first film. The mother played by Julie White is bordering on obnoxious and then they actually make her get drunk...ugh. One of the most stunning things to see in this film is the creation of the incredible Devastator. Unfortunately he goes down pretty quick but it is something to see. Also the addition of a higher up to Megatron could have been left out. In the first film Megatron was like a Transformer god and after being resurrected again in this film it almost feels like he is barely a threat as Optimus Prime rips through him like nothing. With a film like this there will ALWAYS be complaints and I am not trying to downplay it because it absolutely is worth seeing and there are some really terrific scenes but it overloads the things that made this film series incredible. Hopefully for the third part they will make a few changes to make the end of this trilogy truly mind blowing. 8.5/10"

","Well, first things first. Plot-wise, movie sucks. The only minor part.<br/><br/>Now to the main course. This movie is a clear block buster winner. Much better than the first one. Big Robots. Big Action scenes. Very funny comedy scenes. The acting was much better than the first one. Excellent and amazing special effects and animations. Nice cinematography. Very good music score too. Very well paced. Action, comedy and tragedy was evenly proportioned.<br/><br/>This is a movie to be watched on bigger screen. Don't wait till the DVD comes out (though it's definitely coming to my DVD collection). Don't go with expectations like there's a big plot behind it. It's a summer movie. It's a hang with your friends, eat popcorn, drink sodas and have fun kinda movie. I was laughing my a** of in this one and momentarily stunned by the action sequences. I... I in fact enjoyed it a lot. It was fun to watch. That's the whole point of a movie. To have fun and it certainly lives up-to it.<br/><br/>In short, it's an awesome, f*****g mind blowing movie.<br/><br/>I give it a 8.3/10..."
"knopfler-1","1","72","148","28 June 2009"," Sigh
","First Transformers movie: Great, fun, decent story & characters, fairly faithful to the original series. Not perfect but Michael Bay did a great job. Much better than expected.<br/><br/>Second Transformers movie: Ummm....whoever was restraining Michael Bay from his usual self, can we have them back please? Perhaps Spielberg had a lesser influence in this movie than the first. I don't know but what I do know is that this is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen (It's a close call between this & Shrek 3). <br/><br/>The good: - Ummm.....I guess I can say that the amount of effort the special effects guys put in was very impressive. I seriously can't think of a redeeming feature.<br/><br/>The bad: - Racist stereotypes - Objectification - No plot - What characterization there was in the first is all but gone. - TWO jar-jars - There are now Terminators in Transformers? Huh? - ugh....i can't write anymore. It's too depressing."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","16","27","6 May 2011"," Still didn't transformed me into a Transformers fan.
","Actually I'm a person that is always quite fond of Michael Bay movies. I like how he brings some overblown action entertainment to the screen with basically all of his movies. His Transformers movies however have never really appealed to me.<br/><br/>But having said that, I actually have to admit that I liked this movie better than the first. It seems like they learned from some of their mistakes of the first movie, which also makes me somewhat more hopeful for the third movie ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"". If they improve even more, the movie could actually turn out to be quite good, as well as entertaining.<br/><br/>Cause by saying I liked this movie better than the first one, I'm not saying at all that this is being a very good movie. It's entertaining enough to watch but that is it really. Everything about it is quite bad and simplistic but I'm of course not talking about the special effects though.<br/><br/>The special effects are basically what Bay's Transformers movies are being known for. They are top of the bill and with each movie they keep pushing to the limits of what's possible and come up with new unseen stuff. They are innovative movies special effects wise and that's also why I often enjoy watching a Michael Bay movie; they are big budget ones but you can always see the budget back on the screen. Not only with its computer effects but also all of its action in general.<br/><br/>And yes, there obviously is plenty of action in this movie. But too much though in my opinion. At times the movie is really nothing more than the one big action sequences after the other, which quite frankly can get tiresome to watch. After a while you stop caring what is happening, also because you often don't even understand what is going on. Not because the story is hard to follow but just because of the way the movie got shot and told. The movie is definitely too long as well, also because the last hour or so is being like one big action piece, that could had wrapped up things far sooner.<br/><br/>But strangely enough the reason why I still liked this movie better than the first one was its story. This actually might sound strange because this movie its pre-production really suffered from the writer's strike. The story had to be finished in a hurry, while Michael Bay had already come up with some big action sequences to write a story around, connecting them all. So by all means, the story shouldn't work but it just all felt less random this time. Maybe it was a good thing that they had to come up with things in an hurry because when having more time, you also have more time to come up with lots of other crazy action stuff, like perhaps was what happened and was the problem with the script of the first movie.<br/><br/>Also all of the characters worked out better this time around. Lots of characters and actors from the first movie return in this one and the movie seems to have found a better balance between their sequence and the ones featuring the Autobots and Decepticons.<br/><br/>An entertaining enough overblown movie to watch but by no means a great one.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"sa-178","8","29","54","24 June 2009"," This is what a summer movie is all about!
","Transformers 2 is what a summer movie is all about : big, loud and above all, a sumptuous feast for the senses! For those who whine about the plot (or lack of) and acting, you should stay at home and watch Turner Classics.<br/><br/>This is everything one can ask for and more. The production team has done just about everything to satisfy the hard-core Transformer faithful and the lay followers of the story.<br/><br/>My only gripe is the relatively quick and cheap destruction of Devastator and The Fallen. Isn't Devastor one of the biggest meanest SOB-of a Decepticon? For Devastor to be felled by a rail gun is an insult to the character. As for The Fallen, you'd expect the final fight against Optimus Prime to be monumental. Alas it wasn't so.<br/><br/>Well, there's always Transformers 3."
"TomCruiseFan99","5","70","144","29 June 2009"," Just average. Altho its better with a 2nd viewing. First viewing I thought it was crap!
","First, let me start by saying I went to see this on Friday night here in South Africa. And left the cinema absolutely gobsmacked at how terrible it was. Then the next morning my 10 year old niece wanted to watch it and her parents weren't willing to sit thru it and neither was I but they offered to pay for my service to accompany my niece and so I gave in and was willing to put myself thru it all again.<br/><br/>And I'm glad I did, I actually managed to enjoy it the 2nd time around. Probably because I knew the bad points and they weren't gonna catch me by surprise. I must admit my expectations were quite high the Friday night, but once I knew what to expect it wasn't all that bad.<br/><br/>The fight scenes, I personally thought were much more ""watchable"" than the first movie. A lot more slo-mo punches and such made it a bit easier to see just what exactly was happening. And of course, the special effects and general mayhem was literally out of this world. There were quite a few ""fun"" moments that made you laugh.<br/><br/>And I don't understand the whole hullabaloo about the twinbots signifying racism. I thought they were funny, and it never occurred to me that they were based on black stereotypes. By the way, I'm black.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, there were quite a few points that need addressing when part 3 comes around. Most notable, unnecessary characters that do little-to-nothing to advance the story. And speaking of the ""story"" - a little more sense could help. I know its a "" fun summer movie"" but it didn't need to be a ""dumb fun summer movie"". The plot could have used a bit of tweaking.<br/><br/>And the excuse that ""nobody comes to these movies for plot development, they just wanna see robots fighting"" makes no sense. Then they might as well have just had a 2 hour tag team WWE match-up in the desert quarry.<br/><br/>Still I have to say it's worth a watch, although it could have been so much better."
"steve_27156","9","36","69","26 June 2009"," One of those epic action movies
","Long anticipation for this sequel is paid off. This movie is seriously epic if you love action. People are always complaining about plots and the humors put into the movie. Seriously if you expect to get interesting plot, don't watch this. This is purely action movie on its base, you can go watch The Dark Knight or Eagleeye if you want interesting plot. The length 2 and a half hours have tons of action and the battles really pull you into the movie. The comedies also acceptable, at least the whole cinema laughed when they're shown. I really don't understand why people complaining with the amount of explosions. What are expected when missiles are shot? Fireworks? You hit robots with tanks and you expect water splash? Explosions are there because they all are using weapons!!<br/><br/>There are some weaknesses as well, nothing is perfect anyway. Some characters are being different compared to the previous. Some parts of the movie are weird without clear explanation of their background. The battles are fast paced and hard to differ between Autobots and Decepticons. But they are not big deals since the actions can cover those weaknesses.<br/><br/>If you want to see full packed action movie and getting entertained on your weekend, I recommend to watch this movie. If you want to see movie with interesting plot, then forget it, you won't get it in this movie.<br/><br/>For action based movie, I would give it 9/10 Two thumbs up!!"

"crazymetalheadbastard","10","28","52","2 February 2010"," I think it is one of My favourite Movies!!!
","People have their own opinions on different movies and I liked Transformer: Revenge of the Fallen. I even bought it on DVD the other day and have watched it a couple time. I like the action, explosions, the sounds and the characters and the adventure they are on. People say it is the worst movie of the year, even though if you look into 2009 their were a lot worse movies. This is however my opinion. I didn't like The Blind Side and it is because it is not my type of entertainment. That is why award shows suck because it makes it seem like everyone agrees on the same thing. I don't even want to see half of the movies that are up for the best picture awards at the Oscars. In my opinion Michael Bay is a great director and I like a lot of his movies. Shia Labeouf in my opinion is the greatest young actor out there right now. I thought Megan Fox is a fine actress and Julie White is very funny. The tranformers are awesome and my favourite characters of all time. I can't wait for Transformers 3 to come out. I will be there the day it comes out in theatres. Also, the soundtracks for these Transformer movies are the greatest."
"PrincesssTwinkie","10","28","52","24 June 2009"," A thousand times better than the original!
","I had the pleasure of seeing this at midnight in IMAX. I have to say it kicked the originals ass about 10,0000 times. It had everything the original had: great acting by the same actors, amazing special effects, same great robots. There were other things the original had but were bettered by this one: the score by the amazing Steve Jablonsky, more humor, an amazing soundtrack by various artists (namely Linkin Park's New Divide, which was worked into the score), and new robots. Do not listen to those who are complaining about it just because it was 2 and a half hours long. You will wish it would never end. An amazing plot, great characters, and the same lovable Autobots plus some new funny ones, and the same old evil Decepticons. It is the original, only better!!! A million times better!!! And a recommendation: see it in IMAX"
"brian-corish","9","106","226","17 June 2009"," Absolutely Fantastic
","I'm just back from a preview screening of this, and I am genuinely baffled as to where the bad reviews came from. This Movie is by a long stretch the best Block Buster of the Summer. It is superior to the very good original in almost every way. Michael Bay does a fantastic job of building suspense throughout the Movie to the extent that by the time the final battle comes you are literally on the edge of your seat. Anybody who I spoke to after said they thoroughly enjoyed it, some went so far as to say it was as good as the Dark Knight (not quite in my opinion), which should go some way to explaining how enjoyable this Movie is. It is everything a Summer Blockbuster should be, Big, Loud (fantastic sound mix too) simple, and fun."
"JapanGaijin","9","35","67","19 June 2009"," Fantastic Entertainment for Entertainment Lovers
","Out of all of the movies due to come out this summer. This one and G.I. Joe are the ones that I decided to make it a point to see on the day of release and even reserve my seat well in advance to feel like I'm right smack in the middle of it.<br/><br/>This Transformers, compared to the first one, was geared a lot more towards action and less storyline kind of like Matrix 2 compared to 1. A lot of reviewers are griping about Megan Fox's weak acting but I didn't go into the movie expecting Oscar-worthy performances. I came into this one expecting to be entertained.<br/><br/>The Special Effects in this one are mind-blowing. When I left the theater I was still in awe on how long we have come in the movie World with visual effects. I just think about the geniuses that it takes to put a movie like this together.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the comedy in the movie. John Turturro was a perfect addition to the movie and he was funny every step of the way. I like the twin robots speaking like some Mid-90s hip-hip MC's. The parents are hilarious too.<br/><br/>I am giving this movie a 9/10. It gets a 10/10 on an entertainment level but the 9/10 is for the storyline and a little confusion here and there."
"jonathanjameskelly","5","76","158","24 June 2009"," More of the same.......just a bit longer and more boring.
","First off let me say that I went to watch this movie on my own as my girlfriend told me in no uncertain terms that she would not go see it. And boy am I glad she wasn't there. If she had have been I would not have made to the end of the movie. All that kept me in my seat for 2.5 hours was the fact that I paid good money to see it and I hate not getting my money's worth! The slightest encouragement from anybody else to walk out before the end and I would have done so. Now onto the review......<br/><br/>As I sat in my seat watching the trailer for G.I. Joe for what must be the 100th time I realised I remember very little about the first Transformers movie. I remember the first time Sam sees his car transform, the Autobots trying to hide in Sam's back yard, Megan Fox's ass and breasts and Autobots saying things like ""My Bad"". I honestly couldn't tell you how it ended but I do know the good guys won.<br/><br/>With that in mind my expectations for Transformers 2 were for a fun, brain-dead action movie featuring plenty of gratuitous Megan Fox shots, horrible dialog, lots of explosions and plenty of obnoxiousness from the director, Michael Bay. The result??? It delivers all of that! Well except the fun part. The overlong running time sucks whatever fun there is to be had out of the movie and instead just makes it pretty boring.<br/><br/>What Michael Bay has done with this movie is to take what was good and bad about the first one and basically give you more of it. We some some robots last time, we see loads more this time. We see Sam and Mikaela running from Decepticons in the first movie, you see much more running this time. Last time we had robots peeing and saying ""My Bad"", this time we have robots crying, farting and even see some swinging robot testicles. I'm not kidding about that last one! Don't even get me started about the new racial stereotype Autobots, dogs humping or Sam's Mom tripping out on hash cakes.<br/><br/>But, look, we all know what you get when you go see a Michael Bay movie. We know he can't direct dialogue, we know he's not big on story, we know he'll put in random bits of crazy that make no sense. The fact is you put up with that to watch some great action sequences! And in the end there is maybe 30 minutes of quiet time in this movie and then a 2 hour action sequence with more robots and explosions than has even been seen. There was so much money thrown at this movie it almost makes me angry that it exists in the current economic climate. Every scene seems to have a special effect in it. Which brings me on to what Bay is all about, action and special effects. How are they? Good, not great, and I'll explain why. There are some fantastic set pieces and crazy robot transformations, fights, etc. I'm sure to those in the SFX business there was some great work done here. It's just hard for me as a moviegoer to care. The robot transformations are not very exciting, we've seen it before. The robot fights were over-long and confusing, it's hard to pick out an Autobot from a Decepticon most of the time. And all of the time the robots looked like a digital effect and never seemed to fit in with the live action background which brought me out of the movie at times. I loved in the first Jurassic Park how there was a mixture between digital effects and practical effects. Sometimes you had to wonder if you were looking at something real or computer generated. Eventually you just accepted what you saw and immersed yourself in the story. It was the same for Benjamin Button, it's hard to know that for 52 minutes Brad Pitt was only a computer generated head. With Transformers you know 100% of the time it's a digital effect. I know there is no getting around that as you can't build working Transformers but Bay could be more subtle with the action so as not to over-saturate the viewer. But that's not his way.<br/><br/>As for the physical action sequences, after the first 100 explosions it's hard to care about the next 500. We also get to see almost every weapon available in modern warfare, planes, tanks, submarines, helicopters, guns, cannons, lasers etc. There's so much of it it really is boring.<br/><br/>The storyline is average, the acting, what little there is of it, is nothing special and most disappointing is the fact that the Autobots seem to take a secondary role to Sam for the entire movie.<br/><br/>So in the end there is nothing really to like about this movie. If you like explosions and computer generated robots than you may enjoy yourself, but after 2.5 hours of it even a Michael Bay enthusiast would have had enough. The only consolation is that 24 hours after you've seen the movie you won't remember most of it and live the rest of your life in blissful ignorance."
"aortiz22","10","27","50","24 June 2009"," you know a movie is awesome when your girlfriend who hates action movies loved it.
","I just read through some of these comments and I've noticed that there are two types of people; those looking for an epic story centering on one man's quest to save the world while he realizes his love for his girlfriend. Also some robots are in it, and the fans that grew up with the cartoon and the toys, who say ""hey, this movie needs to do two things, look amazing and tell a cool story that will entertain me for two and a half hours."" I'm personally in the later side I loved the flick, hell I'll probably see it again, the CG effects were awesome, the acting was good and funny, and I had to time my leaving the theater just right to use the restroom so I wouldn't miss much. It did exactly what a movie is supposed to do, entertain and thrill. If you're looking for a movie with deep philosophical or some hidden meaning, go watch something else. I mean you know a movie is awesome when your girlfriend who hates action movies loved it."

","The scenario is more or less passable, the acting is basically the same as in the first Transformers movie, there are some ridiculous moments and some errors in geographical locations where the action takes place.<br/><br/>But the thing is that when you see the fights of Autobots and Decepticons in this movie, your jaw will drop and stay that way for two and a half hours until you see the end credits. Any real fan of the original Transformers was waiting to see this on a big screen - a full scale war between the large robots that hasn't been really delivered in the first movie.<br/><br/>There are so many new Transformers around this time, they fight and destroy each other in unbelievably detailed battles from the beginning till the end of the movie. If you really like the franchise, this is the one film to watch: it's as if the Michael Bay and producers have heard the fans and did everything to make the movie for them. Can't wait to see the next Transformers movie."

Even the Dark Night which was loved by critics couldn't even get nominated for best picture then for those same people to come after this movie is sheer stupidity. Again: giant robots, more giant robots, and more giant robots. It is a movie for someone to go and get away from reality. A movie where your imagination can run wild.

"filmpoetfourlife","9","34","65","21 June 2009"," As expected and just as AMAZING!!!
","After watching this film I realized I got exactly what I expected. Bay gave me sex appeal, he gave me hard rock music, and he gave me intense action, and oh boy was it magnificent. This isn't a psychological thriller or some tear jerker. This is the kick-ass movie you go into knowing exactly what to expect, and yet again I was anything but disappointed!!! The Autobots are just as hysterical and charismatic as in the first movie, and the deceptacons are more evil than ever.<br/><br/>Movies like these do their job perfectly. They let you enter into a state of imagination where the impossible becomes possible and the stressful becomes enjoyable. Once again Bay's mixture of special effects and not overly used CGI meshes perfectly well together.<br/><br/>I'd like to say thank you to Michael Bay for creating enjoyment twice in a row, something many directors can't do. I'd also like to say amazing job, in the behind the scenes sense, to such producers as Lorenzo DI Bonaventura and Mark Vahradian for helping put such a great film together. It is pretty obvious that a great amount of time was spent making this movie from start to finish."

I bought tickets and popcorn to see the movie, and it's awesome.<br/><br/>This is just as good as the original, with stunning CGI effects, great screenplay, and fantastic action sequences. <br/><br/>The story is hard to explain, so I won't get into more detail. The cast members came back in this, like Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox, and the Transformers like the Autobots (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, etc, and let's not forget about the Decepticons, (Megatron, Starscream, Devastator, Blackout, etc.) <br/><br/>Another ""must see"" movie and a ""must buy"" DVD or Blu-ray if you haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>The climax scene where they battle in Egypt was epic, almost close to the original climax scene where they battle in the city doing all sorts of destruction.<br/><br/>The one thing that really gets me into a bad situation, it was nominated and won by the stupid Golden Raspberry Awards!!! And it won Worst Picture, shame on you!!!!! I wish Old Dogs or All About Steve should of won that award, instead, they had to pick this movie for the worst, Why? With Avatar nominated for Best Picture (Lost to The Hurt Locker) and this movie nominated and won for Worst Picture. Two great movies, but opposite award shows.

"canerbey","8","26","48","3 July 2009"," This is a Transformers movie!
","I mean, come on! This is a Transformers movie. It's a million-dollar, technologically high end product of Hollywood. What do you expect? A perfect story? Revolutionary film techniques? Expert use of camera? This is not 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's a Hollywood movie and if you go and watch this movie, you should be expecting Transformers fighting each other, loads of explosion and stuff, and entertainment. You can't complain like ""there are too much robots."" Of course, you idiot, this is a robot movie. If you go and watch this movie and complain about too much robots, then you are in the wrong theater buddy. Transformers 2: The Revenge of the Fallen is a great action movie. I went to see my childhood heroes and villains beat the hell each other and firing at each other with super-duper weapons, guessing what will come out in the end from the start. I watched this movie to be entertained, to see my Transformers toys come to life, to see Optimus Prime in all his glory and I got what I went for. The rest is detail. After watching the first movie, I was really disappointed by the visual errors or extensive using of sponsors or unnecessary scenes. This one is an entertaining piece with all the support from Hollywood and that's it."
"AgentSands82","8","26","48","24 June 2009"," Amazing movie if only slightly flawed
","Let me start out by saying: Wow. Just... wow. The action in this movie is amazing. The plot for the most part stood on it's own, but let's be honest: you're here to see robots kick the crap out of each other. Transformers 2 delivers this by the truckload (no pun intended.) The fight scenes were incredible, to the point where I turned to my girlfriend at least 20 times to say ""This is badass!"" The action was nothing short of breathtaking, and I love the fact that the Autobots could actually hold their own this time (no more 3 Autobots and the Army struggling against a single Decepticon here). However, there were a few cheesy moments, clichÃ©d characters, lame one-liners that I felt detracted from the movie. And the ending was not satisfying at all. I don't want to give too much away, but I will say that it felt too ""easy"". It felt like the writer got lazy and just wanted to finish it.<br/><br/>Minor flaws aside, I loved this movie, and will be seeing it again, then buying the DVD and watching it again. The fight scenes were AMAZING, and for a popcorn flick it definitely hits more than it misses. See this movie!!<br/><br/>Edit: After reading a lot of the comments and seeing the negative ones, I kind of get the feeling that a lot of people were a) expecting Transformers 2 to be the next Shawshank Redemption or b) just plain hate Michael Bay and therefore anything he does. This was SUPPOSED to be mindless and over the top. I'm not a fanboy, you're entitled to your own opinion, but when someone compares Transformers 2 to Goodfellas, it's clear that some people just love to hate this movie."
"angel-quebrado","3","57","116","28 June 2009"," Disappointed.....
","Fist we'll go with the good points....the effects were smashing and the fight sequences fabulous! I even enjoyed that they forefronted a few of the lesser 'bots from the old series.<br/><br/>What I hated: (1) The fact that the language was so foul through most of the movie was absurd. No it's not a family film but all the language made it sound like a low IQ high schooler was practicing newly discovered vocabulary since mum and dad weren't around. Uncalled for and not helpful to the scenes at all. (2) Why in the world did they make StarScream into such a whiny weasel?! (3) So many abbreviated plot lines all crammed into a it made it seem drawn out and tedious. Very reminiscent of Spider Man Three. (4) The forced comedic scenes and ribald jokes were absolutely painful. (5) Was it just me or did the original Primes look a lot like LOTR's Sauron's helmet? Okay, so overall I wished I had just waiting to buy the DVD and watch it at home, sans kids."
"billeh98","1","61","125","29 June 2009"," One of the worst movies I've seen...
","Okay, for starters. I thought the first Transformers was decent enough with great effects but enough of a story and character development that it helped make those action scenes much more exciting because you gave a crap about what would happen to the characters.<br/><br/>Michael Bay was obviously given too much control of this one. Now, I read many people who somehow give this movie a 10 out of 10 or something up there with comments like best summer movie or I don't get the harsh reviews. Also, many people have said things like ""Because people didn't get an Oscar winning story they hated the movie but the fight scenes were awesome!""....NO! An Oscar winning story is not needed but some kind of story would be great. It felt as though Michael Bay just rushed through everything in order to get to the next action scene. I went in with low expectations and I still left disappointed. You'll notice every time there is plot development Michael Bay has his actors stand face to face while he swings the camera around them for 30 seconds and hopes that everything is explained in a nice little package.<br/><br/>Now, I don't expect much of a story from this movie as I stated, but this movie made absolutely no sense. At least 9 or 10 times myself or people I was with said ""What?"" or ""Huh?"" after a scene ended that was supposed to expand the story. The characters in this movie (robot or human) have no development and as such you could care less what their goals are or if they die. Let's just say everyone seems to manage to die and just come back to life (through memories, a piece of rock, or a meeting in the afterlife with the ""Prime Gods"" and love...I'm serious). So many robots just show up and do nothing in this movie and Shia just runs away from stuff in slow motion and Ms. Fox looks amazing but her acting...ouch. The love scenes with her and Shia are so unnatural and just painful to watch (I'm talking Anakin/Padme stuff).<br/><br/>The editing was atrocious. I remember at one point the Terminator Decipticon going after Shia was walking then it cuts to Meghan Fox saying she's coming over on a plane, then the Terminator girl in slow mo, then a plane taking off in slow mo, and then somehow Meghan Fox travels across the country in seconds. Them just happening to go to Egypt when they need to is convenient too. Oh, the comedy in this movie was horrid. The roommate, the parents, the dogs going at it, the leg scene with the small bot and Meghan Fox, the rear man thong shot, the racist gold toothed duo...just ridiculous. Jar Jar can now rest in peace.<br/><br/>Honestly, I left this movie angry. It wasn't even so bad that it was good. The action scenes were just explosions or shaky cam with all these similar looking robots rolling around and you have no clue what's happening again. If anything you might want to join the US army because this movie just felt like a huge ad to join them. Transformers fans might dig the action but everyone else is left without any background info on anything or anyone. Considering the budget and franchise and names behind this...I expected bad...but not one of the worst things ever."
"Asuka_Langley","8","38","74","30 June 2009"," It comes down to this...You are watching Transformers.
","As a huge Transformers cartoon fan and awesomely enchanted by the first movie I went to see T2 without second thoughts. What I saw in this 145 minutes movie is all I ever wanted to see...Pure transformers. This time special FX are improved and you get to see whats happening when Autobots and Decepticons are fighting. The movie score is similar to the previous one but can't help to say that Steve Jablonsky did an awesome job. The movie has its pro's and con's but con's don't have such a huge impact as many people believe. Firstly let me address this, Of course and we don't see many human dialog in the movie..your are watching transformers. Second, you don't get to see many autobots but I believe that Bumblebee and Jetfire even the little guy or the twins steal the show. Now for real life cast, Hotie Fox is just another decoration in the movie without adding nothing to the story. Sam from the other hand is still the same character you've saw in the first movie which of coarse is good. To all the Bay haters out there and to culture geeks, this movie is not about realism or have a deeper meaning hidden inside, this movie is all about...the same thing that made us love the cartoon series and... ""To all the fans out there, hidden among the stars, the movie is pure awesomeness, you have to watch it"""
"g-bodyl","9","25","46","11 February 2011"," Why Is This Hated So Much?
","I can't believe some of the reviews I read for this movie. People trash this movie so much because it makes an attempt at humor. I admit it wasn't the best but it still got some laughs out of me. Everything is just perfect for a summer blockbuster. Maybe that's another reason why people hate this.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky continues his alliance with the robots two years after the original events. As usual he and his robots are out to save the world from invasion.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. Shia is a pretty good action star. Megan Fox is hot as usual. John Turturro provided some more neat comic relief.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great blockbuster. It also has plenty of action and great special effects. I rate this film 9/10."
"jpach31","10","25","46","25 June 2009"," Bay/Spielberg At Their Finest
","OMG!!! OMG !!! OMG !!!! THE BEST BAY/Spielberg MOVIE TO DATE!!!! I have to give Michael and Steven their props. Of all the years, that I have seen Steven at work behind the camera for all his movies. This one outranks them all (including Indiana Jones). I have never seen such artistry come to life. I felt like I was standing right there beside Shia, being his partner and fighting the Decepticons. It was truly an amazing ride. I saw the first movie, but this one out-did the first Transformers movie. I hope that there will be a third movie. There has to be, they can't just leave us hanging on. But I do have to say this, Shia Lebouef has come along way since his Disney days on Even Stevens, now he is the new face in town and every boy is going to want to be just like him to save the day."
"TheAdvocator","10","32","61","21 October 2009"," Lacks the heart of the original but still delivers on journey of characters.
","There has been much criticism about the movie being confusing and nothing but crude humor but there is more than that in this film. As a sequel the writers have developed plot lines for the human characters that give them an opportunity to grow as opposed to simply running away from evil Decepticons. Shia's character is asked by his colleague to help win a war and instead runs away from duty. When more people wanted action they got that as well as more character development than a typical sci-fi blockbuster.<br/><br/>Sam and Mikela's relationship is explored further in this second installment and it delivers on what it promises. This and more is plentiful through out the movie. However more Autobot character development would have been a welcome addition to the movie, but this can be attributed to the writer's strike and the staff not having enough time to contribute to what a portion of the fan base wants. Let's hope we get more character development all around in the third installment."
"ladyadidas101","10","32","61","24 June 2009"," Awesome movie!!...
","If your expectations are right. People are ragging on this movie because they're expecting too much...the fatal blow to many a great film. But if you take it as it is: an action flick with tons of cgi action, explosions, and Shia running around screaming (and looking awesome as he does it) then you will be pleased.<br/><br/>There were plenty of humorous moments complete with silly jokes and physical comedy. It was a nice break from all of the mass explosions and destruction. Funniest parts of the movie involved the dialogue given to the ""Twins"". Some of the things they said were so ridiculous that you couldn't help but laugh.<br/><br/>Overall...quite enjoyable :)"
"Jonnhy08","10","24","44","26 January 2010"," The most impressive movie in years
","Is incredible how the effects are even more beautiful. More one time ''Industrial Light and Magic'' make her best. The scenes are great, more than the 2007's Transformers - other of my favorite movies. The history is good, the comedy is crazy, the actors don't fail much, some cool surprises and i want see this movie again and again. I expect the third more emotional, with more characters development too. But had to be spectacular like this one. Michael Bay has your fails, but i like of his movies, because remember how fun the movies may be. I don't know much of Transformers before the first one, and now i like so much of this characters, humans or robots... MORE TRANSFORMERS SOON."
"bartendammo","8","31","59","30 June 2009"," Chill out and enjoy!
","Anybody who takes this movie too seriously should just chill out and enjoy it for what it is. It takes a really cool concept and amps up the action as far as it can go and gives you a lot of laughs along the way. There is an extremely hot actress and good music in the soundtrack and the guy who voices Optimus Prime is worth the price of admission alone. People who say Megan Fox or Shia Lebouf are not good actors are just jealous lamebrains. And although I think somebody else would have been a better choice for a subject as daunting as Pearl Harbor, Michael Bay is perfect for something like Transformers. When all is said and done people will watch this more in their lifetime than most of the other crap out there because it is really well done escapist comedy action. If you've had a bad day and need to relax, popping in a DVD or Blu-Ray of either Transformers movie will help you escape and relax because it is just pure fun."
"FlyingHitman","10","31","59","24 June 2009"," One Word:; AWESOME
","I really cannot understand the negative reviews by so many people. I don't know what they expected, but I for one got what I hoped for: A really funny movie with lots of action and special effects as good as it gets, at least for now. One unbelievable hot Megan Fox for the cherry on the cake.<br/><br/>If you expect this movie to have actor performances or a storyline that would win an Oscar, you will not enjoy this movie. This is just perfect action cinema with a lot of humor.<br/><br/>I really think it is a little bit better than part one and I would usually say you'll enjoy this movie, IF you enjoyed part one."
"bassnut101","9","31","59","21 June 2009"," Stunning and fun!!
","This sequel is a brilliant action film. OK so the plots as thin as Megan Fox's character but its transformers......hello!!! Since when does it need a real twisting plot. Its good against evil, what more do you want? And lets face it, all the real fans want to see is transformers changing from one thing to another, fighting their battles and Megan fox's booty!! At least that what the survey said (true fact) Anyways, the film has action all the way through it, some humour and some touching scenes thrown in. Just the right balance of each in my opinion. This film will split decisions between many people but if you take it for what it is, i'm sure most people will love it.<br/><br/>Its bigger, louder and longer than the first. This years summer smash bar none!! I thought Terminator Salvation would be the big hit but trust me, this will smash it to pieces!! Two and a half hours best spent watching the big screen and you REALLY got to see it on the big screen."
"HubbaBoba","10","30","57","20 June 2009"," What is everyone on about?!
","It seems to me that every critic out there has been let into the screening of the wrong film..everybody left, right and centre of the world is complaining that this is too long, too loud and in no way a fitting sequel to the first, well honestly, they're idiots! This film does clock in at 2 hours 30 but if you claim to have noticed how long the film had been going on, you're lying to yourself..the film is full of action, a host of new transformers and is honestly seriously worth considering as a comedy..whilst the humour is cheesy for the most part it slots neatly between insane action and special effects. We got a peak with at the true action side of the franchise with the battle at mission city in Transformers, which, whilst remains possibly my favourite piece of cinema ever, is little in comparison to what is on offer here. If you loved the first, you'll love the second and people who say they don't like this, please just think back to what you saw, and reconsider!"
"sipovic","1","57","117","29 June 2009"," Toilet explosion
","I have a hard time to count new Transformers as a movie. It was more a combination of explosions and toilet jokes (since any scene in this hmm, ""project"" ends with either one of them). And so highly praised action sequences after Wolverine, Star Trek and especially Terminator Salvation, Bay's work wasn't so much impressive. All transformers except Optimus Prime and the Yellow One(don't know his name) looked absolutely the same including the Worst Villain of the Year - The Fallen (forget the motivation, he couldn't even transform into anything but he had a BIG STICK instead and his loyal sidekick Megatron whose reasons to be in the ""project"" actually mysterious for me. Most of the human characters could be cut from ""the movie"" and it probably would be for good since it would be less toilet jokes. The dialogs could easily lost a competition to a school play. I mean each time character opened mouth to say something I had a strong urge to slap them to make them shut up. Another problem - the unbearable length of Transformers. 150 minutes. I could only wonder what Michael Bay cuted from his ""movie"" if he thought that the rest was OK. For example the last battle which lasted almost 40 minutes could easily be done in 10 , all college sequences could be easily cuted (another horrible half-hour). In the end it could be only 90 bearable minutes of explosions but unfortunately Spielberg gave his golem to much freedom and Bay simply didn't have enough taste, or objectivity or simply a common sense to see what he had done. Personally for me the most dramatic moment of the movie was a scene where an amazing actor John Turturro dropped his pants. Without any reason. For another silly laugh. Just because M.Bay can make him do it. It is actually my strongest impression which I've got from Transformers - Revenge of Fallen. Not robots, explosions or Megan Fox. It is A John Turturro staying on the street without pants. Michael Bay proved once again that he is still the Worst director in Hollywood today and his new work for me is #1 contender on the title THe Wors Movie of the Year. It is 1/10, 1/5 , it is 1 in any scale of grades I know..."
"mypletka","8","22","40","12 February 2010"," Stop the whining. It's a cool film!

And I do not care that this film does not match the animated series.<br/><br/>from the very beginning I did not expect from the movie deep story - it is not necessary in it. all that is in the film, enough to enjoy. and I'll be waiting eagerly 3rd part of Transformers"
"stee_nolan","8","22","40","27 July 2009"," It got needless and ludicrously bad reviews and I just don't understand
","People call it cheesy, people call it unbelievable and weak. People criticize it's story line. But do these apparent ""professional"" reviewers know what they're watching at all? I'll be hopefully the one of many to tell them that it's Transformers for god sakes! The last thing that I would expect out of an action thriller involving robots/vehicles coinciding with humans to help the planet for the greater good is a deep meaning or moral at the climax of all the CGI special effects! People striving for Oscars strive for a good strong story, not an action/thriller! I mean at the end of the day, it's Transformers we're watching, a former kids TV show.  I would hardly expect to find a massive deep, strengthened story line after it's history of childish, cartoon programming. So what I'm getting at Is, is that this movie did what it was supposed to do. It lived up to the action category!i Drama needs solid story lines far more than anything else in the movie business, so those who judge Transformers on plot are sadly mislead. Transformers (like every movie) needs a structure. It had one. Maybe a bit of a cheesy one, but, to the fools who analyze and criticize it based on plot, remember what your watching.<br/><br/>I mean, dear God! I paid a couple of bucks to see what I hoped to be a thriller that performed to it's genre from start to finish, and let me tell you, it did just that (and over achieved on top of everything else). Transformers was marinaded by non stop thrills and adrenaline kicks of pure action! And the CGI was impeccable! So smooth to watch brawling robots in such crisp detail with the sound effects off the scales in terms of perfection.<br/><br/>It didn't need a strong story line to keep it together. Transformers 2 was the whole package and should only be judged on the category that it performed so fantastically to!<br/><br/>Don't over analyze it and you'll enjoy the show!<br/><br/>Overall rating 8/10"

It just kept me entertaining for 2.5 hrs for which I paid few bucks.<br/><br/>It all depends on personal opinion. This movie is for someone who loves instant action and comedy. Michael Bay is one person who knows how to entertain audiences. I always liked first one and expected more from this one. This has some intense action scenes and funnier moments than the first one. At least for myself I never got bored at any part of the movie and will go watch one more time. So, go have a blast.."

"k-dhesi","7","21","38","1 July 2009"," The CGI Takeover.
","I would love to say Transformers 2 was excellent, i would love to compare it to the first one and comment on what they improved on. I guess i can a little. Action was spot on and much more clearer, cool slow motion shots when necessary and great combat between the robots. In comparison to the first Tranformers instalment it was a lot better. Improved and delivered well in that department.<br/><br/>Tranformers: revenge of the fallen pretty much offers visual action at it's best. Fights, shoot em' up scenes and blowing up things. Effects again were mind blowing, just like the first one the effects were truly amazing (as you would expect) nothing has changed there. With offering all those many flaws, somehow it manages to slip everywhere else. Apart from the robots scenes (who had much more screen time compared to the first one.) It was all just a big waste. The scenes between the characters such as Sam Witwicky (Shia) Mikaela was unnecessary as nothing much got developed. Sam's family still had there touch of comedy, which was good to see. They were pretty hilarious. Also old characters were bought back into it, which was nice to see. New robots were introduced too, but there character content was a little weak. But something still was definitely missing, it wasn't the same. I preferred the way the first Transformers instalment was panned out, i missed the more immature ""human character's"" screen time.<br/><br/>The film does have a long duration, but it didn't really effect me. It went pretty fast. I guess if you prefer a movie with full on fun action, then you will love this one. I suggest you see the first Transformers first though as it introduced the whole ""Transformers saga"" Overall i find it hard to rate. Were it succeeded in many things (action and adventure) i was let down in the many things that didn't remain from the first instalment (social screen time, comedy) Michal Bay again did well and delivered a good sequel, but i hope there will be a third instalment. It's a love it or hate it type of movie, Transformers fans will be pleased. Watch it yourself and then you will know."
"awdevenport","7","21","38","30 June 2009"," Too Many ""Haters""
","OK people stop hating on this movie. The fact is simple. Those of you who are hating on it because it doesn't follow the original cartoons or comics guess what... You are in your late twenties and early thirties or later if you are a nerd. You are not the key demographic for this movie. Micheal Bay had the hardest job of trying to keep the fan kids and those who have only seen these two movies both interested. When there is that much of a generational gap there are always going to be people who trash on it. And the critics.. Who listens to them anymore. If its not some cheesy french bistro indie film then to them its not worth watching. <br/><br/>OK now that I vented enough, to the movie. I got exactly what I expected to get out of a Bay film. Robots who transform from cars and kick ass and giant explosions. The fight scenes were great, the explosions were great, and they do such a great job with the scenes that there is never really a time in the movie where you just point and say ""that is so fake"". So as far as action this movie delivers exactly what was promised.<br/><br/>There are people complaining about how much screen time is taken by watching them transform. Guess what... That is the basis of the whole movie for Gods sake!! The GGI was stunning. Bay and his crew have really taken CGI and other visual effects to the next level.. The fact that Ironhide's gun has 10,000 moving parts alone done with a computer is amazing. Just think of how many moving parts they made for every different car and machine. They try to make as much of it as real as they can get. Reading some interview I found out that they actually jack knifed an 18 wheeler with someone driving it at high speeds and then added the robot smashing though the side of it. Thats makes it more real to the audience and makes a better movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>The acting was fairly good as well. But then it is also where it lacks somewhat. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox both put in solid performances as well as Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. The other humans are just good. Nothing great but nothing bad. There are forgivable character flaws but nothing to rant and rave about. <br/><br/>The only main problem with me was some of the Transformers. They really don't get the screen time they deserve. Ironhide has a few lines but the rest of the Autobots really don't. Arcee and the twins were really unnecessary. Would have liked to see a little more of them, but there wasn't really anything there. There were problems with the Decepticons as well. Megatron is nowhere near the menace he was in the first movie. He almost seems like a weak henchman than a leader in this movie. The Fallen was nothing. <br/><br/>Spoiler Spoiler Spoiler<br/><br/>He was hyped up as the ancient evil decepticon that would bring doom to everyone and was wiped out five minutes after he came to Earth. Wasn't the best antagonist I've seen. Then Optimus beat the crap out of Megatron and sent him packing. Wasn't a great final fight.<br/><br/>All in all, If you read these comments on Transformers please don't listen to what others had to say about it. The best critic for a movie is yourself. If you enjoy giant robot fights, massive explosions, a little comedy, MEGAN FOX!!, and a little hint of a story in the background, by all means go see the movie you wont be disappointed. If your not into that kind of thing then why are you even reading this pages comment section??? Thanks for reading hope this helps"
"c-conley90","7","7","10","11 October 2012"," I see the problems but again critics take it way too far and blow it out of proportion.
","The infamous sequel to the Transformers live action series, infamous for suppose racism (two jive talking robots and a African American guy with bad teeth, do not make a racism movie) plus Tyrese Gibson wasn't doing any stupid steppin-fetch-it comedy act in the movie. He was equally as heroic as the white guys. So I don't see the racism aspect, maybe stereotypical but what movie isn't. Two, the PG-13 level humor, including robot balls humor, farting, hash brownies, tasing, dogs screwing and John Tuturro's ass. The humor is a legitimate point, though I think some of it does work, I agree some isn't good. Especially the Tuturro ass shot, left me cringing. But did it totally cripple the movie, no, the first had a urination gag in it, did it ruin that movie, no. And critics weren't complaining about it. The high amount of comedy relief characters is a little much, Turturro being far and away the best outing the horrible Leo Spitz and the twins. People complained about the length, boy didn't see them complain about that in Pirates 3 or 2012. People criticize the action scenes, I agree a little better editing but what movie doesn't suffer from some bad editing. I must have not noticed it, I saw really beautifully done CGI action scenes. I just think the movie isn't worth the vitriol. I was really just sitting there wondering how critically obtuse people can be. Some people sit there and say that the movie was built for the lowest common denominator and only the easily amused or entertained. I really love such stupid comments, like I can't go to a movie just for a really good action experience and that it has to always make me think. I remember the long rage filled reviews on this movie from Roger Ebert to lowly internet critic Spoony one aka Noah Antwiler (who really had no room to talk as he makes freaking rape jokes on twitter). One of the most infamous was Harry Knowles, one of the stupidest reviews in a long time, telling us to out right ban and boycott the movie based on it's as Harry states racist content. I was downright floored, it's just a movie Knowles calm down. The kind of reaction is just kind of stupid especially from a professional like Knowles. And the racism is largely exaggerated as is the purposed bad treatment of women in the movie. Just because you have Megan Fox in hot clothing and poses doesn't especially make it a portray of women as nothing more than objects of desire considering Fox more than stands her own in an action scene or against one of the human sized robots. And then there's Isabel Lucas as the seductive human decpticon which I know kind of laying it thick in the sexual area for a supposed PG-13 movie. But it ultimately furthered the plot along so what. And I won't argue the plot or the other problems like how Bay knew geography for crap but the movie is fictional so somethings can slide. Some people need to stop nitpicking and just enjoy the movie stop getting all worked up over a fantasy world in a movie. So anyway just see the movie if you want to, don't let others negative opinion sway you, see it for yourself and decide your own opinion. I personally recommend it but my opinion is not status quo. Update: And to add furthermore, people who say this is worst movie in the world have to be ashamed of themselves, they obviously have no real experience watching movies as this movie is far, far away from being the worst. This isn't birdemic people, nor is it a Boll flick or The Room."
"kunalkhandwala","10","38","75","25 June 2009"," Explosive, overwhelming, outstanding!
","Since when did cinema turn into a soulful tirade of realistic sagas of melodramatic proportions that would be weighed boisterously by a bunch of depressed, soul searching and text-bookish critics that are hard hit by the recession???? What about cinema being an escapist's zone where he leaves all his worries and indulges in PURE entertainment?? When did cinema cease to become an arena of one's psychological entertainment?? Why does a summer action flick have to be dark and deep like the Knight of the previous year in order to be entertaining??<br/><br/>The truth is that even if times change, cinema remains an entertainment haven and when you go into the theaters to find your money's worth, you need TO BE Entertained!! So here we have the epitome of Hollywood's entertainment value – Michael Bay's most definitive work to date, as true to his style as it can be Transformers 2 cannot be weighed by critical reviews or by questioning whether it's worth your ticket price.. This movie goes much beyond. It stimulates enough senses to ignore the color of money as we see it. <br/><br/>The $700 million Transformers introduced us to the alien civilization of Robots which were toys for the generations of yesteryears. Now, Bay takes them to another level that its creators couldn't have dreamed of. Shards of the All Spark are found and the knowledge of an old and powerful secret is possessed by Sam. The Decepticons are already in his pursuit and the Autobots who are in a secret alliance with the Government to protect mankind against these elusive enemies, may soon be outnumbered. Revenge is coming There are multiple sub-plots with Sam's family, which cause nothing more than annoyance in the otherwise sturdy plot, Sam and Mikaela's love story that has all the traits of a college romance, the return of Agent Simmons as an aid to the unraveling of the secret and Leo Spitz who is teasingly referred to as a 'shrimp taco' by the hilarious robotic twins –Mudflap and Skids. <br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf will surely be unable to count the worth of his 2 movies which will surpass $1.5 billion. He delivers what is expected of him in the movie. Do not expect the intensity of Christian Bale or the suaveness of Robert Downey Jr. or even the innocence of Tobey Maguire. Having said that, he has played his part to his standards. Josh Duhamel as Major Lennox is outstanding in his role while the others play their limited parts well enough. Sam's Mom is the most annoying character in the film and she does that in a seemingly natural manner. Linkin Park, Green Day, Nickelback, The Fray and Staind are the other important stars in the movie and you shall hear why..<br/><br/>Bay takes the clash of metal to New Mexico, Egypt and Jordan in spectacular locales that form the perfect arena for the mega battles. The action is breath-taking, heart pounding, jaw dropping, fist clenching and eye popping to say the least. Tranformers 1 seems like just a preview to this movie in terms of visual effects and mega action sequences. What George Lucas did with 'Star Wars', Spielberg did with 'Jurassic Park', Peter Jackson did with the 'Lord of the Rings' and Pixar did with 'Wall-E' and 'Up', Michale Bay has done it with Transformers. He summarizes all the technology, skill, talent, creativity, mega bucks and powerful imagination that Hollywood is famous for, as symbolically projected in the form of 'Devastator' – the Decepticon formed as a combination of construction machinery. The high-octane sequence in Shanghai in the opening moments is a powerful introduction and if you thought that the clash between Megatron and Optimus Prime in the first movie was epic, wait till you watch Prime battle it out against numerous Decepticons in the forest!! <br/><br/>Did the critics talk about the lack of a meaningful, soul searching story and a 'human' side to the movie?? WHO THE #$%@?!! CARES!!! When you have a Gargantuan finale in the desert with Decepticons, Autobots, soldiers, warships, tanks, helicopters and fighter planes all over the place will give you enough reason to shriek with excitement. There is more explosion, gunfire and clang of metal in Transformers 2 than one can handle So what did you expect out of this movie anyway?? A Robot's journey through human experiences and its realization that the planet is just about dominated by a bunch of dope heads who have forgotten what sheer entertainment is all about??!!<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen cannot be measured with a ticket price or by the words of some #$%!@ minds who would rather be thrilled by the advent of a 'High School Musical 4' . For the others who would wisely watch it on IMAX, hearts will pound, pulse will race, laughter will roar, fists will be tightened, the fury of the testosterone in you will elevate to epic proportions like never before in theaters and in the end, Applause! Indeed, there is more than meets the eye with The Transformers.<br/><br/><ul><li>9.22 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"
"snarf132","9","20","36","16 June 2010"," ""action packed""
","Transformers was a hit one of my favorite movies!i loved the comedy,action and Megan fox! the one thing i don't like about it was the ending it left as a cliff hanger just like the first. so Michael bay has to make another installment and i heard they are directing it right now but without Megan fox. what transformers without Megan fox the third film will not do as well in the box office. most of the ratings i see are about Megan fox.she was apparently talking bad to her director. but enough with that i thought the movie was good with john Tuttoro and Autobot twins. bumble bee as a tricked out Camero. but i really liked the movie all together Shia Laboef did a great job in the part of Sam Witwicky i loved the movie! if they don't use Megan fox in the next installment i will not see it."
"tommyfox-3","7","20","36","23 October 2009"," Missing nostalgia of what we want
","So, I just finished watching the movie. It was up and down for my take. First, what the hell was all the ridiculousness of Sam's mom visiting him in college. Please, let's bring a marijuana reference to make us laugh. Come on, that was as low brow as it gets. Also, not to break up the fact that the effects are amazing, but it is extremely hard to tell who is who in this movie! I mean, give me more colors and an easy way to decipher whether these guys are Autobots or Decepticons. Say their names for God sake!!! I almost, nay, I do miss the 1986 movie where at least I knew who I was seeing and could root for or hate against the robots because I knew who they were. Also, what the hell happened to Devastator??? I thought I heard he was in this movie but failed to see him or any constructagons at all. Michael Bay, you do an amazing job with action and special effects so bravo. However, as a fan and as most people watching should be fans, it lacks on some basic levels. First, don't introduce ridiculous characters (the twins) who were a complete social shall I say rip-off of a genre which didn't need to even be there?? I'd rather take two robots who were just robots than to offend a race or ethnicity by what you did. Now, I'll just rant on what I thought could have been better. Megan Fox....you are dumb. She really did absolutely nothing and did not even need to be in this movie. Sam, (nitpicking now), could have been called Spike to start with since we all remember Spike from the original series but have no clue where Sam came from. Bumblebee...became a badass robot?? Should be smaller and able to freaking TALK!! Where are the robots we remember? Jazz, Hound, Sideswipe? At least you mentioned Ironhide. Did Shockwave just sit in outer space?? What the hell was that for? Yes, we saw Prowler, but no Soundwave? He was the bomb in the series. Again, and I can't stress this enough, there should be more mention to who we're seeing and more colors to represent who we see. Most decpticons were plain silver (gray metal) and we had no clue who they were showing. I think Michael Bay needs to sit down and actually watch a whole series to get what the audience would like to see. The premise and plot was good for the movie, but it was all over the place with random characters, weird enemies we didn't recognize, and robots who came and left and were not heard from again. I absolutely LOVED the original transformer movie because it brought in all the characters from the original series, gave us a good plot and scenario of what was going on, and brought in new characters and events that we could follow and enjoy. There will be a third movie, yes, I know. I already think that it will be another shoot off of Shia and Megan Fox and some plot dealing with just Megatron and Optimus Prime. Ho hum. If you really want to draw everyone in, bring in characters we all know, a LOT of them. Bring in the Dinobots! Bring in the bots that transform into the Huge bots such as DEVASTATOR. And please,please, make the transforming 'sound' when they transform. That was the standard and I actually liked when I heard that. Yes, you brought in a lot of action, suspense, and thrilling things to see. BUT, you left out what a lot of us miss, which is having the things we came to see in the first place! Bring us more characters we know and love, mention their names, even make the characters more cartoony, and not so machine-like. I like my polygons to be quick to recognize if they are a truck, car, or plane. Not take 3 minutes to see if they transform into a radio. All I'm leaving this with is I feel the fans of Transformers want what we love, not what Michael Bay thinks is the 'hip' kind of robots. Remember what made this popular is what will continue to make it popular. Autobots! Roll out!"
"CagedinSanity","7","20","36","14 July 2009"," Flawed, but what isn't? I loved it.
","I just watched 4 movies in 2 days so excuse me if my brain is a little fragmented.<br/><br/>One of the main problems with the first movie is that there wasn't enough screen time of the robots in their own movie. People can say what they want, but they really fixed that in this movie.<br/><br/>It's got it's share of human side-stories but I believe some of that is somewhat necessary. And it doesn't waste TOO much time in the beginning with it. I never saw the original cartoon so I'm not sure if the protagonist human had a romantic other, but it does fine and fits (to an extent... I doubt normal teenage girls want to fly 3000 miles so they can wrap themselves up in a robot war... again. I think any sane woman would be filing for a break up at that point). It's also in the humans where we find a lot of the humor, which is FINE. The ex-Sector 7 guy is a wonderful actor and pretty much an instant comedy-relief character who always does well with the part he is given. Exaggerated? Sure. Overacted? Maybe. Awesome? You bet your ass. (Or his, actually. Haha.) So, one can go on all day about the effects... but chances are, even if you hate the movie you can already admit they're good. If not decent at best. And they are great.<br/><br/>So let's get to the nitpicking.<br/><br/>The 'twins'. Are you serious? I suppose it makes a little bit of sense, trying to wrap in the younger crowds (and absolutely nothing else), but really... Someone want to explain to me how perfect transformer robots have gold teeth and are accent-ridden? (The small blue decepticon, while cute, was DUMB). In my opinion most of them should probably sound the same, Megatron and Prime happen to have the only voices that make SENSE to their robotic nature.<br/><br/>I loved the 'old guy' decepticon. I also know how he's supposed to be old but can someone explain to me why a robot is COUGHING and has a random obligatory old-guy 'beard' and wheel-cane? Is that really necessary? Though, I loved the character and is probably my favorite in the entire movie... now if only I can find out his name.<br/><br/>A lot of people say all the 'action' is blurred and looked like those cartoon clouds that covered all the fights with big ""POOF""s and ""BAM""s... But I'm not an idiot, and actually PAID ATTENTION to the battles. I could actually make out what they were doing, unlike a lot of you idiots. The battles were great, and the giant robot that use several vehicles was awesome and immediately reminded me that the TOYS actually used to DO that. I'm glad they remembered to fit that in.<br/><br/>So there you have it. I liked what people hated... all the while still recognizing its flaws. But there are not many perfect movies out there... which is OKAY. Not all of them have to be mind blowing. And Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a worthy watch."
"xtina782","6","20","36","21 June 2009"," good! my opinion...
","what can i say! i've literally just stepped in the door and felt the need to write a review. Although i felt the movie was awesome, i still felt there were a handful of negatives regarding the movie as a whole. <br/><br/>here is the handful of negatives!<br/><br/>1. megan fox. her acting is MUCH better than the first movie. and i remember reading an interview where she actually said ""i've worked much harder on my acting this time round"". sam's mother is also quite annoying, but you either love her or hate her.<br/><br/>3. there's a lot of scenes that were pointless. they could have easily cut down the movie half an hour shorter. so yes...the movie is incredibly long! make sure you choose a cinema with comfy seats! <br/><br/>4. there's a slight drag to scenes. <br/><br/>but the movie holds so many positives which is why it's a must see movie.<br/><br/>1. the graphics are INCREDIBLE <br/><br/>2. many believe there wasn't much of a story line???? they're WRONG. in fact, there's more of a story line the second time round. <br/><br/>3. bigger and bolder characters. when i say bigger...i mean bigger! there's two that are HUGE compared to optimus prime. <br/><br/>4. humour. the movie holds different types of humour: humour that will appeal to just the children, just the adults and both. so great family movie<br/><br/>5. original cast members. some may hate this, but i don't. I like seeing the same people. even the guy from sector 7 is in it! who, might i add, is one of the best characters in the movie. but the only person i see missing is Jon Voight. which is no biggie because he didn't play a vital character. <br/><br/>I honestly could go on, on and on. It really is a good movie. oh! and there's something really important that you should know. DO NOT WAIT FOR THIS TO COME OUT ON DVD. why? 1. Small screens will not give this movie justice. 2. i don't think it's a movie suitable to own on DVD. i wouldn't be able to sit still while watching it...it's sooooo long"
"italia456","3","64","134","29 June 2009"," It's a shame I'm not an over stimulated 18-25 male
","Or I might have enjoyed this. I went in with the understanding that there would be a lot of action, but I also went in with the expectation of the same amount of human dialogue and screen time from the first one, if not more. I didn't care about the characters in the slightest, and it's because the main characters were no longer Sam and his family and friends. They were robots; poorly scripted uninteresting robots. Like I said, wonderful for boys who need 98% of a film to be consistent explosions and action. It is not, however, enjoyable for anyone who is not the aforementioned. I honestly would have left had i not been there at the request of my boyfriend. Don't waste your time."
"Moviegeek93","8","19","34","18 February 2010"," Overall, a great sequel to a great film
","Transformers: Revenge of the fallen is a movie directed by Michael Bay and produced by the legendary Steven Spielberg. I did not have the fortune to see this on the big screen but i finally watched it on DVD not long ago.<br/><br/>It's hard to come by sequels like this these days. I wish i had gone to the cinema when it came out, the fast paced action and the effects are just amazing. The whole movie is worth seeing just because of them. The plot is decent: some gaps here and there but nothing too bad. I mean it's still a Transformers movie so what do you expect. The acting is good, especially for the two leading characters. The ending is not that great and it brings down my hopes for the third film.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the fallen is a great action flick that most of the transformers fans will love. It is a movie that everyone should check at least once and i definitely don't regret buying the DVD.<br/><br/>8/10"
"roshieharris","9","19","34","24 August 2009"," Escapists Unite!
","Let's start off with the fact that this movie is based on a toy. Granted there is the plot lines from the animated series to go by, but some things don't translate well to the big screen (i.e. Megatron transforms into a big gun...) Oscar worthy? Definitely not. All that was promised was more robots, more visual effects, more noise,...just more of the same. It had just as many plot holes as the first. The romance was unnecessary (I know Megan Fox is ""in"" right now but really?). The twins were outrageous and seemed to only be there as filler and it had other unnecessary characters. Overall it was exactly what was promised. Intellectually stimulating? Not even close. It's a loud, rollicking, fun, brainless good time for those of us who go to the movies without wanting to leave enlightened."

"kashif-coles","3","60","125","10 July 2009"," Big Budget but small brains
","After watching the jaw dropping first installment I entered the cinema hall with many expectations but when I came out after watching the movie I was left with a feeling of utter disappointment and frustration.<br/><br/>The story is ridiculous to say the least.The screenplay is pathetic filled with crap .There is a complete disregard for continuity and common sense.There is plenty of unnecessary stuff going on in this movie.I can recall only a single truly funny scene and the movie has no proper dialogue at all. Sure summer blockbusters tend to be no-brainers but this movie takes it to a new level.<br/><br/>There are a bucket load of special effects shown but they hardly have been put to good use by the director.They are wasted on a lot of unnecessary scenes. Its saddening really because they must have spent a huge amount of money and put in a lot of effort to make these special effects. They should have used the money to hire better writers.<br/><br/>Sure there are some awesome scenes especially the ones involving Optimus Prime and of course the transformations.Some action scenes were amazing. Some scenes still give you the goosebumps. But most of them are chaotic and have no proper direction whatsoever. What we end up watching on screen is senseless and direction less metal-on-metal action with a whole lot of explosions and robots just firing at each other from everywhere. <br/><br/>The transformers still look amazing but they seem better in the first part.There a lot of new ones involved this time and sometimes you struggle to differentiate between the autobots and the decepticons.There are a few irritating transformers as well. The transformation sequences of the robots are not shown as well as in the first movie but are still incredible though, the sequences in the first part were much better.<br/><br/>Megan Fox sizzles on screen. But she has been used too much in excess, no doubt to cover up the innumerable flaws in this movie(which of course she doesn't). Shia LeBeouf does a pretty good job. Apart from the military guys the other characters are horrible,dumb, painfully irritating and totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>The climax shot in Egypt and Jordan is ridiculous.I sure did expect much more from it in terms of action.The climax in the first one was incredible and left you amazed. The direction is incredibly horrible. This is truly a very lazy attempt at making a movie, I think the makers knew the movie would become a smash hit because of the hype of the first movie and hence have come up with such a piece of crap.<br/><br/>3/10...3 is just for some incredible special effects,some good action sequences and Megan Fox of course."

Were you the gremlin behind me in Godzilla going,""yeah,that 200ft Lizard is unrealistic man, he should have been more of a Raptor."" <br/><br/>Some other comment gems I found: <br/><br/>""The Animation hadn't improved since the first one."" Well, I think a little research is necessary. http://www.cinefex.com/ and MANY other sources. The forest scene alone should make you feel shame for saying that. Some other highly intelligent comments ( insert sarcasm here )<br/><br/>""This is a terrible film by ANY standard."" ""cinematography was poor.""<br/><br/>This person = FAIL. Do you believe ""Documentary Style"" camera shake for no reason that appears on soo many Oscar contenders is cinematography? If so,it's time for you to have a nap.. a long one. <br/><br/>""Robots look alike."" The ugliest robot design I have EVER seen, The (animators)should've gone with something resembling the original designs from the 80s cartoon."" <br/><br/>HAHA,laughable.Clearly a Visual effects wizard and an expert in production who could do all this alone,and wouldn't need the ""Animators"" to design the robots. Since animating big chunky robots would be impossible, and animators don't design on production,you are wrong and fail.. on sooo many levels.. :) Better to be thought a fool dude. By the way, the designs were bad ass. <br/><br/>Well, I have to say, I would love to stop hearing about everybody's whining issues with this movie,and start hearing some positives,but I'm sure everybody will be mad at it for being ""too awesome"" for awhile. So what Iwill say is,you have to realize how many people out there kill themselves on a daily basis to bring you films at all.It's not all big money for all the crews out there.<br/><br/>I DO think this movie deserves AT LEAST a nom for the Oscar in more than a couple categories. To everybody who hates this film and Michael Bay: Let's see YOUR movie. I can't wait to tear it apart.. Oh no wait,, you just talk the talk.. Transformers(both)were AWESOME!!!Congrats on a great job to the prod crew and to all the artists. To who said ""Too many Robots"" "" Too many explosions"" ..really!!??? Who ARE you? Can you HAVE too many robots? Is it possible? Do you hate bunnies? I'm off to dream about TF3. I CAN'T WAIT for MICHAEL BAY to make another one,and how awesome it will be if it's done with massive Bayhem!(With MORE robots and explosions of course.:)Enjoy yelling at me when I'm gone,but I will probably just be out having fun with a GIRL.Or doing digital effects so I can help people like Michael Bay make more awesome films! So you it won't effect me. :) Stay Hungry, and Shoot for the edit! :)<br/><br/>Seriously,I hope you can see this for what it is,the way you SHOULD have seen TF."

I was waiting for Optimus to snap and go Bas Rutten crazy since the first movie and now he truly delivered. Watch the scene in the forest.<br/><br/>I am happy to say this movie keeps within the very essence of the Transformers that i grew up with. A lot of rockets and stuff shooting out from bodyparts and action sequences that captures the very soul of the original cartoon.<br/><br/>It feels like the movieteam they really did their research this time around the myth, legend and personality of the transformers.<br/><br/>From a Hollywood mainstream point of view i would say the the story is kinda mediocre, but from Transformers and Sci-Fi fans point of view, this is exaclty the kinda original story and problems you would find in the actual cartooon.<br/><br/>Other than that i think the CGI is probably the best ever produced to blend in with human size ratio and with the natural envoirments of earth. CGI blew me away. They did a damn impressing job! <br/><br/>This is way better than the first movie. This time they had a better and more interesting variety and line-up of psycho robots of all sizes, mechanisms and missions from the world of TF.<br/><br/>I don't wanna spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet, so all i can say to is Sci-fi action fans, go and see it.<br/><br/>PS..

It didn't need to have a great storyline because all I cared about was fast paced entertainment and eye candy which it delivered on and then some. The only downfall, without trying to sound to harsh, was watching Megan Fox try to act. She's great to look at but I haven't seen her do any acting worth watching yet. <br/><br/>Now, after Avatar exceeded everyone's expectation with his 3D extravaganza, I'm looking forward to what Bay can do with it.

"solex10","9","18","32","27 February 2010"," Face it, haters...this movie does rock!
","Transformers: Revenger Of The Fallen may not be Lawrence Of Arabia, but as a sci-fi flick, it kicks ass for me. Once again, ILM has stepped up to the plate with effects that make you believe robots look real, can fight, and even have emotions (Bumblebee's 'crying' as Sam Witwicky leaves for college is a stand out). The story isn't much....or is it? I think that it is, and that having all of the solar system be threatened with a supernova due to Megatron's need for Energon qualifies as a plot point: I sure was on the edge of my seat hoping that Optimus Prime would stop him, or that somebody would. I was also scared for Sam when that lady Decepticon almost broke up his relationship with his girlfriend (and left to go to the washroom hoping he'd be okay).<br/><br/>The part of the plot that's weak for me is the comedy relief robots whose names I forget now; they don't add much to the plot, and they should have use a better comedy relief template than Afro-American B-boys (I would have used Larry, Curly, and Moe from The Three Stooges, or Abbott & Costello instead, as they are timeless!): I would rather have seen more of the female Autobots (Arcee & Co.) but overall, a fine adventure movie, with the fantastic most satisfactorily realized and put up on screen, and also NOT a bomb in the way that others think that it is-I'd rather go to the movies to see this than watch ANYTHING from the Sundance Film Festival, with its plethora/parade of messed up human beings masquerading as characters."
"aidar24","8","18","32","18 February 2010"," 8.5/10
","First I'm going to start off with that the movie had great special effects. Comparing it with the first movie (Transformers 2007), It did a well job on keeping me entertained, with many explosions, fight scenes, and (Megan Fox) moments. The thing that surprised me was, or kept me wondering, was the scene jumps. Many people don't care about this much or don't notice it. <br/><br/>For an a example, When Sam was running from the Decepticons in Egypt, he jumped away from a missile and landed face down. Then a second later, out of Nowhere, He was on his feet running, like nothing happened. This bothers me, I know they need to cut out scenes to make the movie shorter. But the director (Michael Bay) could have done better job on this kind of mistake. This movie isn't a reality, but at-lest make it reasonable.<br/><br/>Otherwise the movie was just great (8.5). The story line makes clear sense, it's not like the ""Da Vinci Code"", where it's hard to follow up on. In the beginning of the movie The ""Fallen"" have been here before our lifetime (21st century), and have tried to destroy the earth. But the Primes stopped them from the destruction or extinction of the human race. After many years of hiding, the Fallen have came back for revenge, They bring back Megatron to life to help them, on a mission they once failed. <br/><br/>Many funny scenes in this movie. The parents of Sam, are funnier than the last one. Every character played a role to make the movie feel like it deserved to be a sequel. For instance the military soldiers, Major Lennox(Josh Duhamel) and Master Sergeant (Tyrese Gibson) made humorous lines.<br/><br/>Overall the movie, has found a place in my movie collection. My rank for this out of my 5,000 list: # 1,888"

","I have reviewed this movie and Orphan before, but with new fans of my reviews and a change of time I feel it necessary to re-review. so, Transformers 2, oh I'm sorry, Transformers Revenge of the fallen, or TROTF for short. take off the first T and we have ROTF. which is close to Rolf which can be said as Ralph, so I'm just going to call this movie Transforming Ralph cuz it sounds cool, and if I had a dog named Ralph who could transform that'd be cool too. anyways, Transforming Ralph is a movie that inspires kids not to do drug-- no wait... it makes u wanna murder yur mother in la-- dammit... ah! here we go. *ahem* Transforming Ralph is a movie that will catch you by the throat at the very beginning and not let go until the end. constant explosions, action, drama, and a deep story/plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire movie. with he return of favorites such as Bumblebee and Irnohide, and the introduction of new (and just as lovable) characters such as the Twins (Skids and Mudflap) and Sideswipe. The movie features a more in depth intense plot this time around with a non-stop action packed thrill ride that leaves you almost breathless. it's a like if you hooked up an IV full of Mountain Dew to a diabetic monkey with ADHD. and it's not just the action, no no. the jokes. many scenes contain the ""smart ass"" humor of 2009 mixed with hidden sexual innuendos to make it more relateable to the teenage community and not just the 140-something year olds who grew up with the cartoon. overall, this was the BEST action movie of 2009, hands down. my rating: 10/10"
"sebastianbishop8749","7","18","32","26 October 2009"," Transformers 2 A Decent Sequel With Some Flaws
","Let me say that I'm a fan of the first Transformers movie. It had some flaws but I still enjoyed it overall. The same goes for this sequel which after seeing twice I actually liked this film more the second time than I did the first. Yeah it has flaws that were in the original but this sequel isn't as bad as critics made it out to be. It does suffer from a rushed finale (Optimus vs The Fallen), an abrupt ending, and not a whole lot of character development for the robots but that's all right because I guess they served their purpose. Most of the humor worked too except for some that didn't. Michael Bay is a talented director and he's admirable in giving audiences more of everything (giant robots, intense action, special effects and humor) in this one which worked for the most part. Labeouf reprises the role of Sam Witwicky providing his usual comic relief and he's believable as the character. Megan Fox is all right as Mikaela but isn't given much to do except to be eye candy. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back as well and they're good in their limited screen time. John Turturo is also back and he does a good job as the wacky former Sector 7 Agent Simmons. The rest of the cast are okay including the military and Sam's parents. The special effects are top notch and the robot action/fight sequences are well executed. The one that stood out is between Optimus and three Decepticons in a fierce forest showdown that leaves the Autobots leader ready for the scrap yard. The biggest flaw this movie has is the treatment given to most of the robots. Many of the new Decepticons including Soundwave, Grindor, Ravage, and Demolisher among many others merely show up for a few minutes before being destroyed or disappearing only to be killed off much later when they reappear briefly for the desert climax. The same can go to the new Autbots introduced too including Arcee, Jolt, Jetfire, and Sideswipe because they arrive early on (except for Jetfire who shows up in the second half) but then after that they only make brief appearances throughout the movie but their characters are okay despite only being given a few minutes of screen time. Even returning ones like Optimus, Bumblee, Ironhide and especially Ratchet seem to be fighting for screen time because the're MIA for large parts of the movie. Optimus isn't in it for a very large part of the second half but I was glad to see he eventually returns briefly for the third act so his character is sure to be back for the third one. Bumblebee like the other Autobots seem to be in their vehicle modes for a majority of the move but they do get their moments. Megatron and Starscream get a little more to do than the first one action and screen time wise but not by much. The two characters I was little disappointed in were The Fallen and Devastator. They both get at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time. The Fallen could've been a good villain but he's killed off in his only fight near the end by Optimus way too easily and he could've been a much more worthy adversary. Devastator had promise and looked like cool but the joke with the wrecking balls for his well you know I didn't find all that funny. Not to mention Devastator doesn't show up until near the end is easily defeated like The Fallen. Scorpnok makes a blink and you missed it cameo in the desert climax before being killed off as quickly as he appeared. There seemed to be too many robots on both sides but as mentioned before I guess they sort of served their purpose by giving the movie an action/fight sequence. The only two characters to get any sort of development were the Twin Autobots. I didn't find them racist like some critics did and they're not as bad as you might assume. More screen time could have been given to Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, or Ratchet without them but hey thats all right. The abrupt ending left you wondering about what happened to many of the characters who didn't die. There was also a part late into the film where Sam gets hurt and then a second later his hand is bandaged up so this seemed like an error by the writers for not coming up with a better way to put Labeouf's real life injury into the movie. The ending does leaves the door open for another sequel but I hope if they do make a third film they improve the flaws that were in the previous ones. The humor was often funny (Sam's mom eating brownies) while others not so much (Dog/Robot Humping and the joke with Devastator). The movie was a little long but the action make's it move at a relatively steady pace though. Overall despite it's flaws Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is a decent sci-fi adventure with plenty of robot action, some humor, and good performances by the cast. This sequel could've been a little better but Transformers 2 is worth watching and I still enjoyed it. So if you're a fan of the first film you'll probably like this one as well."

"brubonch","8","18","32","4 October 2009"," far better than i expected after reading all criticism
","The main reason i'm doing this piece is 'cause of the shocking contrast between what I expected to see, having read a host of bashing comments and reviews, primarily on rottentomatoes, and my actual impression of this movie!! Rarely does actual experience exceed the expectations to such an extent. Well, first of all, I would like to encourage EVERYONE (at least everyone with at least a mild interest in sci-fi movies and a fraction of sense of humor) to pay NO attention whatsoever to an avalanche of negative comments prevalent on the net and in the press. Be your own judges - don't listen to overzealous and humorless critics who prove time and again they are the LEAST RELIABLE GUIDE for a moviegoer. Rely on their opinions - and u will be most of the time watching boring wacky cr.p while missing out on decent flicks.I never trusted them, never will...<br/><br/>But back to the movie: without going into detail - just a few words about pros and cons: <br/><br/>I) PROS: 1) very impressive special effects 2) innovative characters (and humorous too - the decrepit,rusty decepticon from the space museum alone is worth a watch:)) a truly hilarious character, the two twin-autobots constantly fighting each other), the gigantic pyramid destroyer composed of a number of heavy-duty machinery units, etc.) 3) EXCELLENT humor throughout the movie, sustained by various characters and situations, starting with shia and turturo and ending with robots themselves 4) very fast-paced, dynamic,entertaining, never boring or going astray (except, probably for blowing the parents' part out of all proportions); 5) Megan fox, of course - pleasure to watch and a rare beauty 6) and finally, the movie gives the impression of a whole, consistent unit, not one fractioned into great but loosely connected pieces) <br/><br/>II) CONS 1) TOO MUCH PROMINENCE GIVEN TO SHIA'S PARENTS - it's totally unwarranted and sometimes plain ridiculous 2) Megan fox, of course:))) (don't get me wrong but she deserves to be in both pros and cons, because beautiful as this girl is, she is true calamity as an actor. hopefully she will pick up, but as of now she reminds me of Michael madsen - ALWAYS THESAME EXPRESSION ON THE FACE (barring one episode where she was crying naturally, which i guess was the result of Mr.Bay kicking her a.se for deadpan acting, so she just freaked out, while the cameraman filmed it all:))) 3) perhaps a touch too long (could've been 15-20 min shorter without any damage to speak of) - mostly, again, due to the overblown parents' part As far as I'm concerned, the pros BY FAR outweigh the cons - it's just beyond discussion - and I would easily recommend this entertaining, in parts hilarious, funny flick to anyone who wants to have some brainless - but high quality - fun!!<br/><br/>NB: IMPORTANT WARNING! - JUST DON'T TAKE THIS MOVIE SERIOUSLY - if from the very beginning you treat it as a fast-paced sci-fi comedy packed wiht action and stupendous special effects as well as featuring funny and memorable characters (among both humans and robots), you will enjoy it from start to finish.GUARANTEED! <br/><br/>PS:Don't hesitate to take kids along - they will be grateful to you more than u can imagine). PPS: goes without saying, a big screen is an absolute must!"
"oipluckie-543-610185","9","18","32","30 September 2009"," Great Movie not perfect
","I don't understand all these reviews about people disliking the movie or it is without a storyline. The movie had action, a plot and comedy. Even though the plot wasn't as intricate or indulging as others it was still an interesting plot. I mean viewers don't go to see this movie for an amazing in depth storyline, but for the action and comedy. I laugh at how most of these reviews say it was boring and the comedy bland, but from where I was sitting in the theaters, most of the audience laughed, ""Hmm"" very boring indeed.<br/><br/>The plot isn't one that you'd really have to think about, but it did set a story. A good enough story to get the action started, and the comedy wasn't top notch but it was funny enough to get the audience going. I'm sure these ""critics"" think movies like ""Dance Flick"" or ""Meet the Spartans"" were funny (Horrible Movies). The comedy in the movie wasn't really what you call brainless or bland. Each bot had their own personality, though not original but they were funny.<br/><br/>The action was fast and visuals amazing. The way they transformed and moved around were so fluid, it always amazed me. The battles were beautiful and was glad to see Optimus Prime finally kicking some Decepticon ass. In the first movie he was getting tossed about a lot.<br/><br/>Finally all the characters did well. Was happy to see that Sam's parents were more in the story, and they were comedic too. In the end I thought the movie was top notch and not the brainless action flick some critics say it was. All depends on the viewer really. Rating = Enjoyable film with the family"
"thebackofmyhouse","8","18","32","27 September 2009"," More enjoyable than the first one
","I hated the first Transformers movie. The reason I hated it was because I had very high expectations for the movie. Being a fan of the cartoon series, I expected it to have a somewhat serious tone and a coherent story. The movie could have been so much better in the right hands. I couldn't understand at that time why anyone would enjoy this crappy excuse of a movie. The first movie also lowered my expectations for the sequel, and the all round bad reviews that the second movie got when it was released in theaters didn't help either.<br/><br/>And after watching Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen on DVD, I am surprised to say that I enjoyed the movie a lot. The silly jokes somehow worked for me this time, and the nonsensical story actually made sense to me (at the time i was watching it). Now it's the opposite, I can't understand why people hate this movie so passionately. It's not the greatest movie of all time, but it's a summer action movie that delivers what it advertises.<br/><br/>If you are going to watch this movie at home, make sure you watch it in HD. One regret I had while watching the movie was not getting the Blu-ray version of it. The DVD version just isn't comparable to the Blu-ray version I saw a little of. This movie is made to be watched in HD. The action and and special effects are what I enjoyed most about the movie and it needs to be seen in all its HD glory to truly appreciate it.<br/><br/>They have toned down the use of the ""shaky cam"" technique compared to the first movie and as a result, the action was more discernible this time. You actually know who's fighting whom most of the time and which limb they are using to beat each other up. Plus, the use of slow motion for ""cool"" action set pieces helped too.<br/><br/>My advice for anybody that's going to watch Transformers 2 is to turn off your brain, get in mood to see lots of explosions and huge robots fighting each other with some juvenile jokes sprinkled in between. You'll be rewarded with two and a half hours of pure unadulterated fun."
"sinistabob","7","18","32","29 July 2009"," My thoughts.
","Well lets get started. A lot of you are saying that the story to Transformers is boring, well mostly are saying it's non existent. The special effects are mind blowing, but overwhelm everything. There is no character development, and roles seem rushed. The plot is filled with so many holes that if you stumpled in your soul would be lost forever.<br/><br/>Well a lot of it is true. But I still give this seven out of ten, why? I did start off with a four out of ten, but I changed it. I used my imagination to make up for all the stupid things that didn't make sense but could of. Then I decided that what I thought up and how it should of been made deserved a seven. <br/><br/>Lets start with the plot, it is pretty simple to follow. The Fallen wants to use a weapon thats been on Earth for god knows how long to destroy the Sun. But he needs the Matrix to start it. So it's up to the Autobots and Sam to stop him and the rest of the Decipticons. In the end they do. It is really simple, but next to impossible to understand in this movie.<br/><br/>For one Michael Bay, or the writers, have added in that it could be used to revive Optimus as well. But they never explained why they had to do all that, when Sam could of used the piece of the Spark he had to revive him. Just like Megatron was revived by the other piece. And on top of that why couldn't they use the piece that was used for Megatron to revive Jazz. Isn't that something Prime would want. Speaking of characters from the first film, where the hell is Barricade? He survived the first film didn't he?<br/><br/>Number two, the Fallen broadcast a message throughout the entire world ordering the human race to find Sam Whitwicky, but after that throughout the movie no one seem fussed. At all. And the way characters just disappear out of the movie, like that RC Truck guy. He just left out of the movie completely, and Jetfire was out for a large portion, no one knows why and he just shows in the end to save the day for Optimus. And the characters that got focus in the movie for one or two lines? Why? Schoolboy from Rambo(he's a good actor) but for one or two lines with attention focused on him. The story should stick who is meant to be the main characters and not cameos. <br/><br/>Speaking of main characters now, aren't the true characters of this film the Autobots and Decipticons? They are the ones who should be getting the focus. Seriously could you imagine if Gollum from Lord of the Rings got as much focus as Ironhide in the movie, it would destroy it. I mean Ironhide and Ratchet are two of the main Autobots but get no real part at all. More attention is focused on the U.S. military then them, and their weapons are next to useless against the Decepticons.<br/><br/>As for the humour, it's funny to a point. But it crossed that point by thirty million light years. Thats all I'm gonna say about that. There is plenty more to bitch about, like for istance the special effects overwhelm the story. Michael Bay you should really watch Lord of the Rings, the special effects strengthen the story by not being the centre of attention to much and more in the background for most parts. And there is nearly no emotion in any Transformer except Bumblebee, Optimus and Starscream. The rest are bleak as can be.<br/><br/>Enough bitching, lets move on to some positives. First the score for the film, is brilliant. I can listen to the score and feel shivers in my spine, which is a really really good thing. And on top of that it some how fits in to the mish mash of a script and makes scenes feel more epic. Steve Jablounsky, you have talent. <br/><br/>Bumblebee, you are awesome. You kept me interested the entire time, and you really did kick ass in this movie. Ripping that stupid tiger thing in half made my day when I seen the movie. Optimus, the forest battle. EPIC is the only word to describe it. <br/><br/>And the basic story for the movie was good and could of worked a lot better, I really hope directors, producers do read through everyones comments and think about them. Because Michael Bay has the green light for a third movie, and if he doesn't read all these comments he will make another Revenge of the Fallen. Michael Bay take my advice, follow James Cameron, Peter Jackson etc. and put the story before everything and let the special effects strengthen it. The fans will love, the non fans will come to love it and you will love it 100 times more for yourself.<br/><br/>Cheers Brendan out."

","if you want to enjoy this movie just don't go in expecting a dark knight reprise......u'll surely be disappointed. but if u are kinda guy who loves adrenaline pumping action sequences and the typical Michael bay stuff......u r in for a ride of a lifetime.<br/><br/>The action sequences are really incredible and its hard to believe that its CGI most of the time.u never get a chance to say "" oh that is so fake"" kudos to Michael bay.i have been a big fan of his movies and except maybe pearl harbour i liked all of his movies. the robo-fights are really well choreographed though a bit difficult to follow, but if you pay a little attention it looks wicked cool. humour is good though a bit outrageous but barring the scene of the dogs humping, close up of john torturro's trunks etc. it all goes down well.the twins are gud and i don't think they were racist. they provide the necessary comical relief amidst the fast-paced metallic slam-bang action. the story too is interesting and the opening shanghai sequence- the bailing out of optimus prime and telling demolisher to ""pull over"" to the sideswipe's skating and slicing the AUDI R8 from the middle with a blade and his 'DAMN, I'M GOOD "" expression is simply breathtaking and sets up the tone for the rest of the movie perfectly. personally i enjoyed this movie to my hearts content..maybe bcoz i am 18 and i love to see things blown up and hardcore action but definitely not only bcoz of the SFX cuz i absolutely hate harry potter series and to an extent the LOTR trilogy. JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR THE THIRD ONE!!!!"

","If the title of my summary doesn't make any sense, let me explain.<br/><br/>I begin with..I loved the Transformers when i was kid..The cartoons just blew me away..In the 80's era cartoons seem to change..They had story lines..There was a slick little story behind all the action..GI Joe also followed this format to a degree..(Although as i waited for the movie to begin with the crowd, the GI Joe trailer came on..I heard a couple of giggles in the packed house..I don't know about THAT Franchise as a movie!!..but back to this one) The first Transformers movie..was a bit of a shock to my system..I though to myself(before i saw it)How is going to be any good??Can they make it look real?? Well Well...They gave it to the right director. and Paramount did the rest..Everything was damn near perfect!!So success(IE. money!!) breeds sequels..<br/><br/>If my expectations were low going into tans 1..They were off the charts for Reveng of the Fallen..The trailers looked awesome..The main cast and Mr.Bay was returning..Everything was in place..Then the movie started,or should i say the action started..Now i am not the one to quibble about the plot doesn't make any sense or the acting is this and that in this type of movie.Its about fighting robots for crying out loud..and i did grade this flick at 7 stars..No spoilers here..as if you haven't already seen the movie..but i will just list a few observations..(1) For shear spectacle alone see this movie in the theatre!!(2)The ""twins"" that have caused the controversy.They didn't bother me that much..they were more annoying than anything..Jar Jar was much worse!!(3)Two movies in.. i still don't know anything about Tyrese,and Duhamels' characters..give me just a little more with them (4)I didn't know who was who at times..A little clarity at times would been helpful.(but)(5)I knew exactly what i was getting with a Bay sequel..If you have seen Bad Boys 2!!..With more money means more mayhem..SO give him a movie with 200 million dollar budget and prepare yourself!(6)Its almost TOO much movie..and i don't think i have ever said that in my life..(7)Shia,and Tuturro were good(8)Fox was OK..she is still a little green (9) Is it me or did Ramon Rodriguez(College roommate)have a bigger role in this flick than what was intended??? (10) Starscream..LOve that character!! To wrap this up..back to my title. I borrowed it from the WrestleMainia series. A couple of days later i was talking with the buddy i went to see it with and we wondered out aloud in Transformers 3 they should skip the plot altogether and just have AutoBots vs Decepticons in one big cage 2 HR cage match movie.. *And if they did that..I still be in the audience.. just like when i was watching Hogan vs Andre the Giant as a kid in the 80's.."

Sam finds a piece of the Cube from the first one in his pocket and it transport all the Cube's information and the cube in general into his head and he's going to college and he starts seeing images from the cube eventually he founds out the cube is leading him to the matrix a device that'll allow the fallen to consume the sun Sam needs it to bring Octumis Prime alive (who i forgot to mention died by megatron and starscream) and a prime is the only one who can kill the fallen. by the time of the climax a whole bunch of stuff goes down. i didn't say EVERYTHING from the movie because it is too long to explain but for those who says it has too many plot hole A LOT OF GOOD MOVIES HAS A LOT OF PLOT HOLES obviously those haters of this movie didn't pay attention."

"markman99","7","18","32","30 June 2009"," Met my expectations, but did not succeed them like the 1st
","Before I saw the 1st Transformers film I was a doubter, Micheal Bay's reputation as a film director hasn't been ""critic friendly"" to say the least. But I respect him because even though critics give heat for his films, he has made some really good action/adventure films like Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon, The Island, and Transformers. <br/><br/>I'm not going into the plot 'cause I'm sure you've all looked it up or seen the movie. But I want to throw my opinion in because I feel people are either too positive or too negative on this movie, I going to start by giving my pros and cons on the movie:<br/><br/>Pros: 1. Amazing special effects and action sequences. 2. We get to see the history of when/why the Decepticons hate the humans and Autobots (although it isn't rocket science). 3. As in the 1st film, Optimus Prime gives us a reason why he wants to co-exist with humans in order for both species to evolve. 4. We see more Decepitcons/Autobots including one new breed of Decepticon that takes the form to say the least of a horny, sexy, college girl in order to seduce/capture Sam. 5. Megan Fox is hotter than ever (if that was possible). 6. John Turturro and Sam's Parents are back.<br/><br/>Cons: 1. Even though we see new additions to the robot roster we aren't properly introduced to most of them, so at times its hard to tell who's bad or good. 2. Shia Lebouf's charisma has gone down some. He's less nerdy, witty, charming, and a little less interesting, but he is still a good actor and still likable. 3. Tyrese and Josh are given even less lines this time which is a shame because they both are not bad actors. 4. Plot holes! the movie leaves us with more questions than answers. 5. Anthony Anderson isn't back and I sorely miss him. 6. Unlike the 1st which was still relatively okay for kids to watch, this has more innuendo, cursing, and a couple of male genitalia jokes thrown in, I don't mind so much but it certainly narrows the spectrum of the type of audience it aims for. <br/><br/>But this movie disappointed me on some level I can't quite put my finger on, and I'm not talking about the plot holes or the continuity errors, or even the occasion foul language or immature humor, because I don't mind those to a certain degree.<br/><br/>It's all subjective really. But I feel that this movie isn't as nearly as lovable as the 1st. I've seen both movies in the theater and I can tell you that the first one injected a positive excitement in me were I got goosebumps and I really got into the movie. Revenge of the Fallen lacks that certain excitement and heart, which saddens me because its not that bad of movie. <br/><br/>After looking at some of his movies, I came to the realization of where Michael Bay strays from course. Mr. Bay's direction tends to go astray when the budget of the movie is bloated or too high for story or subject matter (ex: Bad Boys II, Pearl Harbor, although the bombing sequence was exceptional, and Armageddon even though I like it) because I think that if the budget is plentiful, and the story is sparse, he tends to focus too much on explosions, quick editing, and kinetic action which is okay with me, but when the plot holes start to grow to astronomical portions I start to get worried, or even worse: bored. <br/><br/>For those of you who own the DVD of the 1st film, in the special features section and commentary Micheal Bay explained that even though T-1 cost roughly $151 million to make, it was relatively inexpensive considering all of the technical advances and attention to detail in the special effects department as well as location shooting, production design, pre/post production, as well as help from the military. Mr. Bay also stated that Steven Spielberg really pulled on the reigns when it came to using the cgi and the budget.<br/><br/>If that's the case, then Mr. Spielberg probably had little or no influence on limiting either the cgi or the money because I see a lot of both here, practically filling every frame of film. <br/><br/>I REALLY liked and still like the 1st one. I'm just hoping that 3rd (and there will be a 3rd folks) installment will redeem all of the mistaken steps this one made. I still have hope for Micheal Bay, I really believed with the 1st Transformers he had or was learning from all his past mistakes, and was starting to refine his storytelling skills. <br/><br/>I saw a lot promise from Micheal Bay in Transformers 1, there is less promise here in Revenge of the Fallen, but I still see promise and hope which makes it all the more frustrating and disappointing.<br/><br/>A+ for effort, B- for execution."
"spcscandle","7","25","47","2 July 2009"," What is wrong with people?
","I don't understand how people are saying there is no plot. Hello, the Fallen wants to destroy the earth! Why does he? Maybe his evil mind was shutout from the Primes and he was rejected and Im sure he blames the humans. Megatron isn't too happy with us either. You cant say its stupid that they borough Megatron back to life, it happened in the cartoon! They named him Galvatron, but Bay couldn't do that because people like you would have one more thing to complain about not understanding. I understood everything that was going on and I loved the fight scenes. It was more than pushing and shoving, I saw a lot of punches and kicks, who didn't? I think you need to take a step back and throw out what critics say and formulate your own opinion. I thought it was hilarious when Simmons was in that thong, the whole audience did. If your saying the twins were racist why? I thought they were funny, if your saying their black or whatever maybe your the racist? I know white people who talk like that, there's no race to be intended except by the puny mind of people like you! This movie exceeded my expectations and I found it fun and eventful and easy to follow I don't know where this whole too much going on is coming from.

","I have seen people complaining about the story and other things wrong with transformers. Me I don't think there's anything wrong with it. Its a movie about giant robots. I enjoyed this movie it showed exactly what i wanted. A bunch explosions and great CGI. I didn't go see this movie to here a bunch of TALK. I wanted to see fighting and explosions for this particular movie and thats what i got. The story was not the best in the world but who cares. Giant robots bet the crap out of each other. Another thing is Meagan Fox. She is hot who cares if her acting is not up to par. She is there for one thing is that is just for eye candy much like the entire movie with all its CGI."
"youngbutstrong01","10","25","47","24 June 2009"," The Best movie of 2009 so far, and it will probably stay that way...
","From the start you are thrown into the action with out of this world action scenes and the best coordinated CG animation that i have ever seen. The Characters in this movie take on a whole new level of personalities, unlike the first one which was more BOOOM! BANG! SWISHHHHH! than actual dialog between the robots themselves. I'm not sure if this movie was a action movie or a comedy. You spend as much time dying with laughter at the sheer hilariousness of this movie as you do clinging to the edge of your seat with your but-cheeks holding your breath and wishing you had a photographic memory so that you could reply that wicked sick combo that bumblebee just did to a decepticon. Great Movie everyone needs to see it once or even twice...i know i will be.<br/><br/>PS: who ever wrote this movie rocks and i'll definitely be looking forward to transformers 3. Although i don't think there's anything left to do that wasn't done in this film. It brings me to tears how good this movie was...."

","I went to this movie on opening night in my city at midnight with a bunch of buddies. The theatre was packed and the anticipation was high. At the end of the movie, not one person was disappointed. This movie was awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>STORY <br/><br/>The story was decent. There was no true flare of creative brilliance but in an action movie like this, it was still quite good.<br/><br/>CGI <br/><br/>The CGI was unbelievable. At times I had to remind myself that the Transformers don't actually exist. Everything (the robots themselves, the way the environment reacted with them, the actors talking to them)was fantastically done and made it seem like the robots were real.<br/><br/>ACTING <br/><br/>The actins was better done in this one. Shia was great in the other one and he is ven better in this one. Megan Fox is beautiful and she has also brought her acting up a notch and I was quite impressed. The other actors did their jobs well. Even the Transformers voice acting was great.<br/><br/>MUSIC <br/><br/>The musical score, written by Steve Jablonsky, was amazing. At times, I focused more on the musical score than the movie (not because the movie sucked.. I loved the movie) it was just that the music was absolutely epic.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was unbelievable! I will probably go see it in again, but in I-MAX this time, later this week. Also, although Micheal Bay has been panned by many people, I believe that this movie proves that he is, in fact, a great director."
"valen060","10","25","47","21 June 2009"," A Film NOT Disappointing At All
","Critics and some average people alike always judge before they actually see an entire movie, but they are just blind to see how this cinematic masterpiece Michael Bay can put together. Bay certainly caught my attention and this sequel to the 2007 live-action adaptation of ""Transformers"" is no exception.<br/><br/>Familiar characters old and new, new storyline, and better character development are what really makes this sequel become a movie worth staying in your seats.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is off to college, yet he is not aware that the battle he faced before is far from over. When new Decepticons come rolling in, it's up to him, his human allies, and Autobots to put an end to their tyranny.<br/><br/>With its stylized action sequences, impressive visual effects, awesome voice actors, and amazing filming locations, Michael Bay has done it again! I'll admit that one of his films in the past was a dud and that very few particular scenes in this movie were not necessary, but Transformers is what defined Bay's directing much further. He should keep up with his signature explosions, that's his edge."

","In Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam Witwicky and in this one the Decepticons try to destroy Earth and along with that the rest of the Autobots. In this one you find out how Optimus Prime is the last one of his kind and what happened to the rest of the primes. Josh Duhamel (Major Lennox) and Tyrese Gibson (USAF Master Sergeant Epps) both return in this one and they are teamed up with the Autobots in a group Called NEST to find all the remaining Decepticons in different Countries trying to hide until NEST finds them. Sam is also off to college and Ron (Kevin Dunn) and Judy Witwicky (Julie White) are trying to face the facts that Sam is growing up. Judy is taking this off to college thing a little more harder than Ron. Mikaela (Megan Fox) is still Sam's girlfriend, but since Sam is going to college they are going to try a long distance relationship to stay together rather then break up. Also returning is Agent Simmons (John Turturro) from sector 7 helps them find and old Decepticon who helps them figure out how to save Optimus Prime to save the world from destruction from the Decepticons. This movie is really action packed and has a lot more action than lines really, but it is fun to watch. Here are also some of the other stars in the movie which are Ramon Rodriguez, Isabel Lucas, John Benjamin Hickey, Matthew Marsden, Andrew Howard, Michael Papajohn, Glenn Morshower, John Eric Bentley, and along with others.

Frankly, this film is just brilliant.

I'm also a huge fan of the animated movie and must admit that I've cried when Optimus dies in the animated movie! What you've got to remember is that this is basically a live action version of the animated original. Therefore is doesn't have to make any sense OR be believable in the real world. It's meant to be a fantasy world.<br/><br/>Also, please leave Michael Bay alone! I love both the Bad Boys movies and his style of direction doesn't bother me at all. In fact it brings much needed energy on screen.<br/><br/>I'd love to see more of the old characters introduced in the next movie like Hotrod, Cup, Ultra Magnus and Blaster.<br/><br/>Go into this movie in the right frame of mind and you'll have a blast.

"sterlingjet","9","16","28","3 October 2009"," FUN , awesome effects
","First off I have to say that the effects in this movie were off the charts. An unbelievable amount of work went into all of that and you have to appreciate it. The movie itself was a lot more action packed than the first and although it was not a master work of art, it was pretty cool. This movie was more tacky than the first, but it also had better action scene's, a better plot and was a lot more intense than the first. To be honest I found the first a little boring but back to revenge of the fallen. If you like action, hot women and science fiction, this film is a must see.<br/><br/>Overall 9 out of ten, because it could have been more epic/ well thought out."
"mikosito","7","16","28","12 July 2009"," Good but not completely satisfactory
","After coming out of the cinema I usually review a movie. What feeling do I have. With this one it was difficult. I mean the special effects were good especially when you see it in Imax. It was certainly entertaining, there were a lot of jokes. But well somehow it also felt hollow. It is much better than the last Terminator. But for instance Star Strek was much better than this one (and I am not a Star Trek fan). I guess it was too long too much action. I liked the first Transformers more even if this one was obviously even more advanced in special effects.<br/><br/>I give it a 7 out of 10 for the amazing special effects and the gorgeous Megan Fox."
"kevin_parks","1","53","110","23 November 2009"," Could not watch after 30 minutes
","It's not often that I don't give a film at least a fair chance. But I could not watch this film anymore after the first 30 minutes. Where to begin? The acting was awful. Megan Fox and Shia Le Boeuf should not be allowed in front of a camera anymore. The plot was... I'm not actually sure there was a plot. The attempt at humour... was aimed at apparently no one. To be more specific: the entire dialogue and acting by Shia's characters mother... drove me insane. Zero point whatsoever to her even being in the film, let alone actually having a lot of dialogue and scenes. The Megan Fox Show aspect of the movie was completely pointless. And how many times could they play that agonizing Green Day song!?!?!? I think they played the song 5 different times throughout the first 30 minutes. The song is horrifying to listen to once.. let alone 5 times.<br/><br/>Considering this film was made in a society that allows Britney Spears and Lady GaGa to have success, it doesn't surprise me that this film was SO terrible.<br/><br/>But it is a shame. Just like they did with Spider-Man... they took GREAT potential, and instead of creating Gold, they created feces."

The name of the movie is Transformers. It is an action movie. A very good action movie,i must say. I recommend a drama movie all who don't like action movies. Or a comedy. Or maybe some soap opera TV serials. These days you can't please anyone. Some say that seeing this movie was a waste of their time,but i think the only waste was that they wrote some shi@y comments. Now that's a shame and a waste.<br/><br/>What I don't like,I don't watch. It is that simple. Maybe watching a trailer could help. <br/><br/>All who watched and did not liked the movie, and now crying about it, are denailing them selves. Because they watched it,and now they are saying to other people not to watch it. That is sad.<br/><br/>Everything is great in the movie. Megan Fox is great,not because she is sexy...just because she is cute :) And knows to act. Also LeBeouf is great. I love all he's movies! This one is no different.<br/><br/>This movie gives a full charged,action packed,blow up feeling.That is the point!Special effect's are amazing!<br/><br/>So. I had no trouble watching and enjoying this film. I am thankful to all who made this film. Very good work. Michael Bay made a fantastic movie! Giving it 10/10 I recommend it to everyone :)"
"truecrimsondeath","8","15","26","28 June 2009"," A SOLID review of this movie!!! (Not just bitching)
","Most of the reviews of this movie were so bad that even me, a die hard Transformers fan, was worried walking into the theater.<br/><br/>Having seen it, I don't know what everyone's problem is.<br/><br/>If you liked the original cartoon, you'll like this. It captures all the elements that made the original series so great. It's not Lord of the Rings. It's a toy commercial.<br/><br/>I guess I'll address some of the main complaints I've heard so far:<br/><br/>-Skids and Mudflap ruined the movie. -They weren't as bad as Jar Jar. No character could be. Sure the movie would have been better without them, but as I recall in the cartoon the humans would mostly hang around the smaller Autobots and at least the twins ones were given a bit of personality (annoying as they were...)<br/><br/>-Soundwave was a disappointment. -I thought it was a good idea to have him as a satellite. It seems like they couldn't quite decide how to portray him realistically yet remain true to his original character and alternate mode. He still does his thing, ejects Ravage from his chest, monitors communications. It was cool to have Frank Welker back in the role although I wish his voice had more vocoder and less Dr. Claw (or whatever that guys name was from Inspector Gadget). Hope to see more of him in #3. Oh yeah, Ravage was pretty cool too. Loved how they gave him his flank cannons like the original toy and cartoon.<br/><br/>-The plot was stupid. -Of course it's going to be a juvenile. It's Transformers. What did you expect. The movie even makes fun of the lack of plot at one point. (...agent Simons talking to Jetfire in the desert).<br/><br/>-Too many explosions. -What do you expect from a Michael Bay film involving a bunch of giant robots with giant guns.<br/><br/>-Too much camera movement and slow motion. -The constant camera movement made scenes that would otherwise be unbearable slightly less so. The slow motion allows you a closer look at the robots which is a good thing. On that note though, it would have been nice to see some more wide shots of the transformations to get a better idea of the complexities involved in the process. It does get hard to see what's going on at times.<br/><br/>-It wasn't as good as the first movie. -100% wrong. It actually corrects many of the problems from the first movie. There is more robot/human interaction and less focus on Sam. The pace is faster and moves the movie along quicker. More classic Transformer names as well. In the end, it left me wanting more but not feeling ripped off. <br/><br/>-Megan and Shia cant act. -Megan is never really given a chance to do anything other than look sexy. Does her character serve any other purpose? No. Who cares. Shia's acting is limited as well, but again who cares. The frantic character he always ends up playing works well in this case. All that Hollywood partying seems to have caught up with him it seems tho. On the IMAX screen he looked about 35 years old. His double chin was the size of my bed.<br/><br/>-Devestator wasn't on screen long enough. -I agree on that one. Would have liked to see more of him (and Demolisher too). My question about Devestator was; if Long Haul forms part of Devestator when he was climbing on the pyramids with agent Simmons then, how could he be in a different place fighting Bumblebee and co. at the same time. I guess the toys had doubles/repaints and even in the cartoon the Decepacons had all those jets that looked the same. Also, the set from the final battle in Egypt looks an awful lot like the middle eastern desert set used in the first movie.<br/><br/>Other notes:<br/><br/>-Most of the Autobot dialog could very well have been lifted from deleted scenes from the first film. You don't hear much out of anyone except from the twins and Optimus. Jetfire was the exception to this, fortunately. His character was great. <br/><br/>-Starscream is more reminiscent of his 80s cartoon counterpart in this installment. In fact all the dialogue in the movie reminded me of the cartoon. Total cheese, but appropriate for a kids movie. <br/><br/>-The CG wasn't as good as the first movie.<br/><br/>-Jetfire has an Australian accent for some reason.<br/><br/>-Transformers now cry, fart and hump legs.<br/><br/>-How did Blackout come back from the dead?<br/><br/>-Cybertron didn't sit right with me. Too barren and moon-like. Some interesting elements there, but too far removed from the cartoon in my opinion. One of the many parts of this movie that remind me of the Matrix.<br/><br/>-Wheelie was a great concept but the voice ruined the character. Whoever was doing the bad Joe Pesci impression was making me cringe.<br/><br/>-Nice touch that they included the insecticons, although unfortunately only briefly.<br/><br/>-I wasn't looking forward to seeing Arcee, but after seeing the film wished there had been more of her.<br/><br/>-The dog humping gets old fast.<br/><br/>-Could have done without the ""robo bug down the throat"" scene lifted directly from The Matrix. Anybody notice Hugo Weaving almost reprising his dialogue from The Matrix in that particular scene as well...?<br/><br/>-Did I see a small sharktacon in the kitchen wars scene? It was just out of the corner of my eye...<br/><br/>Over all, a fun movie. Worth seeing if you want to turn off your adult brain for two hours and escape into the juvenile lore of Transformers.<br/><br/>Check out my Transformers remix at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTSa4l1H8Aw"
"jdkraus","7","15","26","26 June 2009"," Not as good as the first one, but still WOW
","There are only rare occasions, in which the sequel is better than the original. In the original ""Transformers"" I thought the visual effects could not be topped, but its sequel certainly does. The CGI, sound, and sound editing design is amazing, the best I've seen in any movie. However, this doesn't necessarily mean its better in other aspects. If you're expecting an award winning script or Oscar-worthy performances, this is not the movie for you. <br/><br/>The story is interesting, not a bit corny, which is something I give congratz for the writers. The majority of the actors do a decent job. Shia LaBeouf is still amusing as Sam Whitwicky, Megan Fox is sexy as usual as Sam's girlfriend, and John Tuturro is basically himself as the disgraced Agent Simmons who now works in a meat shop. <br/><br/>The film also introduces some new characters, both human and machine. I've heard a lot of criticism aimed toward the new autobots, particularly Wheelie and Skids, both of which supply as the comic relief. Yes, they do speak jive, making it hard to understand what they are saying at times, but it adds to their characters. I personally found them hysterical. There is also new villains which are both frightening and appearance and menacing.<br/><br/>But if any character is considered annoying, it is Leo played by Ramon Rodriguez. He tries to act like Shia in the horny aspect, but for the rest of the film he whines like a baby. At least Shia makes up as a decent protagonist, which Leo doesn't. I was hoping his character would get his comeuppance, which unfortunately doesn't happen. <br/><br/>But there are some other things that I found jarring to this movie. There is a drug reference that is used for a comic effect, but it is way out of proportion to the film. It had no purpose. And there are several unneeded sexual situations that I felt were way too intense for a science-fiction action flick like ""Transformers"". The movie is supposed to be about stuff getting shot up and blown up, not college kids gone wild. That's the ""Animal House"" department thank you very much. And I couldn't help but notice that Michael Bay seems to like showing animals and robots humping each other as well as humans. Again, no purpose, very unneeded. Ten minutes of the film could have been saved from all of these things I have mentioned. <br/><br/>This movie is far from perfect, but it is not horrible as so many people call it. This is not one for everyone. It has great, long action sequences, big explosions, and the best CGI a person could dream up of (at least for now). If you are looking for this in a movie, you are sure going to enjoy it. If not, that's your call. If there is going to be another ""Transformers"" which I think there will be, I'll be in line for it on its opening weekend. <br/><br/>My rating: *** out of ****"
"fredmorton2008","7","15","26","26 June 2009"," A Mixed Bag
","Let it be known. I enjoyed this movie. Loved the first movie but only enjoyed this one. There were some major problems with this one.<br/><br/>Good: -Better action sequences for the most part. -Lennex and his crew are more interesting and their alliance with the Autobots is one of the most interesting parts of this movie. -Optimus kicks even more ass -Despite being borderline racist, Mudflap and Skids are pretty funny. -Shia Labeouf has improved and his character does more. -Megan Fox. Just throwing out there. -Plot was good -Jetfire was interesting<br/><br/>Negatives: -A gigantic lack of character development with many Transformers, even ones we already meet (save for Starscream who does more in this one). There are about four new Autobots (three are like the same, except for colour) who we never get told the names of and there are countless Decepections. We were severally missing the Autobots assembled of number 1 or the Decepections moving(where their names are said). -Megatron bowing to the ""Fallen"". WTF!? -Megatron absolutely getting his ass handed to him by Optimus twice when in the first he beat the sh** out of him. -Devastor dying and his um... metal balls. This rises up to many questions. -Soundwave not doing anything. -Blackout and others returning from the dead with no explanation.(Megatron was explained... a bit)<br/><br/>This seems like a lot of negatives and it is. However, the movie is very enjoyable. The first was one of my favourites. This was good but disappointing. It saddened me that Michael Bay forgot so much about his first movie that he brought back characters from the dead and turn his alpha villain in to some little dog that plays fetch for his master"

","many feel this movie has a not-so-believable storyline. Other feels that there is no storyline. Even more feels that there IS a storyline, but loopholes are everywhere. Lets tackle them, shall we?<br/><br/>1. Not believable storyline - okay, this is a SCI FIC.... If you liked spiderman then why not this? Spiderweb coming out of someone's wrist is absolutely impossible as well! 2. No storyline? Did you leave your brain at home before going to the theater? Hint: Yes. 3. Loopholes? Yeah sure, there may be some. However, if you want the complete story of Transformer... go read the books and fill in what you think were missing.<br/><br/>I honestly feel this movie was extremely entertaining. Who cares if the story is weak? Movies are made to be entertaining, and if sentimental deep dialogues are your cup of tea, you shouldn't have paid $12 to see this in the first place. The explosions and the gunfights were enough for me to watch this movie again (think of it as a firework show)<br/><br/>my only laments for this movie: 1. sexual theme made this not suitable for young audiences 2. decepticons are over-designed 3. cheesy jokes that you normally wouldn't laugh at when you watch this movie alone 4. the audio at the theater was way too loud - though I quickly got used to it 5. if pistols and rifles didn't work on the decepticons in the first Transformer movie, why did the marines use them again this time? In fact, why didn't the navy just spam-use the railgun as it's so effective??<br/><br/>Other than these, a wonderful firework show from beg to finish."
"moselekm","8","14","24","3 July 2009"," Fanastic balance of Humor and Action. FUN MOVIE!
","Okay, I got done reading about a collective 20 or so reviews that put down this movie. I think morons are infesting the internet ten fold these days. Now - I do welcome idiots, they make me feel superior. But why must you fester on a website such as prestigious as this one? Now, let me smother the resulting comments with some simple logic. If you are going to see transformers to see some Fitzgerald epic or a in-depth adult drama, you first of all, need to ensure you never breed. Movie-entertainment was made to make a medium of entertainment even more simple for the lazy and illiterate. If you cannot make the simple differences between let's say - Body of Lies to Transformers series, there is a problem with your brain and I suggest you have yourself checked for tumors immediately.<br/><br/>Transformers is a fun movie. They don't take themselves seriously (which as it would seem many basement-children do). The movie is made for three basic things. Action, Comedy, and Comic-book melody. All of which are great.<br/><br/>The movie is great for fans, (and this is to also reflect away the morons who are incapable of seeing a plot), as they bring back Primus/Unicron/TheOne mythology into the movie. Now they do have some points that are inaccurate - but nothing is perfect. They bring back in (and this is not a spoiler, this is common knowledge to the Marvel Comics Lore set over 24 years ago) the Matrix, the seven Primes, the Fallen, and the constructions. Oh and of course as you may have heard the real deal - Soundwave.<br/><br/>The movie has a great mix of Robot on Robot, Human on Robot, and all that action. The opening sequence does a great job of summarizing the relations on Earth and the new Robots to be starring in the film. Michael Bay and the genius' at the CG studios learned from their earlier mistakes and fixed all the lighting and panel/vector problems to make the robot fights easier to follow and thus way way more epic.<br/><br/>The movie also has a great brand of humor that makes the movie even better. Sorry, if you're to mature to laugh at a stoned mother on a college campus tackling Frisbee-kids, then you need to get a monocle and move to South Africa, because you don't belong.<br/><br/>Again, if you go to see this movie as a moron (read above) then you'll hate this. If you go to see the movie as an Old Transformer fan or simply a person looking for a FUN movie. You will like this and probably suggest it to your non-idiotic friends. And yes, I'd like to take this moment in suggesting over 400 people on this site lack the ability to watch movies as a critic."

This movie had a huge amount of action and comedy. Too many people in this world have such thin skin. Understand that I am totally against racism. The stupid characters in the movie just reminded me of uneducated robots, not a particular race. Remember that there are good and bad in every group. I loved the special effects and plot.

"L_Nyx","5","44","90","29 June 2009"," A heart-breaking disappointment
","The first Transformers completely amazed me, not only by the special effects, but also because the story was surprisingly good and the characters were very likable. So when a second Transformers was announced, following the Hollywood tradition of exploiting every decent movie with a bunch a sequels, I couldn't wait to watch it. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen followed yet another Hollywood tradition, being a very bad sequel.<br/><br/>The story begins with Sam moving away for College, leaving both his beautiful girlfriend Mikaela (hoping for a good long-distance relationship when he cannot even say he loves her) and his robot protector Bumblebee behind and with Optimus Prime and the rest of the gang joining forces with the military on a 'secret' operation to exterminate any remaining Decepticons on Earth (and just how secret an operation be when on the first 10 minutes of the movie half the city of Shanghai is destroyed?). And then it goes on from there with Sam becoming the only key to finding yet another alien machine left on Earth so very long ago and then to the revival of Megatron to his pursuit of Sam through half the world. Sounds familiar? Well, it should. But I was willing to look past the clichÃ©d beginning of the plot in exchange for a better development on the story. It never came. <br/><br/>I left the theater very disappointed. I tried very hard to like it, ignoring the irregularities on the plot, the annoying characters and the too many humping and testicles jokes. But by half way through the movie, I realized that no matter how much I waited, the movie just wasn't going to get better. Fans of the Transformers series will be more than pleased to see references to the show as in the Matrix and other characters like Devastator and Jetfire (even when they weren't necessarily portrayed in the same way as in the series) and even as to how Starscream was finally shown in the movie as the coward he is. But despite all this, the film simply does not deliver.<br/><br/>A highlight of the movie should've been the introduction of new Transformers. Keyword: should've. We were stuck through the whole movie with a pair of ""twins"" that not only were offensively stereotyped, but also contributed with absolutely nothing to the movie. And to prove just how worthless these two really were, first, none of the other characters (either humans or robots) gave them any attention whatsoever and on one scene near the end they are supposedly fighting against Devastator and on the next one, Devastator is making his way to the Pyramid where the sun-destructing-machine-that-makes-Energon is hidden without any of the damage the brothers had made on the previous scene and the twins themselves are not shown or mentioned for the rest of the movie. New human characters? Also, very irritating. The blonde and hot new 'love interest' that turned out to be a Decepticon was, in my opinion, a very stupid addition to the plot. Why would the Decepticons send one of their own disguised as a girl to attend college parties and classes only to seduce Sam when their objective is to capture him, get the info and then kill him? On one scene, the girl simply walks away when Bumblebee (in Camaro form) throws oil at her face when she is alone with Sam. The extending tongue thing she did every on every single shot was also stupid and unnecessary. And speaking of unnecessary, the latino boy added to the 'heroic team' of Sam, Mikaela and Simmons, turned out to be an incredible waste of film that otherwise could've been occupied by other characters that actually contributed something to the film and had very little role in this movie like those played by Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. But when it comes to characters who had more time on-screen than they deserved, it is Sam's parents the ones who take the title. Mom's craziness was sort of funny on the first movie and the first 30 seconds in this movie were sort of okay, but when the Marihuana scene extended like for 5 minutes I seriously wanted a Decepticon to come a blow her head off. And not only with her. It seemed like every scene that involved one character doing something 'funny' (under the screenwriter's standards) went on and on and on. Like Simmons's 'Remember what this man did for his country thing'.<br/><br/>Sure, the special effects and the fight scenes are breath taking, but that simply doesn't make a good movie. And even at some point, the fights got a little bit confusing as far as not being able who were the Autobots and who were the Decepticons. I wanted this movie to be good so bad only to shove it on the face of all those that dared to call the first one bad. But the movie didn't love up to its predecessor. And I know some might say that I shouldn't be criticizing a movie of robotic aliens based on animated series so hard, but I believe this movie deserves it due to how incredible the first movie was. I even dare to say this movie seems like joke of the first one. The movie is ""okay"". I'm sure there are a lot of people that enjoyed it, and I respect that. But the truth is that if you consider the first one, Revenge of the Fallen came off short as of to what it was supposed to be. Let's just hope that if they decide to make the third one (which is very likely due to the huge amounts of money that movie has left the producers), the screenwriters do a far better job on the plot and the director gives the viewers, not only flashy special effects and extended mass-destruction scenes, but also a movie than can live up to the first one."

","Please ignore the comments of people that take this film seriously. Im a massive fan of the first ""new film"" and again the new instalment didn't disappoint, the classic humour from the original cartoons is very funny which had the whole cinema laughing throughout with the on the icing on the cake being the awesome action sequences and amazing looking cars. Don't expect an Oscar performance because frankly your not going to get it neither are you going to get a solid plot line, but thats not the point. Its a sit down and brain off film which its perfect for, a fantastic summer blockbuster. I love it for the same reason i like bad boys 2, again another flawed film but an awesome way to spend a couple of hours. Transformers is a true summer ""blow everything in sight up"" block buster <br/><br/>Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! roll on 2011 for the next<br/><br/>Don't take it too seriously, if you do your a tool."

","Transformers 2 was not as good as the first one but it was a really awesome movie. This one had a lot of excitement, there was no boring parts. It was a little darker, the Decepticons had a lot more screen time in TF2, and Megatron was Beastly, Starscream was better in the 1st one. My favorite part of the movie was Megan Fox and Optimus. Megan is not the best actress, but she's so hot you don't care what her acting is like, so she was enjoyable to watch, Optimus was the best, he kicked a lot more butt in this one than in the first one. He didn't let Megatron throw him around at all. well better see it! if you are a huge transformer fan like me you'll love it!"

","I don't know why all this American people hate this movie. I am a fan of Transformers since school days. they don't know anything about this movie. All I have to say is the 2nd franchise is filled with more action, a good plot, new characters & Shia Lebouf/Megan Fox/Tyresse Gibson makes the movie happen as usual. I am happy to say that Megan Fox plays a good roll and acting than the 1st Transformers movie. Well I don't know what all others who watched this movie is thinking. To tell the truth if someone makes a better movie with a good plot, they know how to insult the people who made it. Again for a bad movie it is all good for them. I think all this European, American's are nut heads. They don't know how to respect people and their hard work. It is a habit of humans that they do not appreciate great work of a intelligent human being. Finally all I have to say is ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is a top class movie with state of the art special effects with a good story. Hope everyone understands that!"

"blubbulb","7","12","20","16 October 2009"," What a blast to your senses!!!
","I must truly say I don't understand what most people complain about. I don't know much of the original Transformers series, but what else can you expect than explosions, crashes, AWESOME animations, awe-inspiring fight scenes... I could go on and on.<br/><br/>I think what did a lot for me was that I was able to enjoy this movie, as well as the first one, which BLASTED me and SO made me long for this one, on an HD computer screen with a decent sound system. It just blasts you! Again and again, one scene after another. The detail of all the transformers is amazing. The camera movements are amazing. Every scene with a Transformer in it could be watched again and again in 1080p and you would notice another awesome detail on them EVERY time you watch them. I'm not kidding. And it's not just the ""typical"" Transformers from the first one, no, there are actually some extremely out-of-the-ordinary ones that I think most fans will love. I certainly did!!<br/><br/>Anyone expecting a deep story or deep characters will be disappointed a little, especially character-wise. But if you're just a fan of AWESOME animations and special effects, or generally love great CGI stuff, this is the movie for you. The point for me also was that the attempt of the background story actually wasn't that bad. I am used to some rather 'flat' stories from video games, and if you can accept that, it's OK. The background-story about Transformers-related stuff is truly epic, just not THAT well-elaborated.<br/><br/>The humor is truly bad at some points, this is why I can't give this movie a 10/10 score. I would love to, but that would be dishonest. There are some jokes in the first 30 minutes of the movie that made me wanna puke. But after that, Bay unleashes a roller-coaster ride of action and awesomeness - this is actually much like in the first movie.<br/><br/>The thing about the two movies is that you feel like you're 12 years old again. All this crashing and exploding and fighting and transforming that is going on just amazes me to a deep and satisfying degree. The WOW-effect of the first scene of the first movie was just AMAZING, and this second movie just tops it again and again and again. I also love movies with deep stories, but this is none of them.<br/><br/>Accept that, await awesome CGI effects, and if you want to feel like you're 12 again - go watch this movie, with the best sound equipment and picture resolution you can get your hands on. It truly is awesome.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>I must add something, now 5 months later. I corrected my rating from 9 to 7. The problem is that the lack of any story or depth keeps me from watching it again after I have seen every animation a satisfying number of times. The movie remains perfect for kids, and it remains perfect for fans of spectacular CGI art, but after a few times you have seen it.<br/><br/>The lack of depth is a problem that's lasting, but the initial WOW-effect from the animations were oh so worth it."
"turock","7","12","20","11 July 2009"," Micheal Bay...What did you expect?
","I went into this movie with very very low expectations, after all majority of Hollywood sequels suck horribly.<br/><br/>That being said this movie is an ACTION film, its story is lacking but I still cant find anyone who can name an actual plot hole. A plot hole is like the scene in the Matrix where Keanu is on the roof and fires all his shots at the agent misses every shot drops his weapons they hit the ground and he says ""Trinity help!!!"" The agent then empties his clip at Neo who dodges almost every shot and gets grazed by a few, as the slow motion stops he falls to the ground along with his weapons that had already hit the ground. Thats a plot hole.<br/><br/>This movie is not perfectly written (feels a bit joggy and doesn't seem to flow naturally) I'll admit that but this is also a Micheal Bay film, if you wanted something more then action and T&A then look elsewhere as this movie is loaded with both.<br/><br/>I originally gave this movie a 10, yes it was a knee jerk reaction but at this time Id still give it a 7 or 8. It does what it sets out to do, there's action, cheesy jokes like in the first movie nice long shots of Megan's bits and pieces.<br/><br/>This movie did what it was supposed too, however I will admit that the Autobots like Ironhide and Ratchet had very few lines :( and the Decepticons lacked introduction and development.<br/><br/>I did enjoy this film but maybe I was not expecting as much as everyone else was. I wanted to be entertained I wanted to escape reality and realism and thats what I got a few hours to kick back and enjoy a film for what it does well."
"Gnarkill1090","Null","10","16","30 September 2009"," Revenge Of The Fallen......amazing!
","I played with Transformers as a kid like most other kids did, Bumble Bee was my favorite. You can guess the excitement I had when I heard they were making a live action movie as well as a lot of other die hard Transformers fan were. I was amazed at the visual aspect and cg effects used in the first movie. I was blown away at how realistic the Transformers looked and how they were able to move flawlessly. The movie concept and action scene were all top notch and went down as a summer block buster movie with good reason. After hearing critics come down on the first one because it was a ""Micheal Bay blockbuster disaster"" I could not believe it. Micheal Bay is an icon for explosions and action movies, some may disagree but hey, its an opinion right? Now, Transformers Revenge of The Fallen, simply marvelous. Totally took every expectation I had for the movie and multiplied that by 10. I first saw the movie in IMAX and was visually stunned! I was in marvel at a 60+ ft Optimus Prime in front of me as if I was in the damn movie or the movie was real life. I believe this is the best cg animated movie ever made, I mean come on, 160 TB of cg effects? That's never been heard of! Even the first one was only 80 or so TG. But, critics again bashed the movie. Saying it was ""A Waste Of 2 1/2 Hours"" and ""Michael Bay should hang up the directing"". This is all the work of self loathing hypocrites who have no better opinion for a well deserved film than to bash it or make it so that nobody wants to see it. I fully disagree with the bashing or mediocrity involving the negative comments towards these two wonder movies. I think Michael Bay did a magnificent job portraying the Transformers and incorporating the small things from the cartoon stories. I am most excited that he will do a 3rd installment of this film and think that anyone else couldn't pull it off."

In short this is one for the fans of transformers, part 1 was great but it did not have the epic battles of this part.It felt like I was watching the cartoon again only better. It brought me back to the days of good guys fighting bad guys with no need for any more information. Thats all I wanted from this film and it delivered exactly that, Bay did a great job, so I wouldn't pay too much attention to those who say its bad, they are just stupid.

","I really disagree with those who did not like the film. I respect the fact that you didn't like it. But come on, the director made a great job in this sequel. Even the story was new, I never thought that the story would be like this. I thought that it would be the traditional storyline of the villain who wants to have his revenge. The script is good. I agree that there some jokes that are completely pointless and added length to the movie. As well as, some weird jokes like farting. But look on the other side, the battles are perfect. Especially the one of Bumblebee, it was perfectly orchestrated, adding to that Optimus Prime's battle against the Decepticons, I have never seen Optimus so strong. Some of the scenes are close and quick, but we got to see the original forms of the robots. If there's something that I didn't like about the film, is that they gave lots of scenes for the army during the battles whilst they could have give the scenes to the other Autobots so they would appear more. At the end, I believe that the movie is one of a kind, and Micheal Bay did a great job. He resurrected the fame of the Transformers"
"dtsakonese","Null","46","95","30 June 2009"," to the critics
","i'm sorry, i must have misunderstood what movie you were commenting on. i was actually looking for a review of the movie ""Transformers 2"", and expected the commentary to reflect a movie based on a children's television program from over 20 years ago. Everyone has grown up since then, but the reason we go to see transformers as ""sophisticated"" adults is to reach back to that nostalgia - this is what we are after. movies are pieces of art that tell a story, sometimes these stories are fantastical/dramatic/philosophical etc., not every movie should have to fit all criteria provided by the movie critics who would prefer every movie to be citizen kane, or the godfather perhaps. in fact, if you went to see transformers and you have something along the lines of ""there was little character development - it didn't move me - the dialogue wasn't what i wanted"" it is you who are the lesser for having complaints when you should have known what you were going to see before you bought your ticket. it's transformers, don't try to make it something else - each movie/book/painting has its place - learn to like things for what they are"
"the_rattlesnake25","4","46","95","20 June 2009"," Boring, tedious, long, and not that much fun...
","Michael Bay's first 'Transformers' film gave the audience an  entertaining blow of knock-out proportions and I (like many others)  left the cinema with a childish grin from ear-to-ear after watching two  and a half hours of robots beating seven bells of scrap metal out of  each other, however the sequel 'Revenge of the Fallen' felt like  nothing more than a soft jab into the abdomen. I didn't particularly  enjoy it, I found it tedious, incredibly boring at times, and apart  from one or two sequences, the action felt very stale and was concerned  more about how each explosion could out-do each other for the extended  destruction of our dear planet.  So I will start by addressing what made the first film so enjoyable for  me; the action! With the colossal budget and the build-up of  how this was going to be 'bigger' and ultimately 'better', I was  expecting a computer generated onslaught of pure, unadulterated robot-o  et robot-o brutality, but sadly only found two scenes out of the whole  two hours and thirty minutes running time that matched the first film  for childish squealing and prolonged smiling of excitement. One came an  hour into the film as Optimus Prime battled his way spectacularly  through a forest of evil Decepticon Robots at a vicious pace, while the  second scene was at the very end of the film as Bumblebee had a very  short, yet enjoyable tussle with Rampage. Aside from these two; battle,  fight, action (what-ever you wish to call them) sequences, Michael Bay  seemed to be more concerned with how he could create larger and louder  explosions with every rocket being fired, or bomb being dropped. The  perfect example is in the drawn out final sequence in which we are  continually blocked from seeing the actual robotic destruction take  place as the screen fills with copious amounts of dust, smoke and sand  due to the amount of explosives being thrown around! With the  entertainment value slightly eroded for myself, I found little joy in  the rest of the film.  From viewing just the first thirty minutes of 'Fallen' I noticed  Michael Bay seems to have somewhat of a penchant for the use of  pointless long-angle shots and slow-motion sequences. If you removed  all the pointless, unemotional, tedious scenes involving the sour  intimate embraces by Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox (which takes the  biscuit in one scene as the camera constantly revolves around both  parties around forty-three times before eventually ending, not only the  most annoying scene of the film, but also my suicide attempt due to  boredom) then the film would be considerably shorter and a lot more  engaging. This is another problem the film comes up against, a running  time at nearly more than two and a half hours, yet it could quite  easily have had at least forty minutes of 'filler' material trimmed  (such as various incredibly unfunny acts involving Judy Witwicky), and  some of the cringe-worthy jokes toned down or removed (however, maybe  it's just me, as some of the jokes did get a good reaction from some of  the younger members of the audience). Oh and there is that much  information thrown at you during the time that the film is on-screen  that you'll be hard pressed to understand everything that is going on,  that is if you are actually trying to follow the plot and the  history/motives regarding the new characters entwined within the Bay  universe.  I went into 'Transformers 2: Revenge Of The Fallen' with quite low  expectations, I wasn't expecting to see a great film, nor was I really  expecting to see a good film from the King of the Cinematic Explosions,  but I was hoping for one thing; to be entertained with violent robots  hacking each other to bits in a blaze of beautiful destructive glory.  But this was unfortunately not fulfilled for me. When I saw Michael  Bay's first 'Transformers' film I was sat on the edge of my seat  throughout as every action sequence made my jaw-drop a few feet, it was  something different and something special, however during 'Fallen' I  found myself for the majority of the film propping my own head up with  my palm, trying to keep myself awake..."
"ice_raven954","1","52","109","3 July 2009"," Bad films succeed when good men do nothing!
","The real problem here isn't that the film was uncontrollably terrible and a complete disappointment to fans of transformers both young and old. Its not the cringe worthy stereotypically raciest characters, or disgustingly sexist voyeurism. Its not the lack of plot, or characterization, or coherency. Its not even the heartbreaking waste of an opportunity that is the problem with this film.<br/><br/>The problem with it is that good men should have stopped it from happening. It SHOULDN'T have been allowed to go this far.<br/><br/>I mean think about it. The amount of pre-production and planning, the number of committee meetings, designs and redesigns, storyboards and shot discussions and script writes and rewrites that would of gone into creating this film would have been gigantic. And rightfully so, there's a lot of money to be made on this. And yet...<br/><br/>Despite what you might be tempted to believe, Transformers 2 is NOT one mans sin. This film isn't Michael Bays sin, its the sin of all of the talented writers and producers and cinematographers and character designers who knew better and said nothing!

If not, then why?) <br/><br/>Similarly, I missed much of Megan Fox's acting because every shot she was in felt like a commercial for a plastic surgeon trying to promote collagen lip injections.<br/><br/>I also felt that the director relied too much on the typical American's lack of geographical knowledge by showing an amphibious military landing near the Pyramids which is impossible if you have actually seen where those great monuments are located.<br/><br/>I think the other negatives of the film have been covered well by other commentaries with whom I totally agree"

","I am a student filmmaker myself. It is important to realize that as a filmmaker we are different from film critics. Now into my review I love Micheal bay's work he has a great vision for his films and this film is no different. It has intense action scenes with mind blowing effects and powerful performances. I loved it from start to end. Each writer on the film has really thought about what to write in terms of making this a bigger picture then the first and it surely is a much bigger picture then the first and a much better picture as well. The casting for the roles is great and the cast did not disappoint me. I must give an extra credit to Isabell Lucas for her performance in her first feature film."
"ajlandt","2","42","87","28 June 2009"," Great if you're a 12-year-old boy
","I went into this movie with moderately low expectations, but sadly I was expecting way too much. I figured the plot would take a back seat to the action and special effects, and I assumed the effects would be great. While I was right on both counts, I was stunned at how painfully long the movie felt - not how long it WAS, as I knew the run-time, but how excruciatingly dragged out it felt as I was sitting in the theater. If I hadn't been at the theater with friends, I would have walked out early on. Regrettably, I stayed for the whole thing. So many of the scenes seemed completely worthless, as they did nothing to further the plot. I was also surprised by the content of many truly inane, tasteless scenes: the mindless, grade-school humor, the borderline (borderline?) racist depictions, the jarring dialogue. These are all sins that can be easily forgiven if one is a pubescent boy. Michael Bay obviously knows his audience; it's too bad I didn't realize in time that I wasn't meant to be a part of it."

","Some of the charms in the first movie are lost in the sequel. But overall this is an entertaining pop-corn movie, more budget and more special effects. You wont mind to pay extra money for that, because it is worth. The robots in the sequel are more humanize, more active, more naughty. Personally I dun like it. In the first movie, they were much more cool and charming. Anyway, Michael Bay,who usually do not care about character development and plot details, make another success attempt to give us an exciting Summer Blockbuster action movie.

I hate it when people say its too long. I bet the same people complain when its only an 1 hour 45 and say its to short.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant I believe, but it does have its flaws. There are a lot of Unnecessary scenes that did not need to be there, which could have shortened the movie, or left more space for some character building on some of the newer characters. Complaints about explosions? I've heard many critics say the trailer looked like an explosion fest, but what on earth would you expect when giant mechanical robots are fighting. Its going to be a lot of big explosions, its not a movie about peace and negotiations. I expect some of the die hard fans not to like this movie, as it probably doesn't follow exactly, to what ever story arc they have taken to adopt this movie from. For anyone else, when it finished, the whole screen I was in clapped, which to me proves that to the average movie goer it is a must see.<br/><br/>There loads of new transformers in this movie, some are signature characters like Skids and Mudflap, the twins, Jetfire and the construct-icons, with many more as well. If time was taken to delve into these new signature characters you would be sat there a lot longer as there as plenty. It is a shame that some feel 'popped in', and i do understand when others cry out for character depth, it is a missing part of this movie, but then the movie would last even longer. Maybe some should not have been introduced? probably but it does not detract that much away from the movie. You still get the big bots out there kicking robot ass, which I loved.<br/><br/>The human element is decent with Shia back as lead, the parents are back too but really should have only been in the start of the movie. There are many light heart-ed, comic moments that I enjoyed, even if i thought they should not be there, they actually fit well. Megan looking as good as ever, not the best of actors mind personally, but she does well. Leo was a slightly unnecessary I thought, and I believe was there for a more comic role then anything else, or maybe to have a future role in another movie with his own guardian like Shia and Bumblebee? Simmon's is as quirky as ever and was nice to see him back. Lennox and his military pals play a very good role as the US military and they really add to the final scenes.<br/><br/>The storyline is clear throughout, or so I thought, its pretty basic to be fair. Keeping to it through the whole movie make have a bit lax, with some of the chopping and changing of what everyone was doing, the story only comes into play in certain scenes, but it is there, and I thought it was a clever one to have as it may lead to a sequel or hopefully will! There are some some major points scored for some areas of the plot, when you see it you will know, i'm not here to spoil anything! This gets 8 of 10 for me, the reason I gave it 8/10 was due to some of the scenes been a tad pointless as they were really not needed, and just seemed to be there to fill some space, but even so most of the time they were pretty comical. Critics complained last time about, there not been enough Optimus, or robot fighting, then when Bay does what they ask he still gets slated for doing to much, he cant really win. It is a popular franchise to try and get right, the die hard fans may not like it, I did I used to watch the cartoons and loved seeing some of my favourite characters back on the big screen. It is a must see for anyone in my opinion even if its just to satisfy your curiosity. For those that know a bit about the transformers world, and the average movie goer it is a definite must and you will enjoy it.<br/><br/>This is my first review, and I hope it helps those waiting to see it, I have to tried to show flaws of the movie and make it unbiased, but I did really enjoy watching it so I found it hard to rip to pieces like others do."
"akallevi","1","42","88","12 July 2009"," Not up to snuff for a director that he should be
","It would seem that Michael Bay is looking to get into the soft-porn industry with this production. What ever floats your boat Mike, but keep it out of your commercial releases please. The film jumps around and has conflicts with the plot. All he relies upon is CGI and a low-cut tight shirt on the starring girl. I used to look forward to his films but now... I will be more discerning. Mikes become a pop-director who likes his product placements and his royalty checks. He's a sell-out who doesn't care about quality anymore. I question if he ever really did want to make a decent movie. And it would seem that Hollywood screenwriters are still in jr high and the palms must be hairy by now."

The storyline was simple but they added more action, more visual effects, more comedy and more of everything to it. It was just enormously entertaining and they couldn't have made a better film. It was definitely a great movie and a must see. There were people around who didn't even wait for the movie to finish to say that they have to watch it again.

"Vultural","1","34","70","26 June 2009"," Explosions, sexual exploitation and racial stereotypes.... all in a days work for Michael Bay
","2007's Transformers was a pleasant surprise. Sure, it was a shallow action film with a severe lack of attention to it's plot, and yeah sometimes it was hard to tell who was fighting who but the film still had it's charm. As long as you switched of your brain for the duration it was an enjoyable film. 2009's counterpart on the other hand ramps up absolutely every aspect of the original in what Michael Bay seems to believe will make a better film. It doesn't! In fact it removed any charm and instead created a crude, non-sensical mess of a film that isn't far from the worst ever.<br/><br/>I'll admit on viewing the film i wasn't expecting there to be a plot that would challenge me or ask any deep questions, but the least i would expect (from this and any other film) is a cohesive plot that keeps me interested. Instead the plot floundered, at many points in the film plot threads would simply disappear with no explanation, as a result i found myself uninterested in why or what the characters were up to. <br/><br/>The absolutely abysmal editing contributed to the complete lack of cohesion in the film. There were many moments where i found myself double taking, unable to make the connection between one shot and the next. The best example of this is during a car chase through a village in Egypt, Witwicky and co. in one shot are driving through the village with the police hot on their tale, the next is a shot with Fox wearing a Burka.<br/><br/>I had similar disdain for the characters in the film. Witwicky was no longer the charismatic character he was in the first film. Megan Fox was reduced to a sex symbol and nothing more. Meanwhile the robots themselves (which the film professes to be about) had little to no characterisation. It was the twins however that i found particularly troublesome, while not going as far as saying they were racist and far from being offended myself, i would have to point out that if someone was to be offended by the characters they have a very strong case. As for the the humour they bring to the film the two characters contribute as much to Transformers as Jar Jar Binks did to Star Wars. In the end i found that i was wishing that the Fallen would just destroy the Sun so i didn't have any of these characters ever again. <br/><br/>One small point of praise on the character front that i would like to express is the added development of Starscream, an interesting character from the cartoon who was much maligned in the first film and is finally given some good and faithful screen time. <br/><br/>In spite of all of the negatives i was expecting to at least enjoy the action and the humour, it turned out that Bay couldn't even pull that off. The first action sequence of the film demonstrated some promise, however this was short-lived, from then on in Bay just throws explosions and metal at the screen expecting it to excite. Bay's complete lack of understanding for the importance of plot is demonstrated in the final showdown where the audience are given 20 minutes of explosions which contribute little to the plot, whereas the final fight with the Fallen, supposedly the villain of the piece, is killed with ridiculous ease. The humour on the other hand can be summed up by dogs humping, farting and THAT MOM! In short it was the sort of humour i would expect to see in Date Movie.<br/><br/>I cannot claim that it was a wholly horrific experience. The obvious respect for the work on the special effects needs to be expressed, similarly i would like to mention the brilliant work on the sound in the film. Other than that i would have to say that this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen, it is the kind of brain cell destroying rubbish that i am worried will soon dominate cinema and that is the reason this film is one of the privileged 10 films that i will ever give...<br/><br/>1/10"
"come2whereimfrom","1","39","82","21 June 2009"," Transformers: No really not fit for human consumption.
","I wasn't going to even bother to review Michael Bay's latest xenophobic robot orgy but how could I not review the worst film of all time? Yes you heard right straight in at the top of my chart for worst film ever made is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen a film (and I use the term very loosely) which I can only describe to you by saying imagine the Muppet show starring huge overcomplicated robots re-enacting American Pie, with explosions, lots of explosions. Two hours too long and never quite sure what it wants to be the film is a cobbled together mess of toilet humour, effects and very little in the way of plot and it even seems to have transformed Megan Fox into some sort cheap soft porn star all fake tan and pouted lips that's are never without a ton of gloss. Sam is back as the reluctant hero/nerd who's parents have gone from being really annoying to 'oh my god why doesn't one of these robots just stamp on these idiots'. Just like having the option to view recently released DVDs of 3D films in either 2D or 3D there should be an option to watch this film at half speed just so you can actually see what the hell is going on, the camera just cant seem to stay still for five minutes, my god what am I saying that would make the film even longer. With a budget that could save a third world country from starvation its easy to see where it was all spent as everything from Sam's house to the pyramids is blown to smithereens and then blown up again for good measure, in fact after about thirty minutes of flattening Egypt I was wondering if there was anything left to level? But, ever the trooper, Michael seems to find a constant supply of things to reduce to rubble. Wearing its right wing views like a badge of honour, Transformers manages to disguise its American bombast in all the confusion, but look closely and you will see that Optimus Prime with his Red, white and Blue colours is leading a team against the Decepticon terrorism threat, all of whom are dark and gravely voiced I could go on but it already seems like I'm wasting my time and I already did that by sitting through the damn thing. Needless to say that there are so many things wrong with this film that I could write for days, like how they nicked bits from other films i.e. Terminator, how the oldest Transformer (who is Scottish for god knows what reason) can jump through space but none of the newer models can and why the giant Transformer needed a huge pair of metal Testicles? I kid you not. Two days after I witnessed this and I still feel violated, all my senses feel raped and I still cant quite believe how utterly utterly pants this overblown waste of celluloid was. The first one was bad and so I went in with very low expectations but even so Michael 'I'm a violent sex starved patriotic boy trapped inside a man's body in a creepy way' Bay managed to leave me completely speechless, well until I felt the anger well up enough to start telling anyone who would listen that under no circumstance should you ever ever put yourself through this torturous ordeal."
"Golgothae","1","36","75","23 June 2009"," Bay drives the last nail hard into the coffin
","I will make this short. The movie is 2 1/2 hour long. The plot is close to retarded...sure, it sounds retarded to say that about the world of transformers which is in itself rather silly. But just like Batman, this could have been made intelligent and good. This is a good no-brainer action movie..sure. The first one actually worked. But the second..gawd!<br/><br/>Plot holes are plenty and it's rather strange when the story is as thin as it is. You'd think it wasn't THAT hard to write something close to logical. Nitpickers will have a good time with this. Megan Fox is insanely hot though, she is the ONLY reason to watch this movie.<br/><br/>If there is going to be third Transformers movie, let someone who actually can take the time to read through the comics make it and make a robot design that you can distinguish from each other... and not make it into another aliens attack humans movie...<br/><br/>If there is going to be more Transformers movies, start it over.

","Summer is here which means a lot of kids who want to watch things get blown up to take their mind off upcoming exams. I can understand that. Sadly there is no excuse for making an incredibly long (longer than Apocalypse Now Redux) explodathon. Dull, boring uninspired just like the first one. If you prefer style over substance you will like it which is why the highest votes were from women under 18. Strangely one would think a film about robots would get higher votes from males. But anyway the fact majority of votes are 10/10 means that they are the type of person to be blinded by the shiny lights. Surprise, surprise that people who liked the first film will see the sequel.<br/><br/>These types of explodathon movies are why films such as Terminator Salvation are so awful.

","I didn't think a film could be any worse than the first Transformers stinker, which destroyed in one sad Hollywood bomb a franchise for which I had fond memories. I didn't think the shameless corporate advertising and abominable military propaganda from that film would be repeated. Then I remembered having seen 4.2 minutes of Pearl harbor (completely by mistake; I was waiting for my tires to be rotated) and shuddered.<br/><br/>Yes, Michael Bay can make worse cinema than the first so-called Transformers film.<br/><br/>And so he did. I have never before witnessed such trite and random comic relief than what this film offers (OK, a middle-aged woman whining that things suck? the same woman repeatedly using adolescent curses? the WWE-style trash-talking between robots?), and I had no idea you could pack hundreds of instances of such superfluous nonsense into just one instance of cinema.<br/><br/>If that's not enough to put you to sleep, add in about 35 minutes' footage of robots transforming. Sorry; not interesting. Not even a 2-year old will remain engaged after the first drawn-out alteration. I know this for a fact; mine fell asleep 7 minutes into the film. I joined her for about 20 minuted at the beginning of the second hour and was very ticked off to find I hadn't missed anything.<br/><br/>I won't go off on the military recruitment propaganda anymore - if you're too stupid to see through it yourself that's your problem.<br/><br/>The final word on this film: good thing I stole it. No single person is more deserving of having his 'art' stolen than Michael Bay, and no studio deserves to sell one less ticket than Paramount for having allowed such utter trash to be distributed to the public."

Sure, it did have some plot holes and some annoying new characters but overall, it's a must-see for any Transformers-fan like myself. The effects and fight scenes, especially the big battle in Egypt, are all very spectacular. Coming from Michael Bay, that's saying a lot to me. I never thought he could pull off a sequel that would be as good as the originals. Although I still adore the first movie, this is an excellent entry into the series.

I found myself enjoying this film. People disagree with the addition of the funny twins, stating that they took away the true seriousness of the movie, but in my opinion i think they provided a comic relief that was seriously lacking in the first. Now I'm not saying that this movie is better than the first, the first is undoubtedly better. I think what people don't understand is the fact that this is not a movie meant for an Oscar, but a movie meant to entertain people and keep them entertained throughout the duration of the film, i know it kept me entertained and i enjoyed it.

Within the first five minutes or so, the autobots were using such language as ""hell"", ""G--Dam--"", ""bit--""; totally unnecessary for the type of family movie this was supposed to be.

","Let me first start of by saying if you enjoyed the first transformers movie, you're more than likely to enjoy the sequel. The same goes for those who are fans of the mythos.<br/><br/>With all that said I feel this movie has received too much criticism. If you've seen the first then your expectations should be in line for the second one.<br/><br/>On to the movie itself... It's bigger, louder and more obnoxious this time around. At times there's so much going on it seems like I missed a movie in between revenge and the first. It really feels like the ending to a trilogy than the middle.<br/><br/>The CGI is great, but Bay added TOO Much to this film. It's like quadruple the first as far as roster of actual transformers as well as the types included in this film (such as insecticons and constructicons) The biggest negative I have for this film would be some of the bad taste in humor. The twins with their gold teeth, street slang, and foul tongues really made me cringe, especially with all the kids in there. It really takes you out of the film when you hear a supposedly sophisticated alien life form saying the word p*ssy. Forthmore, the big robot that you see in the trailers sucking up the sand has testicles which are represented by 2 wrecking balls.<br/><br/>Completely unnecessary humor aside, the movie is a lot of fun!"

I appreciate them where ever I see them and I have since I was 5 or 6, but for different reasons of course. If suddenly making it past 15 made them no longer enjoyable to see, well, where's the fun in that?<br/><br/>These two live-action movies are a different continuity from any thing else that existed before them. What would you expect, a live-action exact duplication just so you can say, ""Oh okay, now I know how that looks as live-action rather than as mere animation or a drawn panel!""?<br/><br/>Am I the only one over the decades who has realized that aspect of adapting from one creative format to another?<br/><br/>This movie showed me things I've enjoyed before in movies and things I hadn't seen before in movies. I give it a 9 out of 10, to account for the minor flaws. But other than that, I do recommend it and I look forward to the DVD & Blu-Ray Disc releases."
"djeb2004","7","11","19","10 July 2009"," Fun Movie, good action, Terminator was better
","Well I would have to say the first Transformers was pretty damn good and seeing the trailer for the second one showed that they are trying to up the action level and maybe explain the story a little better. Well they do this OK. Its not what I expected. I did enjoy this movie. It was very fast paced, with extremely well done special effects. Sometimes the story got a little out there, which unfortunately you do think about it watching the movie. Most times you would like to think back after you've seen the movie to review the story, well that doesn't happen so don't be surprised if you start to review the movie before its over. The characters are mostly just there. The only person you really care about is Sam because well he is the only real character in the movie. Megan Fox seemed way way too fake in this movie. Just watching her makes you think she is a total b*tch in real life. She was only eye candy in this movie. Again the special effects are top notch in this movie. They were about the same professional wise as terminator salvation's were. It did seem sloppy at times and it was hard to tell who was fighting who and who really to root for. That didn't distract me too much. The only two things that bothered me the most about this movie is its split audience attraction. With the 2 gangster robots and there dialog and childish behavior you would guess this movie would be PG. Then all the sudden the robots would start cussing and swearing and talking ghetto. The movie would start to look dark and evil and move to its PG-13 rating. It didn't stay consistent all the way through. The second thing that bothered me was the cliché's of right place right time in every instance in this movie. There would just happen to be the ""right"" missile on a ship that just would happen to be close to where the action was. They would all be prepared to handle this unexpected and unlikely event. You knew Optimus was going to live again to see the final climactic battle yet the battle was short and pretty pathetic and expected. Now I did like this movie and sequels are hard to be as incredible as the first movies. Its rare to see newer movies these days that can be moving and worthy as some of our past classics that are available to us. I would say that many people are going to hate this movie and many people are going to love it. Me... I like it, nothing incredible nothing horrible, just there for me. I thought between to two summer blockbusters Terminator Salvation was much better but thats just me. I give it a 7 out of 10 because for what it is... it does its job I guess."
"barrys82","8","11","19","9 July 2009"," Exactly what I expected
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the biggest box office blockbusters of the summer. From the very beginning of the movie you are surround by big explosions, spectacular persecution and tons of special effects. The story doesn't contribute with many innovations, in fact I feel that it follows the same plot as the first one, The Auto-bots and the Decepticons in their eternal war and the humans in between with Sam Witwicky and his girlfriend Mikaela trying to save the world. Maybe the only novelty in the film is the new robots like ""The Fallen"", the twins and others. The special effects are awesome and the CGI is amazing. The cast is really good, Shia LaBeouf repeating as Sam Witwicky was good, in this movie he is more like an action hero. Megan Fox looking extremely hot and with a decent performance. John Turturro was very funny. In conclusion, this sequel of Transformers is quite entertaining and surely it will be a blast in the box-office."
"bsewart","1","32","67","23 June 2009"," It takes 2.5 hours to fit this many cliché's
","Let me begin by saying that I really liked the first Transformers film. I knew it was stupid action nonsense, with children's humour and lots of explosions, but something about it just made me let go of my judgements and I loved it. I didn't come into this film expecting that I would love it, I knew it would just be a cash-in on the already popular franchise, but I had no idea how bad it was going to be.<br/><br/>Lets begin with character development. Michael Bay seems to have forgotten this needs to be done for people to identify with or care about characters at all. Most of the new transformers are just thrown into the movie, and it's like you're supposed to know them already. Main characters have lost any 3 dimensional qualities they did have in the first film, and have become walking clichés (Megan Fox's character took a particularly savage beating from the writers). Perhaps the most shameful of all would be the changing of Optimus Prime's character. The cool thing about Optimus is that he was the quiet and rational leader, who could deliver some grade A badassery if needed. In this film, he's reduced to a series of one liners, and constant anger.... I'm not even joking.<br/><br/>The story follows on from the first film (sort of) and a shard of the all-spark left over from the evens of the first movie is being guarded by the army (don't remember there being a shard left at the end of the first movie, but screw continuity). I won't ruin too much of the storyline, but Sam finds a shard of the all-spark in his clothing (highly likely) and the cube's knowledge is transfered to him, making him the Predacon's primary target. Now, I'm no expert on the matter, but machine's, being cold and calculating and all, should be able to complete a task without letting stupidity get in the way, but the Predacons manage to cheat themselves out of victory in a variety of ways, including Megatron failing to kill Sam because he wanted to torture him first. WHY WOULD A ROBOT WANT TO TORTURE SOMEONE RATHER THAN COMPLETE ITS OBJECTIVE?<br/><br/>The only good part of this film were 2 action sequences, other than all the other action was a haze of moving coloured metal and slow motion. Most of the fight scenes were actually hard to watch, because I just couldn't actually tell what was happening. Also, I hate to mention it, because I usually don't care about such things, but the running time is appalling. The film hits 2.5 hours, which would be fine if it had valid content for that time, but it's all just filler. It's pretty much 1.5 hours of army recruitment advertising (Michael Bay has an erection for the military), then some action sequences with some poor comedy thrown in to make up the rest.<br/><br/>Don't see this film. I signed up on this site just to tell you to not see this film. I know you may like pretty colours and moving shapes but seriously, take a step back and realise for a second that you are a functioning human being, you have a brain, and you shouldn't let it be exploited by someone appealing to the lowest common denominator. Try not to fall into that category."
"speakeasyX","2","37","79","29 June 2009"," Ha! 'Haters', Eh?
","This movie, more or less, was a waste of a decent popcorn-fodder film. It was disjointed, sophomoric and should not have been able to receive a 'PG-13' rating from the MPAA.<br/><br/>Bay clearly has a fondness for our Military, and for that, I am thankful. And there were a few interesting moments on the outset of the film, but they were quickly overshadowed by oversexed college students, silly, sophomoric humor that was all but devoid of taste, and sub-par writing delivered by even worse 'acting'. Bay knows how to blow crap up, and do it well. But wow, did he drop the ball with this one.<br/><br/>The silly thing is that one even has to say these things about a film like this. It's a movie about giant robots from a planet called Cybertron. One should not even have to comment on a film like this in such a way. That's what makes the film such a sad state on the affairs of Hollywood today. That one has to point out the crude, tasteless, pointless film-making of a movie about a Hasbro toy.<br/><br/>Hollywood, shame on you for making a film that should be fun and a nice escape into something that any sane parent with half of a brain will have to seriously consider (and I hope, decide against) whether or not to take their children (13 and up) to see.<br/><br/>I'd rant about the film more. But really, do I have to? I think anyone thinking clearly could understand within minutes that 'Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen' was not only a waste of time, but a waste of a fun idea.<br/><br/>Too bad."

","There i was in the theatre with a large coke and a bag of popcorn. I wasn't particularly blown away by the first movie, but it had great special effects and a somewhat decent plot. I figured: if it's on the same level as the previous flick i will surely enjoy myself.<br/><br/>Movie begins. Chase on the freeway. Megan Fox on bike. Explosion explosion, explosion. ""Wait a minute... what's happening here?"" Cheap joke, explosion explosion explosion. ""Eh.... Who's who? What are those robots fighting about? How did those parents end up in the desert? Is there a plot?"" Then my eyes forcefully closed and i dozed off. The movie was boring.<br/><br/>I really wonder why they couldn't stick to the basic idea of the cartoon. The cartoon had two factions: autobots and decepticons. Each faction had equal screen time. Once in a while the story would switch to the other side by means of an autobot logo switching to the decepticon logo (or and vice versa). The story centred around the robots and not around the humans. The humans were caught in the middle of the fight against their will, and were being protected by the autobots. Why are these movies so different? So, don't see the movie unless you need a good few hours of sleep."
"roninred","Null","34","72","24 June 2009"," Pure Military Propaganda, and Racist to Boot
","SPOILER ALERT! Did people in Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan ever look at the movies they were watching and recognize that they were watching propaganda? Similarly, will American movie-goers recognize military propaganda if they see it, despite it being dressed up with transforming robots and Megan Fox's substantial assets? Well, if you see this movie, you are in for a two+ hour test case in just such a scenario. Featuring all four branches of the U.S. military (amazing how they can spare the time when we are in the middle of a war on two fronts), the story of Transformers tries to fit itself around the central role of the military and disappoints entirely. Somehow, in between the shots of fighter jets in formation peeling off, troop carriers landing on the shore, tanks shooting their missiles, and enough aircraft carriers to make Ex-President Bush, Jr. weep with joy and want to cry out ""Mission Accomplished!,"" this film asks the audience to suspend disbelief and ""bah"" like sheep. There is practically no plot line, little character development, and only that sense of unease that you get watching the army recruitment commercials that play before the movies start, knowing that there is nothing heroic about coming back a paraplegic or with arms missing, only to face a VA administration that couldn't give a rats behind about your well-being. Even further, as if to drive home the point of this recruitment video, they stage a great deal of the action in the Middle East (Jordan, Egypt), giving us glowing depictions of how the military forces fight in desert conditions. ""Hoo-rah"" indeed.<br/><br/>In fact, this movie did clear up my questions about the first Transformers movie in new ways, however. In the first movie, I had always wondered why the plot had seemed so disjointed, as if there were two stories at odds with each other. Now I understand that the issue was that there was one plot line with the U.S. military (which brings in some tough guys to balance out uber-dork Shia LeBeouf) and one plot line that actually had to do with the Transformers, LaBeouf and Fox. Sadly, in this sequel, the latter is sacrificed for the former, with the unsurprising result that the story gets whittled down to the plot line of a music video. A music video that lifted its soundtrack straight from, you guessed it, military recruitment commercials.<br/><br/>Even further I didn't believe that you could make robots racist, but somehow they have managed to do so again. Again, you may ask? Well, referring to the first movie, there was Jazz, the hip-hop robot, who is coded as African American, and who, true to movie stereotypes, is the only robot that gets killed. In this sequel, they introduce us to Skids and Mudflap, two robots that are also coded as African American, are continually fighting with each other (a metaphor for urban black-on-black violence), and are functionally illiterate in robot script. And they even have large ears as if taken from a caricature of Will Smith or dare I say, President Obama. I never thought robots could be racially offensive, but it just goes to show that anything is possible. Cheers to Michael Bay for an all time low! All told, the story if crap, the characters are nonexistent, the jingoism is on full throttle, and I am out of $15 and feel like my intelligence has been insulted in new ways. Hopefully, if you have read this far, you can save yourself the damage. Refuse to see this crap, see it on rental, or wait till it comes out on TV. You won't be missing much."
"rubenjongejan82","1","36","77","15 July 2009"," Where has your wonderful creativity gone gentlemen?
","To start of with, I really enjoyed the first Transformers movie. I enjoyed it so much because it had a really good combination of jaw-dropping action scenes, a storyline that was fun to follow and all the actors seemed to have parts that made (enough) sense in one way or the other. There are a few parts which I wouldn't mind taking out but I can actually watch that movie over and over again.<br/><br/>Having said that, I was really looking forward to see Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. But wow,how disappointed I was. I could not believe that Michael Bay and especially Stephen Spielberg had gone that much downhill. It's almost like they were thinking: 'Hey, let's throw out anything that has substance, moral or anything that makes sense for that matter. Let's just fill this movie with a whole lot of fast moving action and half-naked women. And let's make those women run around like mindless lust-objects'.<br/><br/>So I'm not just deeply disappointed in the movie. I am mostly disappointed in the people behind the movie who only seem to care about making a quick blockbuster without spending any thought on what message they are sending out with this kind of movie, especially towards teenagers. Where has your wonderful creativity gone gentlemen? <br/><br/>Looking back on it, I wish I didn't watch the whole movie. Actually, I wish I hadn't seen it at all. So my advice to you is to avoid this film completely. Hopefully this will teach the producers a lesson so that they will come up with a part 3 which can redeem this bad excuse for making a quick buck."

","A Transformers movie needs action!<br/><br/>This movie gets more bashing and trashing in the action scenes. You get to see your favorite characters and new ones who really come to do more comedy.<br/><br/>The particular thing which makes me not give it a 10 is making some specific parts more R rated than usual. I guess there was a need to show an additional talent but some people deserved to return. This specific part let me down because you put a mediocre actor like the so-called Presidential adviser. Jon Voight did not return, the Australian actress who was the hacker team head did not return and the black comedian who shouted to his grandma to drink her prune juice neither. You added more simple characters and they made the movie not go well.<br/><br/>The other part is that there was more improvisation. But you had Bumblebee talk then not... among other quirks.

For all those who didn't like this movie yall aren't true fans of transformers and yall shouldn't even be commenting on something yall know little about.

Another thing if you don't like transformers why did you watch it and come on here giving a bad review go watch G-force maybe thats more your style. I loved this movie Micheal bay did a wonderful job the special effects were top notch and this was transformers at its truest form coming from the original transformers and not changing to make it more like these idiots like it.

"Gramcracker64","9","10","17","22 July 2009"," Strange Film
","Peter Travers gave this film zero stars. It has been almost universally panned. Panned by critics everywhere . . . The movie earned $500 million worldwide as of yesterday. What it is, is not easily known. It is a strange film. The pacing is so relentlessly frenetic and certain. Everything falls according to law. The message of the film, if one should choose to believe there is one is not even known by the film itself; that is to say it, as a film, has no awareness of itself. Every scene is vividly and painstakingly detailed. We are immediately presented with two distinct worlds. A kid going to college and an intergalactic dispute involving two rivals of a robotic alien race. There is not a dull moment in the film. It jumpcuts through ludicrous transitions. Everything is over the top. The stereotypes are overblown. If you have not seen Megan Fox, you will not forget the way she was introduced to you in this film. It also possesses an unmistakable 80's feel while also seeming like it came from the future. Everyone is intense, paranoid and certain. Every scene is some completely different venture. It falls into bizarre, hypnotic, Dawson's Creek sequences. Everyone in the movie is on stimulants. One thing that took me my surprise was how committed the characters were to this alternate reality. Some evil robots called Decepticons are trying to obtain a dark artifact on earth to revive their old earthbound ancestors, hence, the ""fallen"". Meanwhile, Optimus Prime and the Autobots are hunting for the last of the Decepticons and trying to protect the artifact. The immense detail and variety we are presented with in this film places it on a separate pedestal. There are goodies everywhere. We are made to understand the story, and there isn't a single bit that slips by. I am truly perlexed as to what sank this film in the minds of intellectual America, i.e., the critical elite, and how they failed to see the sweeping clarity of the ideas and what the whole picture is. The movie has a strange, supernatural relevance and I would not be surprised to see it become a cult classic. There are just too many great lines, insane ideas, outrageous reactions, society commentaries and amazing robot battles. It's also funny and the humor in the movie is just, what is the word? Yes, that's the strangest part of the movie: the humor. The range of jokes and events we are presented with, electric shocking, moms banging into hanging pots, lines like, ""Whoa. We shouldn't share stories with each other. Ever."" not to mention, ""I'm under the scrotum!"" and an appearance by John Turturo who was the last person I ever expected to see in this film and had no idea was going to be in it. Rainn Wilson, also (Dwight from The Office) has a turn as a smarmy lecturer who says ""I have reached the climax of my lecture."" The cinematography. It flows at a strange pace. It's always perfect. Too perfect? On topic. Too commercial? One huge commercial? Do you know those commercials you see at the beginning of movies at the theater for Pepsi or some other company that has enough to spend on a feature budget? This film looks like that all the way through. This film is 9 different films spliced into one. It rambles down a bunch of pathways a long way. There is a Methamphetamine quality, or Adderall tone to it. The focus is so sharp and unwavering. Optimus Prime is the great American. Red and Blue with white eyes. Turns into a truck. This movie catapults so far into bizarre territory that any review of it by current standards would not make any sense. It is one, long, continuous epic American commercial for America itself, but I think it plods into a new consciousness that is as terrifying to get used to as some of the robots themselves. The detail and thought and consideration that went into this film adds up to something that explains something larger than life. It is like an endless infinity Pepsi commercial. The exaggerations, the puns, the absolutely bizarre dialogue. This is not a normal movie. This is not a summer blockbuster, although it was masquerading as one. The movie strikes at the heart of everything, on all cylinders, and when it's over, it's done. It didn't forget anything. I have read many other reviews of this movie, baffled as to how anyone came to such conclusions. I think over time many prominent reviewers will recant and write a new review. As for an explanation of such a violently divided movie experience, I can only suggest it is something to do with consciousness. The widespread reaction to the film is as peculiar as the movie, and sometimes applause is not all an indication of success. But there is a wild artistry and current of madness and abandon running through this picture. It's markedly different. It is succinct and separate from any other film in its neighborhood. It tries a crazy thing. I should hope prominent reviewers such as Roger Ebert and Peter Travers watch the film again and write another review."

I love the first one so I was anticipating something just as exciting and just as loud and complicating, and complicating as in you gotta keep your eyes peeled for every robot combat.<br/><br/>However, this one has its flaws. If you read an article about Transformers' plot holes, then you'll get what I'm going for. There's so much going on in 21/2 hours that you'd just wish for it to be over. The first hour or more is about Sam going to college while his girlfriend Mikaela is at home working in the shop with her outta-jail pop. Sam discovers a fragment of the destroyed All Spark Cube and discovers that it's done a major mind blowout on him, causing the Decepticons to go on a frenzy to bring back Megatron, who wants to bring back the mysterious Fallen, who wants to take over Earth and wipe out the human race.<br/><br/>The movie isn't that bad, but despite that original director Michael Bay had directed, this movie is like watching the first movie over and over again: a lot of metal smashing, car chases and big ol' scary Decepticons with their devil red eyes and Bumblebee's inability to speak, which you'd think would be solved after the end of Transformers.<br/><br/>Either way, this movie is only an 8/10."

I nitpick on every little detail I notice in a movie/story So (in 2007) for the first Transformers I had huge expectations!<br/><br/>I thought it would have a story at par with the G1 series.(not a great plot but a simple story). I thought I'd be able to recognize all of the transformers and have a blast with the movie. But the lack of any kind of story (allspark? are you kidding' me) and confusing transformers (except Optimus/Bumblebee), I was disappointed by the first part. <br/><br/>So for Revenge of the Fallen I lowered my expectations and focused on the primary transformers (e.g. Optimus/Bumblebee/Megatron). I went in the theater and this time I DID have a blast! :)<br/><br/>Action was great (they actually Slow-mode parts, I think, to show which Transformer we were looking at) ;-P Story was better than the first part.(Like I said my expectations weren't that high this time around)<br/><br/>Sure I still had some issues: like how come the Fallen was never mentioned in the first part(He should've been around on mars too, right? if not were did he come from?). How can Starscream be in charge of everything if the fallen is Megatron's master? and the somewhat annoying twin bots. But because of the low expectations, I wasn't bothered much by it.<br/><br/>Action was good...Megan was hot...Shia was OK....Optimus Rocked! I think real fans will appreciate/enjoy this part more!<br/><br/>But if you are a nitpicking movie buff like me...I advise you to lower your expectations by a thousand, throw any kind of logic or science(for that matter)out the window and enjoy Revenge of the Fallen for what it is. a popcorn-summer-blockbuster!"

When you go to see an action film about talking walking robots, that is supposed to be aimed at a universal audience, you cannot expect it to be an Oscar contender for best movie. Yes, the first scene with Megan Fox might as well have had her straddling the bike naked with a spanner hanging suggestively from her lips, but the film follows on from where the original left off in many ways. yes, the plot is hokey, and yes, the film is overlong with a few too many hammy scenes with hammy robots, and I agree- why would a robot be talking the language of ""street""- but come on, Jazz in the original was from 'da hood', Bumble bee was a break dancing DJ- are the two films really so dissimilar? If you want a riot of action, with robots facing up toe-to-toe (with your better half constantly enquiring ""who's the good guy?""), then this film delivers in the WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO!

I know that the human form of the robot clashes with the original transformers but still....... I also liked the robots combining together. <br/><br/>The thing i didn't like about the movie is that they haven't focused more on the new arrivals like Arcee and sideswipe.

Besides the blurred fighting between two robots - which looked like two greys things pounding each other - the random close ups of Megan Fox, and too many sexual jokes: Michael Bay managed to make this movie into soft porn/action rubbish. Does he really think that by having so many repeated and unfunny jokes combined with reducing Megan Fox as a sex symbol that it will make the movie awesome? No it made it painful to watch; the acting was also atrocious and it was worsened thanks to the poorly written dialogue. Seriously it seems like a bunch of teenagers wrote the script: poor dialogue, the racial stereotype, the plot holes which is mind boggling at times. Can I even say there are plot holes? That would mean the movie had a plot - which none existent...<br/><br/>""Surprise, surprise Megatron is somehow revived from the dead! OMG, and then they want to destroy the sun for... energy?"" The reason why is vague, if it was explained then it was lost in the random fighting montages. Wow. What an intense story. Seriously it can't get any worse then that, where is the substance? Instead Bay gives us explosions and fights left and right, which at times were pointless. The plot struggled to maintain through the movie, the only thing it managed to do is leave huge holes and confusion.<br/><br/>The plot seemed like random facts/events mashed up together mixed in with references of the old grandpa robots. Not to worry we have mentions swine flu and Obama taking cover, which are supposed to bring realism? It seems like they're grasping at anything to pull this trash together. OK so it's a robot movie, I know I shouldn't have expected lot; some might say that the reason why they watch it is for the awesome robot fights. But even then those were a let down, and who doesn't want some substance when they watch a movie? <br/><br/>Now the robots;what the hell happened? The voice of Starscream - that was the most annoying thing in the movie. Since when did he become Igor? In the first movie they sounded more like robots, they had a sort of metal sound to their voice. They took that away and replaced it with stereotyped and/or annoying voices. It was hard to tell which robot was which, seeing as they were all grey and they were always fighting, so it looked like a bunch of blurs; however, not to worry since the robots have their own insignia so we know who the bad robots are. Jeez. Let's not talk about the racial stereotypes in the movie, it made me cringe. Was it supposed to be funny? And WHY would they show us a robot's balls?? WHY?? What is their obsession with balls and humping? <br/><br/>Finally the last scene is such a huge let down: Optimus Prime suddenly becomes Super robot and destroys Fallen in 2 minutes flat. Frig, where is the epic last battle scene? <br/><br/>Everything that made the first movie entertaining was taken away. I enjoyed the first one and I was excited to see this movie but I was sorely disappointed. I'm giving it 1.5 since some fighting sequence were pretty epic; well, when it was clear enough to see who was fighting who anyways. I should have waited till it came out on DVD."

"loopmyworld","8","5","7","9 January 2012"," Not the kind of revenge i expected but still its enjoyable in many parts !!!
","After the success of Transformes Michael Bay & Spielberg is back with Transformers revenge of the fallen. The movie introduces new alien robots like sideswipe, RC twins under autobots & newer version of bonecrusher & devastator under decepticons & the most important more hotter Megan Fox.<br/><br/>Movie starts brilliantly & grips you as autobots join the classified strike team nest & hunt for decepticons foes around the world, & on the other hand Sam goes to college begins his life along with Megan.The movie is all about matrix hidden somewhere in Egypt by the ancestors to protect from the decepticons around 1700 BC.Megatron returns to life with the only piece of cube left & the hunt for matrix starts between autobots & decepticons. The movie is has got some of the best action sequences & exceptional CGI graphics. My personal favourite forest battle, very well executed & amazing sound efforts during the whole battle. The robots looks more detailed & the action scenes are much more smoother than the previous one. Shia has improved a lot over this movie & of course so does the Megan with her killing sexier looks. Linkin park gives the best theme song in the transformers series {New Divide}. Steve as usual gives the best score for the movie, specially during the forest battle.<br/><br/>There are few things in the movie that i guarantee my viewers will agree with me. The RC twins were totally waste in the movie & the old age robot at the plane museum, actually they were irritating & were pain to my eyes & ears. On the other hand whenever the movie gets serious there are funny moments which ruins the mood of the movie this is the problem i have with you Bay get over it please. The movie could have been much better with the deletion of funny humour in the movie but still in many ways its enjoyable. I would recommend that Bay should have showen robots are replacing or repairing their parts damaged during the fight like painting their bodies, replacement of tyre's.<br/><br/>But still as i am huge transformers fan i enjoyed the movie, but definitely not as the first one for sure. I rate this movie 8/10 !!!!"

","The 2009 blockbuster, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the target of a lot of criticism. Many critics believe this movie, directed by Michael Bay, lacked the proper flow and substance of a proper story and overused special effects. They believe special effects don't tell a story, but it was the aesthetics of Transformers 2 that enhanced the narrative. Michael Bay, often known for his ""bay-os,"" introduced almost four times as many robots and used 555 effects shots in this film. Michael Bay's film utilizes the full potential of the medium and impresses audiences with new techniques. The film is technologically superior and casts a great example of a visually acclaimed film. Michael Bay stressed special effects and they were clearly illustrated in the film, which used 140 trillion bytes of ILM's (Industrial Light & Magic) memory—the most of any film ever. <br/><br/>Special effects played a vital role in the film's overall impact. The way in which Michael Bay told the story of Sam was through multiple new inventive techniques. He showcased slow motion, scale models, and emotions in the faces of his sixty robots. Slow motion of his robots kicking, and slamming the Decepticons in the face impacted viewers and put them right in the action. It is difficult to render slow motion with robots that have thousands of mechanical parts. In each frame, the forty animators had to fixate every small part to make the robot seem realistic. Slow motion was used when Optimus Prime defeated Bone Crusher (6:51), when three Decepticons killed Optimus Prime in the forest battle (1:02:00), and when Bumblebee saved Sam in the abandoned factory. Michael Bay was trying to avoid animations that most sci-fi films use to depict ordinary objects. What many consider an overuse of special effects was actually a necessary amount of visual aids to depict robots that seem real in every moment of the adventure. <br/><br/>Many Sci-Fi films like Transformers 2 need to use scale models to depict over-sized creatures. Michael Bay went over the top and used seven different scale models of cars to create the biggest Decepticon, the Destroyer. With the mapped out version of the cars and CGI, he was able to create the 52,000-part creature. This miniature effect was also used when the naval base collapsed. The crew created a smaller version of the product and later shattered it to pieces. <br/><br/>Lastly, the way Michael Bay impacted viewers was through his use of computer-generated imaging. In the sequel to the film, Shawn Kelly and his team's goal was to give the robots emotions and have more close- ups. Most films hide close-ups of generated creatures, but Michael Bay took on the challenge. Most of his scenes were shot in the light, so more detail was added to his transformers. They added blades around the eyes and mouth so emotions could be controlled. The techniques were impressive because now viewers felt a connection with the Autobots. We saw Bumblebee cry when Sam left for college (16:46), and the Transformers mad when they were asked to leave Planet Earth. Close ups and wide shots of the Fallen's face dreading over us gave viewers a disgusted feeling. Overall, the use of CGI helped enhance the whole film.<br/><br/>Explosions, pyrotechnic machines, transformations, graphic maps, and time-lapse photography are many of the effects that make Transformers 2 technologically superior. Michael Bay composed a thriller movie in just two years. It is statistically proved that it would take any viewer 16,000 years to do what they did on our home PCs. CGI helped put most of the sixty characters on screen. The team would take 360- degree pans around the environment they were shooting in, then go back to ILM to place the characters in it. Michael Bay used real backgrounds to make the transformers look realistic and their actual size. Had he used blue screen, viewers would not have been able to see their full bodies. The film is also technologically superior because it makes use of IMAX, the newest effect. Destroyer, the seven-car Decepticon, took 72 hours to render at ILM. <br/><br/>Animations, and CGI are a few of the many special effects that are employed. However, Michael Bay used some effects better than others. His films strongest technological points were its use of CGI and slow motion. Both of these impressive effects created the feeling of arousal and reality. For example, many individuals applauded after a slow to fast motion punch by Optimus Prime in the forest fight. Some techniques, however, could have been employed better. The weakest point of the film was its use of close ups on the CGI Decepticons. The crew fixated many of the Autobots by placing more detail into their faces but, slightly less on the Decepticons. In addition, there were many jump cuts to go to special effects that sometimes made it overwhelming. In one scene you see Sam falling, and in the next he's on his feet with an explosion behind. <br/><br/>Overall, the film was a technological achievement, utilized the full potential of the medium and therefore was a success. The film used many techniques and Michael Bay pushed his team until the best quality was fulfilled. For example, he made four individuals work for three months to create an 8-second frame of the girl Decepticon. Michael Bay made them do the transformation by hand so that viewers can get the sense of her skin peeling apart. In addition, the shattering of the pyramid by the Destroyer in the last sequence of the film took the team seven months to program the behavior of the bricks. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen wasn't a film that was put together easily. Many are surprised it was composed in two years of a budget of $200 million. Due to the technological achievement, eye grasping visuals, and spectacular transformations, I rate the film a 9/10."
"echodaxx12","7","5","7","10 October 2011"," Action Lovers Only, the worst in the trilogy
","I love the transformers trilogy. I love this film. But, unfortunately, it is the worst in the trilogy. <br/><br/>I'll admit, the film is under plotted, however, this is partly because, fans expected action. And that's what they got. Many critics forget to realize that this film was not meant to deliver an excellent plot. But, when i walked out of the theater I felt there was this strange dislike for the film that I later found to be caused by the removal of some good characters from the first film, which is another flaw in the film.<br/><br/>Now, lets move on to the good things. The number one good thing was the ridiculous amount of action and robot guts. Yeah for robot guts! And that's about it, and that makes the film sound bad, but trust me, it's not as bad as some make out.<br/><br/>Now, the last and worst criticism that some accept as fact is in my opinion absolutely stupid. Skids and Mudflap are not racist. The racism that these two are criticized for is caused by their monkey-like posture and body shape, the way they talk, and the fact that their illiterate. This does not necessarily mean that these robot's are racist. And even if they are, I don't doubt there are other films that many think of as great that are also racist.<br/><br/>So, this film is for die hard action or Transformers fans. If you plan on seeing this film, it's important to know what to expect. In this film, expect lots of robot action and robot guts and a plot that is only acceptable in films like this. overall, this film is a great visual effects thrill ride, with a plot that could definitely have been better."
"mwg0093","Null","5","7","7 September 2011"," Exactly What We Want Out of a Transformers Film
","The first Transformers amazed viewers with its fabulous special effects, so much so that it left us (including myself) begging for more epic fight scenes between giant robots from a different planet. Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen brings us just that...and only that. A lack of a central plot and some slightly poor script writing dampens Transformers. Despite this, director Michael Bay has indeed given what we have longed for. Amazing special effects. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a good film, not a great one like the previous movie, but a good one. After all, the only reason why we watch Transformers is for the action scenes. And there is plenty for everybody in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. 7/10"
"Al_The_Strange","8","5","7","4 July 2011"," ""I rise, you fall!""
","Customary to any sequel in a major franchise, the action must be bigger, badder, and more epic. The story has to broaden. The conflict has to be ramped up more than before. I don't think anybody would argue that ""RotF"" fails in this field; the action is easily more impressive than the first film. From the incredibly massive chase scene in Shanghai to the epic finale in Egypt, the film takes us on an epic journey all over the world, blowing more s**t up, and causing unprecedented amounts of mass carnage! Entire highways are reduced to rubble, an aircraft carrier is ripped in half, the ancient pyramids are desecrated; these are incredible scenes that may never be topped (well, except for the next ""Transformers"" film).<br/><br/>This film has been panned by audiences and critics for a number of reasons though. In their efforts to make things bigger, fill up the film with shedloads of new ideas, and take the story to multiple locales, the filmmakers may have indeed neglected to make the story congeal and flow as properly as it should. Some folks claim that the film has no story, but that's pure exaggeration; the story's quite clear-cut to me, just too much all over the place. If they toned the story down and maintained a steadier focus, the story would have probably would have won more hearts. Not to mention the myriad of lesser nitpicks; one too many crude jokes, perceived plot holes and inconsistencies, questionable mythology, the twins, etc.<br/><br/>Personally, the issues regarding the story, humor, plot, characters, and everything else has never bothered me. If it wasn't for the Internet, I might have never known this movie sucks! Suffice to say, none of this has ever hampered my enjoyment of the film, and it hasn't affected my opinion of the plot. In my opinion, the plot works in its own inherent way. Just as a sequel should, it showcases the villains having their glory, while continuing the main character's development. The film is admittedly overblown in a lot of ways, but I love it anyway.<br/><br/>Like before, the film has gorgeous picturesque photography and some very fast and hectic editing. Editing can be a little screwy, as certain shots are repeated or recycled from the first film. Altogether though, I think the action is better-framed and it's much easier to see the robots than from the first film. Acting is about as strong or as weak as before; Shia LaBeouf is still semi-lovable and semi-annoying. I think Megan Fox puts on a stronger performance here (or perhaps is more likable, or else has more material to work with; either way, her presence is stronger). John Turturro, Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, Peter Cullen, and Hugo Weaving all return and are decent. Production value is still insanely high, with no expense spared on sets, props, costumes, special effects, or all the genuine military hardware and personnel on display. Aside from one or two iffy rock songs, the music is quite smashing.<br/><br/>Given all the hate this films receives, I can only recommend it as a rental.<br/><br/>4/5 (entertainment: 5/5, story: 3.5/5, film: 4/5)"

","TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN Director: Michael Bay Country: USA Year: 2009 Language: English Runtime: 141 Minutes Rating: 12A<br/><br/>I remember my Dad bringing me to the cinema to see THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (1980), I remember the sweets and I remember the bottle of coke but most of all I remember the film. And even though EMPIRE hasn't stood the test of time all that terribly well, I still pop it into the DVD player every now and then for a quick viewing.<br/><br/>A decade later I still loved going to the movies. A bunch of us would descend on the cinema still lapping up the sweets and coke but also lapping up tickets for films like GOODFELLAS (1990) or TERMINATOR 2 (1991). I pop both of those into the DVD player too.<br/><br/>When TRANSFORMERS (2007) was made it was such a monumental hit that the sequel was green-lit almost immediately and it hit out screens this past weekend. It's an exhausting experience. It's overly long and overly complicated, it's a brash, loud, boring mess. <br/><br/>In TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, to give the film its full title, two years have passed since Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf), which is a ridiculous name, and the Autobots saved the human race from the invading Decepticons. Now Sam's preparing for the biggest challenge of his life – leaving home for college. Despite his extreme heroics, the battle of Mission City has become an urban legend believed only by conspiracy theorists. Sam is still an average teenager with everyday anxieties and excitement about heading off into adulthood, separating from his parents and vowing to be faithful to his girlfriend. You'd think as his girlfriend is the stunningly beautiful Megan Fox that this last shouldn't prove too difficult!<br/><br/>Any-hoo this leaving of home is something that the Autobots can relate to – the Autobots are the 'good' robots, by the way. Somewhere along the way the bad robots, the Decepticons, raise their heads. They were defeated in the first movie, but are back with a vengeance to crush all life on Earth. What follows is an ugly war between the good and the bad. No prizes for guessing who wins.<br/><br/>So did this movie move me? It did. But most definitely not in the way intended, as I sat in the cinema all I could think about were the movies of my youth and how sad it is that films like TRANSFORMERS get made. It has no heart and tries to make up for it with a preponderance of special effects and a thumping score. I really doubt that anyone who sees this movie, whether watching it with their Dad or with their friends will remember it with fondness. And that's pretty sad. And I bet that very few people will pop it into a DVD player in a decade or three and that's pretty sad too."

I personally don't have any problem with it. So long as a plot is there at all, I'm good. But that's just me.<br/><br/>Now, if you're one who likes a good, thorough, consistent plot throughout the movie, this most certainly is not a movie for you. However, if you like to watch movies just for the effects, this is definitely the movie for you.<br/><br/>Other reasons why I like this movie: I like to watch movies just for the effects.

Yes the movie is long, and some of the transformers are rude, but the action is great and we are given more character development for the transformers this time around, and the story was more about the transformers and not just about Sam. But there's still room for Sam's character and all the other humans as well.<br/><br/>What more can I say?

I'm not as picky as many posters who hate it so much they give it a 1 or 2 star or something. But it definitely felt like it dragged on more than it was supposed to.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe was the limiting of the lines of the veteran autobots. Ironhide said a couple of lines and I believe Rachet said one line. We also didn't see much of the new Autobots especially Sideswipe which I like. I like his look and wish he had more to do with the plot.<br/><br/>But overall I don't think the story is as bad as people say it is.

I don't think I wasted my money.<br/><br/>The one really good thing that this movie had that was better than the first one is...Optimus kicks ass at the end....and in the middle.

"gigan-92","5","9","15","18 July 2009"," Of Course Action Packed But Lacking In More Than a Few Areas
","After not too long of a wait, Transformers 2 has finally arrived. If you were expecting the flawed yet lovable first film then too bad, so sad. If you were expecting a live-action version of the show with pure giants robots fighting each other then you're in luck. This film simply isn't on par with its predecessor. The action and SFX are obviously beyond superb, but what film's aren't these days? Micheal Bay seriously needs to stop thinking non stop action and crude humor will make a sensational movie. He simply failed here. The story feels like kind of a jumbled mess if you ask me, but it gets the job done I guess. Bay just tries to really over do the film really. Somehow big explosions and cool sound effects are going to make this film out do the first but I'm not buying it. Megan Fox on top of a motor cycle in tiny booty shorts, ""special brownies"", dogs and decepticons humping multiple objects and plenty of foul language are just a few of examples of how our director tries to keep our interest during this nearly 3-hour film. Shia LaBeouf can definitely act, as he's proved before in multiple films, but he really down rates him self here.<br/><br/>The dialouge between Sam and his girl friend is so painfully corny at times one can barely stand to watch. Still, the humor undeniably saves the film and adds what it does to it. It does however subtract from the screen time for our new autobots who indeed looked incredibly bad ass. All they do is shoot and get shot, unlike in the first film where we actually had time to get to know each autobot. Except for the ""twin"" robots who were actually getting annoying by the end of the film. The decepticons aren't characterized very well honestly and all too often are portrayed as mindless monsters. Luckily Star Scream returns but the battles are so chaotic, one can hardly tell the bad guys apart."

","I would like to start off by saying that this was an extremely entertaining movie. The action was intense and it literally kept me on the edge of my seat with my jaw grating the floor! The CGI effects are incredible and really blend in well with the live action elements, very seamless.<br/><br/>The story line is OK, far from spectacular. A lot of people are complaining about how believable it is, but the movie is about a race of alien robots who disguise themselves as vehicles! Come on!!! It has some very funny moments, the twins Skids + Mudflaps for example, along with the Witwicky parents add that comical element to the movie. Shia & Megan do a good job with some solid performance's and they really pull off a convincing relationship in the movie.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that it is very long and I think they could have at cut out at least 30 minutes from this movie. A few of the scenes do not add anything to the film and left me thinking 'wtf was that about? Also, it is easy to lose track of all the autobots/decepticons, especially nearer the end when a load of them appear from nowhere! All in all, a spectacular action movie with incredible CGI.

The two gang banger robots are not funny just because they talk about farts and genitals. Sam's parents are annoying as hell and the dogs hump hardy har har. #3 Megan Fox. Yeah she's hot but she can't act to save her life. #4 The action sequences are bleary and nauseating. #5 Michael Bay does not know the difference between story and specal effects. He is what makes this atrocity so atrocious. He shouldn't just never be allowed to make another movie again, he should be arrested for releasing this monstrosity upon the world. SHAME ON YOU Mr. Bay. #6 It's way too long. It's not like the Lord of the Rings which was a masterpiece and had a reason for being so long. This just goes on and on and leads to nothing.

"teeleigh417","4","29","61","28 June 2009"," One big ""WTF?""
","This summer seems to mark the death of entertainment itself. First Farrah Fawcett, then Michael Jackson, and now Transformers 2. Billy Mays' death could also count, as he is also an American institution.<br/><br/>My four stars go to the incredible CGI. Pretty much impeccable, in my opinion. Though 21st century SFX are growing more and more amazing, there is in fact a limit. The camera can't seem to focus on anything for more than 10 seconds (unless it's Megan Fox's slo-mo bouncing breasts), and the battles were so fast that I nearly went into REM just to keep up. I know this is an action movie, and plot usually takes second, but TONE IT DOWN, GAH! I personally love a good ass-kicking at least once every 30 minutes, but the human brain can only take so much. Especially the last scene, which could have been reduced by 50% and still have the same effect. It seems that when Michael Bay couldn't think of anything creative to show, he just said, ""blow it up."" That'll get em.<br/><br/>Speaking of toning things down, did we REALLY have to get a shot of huge alien robot testicles? I mean, did it REALLY serve ANY purpose at all? This just further proves my belief that Hollywood thinks the rest of America (and the world) is just a big bunch of baffoons who can't handle intellectual humor. After about the tenth time, I just groaned when a character farted or humped something. I was also slightly offended that all the women were either insanely gaga, overly sexually aggressive, or just eye candy. I know Transformers is mostly appealing to males, but please, guys are going to drag their girlfriends in, too.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment was that hardly any of the new Autobots and Decepticons were introduced properly, all 25834758794754 of them. Did they ever even mention the name of the motorcycle chick Autobot? And the only new ones who were developed were those two gangsta robots who resembled monkeys(though I have to admit, I did laugh at them). Not to mention the older characters received remarkably less face-time, save for Bumblebee (who can't talk again???). Optimus Prime, the most BA guy in this entire movie, only had like 60 minutes out of the 2.5 hours. And his most epic moments lasted about two minutes.<br/><br/>On one last note, I don't really understand what everyone's talking about when they complain about plot-holes, because I never really noticed any. Then again I was just kind of in a daze trying to not overload on excessive visual and aural stimuli.<br/><br/>Overall, when you have to ask yourself ""WTF?"" at least sixteen times throughout the film, perhaps its time for the directors to take some Ritalin."

","We've had a string of pretty bad movies as of late... Twilight, of course, with the resounding theme of ""People in General are Stupid Morons"", and Wolverine, which was less like a movie with plot holes and more like a giant plot hole with bits of movie floating around in it, just to name two. But Transformers 2... Good Lord.<br/><br/>A note to Hollywood film makers: provocative shots of Megan Fox accompanied by a script that is 80% stupid sex jokes does not a decent movie make, and it does not make up for a painful lack of original writing and realistic dialog. Seriously, Transformers 2 was nothing more than a cliché-salad with lots of explosions and debris flying about in the mix. Every remotely intelligible spoken line was either a tired cliché (seriously, did the villains really just say, ""This isn't over!"", seriously? And did the cantankerous veteran robot really just say, ""I'm getting too old for this crap?"") or a cheap, dirty sex joke (Oh, look, a running gag where a little chihuahua is *ahem* ""dominating"" the other one. And if that's not enough, lets have a gag where a small robot humps Megan Fox's leg, that ought to be good for a laugh. How about a gag where Megan Fox falls from the sky and lands face-down on a male character's crotch? Pure gold.). Every other line was spoken so quickly or with so many sound effects going on in the background that you couldn't hear it, and my guess is it was probably another round of clichéd sex jokes, anyway, so I guess I wasn't missing much.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure what today's adolescent generation expects of their coming college years, but if they expect that Michael Bay's representation that every single college girl will be falling over herself to jump into bed with them and college professors will conduct riveting Astronomy lectures using phrases like ""heated, passionate, thrusting Orion and fair, seductive, nubile Virgo"", they are going to be sorely disappointed. This just wasn't funny! It was a poor parody at best, and in a movie that was not intended as parody, it was just poor, cheap, writing that the director hoped would score some points with the masses.<br/><br/>Besides the painfully pedestrian and entirely unfunny ""comedy"", the first hour of the movie was a lot of stupid and mostly meaningless dialog fired between characters so rapidly you'd think the writers never heard the phrase ""Take a beat"" or ""Pause"". The last hour of the movie was a senselessly chaotic mishmash of explosions and robot parts flying around, and I think there MIGHT have been a plot point mixed in there somewhere, but honestly I was too overwhelmed by the amount of unidentifiable debris fighting for attention on the screen. When I go to a Michael Bay film I at least expect some worthwhile special effects and actions sequences, but for this film I might as well have just gone out, bought some Transformers toys, stuck them in the blender and watched them puree for an hour. At least then I might have had some idea which robot parts belonged to who and, incidentally, which side was winning.<br/><br/>Overall, this was one of the most disappointing recreations of our favorite childhood cartoons I have seen come out of Hollywood yet. For the love of all that is pure and good, I pray that movie-goers will start demanding better from the movie directors and producers and stop accepting such cheap, worthless imitation."

","After seeing this at the cinema I gave Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen another watch yesterday, I know a lot of people who have seen it would wonder why I was wasting my time but I have to admit its a guilty pleasure of mine.<br/><br/>We pick up with the story two years after the events of the first. The Autobots have united with the US Military hunting down Decepticons, when they learn of an ancient Decepticon that is coming to destroy the human race.<br/><br/>Its not that I think the story should be completely void of a human story line, but I just don't care whether or not Sam, the main character, can keep his girlfriend while he goes to college especially when there's fighting robots in the same movie. The film comes in at a hefty 150 minutes run time, which I think even tests a die hard fans concentration levels, it definitely needs some trimming down in certain places.<br/><br/>There was far too many rubbish jokes in there as well, although a couple of them made me laugh, the mother getting off her face with hash cakes and running loose on a college campus and John Turturro making a robot-scrotum reference were highlights for me, also the promise of Matthew Marsden coming on screen with his cringe-worthy acting is always entertaining but for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>You have to take it at face value though, its entertaining however you look at it.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews please go to http://alansmitheejrmovieblog.blogspot.com/"
"emasterslake","Null","8","13","2 July 2009"," A nutshell review on this summer's talked about sequel.
","Transformers 2 has had a lot to offer. Including the usage of more Autobots and Decepticons than the first one had to offer. As well as a continuing story from what was left off in the previous installment.<br/><br/>In the sequel, the Autobots have form alliance with the U.S. military in tracking down the remaining Decepticons that are wandering around parts of the world. While Sam is trying to keep his involvement with Optimus to a minimum by attending college, however after encountering a piece of the all spark from the first movie. A great deal of information had raced through his own head, and Sam ends up writing symbols of a code to something that the Decepticons are interested in getting hold of. Sam who tries his hardest to live a normal college life finds himself involve with the Autobots saving the planet yet again.<br/><br/>This sequel was slightly better than the first one, but it didn't get where it was suppose to in surpassing the original. One would think that Michael Bay and the rest of the film team would be able to know what the old and new fans of the franchise want to see in a Transformers movie. The only pet peeve about this movie was the scenes that weren't necessary for the story itself, most the ones that involved the humans. While there's so much they could of added for this movie. Maybe giving some more screen time for most of the Transformers or more scenes involving Decepticon hunting.<br/><br/>The only reason why I gave this movie an 8/10 was cause of the usage of more transformers than the other one and the transformer battles which saved the movie from being bad. I would give it a 9/10 if they took out the unneeded parts of the movie and more screen time on the Transformer's side of the movie.<br/><br/>There's always a chance for the third installment to be better than this one. But let's hope they'll learn their pet peeves and know what to include for the next sequel. My suggestion is include a battle royal of at least a hundred Autobots and Decepticons fight against one another, that's what I'd like to see for a third installment, cause what would be more entertaining than watching all of your favorite transformers having their own role in the field of battle."
"clashcityrocker05","6","38","83","19 June 2009"," More of the same....in a bad way **SPOILERS**
","Well, this is a hard one to comment on. It was good, but not what it could have been. Let's start with the negatives: - Devastator/Constructicons have NO introduction. They just kind of appeared. - Too many unidentified robots. - WAY TOO LONG! The first was even a tad too long for a Transformers movie, so this one is just ridiculous. - Skidz and Mudflap are the two most annoying characters I have seen in a film in a long time. - Much of the CGI was actually worse this time around. The textures were spot-on and it mostly looked life-like, but the transformers seemed to move at a lower frame rate than the rest of the movie, making them looked stuttery. - The whole film ended with a bit of an anti-climax. - Megatron OR Optimus Prime should not have been resurrected. - Please zoom out, Michael Bay! At times, it is hard to see what is going on!<br/><br/>But it is not ALL bad. The good points are: - The fight scenes are brilliant. It raises the bar yet again for CGI, but it needs to be tightened a bit. - Retains the humour from the first one. - The sound. The sound in this film is incredible. Much better than the first film, especially during the pyramid battle as well as the Paramount/Dreamworks bit at the start. - Scorponok has a really incredible entrance. You almost forget about him until he appears.<br/><br/>So there are more bad points than good, but that is just me. The first film, for me, was a 9 out of 10. The only bad point was the 2hr10minute MINIMUM running time. This is 147 minutes, so it gets a little silly in terms of running time. Still, I hope you enjoy it."
"RyanEberhart","9","6","9","19 September 2013"," Pretty Good
","I liked this Transformers movie better than the first movie. Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen has a better plot line than Transformers, regardless of what other people say. There are actually two plot lines in this one; one where Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) and Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) delve deeper into their relationship and the other the continued civil war between the Autobots and the Decepticons. Yeah I know, not the best combination of plot lines, especially for a Sci-Fi movie.<br/><br/>In Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen we learn more about what started the war between the Autobots and the Decepticons. A long time ago Optimus Primes ancestors visited Earth in order to harvest energon, which comes from the sun, any sun. However, when it was discovered that there was life on Earth, the Primes decided to leave Earth alone and find a new source for energon. Unfortunately, one of the Primes refused to accept this decision and tried to harvest the sun anyway. The other Primes defeated the one, forever after known as the Fallen, and to prevent him from ever turning on the machine again they decided to hide the matrix. The matrix is pure energon and it is what powers the machine that would harvest the sun. To hide the matrix the remaining Primes sacrificed themselves and entombed it in a mountain cave.<br/><br/>Yeah, I know. It's called Science Fiction for a reason.<br/><br/>Now the parts of this movie I like have a lot to do with Sam Witwicky. During the first half hour of the movie he finds a shard from the cube that was destroyed in the first movie stuck to the shirt he was wearing at the time. He kept it as a souvenir. He gives the shard to Mikaela for safe keeping before going off to college. When he gets to college he finds out that his roommate is an alien robot paparazzi wannabe, but decides to go with the flow... especially since he can't get another room assignment. Sam and his flatmates go to a party where Sam meets Alice (Isabel Lucas). Isabel is extremely interested in Sam, apparently. Bumblebee, in Camaro form, comes to warn Sam that the Decepticons have located the remains of Megatron and another piece of the Cube. Sam refuses to get involved. The next day in an Astronomy class Sam reads his text book in less than a minute and attempts to correct his professor... he is asked to leave. Sam figures out that when he touched the shard from his shirt the information was somehow transferred to him. Also maybe some superhuman abilities.<br/><br/>Again, I know. It's Sci-Fi.<br/><br/>Another part of this that I like the take charge side of Sam that emerges as he tries to figure out where the matrix is. He enlists the help of his girlfriend, Mikaela, even though she is upset that she caught him making out with Alice. Fortunately for Sam, Alice turned out to be a robot that could change into human form. I think Mikaela forgave Sam for that indiscretion. Sam also enlists the help of his roommate, Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez), and former Agent, Simmons (John Turturro). Together, with the help of Bumblebee and a couple of other Autobots and a turn-coat Decepticon they figure out how to read the symbols that Sam keeps seeing. They end up going to The Smithsonian Air & Space Museum near Washington, D.C. to take to Jetfire (Mark Ryan). Jetfire turns out to be a reformed Decepticon and helps Sam and the others by transporting them all to Egypt.<br/><br/>The next scene I like is when Sam is trying to get to Optimus Prime to revive him. First he has to get his parents to safety and tells them to take Mikaela, but his dad, Ron Witwicky (Kevin Dunn), tries to stop Sam from going. Sam's mom, Judy Witwicky (Julie White), tells Ron that he has to let him go. Mikaela refuses to leave Sam, so they run to Optimus. Along the way they are picked up by Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and his team. While they make a run for it Sam runs in the direction of Optimus as everyone else goes a different direction. As he is running a Decepticon is shooting at him, one of the shots hits the ground near him and blows him off course, and apparently when he hits the ground he is dead. As he is lying there with a medic trying to revive him, with Mikaela crying over him, Sam has an out-of-body experience where he takes with the Primeval Primes (Say that 10 times fast!). The Primes tell him that he has the ability to revive Optimus, he always had it. At that point he wakes up. It's not all of this that I like, technically it is, but what I really liked was way back at the beginning of the movie Mikaela was trying to get Sam to say ""I Love You"", but he wouldn't; as he is laying there, apparently dead, she says it to him, then he wakes up his first words are ""You said it first."" Sucker! <br/><br/>A lot that I am not describing is pretty damn funny, so I would suggest watching it. You know some critics don't like Michael Bay because he puts beautiful women, sometimes too many, in his movies. I just say that that is our society. I bet you the same critics, mostly women, who complained about the beautiful women in these three movies had no complaints about Twilight with Robert Pattinson or when Taylor Lautner was walking around with his shirt off. Hypocrites!<br/><br/>Anyway, I give this a 9 out of 10 stars. I don't know what could have made it better."
"desert-jackets","8","6","9","4 September 2013"," Not a Great Action movie what I anticipated!!
","This film is perhaps the most extreme expected release of 2009 and you can see the stress Michael Bay has put into this film to elongate it. The actual object that brought this movie downward was the continuous stooping to this immature level. They kept stopping but the romance was never built and so the story couldn't keep tempo.<br/><br/>First of all, I wanna to discuss on the visual effects and action scenes which are superb but unluckily you hardly see any action in the first half, and then it's is divided by pointless and boring romantic scenes. I liked the first Transformers and I was very anxious to see this 'Transformers 2' but after may be an hour, I was anxious to walk off. I went to watch the Robots battling and that's what I saw for about 90% in this movie. Therefore, if ""Transformers 1"" didn't please you, then this part 2 is not worthy-watching for you.<br/><br/>The major problem with the movie is that it doesn't carry anything new to the blend. The cast is about totally the same.It is mainly a war among the robots with humans trapped in the middle in different places. There is some great acting, particularly by Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Megan Fox and Josh Dunhamel.<br/><br/>But overall, this movie is visually vibrant and possesses the most terrific special effects than the previous Transformers. It was legitimately interesting. This movie is not a complete spoiler, but I do let drop some stuff. Overall it's a good movie and gets a deserving 8/10 by me.<br/><br/>For all Hollywood Leather jackets, visit desertleather.com"

","Revenge of the Fallen continues the movie franchise as the battle between the autobots and decepticons continues. This time, the leader of the fallen plans to take over our world as the autobots once again need the help of Sam Witwicky once again to help them win the battle, but after Optimus Prime gets killed by Megatron, now resurrected and is tracking Sam down to find the Matrix of Leadership which it has the power to resurrect a prime and our heroes must somehow save the world once again.<br/><br/>My friend from school showed me the trailer and I waited until June of 2009 to see it and I've finally did.<br/><br/>Michael Bay's directing was good, The storyline was almost slow, but some of the scenes were well-paced like the storyline from the first movie. The cinematography and the actors were almost as good, but they were still entertaining, again, the Witwicky family weren't given enough screen time, but were still great. The action scenes were amazing and the humor was as good as the ones in the first.<br/><br/>The two problems that I do have with this movie is that the dialog is pretty banal and there are two scenes that felt pretty awkward to me. With those flaws aside, I understand that some people, included fans of the first film, hated this movie, but for me, I think that this is a pretty great film although not in the same depth as the first. It may have won some golden raspberry awards, but for me, I'm totally recommending this to Michael Bay fans.<br/><br/>4.0/5 stars"
"graysonnenneau","7","6","9","17 June 2011"," Great effects,loads of fun, but just doesn't work
","This movie would be amazing as a television series, but i thought that for a movie it was just a little too loud. The movie opens with an explanation about how the earth was visited by transformers long before advanced human civilization develops. Pretty good idea...except why wouldn't the transformers have stayed and interrupted human history all the way, and not have just randomly disappeared after the stone age? This is the first of many plot holes as the story progresses. After main titles, there is an amazing action sequence which involves a special ops team called ""N.E.S.T"" which consists of human and autobot soldiers that work together to find and weed out remaining decepticons. They find a massive decepticon that bursts through a bridge. When optimus mortally wounds him, he tells them the fallen will ride again. The second that line came out, i kept a close eye on my watch waiting for this to end. It was followed by the introduction to Sam Witwicky's family preparing for Sam to go to college. This scene erupts into a battle between bumblebee and the kitchen sink (household objects are turned into mini decepticons.)Megan fox shows her face, which leads to bad acting, even worse attempts at comic relief that were over the top and just unnecessary, i mean mini robots humping the crap out of Megan fox's leg? yeah, no... Even more annoying was having to see mudflap and skids, two annoying autobots that were a racial slurr themselves. Still, this movie had it's up's and downs. There were amazing battle sequences with just about a billion slow mo sequences (half of which were focused on Megan fox, which was at times a let down) but we were never properly introduced to the main villain of the film called the fallen. he sort of just came into the movie, and was killed almost as quickly and abruptly as he was introduced. <br/><br/>If you haven't already seen this film i recommend that all ages under 40 that can at least tolerate bad humor and acting should view it. it is a good experience with visually stunning images and villains you can at least remember the name of. i still give it a 7/10, however bad it may seem."

I loved the story, I can feel what Sam is feeling throughout the film, the action is packed with more packing, and I understand that Michael Bay had the Twins act the way they do just to ad some culture. Also, why would you hate a film where Optimus Prime, leader of the heroic Autobots kicks more amounts of Decepticon @$$ than the first film? I wasn't disappointed in the first film, I wasn't disappointed in this film, and I'm very certain I won't be disappointed in the upcoming 3rd film, ""Dark of the Moon.""

I wasn't expecting wonderful acting or a great story. I was expecting a entertaining fun time and of course Megan Fox.<br/><br/>The Things I liked: 1. The chemistry between all the old actors from the first movie was great. You could tell they were having a good time filming the movie. You could tell by how good a acting job everyone did. I was surprised.<br/><br/>2. The action/special effects: The were both great. I'm glad they got the help of the military again for this movie it added to both the feel and action of the film. All the actors/stunt men did a great job.<br/><br/>Then there was ILM and their special effects of the action and Transformers was superb.<br/><br/>3. Megan Fox: Damn she is hot. What ever flaws this film had she did a great job of distracting me during the movie. I think I might have given this film 4 stars of less if it weren't for her.<br/><br/>The things I didn't like.<br/><br/>1. The Story: This was the worst part of the film. It just made almost no sense. Especially the part about there being a source of energon on Earth, but there was none, so what was the point of building the weapon on Earth when I'm sure they could have done it on any of the other planets.<br/><br/>2. The Transformers: The special effects were great, but there were just way to many characters. The only ones that had any impact for me was Optimas Prime, Bumble Bee, Soundwave(one of my favorite characters for the old show.), Star Scream, Megatron, and Jet Fire(Who I thought was a great character.), the rest were cannon fodder.<br/><br/>Overall: A really good movie worth seeing, but again this is a Michal Bay movie. They same guy who directed Bad Boys 1 and 2, Pearl Harbor, and Armageddon so don't expect a amazing story and great acting worthy of Oscars. Expect a fun time with a bad story, decent to good acting, and great action and special effects."
"EijnarAmadeus","1","28","59","26 June 2009"," The plot-holes Bay makes leaves much bigger craters than his explosions.
","Michael Bay was so fittingly named the 'true Decepticon' by Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers, he truly ruins everything that anybody anywhere could ever truly like about this whole franchise; he makes Shia LeBeouf into this adventurer that didn't remind me anything of the character of the first movie, Megan Fox is sun bathed into becoming a underused but still terrible character, the robots are becoming less and less mechanical and more and more organic, the action scenes are a whole lot of mess, the sidekicks (whether it's the new twin-robots, John Turturro or nerdy schoolmate Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez)) are all instruction manuals to creating horrible characters with perfectly timed unfunny lines - I could go on forever about this.<br/><br/>I found out more interesting things about my teeth during this watch than whatever Bay could throw at me on screen. It's exhausting duration-time does not help out when there's really no climax to appear, scene after scene after scene Bay tries topping himself with explosions, shiny cars, ""funny"" one-liners, robot-fights where it's impossible to tell who's fighting who, an outrageously bad love story and a dooming story that uses bogus words to get out of a clamp. And for that matter, director Bay doesn't seem all that interesting in story, he is far more interesting in going out on the highway (again!) and making those wheels screech, or loading-up military weapons with our men Josh Duhamel and Tyrese; the plot-holes he makes leaves much bigger craters than his explosions.<br/><br/>Using this kind of budget, and having so many ideas to pull from, we're left with what may just be the worst sequel of all time. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen does not manage to make one good scene; that's what I call a horrible mess."
"your_niceguy","1","34","74","26 June 2009"," Crapformers - Revenge of the Bay
","When Transformers 1 got out in the movies, I was as hyped as any other guy who had played with the big and small robots in the 80s. I had Hot Rod with attachment and almost had the complete Devastator tank before I outgrew the toys. In short, I loved these guys, and the movie was a nice revisit to nostalgia.<br/><br/>The first movie had a decent story line, the transformations were moderate and the acting was at times semi corny (I don't blame the actors for that... *looks at Michael Bay*). But it was still entertaining, because you hadn't seen it before, it was a big thing seeing your old hero kick ass as you previously only could imagine it would look like in ""real life"".<br/><br/>Now, in what way does Transformers 2 differ? Not in a single way, except a weaker story line. There are no improvements, no proper introductions of the new robots, which simply just appear and starts whipping out dialogs, or more often monologues, that are supposed to be funny, but falls to the ground after the first two.<br/><br/>Do you remember back when Optimus would transform into the truck in the cartoons and you'd go ""where the f*** did his trailer come from??"", in this case you'll still be sitting ""what the f*** is going on?"" because Michael bay still does ultra close-ups, uses objects or terrain to cover the transformation, or there is so much going on that you won't see it. In other words, he still skips nice and easy over this part which is probably the coolest thing about both movies. To be honest, that was the biggest thing I was looking forward to in no. 1.<br/><br/>There is an upside for you fan-boys though: you'll see an excruciating amount of explosions big and small... just like Bay seems to like it. I guess he has an idea that that compensates bad directing.<br/><br/>For my part it was 2½ hours of pain... my girlfriend, who also like the first movie, walked out after 1½ hours. I only stayed to naively get value for money. As soon as the texts started rolling I was out of there, I didn't bother staying for any post-images that would only toss more shameful humor at me.<br/><br/>...Oh... if you're thinking that a digital presentation and THX sound is going to make this an experience, just like I did... you're wrong. Go to see this movie in the theater just to say you saw it, not because you want to watch a good movie.<br/><br/>When the next transformers comes out, I will read every critique about it, read every spoiler, then buy the DVD and then give it to a charity shop."
"ehrogers","2","27","57","29 June 2009"," Awful, just plain awful.
","I have been a long time IMDb user but this is my first review. I felt so betrayed by this movie that I felt I had to. This was easily the most disappointing films of the year so far. And it had so much potential. I was a transformers junkie when I was a kid, I liked the first movie, and I was excited by the trailer for this one. The premise was a good one and could have blossomed into an engaging story that moved this re-vitalization of the Transformers' Universe forward into possibly a third and fourth movie. Instead, it seemed to focus on potty-humor, dog-humping, and racial stereo-type humor, that was barely passable as funny the first few times they tried it, but since they went back to that same well over and over again it just became stupid. You didn't care about any of the new Transformer characters and you ended up not caring about the old characters either. The editing was horrible with scenes feeling like they were jumbled together haphazardly and even the Transformer battles went by so fast that it was hard to distinguish who was who and it all looked like a tornado hit a junk yard instead of a robot fight. And the testicles on the Constructicons, come on. Everyone in the audience groaned with most of us putting our faces in our hands ashamed of what has become of the Transformers in this, the most recent raping of the franchises of our youth. It is a sad state when we have to hang our hopes on GI Joe for some sort of salvation."

IT WAS A MASTERPIECE!!!!!!!I went to see Robots doing battle, and for 90% of the movie that's what I got. This isn't a film for those looking for a smart plot or realistic story lines and physical motion - this is something to visually gawk at, and sonically admire. This is special effects without having to think about it. There are plenty of other films that showcase superb character development and plot, but this isn't it and nor does it try to be."

This movie had no heart. How can you be really moved when everyone who Shia's character cares about stays alive in battle that defines the future of the universe? I mean, they were in the middle of the action the whole 150 minutes. And then Optimus Prime: He ""died"" in a way that doesn't feel like the ultimate good guy would die.

","i totally disagree with you, i thought it was a great movie that's what sucks about ever tom dick and harry these days you all think your critics. I got news, your no critic, stick with your day job, it was a great movie, special effects were amazing, story as just fine, could've been better but not as bad as your making out, it was good to see bumblebee get some more action this time, as for Sam being less naive well its been two years since the first movie, he's grown into a young adult, while off screen he's obviously learnt more, i mean he's not expected to know the whole origin of the transformers and how they came to be is he? as for the jokes, they aren't as bad your making them out too be. While it not being 100% to the original cartoon it was fun, had good action and effects. While the story could've been better, still not as bad as your making out. all up it's a good movie i think any transformers fan will appreciate it."

","From director Michael Bay comes the second installment of the Transformer series - ""Transformers - Revenge of the Fallen"". In this epic sequel, the war between the auto bots and the decepticons continues. The movie begins with a fight sequence involving the NEST, which is a joint umbrella group of humans and auto bots, fighting to eradicate the decepticons from planet Earth. Meanwhile, the protagonist of the series, Sam Whitwicky (Shia Laboeuf) prepares to join college as he leaves his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind. He encounters a piece of the Cube, the energizer of the transformers, which encodes the location of the Matrix in his mind. This Matrix can be used to activate machines called the Sun Harvesters, which are used by the transformers to transform the energy of the stars for their purposes.<br/><br/>This movie introduces the Fallen, an ancient transformer and founder of the decepticons. The Fallen was a part of a group of elite transformers called the Primes. The Primes had a rule that did not allow any of them to install a Sun Harvester on planet which still had life. The Fallen had flouted this rule and installed one on Earth. Thus, there had been war between Primes and the Fallen and the decepticons were born. This film follows the story of how the Fallen attempts to steal the Matrix from Sam and avenge his defeat at the hands of the Primes, by killing off Earth's Sun.<br/><br/>In line with its predecessor, this movie has stunning visual effects and resounding explosions. With a fast moving script, it keeps the viewer engaged for its full span of 150 minutes. The fight sequences are almost perfectly placed in the movie to enthrall the ones crazy for an adrenaline rush and the true transformers fan. All in all, it's a complete package for all the viewers."

"user-543-975655","7","2","2","11 June 2014"," Epic
","Because Transformers 4: Age of Extinction is coming out in less than a month, I decided to re-watch some of the older Transformers movies. After re-watching the first movie, I decided to review it (feel free to check that review out). Then, I thought it would be good to review all of the Transformers movies, which is why I am reviewing this. The Transformers series really is awesome, and it is one of my Top 5 favorite series. Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox really are a good couple in the movie, and they fit together perfectly, so they were great casting choices. Every other main casting choice was great, such as Josh Duhamel as Lennox, and Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. Everyone in the movie was great, however, and all played a believable part, and displayed their emotions and delivered their lines without a single problem or malfunction. One problem I had with the first movie was that the camera was extremely shaky during some of the battles. Sure, the recurring slow motion shots helped, but not all the time. There was not a shaky camera in this installment, and that really made me happy. The camera did a lot of cool angles, such as when they rotate around the action, or battles. Which were amazing except for one thing. Sure, the special effects were fantastic, and the battles were extremely entertaining. However, they were only entertaining when there were just 4-5 Transformers and a bunch of people at max. But there were some scenes where there were so many people and Transformers that I could not tell who was who. After you spend half of the battle figuring that out, they are really fun to watch. The special effects in the Transformers movies really are awesome, though. The Autobots and Decepticons look so great that they are even more believable than they would be if they were cheesy. The voice actors are so great in this movie, and all of the voice actors were perfect choices for the Transformers, which made them very fun to watch. The robots such as Mudflap and his twin added a lot of good humor to the film, as well. On to the music. The music was very good, and some of it was taken from the original Transformers, such as a song called Arrival to Earth, by Steve Jablonsky. Jablonsky made such good music for this movie, which is awesome because music is one of the most important parts of a movie. The setting varies greatly from the first movie, which is refreshing so it isn't like we are seeing the same battles again. The only reason I gave this movie only a 7 is because it is so long. Some of the scenes drag out way too much, and there were about five boring parts. The story also differs, which is good. The writers still used some of the objects in the first movie such as Energon and the AllSpark cube. There were new objects and new Transformers in this movie, which made it a lot better, too. That's all I have to say about Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Thanks for reading. See ya!"

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a good movie with a pretty good storyline and an average cast.Its definitely not as enjoyable as the first Transformers and it goes on too long,also an awful lot of the movie is very long action sequences,that go on for so long that after a while you don't even know whats going on.Shia Labeouf is just as good as the first,but Megan Fox is probably worse,I didn't like her in the first and I didn't like her in this,she is very attractive that is clearly the only reason she makes it in such big movies,because she can not act.Like the first my favourite actors are definitely the voice actors,they do a very impressive job voicing these strong characters,and the addition of the small auto it's was very humorous and added as a good comic relief.Fans of the first Transformers will be disappointed,but Revenge of the Fallen is still a good sequel. <br/><br/>After leaving Bumblebee and the other Autobots for college,Sam (Shia Labeouf) starts experiencing weird symbols in his head that result in the return of the Decepticons."
"stantonchris4","6","2","2","29 May 2013"," Not perfect but I had fun watching it
","This is a movie you really just have to turn off your brain and enjoy the action as opposed to interpreting it as an actual film. That is exactly what I did. There were many things that I did like about this movie including The special effects, which are top notch for any crannies film, and the action scenes were well put together and they were fun to watch. The comedy, even though unnecessary at times, still gave me a good laugh every now and then.Now for anybody who hates this film, there were still a lot of things to dislike about this film. For one thing, the script was very clichéd and not very creative, the dialogue was almost predictable. and also, for anybody that thinks Megan Fox is the only good part about this movie, think again, I really think she served no purpose in the film. I mean, seriously she does nothing! Anyway, I also think Megatron is a pretty lame villain. He just never came across as threatening but rather laughable,Like when he says to Sam, ""It feels good to grab your flesh!""Come on that's pretty silly. So does this film deserve the hate that It gets? Well, for the most part, But I still enjoyed watching it despite its flaws."

","I am at a loss to put into words the amount that Transformers, quite frankly, 'sucked.' The fact that a multi-million dollar budget and who- knows-how-many tonnes of explosives produced such a phenomenally uninteresting and poorly-crafted action film is beyond me. Micheal Bay, who I unashamedly call the village idiot of Hollywood, isn't able to maintain an engaging storyline (or what I would more accurately describe as a sensical arrangement of explosions) or for that matter an engaging anything. What ensues is a clumsy combination of hit and miss comedy, tediously long 'action' scenes, terribly written 'emotive' scenes and indecent use of the slow motion effect. Micheal Bay and the scriptwriters ought to be ashamed of themselves as well as the horde of idiots who have given this film a 10. I am shocked that Spielberg has had his name associated with such a pathetic excuse for a film. Wrestling fans: this is a must-see."

It was an enjoyable origin story that had a good dose of humour, action and spectacle. This movie hits a dumb note from the get go. What, we start of our film because a piece of the 'all spark' falls out of Shias jacket? Give me a, lame excuse for a movie, break. Que an unnecessary OTT gremlins meets transformers scene that goes nowhere. Que a stupid sub plot involving Shia's pornstar girlfriend that culminates with her catching him 'cheating' with a female terminator (sorry, I mean 'transformer human' or 'pretender' or whatever it was called). Cue a plot line so contrived and forced and daft that it boggled the mind. There are so many explosions and hard-to-make-out-who-is-who robot action that after a while you just become numb to it. A guy beside me was yawning was bullets and bombs went off near the pyramids - that's not the emotion you want with people watching an action film. These kind of films are as much about build up and suspense as they are about hardcore action and here the whole movie was just the latter. Less would have been so much more. Disappointing."
"arriva","4","24","51","21 June 2009"," A senseless mix of genres
","I've just left the movie theater so my impressions are as hot as possible. And I must confess that I have quite bad impressions even though I liked the first movie a lot.<br/><br/>It has to be noticed that this film has become a medley of cinema genres containing comedy, drama, lyrics, love story but this heterogeneous mixture conceals a primary genre. I've got a feeling that this film creators tried to appeal to preferences of every audience, but in the end they just torn the movie apart. I was shocked by the awful quality of the plot - but it's better to say I was shocked by a big number of sheer plot holes. Even though in the first installment of the Transformers the plot was quite coherent, logical and consistent, in the second film you see an event and a moment later, that past event is completely forgotten as if it hasn't happened and has no consequences.<br/><br/>BTW, about a genres medley. In the second movie the authors for no obvious reasons other than visual attraction borrowed plot findings of .. Terminator 3 and Jumper. Yes, these Transformers include a hyper-sexual woman out of Terminator 3 and space jumps out of Jumper. Alas, this teleportation wiped out the remains of reality.<br/><br/>Oh, I've forgotten to mention that the Transformers 2 sneezed the plot of the first Martix movie, where Mr. Keanu Reeves resurrected after his own death (even though that death was semi-realistic and virtual). Alas, the creators of the second Transformers turned the movie into a pure fantasy - after Samuel Witwicky dies, he promptly reanimates having talked to some robotic Gods. BTW, you'll be presented with pre-historic times and pre-historic .. Transformers Gods.<br/><br/>Proceeding with the topic of plot inconsistency and destroying the remains of reality, it has to be noticed that hostile robots having the advantage in a number and power, became kinda softies and couldn't defeat usual tanks and infantrymen with submachine guns (and a tiny group of friendly robots).<br/><br/>This film still has the ultimate goof of the first movie - to be exact in different scenes the same robots have different sizes. Also, there's an awful modish element of almost all modern movies when rapidly changing scenes are shot (shown) using a shaky closely positioned camera.<br/><br/>Having all its beauty and insanely expensive CGI (special effects), this film remained for me an insipid and senseless glitch."

","I was not born a transformers fan, I actually disliked the cartoon series of the 90's. I though they were ridiculous; however, Mr. Bay came along and grabbed our attention with his first Transformers masterpiece. We thought; how can it be better? Well just watch the second installment and everything has been improved. You will leave with a huge smile and will be left wanting more.<br/><br/>After the first installment i wasn't expecting much more comedy other than the parents of Sam; however, the twin brothers brought in a really well organized comic relief. Although they the duo did a great job at keeping us laughing, the parents , especially the mom, brought the most laughter. She is a character that can be seen as a real person. For example, she talks about Sam's early childhood embarrassments which we know our moms like to do so much. The comedy in this movie easily compliments its main focus: the action.<br/><br/>The action speaks for itself, it is very satisfying to see Optimus kick everyone's butt or how a huge battle unfolds in the middle of Egypt. I'll leave the rest for you find out. Don't want to spoil all the action.<br/><br/>Lastly I would like to ostracize all those ""professional"" critics. They are all old geezers that are stuck in the TV Land movie era. Don't let these people affect your decision on watching the movie or how to enjoy the movie. Do that for yourself and you will find yourself as a happy camper.<br/><br/>I will say this the acting isn't the best in the world, but who cares acting these days suck already.

The stuff most critic complained about was true and if Bay had humbled himself he would have gotten rave review from everyone including the critics. If he had even listen to half of what was said about the film, this movie would have probably won awards during the Oscar seasons. But no, bay is all ego and he made is ego ruin a great franchise...<br/><br/>The first movie was all eye candy. from the girls, to the cars, etc. but this movie was just long and boring. The movies started out decent but for some odd reason that i cannot put my fingers on, i didn't enjoy the film....I was bored to the point I fell asleep within the first hour, because nothing interesting really happened in the movie...don't get me wrong, there was action happening all the time, but there was no built or character development at all...while watching the movie i saw new transformers die on both side, and i kept thinking to myself, ""how come they didn't introduce us to any of these characters"".<br/><br/>Are you going to enjoy this movie? more than likely you won't, especially if you love the first and want the second one to be better."

","Dramamine and earplugs.<br/><br/>I was in the Imax theater to watch Star Trek less than 2 months ago, and I spent the 1st 5 minutes of the actual movie hoping the ringing in my ears would go away. The tinnitus was caused by less than 3 minutes' exposure to the trailer for the Transformers sequel. At least it was fair warning. I made it a point to see the actual film in a regular theater and avoided Imax's 12,000 watts of sound. As a result, I am not totally deaf, tho not for Michael Bay's lack of trying.<br/><br/>No shot in the film runs as long as 5 seconds, and the camera never stops moving. You think I'm exaggerating, don't you?<br/><br/>There are some giant robots who want to destroy the Sun and other giant robots who want to protect the Earth. Except for one old-fart giant robot who just wants everyone to get off his lawn, it's close to impossible to tell them apart. They spend a lot of time duking it out with giant whirly hunks of metal and lots of flashing, smashing, and of course transforming. Everything goes by in a blur, which I have to presume was intentional. Little humans run in and out of the carnage, and I guess we're supposed to care.<br/><br/>Based on product-placement fees and quantity of gratuitously destroyed vehicles, I strongly suspect I've figured out why General Motors went bankrupt.<br/><br/>Every now and again the movie slows down just a tad and people stop shouting over the din enuf that you can actually understand what they're saying, and they get off a couple of clever lines, enuf to save this calamity from my lowest possible rating.<br/><br/>Dramamine and earplugs.

"mikehill2005","3","23","49","22 June 2009"," Bad. Here's a character run down for ya.
","First of all I would like to state that I am not a hardcore fan of Transformers. I watched the show when I was very young but I grasped the main concept and knew most of the characters. I also loved the first transformers movie, that much that I saw it well over 5 times at the cinema (discount). Seeing my fave characters on the big screen was fantastic, even if they weren't completely accurate to their g1 counterparts it was great to see them live action.<br/><br/>So here comes the sequel boasting more robots, more action and a more faithful movie. Well they got the first part dead on. There's so many damn robots in this movie that they forgot to properly introduce them, or even bother with character development. The action is packed but it lacks heart. It's just a slugfest of CGI models dancing around with explosions all over, at least in the first one you could tell what was going on. Anyway enough of this, here's the run down for those people who want to know how the robots turned out.<br/><br/>Jetfire: An old robot that acts like an old war veteran. Insert old man gags here. Whines and moans for a good length of the movie constantly while hobbling around on his ""walking stick"". Teleports Sam and friends to Egypt somehow which is never explained.<br/><br/>Arcee: Seen on the introduction for a minute or two, appears at the end for literally two seconds before getting shot and never seen again. There's actually 3 of ""her"", again never explained. Her alt form(s) are motorbikes.<br/><br/>Mudflap and Skids: Meet the god damn stars of the show! These two wise cracking idiot robots get more screen time than anyone and are constantly making ""pussy"" jokes. Childish as hell. If you though Jar Jar was bad Ooooh boy you're in for a surprise! Makes you wonder what they were smoking when they decided to RUIN the movie with this duo.<br/><br/>Sideswipe: The new coolest looking autobot who gets seen here and there but again is never formally introduced. Shame because his design looks pretty cool. But no screw that, make way for the MUDFLAP AND SKIDS SHOW! What a waste...<br/><br/>Jolt: I didn't even see him once. I'm not even kidding, the wiki has details on him but I can't remember him at all.<br/><br/>Wheelie: Another comedy character who fills the role of the ""gremlin"" in this movie. Annoying as hell but at least he's involved in the story, unlike the twins.<br/><br/>The Fallen: The biggest cliché of the movie sits on a thrown practically throwing out orders to Megatron as if he was Emperor Palpatine's apprentice (he actually says ""my apprentice"" too... UGH). Apparently one of the ""Primes"" who can only be defeated by the ""Primes"", aka Optimus. As soon as Optimus is out of the way he flies to Earth only to get obliterated in minutes in the last fight.<br/><br/>Soundwave: HUGE let down for the many many many Soundwave fans. He sits in space as a big satellite and talks to the Decepticons. That's all he does. He sends Ravage down, who is kinda cool.<br/><br/>Constructicons: They form devastator, which can be seen in the trailer. The Constructicons themselves don't talk or do anything, and are there simply for the ""omg they combine into 1!!"" factor. He dies in seconds and has dangling metal balls. I wish I was making this up.<br/><br/>Others: Not even worth thinking about. Any other robots are there for only a brief moment, aren't introduced or anything. Instead the time that could have been used to introduce them are filled with more jokes and ""dawson's creek"" moments. I will say that Starscream is A LOT better in this, but seeing Megatron bow before another villain and call him master makes me cringe.<br/><br/>Don't get your hopes up folks."

","I saw Transformers 2 Revenge Of The Fallen last night. I had been looking forward to seeing it for months. Well, this is a car crash of a movie sequel, i mean even though i enjoyed the first one very much, i was still disappointed how different Optimus Prime, Megatron, Jazz, Bumblebee and Starscream all looked in the final movie compared to their appearances in the Genration 1 comic books. But my disappointment got bigger and bigger until i left the cinema consumed with a hatred for the makers of this vile garbage that i could barely contain.<br/><br/>To begin with, it starts with another gigantic, confusing battle in China (i think) there was so much happening in these scenes that it confounded my mind into a bloody headache. Optimus Prime and the autobots have teamed up with the platoon of soldiers from the first movie to go hunting down Decepticons around the Earth, so far so ho hum. The problem with this scene is that i couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon because of the way the Transformers motion around on the big screen during the action scenes, this was a problem i had with the original as well.<br/><br/>The narrative and the storyline were all over the place. I couldn't help thinking that the cast were hurrying through their scenes as if they were desperate to be somewhere else. Shia la Beouf is one of the worst actors ever to become a film star. Hes like a human version of Jar Jar Binks from Phantom Menace, honestly i wanted him to die horribly.<br/><br/>Megan Fox kept me going though, but lets face it, she knows why shes in this film and its not because we all think she has the same range as Jodie Foster and Meryl Streep combined, its because shes fantastic looking straddled out over a Harley Davidson thats why. Thank God for that scene alone.<br/><br/>The 'comedy' scenes stamped any potential this sequel had into the ground. What did the screenwriters think was so funny about Shia's mother running around his Campus high on Drugs? The dogs having sex on the couch didn't help either. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.<br/><br/>I honestly thought this would be a great follow up to the first movie the way Superman 2 or even Terminator 2 was to their originals, but boy i was wrong...absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>Cal."
"rmh22201","2","22","47","29 June 2009"," Bad re-tread of a great original
","Most of the other disappointed reviewers have said it all perfectly already: we came this movie enthralled by the original Transformers movie's CG effects, action and even to some extent the story! From the sequel I expected a movie building on these strengths, but sadly Michael Bay & Dreamworks settled on a crass re-tread of the original, and have ruined the franchise in the process. Revenge of the Fallen is bizarre pastiche of worn-out story lines, plot devices, character ideas stolen from the first movie, the Terminator movies, The Matrix, and interspersed with an unbearable number of stupid crotch-humor jokes.<br/><br/>In addition to the Autobots, Bay apparently decided it would be cool to have Fembots and Geezerbots. There is a Decepticon that can take the shape of a woman (What's the point of this? The whole story is that Transformers are machines, not people.) and one who's a crotchety old-timer Decepticon who conveniently decides to switch sides and fight for the good guys! (Again - are the Decepticons truly evil, or have they just gone over to the 'dark side' of The Force, able to come back again???) Mikaela was hot and capable in the first movie – an all-around heroine in her own right not to be messed with. This time she's a left-behind, tag-along girlfriend with no real independence, reduced to constantly nagging Sam about who will use the ""L"" word first.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, the action sequences, while exciting and cutting-edge CG, are simply disorienting. Shot way too close up, there are only a few battles where you can actually enjoy what's going on. Worse, Bay must have figured viewers who liked the macho, heart-pumping military promo clips from the first film (AWACS planes calling in tactical strike fighters, C-17 gunships banking over the desert to train massive fire on the enemy, etc.) wouldn't mind seeing them again almost verbatim, with identical soundtrack. He makes virtually no effort to come up with new material, only new extras. Then there are the truly awful and endless scrotum jokes and retrograde ethnic stereotypes. (Why the poor buck-toothed guy in the butcher shop? Why?!?!) Every time the action gets going, we have to stop for 5 more minutes of a humping dog, a humping robot, a guy getting tasered in the balls, or a view under the 'scrote' of a  Decepticon??? Sad. And yes, Skids & Mudflap are absolutely the worst degradation of a marquis franchise since Jar-Jar Binks. The final insult is the shameless set-up at the end for a THIRD movie. With ""The Fallen"" ""destroyed"" (or not?), Megatron slinks away with Starscream saying ""This isn't over yet!"" Mr. Bay: You earn the right to make a trilogy; you don't just take it for granted."
"maian1-1","4","22","47","27 June 2009"," Big metal men hit each other. For two and a half hours.
","I quite liked the first Transformers film. It was silly, over the top and featured a high rate of characters-to-explosions, which is par for the course with Michael Bay films, but also had some really stunning looking robot effects, albeit ones that you could only appreciate in production stills since they were never still or in frame long enough in the first one to be seen clearly, and it tapped into the sort of nostalgia for my childhood that I usually suppress. All in all, I liked it quite a lot.<br/><br/>Now we come to the second film and all the ingredients from the first are present and correct, but bigger and louder. We've got the robots (but more of them!), we've got the bullshit plot (but more of it!) and we've got the human characters (but more insufferable!). Shia LeBeouf returns as the moronically monikered Sam Witwicky, Megan Fox returns to drape herself over things and run in slow motion whilst displaying the emotional range of a mannequin on ketamine, and John Turturro is back for no real reason other than to show his arse again. This time around The Decepticons are searching for another lost artifact which would allow for their leader, The Fallen, to take his revenge on Earth. For some reason.<br/><br/>Yes, all the ingredients from the first film are present and correct, now in greater amounts. However, just because you can make a massive cake, doesn't mean it'll taste any good, and that is very much the case with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.<br/><br/>First off, the effects are, once again, very good. The transforming effects are still terrifically well executed, even though Michael Bay spends a little too much time highlighting them despite the fact that we've all seen them before. As before, though, you can't really see the robots most of the time because of Bay's ADHD editing and inability to keep anything in frame for any length of time. Unless its Megan Fox draping herself over something or running in slow motion. The action sequences, of which there are many, are largely dull and uninvolving affairs since they consist largely of the same sort of thing we saw in the first film, with the possible exception that this time the humans are not quite so useless at fighting against the Decepticons. There are some fights in the film that threaten to match the level of excitement created in the first film, the last 45 minutes of the film are surprisingly tense, but largely it settles into a rut of lifeless fight after lifeless fight.<br/><br/>This is largely because Michael Bay, as is his wont, frames every shot to be a money shot; every shot is bombastic, every shot is melodramatic and ever shot is overblown. Even Rainn Wilson, as Sam's professor, gets a low-angle dramatic panning shot when he is introduced. The problem with imbuing every shot with an equal level of importance is that it renders them equally meaningless and, to paraphrase an old Richard Herring routine, I found myself sitting there reacting in exactly the same way to moments of tragedy as I did to moments of excitement and humour; with the numb, deadened stare of Megan Fox. I just did not care about any of it most of the time and it really did degenerate into a case of things just happening, even the death of Optimus Prime failed to get any sort of response from me since it was presented in exactly the same way as Sam's mom getting high.<br/><br/>I suppose I should talk about the human factor in the film but there doesn't seem to be any point. All the actors are as good as they can be considering they are in a film in which no one, in the audience or in the crew, cares about them or what they do. It's all about the big metal men hitting each other.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that what is missing from Revenge of the Fallen that was present in the first film is the chemistry between LaBeouf and Fox. In the first film, Sam was a charming, awkward kid who pined after a girl who was completely out of his reach, and the development of their relationship, such as it was, during the first film kept me interested whenever the film moved away from the action. This time around, the two are very much together and there is no real sense that their relationship is in trouble, so that spark that they had in the first film is completely absent and makes the non-robot moments of the second film much less interesting than those of the first film.<br/><br/>I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy bits of it; there were some scenes that made me laugh, and some that were quite tense and exciting, but all in all it was an unimpressive attempt at spectacle that reminded me of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest; a bloated, overlong follow-up to a perfectly fine first film that begins, ends and leaves absolutely no lasting impression once the credits roll. Cue bad Linkin Park song."

"gtamob","3","22","47","26 June 2009"," Tedious Transformers action
","First off, let me start off by saying, I had high expectations for this movie, but sadly i was very disappointed. With a great cast, state of the art special effects and animation, all topped off with a $200 million budget, you'd expect a grandeur summer thrill ride at the cinema.<br/><br/>But all you really is get is a tedious, dumb action movie with weak delivery in these key elements- Comic relief, tension, emotion, and set up. throughout the entire movie maybe about 3 out of 30 jokes actually get a laugh out of you. The tension of fearing the death of a character during an action sequence isn't there. The emotion that Mikaela try's to show for Sam isn't believable.<br/><br/>Now the biggest complaint. As you can well imagine 2 1/2 hours of Micheal bay's mindless pyrotechnics can get a bit tiresome. Throughout the entire film nothing is set up to intensify fight scene or even switched up a little bit, it's all Shoot and bomb the big a** robots. My advice to Micheal bay, sit down and think before you make a movie. Please!"
"olga1403","4","27","60","22 June 2009"," What were they thinking
","I was looking forward what turned out to be one of the worst movie-going experiences of the year, I'm pretty sure its still gonna top the box office which sucks because that means Michael Bay will do a 3rd Transformers thus completely ruining the first one. I would gladly go back in time and see it on DVD later because then I would've had an option of stopping this torture of bad script and jokes which was just painful to watch (even Turturro seemed boring on screen after watching T2 for about hour and a half, probably a first for him) . The design of Autobots is still pretty amazing tho, and thats about the only good thing there was about it. The plot seemed very ordinary for the much awaited sequel, and instead of a couple big, charged battles there seemed to be about ten of them which took the wind out of the last time. I can't imagine willingly seeing this movie again."
"loreal_boy","10","19","40","24 June 2009"," Michael Bay is a douche, yet also AWESOME
","I'd like to say my 10/10 may have been an exaggeration, but this film is definitely an IMDb 8.<br/><br/>Most of the comments I've read have been justified, this film is over the top, there are limitless explosions and the acting is mediocre to poor.<br/><br/>HOWEVER...<br/><br/>One must remember that the basic premise of Transformers is about alien robots who turn into machines, characterisation and subtlety where never going to be the film's strongest points, let alone Michael Bay's. Nevertheless if you take this film for face value, i.e. the most epic summer blockbuster of all time you're in for entertainment not experienced since the dark knight. (I emphasise the use of the word entertainment).<br/><br/>I'll start with the plot, whilst some describe it as incoherent and confusing one must remember this is a SCI-FI film. Without ruining anything Orci and Co create a mythology to capture the titanic struggle between Decepticon and Autobot (involving yet not as philosophically interesting as Jedi and Sith). Whilst the human development throughout the film is weaker (and the acting doesn't make this any better), it's entertaining nonetheless, but I definitely think it's a strength to the film that it takes a back seat to the perennial clash between Megatron and Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>A common complaint of Michael Bay is his ridiculous cinematography and score, detached and unemotive at the best of times. However in this film it work, the panning shots and stylistic themes as the US military ""brings the rain"" definitely add the appeal of the film, it makes you feel like an excited 10 year after watching a rocky montage; excited about the action of the next scene.<br/><br/>Then there's the CGI... Many have ranted about it's awesomeness, whilst others have complained that it represents the worst of Hollywood. Both views are justified but one cannot help but marvel at the sheer elegance by which the robots move. The fight scenes could be better choreographed - there seems to be no consistency in spatial or temporal battle, but then again I remember thinking the same thing about Star Trek or the Dark Knight. I must say regardless of yours views on Michael Bay, the transformers franchise, or explosions (and there are lots of them) I think it would be impossible to come out of the cinema without a smile and thinking ""that was seriously cool"". It is definitely not a waste of time or money and I personally found the pacing absolutely fine.<br/><br/>To conclude, Revenge is an unapologetic Michael Bay epic. The scale and plot are at least entertaining, and at best ridiculously awesome. You could either love or hate this film, however if you try and appreciate it for what it is, you will feel 8 years old again, full of imagination and excitement. Bay captures the feeling of getting your first set of transformers and playing with them all day long in your bedroom, creating elaborate story plots and set piece battles. The difference is he creates a titanic bedroom!"
"Rooney101","1","21","45","1 September 2009"," Worst Film Ever!
","Michael Bay does what Michael Bay does best - He blows stuff up. Just look past all the explosions and Megan Fox and what kind of film do you have? Now i initially Loved this film, literally i was mesmerised by how awesome i thought it was, i saw it 4 times. Though then i came to my senses. Just look at the characters. Megan Fox is just a sex object in the film. There's absolutely nothing to her character, she's just something for all of us guys to stare at and drool over. It also rips off Smallville and Indiana Jones. Clarke sees symbol, and they actually went to the same place in Jordan where Indiana Jones was filmed to find the tomb of the primes. The plot is very poorly thought out. I mean a machine which harvests suns, what were they thinking??? Then there's when the big transformer which sucks everything up. Cars and everything else is being sucked into it and they 2 guys are running away from it without a problem. There's even a shot where a caravan is being torn to shreds by it though right in front is a table with cutlery on which remains perfectly unaffected and intact. Then there's the Matrix thing which resurrects anything. Why not just resurrect all the original Primes right there? It worked for Optimus and Megatron (who in the last film died and the commentary said something like 'the pressure that far below sea level will crush him'...obviously not. Then there's just awful mathematics in the film. 5 Transformers go down to resurrect Megatron. They kill one when they are down there, then Megatron gets resurrected. So still 5 of them right? No, you would be wrong as the human submarine detects 6 transformers coming to the surface. How did someone not spot this major error? Then there's Shia Lebouf who gets hit by an explosion and dies but then seems to go to Robot heaven and talk to the original Primes. He's a human who goes to robot heaven?!?! How did this happen?? In this scene Megan Fox says 'I Love you, you can't die' In just another scene which steals from The Matrix. The Fallen. Apparently a Wizard Transformer. Who Knew? Earlier in the film it said The Fallen was stronger than all the other Primes. So why would he be scared of the single descendant that is left? I mean he could just come down and do a load of wizard stuff and easily destroy him. Why would he wait to come down?? There are so many other things wrong with this film, such as not knowing who is fighting who most of the time, and the stereotypical racism issue etc etc It's even worse than the new GI Joe movie, and that is awful beyond belief, it steals from Everything!"

","The Transformer 1st was dumb, how could anyone expect the 2nd to be good one??? This member has best described the movie so I am just copying and pasting his comment, because I believe he is true. Anyone wit a little brain do not watch this movie, but it is meant only for brain less children, and making it a Box Office hit.<br/><br/>""When Shakespeare's Hamlet spoke of life being ""...a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury; signifying nothing."" he was actually referring to a Michael Bay film. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the movie equivalent of a 13 year old boy who has stopped taking his ADHD meds and overindulged on caffeine, sugar, video games and porn. It makes me wonder if Michael Bay actually is a 13 year old boy--the victim of a tragic case of arrested development. 13 year old boys also appear to be the target demographic that this movie was made for.<br/><br/>In Revenge of the Fallen the dialog mostly consists of people yelling inanities at each other and robots making expository speeches that attempt to provide some vague skeleton of a plot. The female characters are either soft-porn eye candy or blithering idiots. Or both. The violence is almost non-stop, interrupted occasionally by jokes which revolve around scrotums and testicles and oral sex and humping. The ethnic stereotypes are shocking. The homophobia is palpable. This film displays all of the tact, intellect and decency of a locker room full of pubescent boys.<br/><br/>Once the action kicks in, it is relentless. The battling robots are mostly incomprehensible blurs of motion and color and clanging noises. The music pounds. Guns and cannons fire. Jets roar. Things explode. The characters run and yell. It quickly becomes tedious, but it goes on and on and on like this. When it was over, I walked out of the theater dizzy.<br/><br/>The best part of seeing Revenge of the Fallen was when I left the theater, got into my car, closed my eyes and basked in sweet silence.

","OK- we all know the story, we all know its based on a mediocre kids cartoon, so let us let that be our guiding perspective, shall we?<br/><br/>The 2nd installment is practically identical in formula to the 1st but amplified to the point of boredom. The jokes are more plentiful (especially from Sam's mom who steals every scene),more cute pets (Mojo humps a Boston terrier), the girls are more sexy (gratuitous rear end shots, and slow-motion chest bouncing, and even a strip scene), the explosions are well uh.. more explosive, more Autobots, more story-telling based on the Autobot's history, more chase and battle scenes, improved audio FX.<br/><br/>Skip this paragraph to avoid spoiler. Instead of the all-spark being the threat its now a machine left here by the ""fallen"" in 1700 BC. Sam, having touched the all-spark, has the location of the doomsday device embedded his brain that can only be deciphered by an historic Autobot who has been deactivated in the form of a stealth fighter in a aerospace museum. Who wants the location? You guessed it, the Deceptigons and they are ruthless in their methods of obtaining it.<br/><br/>With all of this we get less character involvement, drawn out battles that play out way too long, and a rushed epilogue. Not a bad movie in any sense but numbing to the point of boredom due to relentless and protracted action. Some clever writing and story telling from a film of THIS genre, it carefully avoids clichés and sappiness, and posing is kept to a safe minimum, but a good 20 minute time trim would have helped enormously."

The questions of ""who, what, where, why, and how"" are something that Bay and his writers have no concept for. They threw you into the story (which is fine) but introduced dozens and dozens of characters you have never heard or seen before, but assumed that because you saw the first one you would ""just get it"" So many clichés to count or even remember. The whole ""kissing another girl you didn't want to kiss just as your girlfriend walks in the door"" oh but wait! She is a terminator...ER I mean transformer? Oh and your girlfriend stays mad at you for 5 minutes and that whole sequence has no bearing on the the rest of the movie or plot...<br/><br/>Then you meet some old transformer (who acts old even tho every other transformer in the last movie such as mega-tron is hundreds or thousands of years old is still in tip top shape) And also looks like one of those aliens in star wars the clone wars.<br/><br/>Oh! And the military has a top secret rail gun just thrown in there that can take out transformers in one shot (why didn't they use that before??) And don't forget in the temple where the ""matrix"" was that was probably explored by hundreds of archaeologists has a hidden room behind the first painting to the left that was never found.<br/><br/>and dozens of little robots that spoke like they were on the real world<br/><br/>My whole point being, its way too fast and has so many holes or UN explained situations and characters. Seems like there was never a story board even created.

It is an utter, and complete mess, an abominable and failed film-making exercise in all CGI and no character advancement.<br/><br/>It is a cocktail of explosions and over-use of CGI, and eon-old Hollywood clichés stolen from a collection of classics. Michael Bay has obviously forgotten his adequate storytelling since ""The Island"" and is now treading where horrible sequels tread... the land of all style, no substance.<br/><br/>Aside from plot holes, loop holes, and gaping crater holes spread throughout the film it is terribly edited. There are time-lapses, and untimely scene cuts, and inexplicable displacement of characters and robots all the time. It is as if Michael Bay decided to edit it on his own (which he has), and gave up when he realized what a churning, improvisational mess he had shot on set.<br/><br/>The acting is competent from all leads, aside from the mediocrity of Megan Fox, which has to be singled out. She is nothing more in this film than a vessel for cleavage, a tanned face with blue eyes. I don't know which one is sadder; Michael Bay's objectification of this girl, or her acceptance of it. Her romantic scenes with Shia LeBeouf feels like torture, force-fed and with less authenticity than the most tear jerking sequence in ""Pearl Harbor"".<br/><br/>Of course it all comes down to the material, since the script is an utter insult to those tireless people who toil and write everyday in the film industry. It is truly a marvelous piece of juvenile humor, chaotic action scenes and Michael Bay's genital fixation and toilet humor with robots.<br/><br/>All the characters are tanned from the 80s, all the girls are hot, all the men are wise cracking clowns and all the robots have stereotypical accents of either black or English men.<br/><br/>If you do one thing right in your life, do not see this film. <br/><br/>This is the zenith in the history of bad movies."

","Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the most desperate attempts I have ever seen made by a movie. Coming only two years after the release of the original Transformers I knew this movie was not going to be anything special, because a sequel that is pushed into completion within two years is never a good sign.<br/><br/>The movie begins with what we find to be an alliance between the military and the Autobots from the first film as they work together in an attempt to destroy all remaining Deceptacons on the planet Earth. I suppose this was a better idea than simply repeating the exact formula of the first film, but it's just handled very childishly. This entire idea leads up to a huge, explosion filled fight with some sort of giant wheel-bot, that after a few minutes seems to be giving the Autobots the slip (of course in a Michael Bay film a giant robot destroying much of a highway is easy to cover up by the government. Durr-hurr). But what's this? A military cargo plane is flying overhead and heroic music has kicked in! Can it be? My God, it is! Here comes the toy world's most beloved robot character, Optimus Prime! Only problem is that Optimus seems to think he's in a 1980s cop film, because I wouldn't be joking if I say the first thing he tells the tinker-toy from hell after parachuting onto it was ""Pull over!"" Great! Optimus Prime has now become RoboCop! By the way, get used to one-liners like this- they make up most of the movie's dialogue.<br/><br/>The military involvement is vague and they are, as is sci-fi tradition, failing to help in any way! Have you ever once seen a sci-fi/action movie where World domination seeking robots are brought down by machine gun fire? Makes you wonder what the humans are doing here in the first place! They're probably cushions for the robots whenever they fall- don't want those bright paint jobs ruined.<br/><br/>Cut through the opening credits and go to our loving family from the first film. These segments between Sam, his parents, Bumblebee, and Sam's mechanic girlfriend (played by more curves than brains actress Megan Fox) are something that totally turns to movie upside down whenever they occur. No longer are you watching a mindless Rock 'Em Sock 'Em movie, but you've gone into a sitcom I like to call ""That Robot Show."" Whether it be Sam's dogs humping each other or his mother randomly getting off on pot-brownies these segments will stoop to anything in vain attempts to make you laugh (as if the absurd action sequences aren't funny enough of a joke).<br/><br/>Speaking of vain attempts at humor let me move right along to perhaps the worst aspect of this entire mess of a film: The Twins. Where to even begin with these unpleasant charactersThrow Jar Jar Binks into a ghetto, blend him up and split him into two and that would sum up how incredibly annoying these characters are, and if their presence wasn't enough to bother you they've made sure to provide you one of the most offensive portrayals of African Americans you will ever see in today's big-budget films. These robotseven their design screams of racist stereotype. One of them has big lips, another has big ears, and one even has a gold tooth (!!). I don't know who approved these characters or this portion of the script during development but surely no rational being could have thought these characters to be a good idea.<br/><br/>We also have some shameless rip-off of what appears to be The Terminator as a Deceptacon has taken to form of an attractive girl who seems to have her eyes set on Sam. You know something tells me that if I had the ability to take the form of humans I would use myself in a lot more productive manner than being a tease for college boys at Princeton (which seems to be a party university according to this film).<br/><br/>None of the plot really makes sense other than to come up with as many cheesy one-liners and explosions as physically possible. When the bad guys chase Sam they don't pursue, or stalk him- they just choose to blow everything up at random. There is something called tension that even a bad film can pull off, and it does not involve constant wall-to-wall explosions. Go back to the first two Terminator films. Remember how intense it was to have our human characters in a factory where a deadly machine could be anywhere? This didn't involve any explosions, or gunshots, but it sure as hell managed to create tension and edge of your seat moments.<br/><br/>I'll admit to liking some movies that involve turning your brain down a notch, the first Transformers film being an example of this, but this movie just went too far. At two hours and twenty minutes I thought the first film was forty minutes too long and this sequel is only longer and much less comprehensible. Some people say these films are the exact same thing and I have to strongly disagree. In the first film you could find the characters enjoyable and sometimes even whimsical. This one everyone is a cardboard cutout. First film the special effects were enough to dazzle you. This one they are so elaborate and over developed that you often had trouble understanding what was going on! This movie is an attack on your senses, plain and simple, though it's bound to make plenty of money and a third film will undoubtedly be spawned I can only say that no one will be talking about this series five years from now. It is just a passing fancy, something pretty to look at, like the cars showcased in this movie. Only good part of the film is seeing the new Corvette Stingray."

","Don't let people fool you with this film, you are beter off putting a few toasters in your dishwasher and turning that on the racket and flashes constitutes this whole film the whole 2 hours of it! Where to begin with this trainwreck of a movie? The plot - passable but lame I do not want to spoil too much but just imagine pearl harbor + blackhawk down and you have your disaster of a movie. The script is predictable the dialog made me cringe. The American army rock beat every 3 minutes whenever a jet comes over is repetitive and lame this entire movie seems to rely on its CGI effects and explosions. Strip that away and you have a movie that has no redeeming factor whatsoever.<br/><br/>Whoever's idea it was to put ""gangsta"" twin robots in this movie should be transfered back to the commercial department for 50 cent. These are ROBOTS that are supposed to be INTELLIGENT. The endless trashtalk from them is boring and lame. The main autobots barely have any screen time and its just this mess of decepticons that pop up everywhere and apparently know how to build robots? I was inclined to not even put a spoiler tag onbut I am not even sure what this entire movie was about! I honestly cannot recommend this movie it ruined a entire franchise for me that i grew up with. Michael bay is great at effects and thats it. the entire movie reeks of it. He should stick ot what he is good at and stop trying to make such movies. The movie was long repetitive and boring. I felt like i was watching transformers 1 with just the desert scene in it. The Love scene between sam and mikiella was just so forced it made me think of all the criticism of Pearl Harbor.<br/><br/>If you did not like pearl harbor you will def not like this movie. It has the same flaws and weaknesses as the that movie. Whenever Bay is given freedom to do whatever he pleases it just... becomes bad."

But at least it has already out grossed T4, which was nothing more than a ripoff of the first mediocre ""Transformers"".<br/><br/>Transformers 2 is a movie which should be studied in film school as a case in point for how to make a terrible movie.

","'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen'. Not a great movie. I attended a screening last night, and all I can say is this is definitely not something I should've waited 1.5 hours in line for. Almost 800 people attended, and were very disappointed when not let in. They didn't miss anything but a piece of work pretty much only showcasing nothing but great special effects, and other stuff that you see in every regular movie.<br/><br/>This movie includes jokes that were not too funny, lazy writing, above average direction, pretty good acting, and a dragged-out story. It seems as if the people making this thought adding special effects would cover up for their other weak areas. They were wrong.<br/><br/>As for the characters/actors...I am SO glad Mikaela did more than stand around in this movie. She actually HELPED Sam. That is one improvement from the first movie. Shia Labeouf did a great job of making Sam much more mature and less naive than he was in the first movie.<br/><br/>Overall, not too impressed. Way below my expectations.

","I've voted a 6, which is perhaps a little low - maybe 6.5 - 6.8, but for me this was a little disappointing. What I really liked about the first one was that it was serious, with non- forced humour. This one for me was less serious, with terribly forced humour - it's the difference between Star Wars a New Hope & the Phantom Menace. In fact the difference didn't stop there, as just as Lucas put in the awful Jar Jar Binks, Bay/Spel put in two similar silly autobots - the names of which escape me. And to be honest, on reflection, that was another issue - whilst watching the movie I had no idea which robot was which. In the fight scenes it was difficult to tell them apart, it all looked quite scrappy - unlike the first one, where each robot seemed more individual.<br/><br/>Now to my main bug bear - and yes I know it's just a movie.... However, the pyramids, the red sea & Petra are no where near each other!!! It would take days to walk from the Pyramids to the red sea, and even longer to walk to Petra - I know, I've been to all of them!!! In addition Sam seemed at one point to be running through Karnak temple??? Luxor is even further!!! Things like this just don't make the movie seem credible & it's sad to think that kids are now going to believe all these things are in the wrong place. I certainly get the feeling that Americans (and I am very pro American btw), do feel that if it's not in the USA, then it doesn't really matter about the accents/locations - I mean for them if it's in the same continent then thats enough - however I think if someone came out with a movie that had the star running from the Empire State Building to the Sears Tower, then they'd think that was very silly and unbelievable - and they'd be right!!!<br/><br/>Overall I did enjoy it - but no where near as much as I did the first one, and part of me senses a Batman-esquire similarity, where we started with a couple of great dark moody Gothic Batman movies, but then descended in to comic-book tripe (Batman & Robin.... yuk...!!) - before it was rescued by Christian Bales latest excellent movies.<br/><br/>Please don't let this happen to Transformers... Make it more serious, non-forced humour - no stupid/camp autobots - and I think one slow-motion shot of Sam running is perhaps enough for one movie....."

","As being a transformers fan since I was a kid, I was looking forward to the first one Bay brought out. After watching it, I was happy. I wasn't thrilled beyond belief because I noticed many flaws.<br/><br/>One: I dislike Shia. I do not like his acting because he doesn't have much variety with his talent. Mostly the same fast talking-smart mouthed kid that he always will be.<br/><br/>Two: Devastator is not a tank.<br/><br/>The latter irked me the most, and I was excited upon hearing that Bay said the real Devastator would be in the sequel.<br/><br/>After a year of anticipation, I go to see it.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with sexual humor that got old after the first hour. Shia plays the exact same character, as if it was difficult for him. Lastly, Bay ruined Devastator for the second time.<br/><br/>I was in an okay mood with the movie because the special effects were unbelievable, Megan Fox was gorgeous as always, and I do enjoy seeing Optimus on screen. Near the end, this movie went straight downhill...<br/><br/>My only question for Bay: Since when has there been a Robot Heaven?<br/><br/>5/10 - and I'm in a good mood today."

Remember it's based on a toy line about robots beating the crap out of each other. Michael Bay does his usual trademarks shots but with more o.t.t action, it doesn't stop. The SFX are so impressive, you can see where Michael Bay used the money. The robots are very well done, much like the first but shows a more in-depth look at them transforming. The story is enjoyable and even thought it is 147 mins long, it flys by. Shia Lebouf is back as enjoyable Sam and Megan Fox (hottest women on the planet) shows off the goods. This is the best film of the summer. And yes, I loved Star Trek but i'm more a Transformers fan. Now, im off to watch the first film, again."
"julianselvage","1","18","39","29 June 2009"," I didn't like it- definitely not as good as the original
","Two years ago i missed out on seeing the magnificent Transformers on the big screen, and I swore that i wasn't going to miss out on seeing its sequel in the year 2009. Last night , I spent my $20 and watched it with a couple of mates. It was extremely disappointing. The movie overall wasn't that bad, its special effects were fantastic, but numerous mistakes got me puzzled which annoyed me right through it, and got me asking questions like "" hey, didn't that guy die""? and "" what team is that guy on?""...the whole movie was chaos! i couldn't take to any of the characters bar Optimus Prime which this whole movie was all about.This really ticked me off.<br/><br/>The movie ended up being a massive battle between robots throughout the whole movie, it didn't introduce any of the new characters at all, which really bugged me, because i didn't know what robots I was going for and who was who!. In a way, Transformers 2 isn't a sequel, but a whole new movie. It had many differences to the first, ie., Starscream's voice,personality and looks have changed dramatically since the first, and where we see at the end of the first Bumblebee's voice coming back and repairing, the second contradicts, with him again not being able to speak at all.<br/><br/>However my main annoyance was that the movie had lost its theme "" Transformers"". Unlike the first one, where we saw the Autobots transform in these neat cars and trucks, and the Decepticons change into the more rough cool ""tanks"", ""Blackhawk helicopters"" and ""police cars"", the Decepticons in T2 basically looked like massive ""terminators"" from the Terminator movie, not changing into any hectic cars or tanks basically at all through the whole movie.<br/><br/>The humor was rightly placed in the first Transformers and the jokes weren't that bad, but in the second they over-killed it, very similar to Spiderman 3. ie., the two dogs at the start where the camera focuses on them having sex ( this is transformers?), OK funny at first, but when the camera focuses on them again and again throughout the scene...it gets tedious, this joke is old and really isn't that funny.<br/><br/>Overall, his movie had its ups and downs, but the downs are definitely higher. However that saying, little kids would enjoy its special effects and action scenes greatly, although the the scenes like the dogs having sex probably attacks this target audience as well. The movie was also really too long.Rating- 5/10, definitely not as good at the original."
"rjyelverton","2","18","39","28 June 2009"," Bay's world is an over-caffeinated, ugly place
","For sheer movie-going value, you can't beat Michael Bay, a director whose films are so bloated, busy, and full of heroic imagery that you get an entire summer's worth of blockbusters in one sitting. But just like eating a large bag of Doritos eventually leads to regret and self loathing, sitting through an entire Bay film brings on the hate and it's hard to live with yourself in the morning.<br/><br/>Where to start with this regrettable extension of the Transformers brand? Like the similarly incomprehensible Jerry Bruckheimer produced ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"" ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is a globe-spanning bauble hunt involving shards of the All-Spark and the Matrix of Leadership all integral to the quest to cultivate much-needed Energon. With a script that is clearly an afterthought--a means to get us from Point A to Point B and to create an excuse for giant robots fighting--why make it all so complicated? All of these baubles have appeared in the Transformers mythology at one point or another, but does a franchise created solely to sell toys deserve slavish accuracy in its adaptation for the big screen? All that's gained is confusion and a few grins of recognition from devoted fanboys.<br/><br/>The Michael Bay aesthetic has not changed with his latest film. Every shot is a hero shot with a helicopter mounted camera view always preferable to a static close-up. In Michael Bay world there are no static close-ups. Every moment is as equally important as the next. There are no moments of reflection and calm before the action gears start turning once again. It's frankly exhausting and displays a profound lack of storytelling skill. His storytelling is further hobbled by his inability to establish visual geography. Visual geography allows a viewer to orient himself within the filmed space, understand the players involved and what's at stake. Bay just buys the largest fireworks display possible, lights it on fire and moves his camera from one point to another--never for longer than seven seconds.<br/><br/>""Revenge of the Fallen"" also displays clumsy attempts at humor including dogs humping each other, robots humping humans, and robots with testicles. Every woman in the movie is either a super model or lunatic and the film trades in unnecessary stereotypes. The two worst offenders are the jive talking Skids and Mudflap who have gold teeth, monkey shaped faces, foul mouths, and can't read. Bay's world is an ugly, over caffeinated place."
"george11520-1","2","18","39","26 June 2009"," Awful
","If you like Disney films, then this is for you. <br/><br/>Genres of films that base themselves on comics or cartoons always run the risk of straying too far from the concepts or story lines of their original medium. The first Transformers movie was getting pretty close to line-crossing in this respect, Revenge of the Fallen was walks over the line and disappears into the distance bound for Disneyworld.<br/><br/>Great CGI and special effects it is true, just not nearly enough Transformers or Decepticons. Instead viewers are forced to endure painful teenage romance story that has nothing to do with the original cartoon at all ... the humans in the original Transformers cartoons ... it was their job to look after the Transformers and repair them, that was pretty much it. Not ""you say the 'L' word"" ... ""no, you say it!"" .... wooden script writing for the human characters, maybe it is because the movie has no place for them. <br/><br/>I felt sorry that the machines were sidelined in favour of a trite and pointless sub-plot. Oh and the lovable little decepticon model 4x4? The type of movie-goer who thought Ja-Ja Binks added anything at all to Star Wars, is the same sort of movie-goer who will love the awfulness of the borderline racist twin robots. Gratuitous innuendo and pop-culture characters ... dull. This movie is only for the 12-20 year old set. That said, it will probably win a bunch of awards. I give it a 2 for the machines and special effects. I hope that John Turturro got paid well to be involved in this most juvenile of films. At least Megan Fox wasn't so orange this time around (ouch)."
"zylka-adam","5","18","39","25 June 2009"," Meh
","First, let me start out by saying that Michael Bay is a terrible, action/military whore of a director. He, along with the extremely dry acting of Shia Lebeouf and Megan Fox (yes, she is hot, but she can't act at all) bored me to death.<br/><br/>The movie glorified militarism, conservative politics and made Obama seem kind of evil by wanting to get rid of the Autobots, but what can you expect from Michael Bay? Not a whole lot, it turns out. In fact, the sweeping/swooping camera shots nearly made me sick. We get it Michael Bay- you like explosions and guns and military hardware. Good for you.<br/><br/>The CGI was just peachy as it blended in fine with the live action. However, I counted 10+ times where I asked myself ""WTF is going on?"" This was mostly during the fight scenes between the transformers, when you couldn't tell who was fighting who or how they were fighting. Additionally, every single one of the decepticons looked exactly the same (apart from the 'main' characters). Some identifying characteristics would be nice.<br/><br/>As far as the acting goes, I cannot take Shia Lebouf as a serious actor. Not only did he ruin the most recent Indiana Jones flick, but he whined his way through both transformers movies. His acting style is neither cute nor funny- just obnoxious. Also, he screams like a girl (which was expected I suppose). Megan Fox is a babe- too bad her acting is even worse than Shia's. She spends the whole movie providing eye candy (which is nice) and following around Shia Lebouf's character like a puppy dog, also taking the time to enjoy getting humped by a small robot. And why is every secondary character in the film have to be a comedian? Everyone, from the roommate to the ex-Sector 7 agent, has to be hilarious. Haha- alien testicles are funny. Good one Mr. Bay.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on plot holes and continuity issues because this would turn into a thesis.<br/><br/>This review isn't to say the movie was horrendous, but I'll be honest. I didn't care for the first film, and I care even less for this one. If you want a Michael Bay-style action movie, see this. If you are looking for something that is a good movie, skip it."

","I watched the late screening of this movie and wished I never bothered. I thought the film sucked big time and that George Lucas could have done a better job. What I found wrong with this movie was the poor story, the bad jokes and confusion around which Transformer who. Shia is a good actor and he and the CGI effects were the only saving thing for this movie. I don't expect a Casablanca or even BladeRunner but maybe to be on par with the first Transformers film would have been acceptable. My biggest gripe was that they didn't even use SoundWaves voice from the cartoon. He could have been any other robot stuck up in space for all that mattered."

I didn't use the spoiler alert because to be honest I don't think there's anything to spoil, Michael Bay has already done the spoiling.<br/><br/>Too long, too much comedy, almost ridiculous at times. Jive talking robots that cuss, a 'bot' with a walking stick, fight scenes that are at times more confusing than entertaining and a complete waste of the wonderful Megan Fox who seems to be nothing more than a glorified poster girl.<br/><br/>I don't need to say anymore really, it was my most anticipated movie of 2009 and I am totally gutted with the result."

","Transformers had potential to be such a great franchise. I loved it as a kid. It was my favorite cartoon to watch. I had a ton of the action figures. Loved it to death.<br/><br/>And then came the movies...<br/><br/>Now, I kinda liked the first one. I thought the visuals were really neat, but mostly I just thought it cool that they brought my childhood love to life (Yay, Optimus!). I excused the pitiful plot in the first one. But I should have been able to have had one in this second movie. No. I get nothing. Just another random scrap heap thrown together in a semblance of coherency (and failing pretty hard).<br/><br/>It would seem that most of the effort was spent making the visuals, which are quite amazing, I'll admit. And at first I believed that it would be okay just to see for the eye candy aspect (I'd read the horrible reviews before and was sad that it was considered so awful). I hoped for something though and went to see it. There's all this talk about reboots these days. I think Transformers is already in need of one.<br/><br/>There is a ""plot,"" but it's just boring and cliché. About 90 percent of the characters are cardboard cutouts and stereotypes. I didn't really feel there were racist robots in the film, though I can understand why some people want to believe it. Most of the humor is vulgar and asinine, the kind that 12 and 13 year old boys make up and repeat to each other over and over again. Halfway through the movie, I was bored, even though there was non-stop action taking place. But it's not even good action. It's chaos and confusion. You can't tell who's who. Some of the new robots weren't even given proper names or lines. I don't have a beef with the acting. I thought it was okay. But it couldn't save this sad beater in need of a date with a car crusher. Also, there was no suspense, no sense of threat or danger, and no emotion evoked where it should have been had.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD if you haven't already seen it. No, I take that back. If you must see it, go now. Seeing it once in the theater is at least cheaper than buying the DVD."
"TheXeroXone","5","17","37","14 September 2009"," A step above the first one
","That's not saying much mind you. In the original movie the transformers were treated like punching bags and punchlines. No real interaction with the story or other characters at all. This movie, in that respect, is slightly better, but while, in a few scenes, where the transformers are treated like actual characters, this movie also does some really dumb things.<br/><br/>The most glaring example of this added stupidity are the 4chan brothers; twin Autobots that do nothing but talk smack throughout the entire movie. The one scene where they aren't talking smack is so ridiculous, that its not even worth mentioning.<br/><br/>A couple of less impressive moments include a paper-thin Decepticon that somehow manages to hold onto and hide a large chunk of the cube from the first movie, a female Decepticon that transforms into a human female with a three foot prehensile tongue (the tip of which remains as a tongue even when she is in robot form, because the audience is not expected to know what the long appendage reaching from her mouth is referring to), and a tiny Decepticon whose most treacherous act is to hump Megan Fox's leg for far too long. Bumblebee's stupidity was seen in the trailer so it should come as no surprise when he starts bawling like a 3 year old that doesn't get its way.<br/><br/>Also the plot includes finding this key which five Autobot ""Primes"" died to protect by merely burying it in a pile of rocks and turning their bodies into the shrine which housed it. This ""sacrifice"" makes absolutely no sense except that Michael Bay needed, for the sake of the final fight, all the other Primes to die so that only Optimus Prime would be left to kill off the Fallen, which only a Prime can kill - its never explained why nothing else can kill this robot. Maybe its like the 4th directive from Robocop, I don't know. This is not a movie you can put a lot of thought into.<br/><br/>There are a couple of good things in this film. Soundwave makes regular appearances as a communications satellite and is never found out during the length of the film - which is surprisingly good writing. Also, Shia Lebouf is far less irritating in this film than he was in the first one, which is a major plus.<br/><br/>All in all, not bad. I was honestly expecting it to be much worse."

No wonder the complete acting is horrible too. The best thing is Ehren Kruger and Robert Orci got paid for this dunghill. And on top of it...Michael Bay! A puffed up rooster on his dunghill and he is clearly not aware of it!! There is no other explanation for this catastrophe. Even in the action sequences Bay is a gyp artist.

","I usually enjoy action movies with a good plot and in fact I found the first Transformers fun, fresh and entertaining. This second chapter however has nothing to do with the first, starting from the new ""look"" of Megan Fox, who was so pretty in the first movie, to the silly ""girly"" voice they used in Italy to dub her, continuing with the exaggerated use of special effects to the total detriment of the plot (if there was one in the first place), to the two silly Autobots. Geographically speaking, it seemed like Petra, in Jordan, was near Giza and Luxor (Tebes) in Egypt, while the three locations are hundreds of kilometers away from each other. Also, Giza is right next to the city of Cairo, but in the movie it looked like it was in the middle of the desert... And what about the Egyptian authorities? The final battle was taking place around the pyramids... but there were only a few Jordan helicopters! Just a lot of nonsense... Kind of reminded me of Matrix 2.

If it is for adults then holy cow they didn't offer up anything. As far as I can figure the writers and Bay put this together for males 18-25 who sit around in their basement in underwear playing with action figures. If that is the case then mission accomplished. It really is a giant piece of rubbish. My whole problem with this is man it could be amazing. Either for kids or adults. Just pick a direction and stay focused on it. You don't have to be perfect although shooting for that would be nice. But if you want to make an amazing Transformers then pick an audience and give that audience the best movie because what you are doing now is turning every crowd off. My kid loves Transformers toys (I never did as a kid) which is why we got excited about the first movie. But he found it boring except for parts and as an adult I found it even more so.

No one would make a case of the first ""Transformers"" to be a masterpiece by the strictest sense of the word, but whereas novelty and a candidly faux-retro approach fueled its success, Michael Bay's follow-up to the wildly successful cinematic spin-off to a popular toy line is, while not without its share of beguiling moments, an incessant revelry of excesses, fervently continuing the director's fetishitic shots of men and women wielding arms and highly stylized yet emotionally inept whack at human drama.<br/><br/>Picking up two years after its predecessor left off, the Autobots have teamed up with the American and British military in combating the remaining Decepticons on Earth who successfully revive Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) from the depths of the sea. Sam (LeBouf) is now off to college, but not before inadvertently bringing himself deeper into the ongoing war between the Transformers, and eventually finds himself scurrying past the ancient sites of Egypt and Jordan (oooh, Petra!) to look for the Matrix which will supposedly bring a dead Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) back to life and destroy an age-old enemy in the process.<br/><br/>Plunging at a breakneck pace such that characterization and human interest are obligatorily phoned in though never delved into (not that Bay and scriptwriters Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Ehren Kruger care), ""Revenge of the Fallen"" pointlessly barrels through the plotting not unlike its hulking metallic warriors without regard to narrative dynamics to support its cacophonous setpieces or to give more structural reason for its wanderlust-inducing locales. Bay, though at least soft-pedaling with the usual racial stereotypes, still fails miserably in callous mayhem and, less glaringly, in making his human characters more relevant, that under the pretense he's interested in fleshing them out, merely paints his latest would-be summer blockbuster with so much burnish that -- including the product placements and his veneration to Megan Fox's sexily tanned curves -- ""Revenge of the Fallen"" functions not unlike this month's glossy lad mag."

","I just don't get it to be honest. Why the hate? We all wanted more action going into the movie didn't we? Well i know that i did at least and the the story with Prime dieing and such i like it it brought a new flavor how could they defeat the Fallen without him made you wonder for a minute? Sam's earning the powder back to the piece ehh a little cheese cut from harry potter1. But the extra fighting and such was great!! more action new characters more comic relief i like it all it was just a fun family movie no need to critic everything that went wrong. I did not think there was any racism or anything just a good movie."
"AndyWarth","1","36","89","26 June 2009"," And to think that I didn't want to watch Dragonball: Evolution...
","Given the fact that there is no ""0"" nor negative scores on IMDb; I just went and raised a star on every movie I've ever rated here, because after watching T2:TROTF i honestly believe no other picture deserves a ""1"". This is the worst movie ever. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, the worst movie ever made. Normally I disregard trolls and people who just go and throw a random commentary like that, but now, I feel powerless beyond belief, beholding this crime against moviegoers.<br/><br/>Even if you thought the first one was good, this one is going to disappoint you to tears. If you felt N#1 was awful (like I did), this should be obvious; don't commit my stupid mistake; at least the first one had John Voight blabbering stupidity. Even though I feel happy because he isn't around this one to further tarnish his career, my heart bleeds for John Turturro, who's role here is even more idiotic than the one he had in numero uno. Not even Megan Fox's Bayesque cleavage and bouncing is a good enough reason to suffer through this.<br/><br/>Story? Plot line? acting? None. None that you can understand at least. Everybody is terrible, but specially the lead. Just wait till Shia starts acting possessed or whatever (man I wish I could kick his butt!) and claims that he just read a book in two minutes and found that ""Einstein was wrong"". Your IQ will go down just by hearing that. A special mention should go to the main character's parents, a couple of the utter-most imaginable annoyance.<br/><br/>OK, maybe you're saying ""hey man, you are a retard, you went and see Transformers expecting plot line??!! it's about FX!! Well, I'm not that naive of course, so that was my original thought. And no, not even what's supposed to be the movie's forte was good. Action was stupid and senseless, trying to catch moments of brilliance of far superior previous movies like 300. Na, here you have Devastator's Scrotum (textually), and a couple of the most racist clichés made into robots.<br/><br/>You don't believe me? well, just go ahead and watch it. Go and watch how bumble bee has been demoted to an even more stupid scoobby doo. Look how Optimus Prime has become a bully with a gun.<br/><br/>I just hope this flops at the box office. Not because I want Micheal Bay to stop making movies (even though I do), Not because I want these awful, awful 2 hours and a half of disastrous boredom to lose money (I don't really care). I want this to flop because that way, I would know there's still some notion of common sense around."

","OK so I went out and watched Transformers Revenge of the fallen WITHOUT reading some of the quite frankly, funny reports on this movie.<br/><br/>I wasn't all that impressed by the first movie which I think lowered my expectations somewhat for this second one.<br/><br/>OK, so there are some holes in the plot, there are some very cheesy moments, especially when Sam has an out of body experience with ""the primes"".<br/><br/>BUT!!! come on what do you want from what is historically a KIDS series and rated a 12a???? There are people on here banging on like they are all film critics, Michael bay this, Michael bay that! Its hilarious really.<br/><br/>Transformers Revenge of the fallen is a good action movie, plenty of action, Optimus prime actually does himself justice in this movie, not like in the first when he was quite frankly a bit of a wimp, there is plenty of humour to go along the way (which was greeted with laughter from the cinema crowd, always a sign people are appreciating the humour involved) and overall I didn't feel it felt like 2 and a half hours (suprising considering the speakers in the cinema weren't working completely so we lost some of the surround sound effects!!) And and Megan Fox is just Hot, and who doesn't want to look at that!! Overall. I don't think this movie is a 9, but I rated it as such because of some of the pathetic reviews on here. Its more a 7.8 which is still a good movie. If you want action and light humour, go see it, you'll enjoy it, and ignore some of the would be film critics on here. And remember, its a 12a.......... :)"

"TheAoiDoragon","2","16","35","28 June 2009"," Nice Effects... What Else?
","I was forced into seeing this movie and basically, I want my 2 and a half hours back and I want my hearing back.<br/><br/>I like movies with action and that isn't what the turn off is in this movie. This movie seems like ALL they did was focus on the Special Effects and nothing else. I like movies with a story and depending on genre, a deep and thought out one. In this case, this movie was much like Terminator: Salvation. Only in T:S, there was good acting.<br/><br/>The machines are smart right? Wrong. They have the worst dialogue I have ever heard. Well, not actually. They had terrible dialogue. Shia LaBeouf was more interesting then the machines, and that (in my opinion), is saying something. He isn't the best lead.<br/><br/>I have to hand it to Michael Bay, the effects were very nice, but he wasted a ton of money. He just seemed to focus on the effects. This movie was missing everything needed to be a movie. A shame. Michael, stop blowing things up, make a story first, then blowing things up will be much more rewarding.<br/><br/>2/10"
"spaceghostsg1","1","16","35","24 June 2009"," Worst movie since Matrix 3
","This was a Truly terrible film. After seeing this film, I asked all my friends (who saw the film independently) to rate the film out of 10. It scored and average of 2.5<br/><br/>I'm not even kidding about this - please do not watch this film. It was appalling. One of my friends suggested he'd have a better time going to the see side and hurling 10 £1 coins into the sea!<br/><br/>OK, so why's it so bad? MICHAEL BAY like all humans loves money. No effort was put into script writing. The dialogue was appalling... I think my least favourite aspect of the film was the introduction of 2 ""gangsta"" autobots who tried to talk like they were ""from da hood"". AWFUL!!<br/><br/>There was a joke at the end pertaining to the testicles of a decepticon. One of my friends compared it to going to see a stand up show where the comedian defecated on the audience for 3 hours then told a knock knock joke. It got no laughs whatsoever. In fact, about 1/3 of the audience were asleep at this point because of 30 minutes of BORING fighting.<br/><br/>I think the CGI and action scenes took a turn for the worse in this movie. Also: there was no suspense, unlike in Transformers 1. Anything that was good about Transformers 1 has been removed to make this movie.<br/><br/>After the first movie, the 2 main comments to Michael Bay were:<br/><br/>1) REMOVE THE HUMANS and 2) FFS, PUT PRIME'S MASK BACK ON!!<br/><br/>So Bay responds by keeping Prime's TERRIBLE lips and adding more useless humans to the mix. As if that's not enough, he introduces some new transformers that talk like gangstas. The introduction of these robots made me so angry, I felt sick. I like my giant robot battles to be serious and dark (like the trailer suggests). Thanks false advertising.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I can continue with this review without getting SUPER cross. Please, just do not go see this movie. If you're curious, wait until it is out on DVD and download it. Do not, under any circumstances, pay money to view this movie. You'll feel robbed and almost certainly demand your money back!"
"nijhel","4","16","35","24 June 2009"," Too boring, too off-mark and too drawn out
","I honestly thought this movie could have pulled things off in an hour and a half, maybe even an hour and ten minutes. There were too many unfunny comic reliefs, the sidekicks were off- mark and the entire movie is TOO long.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoy watching Optimus Prime and the Autobots kick ass. I thoroughly enjoy Decepticons and their numerous gizmos. But serious, some Autobots and Decepticons didn't even get names, and if it wasn't for their size difference I wouldn't have been able to tell whether the Decepticons were Transformers or Terminators. There's THAT MUCH character to the individual Transformer. Even Prime seemed uncertain and wavering in this sequel.<br/><br/>And the comic reliefs. They may have been hilarious for soft porn lovers, but they simply didn't cut it for a movie directed at young adults trying to catch a ride back into good old Transformers and young children who would have been looking for TRANSFORMING ROBOTS.<br/><br/>Plus Bay never fails to put in as much kickass American MILITARY PRIDE in his movies. I'm not even going to comment on this; it's the guy's right as a director to do what he will to his movies, but I honestly don't think it'll sit well with many of the audience.<br/><br/>Oh, did I mention that the movie is too long? I went into the movie theatre expecting nothing from the story-line (I mean, I was there to watch robots blow things up and get blown up) but the glaring plot-holes carried on and on and on and on....hanging out like some serpentine tongue. Yeah. That's right, serpentine tongue. I dare you to watch the movie and find out."

A complete lack of understanding of military tactics and hardware. <br/><br/>Bad acting, sure. But with such a bad script and directing, it is hard to tell.

","I'm sorry but I cannot find anything positive to say about this one... An hour after the start I wanted to leave the cinema but then I decided to see how bad this can really get - and I can honestly say that I haven't seen bigger trash in years! I used to be a fan of Transformers while younger, and believe me - the cartoons were way more serious than this one, even though made for kids. Cheep thrills! Mindless action and explosions, stupid jokes at best, totally predictable scenes and unoriginal ideas. On top of that, in your face all the time - the hot chick Megan Fox, looking unreal in every scene (in the middle of exploding buildings, the desert sand etc), boobs jumping all around and everything - it just shows how they tried to make it up for the poor plot, and it starts to get on your nerves even if you're a horny teen.

"Donatien3","7","14","30","25 June 2009"," Spectacular, but too long
","Before the film's release, Michael Bay promised the Tranformers sequel would be bigger than the first, and he's delivered on that promise: 'Revenge of the Fallen' has more action, more Tranformers and lot (lot) more explosions. Unfortunately, it's also too long, at 2 1/2 hours. While there are are the usual cringeworthy ""comedy"" scenes (like Sam's mother ""accidently"" buying hash cookies and running around Sam's campus stoned) and some bad dialogue, the length is the main problem. Sure, a 2 1/2 duration worked for a complex film like 'The Dark Knight', but it doesn't work for ROTF. While the transforming, multiple explosions and robot battles are cool in the first half hour, they start to wear thin after two hours, especially as it can be hard to tell the Autobots and Decepticons apart during some battle scenes.<br/><br/>The majority of the cast reprise their roles from the first movie, including Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime. Aside from Optimus, the most sympathetic Transformer is Bumbleebee; while he can't talk, he expresses his emotion through body language and his stereo. The relationship between Sam (Shia LeBeof)and Bumblebee is sweet and funny, and more believable than the main human romance between Sam and Mikaela (Megan Fox).<br/><br/>That's not to say ROTF is a bad movie. It's exactly what it claims to be: a big, spectacular action/popcorn blockbuster, with more emphasis on blowing things up than an intricate plot. It's the kind of movie you could lose yourself in for two hours, a pure fantasy experience, but a long one."

SOOOOOOOOOOOO many problems where to start? ummmmm OK how bout <br/><br/>1.OBAMA hates auto-bots! Thats right for some reason they have to bring him up in this movie and i'm guessing hes the same president that wants to kick the auto-bots off the planet? <br/><br/>1A.Then again I think Obama is onto something because it seemed to me that it was the humans that were doing all the killing. but to be honest and fair i couldn't tell the good robots from the bad robots.<br/><br/>2.I could probably count about 5-10 ANTI IRAQ WAR, 9/11 mentions in this film!<br/><br/>3.Ummmmm how many scenes in this movie were used from the first movie? bumble bee dropping his ""fight visor"". the footage of the predator drone. the same exact Iraqi village used in the first one. Then I knew the same footage of them in the AWAC was coming up and it did! Sheia having to run a gauntlet in the end..which was probably the longest 1 mile run in the history of the planet! i think i could of walked the mile faster. hey they did replace green smoke with orange smoke this time! <br/><br/>4.What was the exact point of the fallen one? to make a splash landing and destroy a 5 billion dollar aircraft carrier? man hes got great aim coming from another planet landing smack dab on the flight deck! <br/><br/>5.So the fallen one announces to the world they aren't alone? Then proceeds to put a bounty on Sheia's head? wow what a plan! i know if that fails we will take his parents hostage and then spring a trap! <br/><br/>6.Loved the stereotype black guy auto-bots even down to the gold teeth? these 2 could have possibly killed a franchise ALA ""jarjar"" <br/><br/>7.Could the college roommate get any more annoying? Every other scene he's crying and complaining! Then he gets tasered passes out then 30 seconds later hes up and running around? <br/><br/>8.With all of the technology the USA has at its hands and the biggest threat to the world they don't realize that there's a giant alien robot attached to their main military communication satellite? <br/><br/>9.Megatron says that its time to come out from hiding and show the people of earth no mercy? then proceeds to only knock off the flag on the Brooklyn bridge? <br/><br/>10.Just think how far along we would be if archaeologists thought to look behind that wall in the temple? Or you would think they would of detected a big alien device in the middle of the pyramid? <br/><br/>11. Sector 7 guy is able to reach a battleship off the coast with a hand held walkie? when they go to great lengths to stress that the marines with all their great tech are out of communication?<br/><br/>12.

However, I am very disappointed with the amount of sexual content as well as foul language. It is obvious that this is going to be something that children watch, I mean there are action figures for goodness sakes.

"zkonedog","8","3","4","8 March 2017"," Not A Let-Down
","After the rousing, somewhat unpredictable success of the first ""Transformers"" film, Michael Bay and Co. set out to capture that winning formula once again in ""Revenge of the Fallen"". Despite much critical panning and even outright derision, I cannot understand why this would be consider a let-down in any way, shape, or form.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Transformers 2"" sees Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) entering college and leaving girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind. When the Decepticons cook up another evil plan to destroy Earth, though, it isn't too long before Sam and Mikaela are once again teaming up with the Auto-Bots (as well as the U.S. military) to once again save the world.<br/><br/>Simply put, this is the classic cinema case of ""same concepts, different packaging"". The amounts of humor, pulse-pounding action, and plot (or lack thereof) are pretty much the same as the original, but director Michael Bay is able to keep the proceedings remarkably fresh. Never once did I feel as if things were becoming ""old hat"".<br/><br/>The key to enjoying this franchise (and even more so this film in particular) is this: have the ability to not take it seriously. If you view these movies as strictly ""escapism"" entertainment, they will entertain you thoroughly. Do they hold up to dissection? Heck no. But that isn't the point.<br/><br/>As usual, LaBeouf pretty much steals every scene he is in as the young Witwicky. He has the type of acting talent that perfectly meshed with the numerous ""just passed adolescence"" characters he played during this time period, and this makes Sam very relatable to the audience.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed ""Revenge of the Fallen"" nearly as much as its predecessor. While the ""newness"" factor may have worn off a bit, this second effort (if viewed in the proper light) repackages the key elements of part one and lets us enjoy them again. Despite all the negative publicity about this one, the Transformers fan who can fully immerse him/her self into the experience (without too much ""thinking"") CAN still have a blast watching this one."

But in Transformers, why do I care about plots that are intelligent? I am watching it for robots smashing each other. That is one thing a critic is never going to know. If Transformers has a twisted, dark and complex plot and the robots just appearing in a few scenes, it won't be called Transformers. Transformers means fun, explosions and robots. The music is even epic. Explosions are cool. The cast are hot. The director is insane. But one thing I do not like is that it has too much comedy and some lame characters trying to funny.<br/><br/>Overall: It is a good summer movie. Take a break from watching the usual genres, and watch something different. What is not fun seeing robots destroying everything in their path? Let see if G.I Joe is as successful as Transformers. Maybe not."

","Sorry to say that, but Transformers 2 - Revenge of the Fallen is one of the worst films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>When I saw the first episode, I was a bit disappointed. I never knew the world of the Transformers, I mean as a child I had one or two Transformers Action Figures, but I didn't know who they are or where are they from... you know. I watched the first Transformers movie and apart from the great visuals, it was a bit lame film. It was full of lame jokes, and that whole Shia LaBeouf-Megan Fox storyline was unnecessary. I thought that time that it was a bad movie.<br/><br/>BUT - then came the 2nd episode: Revenge of the Fallen.<br/><br/>The trailer of the film was pretty good. I said to myself: ""All right, I'm gonna watch the movie. The first episode wasn't so good, but I'm gonna watch the 2nd movie; it's worth it because of the CGI."" So I watched it...<br/><br/>My God, it was awful. It was a hundred times lamer than the first one, the LaBeouf-Fox storyline was a thousand times more unnecessary than in the first one. And the worst part of it were the ""new"" characters like that annoying guy from the university and ""the Twins"". They were the worst characters of Motion Picture History. The jokes were terrible, the scenes were awful, and because all of that the CGI was unenjoyable! It was a terrible experience and a waste of 2 and a half hours.<br/><br/>Just DON'T watch it."
"LoverOfGOODMovies","1","15","33","25 June 2009"," Guide to enjoying this film as a G1 fan
","STEP 1 - Forget everything you ever knew, loved, or cared about regarding transformers. This step is important...so don't be lazy...erase every single little detail from your brain as far back as the first glimpse of the Autobots on Cybertron before they even crash landed here. Forget Rumble, forget Rodimus, and just pretend you've never even heard of the transformers before. <br/><br/>STEP 2- Go see the movie in a small town. Some place where they still charge $6.50, like Austin or middle of nowhere California. <br/><br/>STEP 3 - Pretend that you are going to see a one of those ""Scary Movie"" type of films that combines elements from eighteen other movies and franchises to make one funny, and somewhat disgusting film (i.e. the twins and john tuturro's naked ass).<br/><br/>STEP 4 (final step) - Whenever in doubt, just stare at Megan Fox."

","Oh yes my friends. Never has a movie been soo long, had soo many special effects, been soo expensive, been soo hammy and been soo utterly utterly rubbish. Not since Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>If this film had been 70,80,90 minutes, maybe I could see the fun side of having robots shoot at other robots, as well as Megan Fox's anatomy in gratuitous slow motion without any discernible hint of a plot or acting talent. But oh no. This weighs in at over 2 hours. I was literally in slack jawed amazement it was still going on 120 minutes in.<br/><br/>This movie was definitely aimed at the under 12s. If you enjoyed this movie you probably fell asleep till 10 minutes before the end, or have been recently lobotomised."

","Transformers 1... Absolutely amazing. Ticked all the boxes with the action and the plot, the 'all spark' gave the story momentum as its what propels the deceptacons to fight and the Autobots to defend it. The film had it all and therefor it set a very high standard.<br/><br/>In Revenge of the Fallen we see all the hype and intensity disintegrate into a shambles of fake love scenes and silly fantasies. It all came down to age... The first was a 12a however featured adult comedy and action which was mixed with child themed scenes. Transformers 2 features ALL child comedy and action. It became obvious it was for a younger audience the moment we see the big plot (stupid matrix and bad guy) These make it very silly.<br/><br/>In total a very bad Transformers with almost a WALL-E Plot to it. Acting was very thin and the SFX were stolen from Terminater Salvation. Whoever says this film is the summer blockbuster clearly has no taste for real acting and a quality storyline."

","Now I know people say only amateurs' rate movies by either rating them 1 star or 10 stars, but I have to give this film 1 star on the bases that it is the worst film I have ever seen. I know some people will disagree but the films plot is extremely stupid and predicable (there are porno's with better plots). On top of that even massive sci-fi fans will be left thinking 'yeah right'. And the thing that is supposed to be the best part of the film, the special effects is not that great even with the master of cheese Steven Spielberg directing it.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone below the ages or mental age of 8."
"dbborroughs","4","35","89","28 June 2009"," Its all visuals since the poor excuse for the plot and alleged performances by the actors make this tough haul
","One of the most spectacular films ever put out, it has some truly amazing sights that boggle the mind, more so since they are so clear and sharp in exactly the way real life never is. This is eye candy of the highest order and it will blow your mind.<br/><br/>The question is will you have any mind left after watching a film that is so badly written and so poorly acted (with the exception of John Turturro) that its best if turn off your higher functions and just watch the pretty destruction? I don't know. Clearly we haven't moved beyond the concept of bread and circuses when it comes to entertainment, otherwise how else would you explain the huge take at the box office. This is one of the worst written films I've ever seen, and if you've read any number of the reviews I've posted then you know I've seen some real dogs.<br/><br/>The plot has something to do with the Desepticons wanting to get their hands on a power source that will allow them to take over the universe and Shia LaBeouf has the key. Lots of destruction happens as a result and everyone ends up in Egypt (but not before we get lots of slow mo cheese cake shots of Megan Fox). I would try to mention the holes in the plot but that would assume that there really was one and not something scribbled on the back of a napkin. I also will not get into the lack of internal consistency and internal illogic since that would be like hitting one's head against a wall for a week. (And I won't get into the steals from other films and TV shows)<br/><br/>Then again plot isn't why this movie exists its the robots and Megan Fox. Those two things are the reason this movie is making a mint since its the two things that most 12 year old boys are most interested in.<br/><br/>I will say it is infinitely better than the first film, the writing is worse but the action is better. See it with a great picture and you'll be wowed. I vote waiting for DVD where the remote will help you get past the exposition scenes that make the film two and a half hours film like two and a half weeks."
"shootfromthehipx","10","13","28","24 June 2009"," Let's be real...
","Most of the reviews I have read about this movie have expected it to be some sort of relevant cinematic masterpiece on the level of an Oscar-worthy picture. What these people don't seem to understand is this is TRANSFORMERS, not a movie about some sort of serious political issue from our past.<br/><br/>Transformers: RoTF is a movie bent on showing the combat and rivalry between the Decepticons and the Autobots - it isn't intended to have some complex plot and story line. The robots are truly the stars of the movie as they are the premise of the film and they are the reason it exists in the first place. The (human) characters lack some pizazz, of course, because this movie isn't about them.<br/><br/>Personally, I cheered, laughed, and loved the f*ck out of this movie. Yes, I did. Do I feel like it was some sort of brilliant piece of cinema? Of course not, because it wasn't intended to be this years Slumdog Millionaire. This movie delivered exactly what 99.9% of the movie-goers and fans of the Transformers expected - unadulterated robot destruction, crude humor, and of course, a scantily-clad Megan Fox.<br/><br/>There are racist stereotypes in most movies this day, any one who takes them seriously needs to realize this is a movie - oh my god they called a woman a 'b*tch' - I'm a woman and I wasn't offended by that at all. As for the 'Twins' racist stereotype, all of the African-Americans I saw in the theater were laughing along with the rest of us.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie was an amazing piece of just pure action and I felt like a 5 year-old kid as I skipped out of that theatre with a grin on my face."

I loved the 1 liners! I loved how some of the action scenes were set in slow motion, to show just how the decepticons/autobots ""finished each other off"". I loved Jetfire and the twins! Some people are offended by the twins, but they are definitely 2 of my favorite characters! I enjoyed the amount of transformers in this movie as opposed to the first. It's not as good as the first, obviously because that was the introdcution and the beginning of the Transformers, but it was wayy on up there! I will definitely be seeing it again! :)"

Only Avatar may surpass this film in the visual effects department.<br/><br/>Despite what you may have read on these boards, they're wrong about the film. They're expecting an academy award movie from a title that says ""Transformers"" in it. I mean, common, get a grip on reality people, this movie was great, you're just hopping on the hate bandwagon because you think you're a true fan, but I know you're not, don't lie to yourselves.<br/><br/>Anyways, go see this movie, it's a fun, action-packed ride that will make you want to see it again and get it on blu-ray. I know I'm buying a copy of this excellent movie on blu-ray whenever it hits stores. Also, if you guys happen to have a copy of the first movie on blu-ray, then check out the bd-live section for new special features.<br/><br/>Otherwise, go see this movie, and don't bring your kids, it has swear words and sexual jokes in it, which are very funny by the way. Michael Bay has yet again, made another great film for everyone to see..well not everyone, especially the people of IMDb.com to say the least. 10/10 for the perfect summer movie. Terminator 4 is on the same level as this, but this one surpasses it just by a bit. Watch it in IMAX."
"cihank1","1","11","23","15 October 2009"," You've Gotta Be Kidding Me
","Just watched the movie (better late than never, eh?). Being the sharing kind of guy I am, I wanted to point out a few of my opinions about this train wreck.<br/><br/>1) The trademark Michael Bay camera is, as always, all over the place - even in the scenes where there's no action at all! Characters talk about stuff and what does the camera do? It moves around them non-stop! At the end of the movie I felt like I had ridden a bad roller-coaster for too long.<br/><br/>2) I enjoy a romantic movie every now and then, especially with a girl next to me. Bu I'm sick to the bone with seeing romantic twists in all kinds of movies. In ROTF our heroes are saving the world from evil robots and they still find the time to have a relationship, complete with arguments, fights, jealousy fits, and all that. What the hell!?<br/><br/>3) I have no objection for pretty girls strutting around in movies, but there is a limit to that. Apparently M. Bay doesn't know about this limit. There are way too many half-naked girls in this movie. Especially the dorm Sam moves in looks like the Playboy Mansion more than anywhere else.<br/><br/>4) Action movies don't necessarily have strong stories; that being said, this movie's plot manages to insult a 5-year-old's intelligence. They spend $200 million and still can't write a decent story? How hard can it be?<br/><br/>5) Of all the stupid things in this movie, there are actually two robots, twins to be precise, who talk and behave like stereotype Afro-American gangbangers. Apart from being extremely insulting to black people, why would robots do that, even if they could? For crying out loud, what is the logic behind this?<br/><br/>6) I am aware that history is written by those holding the pen; that being said, I've had enough of watching American propaganda in Hollywood movies. In ROTF, the U.S., once again, saves the world. Americans bravely fight and sacrifice themselves while the rest of the world sits on its butt. U.S. war machines roam the skies, conquer the seas, dominate the land, and as always people from other nations live in mud huts and breed chickens. Get Real!<br/><br/>ROTF is a disappointment, through and through. If you like watching endless special effects hour after hour, can listen loud, tuneless action music without having a headache, and have a strong stomach for M. Bay's shaky camera, than go for it. Otherwise avoid it like a pile of nuclear waste."
"craigyjs","8","11","23","18 June 2009"," WARNING MAY CONTAIN SOME SPOILER INFO ! First half amazing second half to Much going on ,effects out of this world!!
","Im Fresh out of the cinema after seeing the first screening of transformers!<br/><br/>Im a massive fan of the first film and couldn't wait to see the second one. The first half of the film starts of straight into the action with amazing effects and awesome fight sequences. The humour in the first half is great and balances out the cgi fight scenes really well. With Sam's mother playing a more comical character than the first film. We also get introduced to the new auto-bots but sadly don't get to much involvement with them apart from the 2 twins. It would have been great to get a little more out of sideswipe and arcie although sideswipe does pull of an amazing fight move off within the first 20 mins. <br/><br/>After a breath taking first 15 minutes the story is the set in to motion with SAM finding a piece of the all spark. Without giving to much away the film progress's on nicely adding more jokes and delivering us some great special effects of the new decepticons with new tricks up there sleeve. Soundwave and Ravage are particularly good and love the fact that the original voice from the cartoon is used.<br/><br/>By the middle of the film everything is looking great, the acting by Shia and Megan worked really well and there looked a good chemistry between them. Megan if possible looked even hotter than the first film ( wow shes fine!).New characters and old ones from the first film have now been introduced. We are also wowed with some great fight scenes with optimus prime taking on three decepticons in an epic battle in the woods. This scene for me personally was the best throughout the film and completely jaw dropping, Michael bay had certainly geared up optimus primes hand to hand combat to make him look more like the ultimate auto-bot.<br/><br/>After this i found the films story went a little down hill as it started to seem a little to long and lost some of the humour and magic of the first. We still get introduced to some amazing new decipticons such as devastator, the design and cgi of which cannot be rivalled. <br/><br/>Towards the end of the film i was starting to feel to much had been crammed in with to many robots and explosions happening all at once, and i couldn't really focus on what was going on.I began to think that the movie should have ended half an hour ago. I did love however some of the old reference from the very first Cartoon transformers movie such as the matrix of leader ship ( Yes i still remember the cartoon film ..it was awesome!!).<br/><br/>All in all this is a great film with special effects to wow you throughout. I don't want to criticise to much as i think Michael Bay did a brilliant job on the first transformers (my favourite film of all time) and had some totally awesome ideas for this second film. I think the film could have just benefited by toning down the second half slightly, shortening it and bringing back the spark of the first half with maybe a few less robots and explosions.<br/><br/>I would still definitely recommend watching this if you liked the first film or love all out cgi action films in general then you will greatly enjoy this."

","Can someone explain this movie to me? Don't tell me the plot, I know the plot, what there is of it. Just tell me what I saw.<br/><br/>It's one thing to create a movie with a lot of special effects, but when you sit in an overly long movie, you hope that the plot makes actual sense.<br/><br/>Sitting through the the movie, I continually asked myself, ""How can you explain that?"" and ""Why don't they just...?"" Needless to say, I'm depressed that I spent money to see this. I put money in Michael Bay and the producer's pockets."" That will encourage them to create more of this tripe."

","This is arguably the worst piece of trash that I've seen in along time. Was dragged to the theater and put my fake smile on, hoping to make the best of the experience and to see a bit of action. All I can say is, could they maybe have included a bit of a storyline?!?! Every scene was action after action, with Michael Bay trying to make everything seem ""cool"" so retards who don't appreciate a good film won't complain. The acting was horrible, but I can't completely blame it on the actors. The script, or should I say lack thereof, gave the actors no room to be more than mere two dimensional characters. Many of the characters were insignificant to the plot anyways (the military guys and the human decepticon chick). These characters added nothing to the movie and were added either to reprise their roles and please the fanboys, or to give the audience something to look at other than big f**king robots. I was dying to leave the theater about 40 minutes in, but I was with a group and didn't want to be an ***hole. I regret that I didn't. Two and a half hours of nauseating and noisy action. Michael Bay...just give up already...please!"
"n3vermind","1","14","31","11 July 2009"," Megan Fox and shiny cars
","Don't get it twisted, I am the biggest CGI fan on the planet, I mean to the point where it becomes ridiculous. I can hardly mention how intimate I got with myself during Jurassic Park and T2 back in the days. For me CGI is incredible because when it's done right it opens up new worlds and fantasies. Look at JP, Matrix, LOTR, these are examples where it works, in this movie it doesn't.<br/><br/>We've seen the first Transformers, they can transform and it looks good and that's why I actually kinda liked the first one. I agree that the plot was thin already in the first one but the new type of cgi used made it a worthwhile movie in my book, a great theater experience.<br/><br/>So these days you have to make a trilogy if the first one is successful, it's simply one of the ways the studios make bank. In some cases the sequel gets pushed through just for the sake of making a sequel. You saw it with Matrix and Spiderman how horrible it can be, but with Transformers we have found a new low, one that I think will not be beaten for a very long time.<br/><br/>It's simple, there is no creativity, no idea, no story, no message and nothing new at all. This is a 2 hours action ride that ultimately have you hoping for the doors to be kicked in to have the theater taken over by terrorists or something else to break the sleep hypnotic piece of crap you are watching (ouch, I went full out hate, ow well lets keep going).<br/><br/>Let's just assault the premise of the movie a bit.<br/><br/>Megatron was killed in the first one. You might think they would disassemble him, melt him down, send him to the sun or something to make sure this was it. Naaah, the American government and those in charge of security had a brain aneurysm here. Instead they thought ""hmm what are we going to do with this dangerous creation now that it's dead?"". The answer was of course to drop it in the ocean and keep like 10 cruisers and submarines around JUST IN CASE he should wake up again or someone might come to pick him up. This is early in the movie that this moronic premise is revealed.<br/><br/>So I won't reveal anymore because then it becomes spoilers but if you have a brain you HAVE to leave it at home if you want to see this movie. Seriously, do not think about ANYTHING. Look at the transforming cars and let out the occasional ""wow"" and you might actually make it out. My IQ dropped about 50 points from watching this movie which explains why I can't spell English words anymore I suspect but at least I made it out, I doubt everybody will be so lucky.<br/><br/>Trust me, the last 45 minutes you will be begging for the movie to end and you wished you would have never have to listen to 30 minutes of actors trying to justify the most ridiculous plot in movie history.<br/><br/>But Hey, Megan Fox's titties bounces around a lot and there is a nice shameless intro shot of her on a bike. <br/><br/>The people HAVE spoken, this is a commercial success but I dare ANYONE to try and watch this movie twice, it simply can't be done unless you are completely retarded."

Because that happens to be the average score on IMDb. <br/><br/>Seriously what the hell is wrong with the world if they allow 200 million to be spent on crap like that. <br/><br/>Some of the action scenes were good, but the majority were over the top and hard to follow, thanks to the spastic directions of Michael Bay. I couldn't understand why they couldn't create a descent script, where continuity applied and the usual idea of character development is present. The plot was so undercooked and generic.<br/><br/>Although this was the second in the series, the transformers actually looked more fake in this film. The jokes weren't funny. Megan Fox was hotter in the first. Shia Labeouf acted like .... well.. like a vibrator (putting it bluntly). Anthony Anderson was nowhere to be found. The ""Primes"" were depicted as gods. And the worst of all, it was 2 and a half hours long. It was crap and it went forever.<br/><br/>I'm not just a hater, I actually liked the first film.

There's no story lines if you are trying to dig one, just some blah blah blah, flashbacks flashbacks flashbacks, kaboom kaboom kaboom & the audience claps their hands at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>The twins character got more airtime than Bumblebee & others?

You can do better than that! The human doing all the works? What a lame scene! Megan Fox. I know she's hot than Jessica Alba but her acting is worst than Jessica Alba. She's not into the movie. No emotion, i don't know what happened to her but she's not into the acting. Her acting is worst than worst. Come on Megan, you can do it in the first movie, how come this time, you cannot?<br/><br/>I know it's the Box Office movie because of the first movie.

","I fear I have no words to describe how much of a mess this movie was. I fear I can't even closely tell you how much you should not watch it. When I left the theater I couldn't remember anything that just happened. I think Shia LaBoeuf was involved in the picture, but I really couldn't tell for sure. I felt my brain had just been shredded by a nuclear strike of CGI, not able to find a way out of this plot less, brainless piece of crap. The total absence of any sort of dramaturgy is the only thing I might me able to tell you about, but then again I might not, because it is too irrational for the human mind to comprehend how simultaneously everything and nothing happens. Inspite of all that, I could feel an aftertaste of what has been messing up my brain for the month that this movie lasted: I now HATE Michael Bay and all he has done to modern cinema. Wow! Somewhere in the midst of the fight I've even forgotten that I liked the first part."

I'll make it short because I have already wasted a couple of hours for this piece of s**t. If you like the first movie (I loved it!) you should really not watch the second one. It's a mishmash of Gremlins, 90210 and The Brave Little Toaster. I might even go to some sort of hypnotherapy to delete any memories of it. The movie trailer was actually very good and I had high hopes as it seemed to be darker and slightly more mature sequel. But don't get fooled by - the movie itself is an utter disaster.

"evilresident097","4","18","42","13 July 2009"," More of the same old Michael Bay- All effects, no fun.
","I really enjoyed the 2007 film Transformers and was disappointed it didn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects. When I heard of the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, I was ready for an even better sequel. I heard it wasn't all that good via RottenTomatoes(19% rating currently), but I brushed that off. I even bought an IMAX ticket(this was my first non-zoo IMAX visit). What I got was 2 and a half hours of time lost and $13.50 as well. The critics were, right: this was one BIG disappointment.<br/><br/>It follows Sam(Shia LaBeouf), who is now in a big relationship with Mikaela(Megan Fox), going to college while the Autobots, including good old' Optimus Prime(voice of Peter Cullen), have sided with human soldiers to take down all of the Decepticons on Earth. After touching a piece of the AllSpark, Sam's mind is filled with symbols and this information causes Sam to become a target of the Decepticons. Apparently the Fallen, a prime who really hates Earth. It's a basically another clash between good bots and bad bots. Oh yeah, and Megatron(voice of Hugo Weaving) has been revived and he's looking for a little revenge.<br/><br/>For the positives. The film has great effects. It also has plenty more bots than the first film. And pretty much you have almost all of the major original characters(John Turturro, Tyrese Gibson, Josh Duhammel and even Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents) from the first film, except for Jon Voight(good move on his part).<br/><br/>On the negatives, it's mostly same old Bay, with a weak plot and lackluster performances. One of the film's new humans, Sam's college roommate and later companion Leo Spitz(Ramon Rodriguez), is utterly annoying. And that's just an example. Unfortunately, I didn't care much for the effects after the first 20 minutes, as the excessive running time really annoyed me(I checked my watch like 20 times). The film has plenty of moments that didn't need to be put in, and I even think some of the fight sequences were unnecessary. If I had my way, I'd shave out the useless bits, which would reduce the running time to 100-105 minutes. And what's with you, Michael? It's like he said, ""Okay, we need to focus mostly on our effects. Forget acting and story, get those effects guys on the hook now!!!!!!"" I thought the first film was his chance for a great comeback, but this just destroyed it. In fact, aside from Transformers, Bay hasn't done a decently good film since 1998's Armageddon. If they do a Transformers 3, hopefully they'll look on this film as what they should NOT do.<br/><br/>Overall, I give Revenge of the Fallen a 4 out of 10. What a shame. And it's still going to make oodles of cash($672 million worldwide and counting)."

I won't bother regurgitating the plot (what little of it there is) I'll just focus on the shortcomings if I can keep them below the 1,000 word minimum. Two scenes hit me over the head with their sheer stupidity, the first being the Air and Space Museum scene. Sam and company enter the building in Virginia, then walk through a hangar door to be magically transported into the desert amidst mountain ranges! Perhaps the films makers felt the intended audience were so out of touch with reality that they would have no grasp of basic geography. They must also know nothing about the laws of motion. One scene shows people standing in the bay of a troop transport jet, the jet then makes an abrupt turn, its wings being perpendicular to the ground, then the next shot shows them still standing as if nothing had happened instead of being plastered against the wall! Couple this with painful dialogue, over the top acting (this is a Michael Bay film, after all), and seemingly endless scenes of robots tearing each other to shreds and you have something that isn't even good enough to be considered a ""popcorn flick"" or a guilty pleasure.

"offaroundthebend","1","12","26","25 June 2009"," Please stop making these films, Bay...
","I just got home from having watched Revenge Of The Fallen, and my initial impressions are that this is the worst film I've ever seen in the cinema. The first film was pretty boring, but at least it had some soul to it and the action was fun.<br/><br/>This film has absolutely no soul. All of the new transformers are generic look-a-likes with no personality. Prime is literally the ONLY likable robot in this movie. I could go on and on about how stupid it is to give transformer hip-hop lingo and English accents but it's not worth the energy.<br/><br/>I looked the film up just now and immediately discovered the reason why the film feels so badly structured, why there is no tension in the movie, why you JUST DON'T CARE what happens at ANY point in this film: the outline for this movie was knocked out in 2 weeks because of the writer's strike. The writers bashed out a rough storyline in a hurry, then Michael Bay himself wrote a 60 page 'scriptment' outlining the action scenes, jokes (which are nearly all puerile toilet humour, or adolescent stoner jokes) and new transformer designs. Michael Bay has no business as a writer and this film is the proof. The screenwriters were then given 4 weeks to turn Bay's 'scriptment' into a full script. 4 weeks!! Most decent films take at least a year to write! Oh, and then they were paid $8 million for their troubles. Jeez.<br/><br/>The film is 2 and a half hours long but could have easily been 45 minutes shorter. The dialogue is horrible all of the time and there is no character development throughout the whole thing. Both Le Bouef's and Fox's characters are exactly the same at the end of the movie as they are at the start, and the Transformers by their very definition don't have personalities to develop. Character development is the essence of EVERY FILM! Doesn't Bay know that?? No wonder this film is such a noxious turd. We're supposed to care that the world is in jeopardy, but at no point does the threat seem real because everyone is 2-dimensional. Even when Optimus 'dies' we don't care. <br/><br/>The only time I ever got involved in the on-screen action was the fight sequence in the woods. Optimus kicks a lot of robot ass and it was a taste of how this film could have been had someone just had the sense to throw the script away and write a better one. Oh, and to get a better director. Even the explosions got old waaaay before the end because action is meaningless unless it puts something or someone in danger, and makes you feel that danger acutely. You get the feeling that stuff blows up in the film because it can. It changes nothing. It serves no purpose. It is dull.<br/><br/>3 things to note about this movie:<br/><br/>1. Don't even try to follow the plot. It's a waste of energy. As soon as people start teleporting to Egypt, give up. It's a mess from here on.<br/><br/>2. The twins are the most obnoxious attempt to appeal to a black audience I've ever seen. They are also cinema's most irritating on-screen creation since Jar Jar Binks.<br/><br/>3. If you watch it, see how many other films this one pays 'homage' to (read: blatantly rips off). I counted 12 movies, the most glaring of which are Armageddon (asteroids falling on Paris), the Terminator franchise (robot woman clinging onto a moving car) and the Matrix (every single slow motion 360 pan, and the fact that all the new Transformers just look like squiddies). See also Indiana Jones, Star Wars, LOTR and many more. Originality is truly dead here.<br/><br/>To summarise, you know something is wrong when you are actually rooting for the main characters to die at the end just so the freaking film will end. I watched this film with 12 people and every single person declared this among the worst films they've ever seen. Watch at your own peril."
"Jeremiah1971","2","25","63","24 June 2009"," Flash with Little Substance (Warning Major Spoilers ahead)
","This movie lacked a clear narrative structure, and was logically inconsistent. The plot point centers around the Fallen getting revenge and firing his weapon. Optimus Prime was a main obstacle to this, but the Deceptagon attack on Optimus was incidental. Then the plot switches to reviving Optimus, and his part in the climax could have easily been a one shot in the opening. In fact the same power to revive Optimus so he could thwart the destruction of Earth was also the source to put Earth in jeopardy to begin with. It would make more logical sense to destroy the matrix right off eliminating the danger. This would prevent Optimus' return, but likely he wouldn't risk the Earth just to be revived. Also Blackbird ended being more instrumental in restoring Optimus.<br/><br/>The geographic planning in the movie sucked. Cairo and the Gizz Pyramids are over 200 miles from the tip of the Gulf of Agaba, and Petra is another 100+ miles beyond that. The climax sequences made them seem much closer in relation. Also the Air/Space Museum in DC is in the city limits and does not adjoin a large airfield as alluded to in the movie. Location flaws such as this and bad internal plot logic really emphasize that this movie is flash over substance."
"ciarandino","1","13","29","23 July 2009"," This movie sucks so much i wanted to kill myself while watching it
","Well, I suppose I was expecting a little too much from this movie. And with my high expectations, I watched the movie. I should of known. Michael Bay has never ever made a movie with a good story or acting. In the first film, he was under the wing of Spielberg, and it turned out to be a blast. A couple of care free hours where giant transforming robots seem to become a part of reality. With great action scenes, some dialouge that wasn't half bad, and some hilarious moments made this one of the best films of 2007.<br/><br/>But when Dreamworks saw how much money the movie made for them, they decided, hey, let's give Michael Bay more freedom next time, cus he executed this one pretty darn well. And of course, Michael's mind consists of explosive action, err, explosive action, err, lame comedy, cr*ppy dialouge and a plot with so many subplots that you get easily confused. A subplot can go away for a while and then just suddenly pop back into the film, and your like, wait, weren't you just talking about something else. And then before you know it, there's more action again. Half an hour in and I was bored as hell. That first half hour is actually okay. The action isn't so consistent and actually pretty good, the dialouge is exceptable and there's actually a few quite funny moments. But then Optimus Prime dies and it pretty much goes downhill from there. When Optimus died, I felt myself feeling no emotions, and when Sam died, I was just like ,yeah, yeah, get on with it, and of course, the little b**tard comes back to haunt us. The climax of the film is so dull, It's just running, shouting and stuff blowing up. By god I hope they lock Michael Bay into some rocket and send him into orbit around the moon. Lock the doors and destroy the key and leave his crazy mind to go wild, instead it boring the hell out of all of us people of Earth. Bad director=bad movie. Nuff said."

"krycek19","1","13","29","30 June 2009"," Bay's worst movie since Armageddon
","I'm normally a fan of Bay's movies, except from Armageddon which I really, really hate.<br/><br/>The list of reasons why this movie suck is endless. Two and a half hours is a long time, if you don't have the story to back it up. None of the humor that worked in the first Transformers, which I love, works here. Sam's mom is incredibly annoying and Megan Fox couldn't act if her life depended on it.<br/><br/>There is no plot in this movie and yet endless plot-holes. They've already been mentioned by others, but I will mention one: Bumblebee is completely unaware that Sam has a Decepticon in human disguise in his car/Bumblebee. That particular Decepticon is a complete and way too obvious rip-off of The Terminatrix in Terminator 3. But the scene where it tries to seduce Sam is the only scene in the entire movie that is just a little creepy and actually works. The movie is in general way too childish and tries way too hard to be funny. The robots have more screen time than the actors and cgi-characters cannot replace real actors. The scene where Optimus was talking to a politician was so horrible and annoying. Speaking of that, why the hell was Obama mentioned by name?? Usually the president is fictitious, so why mention the real president? I don't think Obama is too happy to be associated with this pile of monkey-crap anyway.The scene on Cybertron was annoying and childish. And all the scenes with Agent Simmons and Leo (who looks almost exactly like Shia, why is that Bay??) should have been cut out of the movie. None of the romantic scenes work and should have been cut out as well. And Bay should be ashamed of advertising for his own previous movies in both the first Transformers and in this one.<br/><br/>Bay are of course already planning a third movie. And just like the Pirates sequels and the Matrix sequels, the third one will suck too. I hate sequels clearly made only for the money with no story, no hart, no nothing, except huge action-sequences and annoying attempts of humor that falls flat on its ass.<br/><br/>I hope Bay will some day come to his senses and make a movie again like The Rock. Still his best movie ever, with the best acting, best score and best everything.<br/><br/>Bay has proved that he is only making movies for the money. Not because he likes to tell stories or enjoys directing, which he is not very good at by the way. Bay was so busy trashing the robots in Terminator Salvation, but even though Salvation still sucks it's a far better movie that this one. <br/><br/>Witch just proves that without a descent script, you got nothing. Not the biggest explosion ever with actors on set can make up for a script, written while Bay was sitting on the can.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie at all cost!!"
"MrEnigmaOO","1","13","29","27 June 2009"," Not just a terrible film, but a social blight
","I can't be nice about this.<br/><br/>I am not a prude about movies. I'd rather watch Spider-Man 2 than anything from Fellini any day of the week. I can certainly tolerate high concept, big budget action movies. I can even appreciate the occasional need for mindless entertainment with little substance - I gladly paid for, and enjoyed, 300 even though it wasn't a quality film. It was entertaining while lacking substance. But there's a difference between a little bit of substance and none at all. And Transformers 2 isn't 300.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong with paying to see Transformers 2, since I understand that it's a tent pole film of the summer and everyone's buzzing about it and, let's face it, if you're gonna see a movie like this, it should be in the theater. But if you enjoyed Transformers 2, you should be ashamed of yourself. This is not hyperbole. Transformers 2 is not only a horrible movie, but one that's actually insulting to intelligent people and made me feel worse off having watched it than I was before. And how is a movie like this received? Why, with thunderous applause and laughter, of course.<br/><br/>If you need to have it explained to you why Transformers 2 is bad, go read any critic's review of it - it's not difficult to figure out why. But the critics don't represent the masses. Every joke in Transformers 2 is either corny, stupid, lewd for the sake of being lewd (robots yelling expletives is not a punchline), or all three. Yet the audience laughed at them. The action scenes are overly congested and, despite looking flashy, have very little going on. Yet the audience stared at them in awe. The drama is forced and canned, the characters are blank slates, Shia Lebouf is a mediocre actor at best who brings nothing to the table, there are mile-long pieces of plot exposition that should put everyone to sleep and need to be broken up, every woman is drop-dead gorgeous and talks like they came out out of a late-night phone dating ad, and yet...<br/><br/>Michael Bay will make millions and millions of dollars for this sorry excuse for entertainment and will be allowed to continue to make movies. And I'll have to hear from people for years how ""awesome"" Transformers 2 was. These are the same people who eagerly wait to hear what Dane Cook has to say. These are the people who turn on the TV and watch Family Guy for their comedy and House for their drama.<br/><br/>There were, at best, two genuine moments in the entire bloated 2 1/2 hours of this film (Optimus Prime's big scene in the middle and possibly Shia Lebouf's moment near the end). Couldn't we, if nothing else, just get 2 hours of robots punching each other? I would have been content with that. I especially feel sorry for people who were fans of Transformers prior to the movies. There's nothing that says that the franchise requires Shia Lebouf and moronic story lines - that's just something they added in. Those poor fans will never get a decent live action flick.<br/><br/>This is why the terrorists hate us, folks. Because this is what we do with our freedom. We applaud movies like Transformers 2. I spent my last 13 bucks on it and feel genuinely sick because of it. I've heard a great deal of debate as to whether or not it's okay to give the people what they want or not. This is pure proof that it's not. Because ""the people"" want explosions, cars, and no plot or substance, assuming it's covered up with hot chicks, of course. The people who also say no in response to this question usually cite Nazi Germany, in which what the people wanted was clearly wrong. It's a bit of a leap, but replace excessive violence and genocide with stupidity and you've got the same idea. Ever see Blade Runner? That's the junk culture that our society is heading toward. It's very rare that I play the ""someone think of the children"" card, but there were a lot of little kids in that theater. If this is what they're watching, not just in terms of the violence/vulgarity of it, but also in terms of the stupidity, what's the next generation gonna be like? I'm a film major and I just watched my art form get defecated on. I need to go watch Cuckoo's Nest or Raging Bull or something as a metaphorical shower. Seriously, last summer, Christopher Nolan released the Dark Knight, showing that blockbuster movies could be intelligent and rich in subtext, while still being adrenaline pumping. How could he have raised the bar so high and yet trash like Transformers 2 is still considered acceptable? I don't want to be on this planet anymore with people that enjoy Transformers 2. If there were an alternative option to Earth, I'd take it.<br/><br/>Unless I see a Decepticon there. For those who have yet to see Transformers 2, I urge you to resist and not pay to see it. I won't judge you if you do, though. I will, however, if you enjoy it. If it weren't for Mortal Kombat: Annihilation and Fantastic Four 2: Rise of the Silver Surfer, I'd say Transformers 2 is the worst movie I've ever seen. Go enjoy your millions, Michael Bay, and hope there's not a film hell awaiting you in the afterlife.<br/><br/>I saw a trailer for 2012 prior to this that suggested the world would end that year. Here's hoping there's something to that.<br/><br/>Oh, and Megan Fox is so hot, it hurts. But that's not a good reason to enjoy Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen."

Acting: slim to none, story line: poor, plot advancement/continuity : terrible, editing : worst ever, well I don't know, name it, and I'll say ""shit.""

OK, Michael Bay, hasn't anyone told you that the 'shaky camera' sucks? People see this movie to see robots fight each other, well, they can't actually see it, because the camera is filming from weird angles and it is bouncing and hopping and doing all the stuff that it shouldn't be doing all the time... I mean, the last part.. the last fight... Jesus H Christ... can it be any worse ? I mean, doesn't it have to be an epic fight ? But we actually don't get to see it... Also, the fallen has these amazing powers, warping and manipulating gravity and stuff, and then he gets beat down in a simple hand to hand brawl ? Get the 'F' out. My only hope is that they don't make the 3rd movie, and people read this review and don't see the movie. Seriously, don't see this movie, don't contribute to its earnings, don't encourage people who make these kinds of movies.

","What the hell is going on here? Rhetorical question aside, we can seriously see for ourselves that this second movie of the Transformers franchise is an abysmal rash on the arse end of a toilet bacteria doing the rounds in the U-bend of life. While losing its way in the wasting sewers of time that is the completely unnecessary and over-the-top eye-candy that populates this self-pleasing world of Kruger, Orci and Kurtzman, who, at the same time does more than insult the intelligence of their audience. Suggesting, for example, that by the time of reaching middle age, Judy Witwicky does not have the slightest clue as to what she has in her possession when taking young Sam to University. If this was placed into the final draft to execute giggles from its audience then it just could not have been a more stone cold sobering moment if it had not tried any harder. A pure ridiculous and unneeded moment.<br/><br/>The foresight of imagination in the auditorium is made more limited by the smoke and mirrors that are here to distract the basic observations of realities from the fanciful, comic puerile tendencies that is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.<br/><br/>With a slant on a propaganda front, the coupling of the Untied States and her ally Great Britain, it seems more than a smattering of topical eventualities' than two nations gunning for one common mechanical purpose. This, and the nauseating sequence of ""families of war"" and the more than coincidence of Mr. and Mrs. Witwicky being placed in the heart of the battle to project the unity of support and concern is slightly worrying. In that this movie seems that it has to pull itself in this direction of topical heartstrings that is, in the end result, more propaganda than entertainment.<br/><br/>Still, the world of intergalactic terrorism is prominent within this celluloid farce as is, too, the MTV news channels that regurgitate the similar dross with still endless results. The seamless narcissistic, ego boosting war machine we see here is ludicrous: blast 'em with all ya got! And just how ""did"" those U.S. tanks end up in the Egyptian desert? Think beyond the margin and it will transcend you into the wider appreciation of just how shallow and egocentric this second instalment is.<br/><br/>Apart from the shoddy continuity edit's, childish humour, DVD selling eye-candy and overall poor execution of plot, the cowardice of the use of foul language, if you are going to say IT then say IT; fear of losing its 12a (UK) certificate would seem more worrying than the fear of losing the third instalment war of cinema seats it seems.<br/><br/>Sadly, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has fallen, fallen into the arms that are Armitage Shanks, leaving you more than a little flushed, it will leave you empty, relieved and thanking god that that is all over."
"wandererwillow","3","13","29","24 June 2009"," Great graphics, but everything else falls far short
","I should know better than to expect different from Michael Bay, but I decided to give this movie a shot. First off, clocking in at over 2 hours of playtime, the movie is considerably long. However, in the entire movie, they manage to shove in as many overdone scenes as they could manage to fit in, and the whole movie is apparently intended to be nothing but continual action. The story had major events happen extremely quick and were clouded out by ""everything else"" that they had in it (i.e. explosions, massive fight scenes with unnamed and forgettable characters, so on).<br/><br/>First and foremost, I want to know the audience they were shooting for. Many of their humorous moments were extremely overdone and were questionable for why they would be put into the movie. Two dogs start humping out of nowhere...twice. The massive Decepticon is for some reason given a pair of metal ""testicals"" (wrecking balls from a construction vehicle). The mother getting high on pot brownies and proceeding to make an ass of herself for no reason. The jokes were extremely childish and way out of place, but at the same time were definitely unnecessary for any child to see. In fact, about 90% of the movies humor is through blatant sexuality, and again...most times for no good reason.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the many overused, overdone scenes that just make you cringe keep popping up. The ""say you love me"" ""I don't want to yet"" stuff got old right off the bat. The mother being extremely clingy. My favorite has to be something I have seen so many times and it continues to make me face-palm...the ""You have to let me go, dad!"" scenes, where the kid has to save the world or whatever, and the dad doesn't want to let him, so he screams ""you have to let me go!"" until the dad breaks down and gives in. It's no longer moving or meaningful after excessive use. War of the Worlds did the same thing and it was just as bad.<br/><br/>The plot was extremely basic but took so long to happen, and was even harder to enjoy with the gratuitous amounts of overdone and at times unnecessary action sequences. 2 minutes of plot advancement, then 20-30 minutes of fight and action scenes, rinse and repeat. Many unknowns are killed off rather easily, even the massive one near the end (not spoiling, you'll see if you haven't). At the end, you feel like the story wasn't that important, and while it could have been much better, it falls far short.<br/><br/>The only saving grace has to be the graphics...this definitely had to be a difficult film for the animators due to the massive amount of CGI needing to be done. Still, many scenes are so quick moving that you can't really marvel at the detail put into the characters. Most of it looks messy and disorganized at times. It was large amounts of work, which looks impressive at a distance, but looking closer you pick up on how it feels like no deep detail was done on the bots, and a lot of things feel thrown together.<br/><br/>So, all in all, surprised as hell this movie stands at a 7.5 right now, I expect that to go down significantly, but I agree with a line from a great song...""Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?"" Very disappointed, and so were many of the people that went to see the movie with me."

Unfortunately, it had quite the opposite effect.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of Transformers in the 80s and 90s. I liked the first movie, though I don't find LeBoeuf particularly watchable. I like some Bay movies (Bad Boys, The Rock, Armegeddon) and hated others (Pearl Harbor and Bad Boys II).<br/><br/>This film was long. Way too long. It's almost 2 1/2 hours that could have easily, easily, been 45-60 minutes shorter. There are so many slow-motion shots of people diving away from explosions, or screaming aloud, or just doing nothing interesting that they could have saved 20 minutes just by taking those out.<br/><br/>Most of the characters are ridiculous, especially LeBoeuf's Sam. He has to be one of the most unlikable main characters to appear in any blockbuster in living memory. The rest of the characters are all stupid, and wait around to have things explained to them that the audience have already guessed.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are almost genius. If you're wondering what 2 giant robots slugging it out looks like, you will get your answers here. The 'choreography' of the fights is much better than the first movie. However, and I'm sure it's been noted before me, it's hard to work out who is fight who amid the noise and blur of steel on steel. In the final battle especially, you can't work out who is an Autobot and who is a Decepticon.<br/><br/>The romance sub-plot is pretty poor, Sam's roommate is another annoying character. John Turturro almost saves the day until he spews out some pretty bad lines.<br/><br/>If you're going to see this in the same frame of mind that you watched Charlies Angels in, then you might enjoy it.

Its like an acid-trip with two Mexican strippers and a bag of bubblegum, just ridiculous. <br/><br/>Really makes you wonder who is responsible to give a retarded man this much money to throw in the ocean (make this movie).<br/><br/>The scenes that I believe was supposed to be romantic was so sadly produced and acted that you rather than feeling for the characters actually felt for the actors and their careers. <br/><br/>A few times during this two and a half hour endurance test you actually found yourself thinking that the director must be joking, but sadly he didn't.."

It was filled with funny moments! -""Doesn't stick to story"" Yes it does, I understood the story the whole time. -""Shows the CGI effects way too much"" A lot is much better than a little.

","This movie was horrible. It was a waste of money, & I suggest people not to go see it. I thought it was very pointless. The first one was very good, but this one was horrible. There was a lot of crude humor, sexuality, and i was appalled by everything they did to destroy this movie. At first, it seemed kinda cool. The opening and everything. But barely into the movie, you see some stupid dogs humping each other, twice in like 5 minutes..which is pointless anyways, and has nothing to do with the whole Transformers thing, and then we see girls in college, and they show all of the ""beautiful"" ones with cleavage and nice bodies, just like the media wants you to believe. It's eye candy for many guys, and probably made many girls, including me, feel horrible, and makes us feel worse about ourselves, because of how ""perfect"" the girls seem, especially Megan Fox, and how much we would like to look like her. The movie shows off her body, closes up on her lips, and there are scenes of a ""beautiful"" girl trying everything to seduce Sam, she suggestively pushes a chair into something and sits on his lap, and then you see her later, get on top of Sam, until you see a tail come out, showing her underwear. Obviously, I could tell from the beginning that something was wrong with her. Anyways, getting off subject... another thing that bothered me and my boyfriend, is how the Autobots would bleed blood, and they would be torn apart as if they had guts. Omg, robots are not supposed to bleed! I mean, cmon. And so many things were just thrown in there unnecesarily. I mean, if guys like this movie because of the sexy girls, the party scenes, the crude humor, and the sensuality, you guys can go buy some porn or something instead. But don't waste your money on this. This is supposed to be about robots, not skanky, suggestive girls, and stupid explosions, and no plot."

","I liked the first film a little, silly stuff that sort of worked.<br/><br/>This mess on the other hand is one of the most unwatchable films I have ever seen. First of all Megan Fox can not act, she is self conscious, boring and doesn't seem to even care. The fact that they keep panning all over her body is just sad if that's what they need to sell this garbage. The idea that Fox is dating LaBeouf is simply silly, especially the way she acts like a tramp hanging over the bike pretending to airbrush. In the real world she would be hit on 24/7 and never stay with this loser.<br/><br/>What college doesn't allow freshman to have cars? College is optional and your paying to go there, they can't tell you if you can drive or not and how would they know? Your new roommate has a business/creepy stalking set up in your room and you are not allowed to change roommates?? They sell your mother pot on campus?? Is this fashion model school with no normal people? When did Princeton become a party school?<br/><br/>Why would a robot cry? Why do robots from another planet have black accents and why are they ever a car during combat, aren't they faster as themselves??? The entire story about the stupid thing they need to get is distracting, implausible and moronic and there is so much action you are desensitized by it after a while.<br/><br/>The amount of ad placement in this is nauseating. State Farm, Audi, Chevy, Cisco, etc.<br/><br/>I couldn't even get all the way through this nonsense, not recommended unless you are 9 years old or an adult with a death wish.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is simply the worst director in the world."

","It's pretty simple really Transformers 2 is one of the sloppiest pieces of garbage ever made. This film holds a proud place next to ""The Wild Wild West"" and ""Van Helsing"". The reality is that Michael Bay does not care about Transformers fans or ANY fans for that matter. Bay never took nor wanted to take the Transformers property seriously. It was Steven Spielberg who had kept Bay on a tight leash for the first Transformers and that's why the original movie is a decent film.<br/><br/>TF: Revenge of the Fallen is a relentless mess of childish comic relief, horrible characters, and the worst writing in Hollywood history. And did I mention the jokes? Oh yes the jokes!! Sex jokes, pot jokes, fart jokes, penis jokes, ghetto robots, more fart jokes, and John Turturro..Nuff said. I swear this movie is so bad; it's almost as if Michael Bay was trying to purposely mock his own audience. Bay never liked Transformers, so now he has spent 2 ½ hours making the audience suffer for liking a franchise that he considers stupid and juvenile. It's amazing really Sure, Transformers is based on a children's toy line, but it didn't have to be like this. We could have had a quality adaptation that was on par with Star Wars or Harry Potter. But instead we get a big pile of garbage from a man who is such an ignorant film maker and some of the worst writers in history. .<br/><br/>Shame on Michael Bay and his terrible team of Hollywood hacks"

The climax is a little overplayed with typical romance creeping in.<br/><br/>The end leaves path for another sequel. It's not like dooms day and has left of loose ends to build upon.<br/><br/>The characters have been played well. Romance might not have been entirely necessary in the movie but it does not hurt.

"TOMNEL","2","11","24","10 July 2009"," Almost like a spoof of Transformers, and a horribly unfunny one at that.
","Wow! This Transformers movie...what can you say about it? It's so unbelievably bad, with the only positives being the occasional interesting fight scene, but even those only lift this movie up to it's still horrible level. The constant jokes and strange plot points and nonstop mistakes and cheesy love scenes make this movie very, very hard to sit through.<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeuf), our hero from the first flick is now going to college. His wacky parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White) are driving him, as Sam's not bringing Bumblebee, the lovable nonspeaking Transformer car. Also on Sam's list of leave behinds is his skin tight short short pantie wearing girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox). Meanwhile, the Decepticons are coming back to Earth to go after an ancient device that could end all life on Earth. Not only that, but Sam has wacky mishaps in college, and Optimus Prime is killed, and the government takes control of his body. And then...everyone transports to Egypt for the conclusion. Oh the humanity!<br/><br/>Where to start with the negatives? How about the robots. These are the most obnoxious robots ever! They linger on stereotypes and play the sole role of being comic relief, but instead add absolutely nothing. Mudflap and Skids (Skids is voiced by Tommy ""Spongebob"" Kenny) are the most horrible creatures to hit the big screen. Their entire role is bantering back and forth, and making bad jokes. They're like Jar Jar Binks times 100 in terms of annoying CGI sidekicks. Then we've got Wheelie, who is also voiced by Tom Kenny. Before continuing about the character, I'd like to comment on Tom Kenny. He is only good at doing cartoony voices, like the Mayor on Powerpuff Girls, Heffer on Rocko's Modern Life, and his most known character Spongebob. Him trying to voice an actual character is pathetic. Both his characters sound like Spongebob. This guy can't change his voice enough to make unique characters. Anyways, Wheelie is also annoying. He's a foul mouth, but due to our PG-13 limit, he uses the word ""frickin'"" like crazy. Very annoying!!!!<br/><br/>Time to talk about bizarre elements of the movie. The Fallen had a...hehe...scrotum. Bahaha! Man, that's some real clever stuff. Sam goes to robot heaven...well that makes sense! Sam has a bandage magically appear on his hand to cover up Shia Labeuf's real life motorcycle accident. It's fine to cover it up, but when it's unexplained, it seems more like a continuity problem. A little robot has fun with Megan Fox's leg. These script writers must've been pulling all nighters for these hilarious ideas. Speaking of hilarious, Sam's mom eats a weed brownie and starts tackling people. Is this Transformers or Disaster Movie? A female human...turns out to be a Transformer. Hmmmm, these guys really can fool us humans. Somehow, the Decepticons not only made one of their own to look and sound exactly like a human, but apparently they got her into college...all just to kill Sam? Those sneaky bots. Bravo, you magnificent writers, bravo! This is a poorly acted, horribly written and dismally directed mess of a film, and yet it's a hit financially. Don't go to see this! All that will result is a headache, and possibly a story to tell your friends about how bad this film truly is.<br/><br/>My rating: 1/2 out of ****. 150 mins. PG-13 for drug, crude, sex humor, violence and language"
"stietjen-1","1","11","24","8 July 2009"," hated it
","I was shocked at the numbers of parents with young children at this movie. Those kids didn't belong there, but it wasn't the parents' fault. They expected a fun family flick with lots of transformer pizazz in it. They got more than they bargained for--and less.<br/><br/>Hollywood was on a role with this movie with terrible language, completely unnecessary sexual innuendos, cheesy performances, a terrible (totally trite and worn out) plot, and a poor excuse for great special effects. Some parts were actually boring. My hubbie, who loves Transformers, actually fell asleep for a couple of minutes part way through. The only good parts were the leading lady's eyes, BumbleBee, and the main character's mother. She was actually funny.<br/><br/>Beyond that, I wouldn't torture my worst enemy with it--and I wouldn't ever encourage my grown children to take my grandchildren to see it. Who ever heard of a robot with balls? For crying out loud. And haven't we seen the story line before? Bad aliens are going to blow up something (in this case our sun) with a special machine hidden in one of the Egyptian pyramids, the good aliens are going to help man fight them, and our main characters have the key. Woopie do. I'm snoring. The middle age kids will probably love the wham-bam stuff and the great transformations of the Transformers, but they shouldn't be inundated with any more foul language than they already hear. And what's with the robot humping the girl? It was bad enough when the dog did it to the other dog. Hollywood, grow up."
"michaelblum","1","11","24","7 July 2009"," Transformers 2 may have made me a misanthrope.
","This is my second movie review... I was so upset about this movie that I felt compelled to take a few minutes out of my day to rate it here in the hopes that I can save someone else from wasting their time and money and encouraging studios to make more terrible, worthless movies like this.<br/><br/>There is a cool 10 seconds or so of actually cool robot combat that takes place in a wooded area. Some of the dialog is funny. The vast majority of the movie left me feeling slightly nauseas, mildly depressed and a little angry. All Michael Bay had to do was make a movie at least as good as the first one - with more cool fighting scenes like the one in the woods between Prime and the Decepticons. Instead, he gives us over an hour of pointless filler, stock military footage and unbelievably stupid add-ins like... dogs screwing - three times, a robot humping Megan Fox's leg, an old robot with a bad back cane and a beard, a robot crying, a robot with huge metal testicles, a wise-cracking Joe Pesci robot who inexplicably has no weapons like all the other robots - yet is sent on a critical mission by the Decepticons only to be captured by Megan Fox and held captive in a small box, two Jar-Jar Binks-like functionally retarded robots appear out of nowhere and inexplicably are sent on a critical mission by the autobots to save the human race and autobots. That's just naming a few of the unbelievably ridiculous nonsense that this movie presents to the viewer. And these things are presented with no coherent plot whatsoever. The plot that is there is full of gaping holes that only the dumbest of viewers could overlook. Random things happen constantly that completely violate any rules set up previously. At one point, a robot teleports himself and a group of humans half way around the world while at no point previous in the movie or in the first Transformers movie were Autobots or Decepticons able to teleport.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting the Godfather or anything but this movie just made me shake my head as it seemed to be deliberately made to be terrible. I felt like the director hates his audience and just put a bunch of deliberately nonsensical crap up on the screen and spent 100 million to render goofy CGI robots wrestling and cussing at each other, intercut with pointless stock footage of aircraft carriers and helicopters just to say ""you idiots will pay to see this crap no matter how insanely awful it is"".<br/><br/>I was left even more depressed by the fact that teenagers in the audience applauded the movie at the end. And reading some of the positive reviews here, I genuinely feel sad about the state of America's education system. How anyone can find this movie entertaining is beyond me."
"Critomaton","1","11","24","5 July 2009"," Exceeds the limits of human imagination...
","...in a very bad way. It would have been nice to see a movie about robots that transform into vehicles, and how they interact with the inhabitants of planet Earth. Instead, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is about how much contempt a major motion picture studio can have for the audience and still set box office records.<br/><br/>Remember all those IBM commercials from several years back that showed what computers would do for us in the future? You know, like being able to make stock trades from the heads-up display in your sunglasses while disturbing pigeons in an Italian square, or stuffing meat in your pants at the grocery store and having it automatically scanned by RFID on your way out? Well, what they didn't tell you was that massive amounts of computing power would one day be used to put every conceivable shape, color, and texture on the big screen in rapid motion all at once in a mind-numbing display of sensory overload.<br/><br/>Like the first Transformers movie, the robots do very little as vehicles except drive from place to place, so there are many wasted opportunities for creative destruction or battles. And the robots' exteriors are so insanely complicated that they barely seem humanoid - it is next to impossible to discern a face, let alone the facial expressions necessary to inspire any sort of empathy.<br/><br/>A child playing with a couple of Transformers from Hasbro would likely be more creative than the director of this movie, because a child would explore the possibilities within the limitations of the toys' capabilities. Apparently, with Michael Bay's practically unlimited budget, there is no boundary reference within which he can gauge the entertainment value of any conceivable scene, no matter how insipid. <br/><br/>I'm not sure which is worse: the ethnic caricatures so ham-handedly embedded in so many of the robots or the creepy overuse of the ""robotic tentacles can come from anywhere, go anywhere, and do anything"" conceit.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I know what's worse: the ""introduce a new character to take the rapid-fire Gilmore Girls-style dialogue up another notch on the annoying meter"" trick. Early in the movie, it was frustratingly difficult to understand much of what was being said, as it was constantly being covered up by robotic footsteps or hydraulic sounds. Then I realized that was a good thing.<br/><br/>I propose a new category of cinematic recognition called ""The Academy Dewards"", in which past accolades are systematically and publicly rescinded from anyone associated in a material way with films as bad as ""Transformers 2"". For example, anywhere Steven Spielberg is making an appearance to be commended or honored for directing ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", someone should run out to the podium, forcibly remove the award from his hands, and remind everyone that he is the ""S"" in Dreamworks SKG, which released ""T:RotF"".<br/><br/>I've been wrong before (many times in fact), but I think that this movie is so bad it will generate enough ill will to sidetrack the careers of everyone in it (except for John Turturro - his role as Phantom in ""You Don't Mess with the Zohan"" makes him an untouchable Hollywood legend). I already removed Shia LaBeouf from my ""show this guy some respect by learning how to pronounce his name"" list.<br/><br/>The irony is that, for all the apparent effort that went into this film, there is a startling lack of imagination in all of the action sequences. It would have been much more impressive if Michael Bay had conformed the robots' general behavior, size, and shape to to the attributes of their vehicle alter egos, and had them interact with each other and humans as vehicles more. Instead, he threw in everything and the kitchen sink, in both the effects and the dialogue, and the result is a huge mess.<br/><br/>Finally, I know this movie doesn't really take itself seriously, even though it clearly took a lot of money and computing power to produce. But still, there is a limit to the strain on credulity: asking me to believe that it is difficult to say ""I love you"" to Megan Fox is just too much.<br/><br/>I hope I won't have to revise this statement for a while, and it is the first time I've made it in many reviews: ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is the worst film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>P.S. Did I mention there's an SR-71 Blackbird that talks and acts like a Pirate of the Caribbean?"

"MovieAddict2016","3","11","24","1 July 2009"," Huge step down from the first film
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a blockbuster of the most egregious variety. As a stand-alone film, it's noisy, vapid and bloated. As a sequel to the first film — which was, as you might recall, a surprisingly entertaining popcorn flick — it's disappointing and borderline offensive. It's the sort of sequel that was all too common in the 1980s — a continuation of a story without a story; about as necessary as Weekend at Bernie's II or whatever other marginally tolerable cash-in you can think of. The movie was clearly built from its predecessor's success, with little consideration given to the dynamics of what's actually occurring on-screen. For some people, this may seem a minor complaint — after all, as its stars willingly admitted in junket interviews, people don't go to see films about giant fighting robots for the story lines — but at nearly two-and-a-half hours, you're likely to find your patience put to its test, especially when you can't even wrap your head around what's happening half the time.<br/><br/>The actors are all given thankless tasks to perform. Shia LaBeouf is one of the most likable and convincing actors of his kind — perhaps not the sort of deeply committed artist you'd rank as a great actor, but amiable and charming enough to carry blockbusters. His performance in the first Transformers helped add human conflict to an otherwise robotic (pun intended) string of action sequences. Here, he's given quite little to do. Why's he even in the story at all? It's never fully explained, beyond the obvious (um, he has to be, because you don't fix what ain't broke, right?). The plot: He finds a piece of shrapnel left behind from the first film and has a bunch of alien data magically ingrained into his brain on the day he leaves for Princeton University; suddenly the Decepticons are after him, to extract the information that will apparently lead them to the location (in an Egyptian desert) of a device that can, like, blow up the sun or something.<br/><br/>None of it really makes sense. Most of the characters from the first film return (bar Jon Voight), and the roles seem pointless. Megan Fox, god bless her, tries to do more than just pout for the camera, but she appears and disappears at the will of the screenplay, which disregards her altogether for half the movie. She is, of course, a bad actress; but she openly acknowledges this, which makes me respect her far more than I otherwise would. I want to see her do well based solely on the fact that she's not the typical politically correct, wholesome Hollywood starlet. Brutally honest, self-deprecating beauties don't come around very often. To witness her fighting against the underdeveloped typecasting of her character is a struggle. To watch her openly describe Michael Bay as a ""tyrant"" to his face during a press conference is delightful; I'd more gladly pay for 2 1/2 hours of that.<br/><br/>Most action films have one form of comedic relief; Transformers 2 has four. John Turturro returns to his role as an obsessive and wacky CIA agent (he provides the most laughs, which are hardly plentiful), but there's also three regrettable new sidekicks: a pair of unintentionally racist gangsta Transformers (perhaps the most offensive animated ethnic stereotypes since Jar-Jar Binks), and a perpetually whiny college kid played by newcomer Ramon Rodriguez, who has promised us that his role in Transformers 3 will be greatly expanded. No, thanks.<br/><br/>Then, at least, there's director Michael Bay. What on earth inspired him to create such a laborious, boring film? Perhaps the same level of vanity that propelled him to feature close-ups of a poster for Bad Boys II here? Another filmmaker — Steven Spielberg, for example — might be able to get away with this sort of apparent self-love on the belief that he's being tongue-in-cheek. We never quite get that feeling with Bay. When he shows us the Bad Boys poster, it's self-idolatry — not self-deprecation or even just self-reference. And it's that ego of his, I'd imagine, that caused him to make his worst film since Pearl Harbor — and that one's really only worse because of its blatant disregard for the historical aspects. If Transformers: RotF were based on a true series of events, I'd be inclined to say this is even worse, because it felt even longer than Pearl Harbor, which is no easy feat.<br/><br/>The saddest part about this whole mess is that you realize countless hours were invested in its technical craft. The special effects are superb; animators gave healthy portions of their lives to making this thing look good, and then when you see it up on screen, it's all so barely decipherable; between the shaky camera, split-second cuts and constant panning, the intertwining robots are virtually impossible to get a handle on. Who's beating whom? I couldn't even tell half the time. The last 45 minutes of the movie are so painful, dull and monotonous that I just kept checking my wristwatch in anguish, trying to calculate when the film had actually started and how long the previews had lasted. I saw The Dark Knight a year ago — a film of comparable length — and don't recall glancing away from the screen a single time, much less to check the time. The era of superior action thrillers has only rendered Michael Bay's inadequacies all the more obvious; it's clearer now than ever before that this guy really doesn't have a clue what he's doing. There are elements of his style that I admire, and certainly no one can claim he isn't distinct — the problem is that he's currently distinctly awful, and cutting his running times down by about an hour and learning how to handle his actors (I haven't yet mentioned his complete misuse of Rainn Wilson) might be a step in the right direction."

For those who are thinking at the first movie, get over it man, you are not re-watching it.

","This is the first time I'm writing a comment on IMDb. I really don't know where to begin. I never wanted a movie to end so badly. This movie was a torture right from the beginning.<br/><br/>Everybody's acting was amazingly awful. The story was hard to follow and there was a potpourri of action going on. It was hard to find out which robots were on the good side. Later I figured out that the robots firing at Sam were the bad ones although I thought all of them were firing at him for his bad acting.<br/><br/>Shia's job in the movie was to scream like a little girl which he did really well. Megan's job was to look beautiful and not act which she also did really well and rest of the cast followed the two leads...really well.<br/><br/>There were some out of the blue moments in the movie where they tried to show some drama and some comedy (which was also cheap comedy...dogs and robots humping!) which did not fit well at all plus the cheap double meaning jokes by the bawdy physics professor. College life can not be misrepresented as badly as this movie does. and you'll never know what the hell was Ramon Rodriguez's role in the movie. But he did a good job at being funny at 2 or 3 occasions especially with the taser.<br/><br/>In this movie you'll see everything even a ""Robot Heaven"" where Sam goes after he dies for a while and meets the other heavenly robots who give him the wisdom of his life...The movie will also take you back to 17000B.C. even further into history than 10000B.C. (another awful movie) and will show you how humans and robots looked at that time...you'll see how American army can go anywhere in the world and bomb any desert they want (this time it was Jordan, Egypt) and just when I thought I had seen everything they came up with a pyramid that could destroy the Sun ...<br/><br/>The action sequences were painful...shaky camera...metallic objects flying here and there...hard to figure out which robot was good or bad...bad background score...dialogues going on in between action scenes that don't make sense...Shia and Megan outrunning monstrous robots...etc etc etc...<br/><br/>Take a blender and mix Transformer 1 + soft porn + 10000BC + American pie + national treasure + throw in some bad music cd's that you were going to throw in trash and tada you get Transformer 2 the revenge of the fallen"

","I'm gone keep this short because there is a lot detailed reviews why this is a terrible movie. First there's a lot wrong geographically (Egypt- Jordan mix-up(To you American's that like saying I'm going from New York to Washington DC thru LA)), this was a easy preventable mistake ( let's you know how retarded all the staff and the actors are). Then there's the bulletproofness of the star's Megan and Shia. What can I say if America uses this weapons in a war it's obvious why they haven't won anything sins the second world war. Then something positive Megan Fox running in slow-motion . But after the sweet comes the sour. They've been running thru a dessert for miles/ km but they don't sweat (nobody in the movie does)( If I was in a 40 C dessert I would sweat before walking let alone running for miles). Than the lovely Megan takes a dive in the sand but no sand sticks to her face. This movie was made by a bunch of amateurs. don't see the movie it really sucks!!!"

","What is going on with movies? What happened to movies with a story, that created suspense, that had action and adventure that was fun? I love a good Hollywood blockbuster but thanks to overuse of computer generated effects, clichés, mindless scripts, clichés, paper thin characters, clichés...well it's gotten boring and predictable beyond a joke. I was praying for this movie to end. The transformers are not fun, they're not even cartoonish, they're just stupid. I did not care for any of these characters. The only one that came close was John Turturro's, at least he was funny. And the use of slow motion action just prolonged the agony. I wanted the terminators to enter and wipe them all out. At least wipe out the parents, surely there was enough bullet fire to get Shia's mum in the forehead, she should have been the first to go. The action scenes are not enjoyable as you can't see what is going on as the lens was not wide enough. Just a mish-mash of computer generated robot body parts filling the screen with ample sound effects. Please Mr Hollywood, make movies that are great again and stop this pointless dribble. Sadly we learnt last year that you can't revisit the great days of Indiana Jones because of stupid stories and pointless plots, and now they're talking Indy 5 ... noooooooooooooooo! Okay, I'm ready for the abuse from fans now."

","Three words perfectly describe this film: Visually annoying stupidity. If you want simply a treat for the eyes then you have to settle for glimpses of Megan Fox because the CGI is as bad as the first film. If, like me, you are annoyed by an idiotic plot and tons of nonsensical issues, then stay away from this dud.<br/><br/>What happened? This really is a good cast, what should have been interesting characters, but a boring story. I just didn't care what happened to them. The legend generated by the first film has properties that just were missing from the story. Not much action, not enough story. Unfortunately, this sequel joins the dreaded list of disasters. This one is as bad as Superman 3, the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels, and the Joel Batman films."

","There are few cases where I look at my watch during a FREE movie to see how much pain will be left.

Okay, so if you like CG, explosions, slang and street talking robots with gold teeth, nonsensical plot holes, and a sequel that copies the original then this is your movie. But if you like plot, characters, something that resembles the Transformers cartoon of the 80's and 90's, not having your childhood memories used to rob you, and a director that knows what he's doing please for the love of all that is holy, STAY AWAY!!!"
"diac228","4","17","41","24 June 2009"," More of the same. Except its just the same. Just more of it.
","Bigger is better; that's what Hollywood and the Michael Bay team believes. They believe that if you hurl everything from the first film, enhance it a gajabazillion times, and then enhance it even more, you'll have a better film. This mathematical formula has been used for action blockbusters since the early 80s when Empire Strikes Back unleashed its sequelness for the world to see. However, for years, we critics (and moviegoers) have shouted back: ""Check the math!!!"" Well, we don't really actually say that, but sometimes more of something is too much of something---get what I am saying? Let's simplify: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is basically the original film except louder, longer, more stereotypical, and even more anti-climactic. All the strengths and flaws from the original transform their way into the sequel, and the end result is another Michael Bay firestorm of explosions (you know the kind, in which there are explosions inside explosions).<br/><br/>In Transformers 1 ½ (my interpretation, my title) we follow Sam as he heads off to college. But, trouble is brewing as a source of unspeakable energy is being hunted by the enemy (that sounds awfully familiar). Before you know it, evil transformers are everywhere, and our heroes see themselves being overwhelmed by the enemy and also by the United States whom is finding Prime and his followers more a burden than helpful. 8 million dollar script gets you a repeat of the original script, with more dialogue and more backstory. Call me crazy, but in a franchise known for the fights and the awesome robots, do we really need deep conversations about relationships? Roberto Orci (writer of Star Trek and several episodes of Alias) should know better. The other writers, well, their (Ehren Kruger and Alex Kurtzman) previous work wasn't as impressive.<br/><br/>More. More is the recurring theme to this film. More transformers, more characters, more action, more talking, more exploding, more music, more comic relief, more build-up, more fights, more close-ups, more special effects, more scenery, more military vehicles and weaponry, more stereotypes, more danger, more deaths, and to top it all off, more animal humping. There was more Megan Fox showing off her body instead of her acting. There was more from the parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), as they throw in more sexual humor and a surprising bit of drug-related humor as well. The parents was actually one of the better portions of the movie, as they provided the best comic relief; much better than the hoards of transformers whose only job was to attempt to make the audience laugh.<br/><br/>In a film that has more, there are surprisingly less of other elements. There was less Optimus Prime than the original, there was actually less robot-on-robot fighting, as more of the action sequences involved the military going at it against the robots (Funny how we only see the United States military in the entire movie despite the fact that the fighting took place in two other countries). Michael Bay cannot deny he loves the military and the weaponry brought, since this film could have passed off as an Army recruitment video describing and showing just what the United States army is capable of. Bay himself dons the same directing techniques as all his other films; the man is coming off as a one-trick pony.<br/><br/>Despite all the setbacks, you will see this film for one main reason: the special effects. The special effects team yet again delivers some of the best work in history, as the transformers themselves look absolutely fantastic and full of detail. The special effects never drop from prime quality, and is the main strength in the entire film. The fights themselves do improve, as the scope and range allow us to accurately see who is fighting whom. Unfortunately, the third act is where almost all the intense and gigantic action is, as the previous two acts had little blurbs of action. What hampers Transformers 1 ½ even more is that like in the original, the final battle (and the ending itself) is extremely anti-climactic. When the main and grand finale does appear, you are already tired from all the build-up that happened for about 45 minutes. There just wasn't enough activity coming from our robotic heroes, all the focus was on the military.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Am I being too harsh to a blockbuster flick? Most people would say so but guess what, summer action blockbusters can be noisy, explosive, and smart at the same time. This has been proved with the likes of Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Last Crusade, True Lies, Speed, Pirates of the Caribbean, Terminator 2, and even Michael Bay's very own The Rock. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen will satisfy the action junkies loosely, but only if they are willing to accept all the drawbacks, especially that of the franchise changing from robots vs. robots to man vs. robots. 150 minutes, several stereotypes, hundreds of explosions, and a couple dues ex mahcinas later, a weak sequel arrives.<br/><br/>The ironic thing is I grade this film the same as the original. So, more does not equal better in this case, and more does not equal worse either. It just means, more of the same, and it's the same sort of stuff that prevents this franchise from ever being halfway-decent."
"chadd firchau","1","12","27","7 June 2011"," boo.
","When my boy fires up this movie, I'm like ""hey Shia LaBeouf is a pretty good actor!"" and then I was like ""wow, they got Optimus Prime's voice spot on!"" I think those are the only two good things about the movie. <br/><br/>Let me tell you right now, son. These transformers look awful. All the decepticons look the same. I could never tell which one was megatron or starscream. The worst part of all, however, is that they all have human mouths. and when they talk, their faces move. like I mean, the metal parts of their faces stretch out like they were just painted on someone's cheek. Why use CGI if you're gonna make it look that tacky? Might as well just use guys in costumes. Am I right, men? <br/><br/>But check it out, the humans have this fragment of the ""all star"" which is a doomsday device that can drain our sun of all its energy. and the decepticons want to get their hands on it cuz they're evil and awesome. The autobots wanna help, but the humans are all ""nah we're good, we got that all locked away nice and tight."" What? They're alien robots with super technology! Come on! and then the movie makes the military look like incompetent buttholes that can't even aim as the decepticons use their super technology to steal the device. <br/><br/>The worst part of all is when optimus prime dies. He drives off into the woods and his autobot buddies are right behind him. But then his buddies disappear for like 20 minutes, while he has to fight every decepticon in the universe all by himself. Then he pops glowing blades out of his hands. Not guns, but glowing blades, and fights everyone like he's in the game God of War. RIGHT after he dies, the other autobots finally show up. I guess they all got a flat tire at the exact same time. Then there's all this drama and blah blah, and then Shia LaBeouf says ""...bring Optimus Prime back to life!"" <br/><br/>This movie will insult your intelligence no matter how old you are. This movie bad."

","I may lack the deep comprehension that others take for granted because it was unclear to me what the purpose was of having a shot of John Turturro's skinny white bum in a thong.<br/><br/>I wonder what kind of strange drug cocktail Michael Bay was taking when he shot this colossal turd of a movie. I'm going guess a mix of weed, shrooms, and meth - all at the same time.<br/><br/>Weed would explain all the horrible inconsistencies. Shrooms would explain the multitude of flat-out weird scenes. Meth would explain the completely spasmodic use of music and shooting sequences.<br/><br/>I can honestly say that Transformers II: Revenge of the fallen is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. This bombastic cornball of a movie violates every single rule of effective film-making that ever was.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay is to film-making what George W. Bush is to gangsta rap.<br/><br/>This movie should be renamed: Revenge of the Continuity Errors. Jesus Christ, there are endless continuity errors! Whenever Bey wants a prop in a scene, it just *magically* appears with no plausible explanation as to why it is there.<br/><br/>For example, Shia magically has a knife in the Smithsonian scene. Shia's hand magically appears in a full-cast even through they're in the middle of the desert when he injures it. Megan magically appears in new clothing several times. The military guys magically get a shiny clean Ford Ram out of nowhere. Shia and Megan magically have flashlights when they go to explore the matrix temple.<br/><br/>Further, the movie abruptly jumps from scene to scene like some crazed stoner running around a Safeway looking for the ice cream.<br/><br/>Speaking of ""matrix"", there are several complete rip-offs from ""The Matrix"" movies, especially the one where Shia ""dies"" and Megan says she loves him to bring him back from the dead. It's shot and worded almost *exactly* like it is in the first of the Matrix movies. - Lame.<br/><br/>Wait! Listen! What's that noise?<br/><br/>Oh, it must be John Turturro rattling off some pointless exposition for the upteenth time!<br/><br/>The two clearly Black robots in the movie can't read and one of them has a gold tooth. They both talk & act ghetto. The message I got is that black people are funny and have funny mannerisms.<br/><br/>Don't ask me about Asians, though, because there's not a single one in the entire movie. I guess they don't exist.<br/><br/>There are *so* many graphic sexual innuendos that it's a wonder this film isn't rated R. The first scene with the professor is off the scale. Also lots of humping. We see the dogs humping several times and even a Decepticon humping Megan's leg. <br/><br/>Every girl at the College that Shia goes to is a babe and dresses like a slut. That's realistic.<br/><br/>Nearly every scene with Shia and Megan is presented in melodramatic 90210 / One Tree Hill style complete with a montage and music. You almost expect Kelly to walk up and confess her love for Dylan.<br/><br/>Bay also makes up ""facts"" whenever he feels like it, has action music at completely inappropriate times, recycles both footage and dialog from the previous movie, has lots of pointless slo-mo shots, and lots of scenes that do nothing to advance the film in any way.<br/><br/>Congratulations, Michael Bay, you are the worst director in the entire universe.<br/><br/>You've even managed to beat out M. Night Shamalamadingdong and Rob Schneider. That's saying something."

","Optimus Prime and the gang are back! Funnier than ever, with a bigger budget, Transformers 2 came through with the promise of being more about the robots. Well, almost. This time around Sam is attending college but a piece of the Allspark got caught on his shirt and the piece that was ""hidden"" has been stolen.<br/><br/>All the key people have returned to reprise their roles. The developing relationship between Mikaela and Sam is romantic and funny, with the ability for any couple to relate to what their going through - despite the alien robotic race.<br/><br/>Action scenes are stuffed with loads of special effects and new robots are introduced. Story-wise it sticks to the comics/TV show and stays loyal to it's large fan base.<br/><br/>Ending felt contrived and seemed to lack a certain feeling I can't pinpoint. I found myself kinda asking ""is this over yet?"" few times and checking the time left.<br/><br/>It's rare for me to find a sequel that is better than the original, but it can happen. This isn't one of those times, because the original is still better between the two films. However, it's not a bad film. Far from it. It's entertaining, it's fun and it's hilarious.

"williamsn411","1","12","27","17 July 2009"," I really wish I could have my 2 1/2 hrs back
","You know, I didn't think it was possible for me to be bored with an action scene. But, after watching Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen...I have been proved wrong. I thought the first transformers movie was pretty good, nothing fantastic or anything but I enjoyed it. This one, on the other hand, was not enjoyable for me at all. First off, we get no character development for the auto-bots. And, when I say ""no character development"" I mean that I didn't even know the names of the new auto-bots in the film. This movie is 2 hrs of stuff blowing up...I'm serious. After the first 30 minutes of watching robots blowing each other up, I got extremely bored. Since I didn't give a crap about any of the robots, I thought maybe I would care about the humans...nope. I remember in the first film how Shia's character was a very likable goof ball, in this one he is a complete a**hole. Megan's character is just there for pure eye candy, no emotional attachment with her at all.<br/><br/>Something that I really wanted to mention was the editing of this movie. Many scenes in this film made me go ""WTF?"". For example, in one scene we see mega-tron beating up star scream and saying something to the effect of ""I'll always be the leader of the decepticons"". Then, in the very next scene we see mega-tron bowing down to another decepticon and referring to that decepticon as ""master""...WTF? Another example is when Shia and Megan are running away from a female decepticon. In the scene they have gotten into the car and have already burnt rubber while the female decepticon is casually walking out the school they were just in and watching Shia and Megan drive away...*cut to the very next scene* we see Shia and Megan in the car and Megan says something to the effect of ""she's on our tail""...WTF? Did I blink and miss something? One final example is when Shia and Megan are driving around in Egypt looking for something and then all of a sudden Megan says ""oh no, the cops!!!"" and then we see like 3 Egyptian police cars chasing them...WTF? Where the hell did those cops come from? Why are they chasing them? Then!!!...then in the very next scene after seeing Shia and Megan in the car freaking out about the cops...they cut to Megan in some Egyptian town wearing a burka...W...T...F? And don't even get me started on the stupid fart humor (robots having testicles, robots humping peoples legs). And did we really need to see Turturro's a**? Seriously? Also, lets not forget the blatant sexism in this movie. Women in this film are absolutely nothing except sex toys. There were 3 female auto-bots. Two of the three had no lines at all, while the third had one...ONE! The third one who had a line in the movie, immediately got blown up after she said her line...Jesus, could this film be anymore blatantly sexist? Not to mention that obvious racial stereotype with the twin auto-bots. They conveniently look like monkeys (big ears, big noses and big lips), talk in urban slang/ebonics and have gold teeth...hmm...I wonder who those characters are suppose to represent. I'm surprised that I haven't heard anything from the NAACP about this.<br/><br/>God, I really wish I could have my 2 1/2 hrs back. If this movie had made even the slightest bit of sense, I would have liked it a little bit more. This movie was without a doubt, one of the worst movies I've seen this year. In fact, it was so bad that it made the first transformers movie look like the godfather."

Everything from the cinematography to the visual and sound effects were amazing.It just sort of reminded me the very reason for watching a movie in the theater.

","I think it is a horrible movie. It is like a Bruckheimer movie mocking itself, his style is degenerated here, it is chaotic, overdone, messy, senseless, witless, stupid to the extreme. One of the worst directed and scripted movies ever and probably the worst Bruckheimer movie so far. And those nasty, sleazy allusions to the sexiness of Megan Fox, as if she were a sex toy and not an actress. LeBouf seems to do the same role again and again, and with his lack of good looks (or rather his ridiculous looks) I suspect his 15 minutes at the box office is to be soon over. I simply do not see what is interesting or talented in this guy, his looks are none and his acting range seems limited. I was not too hot on the 1st Transformers film but it had some redeeming qualities, yet this one is much worse."

One guy beside me asked his buddy ""How much longer til this is over?"".<br/><br/>My problems with this movie: Terrible story (if there was one), atrocious acting, and the dialogue at times was annoying...especially the dialogue of the Transformers. Since when do Transformers swear, insult other humans, and have mechanical testicles? And I am not the most dedicated fan of Transformers, but I thought they only took forms of machines and NOT humans. Where did that come from? If I were Shia, I would walk away from this franchise before it takes my career down to the pits...where this movie landed."

","The first Transformers movie caught me off guard. It was perhaps one of my favorites in 2007. The first movie managed to be action packed and fast paced, yet meted out enough character development and plot to make it a good time and worth the 10 bucks I paid to see it. I couldn't wait for the sequel and I wish I had waited...forever or at least until it was in a el-cheapo DVD bin.<br/><br/>The most glaring flaw in this film was the apparent after-thought addition of a plot, if one could even call it a plot. And yes, I know it's an action film and didn't expect a deep plot, but something, anything to keep me interested would have been helpful. Here is how the film proceeds: Opening: great sound and cool robot fighting...<br/><br/>and then it just went on and on and on and on and on and on like that until I simply didn't care anymore. I began to think they put all of the money into repetitive effects and nothing else. Hey Hollywood! Special effects are only special if you don't try to build a film on effects alone! I was so bored at the lack of plot that I began to sing the Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny by Lemon Demon and hoping that Mr. Rogers would emerge the victor and save me from the trite, blurry robot fighting. That's right, cool robot fighting ceases to be entertaining when nothing else seems to happen for the first half of a movie. Close ups of Megan Fox scantily clad and pouty do not count as story. That seemed to be the only respite and she bored me quickly too. By the time the wafer-thin plot was introduced, they had lost me. If the sound effects hadn't been so loud, I would *chosen* to take a nap.<br/><br/>Overall this ended up feeling like an extended toy ad, a series of product placements, and an ad for the military. There were attempts at humor, most of which will amuse the 12 year-olds to whom they want to sell toys. If you are beyond puberty, you are likely to groan at most of the jokes, even occasionally wonder if the script writers were eating the ""special brownies"" Sam's mother enjoyed so much.<br/><br/>On the bright side, this would be a great movie for drinking games in frat houses, if the goal is hospital-bound alcohol poisoning. If you find it on DVD for 5 bucks and really like counting plot holes, continuity errors, and generally laugh at pitiful movies, you might have fun with it."

","I went in expecting perhaps some improvement on the first but no such luck. I expected to see more of the Transformers, well numerically, yes we do, but in screen time its roughly the same amount. Perhaps the Transformers are on screen more often in this sequel, but in such a manner that they don't add to the story or plot, or action, so to my mind there was no improvement. The Fallen of the title is wasted as a device to bring a sense of danger. He is in two scenes, the large part of this movie concerning itself with Shia LeBouf and his bumbling human (and Transformer) pals. Optimus Prime is wasted, leaving the action early and coming back at the end for a brief turn.<br/><br/>What little plot there is is stretched thinly, padded out with jokes about dogs humping other dogs and Transformers humping human legs. Characters appear at random serving little purpose to further the story, being there simply because Michael Bay thought ""Hey this would look cool"".<br/><br/>The whole movie is an example of what can happen when a director ignores characters and story in favour of ""Hey this would look cool"". Any emotion you may have felt towards Sam is drowned out by the soundtrack or cheesy slow motion. Megan Fox character is once again there just to look pretty, and unfortunately, lots of people will fall for that.<br/><br/>So if you value story, memorable dialogue and don't want to have a frontal lobotomy to enjoy a film, don't even bother with Transformers 2. I sat through all of it hoping it would get better and it didn't."

The Special FX were overdone (of course overdone special FX is Bay's trademark) 99 percent of the jokes were not funny. The storyline was uninteresting, which to be fair is more due to the source material giving little to work with than the movie's own fault.<br/><br/>I wasn't really interested in seeing a sequel in the first place but ended up seeing it anyways at the Drive-in along with Harry Potter and damn everything that was wrong with the first one is multiplied by 100. The special effects are so overused and so over the top that I was almost convinced Bay was making fun of himself. An apple falls in slow motion for Christ Sake! I don't think there was a single scene in the movie that didn't implement computer rendered effects. Not a single joke was funny. The mom getting high was so stupid and overdone. The dog's humping was pointless and stupid. The movie was too long for an incoherent mess of a plot. <br/><br/>In short this movie makes the first one look like Citizen Kane by comparison."

","ONE out of TEN....(minimum available) <br/><br/>I came to the conclusion that I was watching a steaming pile of s%*t about 10 minutes into this debacle, and without sounding dramatic If I hadn't paid good money to see it I would happily have walked out of the cinema at that point.<br/><br/>I feel I have a duty to play my part to get the overall score of this movie as low as possible (at time of this review 7.2 out of 10, WAY to high).<br/><br/>Why such hostility towards the movie? I will explain what I hated so much about it.<br/><br/>1. First two minutes, 17,000 BC. Please.....<br/><br/>2. The whole Witwicky family, especially that annoying (now turned comedian) Mother. The college scene where she makes a complete twit of herself?? WTF....<br/><br/>3. Every supermodel/porn-star shot of Mikaela, cringe, cringe and lets all cringe again. Megan Fox can't act for toffee. The conversation at the start on the phone to Sam, the music during it. WTF....<br/><br/>4. In an age of technology (That Michael Bay is constantly making us aware of) How the hell do these Robots stay a secret. Causing carnage in Shanghai, anyone got a camera phone handy? Obviously not as Prime and his buddies still remain top secret after their mission, and what a confusing blend of CGI that mission was....<br/><br/>5. Characters that are annoying to the EXTREME or none existing in their development. The twins?? and who are all these other Transformers?? WTF....<br/><br/>6. Is this a kids movie? The first certainly catered for all ages but not this one. However I'm also confused as the level of pornographic/adult humour was intense, it wasn't even cleverly ambiguous or subtle, just totally in your face. So much so I'm pretty sure even the kids knew what was going on with some of the comments....<br/><br/>7. Shia having his mental breakdown stage. WTF....and ANNOYING....<br/><br/>8. Michaels constant (wet dream on film) love for the US Military. ENOUGH we know you're a boy scout, Superman isn't as bad as this idiot. Why, Michael do ALL your movies look and play out the same? (Explosions, slow-mo, golden sun, explosion, USA military rules, more slow-mo etc etc etc....) Give it up or at least try to evolve as a film maker....<br/><br/>9. The amount of running, goodness sake Sam had to run and run and run. Use Bumblebee? Also how BAD are the decepticons at killing people? <br/><br/>10. TOO many comic reliefs, Sam room-mate, the parents, the twins, Sector 6 guy, please too many STOP....<br/><br/>11. Plot/script....totally useless and almost non-existent.<br/><br/>12. Acting from EVERYONE (With the exception of a couple of voice actors).<br/><br/>13 Last but not least, the direction. Utterly disastrous.<br/><br/>I could keep going but will leave it at 13. I enjoyed the first movie, so was cautiously looking forward to the sequel, hoping it could grow the Transformers universe and build on the good foundations of the first. How wrong I was, this was appalling. MIND NUMBINGLY APPALLING....<br/><br/>Oh and as for the ""What do you expect from a movie about giant robots"" attitude to criticism of this movie. Well I expect EVEN a popcorn summer blockbuster to have some level of plot and depth. Certainly beyond the 5 year old humour, US Military recruitment video's and CGI warriors CONSTANTLY fighting each other we have on display here. I can switch off my brain and still follow at least some kind of coherent plot. <br/><br/>The spectacle of the CGI effects has ran its course,its no longer ""WOW that amazing, look at Optimus transform!"" You need to have more than that up your sleeve Mr Bay. Star Trek this summer indicates you can have crazy CGI, appropriate humour with some depth, and STILL have a popcorn summer blockbuster. <br/><br/>AVOID."

","First of all I have to admit that the graphics were outstanding, the movie over all wasn't boring and way better than the first one acting wise _except for this new character ""Leo Spitz"". However talking about huge production that coast $ 200 Million the movie had huge and unforgivable problems:  Michael bay is known for his action directing career, still in his previous movies (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor & the Island) he paid great deal of attention to the human side of the character which was totally missing here except for cheesy few lines here and there and it was mostly made by the Robots; for me Megan Fox's lines were non sense and unnecessary at all considering the situation they were in the movie especially the ending part.  It's amazing how a whole make up department which included around 8 people in charge didn't notice Megan fox's perfect make up and amazingly glowing lip glues through the movie!! What's up with the full make up through fighting a whole army of Aliens in the middle of the Egyptian desert?? Seriously?!!!  Egypt and Jordan scenes: where to start with that?!!! I'm an Arab, and it's a shame to say that the American cinema still portraits the Arabic countries as a huge Desert with few barbarians and camels here and there, not to mention the dump midget police man, the crappy Egyptian and Jordanian borders and the 5 minutes distance between Egypt and Jordan!!! What's the deal here, why all this conspiracy from huge production companies to manipulate the Arabic image along with the Arabic countries? It's 2009 now and I think a 6 years old kid would know the truth if he googled it!! Honestly; I blame both the Egyptian and the Jordanian governments for allowing such movies to be shot in their countries with out any knowledge of the story contains."

If you think Megan fox is not hot then u should be circumcised because in this movie she is the hottest girl i have seen in ages if not ever. This was by far the best movie of the year and i can say this right now if this was on a Friday they would have sold 20 mill on the first day and destroyed the newest Batman's record. But if u don't see this movie the only reason should be because you didn't see the first.

","Most of the time, the reason I don't like movies is because their not made for me. For instance, I don't really enjoy chick-flicks, or sports films, but I can appreciate their purpose and understand why other people enjoy them. Most of the time, they don't make me angry, just bored. Most of the time I can sit through a boring movie and still have a good time if I'm with someone else who likes it. ButTransformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is the most disgusting, vile, atrocious, mind-numbing, vomit-inducing piece of trash movie I personally have had the misfortune to watch to date. And I really meant that. IT IS GARBAGE. What is it, you ask? What in the world could be this terrible? . Some who have seen it disliked it, but didn't loathe it as much as I did. Some have simply said, ""oh, it's just a movie. It doesn't bother me that much. Besides, the action was good"". Some even enjoyed it. To the latter group, I say go see a doctor, you're insane. Literally. Normally, I would side with the first group. I am able to accept that movies are in fact just that: movies. They're not going to change the world, and they're not going to change the course of humanity as we know it. But no. NO, NO, NO. I have never been so physically full of rage over a movie in my entire life. It insulted my intelligence, and my humanity. This film, if you can even call it that, first and foremost is not entertaining on any level whatsoever. Second, 2007's Transformers is not a good movie, but it is entertaining. Its solid PG-13 rating was just fine with me, even though it was almost exclusively marketed towards children. It was primarily rated because of action violence, and since all the fighting is between giant robots, there's no gore to speak of. However, the sequel barely squeaked by a PG-13 rating because it is chock full of sexual crudeness, foul language, sexism, racism and drug use; most of which pertain to THE ROBOTS THEMSELVES. And yes, you did read that correctly. The merchandise for this movie also was marketed exclusively for children as young as two. So, realize this before I go into my rant about the film itself. This is supposed to be a kids movie. Heh, heh...yeeaah.... The filmmakers had already angered me by making an edgy yet still OK movie for tweens and up, then reeling fans of the first movie into a film that was something totally different and shocking after reading a few reviews after the movie was released, but before I actually went to see it. And, if anyone was hoping for a climactic battle between Optimus Prime and The Fallen, all you got was a two minute brawl that is composed of insane close-ups which look like a mass of indistinguishable metal rotating around and around. By the way, this is how every battle in this movie looks, thus its safe to say the action is not even good. The End. That's it.<br/><br/>The real question is: how in the world was a weekly Saturday morning cartoon about giant robots fighting each other made INTO THIS? I'll never know. But, I'm sure that's another question that will never be answered by Michael Bay."

However, in reading it prior to my viewing of the movie I could not believe that the movie could be that bad! Afterall Peter and I do not always agree...<br/><br/>Two and a half wasted hours of my life later all doubts of Mr. Travers' critique were shattered...<br/><br/>I sat there stunned at the end of the movie by how appalling the piece of crap really was! Mr. Bay apparently couldn't help himself in managing to blow every thing in sight up, including any hope of making a decent movie! I was bored out of my freaking mind during the e-n-t-i-r-e duration of the movie! Meagan Fox's acting was worse than her performance in the first one, Shia played the same animated character he always does, but the screenplay has the pleasure of having the worst performance of all! It did not even try to keep a steady plot together. All it managed to do was leave a giant door open for Micheal Bay to come in and blow stuff up! And don't even get me started on the robots (reading the other comments will sum up my opinion about them quite nicely).<br/><br/>And what's worse than sacrificing good brain cells just to keep my sanity during the movie? Having to listen to all the morons rave about how good it was! I mean come on! Are you people that easy? Does it really only take 2 1/2 hrs. of explosions and fluff to entertain you? What is happening to America? Thanks to the fan base the movie has and the monstrous box office gross ""we the people"" are going to encourage a third atrocity to be put into the hands of Michael Bay as he probably feels like a king right now.

And that sudden scene of two dogs humping ? What was the point ?? Bots with Testicles (Literally Shouted in the theater 'WTF')??? Are you trying to rush a KFC Mighty Zinger or what ? I pointed out a million goofs in the movie myself (not that I am a movie critic I love movies) If the Decepticon Chick had the time to seduce Sam why couldn't she just kill him then ? If Sam had written all the cube stuff on the walls why couldn't she just read it from there ??<br/><br/>Why Why Why ??? Why could I just see Megan Fox's Boobs in every scene ? So now Bots age too ? I was dying to figure out why did they land on Egypt ?

","I was actually excited about this movie as I really enjoyed the first one. Where do I begin with what's wrong with this movie? It was essentially the U.S. Military vs. the Deceptecons. There were basically three Autobots in the movie: Bumblebee (who somehow couldn't talk again, even though he could at the end of the first one), and TWO Jar-Jar Binks's. Ironhide and Ratchet were in it but inexplicably absent for most of the movie and some other one that never transformed so I had no idea what it was supposed to be. There were a pile of new Decepticons but little to no new Autobots. Oprimus Prime was dead for most of the movie but was resurrected to defeat the ""bad guys"" is less than two minutes by somehow acquiring some advanced weaponry from an ""old"" Deceptecon with a cane for God's sake! Ahh!!!. Shia Labouf and Megan Fox were awful. First of all, Megan Fox couldn't act her way out of wet paper bag so watching her trying to emote was just painful. The special effects somehow turned out worse than the first movie. Michael Bay's attempt to add comedy to this was laughable, and I don't mean that it in a good way. The scene where the kid's mom gets high on marijuana was the FIRST time I wanted to walk out, but certainly not the last. It's really depressing because the first one was so good. Shame on you Michael Bay for destroying a perfectly good series. Finally, what was the deal with a transformer turning into a person? I don't remember them having that capability when I was a kid. I guess they double as Terminators now."

","OK, let me start off by saying that I am not a racist, but I think Transformers with gold-teeth is completely ""whack"". This film caters to the lowest common denominator in society. I know its just a summer action flick, but c'mon, Mr. Bay, can't you do better than this?...apparently not. Look, I love a great robot fight, and explosions as much as the next immature 41-year-old, but please, at least make an effort to employ the context of a plot or at least some interesting characters. If I wanted to sit through a Saturday morning 2 1/2-hour long toy commercial, I would have stayed home in my P.J.'s and watched the adverts on Nickelodeon. Anyway, congratulations Mr. Bay, you have now joined the ranks of such great filmmakers as Paul Verhoven, Mc ""D"" (I mean ""G""), and Ed Wood. Uh,...never mind, at least Ed Wood made an effort,... oh, and he had no money...<br/><br/>To sum it up, 1 star for the movie, and 10 Stars for Mr. Bay, as the worst Director in Movie History.<br/><br/>Good Luck with Transformers III, Revenge of the Movie-going Public.

"Dark Raven","2","11","25","22 June 2009"," A snuffy mess
","You know you're in for a royal mess of a script when the scene which kicks the whole story off is the main character conveniently 'just so happens' to find a piece of 'the all spark' in his jacket!? Followed by a totally unnecessary gremlin-transformers blow up the house scene. We find Bumblebee is being kept in the garage like a bloody dog... Toilet humor... Very quickly the smile on my face from the opening Shanghai sequence (which looked great, along with a forest fight later on) quickly started to fade. <br/><br/>From here to got worse. Shias crazy roommate (who serves what purpose?) Shia caught cheating with a TX from Terminator 3 (yes, I'm not kidding). Annoying 'stuck in there' scenes with Shias parents. Where there wasn't stupid, loud, humour, there was explosions.<br/><br/>The constant noise and explosions and grey messes of metal fighting wore thin on me very quickly. Action needs breathers, set up, anticipation. And give the robots some colour for Christ's sake! The movie did not need the comic relief of what people are calling the racist 'jar-jar twins' but I enjoyed the seeing some primary colours I have to say. All in all though, this movie was the pornographic equivalent of a 2 hour close up of a knob ramming an a'hole. Maybe some people want that but I don't want to see it. Show us a little foreplay, a little tease, change position, anything!<br/><br/>Speaking of porn, that's also the reason Megan Fox didn't work. She looks like she's in the wrong business. She also has zero charisma or personality (though the writers could be to blame here). You see makaela would have worked if she was smoking hot in a pretty sense and a touch down to earth (attainable) so an audience could dream their were Sam. We would of related to her more and therefore cared about her. It also would have made the T-X 'seductress' work in the film work. But she's less hot than the ott megan! Talk about the girlfriend experience. How much is Sam paying for the privilege? And the story spoke of being faithful? Come on, how could you trust Fox? Seriously. In skimpy shorts and low tops hanging around motorcycle grease monkeys all day? Add this to dogs dry humping, robot radio control cars dry humping... Who is this movie aimed at? <br/><br/>I mostly enjoyed the first film. It worked for the most part and felt like the story had been worked and then shot, as opposed to being shot while they worked it out. I think the transformers franchise could of worked brilliantly. It needed more 'Berg less Bay though. Given us a touch of wonder and magic...<br/><br/>Star Trek still makes the summer a success. That was so enjoyable it counts for two movies.

","OK so the action sequences are reasonably good and there is at the very least the semblance of a plot if we are being generous but the acting, scripting, continuity and grip of reality are without doubt poor.<br/><br/>Geography is often missing from Hollywood films and this is no different with the sphinx being conveniently moved to Jordan and Israel removed from the map (may increase sales in Palestine).<br/><br/>My big bug bare was continuity, for a film in the hundreds of millions of dollars a little care could have been taken to ensure that the sun was in a similar location during a scene or that Sam's scars could stay on the same side of his neck or even the predator spy plane keeping a propeller for both its scenes instead of being upgraded to a jet.<br/><br/>Some people may enjoy this film but I'm not sure how."
"Aaron1375","9","8","17","30 June 2009"," Optimus Prime shows his stuff in much improved action scenes.
","The action in this movie was great, the battles being better than any found in the first movie, so why did I give the first movie a 10 and this one a nine? Well, for one the first movie was well the first movie. I had not seen the Transformers on the big screen and not even bigger action scenes can make up for the freshness of the first one when also the story and some parts of the movie were not all that great. The story goes here and there and near the end when I knew the final showdown was looming the movie kept adding stupid dialog scenes such as Shia and his gal talking and trying to figure stuff out. Two of the new Autobot's were so annoying that I cheered when one appeared to be eaten and then there is Soundwave, I can roll with him being a satellite, but why did he have Dr. Claw's voice from Inspector Gadget rather than the voice he had on the cartoon that would have been rather easily duplicated as all you need is a voice modulator of some kind. Still, there were some humorous scenes once again involving Sam's parents and the action scenes were very great I loved all the major confrontations involving Optimus Prime that is for sure, Bumblebee too gets to kick some major booty as well. The story could use work, it is not quite as hard to follow as some claim, but it is overly complicated in areas. Basically, for the most part the movie revolves around what appears to be the Decepticons true leader known as the Fallen and his desire to use a device that would be very bad for us on Earth. So be prepared to be a little annoyed as the twins will talk, Sam's new roomie will annoy as well, and look forward to a runtime of over 2 hours and twenty minutes twenty minutes of which could have easily been cut, but with all the bad comes a lot of good too. Loads of very cool battles involving the Autobots and Decepticons, and let's face it that is the reason you want to see a Transformer's movie."
"wmhogg","10","9","20","3 July 2009"," Good action film, not as much fun as the first.
","First of all, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. Some of the things that bothered me have to do with comic relief, and I just simply let those go, like the ""humping"" of Megan Fox's leg by the little robot.<br/><br/>More to substance, I thought that Megan Fox's character had been given a lobotomy since the last film. She had previously pretended to not be smart. She didn't want people to know that she knew a lot about automobiles, because, as she explained, guys don't like a girl smarter than them.<br/><br/>When the final battle occurred in the first film, Megan Fox's character lashed up Bumblebee and drove while he fired at the Decepticons. It was her idea. She was brave and smart. That was appealing.<br/><br/>Her cooing and dreamy eyes when looking at Sam, in ""Revenge of the Fallen"", would have almost tolerable, if she had not gone for the fake Marilyn Monroe voice, stereotypical of dumb blonds.<br/><br/>It seemed like no matter what was going on, all Megan Fox could do was look at him, with her lips parted, inviting him to kiss her. Even in the midst of battle, all she wanted was Sam to say, ""I love you"", first.<br/><br/>I like tough women in films. It's because I believe that they are just as capable as men. So give me Sigourney Weaver in ""Aliens"" over ""Revenge of the Fallen's"" Megan Fox any day. Lena Headey in the Sarah Connor Chronicles, was just one of many smart, tough women in the series.<br/><br/>So, all we got from Megan Fox was ""eye candy"", and not a substantive performance. Maybe that's all that mattered to Michael Bay.<br/><br/>I also was offended by the Jar-Jar negative stereotype ""guys from da hood"" represented by the Twins. I got over it eventually and laughed at many of their lines. I just wish it had not been so disrespectful and racially biased.<br/><br/>Those are my two problems with the movie. By the end, I was cheering like all the other people in the theater at Optimus Prime's triumph, and would go see it again."

If you can't enjoy the humor in this movie, but then want to go and rave about oh, say ""Napolean Dynamite"" or ""Borat."" Gimme a break. This movie was great.<br/><br/>Already crazy Mom on weed was funny!! Megan Fox was hot! Don't fault her for that or the director for capitalizing. Turturro had the same eccentricities that made T1 fun...and still got his moment in the sun. If you can't tell the difference between the robots, ask someone who grew up with them. Or check eye color. Or remember that gray is generally bad. Or does it really matter?? They ROCKED! Loved the storyline about the Fallen and the Primes and was quite glad we did NOT get all the information right at the front. Toss in a little suspense or twist. Anyways...<br/><br/>Please don't take this movie so seriously. Its a completely entertaining movie and an absolute pleasure to watch. I WILL see it again and WILL buy it on blu-ray!"
"ultra_pro","10","9","20","22 June 2009"," Simply astounding
","the first movie fulfilled my childhood dreams by bringing my beloved autobots to the big screen and although it wasn't exactly perfect, it was an amazing, entertaining and all round excellent blockbuster movie.<br/><br/>Fallen had me worried, I honestly thought they would mess it up some how, that Michael Bay would pull another Bad Boys 2 but my god I am so glad I was wrong. This is THE greatest movie I have ever seen, I'm not afraid to say it, I have never been so amazed and in awe while at the cinema, it simply blew me away.<br/><br/>The story is far better paced and less complicated than the first. One of the things that bugged me was that there were too many human elements and subplots screwing with the action, this time its more robots, more action and just an overall 100% improvement. The other main gripe I had with the first film was that you just didn't see enough of Optimus Prime, THE greatest Transformer of all time. He just wasn't on screen enough for me. Thank god Bay listened to the people and gave all the autobots far more screen time.<br/><br/>Anyway, to get to the point, you've never seen a blockbuster like this before, its sooo much fun and there is soo much excitement that I just could not control my emotions! I never thought I'd live to see a film like this, when I sat there as a 6 year old watching the original cartoon movie I could never have imagined that a film based on Transformers could be this amazing, this entertaining.<br/><br/>This is the greatest summer blockbuster you will ever see.<br/><br/>And I just learned that the film only opened in the UK and Japan? When the hell has that ever happened!! WOOOOOOOOT!!!!"

","Just got back from watching Transformers IMAX style and my head hurts. The film is everything you want from a Michael Bay film:- Tension, gags, attractive women and of course lots and lots of explosions. This film takes all of the aspects that audiences loved and critics hated from the last film and amped it up 7 notches. I found the film really enjoyable with great pacing and a nice mix of humour, simple plot and lots of action. But obviously the reason people go to see this film is for two reasons 1) the explosions and incredible special effects and 2) Megan Fox both in this film are amazing... to look at ahem. I think anyone who goes in with the intention of watching a summer blockbuster will be delighted with how this turned out... Spielberg is said to have told Bay that this is the best film Bay's ever done, obviously Spielberg would say that seeing as he's involved, but I have to agree with him on this one. Enjoy, the master of Krrrraaarrr and Kablaaaaaar is definitely on form... but be warned about possible criticism about racist issues that I expect will surround the film they are quite blatant."
"alisterblack22","1","10","23","15 November 2009"," I could go on, but I'll make this brief enough.
","I could write a legitimate novel on how horrendous this film was. I get tired of everyone who complains ""well, I just saw it for Megan Fox,"" or ""I just saw it for the action."" There is no justification for saying this film was anything better than what it is: an insult. Michael Bay is given enough money to feed an entire African nation and gives us THIS. The acting was awful, and I'll admit that in these sorts of films, usually, that would be no problem. But Mr. Bay went as far as to say that the acting wasn't only supposed to be good, but it was. His only redemption and HE squashes it. Kudos, idiot. And as for the writing, it's no secret as to the immature, offensive, plot-hole-filled wretchedness that shows no bounds; the transitions to new plot points are ridiculous (""We're on three of the most beautiful pyramids in the world, Sam""...""OH MY! That just gave me the epiphany that there are three stars! I KNOW WHERE THE MAGIC THING IS!""). The action is killed with awful, embarrassing one-liners said in monotonous old-man voices via the transformers, (""Ah-pull.. ovah!""). The main problem was that Mr. Bay's target audience wasn't really a single group. The idiotically immature humor could only be funny to a five-year old, but the sexuality wouldn't be allowed by most adults (John Turturro in a thong shouldn't be viewed by anybody, let alone children). And nobody could truly enjoy the plot, which is like a story trying to be told by somebody with an awful case of Tourettes. My point is, avoid this movie at all costs. The first was funny and entertaining, don't let this schlock ruin it."
"asim34522-1","8","10","23","16 July 2009"," I thought it really good
","I'm not a fan of Transformers, I haven't even seen the animated cartoons OR the 1st Transformers movie which came out in 2007. I saw the trailer for this movie and it pretty good and considering that many people said that the 1st one was absolutely excellent, I went and saw this one. I haven't seen the 1st Transformers movie but this was really good. Great effects, intense fighting scenes and Megan Fox. Megan Fox is well fit, she's probably one of the most sexiest actresses I've ever seen. The one bad this about the film is that the plot is unclear. Apart from that, well done Michael Bay for making this good piece of work. If there is a 3rd Transformers movie coming into cinemas and I sure hope there is, I'm going definitely going to watch it. Many people who have seen the 1st Transformers say that this is not as good but I haven't seen the n1st one and yet I think this is really good.<br/><br/>8/10"
"bigfoot7990","1","10","23","9 July 2009"," So Ridiculously Awful!! How could they even make a film this bad?
","This film is certainly one of the worst, successful films ever created. Michael Bay has continued his act of being the most hated director in Hollywood by creating one of the worst films anyone has ever seen. not only is the writing awful, it is almost embarrassing that this is successful. Not only is it bad, it is excruciating, I wonder if when the Department of Denseness used ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" on captured terrorist, one of the tactics was to show them this film. The only thing more mind boggling than how they would make a film this bad, is that why did the studio put up two hundred million dollars. I think this film will go down in history as one of the worst films to come out of the Hollywood machine."
"sidneyshroom","10","10","23","5 July 2009"," Transformers 2 IS GREAT
","I don't know what everyone is complaining about. When I was a kid watching Transformers the Autobots were personal...not just some special effect only for viewing. As kids we loved Prime and Bumble Bee. We thought Starscream was a little punk that was funny when he got beat down at the end of almost every episode. We loved seeing new transformers. This movie made me see the personality of the Autobots. Other than ONE time Megan Fox was not made the center of attention for sexuality...that part being when she was leaned over on the motorcycle. Myself and the audience laughed our butts off at their jokes. The plot was the Deceptacons trying to get Energon...that's back to basics. The Transformers battles was better than Part One. Not just a bunch of metal monsters crashing into each other...they actually fought this time. So you have your action...your humor...basic Transformer plot line....Megan Fox...and a few of those emotional tear jerkers. I may not know who the director is nor do I really care. The movies is Definitely worth seeing and for the FIRST time in a long time I was FAR from disappointed at the end. My opinion is this is a must see for any TRUE Transformer fan and even for the newbies. But when it comes down to it...it's up to you."
"Arm_the_Masses","2","10","23","29 June 2009"," Shockingly Bad
","To sum up what's wrong about this film is not easy to do with limited space. I happened to enjoy the first movie in spite of it's short comings but this second one just seemed all wrong.<br/><br/>A few things worth pointing out: 1) Too much. Of what? Of everything basically. There were SO many new robots and SO much action that it quickly became inanely repetitive and numbing. After a while it just wasn't effective. Classical example of less-is-more is Jaws where we don't even see the monster for the first hour of the movie. Well here it's a more-is-not-enough approach. Michael Bay seems so completely incapable of savoring the moment, of letting something hang in the air (except the rancid stink of movie gone horribly wrong), of having a few quiet moments. If you build up to, say, an action climax through taut and tense plotting then when that violent action moment comes it can be very effective. But here it's like every single scene is trying to out-do the previous one in terms of loud crashes, rapid camera movements and big explosions. I had a head-ache the rest of the day.<br/><br/>2) Jar-jar Binks syndrome. Those twin robots... omg... they were beyond embarrassing. And what's with the etnification of robots. Shocking.<br/><br/>3) Poorly written script. Everything from the dialog to characterization (okay, maybe a silly thing to be expecting from a Michael Bay movie, but still) was rank. Considering the target audience for this movie is kids I felt quite discouraged walking out of the cinema thinking how from a very young age crass gender roles a slammed into our children's heads with a 2-by-4. All hail the passive, male-pleasing role of the ridiculously dolled-up female lead."
"hbabcock_28","2","10","23","27 June 2009"," I seem to recall taking Transformers into sand was a bad idea...
","What an appalling piece of tripe.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is a hack. If there is any justice in the world, he will one day be kidnapped by people with actual talent. They will force him to watch his movies over and over in a Clockwork Orange chair until they break the soul he clearly doesn't have.<br/><br/>As someone who loves movies of all genres, Transformers 2 offends me on a deep personal level. Michael Bay's latest opus is a testament to the dark, greedy, soulless side of the movies. Anything for a buck, lowest common denominator, pandering to the base nature of humanity, crap.<br/><br/>That bad? Oh yes. And its insidious. There were 2 things in this movie that were better than the first one. The transformers transformed more slowly so you could actually see it happen... well, you would be able to if it didn't also look like the movie was edited in a wood chipper. The Transformers also had more personality, which was an improvement over last movie where the only way to tell which giant robot was Optimus was to look for the Mac Truck.<br/><br/>However, there is a dark side to these new personality-filled robots. The appearance of Amos and Andy in robot form was awful. Nothing like 2 buck-toothed, illiterate, bumbling, stereotypes to affirm that Michael Bay is either completely racist or completely naive. His comment that, ""they're robots,"" is moronic. And Jar Jar is just an alien.<br/><br/>There was so much action it was sort of like an assault which got increasingly tiring. Yeah, the special effects were pretty and the explosions were loud, but 2 hours and 40 minutes of straight Michael Bay action was incredibly boring. Part of that is his style. The aforementioned wood chipper editing does not help anything. You can barely see whats going on. Despite the loudness, I fell asleep. Twice. In a theatre seat. I've never been that bored in a movie in my life. And it was 2 hours and 40 friggin minutes long! Indulgent and vapid. There was not enough movie to justify it being that long.<br/><br/>The problem is the movie is all surface. There is an overly complicated plot, which really doesn't need to be there at all. Why explain giant killer robots in such depth? To appease the fan boys? I doubt that'll happen. They're already angry. And the plot is not engrossing. The characters are irritating. All the humor is fart and testicle jokes. The dialog... I'm actually in the process of repressing it, but robots + declarative = bad news bears. Out of self defense Michael Bay has to rely on fiery explosives and robots hitting each other with trees. He is incapable of every part of making a movie that is not special effects.<br/><br/>There was a love story, which mostly involved Megan Fox bending over and pouting and then her face spiraling around near the end in a completely mystifying moment. Of course, to show how epic the love was, Bay decides to spiral around our couple in 360 camera shots that directors don't generally use. They don't use them because they are disorienting for the audience and considered amateurish. So after 5 straight minutes of rotating cameras I was ready to vomit, and it wasn't entirely the revolting meditations on saying I wuv oo first from Shia and Fox.<br/><br/>You know, I can't actually do this movie justice. It was that bad. It was everything I hate in a movie. Everything. I think I died a little inside last night.<br/><br/>And Michael Bay? Please do not rape anymore of my childhood memories. I can't take it. You should be ashamed of yourself."

","As soon as mudflap and skids showed themselves it was pretty obvious that this movie had one primary goal, hook a new generation of fans for the transformer franchise, and to that end I think it worked. This move will definitely drive toy sales, and I think that's exactly what was intended of it, however it will also disappoint a lot of first gen fans.<br/><br/>Soundwave looked like the MIR space station with a transformer head jammed onto it, and sounded like an emphysema patient. They could have done so much more with this fan favourite. I'm not entirely sure but I think he was quickly killed off in the final battle, seen from a distant wide-angle shot.<br/><br/>Deceptions would randomly come back to life or be in two places at once, but Autobots would stay dead to suit the patched together story line which was almost identical to the first movie. Instead of the all-spark buried under the hoover dam it's the sun-killing machine buried under a pyramid this time.<br/><br/>Starscream and Megaton (or is it agent Smith?) both had their voices changed, for the worse, and Devastator (must be a popular transformer name, like Smith for us) looked and sounded like a gorilla. For a $200 mil movie the sound effects were cheap and tacky - Soundwave and Devastators vocals can both be heard in the first Mortal Kombat Movie as Shao Kahn and Goro respectively. Cloverfield created entirely original and amazing sound effects with a fraction of the TF2, and even less than the MK movie budget which was 1/4 that of TF2.<br/><br/>Bumblebee was conveniently still having voice troubles which Fox's character shamelessly had to point out to the audience, despite the fact that it was apparently fixed before he spoke at the end of the first movie. Obviously Bumblebee talking through radio segments is more marketable, but doesn't do much for the movie's integrity. For an advanced alien robot soldier he was reduced to a sobbing weakling.<br/><br/>Starscream was also reduced to a sniveling little weasel (like the original cartoon only more so) but I actually preferred the new and improved Starscream from the first recent movie. Still Megatrons bitch but with a bit more dignity.<br/><br/>You could also see bits of Aeon Flux, The Matrix and even Star Wars thrown into this movie which made it even less inspiring to watch. And they paid these two guys 8 mil to rush this script out. An 8th grader could have done it for a six pack and a play boy magazine, and had the excuse of being an 8th grader.<br/><br/>To my huge surprise and disappointment I enjoyed both Star Trek and Terminator Salvation a lot more than this movie. It's a movie I think you would take your little brother or sister to see, but shouldn't expect much. I'd watch it again if I had nothing else to do, but won't go out of my way to see it again."

"soodynem","3","10","23","25 June 2009"," Revenge of Michael Bay on everyone who enjoyed the first one!
","What can I say?<br/><br/>I honestly don't know. Did I like the first one? Well I guess. Although I must admit that I took great joy in one reviewer's description of the Transformers as scrap metal tumbleweeds. This movie, though, takes everything that was bad about the first one and multiplies it by about 1,000,000 and takes all the things that were good about the first one and sort of gets rid of them.<br/><br/>The plot? Well, from what I picked up, it involves digging a machine out of a pyramid and destroying the sun with it, which will somehow make a new energy source for the evil robots. That's basically what this movie leads up to, but that really wouldn't be at the top of your mind while watching the half hour long robot battle at the end. I mean, hell, the battle in The Matrix Revolution had about 240,000 more robots, but you can still tell what's going on a hell of a lot better than you can here. There's a bulldozer, Bumblebee kills it. There's this mechanical wolf thing, someone kills it. Scorponok (from the first movie) comes back for like, 30 seconds, someone kills it. Repeat. Several times. It just drags on and on and on.<br/><br/>There were a few good things though. That SR-71 is actually pretty entertaining, even if he did somehow teleport himself from D.C. to Arizona by beating out some doors. Another thing, there's actually a point to casting Hugo Weaving as Megatron this time, because you can actually tell that it's him. In fact, the voices of all the Transformers sound a lot better.<br/><br/>But, there's more than enough bad to balance it out. There are so many more Transformers here, and all of them are as faceless and nameless as your average Stormtrooper. There's these bikes, who where supposed to be in the first movie, and they get about two minutes of screen time. Why are they here? And how many people above the age of thirteen find two male dogs humping each other, multiple times, funny? And you just got to love the line: ""I'm under the enemy's...scrotum."" Yeah. Hi. Larious. My favorite stupid part in the movie is when Magatron jumps out of the ocean, then, in the next cut, it shows him flying passed Saturn.<br/><br/>There's also these two twin things, one voiced by Tom Kenny, who have a sort of a hit and miss kind of stereotype humor. And they're always around. Are we supposed to care about them? Are we supposed to feel sad when one gets eaten? Are we supposed to feel happy when it reveals that he actually doesn't? These guys are the Jar Jar Binks of this movie! And I actually don't mind Jar Jar Binks all that much! I admit that I had a good laugh when one of them said: ""'Cuz you a pussy!"" to a puny human. Don't ask me why.<br/><br/>If you really, really, really liked the first movie, go ahead and see this. If not? Stay away. Rent it, if you must, but save the majority of your money. And people thought Wolverine was a dumb movie.<br/><br/>Oh, and Michael Bay? Thanks a lot for that nice shot of Jon Turturro's ass. I will never forget it. Ever."

The laughter started the second it started to the very end. And I'm not talking about the laughter from the non stop comic relief the film gives (so much in fact I believe this movie was meant to five years old), but the kind of laughing were something is so awful all you can do is laugh. Everything from the childish written dialogue, racial stereotype twin autobots, human technology stronger than the autobots, non realistic college, and infamous Michael Bay slow- mo shots were absolutely atrocious, disgusting, and off the wall.

"banvard","3","10","23","20 June 2009"," worse than expected
","Yes, it's a Michael Bay film and so to expect anything else than lots of explosions, special effects, cultural ignorance, borderline racism and a big military showreel would be hypocritical. And I'm not going to criticise the plot either, because, clearly the film was not intended to have one. There is just enough dialoge to stitch the various battle scenes together and that's it. Continuity comes down to keeping the same characters throughout the film and having them say variations of their four or five different lines over and over again, and you know what, its fine, because the film doesn't try to be more than that. After all, this is a life action version of a cheap cartoon show inspired by a toy commercial. Hey, Michael Bay would have been my first choice too!<br/><br/>I was getting annoyed by the frequent use of words like ""destiny"" and ""purpose"" and all that, but its not Transformer's fault. Every second Hollywood movie has it by now and I was already tired of it by the time Matrix Reloaded came out.<br/><br/>There is some true potential for comedy here, snappy, fast shot dialogue, and little side stories that are cut together and overlaid in a very fast and exciting fashion. Typical for Michael Bay and something that worked well in movies like Bad Boys II. Too bad they all boil down to some character bumping her head or something, oh well.<br/><br/>What I was expecting were stunning visual effects and a big, thoroughly directed action spectacle and in that respect I felt rather disappointed. Don't get me wrong, I have to give Bay credit for being able to insert an action driven sequence in five minute intervals, and I'm not being cynical! If you love big explosions, there are few films that can reach this sort of action density.<br/><br/>It's fun, but it's also way too uniform. From the first opening battle with some huge unicycle robot to the last fight in the desert there is little or no dramatisation, no structure to keep me interested. <br/><br/>For instance, the robot's agility and strength are in no comparison to the little human soldiers with their petty machineguns, so having humans fight robots for more than 20 minutes without them getting ripped into little fleshy pieces just seems odd and therefore drains a lot of suspense out of the action. <br/><br/>The Explosions are repetitive and especially the final battle seemed to go on forever. The camera feels detached and inconsistent, which is sad because some sequences had some really great camera work in them but they are short moments and are easy to miss.<br/><br/>Even the visual effects on the robots weren't all that impressive. I would have actually liked to see some robots TRANSFORM but even that wasn't possible most of the time. I'm sure a lot of effort has been put in building and animating these characters but apart from two or three scenes none of the transformations can actually be seen!!?! Either the camera swoops around so there's too much motion blur, or it's just a close-up where you can only see some random metal parts fly by, or the shot is cut early, or the transformation is actually purposely hidden behind some cleverly placed obstacle (parachute!!!).<br/><br/>Kudos to the production team, it's a technical masterpiece. Still, despite all the effort, it left me somewhat unsatisfied. I rate it 3 out of ten because, sadly, it's not what I'd consider a great action film. Transformers 3 will probably be better than this but I won't be going."

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a great continuation of the original from 2007. Michael bay has once again created a great ride, but (what a shock) critics did not like the film, since many reviews were more than hostile against the whole thing.<br/><br/>Yes, it is true, the film lacks all the values that critics so much desire. It lacks in character development, the story, well, also the plot has holes. we might say it has a very low critical value. But who cares, most films that critics like are usually so boring that you ask yourself why are you tormenting yourself by watching it, just remember Monster's Ball, Brokeback Mountain and many other films.<br/><br/>Well, Transformers is not this kind of film. It is the opposite. It is a great action ride with childish humor, which actually is not so harmless as it might seem at first sight. It has a few vulgar lines. And because of all this it ads to the mood of the whole film as a positive one. Whether you are a teenager or a grown-up, it does not matter, you will laugh to the jokes, no matter how primitive they are, because they actually work.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is once again the winner. Steve Jablonsky, Linkin Park and many other musicians add to the tempo of the film, which is always at high speed. It never stops.<br/><br/>Visual effects are once again spectacular, explosions are already Bay's trademark, but this time he even surpassed himself by making Transformers 2 one of the most explosive films of the year.<br/><br/>So, if you are a person, who likes to relax in the cinema and wants to have a lot of laughs, and at the same time enjoy in an adventure full of action sequences, then Transformers 2 is the film for you. If you are searching for a film with a plot, a lot of twists and surprises, then you better stay away.<br/><br/>But one is sure, Michael Bay never disappoints, if you are looking for a film that can entertain you, because he is an entertainer and not an artist.<br/><br/>All in all, it is worth to see this film in the cinema on the big screen, because sometimes a light film to relax and enjoy is all you need to relax your brain cells for a while.<br/><br/>-ENTERTAINMENT: 10<br/><br/>-MUSIC: 10<br/><br/>-CRITICAL VALUE: 4 (it does not really matter)<br/><br/>-STORY: 8<br/><br/>-PLOT:7<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>-TOTAL: 9"

","I haven't been tempted to write a review like this since the last Star Wars turkey (which at least I managed to nod off in)This is an excessively long, witless exercise in bombastic overkill. Strangely enough , as many others have commented it manages to be really boring. I took the kids and enjoyed the last one. It was a kind of souped up Kaiju. This one is like the crappy middle period Godzillas. All the Robots are confined to a kind of Monster Island and come out on missions to defeat the bad gut robots. This is doubly tacky because the island is Diego Garcia, stolen from it's people by The Brits with the US. They ar still fighting to get their Island back. IN fact the film is one long hymn to the US military and appears to be some sort of retrospective justification for US intervention in the Middle East. As usual the humour is lame and embarrassing. Shia acts with conviction but must be hoping this is the last. Avoid this at all costs"
"andrew.kay72@btopenworld.com","1","13","32","20 June 2009"," The dullest and most irritating film I've seen in years.
","I saw ""Transformers 2"" yesterday. For some reason, it opened in London before most of the rest of the world. Wow, this was probably the dullest, most stupid and irritating film I've seen in a long time. Like watching paint dry, while being punched in the face at the same time. <br/><br/>Transformers as characters are dull visually, so I'm not sure why they would have made a good movie in the first place. The plot ends up being some symbol-driven Indian Jones quest for something that makes no sense, as does most of the film, which means there's consistency, but not a fun film, at all.<br/><br/>There's the stock shouty sidekick character, a lot of boring explosions and endless minutes of over-sized robots knocking the crap out of each other, which, without any characterisation or plot development is just an exercise in sitting with very expensive computers and having a lot of money to make these things visually interesting, which given the results means that isolating yourself from the screenplay and the rest of the movie, gives the money a fractured feel- between the non-existent plot and the explosion pornography.<br/><br/>If any of it made sense, then the payoff would be somewhat compelling, but this film insults its audience. Nothing wrong with dumb Summer movie, but not so quite stupid and annoying and boring would have helped. Especially, as they added two Transformers that have obviously being hanging around gangs in the ghetto, because they speak so ""street"". Jar Jar Binks, all is forgiven.<br/><br/>The set pieces are boring too, especially as they're made in isolation to any hint of a plot that engages or makes sense. At 150 minutes, it's at least an hour overlong. People may say, ""well, what did you expect?"". <br/><br/>True, I wasn't expecting great things, but, in contrast, I didn't expect something so stupidly dull. I'm sure it'll clear up at the box office, but I'll be looking for Michael Mann's new movie to re-engage my cinematic taste buds. I'm not a film snob, but ""Transformers 2"" upset my sensibilities and didn't entertain. I'm sure it'll make a bundle... which is a pretty sad state of affairs for movies for the future."

","I really say that a lot, but Hollywood just keep em coming: worst sequel ever. <br/><br/>While the first ""Transformers"" at least delivered some intentional entertainment, this one was more of a Gangland (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0265198/) experience. Plot? Well... basically none, but they put some pyramids in it in the end, maybe to make it look mystical or to find a connection to the desert stuff from the first movie. The whole storyline develops around cuts between ultimate-hardcore robot-fights and some body shots on Megan Fox - which really would be sufficient for a lovely evening, but somehow it just doesn't work this time... maybe because everything's just toooooooo chaotic. Like attending a meeting of a dadaist work group without being invited or having an idea what dadaism means. You are guided through an hectic and unsteady series of fights, without any climax at all. Maybe it's really just to much action for a movie of that length, but even the end-fight failed to stand out or deliver - just another fight in a row. <br/><br/>Acting was... decent. Shia LaBeouf will never become my favorite after what he did to Indie. The role of Megan Fox was stripped down to look good and to ask Shia LaBeouf whether he loves her. The Parents? Ridiculous. Everybody else can be sure not to win the Oscar for best supporting role neither. <br/><br/>Let's get to the positive aspects: visual artists did a wonderful job, as did the sound artists. All of the Post-Production should be awarded and guaranteed that they never ever have to work for Micheal Bay again. Hollywood has other directors that acknowledge visual effects to that extend without completely waiving the storyline."

Meanwhile the Autobots are battling the Decepticons with the help of human forces. However, the president's man is unconvinced, and wonder if the Decepticons are on Earth only to hunt the Autobots. And that maybe it would be better if the Autobots leave Earth and lead the Decepticons to follow them.<br/><br/>It's good that both Shia and Megan Fox return as well as many of the others. The action is still over the top extravaganza. There're a few too many slow motion for my taste. I'd rather it speed by, and maintain the pace rather than sit there and gawk. But if you like the first one, the second one will give you more of the same. The big thing I don't like is that the Bots seems to be still kept a secret.

"jbloomer-1","10","7","15","25 June 2009"," Clueless Critics - Or Decepticons in Disguise?
","This is just another classic case of the critics having no clue. So much of this movie ties in to the story lines originally set in place by both the original TV series as well as the animated movie. The writers knew their material, but the critics are sorely lacking in that arena (or do they have a different agenda?).<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: Here's a little secret that a lot of people may not immediately pick up on. This movie, though very subtle as it may be, casts President Obama in a bad light. The main political hack trying to pull the plug on our military working with the Autobots against the Decepticon threat is working with the direct authorization of President Obama, who is named specifically during a news broadcast being watched in a military bunker.<br/><br/>This political liaison working for the President is portrayed as a sniveling coward that is dealt with quite efficiently by our men in uniform, and that goes against the grain of the real world's left-leaning media. Hollywood in general, as well as a large cross-section of our mainstream media are already well-known lapdogs of Obama, so anything that puts him in a bad light is going to immediately receive their disdain. END SPOILER ALERT.<br/><br/>Unfortunate political statements aside, this movie dovetails perfectly with the first one and even outperforms it. Granted, there are some minor plot elements that are predictable in the movie, but the writers still keep you guessing. No single character's existence is guaranteed nor implied by story lines originated in the TV series, but there are plenty of nods along the way.<br/><br/>As with most action movies, ignore the critics. Take your whole family (children over 10 is recommended due to some of the sexual innuendo, plus the majority of the movie is over the heads of most kids under that age anyway) and enjoy the adventure. Besides, it's not a Cannes art film. It's a TRANSFORMERS movie!"

","I got to be part of the first screening in the world showing the final cut and I thought that would be brilliant however I was not expecting to be the first person in the world to witness a highly anticipated failure. This was the general concensus when talking to people after the movie. The start of the movie seemed to show the same elements from the first one such as the comedy within the family which was good however as the film goes on the comedy can almost be described as slap stick. In fact it is the very over used comedy but stopped me from actually being bored by the action ironically.<br/><br/>The movie is very long and the explosions were amazing but at one point I wanted them just to sit down and start talking. I felt that the movie became more of an indiana jones movie which ironically they went to the same location as the third Indiana Jones which was probably some Spielberg influence. The performances was good however, their were some awkward Shia performances which you will see when u view the movie. Megan Fox as always was looking amazing, but her character was very much under used and her role became more of a photo shoot with Micheal Bay using camera angles to highlight her beauty which is not that bad but does not make the movie that great. Again I'm trying to justify to you why I thought this blockbuster was such a disappointment.<br/><br/>The story felt like it was made up on the spot. As if the writers were winging it and therefore made the whole film feel ridiculous. I felt the story did not have to be so complicated and would have been much better if made simpilar. The dialogue throughout the movie was very hard to hear and this was reinforced by this same statement being said by many of those at the premiere.<br/><br/>One man said at the end of the movie that ""thank god it was CGI based movie because otherwise it would have nothing going for it."" I do hope you do see it in the cinema because I do not believe this movie should be seen any other way, but I was surprised that at points of the movie that my eyes glazed over because of how boring some scenes were. At points I could not believe some scenes were happening.<br/><br/>Anyway this my opinion let me know what u think of the movie.<br/><br/>Anthony"

"BretSmith360","1","8","18","24 June 2009"," So BAD! But Not too bad. SPIOILERS!!!
","Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was the first movie I saw so far this summer, I'm not off to a good start. If you've seen the trailer you can pretty much guess what you're going to be looking at for a good two and half hours. And I say looking at, because for me I felt I wasn't watching a movie. I was just looking at stuff going on. Anyway I guess I should talk about the ""plot"" <br/><br/>The film starts in China with an anonymous Decepticon fighting a bunch of anonymous auto bots . Now this action is interesting because it's hard to tell who you should root for, because you can tell who is who or what is what. All the Transformers are new to this film, and they're all that gray metallic color. The close ups and unsteady camera is one of the problems I and many other people had with the first film. I was also hoping it would be rectified in this film, I guess not. In fact this time around the close ups and shaky cameras are even worse. So basically the first scene looks like a video of how cars are factory built in fast forward, with bad lighting, and transforming sound effects. Eventually Optimus Prime gets ready to join the fight. This is the part where my excitement builds. ""Allright somebody I know is going to fight!"", I said to myself. The way Prime enters the fight was pretty cool. He's seen in an airplane in truck form and drive out of the plane transforming to his robot mode while falling. While falling he release parachutes from his back to help safely land....Goofy. Huh? Anyway he starts fighting with The anonymous Deception. It was a horrible fight, It looks like a PS2 cut-scene. Yeah the CGI was pretty lame the entire movie. After beating the Deception Optimums learns about the fallen.<br/><br/>After all that we cut to Sam and his family. Sam is now in college and before leaving he touches a small remain of the all-spark., Which was used to destroy Megatron in the first movie. After touching it Sam is implanted with knowledge of the whereabouts of something that the Decepticon's need to conquer the planet.... or something. Now most of the scenes that have humans characters will have some sort of lame juvenile joke attached to it. While watching this movie you can play a game I like to call, ""Count the Lame teenager jokes and visual gags Game!"" While playing this game I lost count several times. In this movie I saw dogs humping dogs, robots humping (the very sexy and my dream fantasy girlfriend) Megan Fox's leg, Decepticon Balls, Robot's farting Parachutes, Robots talking about pubic hairs. and a guy Tasering his nuts. Yeah... If you thought the masturbation conversation from the first was awful, then boy are in for a treat. <br/><br/>So Sam goes to college goes nuts, write symbols all over the place, refuses to help the auto bots, get's kid napped by Decepticons, rescued by auto bots, and witness the death of Optimas Prime. Now the death scene had the potential to be really emotional. But ultimately it wasn't sad for me at all. Now if you seen this movie you might think I'm being cold and insensitive. But the build up to his death didn't work at all, I like Prime a lot but his death wasn't satisfying at all. Not to mention he comes back anyway. Also the trailer pretty much told us he would die when Sam Screams, ""Optimus!"" in it that was a pretty clear indication for everyone. The death in the 1986 film was way better that's how prime should go out one on one against Megatrton, ""One shall stand, One shall fall!"" <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is pretty much nothing. Sam and Friends get zapped to Egypt thanks to an old Decepticon who recently switched to the Autobot side(I actually really liked that character), They Search for the Matrix of Leadership, They find it, Get caught in a 20 minute robot battle, then Sam dies. Let me talk about this scene. When Sam dies he goes to heaven or something. He talks with the dead Autobot leaders(Which look more like Lego Bionicle more than transformers.) and they bring him back to life. Soooo Stupid!!! However I did get a pretty good laugh from this scene. Sam comes back to life and gives Prime the Matrix and for once a pretty cool fight occurs. Optimus Fighting the Fallen and Megatron at once. it was pretty cool.<br/><br/>This movie never really picks up. It accomplishes nothing, it introduces a million new Transformers that don't do anything or contributed in anyway, but if you want something nice to look for 2.5 hours go see it. Even though this movie sucked I'm really excited for the third movie. Maybe since all the boring crap and exposition in these films has been covered perhaps the third movie will have a decent plot. Oh and before I end let me say how much I hate what they've done with Soundwave. First of all he's not in it for long(He spends the entire film in space raping a satellite). second He's not a tape deck. What the hell? Although I'm glad they got Frank Welker to do the voice again. Now, this review mostly focused on what I dislike heres a list of what i did like.<br/><br/>I liked Megatron and Starscream relation, Devistator (for the most part) Bumble Bee's Fight towards the end, Primes Fight against the Fallen, Ravage, The Matrix, The Old Decepticon, The Soundtrack, Megan Fox"
"rsj624","1","9","21","12 December 2013"," Easily the Worst Movie Ever made
","--WARNING: There are some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--<br/><br/>I Don't make such a statement everyday, you know... ""Worst Movie Ever"". Actually I usually give most films quite the chance while watching them before condemning it to my never watch again list. I've probably considered only a handful to ever be so bad that I actually want to wish them away forever over winning the lottery or owning a Delorean, and this is one of them.<br/><br/>Now to be fair, the first Transformers film was a half way decent movie that I not only own, but have watched more than once. This film however, was a birthday gift from a friend, and I wish they gave us those hours of torment back after we actually managed to sit through the whole atrocity. Where to start? <br/><br/>For one thing there was no originality to the plot whatsoever, this however is to be expected, and is normally expected of most summer movie sequels nowadays, but this movie was the first to just go all out in managing to have nothing, and I mean nothing redeeming about its aggressively horrible existence. The parents of Sam, the main character played by Shia LaBeouff, who granted weren't the most serious of individuals in the first film, have been beyond watered down to the court jester's court jester standard, and the constant need to have some transformers use juvenile dialog made it clear that this movie was not thought for one second to be developed as a serious film. <br/><br/>The saddest part however is just how seriously it actually takes itself. For one thing, you don't spend millions of dollars on special effects in a movie if you're not taking it seriously, and this movie not only went for broke with the CGI, but there is so much going on during the films action sequences that it is near impossible to tell exactly what is going on. It just seemed like sparks and shrapnel flying everywhere, and the occasional epic angle used to emphasize the size and scope of an event...speaking of epic angles, I have a hard time remembering a scene in which Megan Fox wasn't running/moving/existing in slow motion, as if the writers of Baywatch worked on her part of the script and they had no clue what to do with her character in any verbal or intellectual sense.<br/><br/>The plot twists are something that not even the newest of movie goers could serious fall for, and it's almost insulting to any real fan of transformers to watch this movie just take everything that made the first movie interesting and basically decide that it was in the way. You really expect us to believe that you would kill Optimus Prime? This isn't 24. Also, apparently a giant robot urinating on a cast member is seen as quality entertainment over, oh I don't know, a new romantic story arch between Sam and Makayla maybe, or even an origin story would've been appreciated (hopefully that doesn't inspire anyone).<br/><br/>This movie single-handedly ended my experience for going to the movies during summertime the year it came out. It took literally years for my faith to be restored in summer movies before I was able to muster up the belief that whatever film I picked would never be as bad as this one. <br/><br/>Do yourself a huge favor and watch a B-rated film instead, even mystery science theater films are better...without the riff-tracking. Avoid this movie, or for that matter anything after the first Transformers film unless you really... really... really enjoyed it."

","I am going to start by admitting that I am a movie snob.I'm not easily pleased,nor impressed by what comes out nowadays yet I learned to adapt and appreciate this novelty genre namely ""summer blockbuster"",this sweet cancer rotting within the film-making industry,this symbiosis of sense-pleasing and brain-shrinking relish known also through the overused term ""pure entertainment"".Which is nothing but an excuse that protectively envelops the money-sucking tentacles of Hollywood.<br/><br/>In view of the recent acclaimed comic/toy/cartoon films that conspicuously invaded the industry during the last of this sinful seasons,one may believe that after the consecutive critical and financial hits they finally got the right recipe to create the equivalent of a cinematic aphrodisiac.And they did,for a brief period climaxing with ""The Dark Knight"",the very moment when the two pedestals of money and acclaim reached a microscopical equilibrium on the balance of success.Notwithstanding, ""Transformers:Revenge of The Fallen"" is the epitome of the downfall of that trend;a downfall which I hope that won't victimize the average moviegoers for an extended period of time,and will be quickly followed by a gradual evolution.<br/><br/>I walked into the theater expecting the safe formula that worked so well for the first ""Transformers"",which happened to be exactly the perfect blend of Hollywood's finest qualities used as an excuse for product placement.I left the theater virtually insulted by Michael Bay's effort of not letting us enjoy the mindless fun.The elements which compose ""fun"" alike ""TF1"",""Crank"",""Live Free or Die Hard"" are in abundance,unfortunately so are those that make up ""mindless"".There is no antagony between those two indistinct features of the movie,just the overwhelming and ostentatious quantity of both which leisurely prevented me from focusing on the first one while drinking my soda and stuffing popcorn in my mouth.<br/><br/>A plot as smooth,clear and flat as a piece of Emmentaler (with an approximately equal amount of holes),a cast consisting of bankable,mediocre,overacting future-Christian Bales and teen-pleasing tediously artificial wannabe Angelina Jolies,a script as bewilderingly original and witty as the verses in Jonas Brothers' latest singles make up this simplistic and painfully elongated CGI extravanganza.It's the symbol of Hollwyood's worst,so obtrusive that ends up achieving an anecdotal value.<br/><br/>There is one unforgettable flaw of this movie,obnoxious even beyond the blatant butchering of geography,army policy and organization,pointlessness of major characters (would someone kindly explain to me what was the outcome of the presence of Leo,the parents,the small blue robot,and the annoying government guy to the the plot ?) and awfully overdone premise,is the ""humor"".Or at least the complete and utter failed attempt at comic relief through repetitive perverted innuendos and low-brow racist teenage stereotypes which develop into an unbearable trend throughout the film.Mechanoid testicles ? Gangsta robots ? John Turturro's thong ? Mother getting high on pot ? Those are the clear signs that the divine hand of Steven Spielberg lost his grip on the project during the production of this predictable two-hours and a half hip-hop car commercial.<br/><br/>Technologically speaking,this movie is a breakthrough in computer generated graphics and sound editing/mixing.Few scene in particular almost made me forget about the total artistic kitsch and enjoy magnificent backgrounds and character rendering at least for a few minutes.The cinematography is the sole improvement over the first ""Transformers"",with less shaky cam and more slow-motion to enhance the eyecandyness of the explosions within IMAX shots (which are surprisingly rare given the insane budget).Unfortunately,the movie fails on so many levels that technical brilliance alone cannot embody a redeeming factor.<br/><br/>""Beginning, middle, end,"" Agent Simmons pleads to Jetfire. ""Details. Plot. Compress.

"Willie-12","3","9","21","26 June 2009"," The Very Definition Of Excessive Self Indulgence
","While watching Transformers 2, I could almost picture it in my mind. I could see Michael Bay, sitting in the editing room, mesmerized by all the footage that was shot, coupled with the mind-blowing special effects mixed in, overwhelmed by it all. I could almost hear his very thoughts at that moment: ""I can't let any of this go."" And so he didn't. Which means that what ended up on screen was the result of his inability to let a story be the guiding factor, and allowing his self indulgence to take over. All of that put together equals this: a nuclear explosion of unbelievable eye candy with almost no sign of a coherent storyline. It also equaled a movie that was, at the very least, 30 minutes too long. Very disappointing. I guess, though, that I'm to blame just as much as anyone else. I dropped 10 bucks down the drain faster than you can say Megatron. And by doing that, I guess I provided the justification that Bay needed for this sub-par mess. The idea that, as long as it looks neat, and things blow up real good, then that's all that matters. No doubt this movie will make millions upon millions. It may even reach the billion dollar range. But that doesn't make it o.k., and it doesn't make it a good movie. Heck, it doesn't even make it a decent movie. And I hope Bay will realize that. Because if he doesn't, then we can all expect to see it again in the third installment. And that will be the real shame. But as I have said before, that's just my opinion."

","This movie, save for its grand special effects, was simply terrible. I decided to see this movie on a whim after seeing the first Transformers, which was overall a little above mediocre. The movie started off OK, with some great special effect sequences and some comical scenes that warranted a chuckle or two, combined with subpar acting. This movie was very unbelievable, even in the normal life scenes. From the very beginning lack of decent character development and feeble writing really brought this down, with lack of a coherent and interesting storyline. There were some very ""epic"" battle scenes that made the whole experience somewhat worthwhile. This movie lacks in any real intelligence, and it shows how limited and dumb the American world view can be and how mindless action and sex sell. The funniest part of this movie was when Shia Lebeouf's character died, as all the melodrama that tried to set a sad mood kept my friends and I laughing nonstop. At many moments during the movie I felt like walking out of the theater because I was so bored and could not pay attention to the movie. Not to be recommended, maybe deserving for a rental if you want to see mindblowing special effects, which truly were some of the best I had ever seen and broke down the barrier between what looks computer generated and what looks real."

","I was a fan of the first film. It was decent for what it was about; transforming robots. Not a big fan of the original cartoons but I loved playing with the toys growing up. So my buddy and I went to catch this film opening night, and we walked out of there feeling like our lives had been deprived, as in we wanted not only our money back but our time we lost seeing the film.<br/><br/>It follows the same basic formula the first one did; you got the transforming robots, hot girls, an O.K. cast, lots of explosions, but this one failed whereas the first one pulled it off. For starters, I laughed just a couple of times throughout the movie. O.K. so it wasn't meant to be a comedy, I'll keep watching for redeeming qualities. They never came. It was like watching Terminator Salvation all over again where it was the most unrealistic (and I'm not talking about transforming robots that fight unrealistic) movie I've ever seen. I expected this. The first film was unrealistic. However, at least they got some of the military stuff right which in this movie it's just all wrong wrong wrong.<br/><br/>Then there's the plot development, or the lack thereof. Again, it's a Michael Bay vehicle I more than expected this. However, I didn't expect a COMPLETE lack of plot. It's as though literally the explosions came first and what there was of story was thought of on the spot as dubbing for the transformers. It was kiddish (again, Transformers, but more so than the first) it was filled with dumb dialogue from both autobots and decepticons, and it made me angry is what it did. I don't walk out of movies feeling like that; they don't get to me, but this one was just so horrendously bad that I couldn't help but feel mad I had to sit through it.<br/><br/>You know there are people who loved it in there and they clapped, good for them. Just means that if this film succeeds Hollywood is going to again insult the movie going intelligence in order to make their millions. This is O.K. I'm all for making money, but also there's supply and demand, and I really hope demand for a third film is so low they'll just save their money and make something else. That's my dream, don't think it'll happen like that though."

","Being a massive Transformers fan I couldn't wait for the 2nd movie. Yes the first film didn't have any robot character development etc, but was a OK introduction... but unfortunately Revenge of the fallen is more or less the same again.<br/><br/>For me this movie fails because there is almost no dialogue between the transformers themselves and no character development. With a few exceptions the robots don't talk to each other enough and I am fed up of the laziness when there are several Transformers on screen. After Primes ""death"" the autobots literally ""park up"" in car form and its the humans that talk around them. Why aren't they all in robot form discussing it? If this film was to be a success with the Fans it needed to be made as the cartoons/80's movie were, with Transformers being main characters and the humans with very small parts. The main story and conversation should be around the transformers themselves not Sam or colleague room mates etc.<br/><br/>So many transformers were new to the movie and not explained. Who were the decepticons that arrived for the end battle? Apart from the awful twins characters, we didn't get to know the new autobots? Bay has ruined this for the true fans."

","Michael Bay must have loved smashing his Tonka trucks into each other as a child. And he hasn't progressed far since. His teaming up with Spielberg only further exaggerates the film's ridiculous effects. The first movie... okay. It had half a story line and was somewhat charming and easy to follow. Sadly, the the title to this film does not do the film any justice. Aside from the two candy-tart girls who brought the sex appeal, this movie is filled to the brim with ethnic stereotypes, cheap-shock humour, unbelievable events, and most of all, too many robots smashing into one another. You can make a brilliant film for $40 million or less, so why waste so much on this failure? Some might say that the story couldn't be handled any other way, and that if you don't want to see action and be entertained, then don't go and see it. It's just a shame that movies with thrilling plots and characters and real issues seem to be pushed aside and collect dust, while mindless robots trudge into the theatre in an orderly fashion to be 'entertained'."
"PWNYCNY","1","18","50","26 June 2009"," Pull the plug on this pathetic, pretentious hunk of junk.
","This movie is so awful, so devoid of anything that even remotely resembles a work of art that one can reasonably conclude that the director was instructed to sacrifice any vestige of artistic quality in order to make a quick buck. There can be no other credible explanation for why this weird cartoon/live action concoction was made in the first place. The producers of this movie must have gotten together and decided that they will make a movie suitable for a four-year-old but advertise it as a PG-13 movie and thus sucker in adults to watch this incredible cinematic mess. In fact, this film is so bad that no child should be made to have to watch this cacophony of noise. There are enough problems in this world that we do not need to add a movie that shows machines behaving like people and so-on-and-so-forth. <br/><br/>Sometimes a movie is bad because of poor directing, sometimes because of poor acting, sometimes because of a poor script, sometimes because of poor cinematography and sometimes because of other creative factor. This movie combines the worst features of all the categories mentioned. This movie, which is part cartoon and part live action, seems determined to delete or play down anything that even remotely resembles a coherent and intellectually stimulating plot. The fundamentally infantile plot is overshadowed only by the gratuitous use of special effects that are so cartoon-like that it makes one wonder why this movie even bothered to use actors at all. But what ultimately destroys this movie as a quality work of art is a ponderous, pedestrian, witless and implausible plot that asks the audience to root for or at least care about machines, big, noisy, ugly, clanking, machines, which is definitely stretching literary license to the limit. A machine is ... a machine and to invest it with human qualities is an untenable concept that is bound to destroy the plausibility of any story and this movie is no exception. This would be like having the USS Enterprise become one of the characters in Star Trek or a tank or aircraft carrier having something to say in a war movie. But that is what this movie asks the audience to accept, and it does not work because it cannot work. Machines fighting ... settling grudges ... discussing issues of good vs. bad ... ugh! Now, the movie does make an intriguing attempt to mimic the opening scenes from 2001 A Space Odyssey, but quickly slides back to a level of intellectual sophistication appropriate for a child - a very young, preliterate child. It is as if the director had no confidence in the screenwriter or lost confidence in the power of cinema to actually tell a literate story, and instead opted to fill the movie with ridiculous special effects a la the recent remake of King Kong with its plethora of incredibly hysterical special effects that reduced THAT movie to the level of a cinematic joke. Indeed, this movie might have worked better if King Kong HAD made a cameo appearance and duked it out with one of the bad guy machines. King Kong vs. The Machines. But that's another story. This movie is so devoid of intellectual content that it makes one of Michael Bay's other movies, Pearl Harbor, seem like a first-class production of Shakespeare. Enough already. Just pull the plug on this noisy, pretentious, ludicrous, inane, boring, and decidedly obtuse clunker. Or better yet, just take it out of circulation and stick it in the junk yard with all the other rusting and worthless pieces of junk."

","If I were in a certain target audience, say, 10-12 years old with ADD, ""Transformers 2"" would be a great movie. It has everything: Explosions! Robots fighting robots (and they're robots in disguise)! Cool cars! Hot chicks! Numerous jokes about testicles! <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I'm not in this demographic and found ""Transformers 2"" to be probably the worst movie I've seen in years. From horrible, clichéd writing to confusing special effects to incessant explosions, this movie was 2 ½ hours of noise, blunder and bluster. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the first movie, mostly due to the charisma of Shia Lebouf, as Sam Witwicky, and the over-the- top-performance of John Turturro as Agent Simmons. In addition, Megan Fox was exactly as her surname implies and the action was impressive, although a bit hard to follow. Michael Bay and the script writers clearly believe that more is better and throw so much at the audience in the sequel that the only outcome is vomit-inducing nausea, confusion and unintentional hilarity. <br/><br/>The story bounces around constantly and throws in pointless snippets, such as when Mrs. Witwicky eats marijuana-laced brownies while visiting Sam (Shia Lebouf) at college. This serves no purpose whatsoever other than for cheap, juvenile laughs. Another glaring example is when Sam escapes the clutches of a cute, anorexic freshman who turns out to be a Decepticon. After Sam eludes her once, she completely drops out of the story. If the evil robots could appear as humans, wouldn't they have taken over the world by now? <br/><br/>Taking a cue from George Lucas and Jar Jar Binks, this movie introduces several new, highly irritating and completely extraneous characters, such as Sam's roommate Leo Spitz or new Transfomers, ""The Twins."" The latter are stereotypes of the worst kind and are clearly based on an icon of self-parody, Flavor Flav. I'm just surprised they weren't called Step and Fetch It! <br/><br/>Probably the main reason I hated this film though is due to its cost. With a budget higher than what the state of Wyoming spends in a fiscal year, this movie attempts to make up for logic and smarts with juvenile humor, special effects and military hardware. I guess if you can't convince them with intelligence, confuse them with BS! <br/><br/>Finally, does anyone else think the character of General Morshower (ironically played by Glenn Morshower) looks like comedian Jim Gaffigan? I couldn't stop giggling every time the General appeared on-screen. How apropos for this movie."

","I was horribly bored one night with my girlfriend out of town, my friends all at work, and nothing else to do but sit around my apartment and drink, so I decided I'd instead go see a movie, but the only one I was even remotely interested in seeing, tragically, was Transformers 2.<br/><br/>The first Transformers was a slightly confusing, often annoying, and thoroughly overblown shiny toy commercial that was upgraded into a shiny car commercial, because let's face it, product placement is everything, with a somewhat silly, but at least cohesive story. Shia Lebouf was annoying, Megan Fox was hot, the robot action was gritty, though a bit confusing because the camera angles always seemed to by just a few degrees off center, which is difficult to do when you consider they're using bloody computers to make this film, and whatever depth the movie might have had was sucked out by a horrific soundtrack, annoying characters, and the slight undertone of racism when Jazz, the black transformer, died at the end.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 took all of the faults of the first movie, put them in a can, and rattled them around for a while, then added more and dumped it out onto the screen. The action scenes seem to take place on a camera that's being swung around by an epileptic monkey, and while the visual effects are impressive, they're somewhat diminished by the fact that you can't tell what the HELL is going on. Even in hi def, the robots all look the same but for the accessories pasted to their robot bodies, and the story is so disjointed it reeks of multiple writers that didn't even consult each other when putting the script together. Apparently there's this guy, the Fallen, the original Decepticon, and everyone who picks up on the vaguely religious aspect, congratulations, now go change your diaper. Anyway, this Fallen is the secret leader, he's looking for energon, and the only place to get it, apparently, is by blowing up the sun with a big secret machine buried in the pyramids of Egypt. I guess a sufficiently advanced race of aliens can only power themselves slightly better than a kid with two photovoltaic cells in a science fair. Anyway, Shia Lebouf returns, only more annoying than ever. But apparently he wasn't annoying enough so they tacked on a pair of 'Ghetto bots' that are like a pair of Jar-Jar's made of metal that continue to raise the undertones of racism to new lows. I know that's contradictory, and I don't care. Megan Fox also returns, the true highlight of the movie, because she's the hottest piece of (actress) this side of a young unviolated Angelina Jolie. In fact she's so hot, even the robots are humping her in this movie, which makes me think the script really was written by eight different thirteen year olds. This movie takes us around the world, introduces a bunch of new characters, then kills them off (except for the Ghetto bots, and that might be borderline racist to some, but honestly, they're so bad, I think it's racist NOT to kill them and bring Jazz back to life with an improbable plot device of some kind, and there's no shortage of those.)<br/><br/>Even though I beat relentlessly on this movie, there were parts that were fun... for a while. But the end is so needlessly drawn out I was genuinely looking at my watch two hours into the film wondering why we hadn't even approached a conclusion yet, and how much longer we had to wait for them to bring Optimus back to bloody life and save the bloody day so the bloody bad robots (who seem to have legions at their command, yet keep losing badly) can go away at last. Drawn out battle scenes only work at a certain level of tension, but the longer it goes on, your adrenaline burns out, you crash, and wonder why you should even give two Shia's about the outcome. But then, Michael Bay probably just needs some Ritalyn and everything will be fine."

I'm in the Air Force myself, I want to gain rank like that.<br/><br/>#4-The humans really played no big part in this movie, it was all about the robots.

'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' was just a plain, horrid mess.<br/><br/>I have to give it kudos for its homage only to the 2007 movie: continual product placement, enormously bad and juvenile humor and robot battle scenes where you can't tell the good from the bad. The best they did to improve was voiding Sam's (LaBeouf) insistent need to repeat the same word 7x, such as ""no,no,no,no,no,no,no""<br/><br/>I had extremely low expectations for this movie after (the insult to the original source material) 2007's version, so I figured I might actually like it. And it wasn't 100% bad: some battle scenes were good and I've seen worse, but yeah it was trash, all the same. As for some people/critics ripping on the ""racial"" stereotypes, I have one comment: they weren't bad due to the bigotry, they were bad because they were simply horribly created (CGI,) had awful lines and too 'Jar-Jar'ish. That should be insult to any race, creed or human enough.<br/><br/>We're given absolutely no script, no direction, scenes that are completely incoherent from the previous, painful dialogue and so-called ""touching"" scenes, flat-out lies (it is told that multiple Autobots came to Earth, yet, there's probably a grand total of 6 on Earth, not much more from the 2007 version,) comical acting – trust me, I was laughing out loud when we're supposed to believe Mikaela (Megan) was scared, clichés from here to Cybertron, enough swearing and partial (male) nudity for an R-rating and roughly 45 minutes that could've been easily cut – the movie went on longer than it took Frodo to ditch the ring.<br/><br/>You'd think with all the dumbed down gags it was meant for the younger, naïve crowd, but they up'd the ante from 2007's masturbation-talk scene to include numerous sexual references (robodog humping Mikaela) and even roboballs. Those and all other jokes fall flat and make me wish I was 4 again so I could've enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Weakly, they reintroduce Sam by a fragment of the All-Spark and now a resurrected Megatron needs it to, oh, I can't remember (or care) why and I just watched it.

","I was going to the sequel to Transformers with very high expectation, namely: expecting to come out not simply amazed by the special effects, but also inspired by the idea of noble robots protecting what's right. Did that happen? Well, in part yes. What I liked about the movie is the basic fable of it. However the way the movie was shoot leaves it way behind the original Transformers. Here's what I did not like: - too much robots, making everything look like a huge mess - too big robots - too fast action sequences, which look like a bunch of robots squezed together, like a giant robot taking whole screen; which make you wonder: ""what has just happened?!"" - too complex robots, that won't allow me to grasp the ""coolness"" - soulless new robot characters (eg: the twins, new guy, etc) - areas that should've been left alone (eg: cyborgs) - flat humor<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is mediocre. Don't mix is with bad, because it's not. It simply lacks ""soul"", lacks the warmth of the first part, lacks the nobility, the greatness. It's hard to describe a movie without a soul, you just feel that it's not there.<br/><br/>It's worth going to the movies to see, but that's about it. And to Mr. Bay I got this to say: don't try to capitalise on the success of the original Transformers, because a sequel doesn't have to follow the ""same times 2"" formula. Make the 3rd Transformers it's own movie, don't repeat, don't rush, don't multiply robots. Less is more."

","If you're a smart movie goer and want something with big explosions and a good amount of tension to turn your brain off to, see Terminator Salvation, because this one isn't redeeming enough to spend 8 dollars on. Terminator sucked in its own right, but at least it had one interesting character. Let me explain.<br/><br/>Michael Bay takes a lot of flack from so-called ""haters"" these days, and with good reason. You either love or hate the first Transformers movie, right? Well, I didn't love or hate it. I thought it was good for an escapist action flick. It had decent enough characters and a plot that you could follow, even if you didn't think some of the humor worked or thought that Megan Fox was just there as eye candy. Well, the same can be said of Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, except for the fact that almost nothing works in this film like it does in the first.<br/><br/>Megan Fox is exploited more, there's more sex humor that's supposed to make us giggle, there are annoying robots that fist bump and act like offensive black stereotypes from ten years ago as if a KKK member wrote the script, there are robots that act and sound like gremlins, there are pointless characters that are there only to shout out terrible one liners, there are random explosions (see: aircraft carrier exploding for ten minutes in unconvincing CGI) there are even giant testicles on one of the Transformers and these are described as ""the enemy scrotum."" That's a direct quote. It's mildly funny in an immature, tongue in cheek kind of way, but it makes a mockery of the Transformers franchise, and that's how most of the film comes off.<br/><br/>We spend the majority of the film following Shia Labeouf and the US military around while they search for, guess what, another mysterious source of power that the Decepticons want. But let's face it, if you want to see this movie, you're not seeing it for plot, you're seeing it for the explosions, basically the eye candy. I can understand that, but the problem is that 75% of the movie is flat-out annoying.<br/><br/>The slapstick humor is too over the top and a lot of the jokes are out of place. There's even a scene in which Shia's mom eats a pot browny and tackles a college student playing frisbee. The point? There isn't one. It's one of the things that hampers this film throughout and it all stems from an incredibly sloppy script. The tone is disjointed and it often can't figure out if it's supposed to be an intense action movie or a fratboy's film made for his twelve year old brother who still thinks fart jokes are hilarious. (There are at least two obvious fart jokes, probably more).<br/><br/>The robots look good in most scenes, but the effects are strangely not up to par with the first film at times. It seemed sometimes like the effects team had a hard time keeping the framerate right during the big robot fighting scenes. It's not a big problem, because it's gorgeous for the most part, but there are really only two glorious fight scenes and they're very far apart in this two and a half hour film that could have been cut in half if the writers knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>This is definitely one of those films that you either love or hate, and it's all going to bank on whether or not you can sit through the annoying over-the-top humor to get to the effects. Syd Field described movies like this as ""characters running from special effects"" so that the effects become the plot and character loses out. He's right on, but the biggest problem here is, as I've already said, the annoying humor and the sometimes cutesy cartoonish robots that don't really have any place tonally or plot-wise. I guess the humor is supposed to somehow hold the film together, but it doesn't even come close.<br/><br/>The script needed an overhaul, but it obviously never got one, and it all feels very thrown together and unpolished for the sake of cash. My advise is, if you LOVED the first movie, rent this one, because there's not enough here to redeem the flaws. The only robots from the first movie are Optimus Prime (who barely has any screen time) and Bumblebee (who spends most of his time in the background as a car), so you can't even rely on an expansion of those characters. <br/><br/>The only other positive thing I have to say about this film is we really get to see how much of a serious threat the Decepticons are. The good guys are always outnumbered, and the Autobots are essentially absent, which is strange since it's supposed to be a war of robots vs. robots, not humans vs. Decepticons. But it does make the war seem desperate, even if it makes the Autobots seem relatively useless without Optimus around to ninja-slash his way through anyone in his way.<br/><br/>3/10. Again, rent this one or see it in a dollar theater when you can. There are better turn- your-brain-off movies out there right now with their own flaws that you don't have to put up with for two and a half painful hours."

","I really thought that after the last movie he would have actually watched transformers and maybe read some of the comics, but it seems not. This film should be called ""Transformers: Alternate reality"" because it is not how it should be.<br/><br/>Lets just look at some things here... (MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS)<br/><br/>The matrix - Wrong shape, wrong purpose, just no. The cube - wtf was that in the first place..? Megatron calling someone master? HA! Also agent smith as megatron... jeez.<br/><br/>Also... I noticed that demolishor was killed in the beginning of the film, yet somehow he managed to come back to life to help form devastator.. Speaking of reborn transformers, bonecrusher? He must have got a new head... And looking at the cast list... Jazz, Frenzy, Barricade? WTF. I didn't see them... <br/><br/>Mudflap and Skids, well some people would have liked them but all I saw in them was that they were the token black transformers seeing as jazz had no lines. <br/><br/>The actual transformers weren't too bad, with the addition of jolt and sideswipe (or Stabby McWheelyfeet -TF2005 XD). Starscream was a lot better, with more lines and a lot more accurate to his persona. Devastator was confusing, i must have counted at least 9 constructicons through the film (1 of which was killed by optimus, 1 to revive megatron) he's made up of 5 i think, but by the time he'd formed i swear i counted about 9 constructicons.. Also there was a lot of incontinuity with Optimus' look at the end. Soundwave was one of the only ones that stuck out in my head, as well as starscream. <br/><br/>To break this movie down simply:<br/><br/>Bay film=Explosions etc... TF storyline completely messed up. Poorly written script. Only slightly better than the 1st one for the fact that the action sequences had longer angles and you could actually see what was happening.<br/><br/>If you are a child that likes action movies, explosions, and have never watched an episode of transformers made before 2000 then get your parents to take you, its worth the free popcorn.<br/><br/>If you are a real die-hard transformers fan, watch a bootleg. It'll avoid the disappointment and regret of paying to watch it. <br/><br/>I can already see TF3... The matrix gets into decepticon hands and they turn the I.S.S into Unicron. With more explosions and crappy one liners than you can even imagine!<br/><br/>overall i give a 2/5 for this film."

This movie i attribute to why i had a long falling out with the transformers property for so long. While the first transformers live action film isn't a particularly amazing film, it was a least a fun action/popcorn flick. This ""film"" on the other hand is not even remotely enjoyable in the ""so bad its good"" sense. Its just, its just cancer on film and is in my opinion the epitome of what is wrong in cinema. Its bloated, sexist, arguably racist and offensive to human beings in general, unenjoyable, drags out way too long, acting that ranges from wooden as a Trojan horse (megan fox) to just annoying as hell (shia), and the only character i didn't want to die in this movie was john turturro, who is an actor that deserves to be in a better film.

","First, let me put this out here: this movie is 2 and a half hours....2 and a half friggen hours!!!<br/><br/>Yet I can probably explain the whole story and plot from start to finish in less than one minute. <br/><br/>Here, I'll give an example of how this movie plays along..it's not really a spoiler when you think about it:<br/><br/>1. Soldiers running away from an explosion 2. Soldiers shooting at something 3. Soldiers running towards airplanes 4. Airplanes flying through the sky 5. More explosions 6. Random shot of Megan Fox in miniskirt/slutty outfit 7. Soldiers shooting at machines, machines shooting at each other 8. Blur of CGI, followed by confusion (i.e who's the bad buy, who's the good guy?) 9. Two dogs humping each other on a couch 10. More shots of Megan Fox in slutty outfits. 11. 30 seconds worth of a Porsche driving down the road, filmed at different angles. Put this clip in every 5 or so minutes. Avoid letting the audience forget what sort of car it was by having a close up shot of the logo every so often. 12. More explosions...followed by people running around 13. More footage of two dogs humping<br/><br/>And there you have it ladies and gentlemen, that's the first 25 minutes of this movie.<br/><br/>The length of this movie is absurd..it could have been cut down to be told in 1 and a half hours...two hours max. And then, it might has passed of as watchable. Instead..""Director"" Michael Bay decides to have ""subtle"" product placement and random, confusing, and unessential battle scenes. By ""subtle"", I mean there is a scene where one character takes out their LG phone...it's not enough to have a clear shot of the phone...no...the camera zooms in just that much more so audiences can clearly see the LG logo.<br/><br/>I'm not a hater of product placement. I'm in the advertising industry. I just hate when product placement is so stupid and blatant. It often ruined the experience. Well then again, this movie was so bad there wasn't much else to ruin.<br/><br/>Megan Fox looked nice but that's all we really see from her in this 'movie'. Her acting is... well let's just say it will be in the best interest of everyone if she just gives up on Hollywood already and releases a porn movie while she's still young.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf has superb acting. He does what he can with a dreadful script.<br/><br/>As for the CGI...Overkill..no that's not the right word...more like : overdose. Just too much..felt like I was going to die watching it. I could not tell the difference between more than one of the transformers. Word of advice: when you have a battle scene between 3 transformers and they crash together and roll around, and you BLUR the 'action' with dodgy camera movement, the three robots TRANSFORM into ONE METALLIC TURD!!!!<br/><br/>Camera work. Well, at one point I thought the camera man had a seizure or he just left to go home early. Wild movements of the camera: LEFT! RIGHT! CIRCLE! ZOOM IN! QUICK, ZOOM OUT!...it literally made me feel dizzy.<br/><br/>Don't even get me started on the plot. It's just like the first movie : ""We have to get the boy!"" *Chase Scene(s)* *Random Explosion(s)* *End of movie*<br/><br/>First movie was OKAY at best, this one is exactly like the first, except more ads and more jumbled storyline, with less of a climax. Seriously, 2 and a half hours, and the final battle between main good guy vs main bad guy lasts a total of 25 seconds MAX...yet an hour earlier the director could afford to have like 5 minutes of pointless sports cars driving around with no real direction. That means, the main bad guy, the one who this movie is named after...the one who is the reason the premise of this movie exists, is whipped out in less than 30 seconds. Great.<br/><br/>Unless you're a child, mentally disabled, or a redneck...don't waste your time with this movie."

","I saw the first movie on my 21st birthday. It was the best day ever. I loved it so much, it was the kind of movie i wanted to see and Bay gave me what i wanted, a mindless popcorn flick for pure entertainment. When i heard the new movie was being made, i got excited.<br/><br/>Eventually some time after its release i went to see Revenge of the Fallen. And i must say i was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Now i was not expecting a thrilling story, with a deep plot and characters who try to win you over. I merely went to see this movie for 'entertainment' purposes and thats exactly what it did for me.<br/><br/>Sure there was a lot going on, some characters i would have liked to see more of and to get to know (i.e Sideswipe, sideways, jolt etc.), the pace was very fast too switching from locale to locale, however this didn't bother me and i was able to keep up fine.<br/><br/>Now i said before i Grinned and Cried during this movie, yes i did, it moved me. The reason for this is the score provided and the pictures which sync'd with it. One of my favourite pieces of music is Arrival to Earth from the first score. When i heard this when optimus first arrived, skydiving, i had a huge smile on my face with excitement, i was finally watching the movie i waited so long for. I cried when optimus decided to take on all 3 decepticons in the forest and died, i cried when optimus was brought back to life and smiled when he combined with Jetfires parts.<br/><br/>For a movie to make me smile and feel so good like that, its worth me going back again to see it, i also look forward to getting the DVD. I just want to say thank Mr Bay, you gave me the movie i wanted to see, it entertained me so much, it has really brightened my day. :)<br/><br/>Looking forward to Part 3 :D"

","I have read bad review after bad review about this film. I went into watching this movie with an open mind that those reviews might be correct. However, I disagree. To anyone knocking the special effects aspect of the movie, what are you thinking? This movie was brilliant in the special effects department. The movie took 200 million dollars to make and every penny showed. There were amazing explosions, smooth robotic fight scenes, and flawless editing. For those that blasted the so-called lack of character development, that is what the first movie was for. Transformers fans want to see what Michael Bay is known for, action. It had a wonderful mix of humor, special effects, romance, and plot development. They, Megan Fox included, did a great job at acting in this film. Every character served as a wonderful addition to the film. Yes, the movie is 2 and a half hours long. In my opinion and those of plenty of others that saw the film, it is well worth it. I encourage anyone to go see this film."

It's like a John Woo shoot out if the Asian guys were robots that turned into cars. This one is not kiddy stuff. You'll forget this is based on a Hasbro toy about thirty seconds into it when the top notch digital fireworks begin. And the kid is quite credible coming out of Eagle Eye. More action that Xmen Origins Wolverine. So many explosions you'll laugh, good ones too, big bad explosions, no kidding. Simply THE best science fiction action film since Terminator 2.

"chrishowe000","8","7","16","20 June 2009"," Superb Popcorn Entertainment
","In my opinion there are two major classes of movie. Firstly there are those that are 'deep and meaningful', often driven by Oscar-worthy acting or plot. And those that are just plain fun; an adrenaline ride and 'popcorn entertainment'. This movie naturally falls into the latter category!<br/><br/>Having read many average-to-poor reviews of movies like this in the past, I also believe that some critics cannot appreciate both classes as an art form. I like to think that I can, and that's one reason why I love both Transformers movies thus far! Additionally, the packed showing I saw yesterday suggests I'm not alone. No, it's not a 'classic' but then most movies aren't anyway.<br/><br/>It is rare that I go to a movie on release day (mainly to avoid the crowds),but sometimes I cannot contain my excitement! From the moment the Paramount Stars came flying around (accompanied with the 'Transformer Noises' of course) I was in entertainment heaven. This film is packed with insane action, genuinely funny comedy and enough military hardware to start a World War! Bay uses many of his usual camera tricks and techniques, making some of the action 'close-in' but generally better that the first film. The sound design is outstanding, and of course ILM - I bow down to your technical wizardry!<br/><br/>While I believe it is common in the US, I can't remember the last time the credits rolled and a UK audience applauded. I would highly recommend this film to most people. Yes you can pick holes in the plot and yes it's not all hugely original. Obviously if you're dead inside, cannot have any fun and details like this will grate on you, don't bother going. Otherwise, sit back, relax and let Michael Bay blow you away with this audio-visual trill ride that will not leave you disappointed!"

","I was reluctant to watch this the first time because of the panning and beating this film got from the critics of the time. But after watching this again, I believe it was totally unwarranted.<br/><br/>A lot of work went into this film including one explosion that took seven months to set up for one-shot.<br/><br/>The relationship between Sam and Mikaela was made stronger especially on her side, which was my largest complaint about replacing Megan Fox in dark of the moon.<br/><br/>I hadn't realized that Peter Cullen has always been the voice of Optimus prime, I had been assuming that they chose a different actor that was able to emulate that great voice. But this is actually Optimus prime.<br/><br/>And the state of the art for this film supersedes the first transformers film by an exponential factor. They were able to do things here that made the CGI much more believable, also the use of practical effects in a lot of places makes it very difficult to see what is CGI and what is not. Sometimes when a transformer was in the scene, it would be a real prop as was the case with bumblebee. Also parts of Megatron.<br/><br/>The story itself was based on certain aspects of the 1984 transformers movie.<br/><br/>It is too bad that the public reacted so negatively to this, so much hard work went into it. And it brings in new auto bot characters, some of which continued through the franchise."

Script - there was almost no story and the story that was there (a battle with a pretty bad ass villain) was put aside to make way for a big dose of unfunny comedy (for every joke that worked, 50 other didn't), unnecessary subplots (noone gives a damn about a romance between 2 cardboard cutouts, we want giant robots fighting) and bad dialogue (it looked like they were making this up on the spot).<br/><br/>2. The cast - everyone except Mr Turturro gave an average performance at best and the 2 leads were the worst actors in the movie (Shia has made a career out of shouting one-syllable words repeatedly and Megan Fox really is as untalented as the critics say).<br/><br/>3. The characters - you know a movie is bad when the characters are 1-dimensional (Character development? What's that?), most of them are comic relief but none of them is funny (again, the credit goes to the script writers) or necessary (this movie could do fine without the college roommate crybaby or the idiot from the government).<br/><br/>4.

It wasn't good or anything, but it was entertaining. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is just junk, plain and simple. There is, literally, nothing. There's no reason to care, no reason to watch, and no reason to waste money on it. It is just junk. That's the best way I can describe it. Junk.

I'll admit I am somewhat of huge Transformers fan, only hooked however by the amazing camera work of the legend that is Michael Bay from the first film. This film takes everything to the new level, the humour, the action, the robot duels, the story, blowing stuff up etc. is now on a new level compared to the first. As far as I am concerned 2.5 hrs is not even enough, I could happily have sat and watched another hour of the film - needless to say I am now counting down the days until the release of Transformers 3. No spoilers here - the magic is watching this film on the biggest screen you can find, I enjoyed every second I was at the cinema (so much I'll be going back again to see it) and I'm sure that this will be the opinion of many who see this film and enjoy what Bay has done with the franchise.

","I really don't get why so many people commented so bad on this film. What did you expect to see when you went and saw this movie? An unpredictable plot that leaves you guessing what you saw? Does anyone remember the Transformers cartoon? They were about big robots that fight each other. = AWESOME!!! First off, you've got new Transformers, and an action packed plot that was fun. I couldn't even fathom the thought of falling asleep. I liked the comedy of Sam's Parents, Bumblebee, and Agent Simmons along with the fighting of Optimus, Megatron, and the armed forces. The special effects in this film were off the chain and I was wowed at every turn This movie was a good time and everything was laid out and elaborated. I recommend to go see it if you are an action buff."

","I can't believe it. I waited for months before seeing this and I was very disappointed. The visuals are excellent, but everything else seemed to be in a mess and rushed. The only scene I actually liked was the Egypt one, and even then, it was a bit confusing. the first movie is like the Godfather compared with this one. I will not be looking forward to a sequel and I hope Michael Bay gets sacked. I'm not the only one that doesn't like this one. Many fans are disappointed. Even Terminator Salvation was better then this! My advice to people about to see this. Do not have high expectations and you might enjoy it, but I completely doubt that."
"namashi_1","6","7","17","10 July 2009"," Michael Bay is fantastic!
","My headline is exactly what you feel after watching the mega-budget 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen'.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has made epics, including the 2007 Super-hit 'Transformers'... this being its sequel doesn't live up-to its previous part. 'Transformers' was an amazing experience, with almost everything going with it. That film was a winner, but the sequel, for which people rushed into the cineplexes and making this a Blockbuster, isn't really that great.<br/><br/>The problem: The script lacks fire, it's paper thin and gets dragging towards the end. As they say, first impression is last impression, the first made people to wow all the way, but the second lacks the fizz. The film doesn't hold in most parts, apart from the climax, there is hardly anything that makes you go Holy Cow!!! <br/><br/>A special mention for: Bay's brilliant direction, one wished he would've come up with a stronger screenplay. Performances by Shia and Megan are top notch. Shia is fantastic. The Graphics are as fascinating as the first.<br/><br/>Minuses: Script doesn't hold.<br/><br/>To sum up, 'Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen' had the potential to make you go wow! But sadly, that doesn't happen here!"
"zahmed_1970","6","7","17","2 July 2009"," Compare to the first one .. this one tanked
","it was highly anticipated movie for this summer but failed to meet the expectations. Unusual long irrelevant scene that could be compressed a lot, annoying characters and a weak story line. Also some of the stuff did not add up, for example, Megatron was huge and scary compare to Optimus in the first one but in this one he was of the same size and weaker. Did not like Sam's roommate character. And now that Megan Fox is a hit, she got longer unnecessary scenes, not to mention she should stop visiting the Plastic Surgeons (her lips are over done, looks like a porn star). The first sliver of the cube which started it all, could have used to revive Optimus instead of the old geezer....."

","OK, whoever complains about film length needs to get used to it: IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED, IT IS BECOMING THE NORM!!! Next, the special effects were fantastic, the plot was different and exciting, and Megan Fox, well, what else is there to say? She stole the show! Although other ignorant people complained about dialog, it added comedy to the film, giving it a whole new appeal. I think someone posted earlier that the transformations were too fast, but I think they took a bit long, if anything! Being a fan of the original series, I have been shocked to love the new one so much, since remakes usually destroy the legends.<br/><br/>Personally, I absolutely loved it, as did the other people who contributed (in total) over 214 million dollars in the US ALONE as of June 29th. It had nearly that outside the country as well. <br/><br/>All you nay-sayers need to learn how to recognize an entertaining and amazing movie when you see one and keep your personal misery to yourselves.

"jmguevara17","4","7","17","28 June 2009"," Truly Awful
","I really hope that this movie is not the biggest hit of the season. The humor is lame, the fight scenes are a blur, and there is barely a plot. I really thought I was watching a different movie when about 6 people clapped afterwards.<br/><br/>This movie stooped to some of the most racist and lamest humor I have ever seen in a film. There were many new robot characters introduced, but few were given any lines. Two ""twin"" autobots made their ""debut"" and were given way too much screen time. They were barely above ""step and fetch-it"" cartoons. They were painful to watch with their fake gold teeth and terrible one-liners. If only their juvenile drivel was the end of the pain to the senses. The movie also includes dog humping, mom high on marijuana brownies, and robot balls.<br/><br/>Shia is great, he's always great to watch, but Meagan Fox is awful. She just pouts and smirks her whole way through the film. When she cries, she looks like she had to pinch herself to produce crocodile tears.<br/><br/>Even with a lack-luster plot and lame potty humor, the action cannot save this lump of a movie. Everything is a blur and you can't tell what's going on. Just take a random action scene from the first movie and transplant it to this new pile, and you wouldn't know the difference. The plot was pretty much explained in the 30 second trailer, so it really doesn't matter if you skip even an hour of this 2:30 hour+ monstrosity."
"sakatsu","3","7","17","27 June 2009"," transformers or Megan fox assets?
","I was OK with the cartoon series but loved the feature length animation. The first live version (part 1) i would consider a decent action fantasy but this sequel is horrendous! I was irritated throughout the whole movie and couldn't wait for it to end. So many loose ends, terrible screenplay/script, bad acting, lousy action sequences seem to fill up the entire movie. If it was any other director, i could forgive but Michael Bay? Come on??! They already had the first one for practice and the countless epic movies he has completed??!. It seems they couldn't decide if they wanted to make it more of an action movie or cheesy romance or a baywatch flick (how much more Megan fox sex appeal do they want to wring out off her? - pout till you drop or please remove your bra so that the audience can feast on her boob 'action' ). It seems Hollywood's stereotype of portraying women as sex objects purveys. Definitely not a movie for the whole family to enjoy. If Megan fox appeal wasn't enough, they brought in another bombshell, Isabel Lucas to add another layer of icing. Sure i enjoy looking at them but this is A TRANSFORMERS MOVIE! The tempo of the movie was terrible. Fast Action scenes suddenly brought down to a snails pace inappropriately with over extended 'i love you' scenes. Just keep the flow going. Don't break it. The college scenes all seem out of place and a waste time. Finally, how could they introduce a Terminator-type robot/cyborg (Isabel Lucas) in a Transformer movie?"
"britflik","4","7","17","27 June 2009"," A surprisingly tedious return for Michael Bay
","Riding on the slipstream of hype created by the 2007 original,this film is a shockingly poorly imagined story based around a bland, simplistic plot with little scope for character progression or even intelligent dialogue.<br/><br/>The film's special effects will leave you flat. After 2 hours of spinning robotic battles they simply bored me as there was often no point of reference on screen so it was difficult to see what was happening. The fact is, you can have too much of a good thing and though the effects are breathtakingly detailed and superb they are simply used for very similar sequences of action again and again.<br/><br/>The goofs in this film are not just to be spotted by the attentive, the middle east is ridiculously redrawn by Michael bay.You can spot LaBeouf and the gang,driving in a matter of minutes, from Petra in Jordan to the Pyramids in Egypt a journey of hundreds of miles. And again we see a certain arch nemesis of Optimus, when arriving back on the scene is about half the size he was in the last film and far worse at fighting.<br/><br/>There are pointless characters such as the cheesily voiced twins, who add bad jokes and surprisingly bad rendering to the films problems. These two reminded me of a Jar Jar Binks like feel, when appealing to the young they are simply annoying and reduce the tone of the film.<br/><br/>When Mikaela first picks up the phone to Sam 5 minutes into the film she demands : 'I'm breaking up with you' he's not in the least concerned and for good reason because a minute later she turns up at his house with some very serious ideas about 'taking it to the next level'. Her serious attempt is never mentioned or referenced in any basis again showing a very poor attempt at heightening audience interest and anticipation relating to their relationship.<br/><br/>The layout is beyond confusing and quotes that are meant to be the epitome of seriousness are hilarious when enunciated in completely the wrong context. The writing of the first film seems to have been altogether left behind for a new path with different style jokes; character emphasis and dramatisation. This direction leads into a film which is one that takes itself too seriously as an action flick not considering that its comic relief is at best thinly spread.<br/><br/>However I will not completely echo the review I saw in my local paper calling the film 'a hollow mockery of a sequel lacking in intelligence and wit'. It does provide some entertainment, with welcome character returns and excellent use of a stun gun as the high points of the film.<br/><br/>Yet the fact that in an action film, the action itself is almost boring. The battle scenes felt tired and insignificant to the films plot and the climactic battle scene was literally laughable in its pointlessness. It left me no choice but to be increasingly disgusted by the average nature of such a film in the days after I saw it."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Director Michael Bay is to film what Scott Boras is to Baseball. And that ain't good. This is just a loud cartoon of a movie with some of the worst dialogue ever uttered by an upright man or machine.<br/><br/>The key players are back. Shia LeBeouf, Megan Fox and John Tuturro pick up their battle against evil and somehow survive when others get easily mangled and killed. After the first 4 or 5 hours I began to just laugh each time they managed to re-do Megan Fox' make-up in the middle of an action sequence. Yes, I realize this isn't supposed to be Saving Private Ryan, but how many pouty poses would most people have if they were in any of these situations.<br/><br/>Shia's parents, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, play a big role in the attempts at humor ... including some lame ass 1970's joke about ""green"" brownies. ugh."

I actually got sleepy, felt like the humans were the sidekicks and weren't as well integrated into the story. Lots of big big explosions, special fx sequences, a few touching moments but you just keep feeling something is terribly missing and wrong about the film. The last portion of the film seems to drag on and on making the finale very anti-climatic...this is one of those sequels where you hope they make a third to repair the damage done by the second film. Ho-hum."
"dctcool","4","7","17","24 June 2009"," Good if you are a fan of mindless explosions, otherwise ...
","OK first of all yes I know its supposed to be a summer blockbuster action film and yes I know its not meant to be considered a serious film, but come on there's only so many explosions and fighting robots I can take before I get board<br/><br/>Lets put the fan-cruft aside for a minute and I'll focus on the film as if it were intended for a general audience, First off keep in mind that this is a sequel so if you haven't seen the first film yet I suggest you go watch that first, speaking of which the first film was fantastic, so well paced great action scenes and great character development that'll make you love some of the characters in the film,<br/><br/>Lets start with the biggest problem of the film's storyline, and thats the balance between being serious and silly, the film has a few serious characters in it but they are way too overshadowed by characters that are in there just for comic relief, it's fine to just have one or two in there problem is this film goes for about 5 and most of them are the main characters. There's a few military scenes that take themselves seriously but the problem here is that you don't know if this film really is taking itself seriously with an over saturation of comedic relief.<br/><br/>The introduction for some of the new characters most notably Skids and Mudflap are rather painful to watch at times, whilst they have their moments their personality seems way too troublemaker stereotypical. The Fallen who is portrayed as the big baddie over Megatron (of all things) in this film has very little to no character development and barely any screen time.<br/><br/>The Deceptacons especially the ones that were given no name are problematic because I feel like most of their basic designs were recycled with some of the characters, their biggest problem is the fact that most of them have the same paint job especially Megatron and Starscream, at times it can be difficult to tell them apart especially during the climatic battles. This is quite a problem cause there are times where you think a certain Deceptacon has been killed only to realize that it was a no named one.<br/><br/>Now onto the Fancruft stuff<br/><br/>First of all the fact that Megatron is a servant for a bigger bad is a kick in the nuts, its well known in the Transformers universe that Megatron is loyal to no one but himself. It also sucks that most of the new Autobots got little to no screen time or lines for that matter, you'd have to actually be a fan to know who some of these characters are and what they can do but for non fans ... Oh and remember the classic transformation sound and the tie in of ""More than meets the eye"" from the first film? yeah no real fan throwbacks here during this 2 1/2 hour long film<br/><br/>Bottom line see the film you you are both a transformers fan AND an action movie fan. If you're not both I'd suggest giving this one a miss or at least wait till the DVD comes out."

","I am now 29 years old. I actually knew that Transformers: Revenge of the fallen was in theaters on 2009. I was in my house during 2009, I have made a deal with my friend, to go to watch it and tell how was it. While I was in the house with my friends, Mom and Dad, when i was talking to everyone, my friend called from his mobile, he told me the film was a mess, cast was not good, effects is good but the story and the Science Fection was terrible! I told him thanks, didn't go, talked with my friends. But now, tomorrow, I have remembered the scene while I was sitting in my house. I actually have bought the Blu-Ray 2013, August 17, Yesterday I watched it. The movie was so terrible! Best effects, but the movie and the story is terrible and horrible. It was a horrible mess. It ended, I turned off it and wrote my review. What is this?? Micheal Bay!!!!............ COME ON, you gotta be horrible, and terribly kidding me!!!!!! The movie is a mess, while I was watching it, I was gonna burn the whole house and the Blu-Ray Disk PLUS the TV. It has got me to this!! Terrible Movie. If I was one of IMDb designers and editors, I would give it 3 over 10, but if I was one of the critics, I would have given it BIG ZERO OVER 10!!!!!!!!!! I mean, what the hell is this crap???

"odiemert","8","6","14","30 June 2009"," As it should be
","Wow, it would appear that many people have misled themselves on what to expect from a Transformers project. Before I begin, I would just like to state that I am in no way taking a defensive position; opinions are opinions, thus we say what we wish....<br/><br/>Now, let's do some motion picture history. As I can remember from my very brief film studies, the first motion picture that people were able to view was a 20 second clip of a train coming to a complete stop toward the viewer, and only one person viewed it at a time since the screen was very small and house in a covered structure that could only fit ones head if they desired to view this amazing achievement. And what an amazing achievement it was as it made people oo and awe for some time. Inevitably, this became the staple of motion picture: to make people oo and awe and entertain so they would inexorably come back for more.<br/><br/>So it would appear that most people seem to be ignorant of this fact. Does a movie like Transformers not allow people to oo and awe and be entertained? One thing that is interesting, is that the majority of the less than approving reviews of this film fail to mention it NOT entertaining them. Rather, they bore themselves with the obvious bad review drivel of ""no story"", ""no characters"", ""too many sexual suggestive shots (which there are few)""... etc, so forth. And I find it interesting that so many people desire there to be some lush, intriguing, thought provoking story with well written character arcs from a Transformers movie.... Is there something strange there? IT'S A TRANSFORMERS MOVIE! Large, talking robots waring with each other for possible humility, dominance, and survival that all began as toys. And it's also not fully meant for a young audience, rather an audience that chooses to watch a Transformers movie, keeping in mind that young people might like a loud movie with fighting robots.<br/><br/>Lastly, there is plenty of character, nostalgic story and Autobot/Decepticon characters to allow this film to be what it is. So I just think that too many people are exhausting themselves these days by expecting, and wanting so much more from modern action movies. Rather, these films should be taken for what they are: Tansformers movies that rely on our senses to be ooed, awed, dazzled by the effects, and to be entertained. So if all you wish is so much more than what these films will offer you, than it's simple: Don't watch them. But if you're able to simply allow these films to give you what they can only offer, than sit down and have fun, because that is what Transformers is all about. And the only reason that I gave it 8 instead of 9 (nothing deserves 10 - what's beyond perfect?), is that I was kinda hoping for some Dinobots - oops, did I just contradict myself? ..."
"lika-st","10","6","14","30 June 2009"," Transformer 2"" the Revenge of the Fallen
","Despite of unambiguity of the ending of the first part of ""Transformers"", nevertheless the second film was issued. I, as one of most staunch admirers of comics about Transformers and comics in general, was extraordinary glad and I waited with impatience for « the Revenge of the fallen ». Film has turned out to be bright, saturated and entertaining.<br/><br/>Two years have passed since those events that have occurred in the first film, and all main characters try to return to normal life: Sam enters the University, his parents take a long-waited holiday, Michaela ""looks"" after her recently set free dad, and Prime in cooperation with major Lennox reflect attacks from other bad transformers. And everything would be great, but they don't want to reconcile with defeat and decide to revenge – to be exact, just to blow up the sun. <br/><br/>In comparison with the first part, all transformers become more talkative, there are also new characters among transformers. Much more humor become in the film in order as obscene language. Special effects are also amazing, here everything is great.<br/><br/>As for the cast, so ""Transformers"" can be characterized as one of the few projects in which actors are picked up faultlessly. Shia LaBeouf has made a great job; he's perfectly coped with his role. In comparison with the first film, Shia's character becomes more courageous and charming. Megan Fox has made her heroine more sensitive and delightful. These qualities were in deficiency in the previous film about transformers. Appearance of agent Simmons has pleased me very much. In the second film his character spiritually progresses on spectator's eyes and becomes a true hero. Basically, all have perfectly coped with their characters: Josh Duhamel, Isabel Lucas, and Tyrese Gibson. <br/><br/>And of course the music. The soundtrack is brilliant! Especially I liked the new song of Linkin Park, sounding in credits.<br/><br/>As a result, ""Transformers 2"" is an excellent summer blockbuster, which is impossible to pass. <br/><br/>10/10"
"flowsnobordr","8","6","14","26 June 2009"," A movie for the Transformer fan...
","First of all I went into this movie as a Transformer fan before a film appreciator... I mean can one really go into a Michael Bay movie expecting genuine artistic vision? The answer to that riddle is ""NO"".<br/><br/>While I highly enjoyed this film for it being a tale of the Transformers I have to say this was a movie with amateur all over it. Prime example the whole college scene. Why would anyone need to see Sam's mother running around baked on brownies when if they were making a joke it could have been simple show the baggy and end scene? Another problem was having this 90210 cheesy music playing in the background while Sam and Mikaela have some Laguna Beach style love dialogue. Even though every guy will cheer, Megan Fox does not need to pose in every scene simply because everyone already knows she is a bombshell. Last, while I enjoyed Jetfire's appearance it's disappointing how he was personified to resemble an old wise man while in the animated version he was made to look powerful more than old. Those were just a few problems that were in the film but they were the ones that bothered me the most.<br/><br/>Transformers and explosions are what make up most of this movies credibility. The fight scenes in The Fallen were shot much better than the first due how the scenes were shot to where both bots could be seen on screen and slowed down enough at times so the cgi would not distort. This can all be seen simply in the battle seen in the forest. This movie probably would have been better if it was just shot from Josh Duhamel's and Tyrese's side because it showed the alliance built between the humans and Transformers. Plus it would have been better, in between action, than hearing some love chat between Shia and Megan. On the Transformer fan side one will jaw drop at the amount of bots that are involved with the plot especially when the constructicons are brought to the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie itself if you're prepared for the fact that you will be watching a Michael Bay film you will enjoy it. Me being a huge Transformers fan is why I gave it an 8 because as a film its a 6 at best. It seems like all Bay did was phone is script while focusing on action. One can only wonder why they don't higher a credible director for the basic scenes and just use Bay for the action scenes. In the end it sucks to see an amazing heroic story that is the Transformers turned into a summer popcorn flick."
"Danish_Psycho","7","6","14","26 June 2009"," Not as good as the first, but still entertaining
","I'll start with the bad things: 1. My major problem with this movie was its copy-pasting of scenes from the first movie. From meteors entering the atmosphere, to scout planes in the dessert and re-runs of explosions, this really got to me. Don't know why. 2. It's hard to tell the transformers apart. It was much easier in the first one. It also seems that most of the new transformers, especially the decepticons, are more generic. No names, no identity, they are just there and that was a bit disappointing. 3. The twins! I wouldn't say that they sucked...to me...they were just unnecessary. And people find them racist, which to me sounds like those people are searching for something to be insulted or angry by. 4. SPOILER! The ending was...very anti-climatic. An hour of build-up, and the final fight lasts for 30 seconds...Huge let-down. 5. Transformer as a sexy woman??? If they can transform into humans...why still use cars or cats and so on?<br/><br/>The good parts. 1. Alien Robots...that transforms! 2. Megan Fox. She has never looked hotter, and she alone would make this movie worth watching. 3. Decent humor. The humor in the first film was pretty good, the second is still fun, but not as much. 4. Incredible, expensive over-the-top kick-ass awesome action. Amazing fights, battles, one-liners...so much in fact that it unfortunately seems to be too much. I never thought I'd say that, but there is actually too much action in it.<br/><br/>So why does everyone hate Michael Bay so much? And if so, why do they continue watching his movies. If you liked Michael Bays previous movies, or if you enjoyed Transformers, then this movie would be worth seeing. You probably won't find it as good as the first, so don't expect it to. If you don't like Michael Bay, then this movie will not be for you, and you should save your money and complaints for something else.<br/><br/>This movie is pure, mindless action. And a lot of it. Don't expect too much other than this and you won't be disappointed."

"C-Younkin","4","6","14","23 June 2009"," Long but well improved
","Is this the must-see movie event of the summer? Yeah, you know it is. Despite critics (myself included) complaining about almost everything except how cool the special effects were, the first one was a huge hit so Michael Bay brings all of his toy cars back to the big screen in ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" This newer model comes with some of the same problems the first film had, a few improvements, and an altogether more cohesive and entertaining experience, albeit slightly longer than one would really like out of such a popcorn movie. This one picks up two years after the events of the first film.<br/><br/>With Megatron (Hugo Weaving) buried beneath the ocean and the allspark in a secured location, Earth is safe for the time being. The autobots, led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), now fight alongside the American military (Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson included) combating remaining Decepticons hiding out on Earth. While cleaning up in Shanghai, Optimus is told by a dying Decpticon that the Fallen will rise again. It doesn't mean a whole lot, but its enough to put everyone on alert. Meanwhile, Sam (Shia LeBeouf) is heading to college, his hero status an annoyance to him now, as is his guardian Bumblebee. Then again his girlfriend is Mikaela (Megan Fox) so life ain't all bad. But as Optimus so nobley says, ""fate rarely calls upon us at a moment of our choosing."" Sam begins to see cyber code to the point where he has a mental breakdown. Mikaela comes to Sam's aid but what they don't know is that Megatron has been brought back to life and he is now reunited with his master, the Fallen (Tony Todd). They invade Earth, demanding that Sam surrender to them, for the code he sees will lead the Fallen to a machine that blows up the sun while renewing life on the Decepticon planet. Of course Sam, Mikaela, and the rest have to stop that from happening.<br/><br/>Ehren Kruger joins screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman but I'd be hard pressed to tell you what he brings to the writing, the plotting being essentially the same, just swapping the allspark energy source for the machine. I doubt fans will mind. More to the point, the action is wall to wall, all-out mayhem and this time its not so hyperactive to the point where you can barely make out what's going on. Optimus and Bumblebee each get their moment to kick some major ass, lots of destruction (cities, fleet ships, pyramids, etc), and the guns blaze and robots rock'em-and-sock'em-each other with major intensity. While all this is good, I still contend that Bay could go bigger though, especially with these special effects at his disposal. A really well planned action set-piece (ala the car chase in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" for example) could really elevate this series from good to grand. This hurts the finale especially, which is hectic and all-over-the place but offers nothing incredibly cool. The finale also suffers from battle overload, at this point the guns-blazing and robot fighting going on way too long. Cutting a half hour wouldn't have hurt this movie.<br/><br/>What helps this time around though is more Megatron. He's a ferocious villain who rightfully deserves more screen time. However, one wonders why so little screen time for most of the other autobots. Other than Optimus and Bumblebee, the rest only have brief moments in battle scenes, except for the Twins, Mudflap and Skids, who sound like Katt Williams and are probably the most annoying comic relief since Jar Jar Binks. Most other robots are mainly used for exposition, a long-winded detailing of the machine is just one of many overly talky scenes. Just show us the special effects, which stand as some of the most technically superior I've ever seen. Slicker, bigger, and badder, just looking at these magnificent robots brings out the kid in me. It's here that the movie is really inspired, as different types of robots fill the screen. Cougars, sattelites, preying mantis, and one that looks very similar to the alien in ""Species."" From a design stand-point, this is awesome.<br/><br/>Acting isn't a major priority here but the cast does it's job well enough. Shia is the new sorta nerdy, sorta brave techno hero. He also has good comic timing and gets some very good laughs. Megan Fox, introduced in a sexy pose leaning over a motorcycle, is probably the most incredible looking non-robot in the movie and there are even occasions where she comes through as a decent actress. Kevin Dunn and Julie White, as Sam's cheapskate father and naïve mother, get the bulk of the hilarious laughs, as does a loopy John Turturro reprising his role as the quirky Agent Simmons, this time working with Sam. The characters played by Jon Voight, Anthony Anderson, and Rachel Taylor have wisely been deleted and things move along a lot better now that its not so top heavy with extra characters who serve no purpose. The voice acting for the robots is well matched, especially from Hugo Weaving and Tony Todd, adding more dread to Megatron and the Fallen, and Peter Cullen giving authority to Optimus. There is also a nice ode to Joe Pesci in ""Goodfellas"" that's pretty funny.<br/><br/>""Revenge of the Fallen"" is not without its flaws, but the good outweighs the bad and this is by far right behind ""Star Trek"" as the blockbuster of the summer.<br/><br/>For more reviews, check out Leesmovieinfo.com"
"falling_away_from_me1","10","6","14","21 June 2009"," Awesome film that exceeded my expectations!
","When going to see this film, i was slightly worried i'd be left in bitter disappointment. Luckily i was worrying for nothing! This film was exactly what i expected...2 and a half hours of action, and despite what people say, a story.<br/><br/>I didn't think this film could have possibly competed with the brilliance of the first film. To some extent i was correct, but overall this film demolished it! I knew the beginning was going to be know where near as big and epic as the first, but some of the battles more than made up for that. And another thing i loved about this film was the humour. Some bit's were hilarious and had me in fits of laughter! As usual, the up and coming star Shia LaBeouf did an amazing job at acting as his character Sam Witwicky. The more I see of him these days, the more impressed I am with his awkward acting style.<br/><br/>Overall if you were a fan of the 1st first film, i'd welcome this sequel with your arms wide open. I can honestly say this was one of the funnest and most visually impressive films i've seen in a long time (along with star trek). I've tried reviewing Transformers revenge of the fallen without giving away any of the plot at all, but i'm still hoping people find this useful and encourages them into seeing this film. Steven Spilberg has yet again made a masterpiece!"

","I had high hopes for this, add it failed, but it was still good.<br/><br/>Bad points: shaky camera, not enough atmosphere, humans manage to run and hide from 10 massive killer machines by jumping around some ruins for 20 minutes, the audience doesn't know what the hell is happeneing, you barely get to dwell on the Superb ruins for a couple of seconds and so in a sense there is no backdrop, save for the desert canyon area which gives a moment of respite from the shaking.<br/><br/>The transformations weren't as good as the 1, there is even a proper giant transformer which is made of 5 vehicles, and they show you the vehicles juping onto a macine and the machine after, but they don't show you the transformation. which should take at least a few seconds. all the transformations are a 1 second blur unfortunately.<br/><br/>the goody robots are abit more stupid than in 1, with big wonky teeth and silly voices. surprised me.<br/><br/>It moves too fast, and there are barely any scenes that are cinematic or scene like, its a blur of machines and scenery.<br/><br/>That said, the actors are Great, no complaints, fun people to see.<br/><br/>there are some awesome moments. some of the human moments are pretty good, nice settings in college and Egypt.<br/><br/>the end was kind of good and different, a mass of human and robot large shots in a surge of passion, it works out okay because without a climax at the end it would have been pretty drab! i have short memory.<br/><br/>the good thing about art and music is the silence and the emptiness in between the events. here there was only events, no pause for thought or feelings, but pretty spectacular. for a shallow exciting blast, its 8/10"
"tomstharp","1","9","24","9 July 2009"," I Feel Sick
","First off, why is everything spinning? The dang cameraman can't hold the camera still for a half a second so we can get some perspective on what the heck is going on! To state my credentials for commenting, I make movies too, leave it at that. The mood is all wrong in every scene where the viewer is supposed to feel something. The action sequences are all shaky cam and pyrotechnics. The humor is misplaced and inappropriate for the demographic of the movie.<br/><br/>Mood: Helicopter drops Prime like a sack of moldy oranges during an emotional scene. Why does it drop him, what purpose does this serve? None, it just lets the movie have one more dust cloud.<br/><br/>Action: Prime apparently cuts apart a dozen or so nameless Decepticons before being overwhelmed. Who were these robots? Also, if Shia can RUN to the fight, why couldn't the other auto-bots get there in time as they had been where Shia was before the action sequence started?<br/><br/>Humor: Dog humping, drug using, stereotypical etc. Definitely an attempt to shoehorn humor into dull repetitive action.<br/><br/>Conclusion: No redeeming features, entire thing was obviously mishandled from inception to release."
"DICK STEEL","2","11","31","23 June 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
","The story, if it's any excuse to call it one, involves Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) facing some teenage existential romance issues, quite petty amongst the world's concerns that the Decepticons are not yet a done deal, with the Autobots joining forces with US soldiers forming NEST, an operations unit with jurisdiction just about anywhere in the world, because the world does not have soldiers, or competent ones at that – Jordan only has 2 choppers being swatted down like flies.<br/><br/>Throw in more bureaucratic nonsense like a rehash of the first film, the return of Josh Dumahel and Tyrese Gibson giving a collective to soldiers on the ground, John Turturro for some weak linkage to the first film, and a highly irritating, immature Ramon Rodriguez in a nerdy roommate role who got caught up in situations he never bargained for. In fact, there are so many frat boy situations and lame jokes tossed around, that it made it seem that the scriptwriters and filmmakers all had some repressed teenage fantasies they needed to play out on screen. Needless characters, just like the Witwicky parents, just bloat the screen and the runtime, just to have more human presence in the story, but serving little purpose other than to elicit some cheap laughter.<br/><br/>Sure, Michael Bay had responded to fans clamouring for more robots in disguise, but that had translated to a load of nameless, faceless robots either created just for laughs thanks to a renegade allspark fragment, or introduced so that they can be blasted to smithereens. Even the final assault of Decepticons were made up of unknown, generic looking robots that were there for cannon fodder. As for Devastator, what a big let down and a cop out. That on screen is not the composite giant robot I had known through the years, and reeks like the Americanized Godzilla where its orientation became severely changed, here to serve nothing more than a huge vacuum cleaner.<br/><br/>Nameless, faceless robots extend to the Autobots too, with Optimus Prime and Bumblebee taking up most of the screen time being obvious fan favourites, with others being Ironhide, the newly created Twins, and supporting acts like Arcee and Sideswipe, together with loyalty flipfloppers like Wheelie (whom I thought all along was supposed to be an Autobat) and Jetfire (this stays true, in a way). The biggest let down of all would be the Fallen, supposedly one bad-assed transformer with a huge axe to grind, becoming nothing more than a lazy bastard whose threats he made get forgotten about totally, in between snarls.<br/><br/>If there's anything of merit here, then yes, hats off to the CGI folks who have upped the ante with their numerous detailed transformations of robots to vehicles, and vice versa. There were action sequences intricately crafted, but alas some dodgy camera angles sometimes get in the way of their creative genius. There were a handful of action sequences which fell prey to extreme close ups and resulted in a huge mesh and mess of clanging metal being welded together and thrown about on screen, where you can hardly tell who's who, made all the more difficult when the Decepticons aren't as brightly coloured. The finale is some 30 minutes, but largely reminiscent of the old cartoon series where you have two opposing combatants occupying one side of the screen each, and firing everything at one another, and missing a whole lot. Then wash-rinse-repeat, or cue heroic Autobot who rips apart the enemy without dripping engine oil.<br/><br/>Fans of the history of Transformers might feel a little mixed with the origins of the Transfomers explained here in a little bit more detail, a continuation of the allspark artifact seen in the previous film, with biblical elements like the fallen angel with the featuring of an important element such as the leadership matrix. Even a moment of the Transformers animated film found its way here, though I will not reveal what it is since it's a huge plot point and fuels pretty much the entire 2nd half of the film. And if there's one major gripe I have to make, it is this – Bumblebee is a four-seater Camaro (and we're reminded about this time and again), but to Sam, he'd rather pack his folks into the car, while opting to run some 4 miles in the desert dust to a common destination amidst a raging all out war. Right, yay to illogical heroic moment misconstrued to be sacrifice.<br/><br/>I will unabashedly say that I've enjoyed the first Transformers movie, but this sequel is obviously churned out to milk the fanboys of their money, together with so many blatant merchandising opportunities with variations of toys. But that's what the fans want, and that's probably what they got and lapped up, given the reaction of the audience who laughed at every single unfunny moment, cheered at every robot death, and roared with approval with every shot of a military vehicle put in just because Bay could. One should be offended by what went on screen in a total waste of time and budget, and this goes down in my books as an over-hyped and stale summer blockbuster."

I congratulate Michael Bay by doing and to continue doing this kind of movies and I should confess that I am not big fan of the original cartoons is very possible that I will see it all.<br/><br/>Linkin Park's new song ""New Divide"", I listened it two days before the premiere in YouTube, but was not that good for me until when was in the movie theater in the end of the film, it fitted perfect like their first Transformers Soundtrack song ""What I've Done"", please keep it that way!!!

"masonsaul","6","2","3","19 December 2018"," Nowhere near as good as the first
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nowhere near as good as the first but still an enjoyable sequel. The plot is dumb and ridiculously convoluted and some of the new human characters are pointless. The attempts at humour are awful and it focuses way too much on the human characters. However Shia LaBeouf is still really good and the third act is as ridiculously action packed as you expect from Michael Bay. Michael Bay's direction is especially good in the forest fight, resulting in an excellently filmed and really fun fight that is one of the best action sequences in the entire franchise. Also, Steve Jablonsky's score is great."

"dayness","8","1","1","3 July 2020"," Really not the worst movie ever.
","Don't get me wrong, I don't think it's a masterpiece but there are some good stuff that people ignore. My main issues are the movie literally reusing scenes from its own series and own movie which I think is incredibly lazy. My second issue is the comedy mostly ranges from bad to embarrassingly awful and a lot of stuff are a bit too sexualized. Some of the plot holes people point out can be easily figured out by paying attention to the movies plus the twins honestly don't bother me that much (if they do, I completely understand why but I've seen much worse). The CGI is still great and the work on Devastator should get some credit (they had to use multiple computers to render him). I like the sound track here as well since it fits the summer atmosphere that this movie is trying to give. I like the additions of soundwave (although he does more in the next movie), sideswipe, devastator, ravage, long haul, mixmaster, demolisher, jetfire and the fallen himself. The intro is also really good and I prefer it over the one in the first movie (however to be far they are both still good). The pacing is a bit slower than the first movie but I was still able to pay attention and watch the movie without being bored since the human story and transformers story are both linked together. The forest fight is the big highlight and even people who don't like this movie can agree that it's the best thing about this movie. I also liked the last fight with jet-powered prime as well even if it was a little bit too short but prime is also more powerful so that should explain why it's shorter than a normal prime fight. Overall, it isn't as good as the first movie but it isn't complete garbage as many people make it out to be and it might have been better if there wasn't a writers strike going on."

","As with any sequel, it is expected to be bigger and better than the first film. 'Transformers 2' offers much more on action and CGI. Although it was maybe a bit too CGI-heavy, it goes with the territory considering the nature of the film, and was still thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>The impressive action-packed opening sequence set the standard for what was to come. Once again, the visuals are incredible. The story continues as the Decepticons learn of a shard of the Allspark Cube remaining still, and they'll do anything to get it. Naturally, chaos and mayhem follow as the Decepticons destroys much of the cities around the world. And boy, Michael Bay does enjoy destroying things!!<br/><br/>Most of the original cast is back to reprise there roles, which I enjoyed. It was not as suspenseful as the original, as this film has a lot more humor. The Transformer twins were just stupid as the comic relief characters and it would have been so much better without them. The library scene was really great, and the desert attack scene in Egypt was simply awesome! The action is insane! I must be honest, though, I enjoyed the first film much more."
"mardalsfossen01","6","1","1","11 February 2019"," Decent Sequel
","The way the plot goes on does add up overall.
The CGI is still the same, the way it's written is still the same. It's solid, but they could've shown more improvement compared to the first Transformers.<br/><br/>
And because I don't see a major improvement to the prequel and the writing and characters are still a bit bland, I give it 6/10 and therefore 1* less than the previous one even though it's not much worse and still a decent watch."

"destinylives52","8","1","1","27 May 2018"," Ridiculous But Still Entertaining
","Why do I give this ridiculous movie such a high grade? I like Bumblebee.<br/><br/>""Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen"" throws logic out the window and doesn't seem to care if you notice it; and of course, lots of fast paced, loud and lengthy action sequences are shoved in your face to shake off those critical thoughts you are trying to formulate.<br/><br/>So...who exactly are ""The Fallen?"" It turns out to be a single, high ranking Decepticon, just waiting out in space for the last Prime (Optimus Prime) to be destroyed. Oh, this Fallen dude is Megatron's boss, and Megatron will stop at nothing to bring his boss back to power. But, how is Megatron still alive, you wonder. Well, the U.S. government, in its infinite wisdom, takes Megatron's body and dumps it into the deepest part of the ocean. Why didn't they just let Optimus Prime tear him into so many pieces that Megatron can never come back? Why not shoot Megatron with howitzer shells laced with phosphorous? Why not...never mind. Anyway, a shard of the allspark thingy from the first movie is used by the evil Decepticon transformers to bring Megatron back to life; and now the Decepticons are racing to the Middle East to activate a device that will destroy the Sun, and the Autobots and a few good humans are there to meet them head on and stop their evil plans.<br/><br/>Okay, I can't wait anymore to tell you of my biggest gripe: a Decepticon Terminator. Transformers have the power to scan a machine and take on that form, right? But in this movie, they can now transform into Size 0 models. Yup, skin, hair, all that. How? It's not explained. This is where I hold my hands up and just shake my head. The revelation of the Decepticon/Terminator woman is my most memorable, movie moment of ""Revenge Of The Fallen,"" memorable because of how bad this screenplay can get.<br/><br/>Typical of Michael Bay movies, the pacing is fast, there are numerous, poignant scenes that quickly vanish, the action sequences are spectacular, and logic takes a back seat. If you don't take it too seriously, this second ""Transformers"" movie can be very entertaining. Despite the overall stupidity of the script, it does manage to elevate itself slightly because of the running themes of friendship and loyalty and sacrifice.<br/><br/>Mannysmemorablemoviemoments"
"muhammedelgammal_","7","1","1","21 April 2016"," A long transformation
","Yet again, the special effects in this movie were out of this world.<br/><br/>The story was great, but it was stretched out way to long. There was a bunch of extra nonsense in the middle of the movie that could have been taken out.<br/><br/>The fight scene that took place directly after Megatron's revival between Optimus Prime and the Decepticons was full of intense action and absolute destruction. It was the best fight scene yet between the Autobots and the Decepticons.<br/><br/>The Fallen, the ultimate villain in this movie, is also a prime like Optimus. He was made out to be much more evil than that of Megatron. But yet, there was not that much of him in the movie up until the very end of the movie. All that hype was for really nothing. It was the same mistake made in the first movie with Megatron's character.<br/><br/>Despite the length of the movie and the short lived screen life of The Fallen, the movie was not bad. The special effects are much better than that of the first movie. There is also a difference in the voices of the Transformers; they sound more humanistic than robotic now."
"trooper5783","9","1","1","2 January 2016"," The one Transformers movie that's good.
","I actually saw this movie at a generally filled theater in Virginia around early July of 2009, a tad bit after it's official release in late June. I was 8 years old and I liked the first Transformers, although not as much as my brother, who was 6 at the time, who was a huge fanatic of all sorts of robots and creatures fighting in the Saturday morning cartoons, and he was extremely pumped, but I wasn't too excited, although I did think it looked like a good movie. I saw it with my family, and we loved it! I didn't know this got bad reviews at the time because I wasn't familiar with film critics, and I won't say it's perfect, but it's a great summer film in its own right. The action and special effects are extravagant, particularly the forest battle and whenever a computerized Transformer is interacting with a human character. But I'll say that some of the comedy maybe a little too awkward to watch with families, in addition, the Leo character wasn't important nor funny in the slightest. Other than a couple of small problems, ROTF is a ton of fun for Transformers fans and action movie fans."
"joshuadrake-91275","9","1","1","29 September 2015"," I don't hate this one! My second favorite in the series!
","Following the success of the first TRANSFORMERS, a sequel was announced for a summer 2009 release, but had to go through a lot before it was released and the Writers' Strike was one of them and the film received almost negative reviews from critics.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who is caught in the war between two factions of alien robots, the Autobots and the Decepticons. Sam is having hallucinatory episodes of Cybertronian symbols, and is being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named The Fallen (Tony Todd), who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process.<br/><br/>The story is very incoherent, but I still watch this movie and like I said, this movie had a lot to go through before being released and I am not going to talk about this movie. My god, man. I can't hate this movie.<br/><br/>If there is one thing I hate about this movie, that is a scene where Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron and I did feel some emotion in the scene, but I almost cried because he was killed and did not come back into this film until before the end credits come on and when he comes back, it is okay, but I just did wish they did not kill him off in the middle portion of the film.<br/><br/>The visual effects on the Transformers are really amazing as hell and it was fantastic, but the CGI on the Fallen is a little off, but it is really amazing. The musical score by Steve Jablonsky is really amazing and the score is just fantastic as hell, especially with the other Transformers films and the scary movie remakes produced by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller, this includes the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday THE 13th remakes. The acting is amazing. Shia LaBeouf once again plays Sam Witwicky and he does an amazing job. Megan Fox is really hot and cool as Mikaela Banes and this would be her last TRANSFORMERS film, and I would have loved to have seen her play that character in the third film. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are cool in their roles, too. John Turturro is really funny, but there are scenes that the humor is taken way too far in this film.<br/><br/>Isabel Lucas as Alice is creepy and hot in the screen time that she has. The other person, Ramon Rodriguez is funny as hell as Leo in this film and I would have liked to have seen him in the third film as well.<br/><br/>This would be the last film to be distributed by DreamWorks Pictures as Paramount Pictures distributed future films in the franchise.<br/><br/>Overall, with TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, I love and hate this film and that's pretty much it. I give it a 5 out of 10 because I have the two-disc DVD and I watched the special features and even the documentary and I felt sorry for the filmmakers and cast doing this film, but they made one hell of a sequel. Critics should have gave this movie a lot of critical praise for this movie.<br/><br/>This is Michael Bay's worst reviewed films along with Pearl Harbor, Transformers: Age of Extinction and Bad Boys II."

"milofromtheblock","4","7","18","20 June 2009"," The Bayhem brought to its illogical conclusion
","This film is a mess of ideas, explosions and shaky cam that fails to deliver anything near a coherent scene let alone a coherent plot. Bay tries far too hard, throwing so many ideas at the screen that none are given the opportunity to stick, let alone breathe. Over 40 robots appear over the 150 minute runtime of the film of which 1, Starscream, gets any kind of character development beyond the 3 set types, good, evil, or annoying.<br/><br/>The robots themselves are in dire need of some internal logic, what are their abilities? How are they made? Are their components sentient? As it is, the robots are so diverse as to defy any kind of movie logic explanation, some can disguise themselves, some are animalistic, some have opinions, some can break up into smaller pieces, some have apparent genitalia. The sheer number of them also cloud the issue, making it impossible to know, or recognise all the robots in the large fight scenes so that its very hard to tell whats going on and who's shooting who. Thats certainly not helped by the fact they all share the same shiny metal aesthetic and nearly everything is shot in close up shaky cam. Its symptomatic of a film that feels like it started with Michael Bay writing everything he thought was cool or funny on a sheet of paper and then trying to craft a script around it.<br/><br/>That might have worked better if Michael Bay had any kind of sense of humour. Dogs and robots hump each and people's legs furiously, LeBeouf mugs gamely but even his talents can't make up for the drivel he is given, but even he fares better than the awful material given to his screen parents. A special mention goes to the hip hop lingo spouting twin robots ruin every scene they are in. The biggest laugh in the screening I saw was for a man wearing a thong which says all you need to know.<br/><br/>The plot, such as it is, lacks coherence. I'm not asking for epic storytelling or multi-layered plots, I'm not even asking for emotional involvement, just a better explanation of what the evil guy's plan and why everyone is seemingly shooting everyone else in the desert. If I'm trying to snatch positives I could mention that Megan Fox is absurdly hot for the whole film, but thats partly because the camera ogles her curves at every opportunity, notably as shes bent over a motorcycle in the most gratuitous shot i've ever seen outside porn.<br/><br/>Overall its a bad, messy, dumb movie that I wouldn't recommend even for the unreconstructed action film fan in all of us."

","So I've noticed that everyone in this film is covered in large amounts of tan makeup, everyone is quite orange at times. So Mr Bay brings us his second Transformers film, its got a good title and sounds like its gonna be dark and brooding, hopefully like 'Empire Strikes Back' it would be the sequel that betters the original. Alas I was disappointed hugely by yet another loud CGI filled mess which was overly long and actually became a little dull.<br/><br/>The main issue for me being the constant redesigning of classic Transformer characters into characters that are virtually unrecognisable as anything but a mass of shiny moving parts. Most of the transformers look terrible with some dreadful designs, I can't for the life of me work out why they have designed the Decepticons to look spiky and more insect like, there are specific Decepticons for that and they are called Insecticons. Plus most of the Decepticons don't even look like Transformers they look more like robotic aliens from another film 'Batteries Not Included' and 'Short Circuit' springs to mind, the Decepticon disguised as a female student was the worst offender.<br/><br/>I don't mind reinventing the characters for a new age but lets try and be sensible here and not go over the top, I mean what the hell was going on with Mudflap' n 'Skids?! talk about your politically correct Transformers for the black audience geez! not too obvious. Then you have the wildly bizarre looking Devastator, I actually didn't mind his new look too much but for some reason they make the large bots more like monsters in a 'Godzilla' way instead of characters with actual sense. Jetfire was probably the best looking new character but again like all the characters he's too much with a lot of needless extra bits 'n' bobs that make the overall design far too busy and very difficult to distinguish or decipher.<br/><br/>They keep totally reinventing what the Transformers look like and making them look poor, why not try to keep them reasonably similar to their original designs? For a start the original designs look so much cooler, if it ain't broke don't fix it.<br/><br/>As for the film itself I found the first half quite dull as we are introduced to Sam's life after the first film. Things pick up as the Transformers become more prominent and we build up towards a showdown in Egypt but the finale is so drawn out and actually loses its impotence because its just keeps on going. Its also rather stupid too as you have all these military guys running around trying to attack the Decepticons whilst looking all heroic but the film already established how useless humans are fighting Transformers prior to this so its just all noise and time wasting.<br/><br/>Not only that but the creators make the crucial mistake in any film by having faceless characters just for death sequences, in the finale when the Decepticons begin their assault numerous robots touch down and fight resulting in many deaths of unknown Decepticons. Add to that the fact they also killed off all the main well known Decepticons too! Devastator and Ravage dead!! what the hell!! they are main characters in Transformer history! and so cheaply too. I still don't understand why they didn't include more regulars in both of these films, regulars like Thrust, Ramjet, Laserbeak, Rumble, Thundercracker etc...same for Autobots too.<br/><br/>End of the day this film looks pretty yes, the CGI is very very highly impressive with the detail and blending of live action sequences but that's it, the film is a visual feast with nothing else to offer accept noise and a blur of unrecognisable images. The acting is pretty dire frankly and the whole thing is so cliché ridden eg. slow motion running with explosions behind and lots of amusing military cheese.<br/><br/>If this was a film unrelated to Transformers then I might be more kind to it, ever so slightly, despite the mass CGI it would be an imaginative film and bold. Seeing as its suppose to be an adaptation of a beloved childhood cartoon colossus of epic proportions with legendary historic status I simply cannot say it deserves any of the hype it got.<br/><br/>1/10"

","(6%) If anyone wants to know exactly what is wrong with modern day, big budget action movies then watch this. It may be of an oversubscribed opinion but I really do hate this movie, so much so that after walking out the cinema I thought long and hard about never coming back. Many criticise the ""Lord of the rings"" films for being over-long, but at least in those movies things happened, nothing happens here but a far from fantastic cast sometimes spouting awful lines while some of the worst action ever directed is poured by the truckload onto the screen. Who would have ever thought that two massive robots smashing ten bells out of each other would be as tiresome as watching a TV shopping channel? Then there is Mudflap and Skids that make Jar Jar Binks look tolerable, the ""plot"" that mostly involves the cast running over there, driving over here, flying over to this place, doing this then doing that and none of it is ever clear why, they just do it. This really could be the worst film ever made simply down to the fact that it cost so much money to make, but then again it did make a fortune back in the box office, and the worst part is that some of that box office takings is my doing. They never got me in for the third one though so that is at least something."
"conquerorsaint","3","6","15","28 October 2010"," Who else wants a Zack Snyder Reboot down the line?
","Having just re-watched it on cable last weekend, the first time I've seen it since getting ripped off in theaters last year, I can definitely say it got worse on second viewing and will definitely download the next one.<br/><br/>The first hour seemed decent enough if a bit underwhelming in parts due to the overly comedic parents having much more screen time than ever. But then the retarded hillbilly auto-bots showed up as poor excuses of comic relief and that's when everything started downhill (on a steep slope at that).<br/><br/>WARNING : Somewhat disjointed rants and SPOILERS on various parts of the movie upcoming.<br/><br/>The story is one of the worst pieces of possible stories they could come up with, like a really bad fan fiction. The fallen? Megatron was built up to be some bad mutha****** and then in the sequel he has a mentor/master just biding his time since the past thousand years? Oh and mega-tron could just hop back and forth to Cybertron and back faster than a daily commute? Also Prime happens to arrive in the nick of time to save Sam's pansy ass yet again WITH BUMBLEBEE but with no other auto-bots in the immediate vicinity to help him tussle with the decepticons? His death tried too much to be a shocker to be effective since it is also in part due to his clumsiness that did him in. Now comes the downward skid on the cliff-side... It then turns into the most boring imitation of National Treasure clue trailing we've ever seen, with yet another dumbfounding new character, the aged Jetfire, who is apparently some senile Decepticon who conveniently transferred allegiances for PERSONAL REASONS (WTF). Oh and he also has a cane and needs it apparently unlike Megatron who was frozen in ice for thousands of years. So he shares the story of the primes, who look just as bland and as boring as one another, who fought off the fallen AND WON, and so they being the all-powerful primes they are, decide the best way to safeguard an all-important artifact (matrix of leadership) from an immortal war-bot is to turn themselves into part of the Egyptian scenery. /facepalm. And what's the payoff? A terribly underwhelming ""climactic"" battle and an incompetent devastator who got owned in the face by one of the hillbilly auto-bots. Oh and a super buffed up Optimus who got powered up by the spare parts of the geezer-bot Jetfire.<br/><br/>***Other rants and complaints*** Soundwave could've used his old VA instead of the generic sounding and pretty much heard one/heard them all VO, a little tribute would've been nice since Megatron's was boring enough despite being voiced by Weaving. <br/><br/>Ravage could've had a better design than having just one eye?<br/><br/>We could've done without most of the college scene, the new Mexican sidekick who tasered himself, the military grunts and Turturro's ass shot. Actually they should've been scrapped altogether (WHERE WERE THE TEST AUDIENCES FOR THIS CRAP).<br/><br/>Why the hell was bumblebee still unable to speak when he already could at the end of the first one? That talking through the radio/lyrics thing was cute AT FIRST.<br/><br/>The robots fighting was novel in the first movie but now it just got old, really old.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime (After merging/powering up with Jetfire's parts/spark): Let's Roll *Flies off with his jet-pack* /facepalm who wrote the dialog for that.<br/><br/>It was an hour and 49 minutes? Jesus Christ it seemed like 2+hrs minimum. *** END RANT*** <br/><br/>Such a shame that the digital wizardry of ILM is wasted on this atrocity of a movie. Michael Bay should be dragged out a a back alley and thrown in the dumpster for what he's done. If there ever was a valid use for a time machine, it would be to stop myself from watching this. All I could ever think of while watching this (even the first one), was how much better I could have done it, and I would have if I could. *SIGH*<br/><br/>PLEA TO ZACK SNYDER: Please reboot the series maybe half a decade or so from now as I have complete faith in your adherence to the source material and will not deviate far (if at all) just to satisfy the masses.<br/><br/>You can: 1. Bring back Optimus' VA, and use Megatron's and Starscream's and definitely Soundwave's for the nostalgic touch.<br/><br/>2. Make the robots look less messy and junk-heap looking<br/><br/>3. Make Spike and Sparkplug actual mechanics instead of some Suburb Family.<br/><br/>4. Actually do justice to a gestalt by having it fight the auto-bots instead of John Turturro and the hillbilly-bots.<br/><br/>5. Many more but I need to go now (maybe I can edit this in the future but you get the gist)."
"Jinn","2","6","15","21 July 2009"," Revenge of the Fans
","Or at least it will be...Joining 'Death to you Michael Bay'FanClub. I stand by my review of TF1. Did this EarthGerm ever *watch* the show? See it for my views how characters should look & sound reminiscent of their 80's selves. Optimus still looks like Optimus, so iconic, even non TF fans know who he is. Surprised with Spielberg on the job the other robots didn't look better. *Very* disappointing. <br/><br/>I've mixed feelings. Let's start the other way around.<br/><br/>The Freaking Ugly... The Fallen grossed me out. Megatron & Starscream. AWESOME in G1, now look like Terminators Skynet never talks about. And WTF with Megatron's feet!? Thought Bay worried about 80's TF'S looking chunky. Needn't've bothered. They already do. G1 Megatron has big feet, but They're cool, nowhere near as ugly & chunky as in ""Fallen""...G1 Starscream actually had sex appeal! Optimus? I say again! Mouthplate, Bay, Mouthplate!! Must I beg like Starscream?! <br/><br/>The Baaaaaad & Stoopid: Devastator's whirlwind looked cheesy. Much voice-over work was disjointed. Optimus sounded different, not as good. Many characters-couldn't tell who's who, no intros, then they're blown up, sliced & diced before you even get to know them (Like poor Sideways...And Sideswipe was all cool about killing him? Some Autobot.) ""Revenge"" had more robots, but zilch character improvement. They even stuffed Optimus. Prime does NOT kill without a shred of remorse, or has no other alternative and even then wouldn't revel in it. I know Prime- don't blame him for bad scripting. Even in the first movie, he said he had no choice and called Megatron ""Brother."" Nor would Bumblebee crush Ravage, perhaps thump & render him sore & unconscious. Why do all 'bots that come alive with the All Spark turn into bad MF's? Again, where was Thundercracker? More robots, new ones, why not more originals? Took ages to get into the movie. Where were the promised Femmes? We see them speeding about, Arcee speaks once, then gets blown apart:( Their robot modes were silly, badly done as well. And Bay was worried about the G1 characters looking cheesy? The Blue one was Chromia, but I only found that out after when I saw the toy. Was the other meant to be Elita One, like the first movie toy? If so, nada mention of her & Optimus amor. Very disappointing on the Femme front. I don't count that Cyber-Slut, if it even was female. (But can I have that green dress...;) Bay seemed more interested showing off metallic testosterone, quite literally in Devastator's case. Idiotic fans say it was awesome & those looking for plot & good characterization should've looked elsewhere... A good movie by an *intelligent* director has ALL that and more. That's what the original had-So why can't TF movies have all that & then some like they should? Now THAT *would* have been AWESOME! These morons obviously have equal maturity to Bay, as someone said, a 12 year old ogling Play-Boy...PlayBot in this case & squealing like a cheesebot at Devastator's ""Decepticles,"" a fan put it, or giggling at Michaela's cleavage. Man if this was the first I'd ever seen of Transformers, no way I'd be so taken as back in the 80's. RotF left me cold, unsatisfied. Bay's movies have less charm than an enema. And what on Cybertron was with Megatron!? (At least they didn't go the Galvatron road) He didn't have the expected presence. Flailing about as a sappy lackey of the Fallen? WTF?! Sickening. If the REAL Megatron ever sees this, he'll fire Bay quite literally. 4 words: MEGATRON HAS NO MASTER.<br/><br/>The Good, Interesting & Funny: The Primes and their mission, that they'd been here before. Despite originals getting the sad Bay treatment, I liked some new characters, The twins were cool, more modern (for me it didn't seem racial, but I can see reading other reviews how it could be seen that way), the kid in me loved the cussing in a TF film...Jetfire, the crusty old dude was awesome- in keeping with how he switched sides as he felt more suited to the Autobots. (Even if different from Skyfire) I loved the story of the Tomb of the Primes, the Matrix, Sam's test, ancient symbols adding mystery, how they came to Egypt...I hope they rebuild that pyramid. (Gigantic robots in ancient places, y'know there's gonna be restoration in order. They still need to rebuild those Incan Pyramids from Energon...) Were the Pharaohs were inspired by the Fallen's headdress? Simmons got better, not such a dweeb, had a backbone after all. Sam's parents were more realistic. I loved Soundwave. Upon seeing the action figure, I feared the worst. What is it with Bay's obsession with the chunky 'gorilla' look? Despite looking different, Soundwave's calming voice worked, came across nice & clear and his satellite mode worked for the Communications Officer . (Frank's 'Dr Klaw' voice suited the darker demeanor, rather than Soundwave's melodical voice which mesmerised me. Well characterized, like in G1, in the background, running the show. Liked Ravage, very sleek. Bumblebee was cool, more grown up, awesome action scenes. And funny moments...Judy being ""Green,"" Resurrecting Prime with that 'pixie dust...' The twins' antics & Jetfire's ""Oh B0ll0CKS..."" He's quite a character and I'll miss him. Maybe Prime'll even forgive Bay-one of the soldiers said he weighed 10 tonnes. (He's actually 65 or was in G1;) Crash diet? (eep, pun sorry;) Car & jet modes cool. Transformers @ Midnight was awesome, too bad I wasn't 13;) Loved the interplay between Megatron & Starscream, very G1, taking me back, (even if short-lived & having to imagine them looking & sounding right)...So, I don't *completely* hate you, Bay;) The movies spawned new generations of TF fans & that's a good thing, even if you gotta tell 'em what the REAL Megatron is like;) Gods, I feel like Jetfire...'In my day, Sonny...' Hehe.<br/><br/>I hope the next one be better, if not, that's what fanfic/art & imagination be for."

","I have been a Transformers fan ever since the original cartoons. This movie was horrid. First off why so many references to drugs and sex. My 6 year old son really wanted to see this movie but because of the adult content I had to say no.<br/><br/>Read the other comments for details about the poor plot line, and the inability to figure out what exactly is going on in the scene.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the desperate attempt to add adult content. Do we really need mom getting stoned off a brownie? Dog humping, robots humping seriously, and why did Fox have to do a wardrobe change? It made absolutely no sense other than ""let have Fox do a strip tease"".<br/><br/>The icing on the cake was when Devistator (The big construction robot) was tearing apart the pyramid and the agent is ""below the ball sack"". And when the camera pans up you see two wrecking balls between the robots legs."
"Danterandal19","3","6","15","1 July 2009"," Their ""Revenge"" is Our Punishment
","Here is a film that knows not what the words ""excess"", ""story"" or ""entertainment"" mean. There are precious few moments that might be considered amusing to the average film-goer, a person who deserves much more than what is displayed here.<br/><br/>The ultimate defense by the fans of this film is ""But it's a Transformers movie? What did you expect?"".<br/><br/>As a huge fan of the first film,I'll tell you what I expected; I expected a plot, I expected characters to care about, I expected humor and action sequences that don't make my eyes and ears bleed. Lastly, I expected to be ENTERTAINED.<br/><br/>The human characters in this film don't act so much as they yell things and plot points. You'll hear a lot of ""Watch out"" or ""Look over there!"" or ""Run!"", but none of that makes for interesting character development. Not one single actor has a believable performance; it's always obvious that they're just shouting out horrendous dialogue from the script (with everyone's favorite Toe-thumbed hot chick Megan Fox being the worst offender). And the ""humor"" in this film is completely juvenile and unfunny. It's to the point where the Friedberg and Seltzer take on this script might actually prove a funnier, more tolerable movie.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the plot. Literally nothing makes any sort of sense in this film. How do toaster robots suddenly have built in guns- were they made like that already, just in case an Allspark shard would just so happen to make them come to life? Why does Shia have a cast on his hand off and on throughout the climax of the film? *Spoiler Alert* Why isn't the Allspark shard used to help Optimus Prime when it can resurrect Megatron in an instant? Why do robots disappear throughout the film only to reappear when *GASP* Sam is in danger of getting crushed by a Decepticon? I'm not even going to touch the whole thing about ""The Matrix"".<br/><br/>Yes, there are robots fighting, but good luck trying to decipher who's who. All you get to see is metal-on-metal- it's the equivalent of watching scrap parts from the dump having an orgy, and it's about as pleasing to the eyes and ears as such.<br/><br/>Where's the heart from the first film? That movie was just as dumb and poorly written as this one, but we CARED for the people in the 1st film. We wanted to see Optimus kick but and Shia get his girl. Here, all we have are a bunch of unnecessary humanoids palling around with idiotic robots in horrible set pieces that feature explosions whenever a Transformer looks at a building funny.<br/><br/>If that's what you want from a film, go right ahead. I'm just saying that we should expect more from dumb-ass big-budget blockbusters."
"jethomps-4","10","6","15","30 June 2009"," Excellently done for what it is meant to be
","I came away from this feeling like I saw a 2.5-hour-long live action Transformers G1 episode (80's elements aside). There can be no denying that this movie delivered exactly what its producers and director wanted it to deliver.<br/><br/>This IS a Sci-Fi/ACTION movie. You will not find depth of characters, deep emotional tugs or a real intricate plot, but that's not it's intended purpose. This is a fun, sit back in the movie theater with your popcorn and enjoy the visual spectacle kind of movie. And truthfully, that's where it matches the Generation 1 episodes, because aside from an elaborate advertisement for action figures, that's all it was.<br/><br/>I was pleased with the amount of Decepticon dialog in this film that the first one was lacking. Both sides of the fight get their just camera time and the action sequences (which are 90% of the movie) blow you away! And we don't get a good introduction to many of the robotic characters, but this is about all-out WAR! There's no time for introductions.<br/><br/>As for the comical moments, yeah, the first part of the movie went a bit over-the-top, but it worked out and was well placed later in the movie. Speaking of which, this movie IS rated PG-13, so if your kid is younger than 13, seriously consider whether or not they should see it as there are noticeable amounts of foul language and scenes that are a little risqué and others that are extremely violent or freaky."

"honorhorror","5","6","15","28 June 2009"," Enjoy the fireworks, 'cause if you take it as a film you can't save it from falling apart.
","Well, I am not gonna persuade you out of this, 'cause you'd see it anyway. I'd like to contribute this review to director Mr. Michael Bay, who may or may not have had authority to the final cut. Dear Mr. Bay, if you are reading this, I hope you may finally give us a better revised version. Sincerely.<br/><br/>Firstly, let's review some great qualities provided in the first Transformers. 1, organically entertaining script doesn't fall short of intelligence. The whole story flows smooth as a dream, with lots of lighthearted parts. We had time to develop emotions for Bumblebee and appreciate Optimus Prime and his nobility. Yet the movie had a clear and good message. 2, You know it's made-believe but you still can't believe they brought transformers alive in such details. It became our second nature to gaze and gasp in the whole 140 minutes. One time a robot, and that's the eye candy. 3, The movie never felt too lame to appreciate. Mr. Bay managed to put Jon Voight, Shia Laboef and John Turturro in the same shot, yet everyone still could hold true to their roles and make senses. In short, they don't pretend to be dumb. 4, A lot of chasing sequences definitely added dynamics to the movie, yet it's never confusing, meaning you know who's fighting whom.Every action sequence is long, consistent enough to enjoy.<br/><br/>Now let's see Revenge of the Fallen. 1, the first act worked. Congratulations.Autobots recruited some new members with goofy personalities, good. They help the world getting rid of decepticons, right.Sam's growing up and begin to have problems,wait. The family gigs still had a touch of its precedent. I had absolutely no problems with cheap jokes, but they feel sometimes long, distracting and overdone. The real problem is the lame undertone of its script. When all the fun on the screen get tired, audiences may wake up to find the ""Sam going to university"" story not a good exploration into the ""growing pains"" sub-plot.Wait, you are saying there is no such sub-plot? OK, play it your way Mr. Bay. Still, there's better ways to push the story forward to a conclusion that, Sam must rise and shine and save the earth with his punk charm again. I'd like to see Sam got bullied very often and still couldn't walk out of his halo as a big hero, which becomes a big barrier to his maturity. Maybe nowadays kids just can't even appreciate anything bittersweet, not to mention some real LOSS of the protagonist(s). If that's true, I sympathize with you, Mr.Bay.<br/><br/>2, 2nd act. Well, a lot of problems.Sam's college assassination is good;Prime's sacrifice is good. We saw some signals of apocalypse when decepticons arrived and Prime got killed. But the camera just can't drop from Sam and his sidekicks,spending too much time in making it a comedy. Since so much has been invested to create robots, why did you use them to slow down the movie instead of speed it up. In short, terrible pace and inconsistent plot development marred this act. After they arrived in Egypt, I was hoping the climax has some salvage value. My suggestion will be: Bumblebee need more time on the screen for the story to make sense, since many things are left for explanation.<br/><br/>3, the climax. Well simply the climax itself can make a full-length feature, if edited correctly. There are totally 3 plot lines involving all the robots in creation, but none of them had enough time to awe the audiences. We spent too much time listening to jokes and screams when we wanted to see autobots. The idea that US army defend Prime's remains with autobots is cool, but later we saw everything in a flash and couldn't tell who's fighting whom. If all the good guys and bad guys just get blown up so easily like dolls, who cares about them? In the precedent, Bumblebee tried to defend humans by holding up a truck but got his feet blown. That's something solid, which is needed here. This time it's Sam got blown and died for a few minutes until the spirits of Primes decided he's a good leader. That's OK, but it further dragged the movie into a cheap farce. ""Everyone has to be happy"" seems to be the goal of producers. But if those guys always got revived so easily and jump and kick in seconds, they are no longer flesh and bones. My take on this scene is slightly different: Sam got revived by the dust of ""Matrix"" but gained a little side effects--synchronizing his mind with the autobot he revives(that's to justify his authority). Therefore he could fight side by side with Prime, making the final battle more intriguing and emotional-involving. Although Prime got reconstructed and empowered, he's still losing in fighting Megatron and the Fallen. Although Sam could barely move after his injury, he acknowledged Prime of the weakness of the Fallen. Those surviving autobots also summed up a little more resistance to help Prime, showing their integrity and solidarity as good guys. After an epic battle, Prime finally defeated the Fallen. Later, Sam's injury needed more time to recover in the hospital, therefore his friends congratulated him for saving the world again and assured him that his growing pain can be overcome with friends and love. The astrology professor came for a visit too after he knows Sam's heroic deeds, and proposed to give him a special section in the hospital as gratitude. However, Sam declined. Later that night, Mikaella asked Sam about the names of the stars(or the fate of the universe), when they are on the balcony of Sam's ward. Mikaella was startled about Sam's profound knowledge in astrology. Sam explained it's Optimus Prime who taught him in their mind connection, and the camera showed Prime on the other side of the earth summoning more autobots. Then the credits rolls.<br/><br/>Well, just my idea. 5/10 means F for failed."
"Matt_Layden","5","6","15","28 June 2009"," Bigger, Louder, But Not Better
","So the film goes like this. Sam decides to put on his old shirt from the first film, when he takes it out, a piece of the cube falls out. He picks it up and it imprints a bunch of alien text into his brain. Anyways, bad robots are after this information, good robots must protect him, people run in slow motion, Megan Fox looks hot, someone wants to destroy the sun, they require help from robots so old they use walking canes and then Boom. Something explodes. This is Transformers in a nutshell. The film is so confused on what it's intentions are that it has to literally have one character ask the plot of the film from another. This actually happens.<br/><br/>A sequel to Transformers has to be bigger and louder, or else what would the point be right? Michael Bay seems to be an advocate of ""We Can Fix It In Post"" or ""We'll Throw Some CGI At It"". This is never a good sign and this film is a prime example. For starters, the film is too long. It has unnecessary scenes that do nothing for the film. Seeing Sam's mother on drugs for comedic relief is not funny, it's rather eye rolling. This is screen time that could have been giving to develop a bit more of a story, or been axed all together and shave of 20 minutes of failed comedy.<br/><br/>You simply cannot rely on Giant Robots Fighting as a draw for the audience. You need to give them substance, something this film lacks. For one, the main villain from the first one, good old Megatron, takes orders from some dude on a random planet. This guy is the ""Fallen"" and he returns to earth to destroy the sun, blah, blah, blah he has very little screen time. We don't feel the threat. Speaking of very little screen time, let's look at the main stars of this piece. No, not LaBeouf or Fox, the Autobots. The main reason this movie will make money is because of them and they get shafted hard here. Aside from Prime and Bumblebee, every other Autobot is basically background filler. With one key scene in the beginning, then nothing else. Why alienate the fan base that warranted a sequel in the first place. Oh wait, I forgot, they do focus on some Transformers. They are called the twins, speak jive, can't read and one has a gold tooth.<br/><br/>The entire film feels like Bay is just trying to out due himself. I can picture him on the set thinking how to make things seem bigger and more hectic, without giving a damn about the script. A script that is full of pages that read character jumps from explosion here, character runs from explosion there, character screams. But hey, what did I expect from a Bay flick right? Well, he did do The Rock and the first Transformers was really good. The final battle scene in that flick had more going for it, here I couldn't give a damn.<br/><br/>Megan Fox, sure she is hot, but can she act? Not if we are going on this performance. Her orange skin was distracting in the first flick, this time it's her big Jolie lips. Labeouf? His role consists of the aforementioned running and screaming. I didn't know who was who, a problem from the first film. The robots, now I consider myself to have basic knowledge of the Transformers universe. but I couldn't tell what was what unless they were specifically mentioned, like Starscream or Soundwave. I finally figured if I see a robot, it has to be an evil one because that's all they seemed to be focusing on. Where was Barricade? The cop car that mysteriously disappears from the first film before the climactic battle. I thought they would bring him back here and mention that, but nothing. Instead we get a 5 second cameo from Scorponok, the one who tunnels underground, before he gets lights out. There is a new character, who basically plays the role Anthony Anderson played in the first one, a tech geek. His only purpose is to re-introduce Turturro.<br/><br/>I wanted more from this film. We all know going into a Bay film we will get this, has he given up on giving us anything more? Has it been dumbed down to us guessing just how many explosions he will use in his films now? Too many, for this one. Giant robots fighting each other is cool, but we've seen it once. Is the only thing you're going to offer us is the same thing in a different setting? Change the city to a forest and some pyramids and it's all good? <br/><br/>In defense of the flick, the special effects are top notch, they are epic. They look great up on the big screen and that's where you should see this flick, if you have any interest at all. The big screen and loud sound was made for this flick. The fight sequences are interesting, even if the last one drags on too long. The idea behind the this film is good, the whole history and origins of the Transformers, but instead of diving deeper into that, they wanted to blow stuff up.<br/><br/>Too many characters (did we really need a robot chick who looked like she belonged in Terminator 3), too many robots (and the ones we actually care about are left for background filter), and an overblown and overly long film. This film could have been 20 minutes shorter. Transformers feels hollow inside. The first film had heart, this one is just dread. <br/><br/>It will please the target audience of teenage boys who want to see things blow up or Megan Fox run in slow motion. But for everyone else, it's just another summer blockbuster that is louder then the original"

","Leave it to Hollywood to ruin another potentially good plot and exciting story line by trashing this movie with bad language and a lot of sexual overtones. The first Transformers movie didn't have near as much bad language, but people still went to see it. This is so unnecessary, I don't know why producers feel they need to throw in profanity and sex in an action film in order to get an audience. I was embarrassed that I took my son to see this film. We should have got up and left.<br/><br/>Although there were a couple of funny moments in the movie, the script was so poor that the writers felt it necessary to fill time with bad ""one-liners"" to add more comic relief to the film. Ramon Rodriguez would have single-handedly brought down the entire film with his weak acting performance had this been a quality production. I still don't understand why his character was in the movie to begin with.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money at the theaters or the DVD release on this one. Wait until the network television premier if you really want to watch it."

","Wow... as a childhood fan of Transformers, I'm really without comment. Maybe it's easier to tell you what I saw and you can judge for yourself but SPOILERS ARE EVERYWHERE so if you care like I once did, skip to other User Comments, read the critics who actually get paid or, if you want to, see the darn movie yourself. For a Transformers movie, there was a helluva lot more actors than robots, especially this being a sequel there should have been more of everything. I laughed once during the whole movie and it had nothing to do with robots humping, dogs humping, strategically placed wrecking balls or brownies. The big explosion you read of in trivia is not a robot blowing up. Another thing I saw is that the same writers also wrote this year's hit reboot Star Trek also wrote this film, believe it or not. I think what really left me speechless though was both Devastator and the Fallen (supposedly the first Decepticon) both died like punks, instead of some awesome fight. And instead of throwing in some saving grace at the end credits, maybe a coming of Unicron to justify why I sat down for a minute shy of 150 I get... nothing. No end credit clip. Optimus saves the day, that's a wrap. The guys beside me fell asleep during the fight scenes for Christ's sake and so did someone's girlfriend in front... So yeah. Revenge of the Fallen? Nero put up a much better fight in Star Trek. And if Unicron doesn't arrive to eat Earth and not have a pathetic death like Megatron's 'master' after this, Transformers should be graciously laid to rest. Right now."

","Like bad action movies of the past with a big budget but no brain, (Can you say Reloaded? Can you say Revolutions? Can you now say Returns?) This movie pretends to be smart but ultimately there was no thought put into it on any level other then how to make different kinds of Robots look cool. Even the action scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. Again, the choppy CG was horid. The entire movie lacked real energy. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma. Since the movie tries to put some sort of emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as their setup and overuse flowed for far too long. Just like the Matrix sequels, this movie works as eye candy for a combined 15 minutes of its running time. The rest is crap."
"ste_shmoobert","6","6","15","24 June 2009"," Sadly disappointed
","Considering previous Michael Bay productions I was not expecting too much from the first film but was pleasantly surprised by its visual intoxication, with characters carefully charted throughout the film. Unfortunately Revenge of the Fallen's chemistry was severely unbalanced. The much adored battle scenes from the first movie were sadly not outdone for this sequel, instead they were just longer, louder and without creativity. I would not totally discredited this film as Shia la Boeuf's performance was yet again commendable. You could see the director was pushed for time as most of the battle scenes were shot in slow motion to add the more dramatic effect but after 9 or 10 of them it can get a bit tedious then eventually funny when it shouldn't be. But in respect I wasn't constantly watching the clock waiting for it to end, so I was entertained enough to sit through the length of this picture. But as a person who truly rates films on the premise that I could watch them over and over again, sadly this is not one of them."
"MFGrape","2","6","15","22 June 2009"," It will come out on DVD or somewhere on the net.
","I tried to like it. I gave the movie a pass whenever I could, but at some point I just had to acknowledge that this movie was terrible. <br/><br/>Anyway, let's move on to what really bothered me about this movie:<br/><br/>Let's talk about the soft core porn that this movie based on a children's animated series has become. Poorly delivered sexual robot innuendo, robot testicles, two dogs going at it twice in the early scenes of the movie, a robot mounting the chicks leg like some dog, constant shots of bouncing breasts and whenever possible the luscious curves of Megan Fox (goddess that she is)... I am glad I went to watch a movie that was either A.) trying to appeal to my inner adolescent in puberty or B.) blur the line between soft core and action. <br/><br/>Then there was the failure to yet again appeal to any of the fans of the original series. I won't complain too much about how the Decepticons still failed to look at all similar to their cartoon counterparts, but even telling them apart through all the action was a herculean task. The epic transformations were overdone. Making bumblebee into a pet rather than a kick @$$ robot, limited to no discussion of energon and cybertron (though they did more in this movie than in the former, so I guess that is a bit of an improvement), robots and space material that survive entering the earth's atmosphere yet crumbles into dust after a millennium, the obviously ""black"" illiterate robots, the overly important symbols that Sam could see but were never fully explained nor were they ever a problem after the first day of Uni, the Shard of whatever that just suddenly came to life, robots everywhere in disguise, the robots were part organic and born out of Matrixesque womb pouches, the role of humanity -as if guns could stop an alien robot- and so on. <br/><br/>The list of complaints goes on. If you just want to watch things blow up it is excels, so I gave it a two. But, if you actually watched the animated series as a fan and have some taste in movies, this movie fails. It took every ounce of strength I had to keep me from mocking it the entire time or simply walking out. Especially when the elder robots sent Sam back to Earth as he was the Ring Bearer."
"BoilerUp","1","8","22","25 June 2009"," Interesting plot ruined by horrible writing and pointless sequences
","This movie was disappointing on so many levels. The plot for the most part was interesting, but the awful writing and many pointless scenes ruined the film. The sequences with the dogs humping were utterly pointless. They were humorous, but pointless. I didn't pay to see this movie to see dog sex; I wanted to see robots and humans battling it out. Instead the audience receives about an hour's worth of terrible lines (what is up with the transformers' overuse of expletives? It stopped being funny after the second time.), and pointless scenes that do nothing to advance the plot (like the mom getting high and running around campus). I give movies a chance that receive a poor score on rotten tomatoes, especially when so many people on IMDb have rated it highly. Apparently most viewers have a much lower expectation of what they want from a movie they pay $10+ to see. If there is a SE DVD (shortened edition) that removes all the pointless refuse from this film I may consider renting it once. This movie disappointed me so much I had to stay at the theater and see Star Trek again to renew my appreciation for quality cinema. Do yourselves a favor, expect nothing but trash when you go to the movie and you're sure to not be disappointed."
"ParanoidAndroid97","1","5","12","12 April 2013"," Soulless action film based on the dullest war since, er... Transformers 1
","Don't bother seeing this. Instead, step inside a car crusher. When you have come out, flattened like a pancake and impaled by various pieces of scrap-metal, you will have had the same experience that I had when I watched this movie. Transformers 2 is a sequel that, like the original, is based on a war between two robot races: the Autobots (the 'good' guys) and the Decepticons (the 'bad' guys). The only problem is that you can barely tell which is which- they're just giant machines beating each other up. With the exception of Optimus Prime (who I like just because his name is awesome) you don't identify with any of the robots in the movie, the only character with any individuality whatsoever being Sam Witwicky, a character saved by the charisma of young actor Shia LaBeouf (of 'Holes' fame). Other than that, I simply can't find anything to like about this movie at all. In fact, even director Michael Bay didn't like it, and neither did LaBeouf, who thought, rightly, that they had sacrificed the key relationships in the movie for more robots fighting. And if the principle actor and the director thought it sucked, I believe I have every right to give this movie 1/10."
"MBunge","2","5","12","28 May 2010"," I'd rather watch a marathon of ""Ow! My Balls!""
","Of all the Michael Bay movies that have ever been produced, Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is by far the Michael Bay-iest. It's 153 minutes of him ejaculating his essence into viewers' faces.<br/><br/>In the two years since the first Transformers movie, the Autobots and Earth's military forces have worked together to track down and destroy Decepticon invaders (Those are both armies of giant robots that change shape into vehicles, for those of you that missed the first movie or any of the cartoons or toys that have been around since the 1980s). This little war has been going on in secret and they've been hiding the existence of all alien robots from the public. How this didn't all get out after that huge battle devastated downtown Los Angeles in the first film is just one of many, many, many, MANY obvious questions this story avoids like the plague.<br/><br/>Anyway, after a ludicrously over-the-top action scene that might as well have been filmed with a kaleidoscope for all the sense it makes, a dying Decepticon mentions something called ""The Fallen"". None of the Autobots know what to make of this because apparently all Transformer history and knowledge was stored in that giant cube from the first film and was lost when it was destroyed. Yeah, that's right. A civilization of giant robots has no back up memory files. Not even a flash drive or something burned onto a DVD. And that's not even close to being the stupidest thing in this film.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), who saved the world from the Decepticons in the first movie, is going to college. He's going to school on the East Coast and leaving behind his incredibly hot girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) and his Autobot protector Bumblebee. Apparently there were no closer schools he could attend so Sam could stay near his incredibly hot girlfriend and, I guess, having a giant robot around to do whatever you want must get old after a while. While Sam is leaving for college, he finds a piece of the giant cube from the first movie. He gives it to Mikaela for safekeeping, but not before it zaps his brain with a bunch of alien data. For the next hour-and-a-half of this movie, Sam and Mikaela don't tell anyone they have this cube shard and seem to even forget they have it, despite all common sense and that fact the shard would have been vitally useful at several different moments. And no, that's not the stupidest thing in this film.<br/><br/>To cut a long and garbled plot down to size, the Decepticons located a giant machine on Earth thousands of years ago that could provide them with energy by destroying the Sun. They need a special Autobot key to make it work and it's basically a race between the good guys and the bad guys to see who gets to the machine and the key first. There are other twists and turns in the rest of Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen, but since Michael Bay just uses it all as pretexts for explosions, I don't think I need to get into it.<br/><br/>This is not just the worst movie I've seen. It goes beyond that. This is the worst piece of entertainment of any kind that I've ever experienced. It make Vanilla Ice sound like Mozart. It makes Ed Wood look like John Ford. It makes The Diary of Desmond Pfeffer feel like Seinfeld. This thing is such an assault of noise and blur and idiocy that I became physically uncomfortable watching it. Imagine the worst moment in the worst Michael Bay movie you've ever seen. Now imagine something twice as bad and repeated at least 100 times. That's what Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is like.<br/><br/>Even in the totality of its terribleness, there are certain elements of this movie that are particularly foul and insulting. There is a lot of profanity in it, much more and much harsher than you expect in this type of summer blockbuster, making it really inappropriate for younger children. It also takes the most basic concepts of space and time and chucks them out the window. There are several instances where I would defy anyone to explain how the characters get from point A to point B. The movie also casts President Obama as some sort of simpering weakling, which apparently indicates that Michael Bay is a Dittohead.<br/><br/>Let me conclude this review by stating that you should believe every criticism anyone makes about this movie. If anyone tells you Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is good, you should punch that person in the stomach and run away. The only human being who could get any satisfaction out of watching this film is Mike Judge. That's because the existence of this movie and its success at the box office proves just how prophetic Idiocracy really was."

","Could have been better ... a lot better, their ruin the Transformers franchise. What were they thinking. So, if you like the characters created in the first movie; if you like stories; if you would like at least that you ears and/or you intelligence don't be hurt by the most stupid lines ever told by a human (or robot) in a movie, be careful with this movie.<br/><br/>But, if you want to see a lot of spare parts fighting each other, would like to see great battles, don't care for story, dialogues or continuity, you'll sure like this one, because it has great battle scenes, bigger and faster than the first one. Then, maybe you'll give and 8 instead of a 2 to Revenge of the Fallen. Myself, i like that action scenes be part of the movie, not the movie itself.<br/><br/>And, with how much money this movie is making, I am too afraid of Transformers 3. Because THERE WILL BE a third one. Bigger than this one. Maybe they'll add the Transformer Planet Unicron, who maybe could try to destroy earth itself. I'm sure Michael Bay's eyes would spark thinking about a giant hand smashing Manhattan, while it's leg sink in the pacific and destroys Japan with a Tsunami.<br/><br/>So, be careful with the movie. Don't get any higher expectations except some time to eat popcorn."

First thing that comes to mind is how they screwed up the matrix of leadership. It's not some blade you stab into Optimus Prime. The matrix of leadership is inside his chest plate. Arcee is not 3 motorcycles she is one. One pink motorcycle. Bumblebee isn't some kick ass auto bot. Anyone who has ever seen the original transformers knows this. I mean the cartoons not the first load of donkey turd Michael Bay put out. None of the transformers say a bad word but in this junk they seem to love them. Optimus Prime is a bad ass but he is equal to Megatron. This pile of gorilla snot has Prime taking on Megatron and 3 other evil robots (they won't let me write their names on this post). Come the hell on. Speaking of Gorillas, Michael ""ruin childhood memories"" Bay decided it was cool to make Devastator look like a damn gorilla. This isn't beast wars. Plus it took what about 13 construct icons to make him. On top of that he gets killed by humans while climbing a pyramid. Too king Kong if you ask me. Story line was whack, focused too much on the humans which was stupid, evil robots (they won't let me write their name on this post) die to easily. The first movie was bad but come on.

","I find it amusing that some people are saying this movie lacked plot and that the CGI was too blurry. Perhaps because I saw it in IMAX my opinion of the effects is nothing short of WOW!!! AS for the plot, it not only had a solid one, in my opinion, it tied in nicely overall with the first movie. I'm not going to give any spoilers. I don't need to, the movie can be recommended without any. First of all, I feel it made a logical step in what Earth would likely be like 2 years after the first movie. Familiar characters from the first movie were back in logical ways (versus, ""Hey let's just throw THIS character in from the first movie for fun!""), it was explained quite effectively in the opening narration everything we needed to know to understand everything that was to follow. The story (or PLOT, as some seem to feel was missing) was actually layed out in THE FIRST THREE MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. If you simply watch and listen to the first few minutes, you'll see it all fall into place throughout the movie as more gets explained. The effects were spectacular! Some even had me catching myself with my mouth wide open (SERIOUSLY!) The personalities of the various Autobots, in my opinion, was refreshing. You had personalities ranging from goof-balls, to show-offs, to ""military"" serious, to playful-yet-hardcore. Which is actually what you would find in ANY U.S. Military Platoon filled with guys who've worked together for the last 2 years. <br/><br/>The main story, though not FULLY explained from A to Z, gave enough detail to keep things flowing without making your brain hurt from too many details. Yes, I did find a couple of scenes out of place (a couple of scenes are in ""high octane"" mode, yet cut away to a much calmer scene that is not connected in any way to the scene we just saw, only to cut back to the ""high octane"" scene"" again) which is why I took away one of the stars. I removed another star because, as kick @ss as the climatic scene was, it should have lasted longer for all the build-up leading to it.<br/><br/>Oh, and personally, I actually grew to really like Bumblebee in this movie (was NOT a fan of his in the first movie!) He was as goofy as in the first movie, but in my opinion he showed he was a worthy dude to have on your side when some serious....um...""stuff"" hits the fan.<br/><br/>The graphics rocked. The story flowed. And ultimately, I feel it surpassed the first movie. Again, I saw it in IMAX, so that might be the3 best way to truly experience this movie.<br/><br/>That's My Opinion, But You're Welcome To It."
"ric_dem","Null","5","12","28 June 2009"," Pretty bad..
","I feel like I got tricked again. I really didn't care for the first Transformers movie much, but I assumed, like most people, Michael Bay uses criticism to improve and move on to the next project and do it better with this new found knowledge. But, with Transformers 2 some was improved, but a lot was just plain bad. The first hour was painful.. Terrible dialogue, many many innuendos, a set of twin Autobots that were equally annoying as Jar Jar Binks from Star Wars, awkward plot movement, and just plain bad writing. The first hour felt like it was written by a 40 something who is completely out of touch with the audience they are trying to reach, trying to write a story that will touch that age group with dialogue that will be relevant to them.. and it failed very badly. And please, do not take any children to this movie. It is given a PG-13 rating, but I wonder about that. Not only do you get see a robot that has testicles, but also you get to hear many profanities used by robots for seemingly no good reason other than they are supposed to sound ghetto. Also sex is eluded to with Megan Fox in pretty much every scene she is in. This seems to be her only function in this movie.<br/><br/>The last hour and a half wasn't so bad. I started to notice a difference around the time the main characters go to meet John Turturros character. From there on, the story gets pretty good, the action is non stop, and the Autobots get some pretty cool gear.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 50%. Don't pay to see it. Wait for a friend to get it on DVD, and even then it still may not be worth your two and a half hours that you could be doing something else."

The action is excellent..with tons of explosions and more fight scenes than part 1. While the movie is a tad long, it is a good watch and it's always exciting to see the 'bots transform. Shia does a very good job and is believable as he helps the audience to feel his difficulty leading a 'normal' life while there is an alien war going on that he can't avoid. Meagan Fox is wonderful on the eyes but she needs to work on her acting. Optimus Prime and Bumblebee stole the show in my eyes...again and it's clear Michael Bay is highlighting their heroic acts..and the audience in my cinema loves it. I will always remember the cheers in both installments when Prime first takes the screen. Bumblebee believes in Sam and will always be there to protect him. It's a toss up which one is better...but action wise, Revenge of the Fallen wins. If you enjoyed part 1, I don't see why you wouldn't enjoy this installment.

I thought they kind of rushed the beginning scenes because the movie was already 2.5 hrs long, and truthfully I wish the whole movie was longer. It seemed like they rushed too much and could have put in a lot more, for example, the bad guys could have caused a lot more damage to humans and big cities like NYC. I'm also glad there were more scenes with the soldiers. Thank god Megan Fox is so damn gorgeous because her acting isn't the best but Shia rocks. Third film is a definite possibility.

","Take it for what it is...a sci-fi summer blockbuster, and you can't say much bad about this movie. Shia LeBouf is as goofy as ever. John Tuturro is as neurotic as ever. Megan Fox is hotter than ever (is that even possible?). And Michael Bay blows up more stuff than ever. There's nothing not to like,aside from the annoying Autobot twins (this movie's version of Jar-Jar Binks). Even the one plot hole that I found was quickly resolved in a post-screening discussion. If you're going to hate on this movie for its lack of substance, then I think you're taking the wrong view of it. Well worth waiting in line for the midnight screening, and that's even disregarding the trailer for ""The Last Airbender"". Now I think it's time to hit up the IMAX. Should be even more amazing there."
"komanche10","8","5","12","24 June 2009"," Easily a Summer Blockbuster
","Okay so here it is, the movie a vast majority of fans have waited for, whether to see if it would be a major disaster or a major hit depended on the fan. After seeing this movie last night, and I will admit I was a little hesitant about going, I am happy to say that it was not bad.<br/><br/>From reading previous reviews that made it sound as if the one-liners and comedy killed the movie while the plot did not advance I was skeptical as to how well this movie was actually going to do. However I have found most of these claims to be false. While the movie is loaded with one-liners, for the most part they are well placed and do add a comic relief for the current situation. While it did seem that the plot back tracked on occasion, mainly due to the number of characters they had to follow, it did move at a relatively even pace. Although I do want to say that a key part of the movie was very obviously not the end of a character's life and it foreshadowed greatly what was going to happen in the later part of the movie.<br/><br/>And in typical summer blockbuster (and Michael Bay fashion) there were enough fighting scenes and explosions to make any action movie fan's head spin, but they were well choreographed scenes and I bow down before all of the techs that had to plan out every move the auto-bots and decepticons had to make. While sometimes the scenes seemed crowded with action they were well shot and sequenced so that the audience was not to overwhelmed.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a great movie for anyone that is looking for that summer action packed film. Yes it may have its flaws, but the overall package is a fun watch for those that don't want to be obsessively correcting everything the writer, director, or actors may or may not have done wrong.<br/><br/>Enjoy the film! ~K~"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","7","5","12","24 June 2009"," If you only see one movie this year about giant killer robots...
","Possibly make it this one. I haven't seen Terminator Salvation, so I can't compare the two, but I think it's safe to say that NO movie this year (so far) would have as many giant robots or fights *between* giant robots as this one had. Oh, and explosions. There's SO many explosions in this movie, I lost count (same goes for the amount of Transformers in this film). Take what was in the first movie, then triple it (or even quadruple it!). Say what you will about Michael Bay, but he knows how to blow stuff up (on an EPIC scale). If you want tons of action and robots beating the snot out of each other, than look no further than this film. You shan't be disappointed.<br/><br/>For those of you seeking a bit more than mindless action, however...well...there's humour at least! Yes, the movie retains the humour that made the first film so great. The laughs are still one of the strong points in the movie (thankfully, most of them are intentional). Though, it must be said, there are occasions where the humour seems aimed at children. The prime example being a couple of dimwitted robot ""brothers"", Skids & Mudflap, who perform numerous pratfalls. They're annoying for the majority of the film, but do get one or two good lines here and there. If Frenzy (who turned into a CD-player/Mikaela's phone in the first film) annoyed you, get ready for multiple tiny little irritating robots this time around. Most of note is Wheelie (a remote control monster-truck who's like a nasty WALL-E in robot form). While he IS pretty irritating, the back and forth between him and Mikaela makes for some good laughs (I cheered her on when she destroyed his eye with a mini blowtorch). Also, perhaps appropriately, she makes him her bitch (quite *literally* - he's reduced to the equivalent of a Chihuaha in a handbag...well...technically a box). Anyone who debated Frenzy's swearing when he ""died"" in the first film should be delighted with the amount of Transformers cursing in this one (and look out for Frenzy's head cameo).<br/><br/>As I said, there's too many Transformers to keep track of (including three female motorcycles and an old geezer complete with robot-beard). Probably the most memorable is Devastator, who's formed when seven 'Constructicons' combine (this one really sucks...up sand and anything else that gets in its way, chews them up, then spits their bits out its back). While the new robots are varying degrees of successful, it's the old favourites that prove the most enjoyable to see. Both Optimus Prime and Bumblebee get to kick major robot ass in this film (Optimus proving why he's the leader/the best). Megatron's resurrection, however, doesn't seem to amount to much by the film's end (though at least there's more of him and Starscream arguing like an old married couple than in the first).<br/><br/>As for the humans - who I personally felt were about equal to the Transformers (as far as their roles were concerned) in the first movie - they are more than a little bit overshadowed in this one. That isn't to say Sam, Mikaela and Lennox take a backseat. They're featured in this movie, all with decent screen time. Even Sam's parents - who, again, prove equal parts annoying/amusing (especially his mum) - get their fair share. Too bad if you find them unbearable. John Turturro is back as Agent Simmons (also voicing old-man-bot, Jetfire), but pulling for the good guys now. Speaking of he-who-got-peed-on-by-Bumblebee-in-the-first-movie, the mysterious and over-bronzed Alice (Isabel Lucas, who's doing pretty well for herself considering she comes from Aussie soap, Home & Away) is the poor victim of Bumblebee's ""lubricating"" this time around. Good old Bumblebee - you can always count on him. Not only does he let loose with green pee in her face, but when Sam comes dangerously close to cheating on his girlfriend (and, really, what man in his right mind would cheat on MEGAN FOX?!), Bumblebee calls him on it and plays various appropriate songs and lets Alice know she - and her wicked tongue - aren't welcome inside him.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf's Sam and Megan Fox's Mikaela are as likable as they were in the first film. Despite what certain people think, these two characters help ground the movie and keep it from getting too unbelievable (although it does verge on ludicrous a couple of times - one instance being when Sam is seemingly in Transformer Heaven or wherever and gets resurrected by...pixie dust). Mr. Fergie (aka Josh Duhamel) seems slightly less important in this film as Lennox, but least he's there as one of Sam's allies. It's Sam and Mikaela, though, whose journey we follow - and what a journey it is! Among other things, there are several references to current goings on (President Obama, swine flu, etc) and Linkin Park, as well as Green Day, music is heavily featured. While I probably prefer the first film, this one isn't too shabby either. It probably could've done without being two and a half hours long, though."
"sgone30","9","5","12","20 June 2009"," Spectacular
","Transformers: The Revenge of the Fallen is a spectacular special effects movie from start to finish. The movie also has a number of comic moments, from wisecracking ""Autobots"" to hilarious moments with the Witwicky family on campus to name but a few.<br/><br/>Michael Bay has added many more Transformer robots to the second movie to beef up the action even more than the first film (if that was at all possible). There is even a Transformer satellite and a Transformer who is ""Terminatoresque"". The Transformer Mythos is explored more in this film and Bay's effective use of using the real military in the previous movie is once again well utilised especially with the scenes shot on the John C Stennis (US Aircraft Carrier) to give real authenticity.<br/><br/>Bay has also stuck to his usual style of cramming as much action and mayhem as you can into a movie which is either a treat or makes you think that perhaps there is too much of a good thing but that's down to personal choice? Plus, his trademark 360 degree pans are alive and well in this film.<br/><br/>Despite comments to the contrary, the acting is well done. Shia LaBeouf and John Turturro are fine actors/comic actors and the rest of the cast give a fine support. The acting performances may appear a little fragmented in parts but this is because of Bay's ethos of cramming of much action as possible into 2hrs 30 mins.<br/><br/>Megan Fox looks as gorgeous as ever and also has a rival in the beauty stakes in the form of Isabel Lucas. Lucky old Sam Witwicky! The movie is what is says on the tin. An action SFX packed Summer Blockbuster which won't disappoint!"
"SamiCybertron","3","5","12","20 June 2009"," Wow...just Wow!!
","After seeing the first film back in 2007, I was all geared for a sequel. Now here we are in 2009 with TF: Revenge of the fallen, All I can say is just...Wow, the movie was just pure perfection and everything I was expecting, new characters, lots of explosions, outstanding special effects and great battles from our beloved robots in disguise.<br/><br/>Plot wise I cant really complain all that much since I have seen quite a handful of negative reviews saying that this film's plot is abit dry, but I think the plot is decent for all can be expected.<br/><br/>The Transformers themselves always seem to be perfectly made in CGI and once more the voice actors give there outstanding performances, Great to hear Peter Cullen as Prime & Hugo Weaving as Megatron, also great to hear Frank Welker (the voice of Megatron & Soundwave in the original series) make his big break into the film series as the beloved Soundwave again.<br/><br/>Also Megatron & Starscream bring there infamous squabbling into the movies and it's done perfectly to no end and Megatron has more lines in this film ^_^ Then we move onto The Fallen (who is voiced by Tony ""The Candyman"" Todd), a character who appeared mainly in the War Within Comic and let me just say he is a great character who means serious business. Originally there was a rumour that Lenord Nimoy was gonna play him which would have been nice, but I think Todd was a much better choice. Sorry Nimoy.<br/><br/>Also some characters like Sideswipe, The Constructicons, Arcee, Wheelie & Jetfire (who is now a cranky, old coot ^^) make there first theatrical appearance and they finally managed to make this film more focused on the robots than the human characters.<br/><br/>There arn't really any flaws that stand out in this movie that much except for Sam's Parents & Leo, I don't even know what they are doing in this film to begin with.<br/><br/>Overall though, this film was simply beautiful. Truly everything that a sequel should be with so much heart and motion from all the cast with 100% outstanding special effects! As a die-hard Transformers fan I will say this now, Ignore the negative reviews now! This film is a cinematic masterpiece!! If your a fan of Transformers or just getting into it, Go see it now!!!"
"dave_r_Green-1","9","5","12","20 June 2009"," You get more of what you want
","Lets face it. You do not want to watch transformers for acting ability or a contrived twisted gripping plot. You want to pay your money to watch twenty foot robot's have a giant mechanical deathmatch, pulling some sweet moves and get blown away by all the action. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen delivers on all of this plus more.<br/><br/>The movie again is packed full of humour and of course the delectable Megan Fox returns for a different kind of visual treat.<br/><br/>What I like about transformers is that its not trying to be serious, it isn't trying to come across as something it isn't. It is immense fun to experience and a beauty to watch.<br/><br/>Hardcore fans will be pleased by some of the touches made, Soundwave, and Ravage were particular favourites of mine, the Constructicons, Matrix of Leadership, and Jetfire are all up there too.<br/><br/>Personally, I didn't notice the length much, and anyone who enjoys transformers won't notice too. Go do yourselves a favour people, buy a ticket, get your popcorn and settle down for a fantastic funny time."

The fallen is exactly what we've all been waiting for.....bigger battles, bigger auto-bots and decepticons and it blows you away a lot more than the first movie. They only thing i would say about it is that it gets quite boring in parts, a movie like this needs to stay big, either be entertain you, make you laugh or make your heart beat and there are a few times in this when you yawn. But.....it is so worth it to sit through the boring parts because when it gets big it is unbelievable! It delivers exactly what a movie like this(a Michael bay movie) is supposed to deliver!

There were more transformers which I wanted but not many Autobots just decepticons with no back stories or names and this really disappointed me. There were a lot more fights in this film compared to the first one which again was good but since the first one i felt the scenes could of shown more of the autobots and stop keep going back to the humans. I know I'm not a director but i think the fight scenes could have been more from a far so your able to see whats going on a little better.

"panjshir_lion","1","7","19","28 June 2009"," You got what you paid for - eye candy
","OK, the movie isn't a 1/10 but I just 'had to do it' to push down the overall ranking. I'd say the special effects, good acting, canned laughter, and well laid out story line bring it up to at least a 5/10.<br/><br/>Honestly, there isn't really much to say about this film, it's just like all of the other big summer action block busters designed to transform (er dumb down) our brains and let us just sit back and enjoy the eye candy. With the seamless special effects, the smoking hot actress, and non-stop action, this movie delivers in spades.<br/><br/>Though you have to wonder how the industry is producing these types of movies - in other words, they are forced to dumb down and play safe bets. This was a big budget film and hence had to see big profits to turn around the costs - perhaps ironically at our expense.<br/><br/>Both Transformers movies have a quality - they take us back to our childhoods. My problem with this was I felt more like a fool instead of child by prescribing to any of it. Between dealing with the movie-zombie packed parking lot (weekday late night), the Facebookers raving reviews, the audience laughing at the dumbest one-liners, human emotions of the robots (including dry humping), the low IQ 'jive' Negro robots, etc etc. developed a very obnoxious social meme around this film. Call me high flatulent, but this was simply too much for me to take, or accept."
"ParagraphPresident","2","7","19","20 June 2009"," Horrible in every sense.
","Dismal. Just dismal. Incomprehensible both visually and narratively, devoid of characterisation with a script that might be the worst of the year. And completely over-sexed, which is a pretty weird direction to go in for a film about asexual alien robots. Somehow offensive and boring at the same time. None of the actors involved get away without embarrassing themselves, and the handful of robots who have any kind of personality are horrible racial stereotypes. Others have invoked the name of Jar Jar Binks in reference to this movie, and if you're masochistic enough to go and see it you'll realise why. And, painfully juvenile, the film also has a dirty mouth, likely the explanation for the 12a rating here in the UK. It's not for kids. Just really stupid adults."
"chainborne","3","7","19","19 June 2009"," A disappointing rehash of the first film, only not as good.
","I'm not a rabid Transformers fanboy by any means, but I'm annoyed by the other reviews on here which seems to think that a coherent plot and decent characterisation are too much to expect from a film based on such a rich milieu, with a quarter-century of continual development and storytelling to draw upon.<br/><br/>After the (decent) establishing work done in the first film to create an emotional connection with these giant alien robots, I had hoped they'd be allowed to carry the next film on their own merits, and have some character development of their own. Instead we got Part 2 of ""The Amazing Adventures of Sam Witwicky"" in which Sam once again comes to possess the secret location of some-vital-thing, and is chased around by a bunch of interchangeable Decepticons, while most of the Autobots now seem content to merely lend fire-support to the US Military.<br/><br/>Although several established Transformers make appearances in this film (Soundwave, Ravage, Arcee, The Constructicons/Devastator, amongst others), no attempt is made to personalise them or give them individual motivations. Optimus Prime on the other hand displays an uncharacteristic level of savagery in his combat scenes, disembowelling Decepticons and tearing their faces off with abandon. Megatron meanwhile is entirely irrelevant to the film, merely the ""apprentice"" of The Fallen, a 2-dimensional stock villain of the cheapest sort; the Decepticons bafflingly willing to carry out his nonsensical agenda.<br/><br/>*sigh* It's got cool robots in it, stuff blows up in an exhilarating way, and Megan's boobs look nice in slo-mo. It's just a shame they didn't have the confidence to let the robots take the lead this time round, or make the effort to come up with a less ridiculous plot."

","Transformers 2 is the worst film i have ever seen. sure, there are films that have worse production, like Birdemic or After Last Season but that is part of the reason why Transformers 2 is just so horrenoudsly bad. although it cost 200 million dollars and looks very pricey, it still manages to be a worse film then Birdemic or The Room. The movie is very racist! I am black and i found the two robot twins extremely racist. they rap, they have gold chains and teeth, they cant read or swim, and one of them even asks if a KFC is open??? Racist! The cinematography is also really bad, because the camera is often way to shaky to see anything, the camera angles cut off the top of peoples heads, and the only 2 colors in this crappy movie are teal and orange. Everyone in the movie looks like they belong on Jersey Shore, LOL! there is even a scene were Shia's mom runs around a college classic ""stoned"" on ""weed"", and it goes on for like 5 minutes!!! WTF, WHO FINDS THIS FUNNY!??!?!? it suddenly turns into a Family Guy sidegag, and the weed isn't even realistic. weed makes people chill and relaxed, sometimes even sleepy, but this movie shows her jumping on people and screaming and flailing her arms in the air, like the EXACT OPPOSITE of what weed does. not that middle schoolers would know that, tho they probably would tell you they inject weed all the time.<br/><br/>Like every 13-year-old white douche-bag cliché is here for a film to have. random F-bomb that has no context? check. hot chicks everywhere? check. popular soundtrack with Greenday, Hollywood Undead, gangsta rap, and Lincoln Park? check. like a million stupid explosions? check. more hot chicks? check. cliché thug stereotypes? check. weed and pot references (that aren't even realistic)? check. bro side characters using ""Cool"" slang? check. cool cars in car chases? check. dogs humping?...idk, are pre-teens into that kind of thing? um, well Michael Gay sure thinkgs so.

"craigmoore-3","Null","3","6","24 October 2009"," Not a bad follow up overall. About 10-15 minutes too long.
","Firstly, if you have not seen this film yet, and plan to do so, do not listen to these people who rate this film between 1-4/10, it is certainly not that bad, and I think that those people were never going to like it no matter how good or bad the film was. But on the other hand, don't listen to the people who are giving it 9-10/10, because there is no way it is that good either.Just a tip for those who plan on seeing it in the near future.<br/><br/>This film is set 2 years after the previous installment,and it involves the return of Decepticon forces to Earth to take revenge after their defeat in the first film,so Sam,Mikaela,Optimus Prime and the rest of the Autobots prepare for a second battle, and the revelation that an ancient evil is about to take his revenge.<br/><br/>OK, first of all, this film is definitely not as good as the first film for 3 reasons.<br/><br/>Reason 1 : The film is too long. The final battle in the desert seems to go on a long time.Many areas of the film could have been trimmed down a couple of minutes.<br/><br/>Reason 2 : The story unravels at too much of a slow pace, and has too many elements.First we are talking about the Fallen, then it switches to the Matrix of Leadership, then on to the Sun Harvester. Now don't get me wrong, if you have half a brain in your head you won't find this too complicated, but it still seems like too much is going on, and towards the end you feel yourself stop caring.<br/><br/>Reason 3 : TOO MANY ROBOTS! There are an abundant number of them in this movie, and I know some people might feel that it is a stupid thing to give out about considering it is a Transformers movie, but just try remembering all the names right after you walk out of the cinema.Yeah good luck with that. There must be like 30 of them, compared to the 10 or so previously.<br/><br/>On the upside, the action is brilliant and the film has the best special effects of any film this summer.

","I won't deny, i was looking forward to seeing this movie. I saw it before all the reviews were released, and still retained some shallow belief that Michael Bay could genuinely produce a decent sequel to his pretty damn good Transformers of 2007...I was wrong...Two hours and god knows how many minutes wrong! The plot: Megatron's dead (hurrah), Optimus and the Autobots are kickin' Decepticon ass (hurrah)...Sam is still going out with Megan Fox (yawn), Sam's going to college (even bigger yawn), Sam meets a new roommate, who appears to be extremely arrogant, self-involved, whilst still being a mega-geek with no friends (cue sticking rusty nails in eyes).<br/><br/>This could have been a strong plot, and really could have made an exhilarating thrill ride, immersing the audience deeper into the Transformers universe. However, instead this is sacrificed for cheap gags and sentimental crap, which we've seen a thousand times before! And may i add, done a thousand times better! I felt the same at the beginning of the movie about Sam and Mikaela's relationship as i did at the end i.e. i couldn't give a fiddler's f**k who says ""I love you"" first! Yes, it was necessary for Sam to move on, and it was only natural to have him in a university environment. But why spend so much time in the build up of him going to College, and then have him spend 5 minutes there before he becomes a fugitive? I wanted to see more of College life, or at least a mahoosive fight there between Bumblebee and that crazy bitch. But no, all we get is one lecture, one dorm scene, one frat party scene, and one alien with a tail trying to kill him sex scene.<br/><br/>Sam's parents are comic relief, and it was good to see a bit more of them. His mum and dad add a bit of much needed humour. For that, it gets a star. However, why not just leave it at that? Why milk everything for a cheap laugh; even to resort to Transformer testicles and dogs humping one another!?! The character of the Fallen, the so-called angel of death is rather diluted as a villain, who adds very little, and does very little to eclipse Megatron's villainy. It seemed as though Bay was buying time with the whole ""I can't go to earth, because Prime will kill me"" speech, and instead seemed that he had been given a villain, and had no idea how to use him effectively. So, kept him dormant for the duration.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are not unimpressive, but rather really confused. In the final battle, i struggled to tell the difference between good guys and bad guys. It was a shame Bay didn't utilise the massive landscape more effectively, as one of the faults of the final showdown in the prequel was the rather compact battlefield. However, the forest fight scene between Blackout, Megatron, Starscream and Optimus was impressive, and for that, i grant a star.<br/><br/>The script was about as clichéd as they come, and most of the characters just really got on my nerves my the end of the movie: the twins, the roommate, Mikaela, Sam, Agent Simmons...The list goes on really.<br/><br/>It is not right that an audience member ends up rooting for the bad guys, but by the end i had to question whether any of the miserable parasites aka humans portrayed in the movie were even worth saving.<br/><br/>The effects, as can only be expected are breathtaking. The intricate formation of each transformer shows skill and immense talent. For that it gets a star.<br/><br/>You don't have to take my word on the movie, and you may say i'm only echoing what many reviewers have said before me. Yes, i was very hungover when i saw it, but surely a no-brainer robot awesome fighting action movie is the perfect hangover cure? No, i would rather have gone to see 'The Hangover'."

A lot of it seems to take a large leap of faith just to accept or is given absolutely no explanation of who or what it is. As well intentioned as the humor was for the movie, I think they tried to make it to funny and some of the characters both human and transformer just seem to be there for gags and serve no REAL purpose which drag the film down a bit. There were several really cool ideas in this movie and used to just a mere fraction of what they could have been. Overall, its a fun time at the movies and its pretty good in spots, but it just seems like a rushed together sequel with huge missed opportunities in the end.."

But when you have hack producers who just don't care, a director with ADHD doing his own thing, and writers raised by J.J. Abrams who religiously following the Screenplay Guru roadmap.

It is actually offensive to rational thought and all together non 8 year old minds. So if you are a frat jock or an 8 year old boy and enjoy fart jokes and thing that go BOOM, then this movie is for you, if not then just wait for the DVD so you can say you saw both parts.

I am a huge transformers fan, but this was just simply put not cool.

I felt sorry for Shia LaBeouf having to act out that script. I don't recommend this flick to anyone.. Another thing - Action is fun.. but I think even the action is messed up..

"DonFishies","4","5","13","1 July 2009"," A lackluster sequel that disappoints on almost everything
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is this year's version of The Dark Knight: the big summer sequel that everyone knows and feels the need to see. Undoubtedly, with the possible exception of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince and the enigmatic and potential game-changer Avatar, Transformers will be this year's highest grossing film. But looking past these two similarities (and a handful of scenes filmed to take advantage IMAX screens), Transformers and Dark Knight have absolutely nothing else in common. While Dark Knight was a masterpiece and is one of the greatest sequels ever made, Transformers just may be one of the worst.<br/><br/>Taking the old adage of bigger is better; Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen revolves around the continuing battle between the good Autobots and the evil Decepticons. Once again, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is thrust into the middle of the war after he accidentally finds a shard from the AllSpark that was destroyed in the first film. The resulting pulse the shard gives off gets the attention of the surviving Decepticons, as does Sam's weird habit of writing ancient messages that is read mainly by Transformers. And that is where the titular character of The Fallen, the leader of the Decepticons, comes in as he wants to kidnap Sam to use as bait against Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a busy film that is filled to the brim with ideas and subplots. Virtually everyone in the film has their own storyline and it makes for a movie that has just too much going on. For one thing, it introduces plenty of new Autobots and Decepticons, but the majority is either killed, or does one thing in the film and then is never seen again. They barely even get the time to say one line. New additions to the human cast like Ramon Rodriguez as the conspiracy theorist Leo Spitz, Isabel Lucas' alluring college bombshell Alice and John Benjamin Hickey's punching bag of a government agent Galloway, get very little backstory and are taken out of the film almost as fast as the robots are getting killed. But even the returning cast members (read: practically the entirety of the cast from the original film) get so very little to do that one wonders why they even bothered coming back in the first place.<br/><br/>Because the film is so busy, and Michael Bay seems so intent on filling his explosion and action scene quota to quadruple the size of scenes of exposition and explanation, the film virtually moves from point to point on a whim. A character is introduced late in the film merely to explain everything that has happened, and everything that will happen. He has no development; he is merely a plot device. So very little is explained that it gets to the point where things just happen for no reason, and then the audience is given all of a minute to digest what just happened. Characters die, yet no one seems to really mourn for them. They just pick up and soldier on to the ending. And then when scenes actually do become emotional, they get so melodramatic that you wish there was no focus on them.<br/><br/>There just seems to be no middle ground in the film. Characters, no matter if they are main or supporting, are saddled with horrible or non-existent lines. I realize the film was cobbled and stitched together during the Writer's Strike, but two of the three credited writers are coming off the excellent redo of Star Trek, which ironically was made by the same company as Transformers. But it was affected by the strike too. How can one film be littered with such a wealth of thought out exposition, while the other is basically hobbled by almost none? <br/><br/>But what mangles this film even further is the insistence on being funny. The first film had a bizarre sense of humour that got in the way more than once, but this film is just so over-the-top ridiculous in some scenes that it almost becomes parody. John Turturro is brought back simply to be zany and off kilter and the Autobot ""twins"" Skids and Mudflap are so overtly annoying in their quest to be comic relief that they make Jar Jar Binks look like Brando in The Godfather. But these two examples are just the tip of how much ""funny"" is added into the film. Sex jokes and innuendos are tossed at random (including a scene where a small Decepticon humps Megan Fox's leg), an entirely needless scene with Sam's mom Judy (Julie White) eating ""green brownies"" becomes the focal point of an entire scene, as does a scene involving LaBeouf's odd screaming like a girl. Some of the laughs are genuinely funny, but the majority either fall flat or are totally out-of-place.<br/><br/>What is done right, again, are the incredible special effects. It is still amazing to watch these Autobots and Decepticons face off against each other, and even more so when the newer, larger Transformers come into the fold. The entire opening chase scene in Shanghai is simply marvelous to watch (and such a downer by the end since nothing matches up to it at all). Some of the scenes looked incredibly fake however, especially scenes involving human and robot interaction. Not all of these scenes look the same, but it still makes for a bit more added disappointment.<br/><br/>If you go into Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen hoping for anything outside of awesome effects, just do not even bother. It may look great, and have amazing effects, but the lack of a cohesive plot, too many characters, and its inane humour is so horribly done that you may insist on getting your money back. So little is done right that I genuinely fear for Transformers III.<br/><br/>4/10.<br/><br/>(This review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"mothwar","3","5","13","1 July 2009"," Such a let down...
","OK here's my tuppence worth...<br/><br/>This is from a fan of the original cartoons so I apologise for those of you who are non-fans reading this and can't grasp my feelings towards this shocking film! <br/><br/>It had potential for being a really good film with a G1-esque (G1 being Generation 1 of the Transformers cartoons) story but there's just something missing? There was something about the first film that made it fun to watch, OK there wasn't enough of the robots in there but still it felt better. I watched this in IMAX London at the back and was not totally impressed. The editing of this film was all over the place. Scenes felt rushed and some just cut to the next abruptly. Things were taking place and stuff going on yet without explanation as to why or how. You just had to accept these thus making the whole experience dreary. <br/><br/>For me the...<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>The banter between Megs and SS was spot on I think (from a G1 aspect).<br/><br/>The mythology of Transformers, wasn't as deep as I would of liked it but it was still there.<br/><br/>Scene on Cybertron.<br/><br/>The forest battle was probably my favourite scene in the whole film...Optimus VS Megatron, Starscream and Blackout/Grindor.<br/><br/>""You'll never stop at one....I'll take you all on!"" Is probably my favourite line in the whole film.<br/><br/>Starscream loosing his arm was cool and then being beaten with it by Megatron was like classic Transformers.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Megatron's and Starscream's voice were both slightly different. Starscreams even more. Megatron didn't have his menacing tone like he did in the first film.<br/><br/>The Fallen was underused, like Venom in Spiderman 3.<br/><br/>The Fallen is so powerful and only a Prime could kill him, they never really showed a great battle or why a Prime had certain abilities to kill the Fallen. The final fight felt like an anti climax, felt rushed..it was over in a matter of seconds.<br/><br/>Bay NEEDS to pull the camera back so we can see the whole action, not a section of it.<br/><br/>No voice synthesiser on Soundwave!!!!<br/><br/>The manner in which Devastator got taken out. Not by a Transformer but by a special canon on a battle ship..if the Autobots can't do it, the army can! erm...<br/><br/>It would of been nice to have seen Prime and the Autobots gang up on Devastator and take him down, like those drawings of Raptors taking down a T-Rex or some other huge dinosaur.<br/><br/>SAM DIES AND GOES TO TRANSFORMERS HEAVEN AND COMES BACK TO LIFE?!?!?!!? Come on! That scene belongs to Optimus Prime.......OPTIMUS PRIME IS THEIR DESCENDANT, not Sam!!! That would of been such a great scene.<br/><br/>It would of been better if Optimus Prime was the one looking for the Matrix with Sam and then he(Prime) dies in the battle field at the end, goes to TF heaven, gets revived and fights Devs and the Fallen....it sounds clichéd BUT IT would have been a hell of a better film...at least we would have seen more of Optimus.<br/><br/>The story dragged on in the middle too much. e.g. That Leo roommate was not needed...AT ALL!! He gave nothing to the film (apart from leading Sam to Simmons but I'm sure Sam could of found a way of finding him).<br/><br/>The Pretender Transformer (Isabel Lucas' character) was not needed. I didn't mind the college scenes too much, was expecting them but I felt there was one too many scenes. Not needed.<br/><br/>But my main gripe with the film is this....<br/><br/>The Autobots were sidelined again!!! OK the army was in control of NEST and knowing Optimus' character he would of allowed the Autobots to take command from humans cause this is their planet and they're the outsiders. BUT the film is called TRANSFORMERS!!! Where were they?!?! Hardly any Ironhide or Ratchet or Sideswipe! And Jolt!! Not one word from him!<br/><br/>When Optimus died in the forest, everyone dispersed and left him there. It's expected of the Decepticons to flee cause they just killed Prime, but why did Ironhide and Ratchet leave him? I was expecting them to go up to him, have an emotional scene like in the animation...I think that's what was lacking..there was no real emotion to Optimus dying, BAY did not show the reaction of the Autobots on Primes death. A wasted moment.<br/><br/>The Twins were OK. Not as annoying as Jar Jar thank God but they were in there for too long. They got annoying after a bit!<br/><br/>The film did have good elements in them, like the robots and the small moments. Bumblebee's animations when reacting to Sam are brilliantly done. Bumblebee's animation and reactions were really nicely done...but..BUT there wasn't enough of Bumblebee in this movie.<br/><br/>That's the main problem with this film.<br/><br/>Bay put more in, more Transformers, more action but left out the one thing that counts...character! OK he heard the fans reactions and pleased us, slightly, with the homages, the banter between Megatron and Starscream, Primes flip, etc...but although he put all this into the film, he pushed them to the back and brought forward annoying characters, unnecessary scenes (college, parents scenes were good but too long).<br/><br/>Overall...<br/><br/>3/10...a star for each of my favourite scenes - <br/><br/>1.The opening chase scenes 2.Cybertron scene 3.Forest fight<br/><br/>Would love to give it more but there is nothing else in there to justify it:(<br/><br/>It was just poorly scripted and poorly directed.<br/><br/>The ideas were there but the execution was weak in my opinion.<br/><br/>Keep the same movie-verse, bring on a new director for 3 and get rid of Bay AND Spielberg...Bay had his chance.<br/><br/>Sorry for the length and thanks for reading...that's if you have;)"

","What the hell happened to Michael Bay? Actually, maybe its the other way around. ""The Rock"" was a fluke and turned out the way it did despite all his attempts to ruin it. Maybe senior actors? Don't know. The only reminder that this was his movie was the signature music that has become an anthem in all his movies. That plus the American military extravaganza/Chest thumping that is embedded in every movie incl The Rock. They should have called this ""Keep transforming"" or something like that.Pathetic! Why there were even humans in this movie is beyond me. Could he have not just got Skynet into the mix and saved us from the parents, dogs and girlfriend of our lost soul? Two and a half hours in the expensive IMAX format and the next one hour trying to forget. Michael this sucked and you just lost a big fan!"
"hconglet","5","5","13","29 June 2009"," If only someone who could write could make these movies...
","To say this movie is good would not only be wrong but also disingenuous. Michael Bay has out done himself again by adding more CGI effects than character development and obtaining more military support than a mission to Iraq. As all these preteens gawk and wet themselves at the thought of Megan Fox's curves, adults do the same, so everyone wins here. But where the movie really plummets is in the acting. Over-the-top, cheesy, and pedantic are words that come to mind.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't matter at all. Why? It doesn't make sense. You could drive a train through some of the plot holes in this movie. So if you go see this movie you'll have to sit through pointless dialog and ridiculous plot resolutions. There was one right at the end of the movie that made me fall out of my seat. No, scratch that. There were two. At that point, I was ready for the movie to end, which it soon did. So thank you, movie. You pulled off the band-aid quickly.<br/><br/>Besides all that, it wasn't too bad. The opening scene is so bad-ass that Samuel Jackson gave it a 12 of the B.A.M.F. scale (and that scale only goes up to 5). The action is intense and slightly nauseating at times. For some reason, Bay felt it necessary to have the camera completely zoomed in on the robots whenever they fought each other. Which is ALL THE TIME! If you have motion sickness, I'd recommend that you sit in the back of the theater.<br/><br/>However, this movie shouldn't be taken seriously. The movie is just a fun summer flick. Just ignore everything besides the action and you'll be okay."
"bobo-54","3","5","13","29 June 2009"," Totally redundant, spend your money elsewhere
","Where do I start? The horrors are so many, it's difficult to choose. The action for instance is either way too close-up, or totally over edited so there's actually no way of telling what is happening. Unfortunately, there is a LOT of action.<br/><br/>The characters and plot are there, but it looks like no one actually thought they were important. Whenever there is something vaguely hinting towards a plot, something blows up, or some idiot on screen recaps in 1 or 2 sentences what you should know. Or some stereotype character says something only people with serious brain traumas would think funny. And what is up with those new Autobots.....<br/><br/>Then there's the length of the movie. Did no one stop Michael Bay and tell him that his entire story would fit in to a 20 minute movie? This is where it all comes together: this is nothing more or less than an original 20 minute Transformers episode (including people just suddenly appearing to enter the Autobots in vehicle mode). But why oh why would you need a multi-multi-million dollar budget and 150 (!!!) minutes to portray that? I think it's more than reasonable to expect a LOT LOT more than was delivered in this movie. It's boring, it's incomprehensible, and it just does not deliver. I wish I picked another movie."
"mustluvtacos","2","5","13","29 June 2009"," Why do we allow Michael Bay to continue making movies?
","Awful. Just awful. It's almost as if Bay started making this movie with one idea in his head, ""More Transformers."" That is all. Then as he began shooting, he realized he needed something the resembled a story. While building his story he created many discrepancies from what had already been said in the film. Upon seeing these mistakes, Bay reportedly said, ""People are stupid. They won't notice."" Inconsistencies, pointless running, bad math, annoying comedic relief that isn't funny, and a complete lack of plot all add up to a huge, expensive, explode-y, slap in the face to movie fans everywhere.<br/><br/>Way to go Michael Bay. You destroyed something I love."

","This review was written from the heart.<br/><br/>Hi all...Transformers....saw it 2wice! First of the regular silver screen...and the second was in 2D IMAX (as in normal movie but with IMAX Screen!).<br/><br/>Anyways...here's my take on the movie:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>> Fight scenes were very very well done > Car chases were very very well done > More robots than the first movie > More dialogue in this movie > I think that the intro in the city was probably the best scene in the movie along with the Forest fight....the intro in Shanghai was just amazing, and the whole ""NEST"" concept was really a great way to start. Loved the whole Sideswipe fight scene...amazing stuff...and then the amazing Optimus Prime coming down from a B-52 (could be wrong on that one)...and that was the mother of all intros right there! Very well planned. Grin<br/><br/>and now....the bad...and yes...I'm going to go nasty.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>> Lame human story (expected to be honest)<br/><br/>> Lots of robots yes (but not enough dialogue for them, so we didn't really see any kind of character development in any robot, but the same lacks for humans too)<br/><br/>> Inconsistency / in story....where are they in Egypt...or Jordan??! I kept thinking...OK, the site of the Petra...and the Pyramids...and then they all seem to be near one another!??!<br/><br/>> Humor in the first film was much better. I did like some of the more comedic scenes with Shia Lebouf ... but the Twins have got to go (they didn't add much to the movie except an excuse for GM to show an add for their new ""Beat"" concept and Trax vehicles. But the humour was dull, tasteless, and to be quite honest predicable from Michael Bay movies.<br/><br/>> Story writers didn't bring much character building, even Optimus ""The wisest of them all"" is not given a fair share development, Bumblebee is more a pet than an Autobot.<br/><br/>The one thing I do give them credit for is reviving Megatron, since quite frankly had it not been for the interactions between Megatron and Starscream, this movie wouldn't have had anything resembling the Transformers that I loved growing up to. Yes, it's a ""Hollywood"" version, but come on man...they can't sell out that bad, this is a brand that is here to stay!<br/><br/>> The last 30 minutes of the movie was more or less a ""Copy and Paste"" of the previous movie, with some very very minor changes.<br/><br/>> WTF?!?!?!?!? Soundwave limited to 6 words in the movie (if not less?!). Ultimate disappointment..and what a waste of character....is somebody trying to give Frank Welker the cold shoulder?!? Disappointing...very disappointing. Cry<br/><br/>> The cut scenes, and ""Armageddon"" money shots are great and signature to Michael Bay...but if the movie was shallow like this one...there's really no point in putting everything in slow motion Mike! I felt like I was waking up to a nightmare, and for once I wanted to close my eyes and get back to the damn action sequence!!!<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>All in all, it was a disappointment. It didn't live to the hype if you were a Transformers fan. In the words of Roger Ebert: ""...a horrible experience of unbearable length.""<br/><br/>The movie still took in some money, but it is not going to be sustainable as I'm quite sure that unless they do some major changes in the way the movie is scripted. The 3rd movie is going to flop even with normal fans who only want to see explosions and car chases.<br/><br/>My advice to Paramount (Dreamworks) and Hasbro.<br/><br/>If you're going to make a 3rd movie...than you'll need to do the following:<br/><br/>1) Get new writers! (The story is now totally messed up...Cybertron looks more like a scene from Alien versus Predator!....Why go that route?!?! Take drawings and art from the cartoon / comic books and you'll find Cybertron more of a robotic metropolis. Inspired by Coruscant. Look at the skyline in Coruscant ... place a post apocalyptic setting, and you've got the real Cybertron!<br/><br/>2) Possibly get a new Director (not to say that Bay was bad...it's just that he's become predicable with the Transformers franchise now)...JJ Abrams...anybody who will take it to a new direction.<br/><br/>3) Focus...focus....focus...on character development...AND NO...SAM GRADUATING FROM COLLEGE DOES NOT COUNT! They need to get deeper<br/><br/>Anyways...that's all I can take out of my chest for now...and I'm interested in hearing what you have to say."
"RNMorton","5","5","13","28 June 2009"," Glitzy junk - and not for little kids
","...and if we had stayed for the whole movie, I'd probably be saying too damn long. Took my four year old to this because he loves transformers. He could take a little over an hour and a half and that was about my limit also. Some of the computer generation is well done, BUT 1) you also need interesting plot and characters (the autobots outshine any person here), and 2) this quick-cut music-video directing style during the battle sequences makes it impossible for me to figure out in the least what is happening. I can't imagine my four year old getting it either. Maybe the quick and constant cutting is done to mask some other problem with computer-generated graphics, I don't know, but whatever its reason it really does not work. And besides which, wasn't Michael Bay the guy asking if they could take their ""brewskis"" to the basement in Mystery Men?<br/><br/>Hard to figure the target audience for this - the language is above smaller kids, but there ain't much for adults either so I guess it's whatever's in between. This movie reminds me of the decline of computer gaming in the 90s -- when better graphics became available the actual games themselves became much less compelling. This seems like a waste of a lot of people's efforts."

","Do you know what I saw? A movie that was trying to be adult (hence the swearing as well as the drug related and sexual scenes) but ended up being even more childish then the cartoon series.<br/><br/>Obviously, it was a teenage boy's movie. Action, explosions, ball jokes and Megan Fox were all delivered along side a paper thin plot which moaned with an awful number of references to ""destiny"" and ""fate"" to try keep the whole thing noble and 'King Arthur'-like. It failed no doubt. The villain was a disgustingly overseen stereotype (which character wasn't?); he was evil for the sake of being evil, and able to be destroyed with a slight push. Everyone saw the ending coming, which to be fair, was expected even before entering the cinema. Huge holes became apparent in the plot 'How the hell did the parents get to Egypt?'. I don't care if there is some long-winded, off-screen explanation, it didn't fit at all.<br/><br/>All the comic-relief robots (including the small robot with the New Jersey accent and the two wannabe-ghetto twin robots) were highly irritating and only added more to the juvenile delivery of the movie. 'Oh, how hilarious! A fire-farting robot is humping Megan Fox's leg!! And Megan Fox doesn't even look surprised at all by it..' Even the parents reached a new level of trying to be outrageous in order to be even more hilarious then they were in the first movie. Mother on drugs did you say? How awfully outrageous! Apart from: no plot, the rapid overuse of boring stereotypes, pointless and repetitive action scenes, the over-selling of sex via Fox and the robot-lady. It was okay. It did keep my attention through the duration of the movie (even if it was the gawk in astonishment at the resistance of Megan Fox's indestructible make up which did not smudge or wear off at all during the entire course of the film) which is the primary goal of a movie.

"greeneye59","4","5","13","27 June 2009"," I like the first film, but this one wasn't that great
","Two main problems with this movie were it was too long and there were too many annoying characters. The film felt like Michael Bay was high on cocaine because of the hyperactive pace, the obvious continuity errors, and the overuse of crude comedy. Either that or he's intentionally trying to sink this franchise now.<br/><br/>First let's start with the characters. Jetfire, the stupid Twins, Sam's mom, Wheelie, Simmons, and Leo all had most of the screen time and were EXTREMELY annoying. None of them would shut up. They all would ramble on and on whenever they spoke like they drank a pack of Redbull. Ironhide and Ratchet are basically no shows. Optimus is out for half the movie. And Bumblebee doesn't speak anyway. So we're left with some of the most cringe-worthy characters in film history. Megatron and Starscream are turned into wimps groveling at The Fallen's feet. Megatron grovel? He does. He lost his cool factor. The Fallen just appears out of nowhere and for someone unknown reason only a Prime can defeat him. The never say why.<br/><br/>Second were the continuity errors. If the Constructicons form Devastator, then why were they fighting on the other side of the battlefield while D was climbing the pyramid? Two sets of the exact same Constructicons. That makes perfect sense. And they kept saying Arcee, but where was she? I saw 2 or 3 motorcycles and they referred to all of them as Arcee. What? Was there anybody paying attention when error checking? Third was the overuse of crude, dumb comedy. Devastator would have been awesome if they didn't give him balls (2 swinging wrecker balls dangling between his legs). It wasn't funny and basically turned him into a giant joke. That and the fact he got his ass kicked by the super-annoying twins and Simmons. We're all hoping for a kick ass battle with the Autobots versus Devastator, but all we get is Dumb and Dumber and Simmons beating him. Huge letdown. Jetfire farting, Wheelie leg humping, Sam's mom was stoned and acted like an idiot. I had a headache halfway through the movie.<br/><br/>There were some good scenes. The forest fight. Sam's torture scene. Ravage. But the movie was too long with too many stupid characters. Bay just did too much I think."

","Two things about this film, now this is coming from a guy who loves even the corniest of sci-fi's.<br/><br/>Pro's Sam and his family are always the heart beat of the show. Its the only reason I actually went to see the second one. Cause I knew they would be hilarious and the dynamic that they had between them was perfect.<br/><br/>CON's - The robots. I mean they took all the fast moving unsteady shot ideas from the first movie and then over did it again. I mean really bad, then they tried to create gangster robots. (wont tell you more) but really they took professionalism and through it out the window to try to appeal a wider audience. And they also through in some rather crude humor which at first was funny but then kept re-using it and just came off desperate! As far as the plot, well its kind of the same ol same ol, and as for the beginning of the film you get 10 minutes into it and it was still like ""what exactly is going on?"" the film is 20% acting and 80% something whether it be metal, stone, or rocks exploding in fast or slow motion and of course the camera spinning around.<br/><br/>I saw this film at an IMAX and I gave it 4 stars cause I haven't had a movie made me that motion sick ever, not even the blurry witch project did it. I know Michael could have done better, they just needed to focus on the plot and story, and not show off the Robots.<br/><br/>Kind of like what Spielberg did for Jurrassic park, tone it down and keep it cool! So Id say the first one was better cause it focused on the story and the family was just hilarious, and of course the ""O can do anything I want badge"" fellow!"

It's like toilet humor made by drunk people who fancy cheap jokes. Seriously?! Isn't this movie made by some of the top in Hollywood? Steven Spielberg, where are you!? I am a huge fan of Transformers. Ever since I was a little boy in the 80's I've long for the day I would see Transformers in a real movie, on the big screen. So in 2007 my dream became true. The Transformers-movie was good but I missed several elements... So I really hoped for this sequel. But it totally turned me down.<br/><br/>How is it possible to make such a big movie and don't bother about the storytelling? It's just action action action, more action, some stupid jokes and some hot chicks. Yeah! Wow! Nice! Cool! *goofy* Not really Oscar-material... or is it? Sadly I'm loosing my trust to the film makers... They seem desperate to make money and don't throwing every ingredients to make more and more juicy films... Obviously at the cost of quality."

","Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen Movie Review By, Rajiim Gross of The RAG Review!! 6/22/09<br/><br/>OMG This Film Was Off The Hook!!! It's not often that a Sequel out does it's predecessor, This film does just that!! This film was about 2 1/2 hours long but well worth it!! A few years have past since the first film. there are new Autobots: Sideswipe (who is now a Corvette Stingray. Wish they would have left him the Lamborgini he was back in the day), Twin Arcee's (Pink & Blue), Twins Mudflap & Skids (These Two Hip Hop Talking Autobots were a Riot!), Wheelie (Uncredited on IMDb but sounds like Steve Buscemi, Anthony Anderson or possibly the original Frank Welker) , and Jetfire (Voiced by John Turturro). There are also new Decepticons: The Fallen (Voiced by Tony Todd), The Constructicons with Devestator, Sideways, Soundwave, Ravage & Jolt are all in this film. There is also a NEW Decepticon who I can't reveal to you yet! You need to go see the film! So The Scene is set where Sam (Shia LeBeouf ) is off to College. Mikaela (Megan Fox) doesn't want him to leave nor do his parents, But it's time to grow up and leave home. This is suppose to be a fresh start, free from destruction and robot wars, and even from his trusty friends the Autobots. That last's about a half a day. Sam winds up being hunted again by the Decepticons and the entire World police force as the Decepticons wage war on the Earth until Earth turns over Sam. Lots of Action in this one, LOTS of Sexual innuendos during the first few minutes of the film and a bit more cursing that the last one. Don't Take kids under 13 to this. It seems like Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg are leaning towards making these films more towards the adult crowd who grew up watching The Transformers than the younger crowd the toys are marketed for. (Ok Yes I Still Buy The Toys!) Lots of Familiar faces in this one! Many returning cast members both Human and Robots alike. They even brought back Glenn Morshower (Agent Aaron Pierce from 24) who was killed off (Col. Sharp) in the first Transformers film as General Morshower in R.O.T.F.! ! Also according to IMDb.com, Jazz (Darius McCrary) who was killed by Megatron in Transformers. He is credited on IMDb but I didn't see him in the film. There was a lot of fast paced action taking place on screen as well as plenty of comedic moments! My favorite was when Sam's mom (played by Julie White) was dropping him off at college and eats a Brownie baked with Marijuana that she bought at a campus bake sale. The whole theater was laughing! Everyone enjoyed this film. Everyone Clapped and cheered as it ended. It left an opening as did the first one for a sequel (which is rumored to be coming making this a trilogy). I Give This an A+!"

","Expectations were high, following the brilliant 2007 movie - and we all know how this can lead to disappointment. I needn't have worried. Michael Bay has proved himself to be a true disciple of the TF world. Storywise, it's a bit light, but TF:RotF more than makes up for this in out-and-out mind-blowing action and having the 'cool' factor in spades. Criticisms? Well, I personally thought more could've been made of the Jetire character, but I'm probably biased on account of his toy being my favourite when I was a boy! Some slightly clunky CGI during the final face-off between Prime and The Fallen is the only other thing to draw a negative, but these minor criticisms aside, TF:RotF does what it sets out to do: it takes you on a roller-coaster ride of action and fantasy, and remains true to the TF heritage. Well Done."

","Let me start by saying I loved the first Transformers movie, and thought it was one of best action films I've seen since the original Die Hard. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, however, was absolutely terrible. This is not to say that the action scenes are not spectacular, because they are. The special effects and CGI were incredible, as expected. Unfortunately, special effects alone do not make a good movie. You need a good plot, good writing, and believable acting. This movie provides none of these. The writing was absolutely terrible. It was cheesy and juvenile. The plot was very weak, and the acting, probably mostly because of the writing, was not very good either. I normally like Shia Labeouf, but in this movie, I found him hard to watch, despite the fact that his performance was probably the best in the movie. I felt that this movie had potential, but because of bad writing, and a director who cared more about big booms and pretty robots, it ultimately failed...After two and a half hours, I left the theater saying, what did I just spend my money on..."

People will think that at 147 minutes long that it is a tad bit on the long side but you'll leave the cinema unbelievably as the 147 minutes have gone by in a flash. I think that this film is the best I have seen in a very very long time, the only problem I have with the film is that it doesn't really explain that much about the history of the transformers enough."

","Everybody already must have attended a film of Michael Bay, after all is all equal ones: lack of script or argument, explosions and total destruction capable to make any spectator to leave deaf person the session. But the films of Michael Bay go beyond: a vast amount of stereotypes, characters who say to prejudiced messages during all the exhibition, being clearly the male chauvinism of director in question.<br/><br/>This sequel of "" Transformes"" it is accurately this: one has filmed made donkey to take teenagers in the puberty to the theaters, with intention to only gain money. That's OK, entertainment is not a sin, but the entertainment of the films of Michael Bay is offensive to any person who has brain. It remains to know the reason for which the director Steven Spielberg accepted to enter in the project, since it makes films of much more deep entertainments of what Michael Bay.<br/><br/>At last, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" it can until I came if to become the biggest box office of the year, but sincerely, i think the public wait more than a film that only has cars explosions, almost naked women and extra prejudiced jokes."

","Yikes what happened to Michael Bay after he made the first enjoyable flick. I was forward to this one so I seen it on the IMAX and I hated it right from start to end. There was absolutely no story and so painfully boring throughout. The movie had so many ridiculous jokes (mostly sexual) that were not even a jot funny and they actually embarrass you.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen tried its level best to be as entertaining as possible but it actually had the opposite effect. Anyone who has liked this torture device should go see a doctor.<br/><br/>This is probably the second movie after The Dark Knight with IMAX scenes and even those scenes were awful, they were not well made and were merged to normal scenes. So there was an IMAX scene for a few seconds then a normal scene then IMAX until it drives you mad. The Dark Knight had amazing IMAX scenes. Anyway after I seen this stupid movie I had a headache for about a few hours. Overall it is the biggest let-down of the year after Spider Man 3."
"steve2901","1","6","17","3 August 2009"," Way too long and very tedious.
","By the time the Egypt sequence began I really did not care anymore and just wanted the film to be over. It was just far far too long, in my opinion. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay, and the first Transformers film wasn't exactly the best but I voted it a 6/10. But the action sequences were so, so repetitive. I was glad that Bay chose not to film them way too close up this time, like he did in the first film, but it just seemed to be the typical Baysplosion sequence over and over again. Not to mention the now-overused Bullet Time sequence that seems to be in every summer action movie nowadays. It's so overused even The Simpsons Movie did it. If there were no slow-motion sequences in Revenge of the Fallen the runtime would be at least half an hour shorter. Another complaint I have is the same as one I had with the first film - too much humans, not enough Transformers. Shia's whole mental breakdown thing made me cringe, and all those pointless scenes with his mom at the start - if I wanted to see a stoner movie, I would have gone to see one."

","With Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, director (and I use that term in the loosest possible sense) Michael Bay hasn't just achieved a new low in his god-awful career but has quite possibly reached the absolute nadir of the cinematic art-form. An incomprehensible two and a half hour orgy of stupefyingly crass nonsense, this garbage substitutes loud smashes, rapid dialogue, insanely fast editing and a tidal wave of CGI for actual talent, the result being one of the least pleasurable film experiences of my life.<br/><br/>In addition to the digitally-enhanced audio-visual maelstrom that constitutes the bulk of this mess, the film also boasts a lousy script (featuring ridiculous comedy relief robots and a randy chihuahua) and some really wooden performances, with poster-boy-for-Dreamworks-SKG Shia La Beouf being the worst offender (let's hope that appearing in Lars Von trier's Nymphomaniac kills his career), and gratuitous eye-candy Megan Fox coming a close second.<br/><br/>My ten year old son, who presumably falls slap bang in the centre of the film's demographic, bailed about halfway though, bored to tears by the endless drivel being served up to him; unfortunately for me, I always insist on watching a movie in its entirety before slagging it off, and stayed to the bitter end.

The plot is conventionnal, it's the bad guys against the good guys and the US army is on the goods' side. The evil ones want to destroy the sun and the good ones need to stop them. How typical.<br/><br/>The acting is not at his best. Shia did a great job but the love story between him and Megan Fox is just lame. All the other actors are useless. Best performance though : Hugo Weaving. man he rocks the Megatron guy!! Why did a put a 10? Well, if you own a home theater system : YOU GOTTA HAVE THIS ON BLURAY! The sound is just awesome.

Well, it's an orgy for the eyes and the ears.<br/><br/>I recommend this title if you like explosions, killer robot fight scenes and things like that. The US Army did a great job to help Bay.

"darrenmullins","8","4","10","4 July 2009"," Better than the 2007 film
","I just came from the cinema where I just watched Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. Although the movie had some faults, I did enjoy it. I think the movie could have been about 20-30 minutes shorter. The last scene was far too long. The dialogue of the Skids and Mudflap could have been more enjoyable without the potty talk. I do not mind them (Skids and Mudflap) acting smarter than they actually are, but the potty talk was annoying. The biggest flaw of this movie is that Michael Bay has tried to introduce too much over a short period of time. Anyone who is familiar with Transformers knows that there are over 300 different robots. I think Michael Bay probably feels pressure to introduce as many favorites as he can, but this leaves us with characters who appear for one or two scenes and never develop. The good things about the movie include the fact that Megatron is back (only giving him 20 minutes in the first film was not enough), getting to see more of the robots (a big improvement over the 2007 film), less product placement (it is there, it just doesn't seem as common) and despite what people say about no plot, there is a plot and story. Sure there are mistakes, but the film should entertain long-time fans."

","After I watched the first movie, being a huge fan of the Tranformers cartoons when I was young, it turned out that the movie was good, but just not quite perfect. Having a couple of flaws in the script, having 99% action and 1% storyline, I felt the movie could have used a couple of extra minutes, dedicated to maybe creating an enjoyable atmosphere, like some more high-school life, some friends, you know...<br/><br/>The second movie, unlike what some of my friends said, had the perfect length (personally, I hate movies that last 90 minutes or less) great action and a decent storyline (again, it was acceptable, but I didn't go watch the movie for the storyline... if I wanted that I'd have gone to see a psychological movie or something) and I really had a great time watching the 5-10% storyline and 90% action in this 2.5hr movie.<br/><br/>If you haven't watched it, when you do, make sure you're ready for science fiction and a lot of robot related action. It's what the movie is about! If you're not ready for that, don't watch it (a lot of people are actually putting up bad comments, because they were expecting realistic stuff. It's not realistic, but sci-fi, nor is it a detective movie where you have to pay attention to the storyline, but it was never meant to be that and it's absolutely awesome as it is). The movie will take you on an awesome 2.5hr ride and if you don't get distracted by your girlfriend/boyfriend or any of your friends, you will enjoy it for sure!"
"lagergren168","10","4","10","2 July 2009"," It is a shame this film hasn't received better critical reception since its release.
","Michael Bay has revived TRANSFORMERS, given it new life, and breathed creativity into a ""campy"" 80's cartoon that was silly to begin with! It was innovative when it first appeared on Saturday mornings in 1984, but that was then and this is now! <br/><br/>The effort that went into the visual mechanics is incomprehensible. It is non-stop eye candy from beginning to end, and every CGI sequence is gorgeous! ILM has truthfully outdone themselves this time.<br/><br/>Another point I would like to make is the public's outlook on the story. Hopefully, everyone was watching the same film as I was because this movie has a step-by-step plot. It's not Oscar material, but what summer blockbuster is? Not even the well-reviewed and fan-adored ""Dark Knight"" received a nomination for best picture, and this is no exception! It is pure summer entertainment<br/><br/>I'd like every fan of the original 80's cartoon to watch episodes of that show, then compare it to this movie.<br/><br/>There is no comparison... Michael Bay and his team have turned a seemingly ""stupid"" TV series into a full-fledged, action-packed, head-throbbing experience that keeps you wanting more action after every robotic punch thrown!"

","Again I find myself scratching my head as I reflect on this movie having watched it with my 3 kids (14, 14, 12). I wonder if the critics who have appointed themselves the geru's of the movie industry, if they have truly forgotten what they review movies for. Movies are about entertainment, if that has changed then I need to give up my DVD collection. We have Drama's, Suspense, Comedies and then we have Action to name a few. Maybe I am just a low maintenance guy who has the sense God gave a coaster, or maybe I am just a person who wants to go to a movie that entertains me on a very simple level, be it I laugh, or cry or there are plenty of explosions I want to be entertained. Transformers entertains and then some, I am a childhood fan of the cartoon series and I applaud the writers and director for adding some references from the cartoon series. The critics said it was loud, have you ever heard of a soft bomb, or soft mechanical robots fighting? The critics said there was no human element, I think the critics need to check their pulse. Movies are about entertainment on a simply level, you want action Transformers has it. Is it loud, do they fight in a big way, are there loads of things going on? Yes, yes, and yes and guess what... It's Entertaining."
"morgan8807","8","4","10","26 June 2009"," I just saw the movie, and here are my thoughts
","So, a friend of mine once told me that whenever you expect something, everything else you think will be based specifically on whether or not you got what you expected. I've found that to be strikingly true specifically about the movies I go to see, and Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen (Let's call it TRF for the time being) is one of those.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is once again at his earth shattering, apocalypse now-ish best. Known specifically for his ability to blow stuff up in new and exciting ways, he once again delivers. <br/><br/>It's been two years since the first movie, and Sam is getting ready or college and a whole new world for him. His girlfriend, Mikaela, now officially loves him. But that's not all. The Autobots are working with the government to track down the rest of the Decepticons. Turns out, the Decepticons manage to steal the last ""big"" piece of the Allspark and revive Megatron, and his master, known as 'The Fallen' sends him to get Sam, who has accidentally been given all the knowledge of the Allspark thanks to the last ""small"" fragment of the Allspark. From there on, everything is all about the fighting. And boy is there a lot of it. <br/><br/>So, the first thing I want to comment on is the acting, both voice and non-voice. All of the Transformers' voices were perfect, displaying personalities far beyond what we had previously seen. On key, however, is the issue with the twin autobots, and their alleged racist characters. While I could potentially see this as true, it's not and for good reason. Simply put, they are robots that have personalities. Other then that minor issue, everything was perfectly done. <br/><br/>Acting-wise, I would tend to disagree with some of the reviewers on this board. Most of the scenes in this movie are legitimetally acted, sometimes pushing me to the edge of awe. Specifically, the scene near the end with Sam and his dad bring me to near tears to see how deeply they care for each other. Also, the military roles are played believably, and Megan Fox is shown to clearly have become a better actress, adding raw emotion and frailty to a character who many considered a 'sexual addition' to the first movie.<br/><br/>Graphics, wise...I'm just going to compare this movie to the first Jurassic Park. Bay has very clearly stepped up from the previous film, where things were 'real' and 'practical', and embraced the possible. That being said, Bay certainly took some leaps of faith. Devastator, in specific, is incredible. The sheer scale of that Decepticon is just astounding. The fight scenes were bigger, the explosions were more impressive, and the fight scenes (for both the humans and the Transformers) was incredibly well done. Specifically, a woodland scene where Optimus takes on 3 other Decepticons left me with a feeling of awe at the sheer power and skill of Optimus. <br/><br/>The only other addition I can make to this review is that some of the scenes in this movie were truly powerful, and thought provoking. Not the thoughts of 'wow..I wonder if I agree with that or not' but 'wow...can people really care so much for each other that they'd be willing to give it all for someone?' <br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie to see. While certainly not the movie of the century, certainly a movie that will draw you in, make you laugh and make your jaw drop in awe, and totally blow you away!"
"MistaSquiggley","Null","4","10","26 June 2009"," Painful and Insulting
","The usual defense in this situation is, ""if you were looking for deep plot and Oscar-worthy acting, then of course you were going to be disappointed."" But this is not a valid excuse for the travesty that was Transformers 2. Just because a movie is based off of a cartoon which is based off of a toy, this doesn't mean that the director doesn't have to construct a good plot. Is it terrible to ask that a movie with a $150 million budget have a decent plot line? But a decent plot line there was not. There was something about a key, and a machine to blow up the sun, but the rest of the plot was so haphazardly thrown together that it seemed to have fallen last on the list of Michael Bay's priorities in this film. Priority one was, it seemed, to blow up as much as humanly possible. Some people can endure 2 1/2 hours of explosions, others cannot.<br/><br/>The acting is not only sub-par, it's lazy. It's as if all the actors in the film knew they were only second to the super-cool robots, and so they PLAYED second to the super-cool robots. Shia and Megan's romance was hard to care about, because there was no chemistry, and it was very annoying to see Megan Fox's character embody the ""love-obsessed-girlfriend"" stereotype. The world is about to blown up and all she can care about is the fact that her boyfriend hasn't said the ""l"" word yet? Please. At that point, no one cared. In fact, no one really cared about much in this movie except the fights, and it doesn't matter that it's an action movie or not. People still need to care about what they're seeing, it doesn't matter whether it's a movie about the Holocaust, or a movie about a toy. People need to care, or else what's the point of going?"

"marine_invader","7","4","10","24 June 2009"," Lacking Substance, but style outshines
","This movie is way bigger and better than the first. Let's just get that out of the way. If you're wanting more of what the first one lacked, i.e., the transformers (whichever ones that may be) being in the movie more and fighting more, YOU WILL GET THAT IN SPADES IN THIS MOVIE. Steven Spielberg coming on knew what to add and Michael Bay outdoes himself with action, and ILM once again raises the bar for CGI. This is, however, all surface.<br/><br/>Once you get beneath the surface, ROTF starts to have problems. The first hour of the movie is unfortunately focused on Sam's parents, who, though their stupidity had a place in the first movie, as it was worked in mostly around the transformers being in and around their house, this time is for some inexplicable reason given its own spotlight. It's somewhat funny, but almost seems unnecessary especially given that the second half of the movie turns polarizingly grim, touching on topics such as the end of the world, Sam's potential death, and even featuring stronger robot violence that culminates with Prime ripping The Fallen's face off. No lie. Therefore, this kind of stupid humor, which infects several other characters, both robot and human, seems like a waste of screen time. It should have been refined or even curtailed to allow for as few groans as possible. However, there is one point in which I'm willing to forgive the stupid humor: Jon Turturro's Agent Simmons. His character actually works. Changing NOTHING of the wacky, over-the-top nature of his character keeps him consistent with who he was in the first movie and actually puts the other stupidity around him in check as if to say, ""this is how it's done"". It's also a breath of fresh air when Sam's parents are captured in France by a Decepticon, something that shouldn't necessarily be true.<br/><br/>However, being that there isn't a TON of excess story, four groups of people running around like in the first, allows for the transformers to shine. And, GOD, do they shine. From a sequence where a human-transformer tries to kill Sam to Optimus Prime fighting Blackout, Starscream, and Megatron all at once and almost winning. However, once Prime leaves the movie, a lot is lost until the final act. With him goes his gravitas, and it's replaced with the silly antics of Mudflap and Skids along with excessive and almost pointless ramblings by the Fallen, who does nothing until the last 15 minutes of the movie. This is a major weakness of the movie, but due to awesome shot after awesome shot, is glossed over. There is one scene in particular towards the end that really annoyed me. As Sam arrives where Prime's body is with what he believes to be the Matrix of Leadership, there is still 45 minutes left in the movie...yep, you probably guessed it. It takes him almost a half an hour of screen time to reach Optimus' body while a haphazard battle (though awesome) takes place to protect the same body between the same Autobots who have been on screen since the beginning and eight new Decepticons who aren't even named.<br/><br/>This is also something that weakens the movie. Unlike in the first movie, where the viewer could connect in one way or another to each recognizable transformer (Decepticon or Autobot), there are so many in this movie that a lot of the important ones from the first movie, like Ironhide and Ratchet, are practically sidelined in terms of screen time and others are poorly introduced if at all. If you're willing to forgive this because the battles are awesome, then that's fine, but you are rewarded when a nonpresent Scorponok re-emerges to attack Jetfire as he's wiping out various Decepticons. Further rewards come when a revived but almost lethally weakened Optimus fuses with a dead Jetfire to battle The Fallen, who is trying to use his newly activated device to kill all humanity and harvest the sun for Energon. This sequence is spectacularly satisfying, as this new Optimus battles Megatron, Starscream, and The Fallen, a reference to the scene earlier, all by himself, but this time comes out on top, and Megatron and Starscream flee as they are half destroyed and The Fallen is dead.<br/><br/>In all, there is just way too much screen time. The movie plays out like this: there are a million small bad things that progressively pile up over the course of the movie like a turning tide, as the lesser number of awesome scenes turn the tide with each one's progressively bigger quality, edging out the bad in the end. In all, it is actually really enjoyable, but it feels like a schizophrenic journey as you enjoy the same movie at different times for completely different and often contradictory reasons. For example, a lot of Skids/Mudflap's lines are really funny so you enjoy them because they're silly, but you enjoy Optimus' moments of seriousness and violence too. In the end, it's a great popcorn flick, perhaps the best of the summer, but it never rises above it. I went in expecting this movie to do to the first movie what TDK did to Batman Begins: Dwarf it in scope, quality, and action. Instead, it delivered a lot of the same things from the first movie, just more of them. However, if you are looking for big robots beating the oil out of each other, you won't find a finer example then ROTF, not for a long time."

","Entering this movie I was expecting a great summer blockbuster with a ton of action, and I was apparently expecting too much. <br/><br/>The movie starts off similar to the first one; we see a glimpse of past events involving the Autobots and Decepticons. We are then sent to modern day and we learn about the new team involving humans from the first film (and new ones obviously) and the Autobots. Here we are introduced to the following, new, Autobots: the twins (I hated the twins for the first part of the movie but they slowly grew on me), an ice cream truck (I think it was Arcee but I'm not sure) and sideswipe. Sideswipe makes a great entrance. After this mini action scene, which was done well, we begin to learn more about the fallen and the Decepticons plan this time. <br/><br/>The next 30-45 minutes about all involves Sam leaving home for college and all that. There is only one or two decent action scenes in this part of the movie and 3 or 4 mini scenes total. Then the fun begins. After this lame 45 minutes or so we are transported to the forest area you may recognize from the trailers for an awesome fight scene. Then after this fight we get a whole lot of Michael Bay trying to expand on this movie's plot. Besides a few moments where we go between Cybertron and Earth not a whole lot goes on. There is no real action for a long chunk of time. <br/><br/>The final 20-30 minutes, about, however were great! You may have seen the Egypt battle in the trailers well this is it! It's finally here and delivers, unfortunately it does not make up for the other flaws. The script writers need to be FIRED before the third movie. The dialogue between the twins at times was beyond awful and at times the twins seemed more interested in fighting each other, than protecting Sam. The soldiers in this movie need to learn exactly how soldiers act especially Lennox. Also Starscream is not a little pussy so don't try to make him one. <br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf's acting was not bad at all and Megan Fox shockingly proved to me that she may actually be developing some talent. Simmons also provided a few good moments and I am happy to see they brought him back. Sam's parents also offered good moments in this film like they did in the last one. Bumblebee was shockingly powerful and a total badass! (For someone who is supposed to be a scout he sure acted like more than that) <br/><br/>Will I see this movie again yes; however I highly doubt I will be going to see it a second time in theaters. I still have yet to decide if this movie was better than the first one and I will need to see it again before I can fully decide. Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is a solid summer film that will be enjoyed by some but it is not the biggest movie of the summer. Star Trek and Terminator Salvation were both better than this movie. While certain action scenes were great they do not make up for all the other flaws listed above and others I did not mention because they involve spoilers. Overall I give Transformers Revenge of the Fallen an 8 out of 10."

","I was very excited about this film. When I first saw the trailer, I was blown away by how good it looked. It is the perfect film if you just want to shut off your brain and just enjoy massive explosions, huge robots fighting and amazing visual effects.<br/><br/>The visual effects were just absolutely stunning! The amount of work that must have gone into creating the fight sequences must have been immense, but they did an excellent job (the transformation of Devastator was a definite highlight!)<br/><br/>For me, the comedy element was a bit too much, however it did provide a few good jokes here and there. It's always good to have humour in films like this, but this was mainly very slapstick and annoying at times (Sam's mother and those ridiculous twin robots for instance!). The plot seemed quite ludicrous, but hey, it is an alien robot film (and a Michael Bay film).<br/><br/>It's a very typical Bay film, with vast amounts of action, cheesy comedy, dramatic camera techniques and intense music, but ticks all the box of what a summer blockbuster should be. Don't go into the film and start to pick holes in the acting or script cos you won't find many positive things to say.<br/><br/>Just sit and marvel at the amazing effects and enjoy the brilliant explosive thrill ride that this movie brings!!"

","I saw Transformers ROTF last night. Although; the story was crazy, the humour was in some parts too stupid, the film became confusing at points and the robot to audience connection was far less than in the first movie I thoroughly enjoyed this. I don't want to spoil anything for our American friends but be prepared for the first scene in Shanghai. In my eyes that part blows you away. What a great way to start the movie. It jumps straight in and hits you in the face with action from the off. The forest fight scene is also a mega deathmatch, although I would like to see it in Imax due to there being a longer cut for fighting in that version. Don't listen to the haters, listen here - Transformers 2 is a whirlpool of plot holes but you know what? Just enjoy it for what it is. Oh and by the way, Jetfire rules."

","I went to see Transformers last night at my local cinema. I went in with an open mind because of the bad reviews that it has received on IMDb and in the local newspapers.<br/><br/>However i have to say i really enjoyed the film. Its much like the first film with it's action and its humor which has been significantly cranked for this film, some times for the better other times its quite pointless. The films SFX are again breathtaking and slightly better than the first film. However, when there is a lot of action happening on screen the robots seem to move very quick so you cannot see anything very clearly, i am not sure if this is because its hard to get it clear whilst moving at fast speeds.<br/><br/>Overall the film is slightly dragged out by about 30 mins but still fun nevertheless.

","From the uninviting opening sequence with a poorly written narrative from the only somewhat redeeming quality of this film (Optimus Prime being that which brings this debacle close to redemption) to the anti-climactic final shots, this film (for lack of a better term) was a wash. Please allow me to site reference, rhyme and reason why (no spoilers).<br/><br/>I just want to get this out in the open, before this tirade of disgust and (less than satisfied) emotion come pissing from my ass, I AM A FAN OF COMIC/TOY/HERO FILMS. Moving on...<br/><br/>MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) apparently had a dynamic impact on the choreography of this flop. Transformers using their knees and elbows, closed and open hand strikes, even a ""ground and pound"" scattered their droppings on the messy and all around confusing battle scenes where (as Peter Travers, Rolling Stone Magazine put it) you don't even know who is fighting who and who is winning.<br/><br/>Wait, are there any winners when it comes to this film? Seems like a solid last place, fat kid on the basketball court, OJ Simpson for ""Husband of the Year"" award snow balls chance in Hell to me.<br/><br/>Megan Fox (may I move on with this rant, please). Megan Fox... well.... I believe the ""Politically Correct"" term for the manner in which she is portrayed in this film would be ""scantily clad"". She was dressed like a 15 year old on their older sisters college campus, man, desperate for attention. The wardrobe department took what is a naturally beautiful woman and made her a skank, no thank you, I'll stick to the Today Show interview version of Fox instead.<br/><br/>Shai (I could check IMDb for proper spelling but he isn't worth a second tab on my screen) Le-BadActor (that's his last name, right, or wait no it was a joke) could not act his way out of a wet paper bag. I'll be honest, I can't act for sh*t dude, but I'll call him out any day but Sunday (gotta keep the Sabbath holy babies). He needs to just stop, right now.<br/><br/>Actually you know what, I'm going to stop right now myself, I can't believe I wasted even more time on this crap shoot than the 2.5 painful hours spent in the confines of the theater. This is just ridiculous man, this movie didn't need elicit a well thought response, what a waste.<br/><br/>Last word then I'm going to drink bleach and Drano and try and purge this toxic waste from my body, this film is a 0 out of 10 to me. Poor editing, poor writing, a poor film maker on a power trip, too much money wasted on what weren't remotely convincing CGI... A total wash.<br/><br/>Epic fail.<br/><br/>F*ck you, Michael Bay."
"bh_tafe3","4","5","14","18 September 2012"," Michael Bay strikes back
","After an original surprisingly lacking Michael Bay's usual crass staples, he produces a sequel brimming with them. This film is the worst excesses of his style, and its biggest strengths rolled into one.<br/><br/>The story in the original film was admittedly slight, but in this sequel it is basically non-existent. Megan Fox has lost any vestiges of character and is here simply playing a brunette barbie doll, but she does look good lying across the frame of a motor bike and we salute Michael Bay for bringing this to our attention, though question whether the 10 year old and youngers who make up the primary audience of this film are as enamoured with a denim clad female buttocks as we are. Shia Lebeouf's character is displaying almost no growth at all from the first film and some of the new support Transformers you will want to see atomised, particularly the ones that accompany Spike in the desert. I do like the idea of the fallen, and the new character Jetfire. Jetfire was in the original TV show, toys and comics, though his back story here, and indeed entire character are so different he might as well be a new creation. Starscream is again wasted, though his attempts to suck up to Megatron are funny.<br/><br/>The nano-bots are well realised and there are a lot of breath taking action sequences, including the desert eating Devastator, but as in the last twenty minutes of the original it is often hard to tell who is who, and some of the characters are such grotesque stereotypes, that there isn't any tension in seeing them in peril anyway.<br/><br/>John Turtorro returns to lend some interest to proceedings. His appearance in the film is like a breath of fresh air. He loses some of his edginess from the original, but is still easily the most interesting human on screen. The ending is a text book anti climax.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is very good with set pieces, special effects and action sequences, but vulgar characterisations and story telling devices also litter his films. When he mixes them all together right, as in the Rock, the results are ridiculously entertaining. When he gets it wrong, as he did here, the results while watchable due to the sheer scale, are disappointing."

Please refrain from eroding Film-goers expectations of a good or great film. You need to ask yourself if it was really worth it. Studio's, pay attention. Let someone who is gifted or super-talented handle a big undertaking such as this. There is a delicate balance between plot/robots/fantasy and the forgotten human element, that should be addressed here.

"rj-1","1","5","14","6 July 2009"," Awful, confusing, and loud
","For anyone wondering about the accusations of racism in this movie, let me sum it up for you. There are two robots obviously meant to be comedic goofs. Their mechanical heads look like monkeys, they speak with a stereotypically black urban vernacular, and they can't read. Though they're clearly played to be funny, they have no jokes. The joke simply seems to be, ""Hahaha! They're black!"" And that's what's offensive.<br/><br/>Lest you think I'm being an over-sensitive liberal, my Republican brother sitting next to me was just as offended.<br/><br/>But why harp on racism when there is so much else wrong with this movie? Actually, let me back up towards racism again by pointing out that Tyrese Gibson was handed all the most abysmal lines, seemingly picked from the poo bucket of action movies past. Every shot of Megan Fox is apparently inspired by the visual lyricism of Lowrider magazine. And she seems too hot to be with Shia LeBeouf, unless she is far too sheltered in far too small of a town, but that's beside the point.<br/><br/>Nothing makes sense. At one point, John Turturro (earning a paycheck) has a mini-rant in the direction of one elderly robot who can't stay focused on his story, exclaiming, ""Give me a story..Beginning, middle, end!"" I thought this clearly could have been Turturro running his own inner dialogue when the camera just happened to be rolling. It is revealed that the Deceptacons want to kidnap the energy of the sun. This isn't explained to us until it nearly happens, and yet everyone seems to know about it. Too loud of a sound effects and music mix makes 80% of the dialogue impossible to understand. When you hear the other 20% you find that you're not missing much the rest of the time. The incredibly intricate CGI work is the most intelligent thing happening. In fact it is so intricate, that you're never certain what you're looking at. Every fight sequence is just a ball of digitized metal clanking around with another one, and by the time it's done, you don't care enough about anyone.<br/><br/>I feel roughly %85 dumber after having seen this. If you haven't noticed, this may be the worst movie I've ever seen."

The entire time I kept thinking ""Well what is the significance of this part? Well who is this robot? WHY are they fighting? HOW does this scene relate to anything? WHAT IS GOING ON HERE!?"" I'm talking about even within the opening scenes. And the swearing? Out of place! The Jar Jar Binks-esquire comedy relief just added another layer of disappointment.<br/><br/>Loved the first one... but my god this movie flat out sucks. I didn't believe the negative reviews on here and went to see this garbage anyway when I could have saved my time and money. Don't bother with this one.

","This film was ridiculously epic. It was filled with massive explosions and ferocious battle scenes which left you on the edge of your seat squealing like a 3 year old.<br/><br/>The humor was not hit in miss in this film, and the robots were genuinely funny (especially the Twins). The points of comic relief were genius and I have to say gave the movie nice vivacity.<br/><br/>The score was the second best part of this movie. In the background of the action scenes I could hear music such as Linkin Park's New Divide and Nickelback's burn it to the ground. It vexed me slightly that some of the songs were greatly edited (for short bursts of music), but all in all the songs they used were wonderful and fit the movie.<br/><br/>The most amazing part of the movie were the special effects. The explosions were on a scale never before seen and made you nearly jump from your seat. The humongous transformations that each robot did was absolute eye candy. The only bad camera use was when the tried to make a shot epic by circling around the actor a few times. That was dumb, but a minor flaw in comparison with the awesomeness of the movie.<br/><br/>Megan Fox was as usual stunningly gorgeous. Her acting doesn't bother me, but a lot of people criticize her. Realistically she is Sam's hot sidekick. So she really doesn't need to act, just be hot. Personally I think her acting is satisfactory to add to the epic aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also did an excellent job acting. They were spectacular. No moments of cheesiness, like in many other movies.<br/><br/>This is without a doubt one of the top ten movies ever made.<br/><br/>You have to see this movie!"

","Having loved Transformers 1 I was almost as excited as my kids were about the sequel. It didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>More robots, more action, humour and tension gave the film emotion and allowed you to almost believe it was real.<br/><br/>Sam and Bumblebee's relationship was developed and the plot line between Sam and Optimus showed a softer side to these huge robots.<br/><br/>The screening I viewed had an audience made up mostly of children (some who were possibly under 5) so some of the language made me a little uncomfortable but the action sequences allowed for the comments to be lost as quickly as they came.<br/><br/>The introduction of the Twins, Skids and Mudflap, were a welcome release from the tension of the overall story and very much appealed to the children in the audience.<br/><br/>The film is rated a 12A in the UK and whilst I agree with this rating I would suggest you think hard about taking an under 5 year old. Whilst they love the toys, and probably have watched the first film on DVD there were some scenes that were very loud, very explosive and could scare a younger viewer.<br/><br/>Having said that I loved the film, the special effects were amazing and I was at a loss to try and remind myself that the robots weren't real. The action was compelling and the story line was easy to follow. Given that children will be watching this film I felt that scenes where people were hurt or killed were superbly handled and therefore you felt genuine empathy for the outcome of the Sam/Optimus plot.<br/><br/>By far for me Revenge of the Fallen is the best family action film of 2009, as long as your family isn't too young!"

","I created my profile on IMDb just so that I can tell people how bad this movie is. I have never left a movie feeling as mad as I did when I left Transformers 2. The movie is too long, well over 2 hours and 20 minutes. And in those 2 hours and 20 min., Michael Bay barely uses the dialog to tell a story. Instead he tries to make the audience laugh. Actually it seems as if the dialog is intended to just make the audience laugh, because almost none of it helps the viewer understand what is going on. I really wanted this movie to be good because there weren't many movies that I wanted to see this summer. I think that the reason this movie is doing so well in the box office is because there is no other action movie that can compete with it this summer. A lot of people like to give summaries for the movies they are reviewing. Here is a summary for this movie...good special effects. That is all the movie has to offer. Please if you are reading this review and have not seen the movie, please do not pay 8 bucks to see it. Wait until it comes out in the dollar theaters or just wait to rent it. If you pay the full 8 bucks then you will just encourage Michael Bay to direct equally horrible films."

","Having just been to the cinema to see Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen, I must express my complete and utter disappointment, anger and contempt towards the director Michael Bay and the writers who came up with this utter trite, hackneyed rubbish to use a mild term they have churned out. I mean don't get me wrong it started well with the story picking up a few years later where after the defeat of the Decepticons and their leader Megatron the main human hero Sam Witwicky having finished high school is now off to college and is trying to maintain a long distance relationship with his girlfriend Michala. The Autobots are now an integral part of human society, and to that end they help the government track down any Decepticons that have gone into hiding since their defeat and help eliminate that threat. But unfortunately after that it soon fell apart and it turned into one big corny joke fest where the one liners were so poor a ten year old could have written better jokes and a better script for that matter. I was so disgusted and angry at how this film was turning out I was very tempted to walk out the theatre in disgust, which for me very rarely happens because I like to stay until the end even after the credits have rolled. My main bugbear about this film was the characters, chiefly the Autobots and the Decepticons and perhaps a few of the human characters as well who were supposed to be military officials but turned out to be jackasses instead. The characters became parodies of what they originally started out as in the first film. For example in the first film even though Starscream was subservient to Megatron he did not turn into a snivelling, cowardly piece of scrap like his cartoon character, he came across as being a bit more stronger than that. Not to mention having Jetfire (aka Skyfire) voiced like a cockney, old man with slight dementia problems that just ruined it for me and made me wish I could have my money and those 3 hours back of my precious time! So Mr Bay if you even bother to read any of these reviews at all my message to you is this: The next time you decide to do a sequel Don't!! Just take a gun, shoot the writer and then shoot yourself to save us from the *****! you insist on churning out again and again. I honestly think that you've ruined the franchise Mr Bay I hope you are happy!!"

I've heard people defend the first film by saying 'it's a big summer action flick. What were you expecting?' Well, I was expecting, at the very least, some thread of emotional connection. I didn't get much of it from that first movie and I got even less of it from this movie. The idea that a two and a half hour movie has absolutely no character development, plot, coherent action or good humor baffles me. It feels like a kid given unlimited access to a toy store; too many robots flying across the room mindlessly. Then again, that kid could write a far better film than this one."

I was really excited for this one and was able to get into an early screening. I thought of all the possible plots and how amazing the effects would be.... but I thought wrong. First off, the films first scene is action, and then a few scenes between Fox and Shia, and then more fighting, and on and on. After about a half an hour I thought things would get better, but they just got worse. There were very few scenes with humans, mostly robot on robot mayhem. When the film ended, I couldn't comprehend what I had just seen. No story, bad acting, extraordinarily boring, and I would have to say that Transformers 2 belongs in the IMDb's Bottom 100.

"thomas_scarlett","1","5","15","30 November 2009"," A message for Michael Bay and the writers of this film.
","Dear Michael Bay and the Writers of Transformer 2 (and 1 for that matter), You were presented with a concept first developed in 1984 that had aspects of both good and bad storytelling. The good aspects I think most would agree were enough to give it great potential for a rebirth. If you researched many of the early episodes you would find some very intriguing character developments and plot points interwoven among larger universal themes. Hence the many fans of the show for which it stands head and shoulders above anything else that was directed toward kids in the 1980s. Of course the series also had it's shortcomings. There were plenty of poorly written episodes that relied too heavily on gunfights or oddball plots that really dumbed down the series and ultimately led to it's cancellation. My only explanation would be that the writers or producers of those episodes thought that kids were really stupid. Well what did you do with this storyline you were given to breath new life into. You decided to take those poor aspects of the show and run with them. This movie used every negative aspect of the show and blew it up 10 fold, namely the aforementioned over use (or bad use) of fighting, nonsensical location changes, human characters with vacant personalities, the obvious and aimless attempt of adults trying to guess what is ""cool with the kids"" (i.e. the inclusion of the two jive talking robots, this films Jar Jar Binks) etc. etc. etc. You took millions and millions of dollars and destroyed all credibility in something that could have been smart as well as visually intriguing. Either you are really stupid or you think your audience is really stupid or both. This is literally one of the worst films I have ever seen. If there was a jail for crimes against art, you guys would be given a life internment. Thanks for totally f#@king it up. I hope you enjoy your money, I'm sure you have."

Most of the Robots look so bizarre they passed alien and skipped right on to alienating. between their appearance and the absolute void of Autobot Character development or even proper introduction there was no emotional attachment to them which is kinda Odd for a movie called Transformers. The whole movie was about Shia Labouef's Struggle to cope with having the worlds hottest girlfriend and being surrounded by giant robots. He whined and moaned the whole time and there is no one in the world who sympathized. he has the best life ever and we are all struggling to pay our bills. All of this is unfortunate because the dude is really funny. And that brings us to the Humor. It wasn't clever it was just crass and let me be clear I love dirty humor but in the right place and this movie was a poor place to put it. I wanted to share this movie with my daughter who is 6 just like we shared a love of the first movie but this thing was filthy. P.S. F%&* those twin Robots! Hasn't Michael Bay Heard, Jar Jar Binks, Even Jar Jar with potty mouth is hated by all. In closing I didn't care about the characters the story was full of massive plot holes, the humor insulting, and I could go on for ever about how unwatchable the over the top special effects were, you could never follow who was fighting who.

And I got through without once mentioning the awful, awful, incredibly awful acting ""talents"" of Megan Fox, AKA worst actor I've had to sit through just because a certain group of teenage boys think she is the most beautiful thing on the planet. See the first one instead. Please. Don't give this thing any more money..... please? Do the world a favour, and help stop Micheal Bay from torturing anyone over 14, this film's enjoyment/intelligence level age limit, the world over."

","Tho I realize that this movie is made for and only for the children, i found it a complete waste of my time. Terrible script and even more terrible acting joint together create one of the worst movies i have ever seen.. And I've watched Sharktopus :) Only thing good in any of the three (new) Transformers were special effects and Megan Fox, but i do not commend her for her acting ;)<br/><br/>I mean.. Come on.. They've spent $ 150,000,000 on this movie and that's the best they've got... Seems like a waste of money to me.<br/><br/>I would NOT recommend anyone older than 10 years to watch these movies..."

","I've watched this movie on DVD this week, and all that I have to say is...Wow...It really did suck. It was just so tedious and story-lacking. I couldn't keep up with it, because so much in the movie was going on, like a typical Michael Bay movie. I nearly had the anxiety to actually put the DVD in the bin; it was that bad. They're really, REALLY pushing the 12 certificate, with the immature and cheesy humour, including the giant wrecking ball-shaped testicles that Devastator had, and the amount of humping going on. The stereotype was abysmal, for example, the twins in the movie were stereotyping American black people. With the goofy teeth and the language they use such as ""punk-ass bitch."" This epically failed as being labelled as humour. All of the dialogue was just plain awful.<br/><br/>The scenery was all just sunsets and explosions repeating themselves for nearly 3 hours. Bear in mind, I did have my earphones in at neutral volume level. The reason being is that my niece was asleep. And the ear-raping sounds still gave me an ear ache. I did have a LOT of hype for this movie, because I enjoyed the first one so much. But when I saw the full movie, I was extremely disappointed, and it made me lose my love for the whole Transformers franchise. This movie had twice as much of what the first movie had, and it was just a whole pile of scrap. No pun intended?! You bet! To conclude on a positive note...Megan Fox. Nuff said.<br/><br/>So whoever that hasn't seen this movie yet, I really do not recommend this piece of sh*t. Unless if you like to have your ears raped for 3 hours and to have the satisfactory to laugh at the dismal ""humour"" that is in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall score: 2/10. I wish I could rate it less."

","This movie simply put is just not good at all, frankly the only people who made this movie a box office success would be the special effects guys, Some of the fight scenes are pretty cool...thats where any positive review of this movie ends. The Negatives are so apparent its laughable.<br/><br/>1. Dear Megan Fox, you are indeed hot, but frankly you really have no talent at all. Michael Bay uses Fox as a piece of meat for the horny teenage guy audience. The second you see Fox in the movie, you will laugh, Apparently to fix a motorcycle you have to straddle it in a sexual pose its like Michael Bay is screaming at the audience (Megan fox is hot)!!! Thank you i get it . Believe me you will laugh when you see it.<br/><br/>2. Dear Ethan Kruger and Robert Orci( writers)......wow i must say you wrote a piece of crap script with stale unimaginative dialog and plot points. The first Transformers i actually kind of liked, but this movie is nowhere near the first one. I really just find a major fault in this movie to be the screenplay.<br/><br/>3. Dear Michael Bay, I leave my worst criticism of this movie at your hands. You focus primarily on visual effects without any attention at all at the horrible plot holes and performance of your actors. Did you really think it would be dramatic to have Shia Lebeouf scream Optimus!!! ( believe me you will laugh even harder at this poor attempt of a dramatic scene) Michael Bay needs to learn that you use special effects to enhance the environment for the story and the characters. But sadly the actual story takes a backseat to getting a cheap thrill with a robot fight. Frankly like Pearl Habor, Bay loses any sense of a cinematic responsibility.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is simply terrible, you will only be impressed by the visual effects, no thanks to Bay. For a Big Dumb Movie you have indeed found one in Transformers 2."

The characters were mostly empty as hell and uber-clichÃ©. The humor? I'm not even sure retarded monkeys will laugh at some of these jokes. I'm not a Michael Bay hater, in fact I like most of his films but this one was an extreme step down.<br/><br/>The only light spots were the always amazing John Torturro and a comic relief old-timer robot. Oh and the special effects were great of course, I have to give it points for that. But the action was so over done. If you get excited by explosions and gunfire this could be the film for you but there was so much of it that it became extremely tiring.<br/><br/>My advice is to do what I did for multiple months. Stay the hell away from it. If you see a copy scream, run and hide. This can't possibly be worth 2 and a half hour of anyone's life. This is a bad movie. 3/10."

I wasn't expecting Oscar worthy performances from anyone, but it seems like everybody mailed it in. Even the parents, who were a nice addition in the 1st movie, were extremely annoying.<br/><br/>No chance I see the forthcoming 3rd movie in this series.

","When I saw the previews for Transformers 2, I told myself not to be excited. Sequels have the tendency to be of lesser quality then the originals. But Transformers was one of my favorite movies, I watched it in the hospital after having my daughter. Even coming into Transfromers 2 with less then high hopes, I was horribly disappointed. It was mindless, with mediocre acting, no plot, and jokes not even worthy of Nickelodeon. The plot devices were so contrived that I couldn't forgive them. Sam just happened to have a piece of the Soul Spark in his backpack? When was it even in there in it's broken state? The parts concerning the military and the tracking down of Decepticons was fairly tolerable and I would've been happy to focus on that part of the movie. After all, how many times do they need to chase down Shia LeBouf while Megan Fox stands in as scenery? The worst part for me, however, were the so-called jokes. Gangster robots with gold teeth who can't read? I honestly couldn't believe that they made an ancient robot have a Scottish accent, a beard, and a cane. Really? Really? Robots need canes and grow beards? And we also have to stoop to giving them testicles and over-active sex drives? I'm not sure who this movie was aimed at, except maybe ten year-olds. But I'm hoping even ten year-olds have more taste."

","I am a big fan of the first movie and could not wait to see this second instalment to the Transformers franchise.<br/><br/>Transformers Revenge of the fallen is a very enjoyable summer blockbuster and has the potential to become a classic. This sequel to the 2007 hit Transformers and this sequel is set two years after the events of the first film and it involves Optimus Prime and the other auto bots apart from Bumblebee working along side Major Lennox in a new team called NEST to rid planet earth of the remaining Decepticons and whilst this is going on Sam is getting ready to start a new chapter in his life in college but before that happens he is packing his bags to go to college and a slither from the cube fall of a piece of his clothing from the end of the first film and warps his mind with these symbols from the Decepticons.<br/><br/>In this sequel most of the cast from the first movie return with exception from Jon Voight and Rachael Taylor. Shia LaBeouf returns with another movie that shows his acting skills improving which shows him with a promising future. Megan Fox returns as Mikaela Banes and still plays an amazing leading lady and still manages to get more and more attractive with each role she plays. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson return to add the military side of the story into thing to make it more interesting also.<br/><br/>The CGI in this film series are still there to amaze you and there are some new Robots on Both sides and towards the end of the film Devastator is introduced to the story to make things more interesting.<br/><br/>This Sequel still manages to keep you interested for the full 2 hours 30 minutes it is on screen for as the first film did and keeps the action, comedy and everything else that made the first film good plus some added thing to make this a better film than the first.<br/><br/>If you were not a big fan of the first film i would not recommend going into this one with high hopes but as i was a big fan i thoroughly enjoyed this film and look forward to the third instalment."

How could they have messed it up for the second part? Well I've finally gone to see this film, and I understand the reviews now.<br/><br/>There is a lot happening in this movie, and one or two of the story sections lasted longer than 10 minutes, so by the time it finished, some reviewers may not have been able to remember how the scene started.<br/><br/>If you're like me (and I'm 46 and remember the original incarnations) you'll enjoy this big screen live action offering.<br/><br/>If you understand the folly of nitpicking a plot that includes alien robots trashing famous Earth landmarks, you'll like it too.<br/><br/>One thing I will say further though, I've read comments criticizing releasing such a movie when people are being laid off and losing their homes etc. The original wave of Super Heroes (Superman, Batman etc) were born out of the Great Depression, because people will always want to sit down and believe in another world for a while."
"overcranked","2","4","11","6 July 2009"," Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the second film in the Transformer series about the famous Hasbro toy line. We pick back up with Shia LaBeouf (Disturbia, Eagle Eye), reprising his role as Sam WitWicky, two years after the first Transformers film preparing to head off to college. Megan Fox (Transformers, How to Lose Friends and Alienate People) returns as his girlfriend, Mikaela Banes. Sam stumbles upon a fragment of the Allspark, which broke off and was hidden among his things after the final battle of the first film. This discovery will lead to the Autobots having to battle their oldest foe the Fallen.<br/><br/>There are two things that can define this film, or any Michael Bay film, explosions and slow motion. In fact the explosions at times happen when it doesn't seem possible, like when a robot flies through the wall of an apartment. This pales in comparison to the blatant ethnic stereotypes that are two of the new Autobots, Mudflap and Skids. These two characters are grating they are such awful stereotypes of ""urban"" people. Add to them the needless shots of dogs humping and the repeated use of profanity for a cheap laugh and you see the age group Bay was aiming for: 13-18 year old boys. He also relies on Judy Witwicky for comic relief when none is needed, and in fact abuses her for such a purpose. Comedy and slap stick just do not seem to be something Michael Bay really understands. While these elements were able to get the 13 to 18 year old kids in the audience to laugh it fell very flat to me. In fact he seemed to be trying too hard to get me to laugh with his attempts at comedy.<br/><br/>One of the things Bay gets right in the film is giving us extended fight sequences of the Autobots and Decepticons. However, while we see long takes of these battles the actions of the humans in the scene seemed forgotten as they would seem to magically get from A to B without the audience seeing anything. This made the film seem jumpy and almost fractured to such a degree that it began to make it hard to follow even with such a plain plot. Also it seems that Megan Fox is employed as a distraction for the audience in the film from what is actually on the screen. It was effective as the 13-18 demographic cat called at the screen whenever she bent over or did anything slightly sexual. It is almost as if Bay knew he had a weak story and tried to use a type of slide of hand to distract us from the flaws throughout the film.<br/><br/>The strongest part of the film actually was Shia Labeouf's performance. While it won't be remembered as his best work he shines through the film and actually pulls off his role. Sure the dialogue was not always great and the editing left holes in the film, but LaBeouf overcomes these with his acting. In fact his acting is far better in the sequel than in the first film when a good number of his lines were reduced to, ""No no no no!"" However, the chemistry between Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox just left me wanting more from them. It came across very flimsy and flat to the point that it made me wonder why they bothered calling each other ""Babe."" Even with that the film is beautiful in visual terms with special effects that dazzle the eye and led to many ""Did you see that!""'s being spoken in the audience. It is to Michael Bay's credit that he uses so many explosions because at least it gives us something to watch that works in the film.<br/><br/>In the final rundown Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen simply falls short of the intended goal. If you aren't looking for much from a movie you won't be disappointed, but in the end the only things working for the movie are the special effects, Shia LaBeouf's acting, and Megan Fox running in slow motion. Aside from that you won't find much here. In fact this well is dry, very dry. Even with it being a dry well Bay manages to stretch the film a good 30 minuets longer than it deserves with it's plot. The only way to describe the plot is as shallow, and fun, as a kiddie pool.<br/><br/>Written by Josh for www.overcranked.net"

","What do you do when it is politically incorrect to make fun of African Americans on T.V.? Answer: Change them into machines mimicking African Americans and portraying racist stereotypes. I was shocked when watching Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen, to see two robots, complete with ghetto behavior, ""jive"" talking, random fighting, and gold teeth to be what I saw as a blatant stereotype of African Americans. At one point when the robot was asked if he could translate some Hieroglyphics written in the language of the Primes (Optimus Prime's ancestry) he said, ""Nah man, I don't read."" Excuse me???? I cringed every time that I saw the characters. Another robot who had a black voice also repeatedly used incorrect grammar, stating, when it was time to parachute to Eygpt, ""we best be getting' off dis plane."" However, we were not the only people insulted in this movie. Women, Latinos, those of Middle Eastern origin, children, intelligent people, and people who paid to see the film were also victims of this so-called blockbuster. First of all, women. Megan Fox was portrayed as a brainless sycophant whose only desire in life was to love Sam/Shia I don't understand why Megan, a.k.a. Makaela, was not in a community college and her only option in life was to beg Shia Lebouf to love her??? From recent interviews, the girl obviously has a mind and likes to use it. I personally would have like to have seen some of her spunky personality on the big screen instead of her face in people's crotches (yes, it did happen) and a robot humping her leg (again, I am not making this up). All the other women were also stereotypes, no doubt created in the sexually starved minds of the nerds who wrote this out of touch and surprising disappointing film. The mom had really funny moments which ran into overkill when she ate weed filled brownies, tackled a college guy, and told the dad, ""hey professor, I would do anything for an A."" The movie would have been better served if she had tried to eat the brownies and Shia had taken them from her with his usual one-liner. They tried to stir up a conflict for Mikaela and Shia by hiring a blond model who slightly rivaled Megan's one of a kind looks, but it ended in stupidity better left completely out of the movie. If they really wanted a conflict, they should have had a hunky guy hired to help with her dad's car shop while Mikaela went to school and Shia is jealous. That is more realistic. Then they could have had a smart girl be a road companion through their road adventures. I could go on about how they could have made this better, but I need a paycheck first. Latinos were insulted by having a dumb, roommate, side-kick who only cried, pulled down his pants, and got into random sexual positions with men. Last time I checked, making fun of a person's sexual orientation isn't funny either. People of Middle East origins were insulted when Shia and company tried to cross the border lines. First of all, they made a midget the head person in charge. Why is being shorter funny? Was it supposed to get a cheap laugh? Did the writers think that was funny? Then, the border police let them pass through when they found out that he was from New York, as if he would be that stupid. The crazy, meat-shop, former sector 7 guy told him as he was passing,""you look like the guy that makes my falafels."" The craziness doesn't end. The movie had so much cursing and sexual innuendos that I was disgusted. I felt bad for parents who thought that they were taking their children to ""family-friendly"" movie. Dogs were humping dogs, cars said ""suck my popsicle"", Megan Fox was humped by a robot, Megan Fox landed face down on a guys groin area, professors made lewd comments at girls in class, all girls on the college campus were naked, half-naked, or about to be naked, there was a make out scene were a girl's dress rises up and her underwear is shown, dirty robots, dirty robot parts, and even Shia's mom says uncharacteristic things and gets her butt slapped. The cursing was out of control. Everyone was cursing, especially the robots. They were cursing when it made better sense not to curse or even speak at all. Intelligent people were insulted in this movie. A lot of things didn't make sense. Where did the hot-girl transformer come from and why didn't she kill him and take his memory on one of the gazillion chances that she had? When did the Decepticons start making human cyborgs? How did the blond model transformer know that Shia was in college? How did she get enrolled and in his classes? If she knew that much, couldn't she have killed him a more convenient and earlier time? That could have been left out of the movie. Why did the guy sent to shut down the Transformers release all the key information that the Decepticons needed in less than thirty seconds? Aren't there code words in the National Defense? How did Shia find time to go to a hospital and bandage his arm when they were running from the bad robots? How can someone be dropped, in a car, over five hundred feet, head first, through a building roof, crash, with a head-on collision on to the concrete below, and all passengers are not only saved by the air bag, but they get out of the car and run? Last, but not least, why were the college freshman, on average, 35 years old? Basically, anyone who has seen this movie and people above the age of three are owed an apology for this horrible let-down. To leave on a positive note, the computer graphics staff did a good job and thank you for helping me understand how robots procreate."

","Let me get straight to the point. There is NO plot. The action shots are so close, you have no idea which robot is a good guy, or a bad guy. This movie makes absolutely no sense. If Sam all of a sudden does not want to help the transformers, why does he still keep bumble bee in his garage? Why does the all spark turn every piece of electronics into decepticons? Why does the US all of a sudden want to discontinue the help of the autobots? One of the decepticons takes the form of a human female. Lame. Most of the robot fighting scenes are small robots, not the big ones. And last of all, the way the ""problem"" is dealt with is done way to easy. And i mean come on, the pyramids? Really?

One of the worst part was all the new transformers were dumb. There were 2 twin robots that were supposed 2 be black, they had a gold tooth (Which i felt unnecessary because the other transformers don't have teeth so), and they said punk a$$ b1tch every time u see them (not Shure if u can cuss on here). I am white, but this was racist and unnecessary. also I don't mind language in movies. my favorite comedy is Superbad, but I thought this was a kid movie I mean there was more language in this then most PG-13 movies and some R movies. I also found the dogs humping unnecessary and the robot humping Megen Fox's leg. Also all the Decepticons looked alike i often couldn't tell the diff between Starscreen and Megatron. Like I said this movie is too drawn out i literally almost fell asleep like 4 times and I never fell asleep in the theater.

"dfranzen70","4","4","11","27 June 2009"," Don't be deceived - it's loud but generally worthless
","This cacophonous sequel to the 2007 blockbuster is a relentlessly incomprehensible mess. Alleged director Michael Bay, a firm believer in the throw-everything-at-the-wall theory of film-making, manages to overwhelm the senses with a teeth-rattling soundtrack and a blistering, epilepsy-inducing barrage of metallic imagery. Oh, there's a story in there, something about preventing an evil robot from destroying the sun, but it's almost completely irrelevant.<br/><br/>Since the movie is a direct follow up to the last Transformers film, some background is necessary. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBoeuf) is preparing to go to college, away from his new sweetheart Mikaela (Megan Fox) and his new alien robot best friend, Bumblebee. Meanwhile, Optimus Prime (a good robot) is helping the world's armies take on stray Decepticons (bad robots), who are trying to revive their old leader Megatron, find Sam, and aid another bad robot named The Fallen (see what they did there?).<br/><br/>Most of the scenes involve Sam (and Mikaela, and others in their posse) running from place to place, getting shot at by apparently the slowest giant robots in the universe. But not like in films like National Treasure or Angels and Demons, where a mystery was being solved and the protagonist was running from place to place because time was almost up for them to solve said mystery. More like running around just so that more robot battle scenes could be included. I mean, it doesn't really have to have a point, right? One big problem is that the robots are sort of hard to distinguish from one another. Some are pretty easy, like Optimus Prime (he's blue and red) and Bumblebee (he's yellow), and the Twins Mudflap and Skids, or even The Fallen, who has an elongated faceplate. There are gray-metal robots who are Decepticons (colorless = evil?), but then there are some who are Autobots. Add to this confusion the fact that the fight scenes move at a breakneck pace, so even if you can tell who's fighting whom, you really can't tell what specifically is being done.<br/><br/>The movie is also about an hour too long (it's two and a half hours total). There are too many battle scenes anyway, and there are too many characters to keep track of. Slice it down to a manageable running time and chop out some secondary characters - keep the battles to just the most obvious players - and maybe there would be a coherent, cohesive movie. But Michael Bay directed this, and he's known for doing the opposite of what a good filmmaker would do.<br/><br/>As for the acting... well, I don't want to be negative. I'm kidding, of course I do. Being negative is easier than being positive. But it's double-plus easier for a film like this, because it's so clichéd and so overwrought. The acting is subpar; everyone hams it up, probably because they don't want to be overshadowed by robots. (They are anyway.) LaBoeuf is not a good actor, never has been. He's not a good action-movie type, frankly; you don't look at him and see hero, you see nincompoop. He doesn't inspire so much as react. This was never more evident than in the latest Indiana Jones movie, when sixtysomething Harrison Ford - not a great actor, but an appealing one - was far more convincing than LaBoeuf. You're supposed to look at LaBoeuf and think he's a guy next door, and instead you look at him and think he's a self-aggrandizing little twit. Or maybe that's just me.<br/><br/>Megan Fox is in this movie basically to look pretty - check out, as I did, the endless pans over her young, lithe body, and you know exactly who's in the intended audience. (Note: It's not sixty-year-old women.) The appropriately named Fox is all pouty lips and gleaming teeth, and she's likable enough, but she's given little to do other than dote on LaBoeuf awkwardly.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, it's a clash of acting styles. John Turturro returns as Agent Simmons, and he's wackier than ever; Ramon Rodriguez plays Sam's new college roommate, web entrepreneur Leo, and he's deranged and a wuss. Sam's parents are played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White, who shamelessly mug - White's character in particular is needlessly loony. She was probably supposed to be comic relief, but she comes off as annoying.<br/><br/>This isn't a great thrill ride, as the previews might lead you to believe. It's not even a Mr. Toad's Wild Ride. It's more like the It's a Small World ride, a ride that ceaselessly repeats the same refrain just to irritate the pants off you, figuratively speaking, resulting in a desperate wish for it all to be over."
"tknice","4","4","11","27 June 2009"," What happened?
","After reading so many comments here, it's obvious that there are two different types of people going to see this movie--people looking for action (albeit probably looking for Megan fox as well) and those looking for action with a good story or at least one comparable to the first.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie starts out great with lots of action and many genuinely funny moments with Sam's parents. Sam is seduced by a college girl named Alice (played by Isabel Lucas) who does a good job with her role. We learn about two separate slivers of the all-spark which is pretty close to where the story takes a nose dive.<br/><br/>I won't go into much more detail about the story, or lack there of, since there are other big reasons why this movie failed me. Two words: the twins. These two robots reminded me exactly of Jar Jar Binks in Episode I. Adding more human personality to these robots was a mistake, particularly when dialog is so poorly written. Here's what Michael Bay said: ""The twins are quite fun,"" he said of the comedy- relief duo Mudflap and Skids. ""I just kept thinking, 'What if we have two dumb Transformers that are young and dumb?' They are just irreverent, dumb Transformers."" No, just no!<br/><br/>By the way, poorly written dialog and cheesy dramatic moments was a theme in the third act causing it to drag...on and on.<br/><br/>Another criticism I have is how close much of the action was framed. There were countless action scenes where it was hard to tell exactly what I looking at. It was a jumbled metallic mess.<br/><br/>I did have a few favorite scenes in the movie. The forest scene was particularly well done. I think the landscape helped the composition of that whole sequence, it was awesome. There were plenty more great action sequences throughout the movie but it began to feel relentless. I'm such an Action/Sci-Fi fan that I was surprised to feel this way.

"carlos-linares","3","4","11","24 June 2009"," Lots of ""boom"" with no soul
","I walked into 'Transformers 2' expecting to have the same mindless summer fun I got two years ago with the original movie... and I got mindless, alright.<br/><br/>I wonder who told Michael Bay that making an action movie consists of slamming as many action sequences in as little time as possible, with no plot whatsoever? Everything that made 'Transformers' a great summer movie is either lost or overkilled in this one: the story is almost non-existent and silly, the characters (both on the human and robot side of things) feel dull and the new ones are irrelevant, the script introduces a bunch of plot points that go nowhere and just add irrelevance to the already too long movie, including an attempt to a ""jealousy arc"" between Sam and Mikaela that ends in the most absurd way possible, and so quickly that you wonder why was it there in the first place; the comedy is overdone in a shameful way: from the 800,000 intended jokes they land 4 or 5, and the return of Sam's parents is useless: this time they're not even annoying in an entertaining way.<br/><br/>I'd like to think that the writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman were too busy doing 'Star Trek' to really pay attention to this movie, because otherwise; I'm gonna have to say they failed miserably on this attempt. This is way too brain-dead to make it enjoyable and this time you don't empathize with any of the good guys and don't buy any of the bad guys as a serious villain for more than 3 minutes. Sure, there is a ton of giant robot carnage; but it never seems transcendent. (Tiny spoiler to come) Devastator, who initially comes as this huge, scary threat suffers from what a friend of mine smartly called ""stormtrooper syndrome"", and ended up being comedic relief and dying in a totally anti-climactic way. Even the new supposed ""ultimate villain"" is got a minor role in the film and you don't buy him for a second.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend seeing this to anyone who is looking for even a little piece of wit in a movie. Watch the trailers and teasers instead and they'll give you everything that is worthy about the movie; and save yourself the money for movie tickets."

","The first Transformers was a fun,rather silly action film, which got just about everything right. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of the sequel. Bigger does not mean better and in this film everything on screen is bigger but that does not mean better.<br/><br/>The acting is OK and the special effects are very good, but do not feel any more impressive than the first film. Unfortunately the script is rather weak and way to long. The worst part of the film is that it feels like one long advert for the toy line and is all the worst for it.<br/><br/>Overall the film is OK but it should have been much better and for me one of the bigger disappointment in a film which has had a lot of rather average and bad films."
"Installation_At_Orsk","5","4","11","20 June 2009"," The same... only more so
","You pretty much know what you're going to get with a Michael Bay movie by now. It's HUGE! Everything EXPLODES! The camera SPINS! It's LOUD! Revenge Of The Fallen takes this to the logical limit with two and a half hours of EXTREME BAYHEM! But bigger isn't necessarily better.<br/><br/>The first Transformers movie has grown on me over time - there's a lot wrong with it, and some of its flaws (like having far too many obnoxious 'comic relief' characters and some borderline offensive racial caricatures) are admittedly dealt with the second time round. But it had a relatively straightforward plot, and underlying it all was a Spielbergian ""a boy and his..."" story, in this case his first car. The sequel, on the other hand, is about, er...<br/><br/>That's the biggest problem with Revenge - it's just a MacGuffin hunt, but in this case each MacGuffin leads only to another MacGuffin. The shard leads to the symbols which lead to the Sector 7 files which lead to Jetfire who leads to the Pyramids which lead to the Matrix which leads back to the Pyramids which contain the... There's no ingenuity in following the trail, either - Sam and co make arbitrary deductions that of course turn out to be right, are flat-out told what to do next (Jetfire is by far the most entertaining character in the film, but he's also lumbered with a colossal amount of exposition) or, laziest of all, make crucial discoveries by sheer accident.<br/><br/>The same applies to the various battles; baddies turn up, are dealt with using big guns, bigger baddies turn up, are dealt with using bigger guns, and so on. No tactics, no using an enemy's weaknesses against him, no tricking him into making a mistake - just more and louder bang-bang. I generally love Big Dumb Action Movies, but after a couple of hours of this I was just numb to the whole thing - and there was still half an hour to go before the climax!<br/><br/>The returning characters are actually *less* developed than in the first film because they pretty much have nothing to do except follow the clues, run and/or fight. Other than Jetfire, the new characters fare even less well. The Twins (who act and sound like Master Shake and Meatwad from Aqua Teen Hunger Force) accompany Sam for about a third of the entire film, but there's no real reason for them to be there other than bicker like idiots. And the title villain, the Fallen, is a generic growling bad guy who wants to destroy the world basically because he's a jerk. Most of the other new Decepticons don't even get names.<br/><br/>Like the first movie, this will probably be easier to follow on a smaller screen because the robots are again shot too close and cut too fast. On the big screen, scenes like the forest battle are blurs of pixels with the occasional moment where the action slows to show off a money shot, then goes back to being a whirling mess of metal. (Still, on the plus side at least it's not shaky-cam.)<br/><br/>The whole thing is impressive in that every penny spent is up there on the screen, and some of the visuals are pretty spectacular (though oddly, the gimmick of the title - that the robots can transform into vehicles and back - feels downplayed this time. Optimus and Bumblebee have a couple of hero transformations each, but there are no real jawdroppers like Blackout or Bonecrusher in the first film). Sam's parents are a lot funnier and less annoying than before, and Megatron and Starscream's master/servant relationship is also quite a laugh. But beneath all the gloss, there's no heart, no soul and no brain. Like a robot... in disguise."

","The ideas in this film for the introduction and use of new characters are fantastic! Soundwave, Ravage, Constructicons, Devastator - wonderful additions and the shape and form of these are superb.<br/><br/>The twins on the Auto-bot side are good comedy characters also and along with Sideswipe,and the characters we got to know 1st time round, work brilliantly.<br/><br/>The problem with this movie is that the human characters are totally wasted in the script - both the military group N.E.S.T and Sam etc. The reason for this is that this film does too much - the material here could round out the trilogy! This film should have been about recovering Megatron from the depths of the ocean along with the other casualties from the first film. The Decepticons regrouping under Starscream off-world, Introducing the FALLEN as the supreme being on the Decepticon side and the Decepticons undermining the Auto-bots and manoeuvrings to subvert the humans through the guidance of Soundwave in his inspired new form as a Satellite, was so pleased with this. The assault on the human base by Ravage co-ordinated by Soundwave should have been the set piece of the movie - all the espionage agents from Soundwave's arsenal should have been involved i.e. Frenzy, Rampage, Ravage, Nightstalker, Laserbeak, Buzzsaw and Ratbat. When Ravage opened up with his mini-guns and missiles I thought it was smart - imagine that x2 with air support and Fenzy/Rampage doing a fighting retreat with the item recovered - epic! <br/><br/>I always liked Jetfire as a character - Decepticon turned Autobot - a formidable fighter and at some points a little ambiguous. In this film it was good up until he transformed and acted like an old man - rubbish.<br/><br/>This movie should have been literally 'revenge of the fallen' and ended with the Decpticons winning the Fallen returned, Megatron reanimated and Optimus Prime slain in an epic battle with Starscream, Megatron AND the Fallen. The 3rd movie in the series should have been the battle in the Egyptian/Jordanian desert with devastator coming to the fore, the matrix, the return of Optimus Prime and the plot of the fallen coming out and then being defeated. Now these movies would have smashed the box office for all time! The Fallen in ancient times should have originally been defeated by the Dinobots - now that would have been epic and a proper use of such great characters - the SAS of the auto-bots - it would have fit the time-line and worked awesome.<br/><br/>Just my ideas, movie is 6 out of 10, I rate the first movie an 8 because I thought it was just brilliant and kept it simple and introduced us to fantastic characters. This one loses marks by ruining plot ideas and characters but still looks brilliant and definitely entertains.<br/><br/>Small point how can the Constructicons be involved in the assault on the humans when theoretically they are all formed up as devastator at the time? Motormaster, Mixmaster and at least 2 others are seen whilst devastator is doing his thing!?<br/><br/>Mr Bay you make great looking films and you get the look right every time but in terms of telling a story and using characters and developing plot - you still suck! <br/><br/>If Orci and Kurtzman had not been out of action with the writers strike this film would have been way better put together. How did the 'Comedy' transformers get past the hardcore at hasbro - were they drugged and tied up that day?"
"nicholls905-280-546911","3","2","4","9 December 2019"," Messy sequel
","The first film delivered a decent action film, but sadly this is a giant mess. The action scenes are still good and the cast are quite good together, it's the incoherent plot that kills momentum. Bay is over the top and cannot reign in the action to a basic level. The robots fight endlessly and the character's are left with very little to offer. This is a bad franchise film and evidence that too much of everything is not a great thing. The filmmaker has even admitted it sucked, what else can I say."
"Angelika_New_York","1","2","4","5 June 2017"," Revenge of the Fallen; a disaster movie indeed.
","So there is a new upcoming Transformers movie out later this month, which strangely has me reflect on its series. I choose to do a review for this one because it is outlandishly bad; so bad in fact while watching it, it made question if the first one was really any good.<br/><br/>My expectations were pretty low in regards to the first one, which is probably how I ending up liking it. I felt as though the 2007 Transformers is more of a chase movie. Actually they all are, really. However it is the one that is mostly straightforward, in my opinion. It mostly reminded me a lot of Steven Spielberg's War of the Worlds, which is one of my favorite movies.<br/><br/>Anyway although I understand Revenge of the Fallen was really hyped when it was released and even though I liked the first one, I had zero interest. It was even the number one film at the box office for two weeks! Two weeks! And until Avatar was released six months later, this was the HIGHEST grossing movie of 2009. <br/><br/>I can honestly tell you that there are not a lot of movies that I can say I hate, but this one I hateabsolutely. Not one good thing about it. There is someone whom I am a subscriber to on YouTube who has recently reviewed this movie and although there is a lot he did not like about it, I still feel like he was being a little too easy on it. This film doesn't even look good; there is an extreme intensity of colors. And it's just loud! Non-stop clanging of metal. Can't even tell who is fighting who after a while, much less care. In the end, it is just a noisy, big, bloated, convoluted mess with so much saturation of colors. It literally becomes an assault on the senses. Well, isn't that what to expect from Michael Bay's vision of Transformers? This is by no means Academy Award material. I understand that but if you're going to make a mindless action movie, at least make one that is worth watching. There is no need for this crap to be 2 ½ hours long. There is also no need for gratuitous shots of a skimpily dressed Megan Fox, or John Turturro's ass, or robotic testicles. I didn't even know Rainn Wilson was in this, or perhaps I just forgot. And Shia LeBeouf's roommate in the movie is soerratic, which is incredibly annoying. This movie goes on way too long and with so many subplots. Also, his parents should have had screen time reduced as little as possible. I didn't like them much in the first movie either. None of these movies need to have such a big comic relief and none of it is funny. It all just comes across as so embarrassing. That's how I felt when I watched it, which was on cable. I could never throw my money down the drain on seeing this in a theatre. I guess that's the way it is with these movies: ""Run to the aliens, run from the aliens, run to the aliens"" Something like that. I always liked that quote."
"twpain","6","0","0","26 June 2020"," A decent film
","The second Transformers movie is decent but has its issues. The action scenes were explosive and the film is never boring but some scenes seem a little out of place and just plain out weird. The story has its moments but the romance part of it just dose not work. Revenge of the Fallen does have some really good sequences but also has some weird out of place moments."
"pzazz_hij","3","6","20","19 June 2009"," Sorry Mr. Bay, you've let us down...
","The first Transformers movie, despite its few problems, managed to do what everyone wanted it to do... Entertain! The original transformers, comics or TV show, very rarely ventured into a great story or even exceptional originality. But what made it work was its simplicity and entertainment value. Two opposing sides of an alien race that can each transform into various vehicles (or weapons, in the case of Megatron) and battle it out over planet earth, whether they were fighting for the Autobot matrix or energon the concept was the same. And, one of the best things about the impact of the original movie was how Optimus Prime ended it with 'a lot like us humans are more than meets the eye', which gives the film and gave the cartoon depth.<br/><br/>Much like the cartoon, the first film took that concept and introduced these Transformers (both Autobots and Deceptacons) as their own characters and gave them a bit of space to develop. The story was the simplest and correct one, both sides wanted the allspark and a young human is caught in the middle. Let the action do the rest...<br/><br/>This time, the Autobots and the military have joined forces to make a special unit to hunt and destroy the Deceptacons on earth. Optimus Prime informs the military chiefs that he believes the Deceptacons are looking for something, which is why they are still on Earth. Meanwhile, Sam is about to depart for college and discovers that he has a small shard of the allspark. Once the Deceptacons discover this and the location of Megatron they set about retrieving the shard and the secret it held which was accidentally unlocked by Sam.<br/><br/>So, the plot is basically the same as the original, the young boy has the key to total destruction of earth and the only ones in the way of the Deceptacons and him are the Autobots.<br/><br/>This is not a problem! The problem is the rest of the story, which i got lost in quite prominently, i didn't know who i was meant to be following or why and even when i was sure the whole scene seemed to move to a completely new area without any acknowledgement of it.<br/><br/>The development of the overall story needs to be kept in check, in this case the story lies with its human stars who don't have enough of a formal interaction with the Transformers to develop. Also, the new Autobots and Deceptacons come in from nowhere and we are supposed to know which side they are on. The thing is we want to know about these transformers, we enjoyed learning about them in the first one it just didn't happen enough, here it doesn't happen at all and it is a huge problem. The fans of the Transformers will know who's who but for a basic audience they have no idea who or what is going on. The new Autobots are never introduced, they are simply there, we don't even know what there names are by the end of the film. I know of Arcee, who was a rather popular member after her debut in the Transformers animated movie, and the twins, who actually manage to get some screen time to themselves, but we want to know a bit more of them.<br/><br/>As for the Deceptacons, its more or less the same thing. We are subtly introduced to the Deceptacon Hound, which is actually quite nice, but its first scene leads to nowhere and leaves a huge loose end in the story. The character of The Fallen is the only real introduction we get, which at least is one of the tings that works in this film. The resurrection of Megatron kinda speaks for itself and does work.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the special effects are amazing! If there is any reason that people should see this film it is the scope of the action and how well the special effects make it happen. The action itself is too simple, which i was so surprised at considering its a Michael Bay film. Nothing really happens for long enough, the best action scene is a very nicely filmed battle in a forest which is easily the most exciting part of the film. The rest is not looked at closely enough and contains too much fast cut editing between military commanders giving orders and not what we paid to see... Autobots vs Deceptacons! The film is supposed to be about the Transformers, not the humans who are stood in between (or around) the Transformers. The humans take up too much screen time and don't let the robots have any.<br/><br/>The film is much darker and more focused on the evil force of the Deceptacons, not in the best way however. The action scenes are more intense, i will give it that, but when it meets with an unbalanced story to action ratio the problems start to arise. The very little story thats there is attempted to be thickened when its not necessary, if it was kept simple and all the loose ends were tied we would have had much more fun from this film, but as it is we don't get anything that is worth the hype.<br/><br/>Better luck with the next one Mr. Bay..."

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) is a perfect example of a movie that's sole purpose is to make mo'money for the studio (and that's exactly what the film did). The film gave the audience everything that was already seen in the first film, this time just in a much more bigger scale than before – it was like an updated version of the first Trasformers (2007) with no original ideas to add.<br/><br/>Where the first film was OK brainless fun, this one is not; the jokes, the action, the story – everything feels very much forced and pre-calculated, there's no surprises or any signs of imagination or real effort. I consider Michael Bay to be a decent director and great in making what he does best; cheesy Hollywood action movies (like The Rock (1996)), but Transformers 2 just feels so tedious and breathless that it was even a bit of a surprise considering who was holding the reins.<br/><br/>There's not much to the story: Sam Witwicky (played by Shia LeBeouf) goes off to college, comes across with some important information about the Transformers' ancient past and then get's chased by all kinds of shape shifting robots... A lot of explosions accompanied with cheesy music ensues. The rest of the cast from the first movie makes a return, though most of them having little if anything to do on the screen, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) being the most obvious example. The cast does a decent job but the enthusiasm found in the first film was all gone, the often ridiculous dialog possibly being one reason for that.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 lacks a real script and real effort which made the film unsalvageable even by the good visuals the film has to offer through-out. The explosions and the robots all look good but made hollow by the mindlessness of it all: the film's like a picture gallery or a showcase of what's possible to do in today's CGI with no meaning beyond that point. I had a horrible experience with the film. 1/4"

She is very hot no doubt but there was no need to close up on her face every time she said something. Besides that the movie was unreal. It had an amazing amount of action and the plot was unreal. The twin robots were absolutely hilarious and I was upset they didn't shoot more of the little robot that was captured he was hilarious. The only other complaint is the roommate.

"roddickrocker21","3","4","12","24 June 2009"," Michael Bay has done it again: and ""it"" is garbage.
","I'll say this right off the bat: I didn't like the first film. I thought it was mostly dull, made little sense, and mostly just an excuse to have chunks of metal thrown at each other. However, after watching this sequel, I almost want to watch the original again just to get the bad taste of out my mouth.<br/><br/>This movie, really, deserves only 1 star. The story is beyond clichÃ©d (bad guys want to destroy the universe). The dialogue is terrible, always trying to be funny or cute but always at the wrong time. The acting is sub-par, although I can't blame Shia LaBouef for taking a job in a money-maker like this. Many of the elements of this film sound like a 6 year old wrote it off the top of their head: for example, at one point for no apparent reason, the entire crew of protagonists just teleport to the middle of a desert. No warning. Nothing ever referred back to it. They just teleport. I laughed out loud.<br/><br/>Another major problem is the blatant humorless racism that is prevalent throughout the entire movie. The characters travel around the world, giving the writers and Michael Bay a chance to throw out every ridiculous stereotype that they can: French people eating snails, Black people with golden teeth, Arabic people who are short and envy Americans (Is that even a stereotype? It sure appeared as one). I usually don't mind racial humor, but frankly, this isn't humor, this is just ignorant bigotry.<br/><br/>I'm giving the film 3 stars because, honestly, it looks very good. The action scenes, few there are, are directing a bit better than the prequel, so I could enjoy them a bit more. Granted, it is often hard to tell which transformers are the Autobots (good guys) and which are the Decepticons (evil guys), but it is satisfying just to see action considering how boring and senseless most of the rest of the movie is. The visual effects are very good, albeit again sometimes hard to distinguish. The production value is very summer-movie-esquire.<br/><br/>If you want to see a fun summer movie, go see Star Trek again. Go watch Terminator Salvation, which maybe wasn't perfect, but is far better than this. If you are a major Transformers fan, I personally am not, I would wait and rent it. Even if you liked the first one, I have serious doubts that this movie will satisfy you. There are plenty of things that added to the atrocity of this film (robots with testicles, robots that can turn into people, inconsistency with language, plot holes), but I'll try to keep this shorter than the two-and-a-half hours I just spent watching this garbage. It really appears as a film made by six year olds, for six year olds, yet six year olds who think racism and bad sexual references are hilarious. Avoid this one, I say."

","5 out of 10 is being generous. Not because of the acting or special effects. Those were all great, but... <br/><br/>I couldn't enjoy the movie because it was soooooo full of constant cussing and sexuality. <br/><br/>The first movie had a little of both, but this has a lot and it's too much, especially when you consider that this is marketed to kids. I mean come on, Wheelie humping the girls leg? Get a life! And how many times do we need to see dogs humping? And the man with the thong... totally unnecessary. Is that as original as the writers can be. That's not transformers, it's smut.<br/><br/>As an adult I didn't want all of that in a transformers movie. As a dad it down right offends me. <br/><br/>There were so many degrading, foul, and perverted things that it totally robbed me of the joy of the story line and action. <br/><br/>Story line- this was okay. Continuity wasn't there. Lot's of inconsistencies and contradictions. They could've taken out all the time spent on cussing and sexual stuff and actually focused more on the robots. Come on, it's called transformers. I liked the idea, just wish they would've done more with it. And the whole ""heaven"" ending didn't make any sense. I also would've liked to have seen a few more auto-bots in the story.<br/><br/>Special effects - Really really cool. Awesome stuff.<br/><br/>Action - Tons of action.<br/><br/>Characters - I liked them all, they did a good job, but what happened to Megan Fox? Did she go plastic trying to look like Angelina Jolie? She didn't need to, she was a beautiful person the way she was, now she looks like a ""wanna be"". I kept looking at her thinking she doesn't even look the same. Is that what Hollywood does to people?<br/><br/>Transformers - Devastator was a major disappointment. Sorry, but prowling around like an animal isn't gonna cut it. What happened to being a real threat? Jet Fire being old and needing a cane was stupid. He's supposed to be big and tough, like the Fallen. <br/><br/>I'd love to see them make a third one that actually is family friendly and about transformers, not some smut film that's marketed to kids using toys and cool previews of really cool robots to suck them in."

","Transformers 2 is OK at best but fails to live up to expectations after seeing the fantastic first one. The effects are great as well as the fight scenes but other than that it's really nothing special. It failed to get me excited at all, didn't have the ""wow"" factor so to speak. The movie was really dull, as much as I wanted to get into it I simply couldn't. They really overused Megan Fox in this movie as well, went completely out of their way to show her hotness. I love Megan Fox and all but even when she was ripping off her clothes at one point and hearing the men in the theater all yelling ""wooooo!"" I sat there thinking ""what the eff does this have to do with anything?"" I came to see a movie, if I came to see Megan Fox I would have stayed at home and used a thing called the internet. Overall it was an OK movie but the disappointment overruled the movie itself.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","1","3","8","4 November 2016"," A disgrace to one of the world's defining mediums: cinema.
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is Michael Bay's ball-sack; it smells awful, looks awful and he keeps shoving his ego right in your face; this movie is as horrible as the man's directing skills. He can't actually direct movies. He's an effects-slave.<br/><br/>Revenge of the Fallen is a feature-length headache that makes big-budget blockbusters look all-round bad, even though a lot of them are never THIS bad. This is like below rock bottom for a film to go. There is no plot, the acting sucks, the visual effects whilst being complex don't make for pretty sights for the eye. The Autobots are CGI-ed excretions of effects whenever they're fighting Decepticons. This film promotes cinematic ugliness instead of cinematic beauty. It doesn't even try to show 'beauty through ugliness' like The Elephant Man did; Revenge of the Fallen is just ugliness incarnate.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there are thousands of other movies to watch readers, and I promise you that THEY don't offer headaches like this one did for me. If you want a real movie, watch Inglorious Basterds or Django Unchained. Go and watch the 1985 Transformers The Movie (or the original show) instead of Michael Bay's steaming multi-million-dollar turds.<br/><br/>To sum it up: stay away from this 80s mocking rubbish."

Most people already mentioned the awful dialogue, jokes, plot, acting, etc. So I will just focus on a different thing. Michael Bay took away ALL we loved about the Transformers. The original TFs were a group of badass giant robots, yes. But they ALL had a personality, a look, a distinguishing feature. Let's stay within Decepticon confines. Starscream's jealousy of Megatron, Soundwave's loyalty and dryness, Skywarp's teleport, Rumble and Frenzy's punk kids behaviour, Dirge's mean streak, Blitzwing's love of his own firepower, the Insecticons, the Constructicons, Astrotrain, Reflector, Thundercracker, Laserbeak, etc, etc. And you could TELL THEM APART. Here they are just expendable masses of twisted metal. That - even worse - are easily defeated by human troops. As far as I could remember, Decepticons always had the upper hand in these exchanges.<br/><br/>I watched this movie on a night-in with some friends. I want to kill M. Bay by the time it was over. Avoid it like the plague and keep your love for the original TFs safe and sound."

I am sick of reading about how bad this movie because that is just one of the dumbest things I've heard all year. This movie has some of the best action sequences we've seen in a movie in a long time. I believe that Michael Bay has done a great job engineering this very entertaining movie. Maybe the people who decide to write these reviews should learn something about good film making. I've read that this movie has a lagging story, I believe it is very gripping story and I can't believe you can tell me that you weren't shocked when optimus Prime was killed. I do believe a big weakness in the movie is the acting by Megan fox, she is not a good actress and does not belong in this awesome movie.

","I do not know why this movie did not gain good popularity. I mean I was highly impressed with the movie. The visuals, the fight scenes, sound effects, the explosions- everything was great. The best thing about this movie was of course the fight scenes. There are some really good fight scenes, and especially if u are a die hard fan of the auto-bots,then you will get a really great feeling watching these scenes. I was totally hooked to this movie since the beginning. The only downside probably was that there was way to much content and time paid to many details was less. New Autobots did not get enough screen time. Older ones that did not make a return were missed. With that said I feel all in all this is a great movie.. Great entertainment value.

"tburke85","6","3","8","22 July 2009"," Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen Decent But With Many Flaws
","Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is decent but the film suffers from an overlong running time, a rushed finale, abrupt ending, and the lack of character development especially the Autobots and Decepticons. The dialogue wasn't the greatest at times and some of the humor didn't work either. Director Michael Bay is an okay director but this isn't his best film because there's more of everything (robots, action, special effects and humor) in this one but it ended up hurting this sequel instead of making it better. Shia Labeouf reprises the role of Sam providing his usual comic relief and he's decent as the character. Megan Fox is all right as Mikaela but she isn't given much to do except to be eye candy. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson are back too but even they seem to have less to do in this one. John Turturo is also back and he does a good job as Simmons . The special effects are top notch but it sort of becomes overkill after a while and the robot action/fight sequences are well executed for the most part. The only fight though that had any emotional to it was between Optimus and three Decepticons in a fierce forest showdown that leaves the Aubobots leader ready for the scrap yard because after that battle the action/fight sequences kind of become repetitive. This sequel definitely seemed to be more about the action and special effects than the story and characters. The biggest flaw this movie has is the treatment of not only the new autobots and decepticons but the returning ones as well because most of them with the exceptional of maybe Optimus, Bumblebee and Megatron don't get nearly enough screen time. Many of the new Decepticons introduced (like The Fallen, Devastator, Soundwave, Grindor, Sideways, and Demolisher among many others) only show up for a few minutes before either being killed or disappearing with no explanation. Except for Megatron, The Fallen, and Starscream the others have little to no dialogue who serve no real purpose besides one maybe two action/fight sequences. Some of the new Autbots including Arcee, Jolt, and Sideswipe aren't even given the proper treatment they deserve because none of them are in it long enough to leave an impression. Returning ones like Ironhide and Ratchet are MIA for the most of the movie. They both make a few appearances with little to no dialogue. They're not in it nearly as much as the first one. Even fan favorites like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee are MIA for large parts of the film but they're effective in their limited screen time. Megatron and Starscream get a little more to do than the first one by not by much. The two characters I was most disappointed in were The Fallen and Devastator. They both get at the most 5 to 8 minutes of screen time. The Fallen is an interesting character but he's killed off in his fight near the end by Optimus way too easily to be that much of a threat and he could've been a much more worthy adversary (His fight with Optimus lasts 8 to 10 seconds if that). The character Devastator had promise and looked like cool but the joke with the wrecking balls for his well you know I didn't find that funny. Devastator doesn't even show up until near the end and is easily defeated like The Fallen. Scorpnok makes a blink and you missed it cameo in the desert climax before being killed off five seconds later making the characters appearance rather pointless. There were simply too many robots on both sides. If they focused on the returning one mores and gave them more screen time while introducing some new robots it would've been better because some character development is better than none. The only two characters to get any sort of development were Jetfire and the Twins. I didn't find the Twins racist like some people did but the movie could've easily done without them giving more screen time to Optimus, Bumblebee, Ironhide, Ratchet, or some of the other characters. Jetfire was another interesting character but I don't know why they had him speak with an accent. The abrupt ending left you wondering about what happened to many of the characters like Megatron and Starscream to name a few. There was also a part late into the film where Sam gets hurt and then a second later his hand is bandaged up so this seemed like an error from the screenwriters for not coming up with a better way to put Labeouf's real life injury into the story. For those of you who have seen it already you probably know what scene I'm talking about. The ending does leaves the door open for another possible sequel but I just hope if they do make a third film it's better than this one. The music also didn't really seem to sync well with the movie like it did with the first one and the raunchy humor was often funny while others no so much. The running time of 2 and half hours did make the movie feel a little long especially toward the end. Overall despite it's many flaws Trasformers Revenge Of The Fallen is a decent sci-fi adventure with plenty of robot action, some humor, and good performances by the cast but this sequel could've been a lot better."

The movies borrow from both original ideas and cartoon/comic series'. If you research the Transformers Universe you'll see that both movies have deep plots for setup movies meaning that if you know about the transformers universe then you can tell that both of these movies are setting up the final conflict.

"addison-sp","9","3","8","30 June 2009"," Great Movie, Bad Movie-goers...
","This is probably the best Michael Bay Movie ever made. While that's not a great feat to accomplish, it can be mentioned that just a few short years ago he made Pearl Harbor, so he's definitely come a long way.<br/><br/>I am shocked, to say the least, with all the negative feedback that has come from so many people who've seen this movie. It F*ckin' rocked! It was everything you'd expect from a Michael Bay film and then some surprises. I find it baffling that so many people walked into the theater expecting anything more than a Michael Bay movie. There's a reason it's a summer blockbuster! It's supposed to be loud! It's supposed to have no plot! Did anyone watch Transformers from back in the day?: Lots of pretty lights, explosions, strung together by a micro- plot. Robots are supposed to be loud! They're freakin' robots! They're made of moving parts that clank and explosives that go boom.<br/><br/>There's a reason Good Will Hunting didn't have Transformers in it, and that's because you'd be dumb if you thought Transformers was anything other than loud explosions, lots of visual effects and modern slang to appeal to 13 year-old, ADHD-riddled boys - its target audience. If you can't appreciate this movie, then you obviously didn't like the original Transformers cartoon or the comics, and should therefore not watch a movie you won't like just so you can complain. Apparently many people forgot that Robots were loud and exploded when being hit with explosives (exploded from explosives being shot into their circuitry? who could've seen that coming?) and they needed Transformers to remind them that Robots don't sip tea and recite poetry. They are programmed to kick A$$. That's what they do. They don't need to be pretty about it.<br/><br/>It's a summer movie. It's about Robots with explosives. Quit acting like you are shocked and horrified to find out that a movie about robots fighting has... robots fighting in it. Grow up. Watch The English Patient if you want to watch a movie about Robots not Exploding, obviously that's what you meant to see in the first place if you came to a Michael Bay movie expecting to see a Orson Welles film.<br/><br/>(p.s.: Orson Welles was in Transformers back in '85 too. Apparently he understood that a good movie can also have explosions in it. What a crazy concept.)<br/><br/>Transformers 2 ruled. Quit being pretentious. The end."
"umbrellascientist","7","3","8","30 June 2009"," Average.
","The first fifty minutes of the movie is like... A drag. A really long, boring, painful and slow drag. The story was a bit confusing and kinda lame. Plus, too much robots looked the same to me. It was difficult to tell which was which, apart from the obvious ones.<br/><br/>Speaking of obvious... Too much obvious music playing in the back ground. Sad moment, sad music; Happy moment, happy music; Military deciding to go into battle against the Decepticons, military deciding to go into battle against the Decepticons music. It's like Bay was telling the audience what to feel, instead of letting the moment speak for itself. Really annoying.<br/><br/>The acting was average. For a comedy movie that is.<br/><br/>BUT, the last part of the movie, even if you don't get anything going on, don't like the acting, the music, etc., has some nice moments. dramatic and action-wise. So, instead of giving a 6 out of 10. I'll throw a 7. There are a few loose ends that the film never tie up, including the fate of some characters. That was disappointing also.<br/><br/>Nice to see with some friends, and have some laughs, either, with the movie, or of the movie. Other than that, avoid.<br/><br/>For me, Seven out of Ten."

","You know the boys who smash toy cars together and go ""bam!, crash!""? Now replace toy cars with real cars and real explosions. That's basically Transformers 2. Also, the cars punch each other in the face and shoot rockets.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 is a movie made by boys, made for boys. And as that, it's great fun. As an achievement in storytelling, you should rate it much, much lower. The script could have been written by a 9-year-old. What little there is to act as story makes little to no sense and sometimes comes out of nowhere. If Michael Bay wanted to create a cinematic masterpiece, he failed. What he did achieve though is a boy's dream of an action movie. <br/><br/>Go see it if you can ignore the plot and enjoy the action for its own sake, otherwise don't."

","If you value both your time and your money, don't see this movie. The people responsible for writing this thing must have just given up. The movie is chock full of crude attempts at forcing laughs out of the audience. I mean, there are two scenes of dogs humping at the start of the film and one scene of a robot humping Megan Fox's leg near the middle. Is the purpose to display continuity of theme or just because the writers ran out of ideas and were cutting and pasting jokes? The writers also chose to bless us with two stereotypically ghetto Autobots that are really more painful than amusing to watch. The special effects when the robots actually battle are the best part of the movie, but it seems that more often than not the fight scenes are between the military and the Decepticons, and it kind of gets old. The near death experience at the end is laughably bad. Stay away. Stay very far away."
"DrWurmjgo","7","3","8","24 June 2009"," Exciting Robot Fights; Could Do With Less Michael Bay.
","Well, I'm back. For sure, it was better than the first one, but I still can't stand Michael Bay's style. Mainly, his constant comic reliefs bug the hell out of me.<br/><br/>In this review, I vaguely talk about the plot of the movie. It's not in depth at all, but if you don't want to hear anything before you see it, don't read.<br/><br/>There's a bit of duality about my personality that conflicts me on this movie. On the one hand, I'm a techie electrical engineer (in training) who loves robots. Therefore, seeing big robots duke it out on screen is pretty enjoyable. On the other hand, there is the critical, contemplative side of me that enjoys movies with a lot of substance beyond explosions and mayhem. As such, I really enjoyed most of the fight scenes. However, the acting was all pretty much sub-par to par, and you never really get attached to any of the human characters. Optimus was probably the most emotionally convincing character in this movie, and he's completely CG! <br/><br/>One thing that really bugged me was the disposition of the decepticons. The decepticons' story doesn't really fit how they behave. They're searching for something all transformers need, but they're willing to destroy life while trying to get it. Does that make them bad? Sure. However, it seems to me that they wouldn't actively revel in the destruction of that life. To put it in D&D terms (LOL), the decepticons' story should make them neutral-evil, while they act like chaotic-evil.<br/><br/>Michael Bay likes to center his movies around a small group of protagonists against a large number of mostly faceless foes (except for 1 or 2 main bad guys). I think he chose the wrong group to center the movie around. Both transformers movies so far have pretty much revolved around Shia La Boeuf and his unarguably foxy companion Megan Fox (No surprise here that her first appearance on screen is more or less an upskirt shot). But this is Transformers! I don't care that this little dweeb is having girlfriend problems, I want to hear about the autobots and their problems. I'd like to see their characters developed more.<br/><br/>As for the rating, they crammed in about as much ""light"" profanity as they could, while keeping it PG-13 level. You won't see any body parts flying around (aside from those of nonorganics), despite the explosions they so frequently stand on top of. I would've preferred a darker, more gritty rated R version, but I'm sure that wouldn't be nearly as profitable.<br/><br/>As for the IMAX quality, before the movie was shot, an announcer came on and described the difference between the IMAX and 35mm versions. For most of the movie, the original aspect ratio (16:9 or something) is displayed (just much bigger than a regular theater). However, for certain scenes, the movie was shot with IMAX film, and IMAX viewers get to see some content that was not in the 35mm version. In these scenes, the entire IMAX screen was filled. I tried to notice when this happened, but I only caught 2 scenes. First was when optimus is fighting the decepticons in the woods. Second is the scene that really SUCKED (lots of SUCKING). If you've seen the movie, you should know which one I'm talking about.<br/><br/>As I see it, there are 2 kinds of people in this world. There is the critical minority, which I belong to. Then there is the more receptive general public. 95% of the time, movies are made for the general public. Every now and then, a movie (such as The Dark Knight) comes along that can satisfy both parties. I would say that this movie is not quite one of them. It could have been, had Michael Bay not directed it. (On that note, 100% of Michael Bay's movies are made for the general public) For the TLDRers out there, I give this movie a 7.4/10.<br/><br/>Jason"

I struggle to understand how critics think sometimes and what they truly expect out of a film like this. Are they expecting Oscar winning performances from robots?? A twist that disguises the fact that the good robots are trying to save the world from bad robots? Perhaps Megatron could secretly have been Optimus Primes father all along?? To be quite blunt, the background of the transformers story is good robots saving the human race....... and that is exactly what the film is about!! Anyone going to watch this film should go with the mindset that there are gong to be a huge amount of mechanical objects transforming into robots and fighting and trust me, there is no shortage of that. The special effects are mind blowing, the acting was good and suitable for the film and the plot and story?? as expected for a fictional story about robots Yes there are a few areas that the film could do without such as the childish 'hip' robot twins who are somewhat annoying and yes, the film has been criticised as being immature in places BUT... it is about a cartoon! I loved the cartoon as all children probably did but do remember that I am 20 years older now and shouldn't be looking for the film to appeal to me as an adult.

The parts that were edited should have remained and a lot of the parts that were in the movie were not needed...I got tired of seeing Ms. Tennessee Megan Fox puff up her lips and do all the things she thinks the guys are looking for in this movie, its called ""suggestive direction"". Any way I did remember that Shia hurt his hand while making the movie and miraculously I found Waldo from one scene with a good hand to the next scene a bandaged hand, talk about continuity!

As far as story goes, there is one. Why people seem to think there isn't is beyond me. As i said, its the typical morons who think every film has to have a ridiculously in depth story and character development.

"Nezz","8","3","8","28 June 2009"," Messy storyline but I didn't care.
","I enjoyed myself! The storytelling was a bit messy and there were a few plot holes but I didn't care much. It bothered me to an extent but not enough to ruin the experience for me. This movie wasn't trying to achieve anything great, it's not vying for any academy awards, it's just there to give people a good time at the movies. For me, it did just that. It pleased most of the people in the theater I was in.<br/><br/>If we're going to be real, okay (spoiler alert): the movie was TOO long. They dragged that dessert scene for ages, which they didn't need to because the story is formulaic, we know Optimas Prime is going to be resurrected and he's going to kick ass, so dragging it on just made everything a bit too melodramatic. The storyline was sloppy--it had a lot of potential but they tried to complicate things, there was a lot of disorganization, rushing through the actual meat of the story. It confused me. That was the beauty of the first movie. They kept it simple and concise and it worked out because they let the characters and the action do the work. We didn't have to try to figure what was going on while we watched cars and robots crash into each other (deciphering plots is difficult to do when there's so much sensory overload). And I have to agree, although the special effects were incredible, I often found myself questioning whether that was an Autobot I was seeing or a Decepticon. It didn't help that they merged Optimas Prime and a Decepticon (although that was VERY cool). The characters seemed more 2D than usual, but it didn't bother me.<br/><br/>All that aside, I still really liked the movie (the first was way better though). I liked what they did bring to the table, the material was good enough (the ending fell a little short, but I was sort of expecting that). I loved the humor in it, it was so alpha and beta male style--I can see how some people might be turned off by that, but come on. They're trying to please a demographic here (cars+robots+hot girls... gotta have that kind of humor interplay). Bumblebee was awesome. I wasn't expecting Isabelle, but sure, I'll buy it.<br/><br/>If this kind of movie reaches out to you, you'll probably have a good time. I think you kind of have to be into the alien robots, cars, that macho-guy sense of humor, massive action scenes or at least be open to it to like the film. By the way, Optimas Prime stole the show every time he came out. He has the best entrances ever.<br/><br/>8/10."

Sorry Watchmen, you've been usurped.<br/><br/>First, let's start out with the general idea.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen takes place two years after the first movie left off. Both the Autobots and Decepticons have been in a stalemate, while Optimus Prime and the Autobots have teamed up with a new, elite military unit that specializes in fighting the Decepticons, known simply as NEST. After discovering a Decepticon in Shanghai, wrecking most of the city in the process of fighting the Decepticon, the Autobots receive a warning that an ancient being known as The Fallen will have his revenge. After touching a sliver of the All-Spark that was caught in his hooded sweatshirt, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) starts seeing images in his head of the Fallen and starts drawing strange Cybertroinan symbols. While this is happening, the United States government wants to force the Autobots to leave, believing it to be the only way to stop the Autobot-Decepticon skirmishes from destroying all the major cities on Earth. Sam Witwicky, now a college student, is asked by Optimus to be a sort of peace ambassador for the Autobots to convince the government to let them stay on Earth, but Sam says no. Then everything stars to go really bad when the Decepticons steal a fragment of the Allspark from a Naval base and use it to revive the dead Megatron.<br/><br/>The Good After seeing Transformers 1, I was actually wondering how they were going to top it, but they did. This has got to be some of the best action scenes that I have seen in years, even better than the action scenes in The Dark Knight. ILM has really outdone themselves, after seeing the effects they did in the first one, Iron Man, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. You had some entertaining new characters (Mudflap and Skids, also known as The Twins, and they are not racist at all, and they are not the new Jar-Jar Binks like some people say. The humor was very funny, and everyone, in all three times I was a the theater, laughed at every single joke in the movie. And the IMAX experience is just great.<br/><br/>The Bad I don't really have anything bad to say about this one, except for the fact that it was kind of a little long, and could have been cut down a little bit. The Deceptions and The Fallen's plans to destroy Earth was kind of stupid, and I wished that Soundwave, my favorite Decepticon, could have had a few fight scenes himself instead of just floating around in space the whole time. Hopefully, he'll be in Transformers 3 and he'll actually have fight scenes this time.<br/><br/>Overall The general consensus is this. If you hated the first one, then don't see this one, it won't change your opinion, but if you loved this one, then this is a must-see. If you loved the first one, then by all means, ignore the bad reviews, and go out and have a good time. And now, I wait patiently for July 4, 2012 for the third one."
"mert_jason","7","3","8","27 June 2009"," What were you expecting for?!?!
","OK,Michael Bay may be one of the biggest and greatest directors of our time or you can think that the first transformers was better;but actually what were you expecting for really?You may tell that this movie is a mess of special effects;but this is the reason why it's made.And i must admit that they were all good.The only thing which made me bored was the last fight scene.It was tooo long.After years you will probably only remember Megan Fox in this real summer blockbuster.And i realised that Shia LaBeouf's character Sam was no longer important at the end of the story.That was a tragic loss for a good script.Don't expect too much,don't think too much.Just watch it like you watched the first one and probably will watch the third repeat of this installment..."
"lukasmacmillan","6","3","8","25 June 2009"," Why all the Negativity?
","First off i wanna ask why a lot of people hated this movie. I mean you think with a name like transformers revenge of the fallen that your going to get the shawshank redemption? No of course its going to be cheesy. Some people need to let up on this site and stop nit picking the **** out of every film they see. Enjoy it for what it is. <br/><br/>Anyways this movie is freaking amazing. The special effects, the adventure, the war scenes. They were all done perfect, and props to Michael Bay too bad he has to deal with people who don't know a good movie when they see one. <br/><br/>Positives: 1. The Action was incredible, major improvement from the first film. 2. Megan Fox..... 3. This movie had more of adventure theme in it, it's hard to say how without spoilers but, trust me its cool. 4. More Transforms and more actions scenes in different settings. It was a treat for the eyes. <br/><br/>Negative: 1. WAY to long 2. It should have focused on the original autobots from the first film but it was focusing on two new robots 3. Not enough megan fox aha :P <br/><br/>All in all its a great film. The movie to see this summer. Normally i would give it a 7 or an 8 but al the negativity caused me to give it a higher rating. <br/><br/>Respect it for what it is. A cartoon show made into a movie isn't goign to be a masterpiece idiots..."

"nikjoshi","7","3","8","25 June 2009"," Cool movie - but slightly overdone
","So I watched the last show (11.30pm) on the first day in IMAX... the show was apparently sold out, but the usher allowed me anyways on a regular ticket - and I found a great seat at the back! So far so good... Lets get the good things out there... Great scenes - right from the urban fight scenes to the scenes over the pyramids! Great animation and transformation sequences. Shia LaBeouf looks very convincing as a college freshman, Bumble bee was at his best with his radio vocabulary. Bad things - so what was great as one or two scenes (street fights, transformations, freaky creatures), there were 50 of them in the movie... Megan Fox - supposedly the sexiest female on earth - shows up in every other shot with her glossed lips, brushed cheeks, mascara-ed eyelids and the permanent pout... great eye candy, but kinda gets in the way of most of the action. Michael Bay used her the best in the first movie, where she actually had a lot of action, but in this one, all she does is to run behind Shia, scream, ""bounce"", and tame a midget Decepticon! All in all, I want to love the movie - because I am such an unabashed fan... but the movie is overdone - with special effects - both transformers and sexy babes..."
"smlubecki","7","3","8","24 June 2009"," An Amazing EYE POPPING spectacle
","I just got back from seeing Revenge of the Fallen. It was nowhere as BAD as the negative reviews have portrayed it.<br/><br/>This movie was great fun. I took my daughter to see it because she loved the first movie and she thought it was awesome. Did it have its faults? Sure it did but first and foremost this is a movie about giant alien robots that transform into planes, cars and a variety of other items. To expect anything other than pure escapism is to delude oneself.<br/><br/>The action sequences were very intense and the fight sequence in the forest is by far the most amazing thing put on film. My only major beef with the film was the sometimes inappropriate interjection of needless sexual references. <br/><br/>The Autobot twins were hysterical and nowhere near the level of Jar Jar annoyance that some have claimed. This movie also showed how bad ass Bumblebee can actually be. My only other complaint is they included many new Autobots into the mix but overall screen time was lacking. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next sequel. Definitely one to see on the big screen."
"jsdsjd","7","3","8","24 June 2009"," Good movie but could have left out the sexual parts for the kids.
","As a whole I thought the movie was good. It was as to be expected for a summer blockbuster. The only complaint I had was the sexual material that was used and I watched three different sets of parents leave with their small children. Parents use extreme caution with any children under 1o years old. The sad thing is that the scenes were pointless and did not add or would not have taken away from the movie, so why were they added? Transformers at the heart is for the kids. The director should have taken that into account before adding those scenes.<br/><br/>Visually I thought the movie was great. Like most sequels it lacks a good story line but they try to make up for it by adding more explosions and fighting. If your looking for a movie with lots of action then you'll like this movie. Just remember to leave the kids at home for this one."
"MaximumMadness","3","3","8","24 June 2009"," ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a solid sequel. Inferior in terms of story and acting, but vastly superior in terms of action. Worth seeing on the big screen...
","Director Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" was a summer-surprise in 2007, and certainly left me in awe. It had everything you could want in a special-effects-spectacle and was definitely more than what meets the eye- it head a big heart at its core.<br/><br/>Now, in 2009, a year that has seen some great hits, and some only-decent hits, we get the follow-up, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen."" And while this is technically the second ""Transformers"" film, they could have just called it ""Transformers 1.5"", because for the most part, it really just feels like more of the same. But that isn't a bad thing necessarily.<br/><br/>At the start of the film, we learn that Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the rest of the Autobots (""good-guy Transformers"") have joined forces with the US government- their goal: to hunt down the remaining Decepticons (""bad-guy Transformers"") who are threatening the human populous.<br/><br/>At the same time, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is heading off to college, but chooses to leave his Autobot companion Bumblebee behind, much to his disappointment. He is also setting up a long-distance relationship with his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox, sexy, 'nuff said). However, while packing, he finds a tiny fragment of the destroyed AllSpark device from the first film that splintered into his clothes, and upon coming into contact with it, strange symbols of an ancient language of Cybertron (Transformers' home-world) are imprinted in his mind.<br/><br/>Soon, the only other remaining piece of the AllSpark is stolen by Decepticons and used to resurrect their leader Megatron (Hugo Weaving), who immediately begins plotting with HIS master, an ancient Transformer called ""The Fallen."" The Fallen wants to track down an ancient doomsday device located on Earth, and use it to destroy the planet in a plot to harvest ""Energon"", the life-force that powers the Transformers, in order to allow for the birth of new Decepticons! <br/><br/>And so, a game of cat-and-mouse begins, as the Decepticons track Sam, whose visions from the AllSpark hold a key piece of the puzzle to their plot, while the Autobots must protect him, as he tries to thwart the Decepticons.<br/><br/>That's basically it. There are a few other details he and there, and a few subplots (such as Sam going to college, only to bring much destruction and chaos), but they really aren't all to important. This is a movie about robots socking each other, and cool looking backdrops getting blown to smithereens, and on that level, this movie delivers.<br/><br/>I will say this, Michael Bay knows how to make an entertaining action flick. His direction is kinetic but coherent, unlike other modern action which can sometimes be so kinetic, you lose track of what's going on. I actually experienced that problem with the original film, but this time around, I was able to fully understand everything I saw. I was also more easily able to differentiate between the Autobots and Decepticons, which was almost impossible during the final forty minutes of movie one, thus making the action much more enjoyable this time around.<br/><br/>Also, on the robot CG, overall, the photo-realism of the robots hasn't really improved, they appear about the same as the first film, which was fantastic, so I can easily forgive they they don't look dramatically better. But there was a huge advancement on SCALE, which is where a lot of research and development appears to have gone. When a Decepticon known as ""Devastator"" Transforms, you'll know what I mean.<br/><br/>On the acting... Well, the voice acting (Particularly Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving) was excellent. The human acting... Mixed for the leads. LaBeouf does an OK job, but Fox really just comes off as the ""hot chick who kicks butt"", and her character-type has been played a lot better many times before. Some other returning characters (Ex. Major William Lennox, played by Josh Duhamel) are only OK, whereas others (Ex. John Turturro as Simmons) are a lot of fun to watch. Also a blast are Sam's parents (Kevin Dunn and Julie White), returning with a larger role this time.<br/><br/>Another thing to watch for in this entry is the multitude of new Transformers, Autobot and Decepticon alike. Overall, they are a mixed bag. We never really get to meet the new bots, they are just there, but after a while you get used to them. Some are very cool (the three Arcee bikes give a nice, unique scale, and JetFire is just awesome), while others are downright irritating. (most heinous offenders being the Twins Mudflap and Skids, who despite having an adorably cute design, just have comedy that falls flat as a pancake.) <br/><br/>Also, I take issue with the lack of character development. Bumblebee was a joy to watch in the first film, and had great interaction with Sam, but this time, there are only a few scenes of them directly interacting as friends. Also, the romantic element between Sam and Mikaela is watered down slightly, because it has already been established and is now just a plot device to get you to like the characters.<br/><br/>I guess in the end, it boils down to this- this is a sequel inferior in terms of plot and character development, but vastly superior in terms of action and visual effects. And this is meant to be a big, loud, fun movie, so that uneven balance works.<br/><br/>While not quite as good as the original, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" still works, and is definitely worth seeing on the big screen. If you can honestly say you watched this film without being thrilled during the action, or very amused by the humor, then you need to lighten up. A decent 6.5 out of 10 (I have to round up to ""7"" for IMDb) from me- enjoyable. See it with some friends and a LOT of popcorn."
"mattdonns_999","8","3","8","23 June 2009"," good...but felt weird
","I think the hype for tf2 was wayyyy too high and Micheal bay knew he had to pull something outta the bag to beat the first..unfortunately i don't think he did in terms of connecting with the movie.<br/><br/>the action throughout was amazing - forest fight, final fight. And agent Simmons had a more prominent role which worked well.<br/><br/>However it feels almost too cheesy at parts, like optimus saying ''i'll take you all on'' it doesn't seem like his character and you felt disconnected from all the autobots as they had less of a speaking role. Also there were far tooo many decepticons, there was too much to look at in certain scenes.<br/><br/>If MB does a third transformers he's gonna need a reality check and think about what the fans really want. however don't knock this film it was still very enjoyable despite the ridiculously long run time."

Only reason i think some people didn't like it is because they built up so much hype that when they saw the movie and it didn't meet their expectations they were bummed out. Overall great movie.

"rmwaters3000","9","3","8","23 June 2009"," Don't believe the dis-hype
","I felt compelled to write a review of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen after seeing the kinds of beatings the critics have been giving it. I don't pretend to know everything, but I know a bit about films. I like 'intelligent' films like Pi, but know there has to be a flip side to cinema. I went in to this film with low expectations, but was well aware it wasn't supposed to be The Wrestler or Frost/Nixon.<br/><br/>OK, let's be brief and frank and admit the first Transformers wasn't spectacular, but no one ever expected it to be. It seems to have done its job and made people happy. However, its sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, seems to be taking a beating.<br/><br/>The film's plot in a nutshell follows Sam into college as he experiences hallucinations caused by a shard of the cube from the first film. Meanwhile, the Autobots have been working with a newly formed soldier group that are trying to get rid of the Decepticons from the planet. The main focus of the story is the Decepticons attempts to return to power and Sam and the Autobots attempts to stop that.<br/><br/>Now, no one goes to these kind of films expecting Schindler's List. They are what they are; simple, good fun. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen succeeds in this area. It's more action packed, more amusing, better effects, better acting, and generally more fulfilling than the original. The main drawbacks to it would be its length, which you will definitely feel in the last act, and some of the humour being a bit too slapstick (the mum in the college, some of the Autobots interact with each other), but even with this, it can still be enjoyable (particularly with a good audience!).<br/><br/>Imagine a film like Armageddon, a film you like, even though it might shame you slightly. You know how a lot of it is going to turn out, you know a lot of it is unbelievable, but that's popcorn for you. Let's remember that Michael Bay has pretty much defined action films. He brings a slickness and immediacy that would be otherwise missing. Sure, there could be more depth to the characters or more meaning given to a lot of things, but who goes to a film filled with giant robots for that? Ignore the critics (seems they're more focused on tearing films down and seeming sophisticated anyway). This film isn't going to change lives, but there's certainly worse ways to spend 160 minutes of your life. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is exactly what it is meant to be; entertaining."

","This film was a bit slow at the start but after the first half hour, it got into its rhythm of adrenaline charged action and a lot of adult humour which didn't stop until the end titles come up.<br/><br/>I don't know how people could say it was crap and boring because it was just non stop noise and action.<br/><br/>1 person said he wanted robots beating the crap out of each over and he said it didn't live up 2 his expectations, thats a load of crap because it was non stop robots fighting against each over for the whole movie. <br/><br/>I thought it wasn't going 2 be as good as the first 1 but i thought it was better than the first 1 with a lot more action in it, and it started of going straight into the action of the film. THIS IS THE BEST FILM I'VE EVER SEEN!"
"j-m-fustin-2","8","3","8","22 June 2009"," If you have forgotten what it felt like to be a kid, go and criticize something else.
","Food critics judging the best and most expensive gastronomic restaurants in the world will not go to the local fish and chips or burger place and afterward write an angry diatribe on how unexpectedly crappy and unfathomably cheap and disgusting it all was.<br/><br/>Most of us the plebe, who are not paid to criticize the work of others, will still eat every now and then these wonderfully unhealthy burgers and have a great time. It is fatty, may not be animal friendly, may not be good for the planet and does not contain foie gras, caviar or saffron. Yet, we eat one with pleasure! <br/><br/>This is I feel a good analogy with this film and the reception ""licenced"" critics, and even some free-lance ones, gave to it. It is not Kubrik, Cohen, Lee, Hitchcock, Wenders, Kurosawa. It is not about a man who wasn't there, not about two gay cowboys horse-riding in picturesque mountains and not about the changing morality of a rich physician.<br/><br/>It is made by Michael Bay, and it is about Transformers. Great! Pearl Harbour was a serious theme, too serious for Micheal Bay. Transformers is just what he needs. I do not say Bay is a poor Director. Give ""Tranformers"" to Clint Eastwood...oh God have Mercy.<br/><br/>Seriously, what did you expect? Optimus Prime, prostrated on the All Spark, staring with a troubled metallic frown at an exhaust, asking ""to be or not to be""?<br/><br/>I am not a teenage boy. I am a 32 years old scientist with a taste for varied entertainment. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. There are holes in it, it would be better with a tight plot, but so what? The very nature of Transformers does not make sense anyway.<br/><br/>Actors did their part too. Acting was fine, perhaps not perfect. Just remember, they are asked to act in front of a big empty space, or maybe a cardboard face of a robot suspended ten feet in the air, later replaced by CGI entities beating the crap our of each others. Who could do as well as they do, I wonder. I'll give them excuses for their lack of perfection. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox, together with John Turturro and the rest of the cast, build a good and believable cast.<br/><br/>The audience this movie targets is quite difficult to define. At times I thought the humour was a little bit too Disney-ish, which targets obviously little kids, but the next moment the wonderfully under-dressed backside of either Megan Fox or Isabel Lucas zoomed on the screen. It was very nice, but I do not think I would have been pleased to bring a kid to see this. I hope Michael Bay will decide for whom Transformers is next time.<br/><br/>My mark is 8/10. I would have removed about 10 minutes from the final battle. Would have liked more substance to less robots. Less plot holes. Less silly cartoon comedy. REMOVE the annoying twin robots, they make it hard to take Optimus Prime and the Autobots seriously. Finally, Hasbro should let Michael Bay a bit more freedom: it is product placement at its worse. That being said, we are not forced to buy any toys, are we? I bought my last transformers 10 years ago...yes, I know, I was 22, but the alternate form was a great red ant. I could not resist. Besides, the new toys do not make justice to the robots in the film!"
"davggsco","7","3","8","21 June 2009"," Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen - A Wavy Davy Review
","Ridiculous! What an absolutely ridiculous movie! I still cannot decide whether I detest or love this movie and the swirl of robot carnage which Michael Bay delivers slickly. I have plumped for a diplomatic seven as it neither deserves full praise, no film by Michael Bay does, yet I came out with my adolescent male blood pumping to Linkin Park's great new song. <br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is trying to forget about the events of the first film, and even leaves his loyal friend Bumblebee, parents and girlfriend (Megan Fox) to go to college. (Once again Fox displays a lack of acting ability, but I think we will forgive her for that). Sam discovers a remaining piece of the Allspark, which imprints a map onto his mind (seriously!) to a device which can destroy our Sun. With the resurrection of Megatron, and the return of his scheming master The Fallen, Sam is suddenly in high demand, with everyone wanting his mind. Sam goes globetrotting with a century old Deception, his sleazy college room-mate (they never seem to ask him what he is doing with them!), and other friends from the last movie. To make things worse, Sam's ever embarrassing parents are captured by the Decepticons (a very strange, and seemingly unnecessary sub-plot). This messy storyline turns into a mission to save the Earth, so Sam must save the day.<br/><br/>Does that seem a lot of information for a Michael Bay film? Well, that is because it is a lot. It is too long at two and a half hours, something I noticed clearly with the high proportion of people needing to nip out to the toilet. There is a fabulous scene in forestry where Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) fights off multiple Decepticons, which could probably have served as the end of the movie. Instead, it is dragged out for another hour or so, leaving the audience a bit tired and, I have to say, the excitement of seeing crazily complicated fights between robots has waned. There is also a distinct feeling that Bay simply has a craving for Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson walking in slow motion, as except for these cool shots there was no other reason for them in this film. Ultimately, what can a sharp shooting soldier really do against killer machines that turn into very cool cars? We even get a strange few lines from an English soldier whose accent is as strong as the robots themselves. <br/><br/>There is not a similar feeling of worthlessness to John Turturro's return as Agent Simmons, now living at a deli with his mother. Turturro actually rescues the film when interest begins to fade, and lifts it to the climax at the end.<br/><br/>Despite Turturro's injection of humour and interest, Revenge of the Fallen cannot hide from the fact that it has a very, very similar plot to that of the first movie. Both end up with similar scenes, Sam running to stop the Decepticons from using a machine (the Allspark before, and now the Matrix) to destroy the world. Part of the reason these films are just SO insanely stupid is the fact that the villains are too one dimensional, with seemingly very little reason to destroy the earth other than their hatred of the Autobots (does that make sense?). <br/><br/>Some may say this film was just too ridiculous. I thought that for a while. But then I thought, is it any more ridiculous than a small man with hairy feet trying to destroy a ring, or Bruce Willis saving the world from an asteroid? Transformers 2 has some comic moments, some exciting moments and even some sad moments, but not enough of these pockets of quality to fill the two and a half hour run-time. It is a fun action romp, but be prepared! For full enjoyment be willing to turn off all, and I mean ALL ounce of common sense!<br/><br/>7/10"
"charliegeeza","5","3","8","20 June 2009"," Special Effects + Mediocre Movie
","I went in expecting this to be awful. The first transformers was total tripe, a special effects orgy with an underlying movie so thin and poorly scripted that I felt somewhat conned and underwhelmed by the whole experience.<br/><br/>In this regard, Transformers 2 is a big improvement. The number of human characters gets reduced, there is far more meaningful dialogue. The robots, as with the first, looked great. The humour was much better, although still too many overly idiotic scenes. The human character development was a marked improvement.<br/><br/>It does fall short in many areas. Several scenes look impossible (think big robots superimposed onto rooms / roads / scenery that they are too big for), the CGI often doesn't blend totally with the real scene (giant robots walking on sand do not leave footprints and a sand sucking robot sucks up imaginary sand whilst you see the actual scene unaffected underneath the digital sand, and many more examples).<br/><br/>Where Michael Bay really fails is in tying together humans and robots in death defying action. The worst point is when we are expected to believe that our intrepid antagonist Sam (Shia Le Bouef) can run a mile with his girlfriend Michaela(Megan Fox) in tow in the midst of a giant battle. Apparently the Decepticons can't run much faster than their human foes, nor aim their guns at them. It was all a little unbelievable and you would have hoped that a better story writer would have come up with a more plausible way (and there were many) for the plot to unfold.<br/><br/>Add to that some incredibly corny moments, and some terrible ideas like humping transformers, terminator-3-like transformers, and generally the movie flowing simply from one special effect to another, and it's just hard to actually get drawn in and take the movie seriously.<br/><br/>Don't take this movie seriously and you'll enjoy it. Expect any depth and you'll simply hit the bottom almost straight away."
"palegreysky-2","8","3","8","20 June 2009"," Frickin' awesome!
","I've been waiting two years for this film and I was not disappointed. Giant robots, explosions and Megan Fox - what more do you really need in a film?!<br/><br/>Yes, the acting isn't superb and the plot/storyline is a bit dodgy, but then as said already: it's a summer blockbuster based on a toy line that is out to entertain. And entertain me it did!<br/><br/>The action sequences are awesome- crazy fight scenes with robots blasting away at each other and smacking each other around with crazy transformer kungfu. Optimus Prime fighting off Megatron, Starscream and the drone was a truly superb fight scene. People have complained about not being able to see all the action or tell which robot is which- personally I had no problem at all keeping up with the fighting and who was currently getting an ion cannon to the face.<br/><br/>I loved the fact that Soundwave (with original G1 voice!), Ravage, Sideswipe, Wheelie, Arcee and Devastator were included in the film. I especially like Ravage with his mounted cannons/missile launchers, just like his G1 counterpart. The inclusion of Alice as a Decepticon Pretender was great also (sandipbharj's earlier review didn't understand it's inclusion and said it doesn't fit the TF world: Pretenders with human exteriors are very much a part of TF!)<br/><br/>The Matrix of Leadership makes an appearance as a kind of Matrix/Key to Vector Sigma way: also very nice. I love all these G1 throwbacks like the Earlier Primes and Sam being able to talk to them through the Matrix. Megan Fox looks as great as ever- yes she isn't going to be winning any Oscars for her performance, but she does what is required of her well. Shia is on form- he makes me chuckle and is good as an action hero.<br/><br/>But, there is of course some bad aspects of the film. Mudflap and Skids, the twin autobots, were goofy looking and a detriment to the film. Transformers needs a bit of humour and generally the funny bits were done well- but the twins were shockingly grating in a Jar-jar Binks way. With a few less jokes, sensible voices and faces that didn't look like disneyfied goblins they would have been fine. Bay should have included Sunstreaker as Sideswipe's twin instead...<br/><br/>Jetfire was a shock. I knew he was appearing in the film and was looking forward to seeing him. He was just embarrassing though. Played in an old-codger, bumbling idiot style really destroyed his old G1 character. When he appears to fight at the end and destroys Scorponok there was a real ""yeah!"" feeling. His character during the final fight was great: old and battered but still fighting and happy to sacrifice his spark and parts for Optimus. They end up combining (kinda) in a reference to the Armada series.<br/><br/>With the all action start and the crazily destructive final battle, it was a bit disappointing that the film slowed down a bit in the middle. There just seemed to be some unnecessary ""plot"" development and talking parts (with some more dodgy humour) that just weren't needed. The film could have been shortened by 20-30 minutes or more combat could have been added in to fill that time.<br/><br/>My only other gripe is the backseat that some of the Autobots were relegated to. Very little is seen of Arcee, Ratchet, Jolt or Sideswipe. They're all about shooting stuff and fighting but they seem to have little use towards the end of the film. Ironhide is kept involved through the film- maybe he proved very popular in the first Transformers- still would have preferred to see more of Sideswipe/Arcee.<br/><br/>So essentially; if you love the Transformers franchise and the first film, appreciate CGI and watching giant robots smash the crap out of each other, or can't get enough of Miss Fox, then you will love this film. Please just go in and watch with a truly suspended disbelief and not expecting A* acting/plot, and enjoy the film. You won't be disappointed."
"sixxgod","2","3","8","20 June 2009"," A Great movie that falls just short of fantastic
","I, like many others loved the first movie and went to see this one with high expectations. Only now I am thinking I set them too high, its just that there were a few things that annoyed me. <br/><br/>1. The comedy in the first one was real, subtle and clever, this movie still retains some of that but ruins it by making it silly. The mum getting stoned started off as a funny little joke but took it too far; getting robots to swear is not big or clever i didn't see the point in it these are supposed to be advanced beings and the twins grated on me they had no point other then to be funny (although the ass kicking line at the start made me laugh).<br/><br/>2. The transformer that changed into a human was a stupid idea, it ruined the point of the transformers, huge robots that changed into vehicles is cool.<br/><br/>3. The effects were fantastic but sometimes i felt The Transformers looked a little cartoony.<br/><br/>4. Far too many lines like ""I will have my revenge"" and ""It is your destiny"" <br/><br/>5. The dream sequence was plain silly, i know that a load of transforming robots is hardly realistic, but, the first film was fantasy set in a real world and so this one was too until this bit.<br/><br/>6. Too many nameless and faceless Transformers. The first film you knew who they were and you were with them all the way, when one died you felt sad. In this movie when one died you didn't care because you didn't know them. I also felt we weren't given a chance to reconnect with them making one scene in particular annoying because I wanted to be sad but wasn't. Also making Megatron and Starsceen snivelling idiots was also annoying All this aside the film is great its a great film for the summer and I will be getting it on DVD if it wasn't for these few niggles it would be a true classic but it falls just short."
"Quinoa1984","1","13","58","24 October 2009"," Blockbuster Vomit of a sickening variety
","Think about this: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen cost hundreds of millions to produce, making back its money and then some. In box-office terms it's the success of the year, reaching 400 million domestically and cracking the top ten highest grossing movies ever. It would appear shallow to consider numbers, but I doubt that Michael Bay or the producers or studio chiefs would mind. At the end of the day, whatever the f*** is up on the screen is probably moot compared to the vast amounts of the almighty dollar made at the expense of a product that can be whatever it wants to be. In this case, what it is is a fiasco of incredible proportions. There's barely a moment I cared about what was going on, who was who, what was fighting what, where the sun (yes, the sun) fit into all of the ballyhoo going on, and frankly, I'm not sure if Bay did entirely either. It's what the ""worst-movie-of-the-decade"" title is all about.<br/><br/>Oh, I'm sure Bay thought he was making a good movie, probably a HELLA-GOOD movie by the look of things, as he always does. He has a frenetic eye that has, for better or worse, given him the clout to go wherever and do whatever he wants in his films. But for Revenge of the Fallen he goes further with the stakes of incoherent storytelling/film-making and wasted characters and (some) wasted potential. It's hard, or just not really necessary, to talk about the plot of the film, except that a piece of the Aulspark (sic) is at stake in bringing an enemy force of Decepticons to fight Autobots and the Fallen, a real baddie alien-robot, is out to destroy the world and maybe use the sun for something. How did I come to this conclusion after watching the movie? I looked it up online. That's how bad it is to figure out.<br/><br/>But what wasted potential, you might ask? Well, doesn't giant robot battles fused with a plot to use the sun to destroy everything sound like a kick-ass escapist flick? Oh boy, not in Michael Bay's hands it is not. And let's not forget it's not all on him either - the writers, who just this past summer also scribed the new Star Trek picture (perhaps a sign of how crucial a director is in the process of film-making on a massive scale), throw cliché-feces at the audience in a mind-numbing two and a half hours. It's actually an endurance test just to pick out all of the crappy things about the movie, and it all build up, sometimes at astronomical rates. And it's not just Skids and Mudflap being *stoopid* (not racist caricatures so much as part of the cultural f***-all psychology omnipresent), and not just the rampant ludicrous spirit that has no soul or inspiration to it (save, perhaps, for Rainn Wilson as a professor).<br/><br/>No, it's just... EVERYTHING! This is a movie where, despite all of the hard work put in by the crew and all of the hours put in and high-flying action scenes choreographed, its makers seem to have something against its own audience. Everything is amped to 11 - bad sex jokes, bad drug jokes, horrible 'inspirational' dialog scenes, and awful ""new"" ideas such as Robot Heaven and robot balls - and all put to Bay's trademark camera-work and editing style, propelling a viewer into scenes that have no proper flow or reasoning, and action that cuts away too fast to get engaged or for us to have reason to invest ourselves in the characters fighting.<br/><br/>Even simple things like TIME and PLACE are shot to hell. Take for example two transitions, where our daring-do heroes (i.e. LaBeouf, Fox, Tuturro, Skids/Mudflap, etc) come upon the Smithsonian museum to find some old first-gen Decepticon that's really a jet. They find it and a scene (sort of) happens, then they walk outside and it's... not Washington DC, or is it, since there's a long field and planes. Then, a teleportation happens sending all of the characters to Egypt. Fine, one supposes, until one realizes this is in present time, and day is still day halfway across the world! <br/><br/>It would seem one would try to think things through as simple as the logical geography of where the characters are, or the logic of how fast they might travel (Mikaela going from LA to New York in ten seconds, not just movie time), or about what sense there is in the who's who in the robot battles. But there's very little thought put into logic, because Bay has little interest. One almost has to admire how dumb, loud, annoying, idiotic and poorly (or barely present) acted is all turns out to be, like a burrito in a blender spun to a speed of super-volcano-nausea of all of the clichés and formulas of action spectacles that Bay can think of or just pull out of his ass. One may have a few laughs at some of the things in the film, but if it it is never intentional or pleasant... that is, depending on the viewer. One also has to remember how BIG an audience the film had, and how it did, if only in theory, obtain repeat business. It may also sell quite well on DVD.<br/><br/>But there is a fact that should be acknowledged: no matter who wins in Transformers, we lose, even if people don't realize or want to fess up. The first film was, as I recall thinking, not a horror-show but just a soulless marketing grab-bag for the line of toys. This time is different. Bay goes past the likes of Armageddon and Bad Boys II. He's entered a league of his own in the I-don't-give-a-crap strata of cinema auteurs. It's a mind-boggling vad of cine-vomit you can take or leave. I'd be surprised to meet the one who takes-takes-takes. For realz."
"fatlucky","4","5","17","19 June 2009"," Senseless Dizzying Action
","After the huge hype generated by the media, mostly due to Megan Fox, this film ceases to fulfil the expectations of most viewers. The audience left the cinema murmuring about what actually happened and the different ways it should have ended. It was surprisingly anti-climatic, especially after the huge build up during the film. It is filled with senseless dizzying action, that were very hard to follow due to the fact that it was transformers fighting, so the clash of mechanical imagery was confusing at best. The film was flooded with a downpour of debris, bombs and random bits of robots flying all over the place. Spectacular action but it does get tiresome, especially in a 2 1/2 hour film.. The film had quite a lot funny and witty moments, but even this was overdone with its repetitiveness. What made it worse was the cliché characters that continuously made me cringe. As a guy, the best bit about the film was Megan Fox. She is a stunningly beautiful actress and has definitely upped her performance from the first instalment. However, the writers chose to make her simply the eye- candy of the film, rather than something more worthwhile. Shia LaBeouf was amusing to say the least. I'm not sure how much acting he had to do to pull off the awe-filled eyes every time he had a scene with Megan Fox :) Lucky guy.. So if you want simple.. confusing.. fun.. senseless.. action (with hottie Megan Fox) this movie is for you. If you're expecting a more well-rounded plot with surprisingly clever twists, well.. that's not happening."

Not to give anything away but I went to the cinema to see the big machines on the big screen and would advise anyone to do the same but I wouldn't buy it. Is it me or is the picture at home now on your PS3 just much better than at the cinema? Lose most of the love story and bring back the snappy dialogue from the first film.

","Sometimes when I am referencing something I hate, and I mean really despise, I will say something along the lines of 'It's almost as bad as Transformers 2' because it's very rare I find something in existence worse than this.<br/><br/>I was impressed by the first one despite not being a Transformers fan: it had good action scenes, some funny moments and an epic soundtrack.<br/><br/>In the commentary Michael Bay stated something along the lines of he'd struggle to make a sequel because he couldn't top it. But he'd make money from a sequel anyway so why not? So I'll pick out my biggest problems with this film, in no real order: 1) Megatron is very quickly brought back to life by a shard the same thing that killed him...right...<br/><br/>2)Then when Optimus is killed they have to look for a brand new artifact rather than use the shard Mikaela has, presumably for the purpose of dragging the film out longer.<br/><br/>3)Sam Witwicky: the constant stuttering thing was kind of funny at first, but by the second film it is just irritating.<br/><br/>4)Megan Fox: she's not known as a great actor, but who cares, she's hot right? And that's one of the only reasons anyone can endure this film-to stare at her. I also dislike the way she pronounces 'Sam' as 'Seem'.<br/><br/>5) Continuing my previous point, the obsession with sexual jokes. Dogs humping? Devastator has balls? Oh they're wrecking balls. Good 'un.<br/><br/>6)Some of it just seems like adverts for sports cars.<br/><br/>7)The first film starts in the desert and ends in the city; this starts in the city and ends in the desert.<br/><br/>8)The Fallen: what's so threatening about a character that is already beaten? Then when he returns for his 'revenge' he gets killed in about five minutes.<br/><br/>9)Mr Bay himself apologized for making it...then went on to make another Transformers film 10) The twins: why? Did they see Jar Jar Binks and think 'Hey, we should have something like that! No wait...two characters like that!' This is a bad film."

It really took Michael Bay as a director to a different league and Steven Spielberg's awesome attention to detail really put the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>As an owner of the film both on HD-DVD and Blu-Ray, again unbelievable to watch many times over.<br/><br/>So I set myself up to go watch it at the IMax in Westminster and half way through the film I thought... ""What the _ _ _ _ is going on? This cannot be happening. The trailer looked amazing. These guys cannot act. There is no humour and we're half way through the film. Sure the special effects are good but pointless. What's the story - What trash is this????"" As you can imagine being over 2 and a half hours long, being disappointed half way through already meant the rest of the 2nd half was utter torture...I really wanted to walk out - really - but was with a whole group of friends so decided to play the polite game.<br/><br/>Absolute Nonsense. I had to go back home and put on Transformers Part 1 to remind myself how good that movie was...<br/><br/>What a potentially fantastic franchise killer!

Did they just skim it for keywords like: robots, fight, naked, fight, more robots, fight. What has happened to my beloved childhood cartoon from the 80's? I could go ON and ON and ON and ONNNNN about why this movie sucked, but I have to be at work on Monday so I can't take that much time.<br/><br/>Look the first Transformers was a cool flick. And I could appreciate how tough the task was for a director to formulate a story about robots that turn into cars and trucks, but he did a good job. There were pros/cons, but overall I gave it a 8/10. So I figured learn what worked and didn't work from the first movie, and head in that direction. ROTF was one step forward, five steps back.<br/><br/>Conclusion: RENT ON Blu-Ray/DVD Was NOT worth going to the theater, and it will not be worth paying money to own.

"jonathanruano","3","3","9","14 May 2010"," Transformers 2: Please Don't Make a Sequel!
","The first impression I got watching Director Michael Bay's Transformers 2 was that the transformers were the least interesting characters in the entire film - except for that yellow camaro and the tiny robot that tries to steal this rock that serves as a memory chip. In fact, the most interesting part of the movie was the first 35 minutes which can only be described as fun, goofy, easy-going silliness. We see Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and his hot girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) have a silly, but amusing argument about why neither of them can say the ""L"" word -- even though they both love each other. We see Sam go to college and make a complete fool of himself in the classroom. We see Sam meet his crazy Spanish college roommate. And all of these scenes are accompanied by very quirky dialogue. We see a slutty girl try to seduce Sam and almost succeed when all of a sudden Mikaela catches them kissing. ""Is that your girlfriend,"" the slutty girl asks. ""Ex,"" Mikaela replies. Then we see the slutty girl turn into a transformer and try to kill Sam, Mikaela saving Sam and then Sam and Mikaela getting into a heated argument over his cheating while the transformer is trying to kill both of them - and, at that point, I was thinking to myself why did Roger Ebert only give this movie one star out of a possible four? I did not have long to wait for the answer to that question.<br/><br/>What I deeply resent about this movie is that it reminds me of how arrogant the director Michael Bay really is. Here is a man who does not care at all about character development or the plot or even the dialogue, who throws hundreds of millions of dollars (maybe more) in creating special effects for more than two hours, and then expects his audience to think that he has produced a great cinematic masterpiece. How stupid does he think people are? And that's the problem with this film. There are lots of special effects, lots of underwater footage, lots of aerial pictures. lots of CGI and even the pyramids were thrown in, but who cares? In the end, all the images thrown on screen don't amount to whole lot. Most of the movie is devoted to showing transformers beating each other up like they are in a wrestling ring, which is about as entertaining and as loud as slamming two metal objects against each other again and again and again. And all this noise and all this crashing of metal parts goes on and on and on.<br/><br/>In short, the problem with Transformers 2 is that too many special effects, too much noise, too many explosions, and too much CGI do not make a better film. They make a worse film. No doubt for Michael Bay, it was absolutely necessary for all this noise of transformers crashing into each other to last for 2 hours and thirty minutes. But if they cut out one hour and focused on developing the quirky, silly and funny set-up in the beginning - not to mention doing something more with Shia LeBeouf's comedic talents rather than have him dodge explosions (after all, you Michael Bay are paying his salary. So make the most of it) - then the film would not only be less expensive. It would also be better. I am tired of films that require their audience to passively take in one big explosion after the other. There are dozens of films that have done that already and there are many more with special effects - and the whole experience is getting tired and boring. We don't expect people to only listen to ""The Animals"" from the 1960s or Jessica Simpson from the 1990s again and again and again. So why should we have to put up with films that have no plot, no characters, lots of noise and lots of CGI again and again and again. Before I conclude, the other thing I despise about this movie was that Steven Spielberg decided to write a check that was probably worth millions to finance the production of it, when he knew better (we know he knew better, because ""Schlinder's List"" is proof that he knows how to make great movies). Obviously, Spielberg gets this year's award for biggest douchbag for accompanying Michael Bay on this ego trip and thinking that they can fool everyone into thinking that Transformer 2 is any good. It's not. Thumbs way down."

","The summer of 2009 will forever be etched in my memory as a summer of terrible sequels and REVENGE OF THE FALLEN tops the list of bad movies I've seen this year. I really enjoyed 2007's TRANSFORMERS and so went into the theater with high hopes for this action-loaded sequel, and wow...we're my dreams ever crushed. When the film begins, the Autobots have been working with the US government as part of a ""top secret"" program known as NEST since the Mission City battle but the government's getting fed up with the constant Autobot/Decepticon battles. So, while the government tries to shut down NEST and send the Autobots packing to a new planet, the ancient Decepticon known as the Fallen is searching for a long-lost source of Energon on Earth in hopes of using it to raise an army.<br/><br/>Wow, looking back at that paragraph, that synopsis does sound as if it'd make for a fun movie...but it doesn't. There were so many aspects of this movie that bothered me that I probably won't even remember to mention them all here. For one, the plot does seem to have some major holes; I cannot understand how, after such a massive city-spanning battle with hundreds upon hundreds of witnesses at the end of the first film, the Autobots are now a government secret. In addition to a shaky plot, the film also suffered from some cringe-inducing performances from characters that I didn't feel were at all necessary and could've easily been scrapped. Ramon Rodriguez as Sam's new college roommate, Leo Spitz....what was the point of him? I was fed up with his childish whining within minutes and yet got to spend the entire movie with him. And, while on the topic of useless characters, the Autobot twins Skids and Mudflap were just aggravating. From the moment they arrived, I couldn't help but picture the crows from DUMBO and I kept hoping that a Decepticon would do us all a favor and take them out.<br/><br/>The remainder of the cast failed to grab my attention any better. Megan Fox didn't really come across as well as she did in the first film; I suppose now that the ogling from the first film is over it's easier to see her acting doesn't quite hold up as well. Shia LeBeouf spends the majority of the film moping, hardly his usual wisecracking self. The only ""highlights"" were John Turturro (returning as former Sector-7 agent Simmons) and Kevin Dunn & Julie White (as Sam's parents, though even they wore out their welcome after a while). The only real compliments for the film should be directed at ILM, whose visual effects and Transformer designs are just as amazing as they were on the first film. I just wish I'd had more of an opportunity to appreciate it seeing as how the action is all shown so close-up and so fast that there are points where you can't ascertain what exactly is happening in battle.<br/><br/>The second TRANSFORMERS film tries it's hardest to be epic in scope, but fails miserably and you can't help but feel time slow down as you sit through the exhausting 2.5 hour runtime (especially during the seemingly never-ending final battle). As I'd said, I know there are even more grievances that I'm neglecting to mention here but believe me when I say this movie was terrible compared to the first. Since it happened to nab more than $400 million at the domestic box office, another sequel is inevitable. Let's just hope the filmmakers get their act together and bring us another TRANSFORMERS movie we can be proud of."

From the destruction of the pyramids to robots fighting, every scene looks so realistic.<br/><br/>However, the good points seem to end there. Just like Michael Bay's previous effort ""Pearl Harbour"", the film drags on and is far too long. It is filled with mindless and pointless fighting scenes, as if they are fighting just for the sake of it. Most of the time I can't even work out whether the robot is good or bad. From the last Transformer movie, I thought the coloured robots are good and the silver ones are bad, but in this movie it seems the colour robots fight with the colour robots, silver ones fight with silver ones, and then everyone fight with each other. Bullets are coming from every direction, and I cannot work out who is shooting who. Just what is going on in the film?"

","This sequel was on my active list, because the first one was a brilliant mix between comedy, science fiction and intense action. Sadly, I watched it on my TV and lost then nearly all pleasure. So, I wanted to see part 2 on screen, but my bad luck goes on because I missed the Imax version. Having seen it thus on a normal screen, I am sure that the Imax version would have been a terrific experience! <br/><br/>I think that this sequel keeps all the great things of the first movie but all the bad things as well.<br/><br/>The positive things: the excellent cast with the teens, parents, the agent; the comedy moments; the amazing effects and the incredible tempo of the action: it is 100% adrenaline; the opening sequence at the parents' home or the car abduction left me speechless <br/><br/>The negative things: the sound effects too loud, especially the robotic ones which mute the speeches; a fragile story which isn't told simply; the last part of the movie for its length; and above all, the design of the transformers which could have been less detailed. I like the simple, pure design in the cartoons, toys, comics and they should have kept this look instead of this highly mechanic, blurry,confuse design. For example, when they fight, you can't tell what the robots doing.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a great movie for fun but in need of polish"
"siektwo","2","3","9","31 July 2009"," Transformers is a 2 and a half hour worthless mess of a film
","I'm giving it 2 stars for the SFX.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this film is horrible. I know there's plenty of fan boys that are up in arms that the critics ""don't know a good movie"" and whatnot. The reality is that this really isn't a good movie. It would be a gigantic stretch to even call this ""film"" tolerable.<br/><br/>It's 2.5 hours of explosions, screaming, and running. In between that, you have HORRENDOUS ""comic relief"" that would only tickle the funny bone of a 10yr old. Plot? Who cares. The point is to see robots fighting each other right? There is no plot, only an ending to set up another sequel. Even a 1-900 # psychic could see that coming.<br/><br/>If you like shaky cameras, horrible dialog, 150 minutes of plot holes, fight scenes where you can't make out who's hitting who, elementary school jokes, no appealing characters, hugely annoying characters, and wasting money...then this is the film for you! There is absolutely no excuse as to why this film is 2 and a half hours. I wouldn't have been so hard on it if it was 90 minutes. It would still be a terrible wretched piece of cinema, but at least it wouldn't have taken up the majority of my Saturday afternoon."
"limper106","2","3","9","29 July 2009"," Utter Drivel !!!
","Usually I ignore comments that rate a movie at 1 or 2, it can't possibly be as bad as all that. However, I registered myself on IMDb just so I could give this movie a 2. The first movie was much better in almost every aspect. The only reason I don't give it a score of 1 is because of the Devastator. The rest...horrible, hole-filled plot, stupid blithering inane dialogue, minstrelsy jokes that received utter silence and averted eyes in the theater, with head-spinning, jarring cuts dispersed randomly amid senseless slow-motion running scenes and turbulent CGI. This movie seemed to me to be edited (or possibly just directed) by a four-year-old on methamphetamines. Worst theater-going experience I've ever had. And like the man said, I saw the midnight showing of Star Wars: Episode I."
"dfle3","4","3","9","23 July 2009"," What a GREAT ad for the movie! Classic!
","Seeing the ads in cinemas for this movie made me keen to see it, despite misgivings...the ads had a great sense of drama and gravitas to them. On this site I gave the original movie 7/10 and called it a good popcorn movie, even though the early part of that movie was really bad and took a while to improve.<br/><br/>Did start hearing bad things from movie reviewers which made me think I should give this movie a miss...but a cinema chain here in Australia had a promotion where I won a discount ticket, so I waited until this movie was off the No Free List category to see it.<br/><br/>So, where does this movie go wrong? Well, at least the original movie had humour going for it...it took a while to get going, after initially being cringe-worthy. The sequel doesn't have any humour worth noting. It's not even cringe-inducing. You just have a blank expression when they try it on.<br/><br/>Worst of all, in an effort, perhaps, to compensate for the mechanical characters' lack of charisma and empathy, the movie goes down the awful George Lucas route, creating a couple of mechanical characters (known as ""Don't Know"" and ""Don't Care""...just kidding on that, although I really don't know these characters' names) modelled on Jar Jar Binks...loosely based on racial and ethnic stereotypes in the human world. Not being American, I can't say that I really find their brand of American jive-talk very entertaining at all. It's really awful...small boys may like their humour and machismo though.<br/><br/>What is watching this movie like? Well, it's like spending around two and a half hours with drunk, spaced out, self-obsessed teenagers talking about EVERYTHING...or, watching small boys play in a sandpit with Transformers toys, and listening to their running commentary-for two and half hours-...or watching teenage boys playing the new Transformers video game...for TWO AND A HALF HOURS!!!<br/><br/>Sure, there is LOTS of action in this movie. But to tell you the truth, this series ends here for me. Enough is enough. Director Michael Bay would really have only one way to 'improve' on this movie next time round...two and a half hours of a single Transformers chase where pretty much everything en route gets destroyed. Even if he did this, I wouldn't watch it...because this is just one big, stupid, action packed movie. The destruction wreaked in the first movie was entertaining. And the ads for the sequel seemed even more exciting, in this regard. But it just doesn't impress as much when married into this tedious movie.<br/><br/>Like the first movie, the film makers either seem to not know who they are pitching this movie at, or, more likely, perhaps, they are trying to appeal to all ages, which makes some of the material in this movie inappropriate to young children (there is much leering camera work in this movie of young bodies etc).<br/><br/>With regards to the sexual aspects to this movie, I must say I have been misinformed...seeing girlie calenders in motor mechanic garages, I always thought that the scantily dressed beautiful young women draped over motorcycles were being sexually exploited...turns out they were putting artwork on the bikes instead! Megan Fox's character demonstrates this early on...and you get a nice, leering shot up her shorts...think you see panty too.<br/><br/>In other words, this is about two and a half hours of things blowing up (for small boys) and titillation (for teenage boys).<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour-record the ad for this movie when it plays on TV. And when you think you want to watch the movie, watch the ad instead. It's really good!<br/><br/>Three words: T.D.S."
"dangertoy","3","3","9","11 July 2009"," If you make a movie about a kids toy, make it so kids can watch it...
","Seems simple enough to do, making a movie about a toy into a movie that the owners of those toys can watch. Seems simple, but not for Michael Bay. I can only assume that M.B. grew up playing with the plastic transformers. So WHYYYYYYYYY all the senseless crap!!! Take a cue from Peter Jackson or George Lucas on how to create an epic film without nonsense. I do not wish to spoil this movie for anyone without kids. If you do not have children and understand the difference between right and wrong- go ahead, my review cannot save you from yourself. If I had not seen the first movie and rationalized the PG-13 rating based on that criteria, I would not have taken my children to see this movie. I am by no means a radical conservative. The very fact that I took my children to see this film should attest to that. But I could not enjoy this movie because of the massive quantity of humorless vulgarities and the inescapably shallow characters. My kids seemed to enjoy it just fine, they whispered amongst themselves just about every time one of these scenes came and went. I almost walked out, and I should have, but I spent 40 bucks getting in and I kept thinking the action would keep the characters from additional dialog, which it didn't. The first movie was funny and witty with action intense but appropriate. This movie was juvenile and stupid. The action, while good, leads you into sensory overload about 1/2 way in, and there's still over 1 hour of it left. Bottom line: Michael Bay got my theater money, but he won't be getting my DVD money. And in the case of Transformers 3- Rise of the Pornobots- He won't get either."
"SophomoreSlump","3","3","9","11 July 2009"," There's NO way to write an UNBIASED review for this movie.
","I want to do justice for the franchise. So I will now write a non-biased review. But really, I can't see that happening.<br/><br/>So how about this? If you see it as a usual type of movie, of course, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an epic fail. There were no character development. The storyline – I won't even call it rushed – was a mess! So much plot holes that you can shove Optimus Prime in them and back again. There was too many missed opportunity for a better plot such as the ""Sam-as-a-fugitive"" storyline which could've been more in depth or even ""Jetfire, the old Decepticon turned good"" deserves a better story than that. And a lot of WTF moments. And one more thing, I remember the filmmaker saying that they had to write in Shia LaBeouf's hand injury -- that was also one of the WTF moments.<br/><br/>But the only way to write a good review for this movie is that you have to see it as a ""Michael Bay type"" movie. Then this is the best movie ever made. His best effort yet. There were plenty of explosions that your ears could go numb, slow-motion sequences that most probably made up half an hour of the movie, and some more explosions! There are also random Transformers running around that you won't even know who is fighting what.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone is capable of making a better ""Michael Bay type"" movie than this. Heck, I don't even think Bay himself can top this."

","First of all i'd like to say this to all the haters that they should respect everyone from directors to a minor crew member of the movie because these guys put their efforts and time in making that movie and they deserve credit and respect and if you think you guys are better then go ahead make a movie and i'm 100% sure that not matter how perfect you'll think about your movie somewhere someone's gonna give it a reviews. So, if you guys don't like Micheal Bay then don't watch the movie and don't start saying rubbish about it because in my opinion and most of the guys who watched that movie would say that this movie is absolutely brilliant in every way. Well if you're a G1 fan then don't expect it to be like G1 cartoons because it's not and it's absolutely not based on reality and i'll call this movie a sci fi fantasy which is entertaining in every way. I'd like to say that a sci fi movie means it's gonna be full of entertaining bullshit and if you're looking for realism then you better watch Valkyrie instead of this one. It got a pretty good plot but i wont say it's perfect because nothing's perfect in this world anyway. So, get ready to see whole lot of Autobots and Decepticons battle."
"NJRocker091188","7","3","9","10 July 2009"," Yes
","First I just want to say that all you dissing this film are just winy nerds that for some reason think that Transformers needs a good plot, or have really short attention spams and shouldn't go going out to movie in the first place. <br/><br/>I will admit that this film does not have the nice cool cheese ball lines the first one had, and does lack a little bit in plot. However, the action is just as great as the first, special effects are just a great as the first, and the humor is almost as funny. I did not really see anything wrong with the script, no need for charioteer development because they accomplishment in the first film. There is no need for the film to be any shorter because then there wouldn't be enough room for all the excellent fight/ battle scenes that look place in the film. The film also needed to be long to explain who the fallen is, and why Sam is having these strange sighting of symbols, and where they were located, and why O.Prime is the only one that can defeat The Fallen. <br/><br/>Any ways. Despite a few flaws I believe this film is excellent. But I wouldn't recommend this film for those that can't take a joke, or do not have a very strong sense of humor. Because there is some crude humor, but again that does not make this film bad. I still say Excellent."
"maguskrool","3","3","9","9 July 2009"," Good special effects, mostly cool robots, forget all else
","Plot: Was there one? Plot holes and a showcase for the American military, perhaps. 1. Sam finds a fragment of the most important and thought to be lost forever Cybertronian artifact, and he gives it to his girlfriend and doesn't even mention it to Optimus. 2. Sam's kitchen bursts with tiny Decepticons and Bumblebee doesn't ask him about it? And doesn't tell Optimus either? 3. The Primes sacrifice themselves to encase the Matrix Key with their ""it takes a shot or two to get through"" bodies, instead of staying alive, hiding or not. 4. The Decepticons are running low on Energon, but they squander it creating more of them (not quite well explained either) and letting some of them die of weakness. 5. The Decepticons depend on that last shard - apparently there's two of those - of the Matrix. When they locate Sam's, do they send Ravage and the other deadly Decepticon? No, they send an incompetent Wall-E. And WHY the leg humping? 6. The Decepticons apparently have the tech to disguise as humans, making it possibly easier to find all sorts of secrets, infiltrate whatever is not maximum security, but they chose to infiltrate a college campus. 7. The shard can turn machines into Decepticons, but apparently nothing ever turns into an Autobot. 8. Devastator could have beaten the crap out of everyone in the battle but I guess it's preferable to try to do all at once and keep your giant monster away from the enemies he might kill quickly. And wait, it's safe beneath him, he's never going to remember to crush you. 9. Decepticons arrive on Earth falling from space, but nobody seems to notice and do something about preventing that. 10. There was perhaps a point in kidnapping Sam's parents, but that was lost as well.<br/><br/>Also, falling and being thrown around like puppets doesn't break anyone's bones and rarely draws a drop of blood. The college scenes are soft core, there's little about Sam's ambitions and depth, even less about Mikaela's. The army veterans fight the meany ""suits"", who ""just don't understand"" them. People just bounce around the globe so they can fight robots in the desert. Again.<br/><br/>Dialogue: I hadn't seen these many one-liners and clichés since Catwoman. I winced at Optimus's ""I rise, you fall"". Plenty of silly comedy, the only thing that happens when robots aren't shooting or ripping each other to pieces. Starscream probably has the best lines and is loyal to his cartoon persona.<br/><br/>Acting: Sorry Megan Fox, I know the dialogue is terrible, but you belong in a centerfold. The rest is average, uneven.<br/><br/>Robots: The bots look cool, wish I could actually take a good look at most of them and try to discern their features and understand what I was looking at. Aside from half a dozen, all robots are extras, soldiers. I would care more for the robots being hurt and destroyed if I at least knew their names. The two very, very bad stereotypical Autobots get more camera time than Ironhide or Ratchet, or the new Arcees. Some of them have abilities that you'd think all of them could benefit from, and probably obtain. But they don't.<br/><br/>Humans: Wow, so many military people. I know the movie has to focus on human and robot relations, but the generals and such, who nobody cares about, got more camera time than many Autobots.<br/><br/>There's more, but I guess I made my point."

","I'm 17, so I was supposed to love Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen right? It had everything from Optimus Prime to Megan Fox. What's not to like? The answer: plenty.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I'm a Michael Bay fan. I loved Armageddon and Bad Boys, and I was a fan of the first Transformers film. But Bay messed up big time with the sequel. Normally, I'd try to find ways to defend Bay, but this is his fault. The skill he showed in his previous summer blockbusters is gone. Even though Bay screws up big time, it's not entirely his fault.<br/><br/>While the robot cast is terrific (Peter Cullen should get an Oscar nom for his portrayal of Optimus), most of the human cast is dreadful. Don't get me wrong, I like Shia LaBeouf, but he's really trying too hard in this flick. He stutters half his lines and when he's not doing that, he's just yelling nonsense. As if that's not bad enough, he gets more Razzie help with his annoying parents and an equally annoying roommate. On the contrary, the Transformers girls, Fox and Isabel Lucas, are great additions to this film. For the ladies, there's Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson, but he barely gets any time. And John Tuturro, genius in the first film, is superb, but by the time he hits the screen (about an hour and a half into the film) it's a lost cause.<br/><br/>Even the robots are not safe from error. There's these two annoying robots who are bound to stir up some type of controversy. They are annoying, rude, and unnecessary. In addition, the main villain, the titular Fallen, is introduced, but then forgotten about and not revisited until an hour later. Rest assured, this happens numerous times, which also leads to questions about the length (a crappy 2 1/2 hours) Overall, Transformers 2 was a big, loud mess. As far as robot movies go, Terminator Salvation was much better. Call me what you will, but I did not like it. Everyone I know loved it, but maybe that's another thing. The hype machine was overflowed, so maybe that's why I was disappointed. But who knows? Maybe you're asking the wrong guy. Need proof? While my friends waited for this, I'm just counting the days until Inglourious Basterds comes out. But heed my warning. Don't transform your cash into a ticket for a crappy movie"

","Johnny: Tell me a Story Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Bay: Okay so this guy Sam has a car that becomes a giant robot named Bumblebee. They had many adventures together, like when Sam goes off to college, but can't because the giant robot Semi OPTIMUS PRIME needs Sams help instead, and they go off to that one place to do that one thing and meet those one guys. Then Giant robots start fighting and break a lot of things, Then there's these 2 Retarded (Steve Urkle wannabees) robots that follow him around for no reason. Anyway the world will blow up unless they find the Matrix.....The End.<br/><br/>Johnny: WTF was THAT! You didn't even try, did you even work on this film?<br/><br/>___________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Firstly, lemme say ""STOP DESTROYING MY CHILDHOOD ICONS"". Every fanboy knows that in Transformers there was a set of Twins named SIDESWIPE and SUNSTREAKER. If we wanted twins in this movie, why did we disregard Sunstreaker and create the 2 worst characters in cinema since JAR JAR BINKS? Okay so we at least added a new G1 Face (Sideswipe), but lets ruin it more, he's not even red.....in fact, lets make him Silver like every other robot in this film. Okay, so lets add 3 more classic favorites...ARCEE, CHROMIA and MOONRACER, the only Female Autobots we've ever had.....and completely ruin them into these UNICYCLE-riding Worms with no form of a body whatsoever, and show them for about 10 seconds. Instead lets follow the RETARDICONS, which are so annoying that even BUMBLEBEE slams on them...physically.<br/><br/>Secondly, there was no character development at all in this movie. We added new robots, barely mentioned any names, didn't explain who they were, where they came from or why we should even care. That goes for both sides. There's an army of Decepticons who apparently won't die. We see dead robots from the first movie return as well as multiple Constructicons, some being part of DEVASTATOR and some fighting singly at the exact same time over the next dune.<br/><br/>I can't even glorify this movie as a 2 hour car commercial nor a Toy Commercial. It might as well have been 2 guys rolling 20 sided dice for what each characters next move was, because it felt that long and drawn out. They might as well been throwing POKEMON cards in saying ""MY DEVASTATOR WILL ATTACK YOU"". ""Yeah, well I play my INSECTICON"". ""I see your Insecticon, and call on my RAVAGE"". ""You killed my Optimus PIKACHU"".<br/><br/>You can't throw in all these things with no explanation of what a CONSTRUCTICON is, what an INSECTICON is, what a RAVAGE is, and most interestingly enough....what a PRETENDER is. This would be the Hot Blonde College girl who tries to kill SAM. There used to be toys called PRETENDERs. They were SKIN on the outside, but a robot underneath. This was the only cool thing I saw in this movie and it lasted 3 minutes maybe. Fanboys recognized also JETFIRE and WHEELIE, which in no way came close to their predecessors. I understood this movie for the most part, but then again 30 years plus of Hardcore FANBOY living, ya pick up a few things. NEWBIES are completely freaking lost.<br/><br/>Megan Fox just spoke out about this not being a film about ACTING, and MICHAEL BAY tore her apart for it calling her childish and immature, knowing nothing about what the fans want. I think the real problem here is MICHAEL BAY. I haven't heard anything out of his mouth that's not I, ME or MY. Judging by these reviews, the Lovely Miss FOX is Absolutely right and BAY doesn't know what the fans want. I've seen and heard about things that were supposed to be in this movie that could only make it better. One being the return of more of the original voice artists, aside from Welker (who still should've been Megatron, and Soundwave sounds like Inspector Gadget should be chasing him.) I'm tired of Hollywood telling us to shut up and take it as they butcher our beloved treasures, claiming artistic rights or it'll make it better. If it's not broken, don't fix it. If you think I'm wrong, try making ROOTS with an all white cast, or Little Orphan Annie with the JONAS BROTHERS. And lets keep letting them shove IGNORANT characters down our throat like SKIDS/Mudflap, JAR JAR BINKS, Will Ferrall...etc. After this disappointment, all I can say is that GI JOE had better be DAMN GOOD! Until All Are One...and we are all watching a better TF movie from Stephen Spielberg."

","All that I can say is that after watching Transformers 2, I have started to like the first one. You will just see all that was bad about the first one multiplied by ten and a lot of pointless explosions and to-quick-for-the-eye fighting scenes. But if you think about it, it is all our fault. Why do they make movies like this: because they know that it will sell. Michael Bay knows that the only thing essential to make a movie earn millions is to have lots of action, stupid jokes and Megan Fox. He knows that a plot and dialogs are not the important thing and the 200 millions in the box office proves it. This will not change unless people show directors and producers that we are ready for a change. Until that day comes... I quote Megatron's immortal words: ""This isn't over yet"""

I'd heard about Transformers- who hasn't?- and well, it just didn't quite appeal to me.<br/><br/>My friend FINALLY bugged me enough that I bought the DVD and watched it last January. And well- it rocked. I've seen it maybe three or four times- short attention span means that I can barely sit through it- and I loved it.<br/><br/>So when Transformers 2 commercials started popping up, I was sold. I knew that the day it came out, I'd have to see it.<br/><br/>Last Friday I saw it the first time. I just saw it again today. And my god, does it ever rock.<br/><br/>The Fallen, the Matrix, Jetfire, Mudflap and Skids, a Decepticon in the National Air and Space Museum, ancient symbols- BETTER THAN THE FIRST!!!! Sure, my favorite Decepticons (Barricade, Mustang Police Car and Frenzy, funny little robot guy) didn't make an appearance, but the fact that the movie rocked more than made up for it.<br/><br/>It had it's slow moments, I must admit- but how many times during a movie can you honestly say there are no slow moments? Never, I think.<br/><br/>Reviews for this movie have seemed bad, saying it's crass (like Crank 2, which was like a cheap porno) and it sucks. But, obviously, these people were in the wrong theater. Not often can someone with my ten second attention span sit for two hours and thirty minutes without dying of boredom.<br/><br/>People who go see this movie- know that it's quite possibly better than the first by far."

","The Americans really know how to make movies. Everything thing Michael Bay touches explodes with entertainment, Transformers 2 was no exception. I enjoyed every moment but at 2h30m maybe a not so avid fan might think it drags on a touch, and id like to remind them the autobots are the brightly coloured ones. The only bad thing id have to say about it was that it was not as nicely rounded as the first which was perfectly formed with the right amounts of action, comedy, sci-fi and transforming. This was only because, as with many sequels, they had to make it so hugely spectacular so that it wouldn't disappoint. They also seemed to go for more funny-silly than funny clever with annoying parents and various robots.<br/><br/>But 2 dislikes out of hundreds of things to like about this movie is not bad, its still the best cinema trip i have made and are likely to make this year. The scenes are explosive, locations are hot, the acting is pretty accomplished and there are of course one or two heart wrenching moments that make up a blockbuster like this.<br/><br/>So if you want to go see a really great film this summer that gives you your moneys worth, go see Transformers-Revenge of the Fallen.(especially if you liked the first)"

"timcarr","4","3","9","1 July 2009"," An awful sequel
","For the record, I thought the first transformers movie was a fine start for a live action transformers trilogy. I did have some gripes with it (Mainly being that the transformers themselves didn't seem to have that much screen time, much less fighting each other). But I figured, hey, Michael Bay will take the time to learn from the first movie and make an even better sequel!<br/><br/>BOY was I wrong.<br/><br/>First, I will give you some of the positives about this film.<br/><br/>1. More giant robot action 2. More slomo Megan Fox (If you're into that kind of thing) 3. More interaction between the decepticons, Particularly Megatron and Starscream, giving them a truer G1 feel<br/><br/>And now Lets get to the negatives<br/><br/>1. Most of the autobots that I looked forward to seeing were basically ABSENT the entire film. I want to say that besides Optimus and ""the twins"" (More on them in a bit) no autobot had more than two lines the entire film. Yes we did get more robot action in a sense but none of it really mattered to me when I barely knew any of the characters fighting. Some of the new additions had virtually no lines and were barely even featured in the movie. To complete the ensemble we also have Simmons and Roommate who are almost as annoying to watch. Overall very disappointing.<br/><br/>2. ""The Twins"". I'm sure if you haven't seen the movie, most of you have heard about this lovable duo. WOW are they annoying! Just blatant stereotypes of uneducated hood rats, complete with a gold tooth and little to no reading skills. Truly a pain too watch throughout the movie, especially considering they could have used the screen time to focus on much better characters they already had.<br/><br/>3. The humor. They took the humor from the first movie, and basically cracked that baby all the way to 11. And if you think that's a good thing, boy I wish I had your sense of humor, cause all I got was a load of static. Seriously though at times the humor seemed so forced and unnecessary I wanted throw something at the screen. Needless to say a majority of the jokes includes robo-balls, old man behind, robo-humping, dog-humping, robo-genetalia... You get the picture. Crude, rude, and 100% unoriginal<br/><br/>4. The Plot. I won't spoil much of anything, but I just want to say there are some parts that still have me shaking my head. The writing was not exactly top notch either, suffice to say I had to cringe every once in awhile to think ""Did he/she really just say that?""<br/><br/>Too top it all off, the film goes on for a long time, long enough where near the end I had a head-ache from watching everything going on. In the end, I really didn't care too much what happened because the best of the movie had already past and I was just waiting for it too end. Some may like this just to get their daily dose of intense action scenes,which were fantastic, but not enough to save this movie from being entertaining for anyone that wants more than a mass of cgi and lame sex jokes. <br/><br/>Oh and before I forget<br/><br/>5. Devastator, Nothing like the original version and completely useless at that. Seemed more like a slow dying gorilla.<br/><br/>See this only If you do not have to pay money."

","If my ears did not deceive me, about an hour into this marathon, one TV announcer says the on-going Decepticon attack is the worst terror event ""since 9-11,"" and another replies that President Obama (real name of the current U.S. president actually used here) has gone into hiding in a ""bunker."" Why on earth would director Michael Bay want to imply that the 44th president is a craven coward, as the 43rd was accused of being when he actually DID hide in a bunker on 9-11? Is Bay suggesting that if the president of 2009 were WHITE, he'd attack the Decepticons personally, as Bill Pullman went after the aliens toward the end of INDEPENDENCE DAY, but since Obama is BLACK he would order his minions to boot the heroic Autobots off our planet, while adding insult to injury by sacrificing the hero of the first movie to the aircraft carrier sinkers?! If John Adams still were president and had such a slanderous smear launched against him by a member of the popular media, he'd slap Bay into prison for sedition. Hopefully, Obama will stick to his guns and precedent, and do the same to Bay, so that the rest of us can benefit from new direction for TRANSFORMERS 3!"

","You have no Idea of what you're speaking of. This movie was intended for those who saw the cartoons and followed the series years ago. All of the pieces in this movie were placed together strategically to make some of us remember what our childhood passions were. There were a lot of values being displayed throughout the movie. Courage, respect, responsibility, love, affection and humor. Now, if you can't appreciate that, stop blaming it on the movie, watch the cartoons and get your self a human heart. Pay close attention and re-scan the movie for all of these values and you'll find yourself watching one of the best movies you've seen in your diminutive life. This was a great movie but not the movie for you. It is clear that you don't care enough about it to take it to a level in which the movie becomes your surroundings. Next time you visit the theaters, WATCH CAREFULLY don't just look at things.<br/><br/>-Rafael Jimenez"
"guitardude1986","3","3","9","30 June 2009"," Too bad this FILM can't ""transform"" into something else
","I'll give the good news first- the movie has excellent special effects (9/10) and a decent soundtrack (7/10). The bad news is that effects and music are the only good news.<br/><br/>Almost the entire movie was over-acted, though I honestly don't think the actors can be totally to blame when they're given such awful lines. In addition, they're working with a plot that has holes so big, I could drive Optimus Prime through them. I can handle chick-flicks any day of the week, but the ""romance"" in this movie was almost painful to watch; it was so unbelievably cheesy. As for its comedic elements, I only remember laughing once or twice despite repeated attempts at humor. Probably 65% of the movie was action and fight sequences, so I have a feeling that (in a feeble attempt to maintain some balance of plot, action, drama, romance, humor, etc.) the writers overcompensated, trying to cram everything else into that remaining 35%. The voices for most of the Transformers are over-the-top stereotypical of certain groups and races of people, and I wouldn't be surprised if they were downright offensive to many people. At 2.5 hours, the movie is pretty long, and though I am easily entertained, I was actually bored by the end of the movie and wanted it to end.<br/><br/>Now, bad acting, plot holes, sappy romance, etc. are all fine if it's a kids' movie or something, but it can't even be classified as that because it is so needlessly crude- I think I saw humping no less that three times. There were several unnecessary butt shots and references to balls, testicles, and a scrotum. There was drug material, and there was twice as much foul language as the first movie. I mean, come on- these are hardly elements of a kids' movie.<br/><br/>On top of all that, I fail to see how this movie has anything to do with the classic Transformers universe. They just took the basic premise and the classic characters and completely fabricated a new universe and storyline. How disappointing for people actually familiar with the original!...<br/><br/>Anyways, to sum up- for all of the ridiculous hype, I would have expected this movie to be at least on par with the first movie (which was at least average), but it failed to reach even that mediocre level. I'm a sucker- I paid $10.25 to see this film, and I seriously regret it. Please learn from my mistake and do not give this movie anymore money. If you must see it, please wait for it to come out on video, then rent it. Then you will see what I am talking about.<br/><br/>I give 3 stars instead of 1, simply because the special effects rocked."
"jbeattie76-1","10","3","9","30 June 2009"," What's the big deal?
","Alright, of all the movies to actually try and take seriously, this really isn't it. What are all the bad reviews about? Were these people (critics mostly) actually taking this film seriously? It has talking robots, and the kid from Holes, for Christ's sake. I saw this movie a couple nights ago, my expectations going in were this: <br/><br/>""Gee Whiz, I'm going to see a lot of things blowing up...""<br/><br/>That's about it. I wasn't expecting it to have (even) decent dialog, or even an actual plot; I expected to see a lot of things blow up while I eat my popcorn. That's what this movie is. The ultimate summer- blockbuster popcorn movie for the action fan. This is the summer time, is it not? This is the season for over-the-top dumb movies, where things go ""BOOM."" So I say to you: Go and enjoy this film, for it's explosions, it's amazing (but inconsistent) special effects, and it's mission to just entertain. And that's what it will do, as dumb as it is, it will entertain...<br/><br/>Also this is a Michael Bay movie, has this guy ever made a movie that made sense? No, so buy you're d-a-m-n popcorn, and watch the d-a-m-n movie!"
"henri-rindesalu","6","3","9","30 June 2009"," Disappointment... a major disappointment.
","Surprisingly i had really high expectations for this movie. I didn't even check IMDb. Which in my case is odd cause I always read comments before going to the cinema. I LOVED the first one, so I just expected Bay to get this as right as Nolan did on The Dark Knight... Silly me.<br/><br/>In movies like this I can usually put up with cheesy clichés, dumb third grade jokes and .... who am i kidding, NO I CANNOT! I cannot believe i went to watch this movie with my girlfriend.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf thinks that good acting equals repetitive screaming and stuttering. Megan Fox is unbelievable, literally. The plot is just a big gaping hole. Micheal Bay took the first film, amplified it by 200% and threw the story in the trash. But as long as he gets the cash, I guess it's okay. Every character in the film doesn't have to be a comedian! Particularly a bad and an annoying one (the twins). The story is... well there is no story.<br/><br/>Personally I'm puzzled by the choice to put this film into production. What were they thinking?? Can't they tell good from bad?<br/><br/>Furthermore, if I were an actor that starred in the first Transformers I would never agree to a script like that. I mean I wrote better essays than that in high school. My point is, they screwed up the franchise. I feel sorry for the fans including myself for paying to see this pile of crap.<br/><br/>My suggestion is, if you only want to see big explosions and destruction. Plus you're capable of blocking out all the utter mix of nonsense that this film is, then go and catch it on the big screen. Otherwise save yourself of the disappointment and go buy a six-pack instead.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>I wrote this while still being angry at Mr. Bay for not making me care about the characters. I'll give it a 6/10. 5 for the mind blowing effects. 1 for the silly little plot.<br/><br/>Bay should stick to effects (which he does best) and let other people worry about the plot. That way we might even get a great movie."
"ravenbh","5","3","9","28 June 2009"," All flash no bang
","Let me start this by saying that I have been a Transformers (TF) fan since day one. I still have my G1 Optimus Prime. I know most of the names by heart and I have every word memorized from the animated movie.<br/><br/>This being said one would think that anything with Autobots and Decepticons would tickle my fancy and normally you'd be right. I loved the first movie and wore out 4 dvds working on #5. (they just will not play anymore.:)Unfortunately this movie left me wanting my Hard Borrowed 10 bucks back and made me feel like Michael Bay killed my best friend. <br/><br/>The FX were stunning but FX can only make up half of a good movie. Like raw sugar hitting a soar tooth, after awhile I found my eyes throbbing and my head pounding trying to keep up with the hyper fast movements and the ear splitting sounds. I lost most of the dialog in the over use of sound FX.<br/><br/>Though I recognized a lot of the TF I felt as though 3 of them were robbed of a back story. They made several mentions of these three appearing in the last 2 years and how they were kinda suspicious only to wait 2.5 hours for one to have one line. Then 2 of the 3 were destroyed. All that mystery, all that build up and nothing to show for it.<br/><br/>In the first movie you got to know the the main characters Bumble bee Prime Sam etc. It was as if I was reliving my childhood all over again. In this one there was little introductions and even less dialog that was not yelling over the explosions. There was no real beginning, middle and end. Even the cartoons when a major toy or character was introduced that character had at least an episode or a good part of one to get to know and understand them and this was 22 minutes or less. Grimlock and the dinobots being only one example of this.<br/><br/>The one thing that really grinded my gears though, was Optimus. He was my first and is still my favorite TF, as I mentioned above, Prime has always been a soldier, a fighter tempered with wisdom. He entered each battle with respect for his enemy and although in the cartoons no one was ever destroyed totally he entered each battle knowing he had no other choice and he himself may not walk away. You could hear the pain in his voice. A good example of this was in the animated movie just before Prime fell to Megatron. He said ""Megatron must be stopped no matter the cost."" It was not what he said but the way he said it. TF1 had this feel even more so at the end. ""You left me no other choice my brother.""<br/><br/>In TF2 Prime was cocky almost arrogant. He shot an unarmed Transformer in the head with little to no remorse and then lines <br/><br/>Megatron: ""Would you sacrifice our people for one human?""<br/><br/>Optimus: ""You wouldn't stop at just one.""<br/><br/>All while Sam is running for his life. As though if Megatron would have stopped at just Sam well that would be okay. there was no wisdom in those lines. <br/><br/>Then all that built up noise and the final battle pitters out like a 2 year old bottle rocket thhhhhhit pop....yay... The only words in my head was ""all that for nothing."" <br/><br/>My final thoughts:<br/><br/>It is a good flick for what it is, A time killer. Its sad it had the name transformers on it but for mind numbed shinny things moving from one side then blurring to the other its okay. I find myself wishing I had waited till the DVD came to a bargain bin at Wal-mart though, at least then I would have more for my 10 bucks then a headache and a slip of paper that says ""TRANSFORE"".<br/><br/>Simply put, wait till it hits the discount movie houses and if you are not lucky enough to have one, wait for it on DVD and rent it."
"jcb119","10","3","9","28 June 2009"," Don't Believe the critics
","First of all most of the people who are thinking this is a terrible movie are wrong. This movie was JUST as good as the first one. The only real reason it did not feel better was because it wasn't as new and breathtaking as he first transformers movie. This movie had TONS more action and the ONLY thing that was a little bit wrong was the amount of different plots they tried to squeeze in this movie. It got a little tiring. It didn't ruin the movie it had just a lot more story than the first which sometimes steals from the action WHICH THERE IS A LOT OF!! Those critics who are saying this movie was not as good as the first where wrong it was JUST as good (which is amazing) and has a lot more action and robots. The only thing that could have been better was the fact that they put a lot of unnecessary plot into it. Otherwise it would have been BETTER than the first!"

"bramb600","5","3","9","27 June 2009"," Not worth your time.
","This movie is the sequel to the 2007 adaptation of the Transformers toys and cartoon series. The plot is exceptionally awful. Basically Sam Witwicky is going off to college. At the same time the Decepticons are planning an attack on the Autobots and a whole war is starting up. Sam finds that he still has a piece of the Allspark cube that was destroyed in the first movie and when he looks at it the symbols get imprinted into brain, which the Decepticons are after. Also, another unrelated part of the story involves a robot named The Fallen who wants to destroy the sun with a machine hidden in the pyramids. I didn't fully understand the plot, therefore I won't be able to explain the entire plot. These elements in the script are really not related and you can tell one story being completely dropped and forgotten about.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is never a requirement but I'm still going to comment on it. I thought that Shia LaBeouf actually gave a great performance in this movie and he's definitely overqualified for Transformers. If he were to be in a drama, he would be great.<br/><br/>Now, Megan Fox is only in the movie because she's hot and that may be true, however she's a terrible actress.<br/><br/>John Turturro who actually has a much larger part in this movie than he has in the first film. He's clearly in the movie as a comic relief and the jokes involving his character are sometimes very absurd.<br/><br/>Getting off the topic of performances, I would like to mention that the action in this movie is bigger and better than the first film. There's so much more robots fighting if that's what you're into. The CGI is also incredible with the very detailed robots. There are many parts to them, but this could be a disadvantage because a lot of them look like a bunch of metal pieces stuck together with faces. However, you could tell that the budget was very large on this movie because there's practically a new thing exploding in every scene. By now this is Michael Bay's trademark and it can really get old quickly.<br/><br/>There were some improvements in this movie that really bothered me in the first movie. The major improvement was that Michael Bay actually managed to keep the camera still for a lot of the movie, so I can actually tell exactly what was going on in a robot fight. In the first movie, he would constantly be moving the camera and you wouldn't be able to tell what was going on. However, there was one scene where Shia LaBeouf's character is saying goodbye to his girlfriend played by Megan Fox before he goes to college and the camera constantly circles very fast and it really wasn't necessary.<br/><br/>The difference is that the plot was a pretty good in the first movie around all the action sequences. In the sequel, the story is much worse as I have mentioned before. One part that bothered me is when Shia LaBeouf left college suddenly and never came back after only being there for a few minutes. We never saw that again and it was never explained if he ever even went back.<br/><br/>When I was reading the reviews before I saw the movie, everyone was mentioning The Twins who were extremely racist stereotypes. A lot of the things they said were too offensive and crude but they didn't offend me that much. I didn't like the addition of the gold teeth and the fact they couldn't read, but other than that they made me laugh. They just didn't need as much screen time as they were given.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Transformers 2, is that it is way too long. It's about 2 & ½ hours and just six minutes longer than in 2007. This movie could have easily trimmed out a half hour just from the useless comedy scenes and maybe it would have been bearable. I started looking at my watch about an hour and a ½ in. I would even stop paying attention to the action sequences because I had become so bored near the end that I just wanted it to be over.<br/><br/>I would also like to talk about the IMAX. I honestly can't say that it's a good idea to watch it in IMAX. You assume that it's a bigger screen and more enjoyable but for most of the movie it's only using the middle of the screen with some specific scenes that are shot with an IMAX camera. I'll have to admit that the IMAX shots were incredible and really made me feel like I was actually there with them in the desert. When it's being used, it's even more impressive than 3D, it's just that it's not used enough to pay five dollars extra for a ticket.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't honestly say that I enjoyed the movie more than the first one, so I guess that means I believe the first movie was better. I'm fine with that, it's just that I still didn't like the first one because it was boring and had similar flaws this movie had. Overall, this is just a bad franchise and I actually wouldn't mind if I never see a third one. Even if they improve it, there's no more stories left to even keep it interesting.<br/><br/>So, that's my review of the film. I give it a 5/10, and I personally don't recommend it. However, if you're a big fan of explosions than this is the movie for you. What should you see instead if you don't like explosions? Probably The Hangover again."

","Everyone that is going to take you children to see this movie, please take a close look at the rating...PG13.

This movie runs on the border of rated R with all of the fowl language and inappropriate scenes.<br/><br/>Dogs humping each other, character humping other female character's leg and being OK with it, @ss, balls, scrotum, and many other fowl language statements with some being constantly repeated.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the intense sci-fi scenes.

"gabrielescolan","3","3","9","27 June 2009"," An expected disappointment
","There's not much to say about this movie,than the obvious fact that it was the sequel of a terrible first movie. This second part repeat the same formula, consisting of showing outstanding special effects and dismissing any trace of a solid story. Like in the first one the plot was so ridiculous that even the amazing figths between the robots could save this movie from the disaster. In this occasion Mr.Bay, at least, has the vision of not using some stupid characters from the first one, the only trouble was that he changed them for other stupids characters, plus the fact that he made more stupids other characters that on the first movie passed as mediocre fun characters (f.e Sam's parents). Another weak point about the movie is that is so long that if you're not an eight years old kid you won't be able to avoid feeling sleepy in the middle of the movie and It's because after the first fifteen minutes you keep watching until the end credits a non interesting succession of images. Don't misinterpret me I can enjoy funny movies, I liked Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, and others and I do believe that you can do a fun Sci-Fiction movie with great special effect and also a great story, if you don't believe me just look The Matrix."
"darth-tobe","4","3","9","27 June 2009"," I do hope revenge will come!
","This review contains harsh language. There are also a number of spoilers. Neither are avoidable, so if you are offended by either do not read on. I had such high expectations. I was not going to be discouraged by the initial reviews. Sadly, this time I have to agree. Yes, it's big, it's loud, it has dizzyingly impressive visuals and big explosions, and transforming alien robots. The problem is, it's also in this order. The Transformers - the namesakes of this production, for crying out loud - come last. Apart from them the film is more like a big-budget advertising reel for the US army. The only thing missing are directions on where to sign up.<br/><br/>The Transformers seem to be there mainly to provide a reason for America to mobilise against something - and for comic relief. Take the ""twins"". Take the little ""spybot"". Take Jetfire (in the source material one of the most powerful Autobots). Take Bumblebee: His character is reduced to a fierce but cute guard doggy for Spike. At the end of the last film he had learnt to speak. Now he's back to making unintelligible but adorable sounds. Even Starscream (my favourite): He was introduced as one of the most dangerous of all Decepticons in the previous film, where he took on several Autobots and armies of human soldiers. Now he's little more than an embarrassingly comical coward.<br/><br/>The first half or so of the movie is actually fairly promising with some clever Decepticon trickery and introducing some of my favourite characters (like Soundwave, Ravage, the Constructicons or Arcee). They even bring back Megatron - which still adds a star to this rating. Then follow some episodes about family, college life and how bloody omni-present the CIA are. In the end, though, most of the big heroics - and most of the screen time - go to US soldiers showing off their impressive equipment and response times. Note that in the beginning China's military takes no action - they wait for the US to save the day. Note also that the Autobots actually live as shiny cars in a US army base and only get hoisted around when they are needed - like extras. Then, when we finally get to the climatic battle I had to sit and watch helplessly as Devastator (in the source the ultimate Decepticon fighting machine) is taken out by some damn US secret weapon and an entire Decepticon army is wiped out by an American air strike. The Autobots, who also take part in the battle, are mainly seen in the background shooting at nothing in particular. The face-off between Optimus Prime and the Fallen then comes almost as an after-though. As in: ""oh, yes, we still have to finish off that part of the plot."" Now, the source material has always involved the army. It is, after all, about war. That's generally fine. So, in the first film it was tolerable since it also preserved some classic moments. Or so I felt. This one, however, has clearly crossed the line. All I see here is that some great source material has been raped - yes, raped! - so that Americans can once again feel good about their eff-ing army.<br/><br/>I went to see this film to see - well, surprise! - the Transformers. What I got was a story about how America's army is so cool they can even take on alien robots. So, maybe this film should be more appropriately named ""USA and the Transformers"". After the first film I had tears in my eyes for finally seeing the material come the big screen. After this my eyes almost watered again. Only this time it was tears of disappointment and frustration. This film was obviously only made to make more big money with a big franchise and Megan Fox wearing tight outfits. I'm afraid and sad it may even work. I feel this is an insult to the community that so loves these characters. I hope we can go on as if this hadn't happened. I say it now and I mean it: I will not watch any third instalment if it is still Michael Bay and his creative team producing it."

",".....and boy, was this movie full of them. True, the story was lacking, but I was expecting that going in (as so few sequels actually match or top the original). And since I despise Shia LaBeouf, I already knew that the acting would be sub-par. So really, there were no surprises for me going in....except an endless barrage of jokes (and I use the term VERY loosely) and situations which are apparently supposed to pass as ""humor"". Robot testicles, a pair of smack talking, black sounding robots, numerous sexual encounters, a mother acting like a mental patient after ingesting weed brownies, a grown man in a jock strap and, yes, even a couple of fart jokes. All those things are funny when you're about 9. After that you stop laughing and start saying ""dear god, this is pathetic"". I wouldn't mind humor in a Transformers movie, providing that its humor that is A) actually funny and B) a form of humor more sophisticated than god damn fart jokes! I can't even begin to tell you how those things (I refuse to acknowledge them as jokes) ruined this movie for me.<br/><br/>I admit, the action is pretty cool, the CGI is amazing, I got to see the Constructicons form into Devestator (which was awesome, thank god they got it right this time) and I got to see my favorite Transformers character, Soundwave, on the big screen (including Ravage!). It was a shame that we didn't get to see Soundwave and the Constructicons for longer, but at least they were there.<br/><br/>However, even though I did like some things, the insulting attempt at humor the movie made was absolutely unforgivable. If this is what is supposed to be funny, I cringe for the future of comedy. Whoever wrote this drivel needs to be horsewhipped."

","Was looking forward to being able to take my children to a movie that they would enjoy, they love Optimus and Bumblebee, didn't think that I would need to look up the movie rating. I Expected it to be done with the same taste as the first one. The sexual innuendos that were ever-present through the entire movie, seemed that they would be more comfortable in a 30 minute episode of Jack-Ass. They were crude and misplaced in a movie that many parents are taking small children to view. I would expect something more from a movie that boasted a $200Million budget. The special effects and fight scenes were Top-Notch. But we are led to believe that an alien life form so far advanced as these robots would use foul language and even hump a pretty girl's leg? I would have given the movie a 10/10 rating had it not been for these two issues. If I had known, that it was NOT what I would term: ""Family Oriented"", I would not have taken my 3 children to see it."
"enten-eller","3","3","9","27 June 2009"," Not very entertaining
","I thought this movie was relatively boring. Most transformers fans disregard the transformers ""haters"" comments as irrelevant as they fail to see what this movie was made for. It was not made to be a cinematic masterpiece, but a blockbuster which would entertain the audience for 2 hours and 27 minutes. So does it succeed in being entertaining? In my opinion it does not. Watching action sequences can be entertaining for a while, but unless there is a reason for the viewer to care about what happens during the action sequences, they quickly become boring. In my opinion, this movie does not leave the viewer with any reason to care about what happens during the action sequences, and the initial fascination quickly turns into boredom, especially in the last hour of this movie. This is also why I think other Michael Bay movies, such as The Island and The Rock were decent movies, while this one does not deserve a second viewing"

","Forget the haters and the critics for a moment. When you think of a sequel to the blockbuster ""Transformer"" from 2007, what are you really looking for? T2 delivers in every way.<br/><br/>Shia and Megan do adequately. They both have plenty of room to grow as actors, and I have no doubt they will succeed.<br/><br/>The humor from the first film is back, and if you don't appreciate it then that is your problem. The movie is hilarious.<br/><br/>The clincher though is the amazing action and special effects, as well as the standout performer: Optimus Prime. He is bad, as in bad to the bone, and is perhaps the greatest CGI character of all time.<br/><br/>I was able to see it on iMax, and it truly is one of the most cinematic experiences that I have ever had.<br/><br/>Thank you Michael Bay."

","The sad thing about this movie, is that it could have been so much better with just a few minor modifications, and I would have given it a much better rating.<br/><br/>*spoiler warning... just in case* <br/><br/>First off, the twins were not necessary. A movie such as this stands on its own without the campy humor. Their roles could have been minimized or even removed with little or no impact to the plot. These guys were no R2D2 and C3PO. As for the length of the film, it seemed to drag on a little at times. Two and a half hours is a little much, considering most of it was fight scenes. If I am going to have to sit through this much movie, I expect to see Ian McKellen and Viggo Mortensen in the credits.<br/><br/>And please Hollywood: more story, fewer cans of whoop-as*! What the heck! This movie seemed like one long series of robots ripping the guts out of other robots. Were this to have been humans fighting humans, this would have gotten an R rating. Even Optimus got into the act. This movie portrayed him as being unusually violent. Optimus is a wise leader, who defends his group at all costs. His ageless wisdom has taught me much through the years of my life, and I am disappointed in seeing him turned into a super-ninja-maniac robot. This time around I think the powers that be went overboard showing him ripping off heads, and punching through chests.<br/><br/>Lastly the humor left something to be desired. Repeatedly, the movie made explicit references to male genitalia. Potty humor is something I expect out of an Eddie Murphy movie, not the Transformers. Some of this type of humor always seems to slip into the movies nowadays. The last Transformers movie showed one of the Autobots ""leaking."" I thought that was unnecessary as well. Here is the rundown on potty humor: it is always good for an easy laugh. It is amateurish and unbecoming of a franchise with such a long legacy. Too much of this type of humor in a movie is a sign that the writer(s) have no ability to think up anything else.<br/><br/>Less violence, less potty humor, and a slightly shorter film would have saved this movie, which has a fairly good story to it. I have always loved the Transformers for its thought provoking lessons. Their stories have always taught me something when I watched them. This movie also contained a moral at the end. Sometimes we have to do what is right, even when it is inconvenient. This simple lesson got lost in the endless violence, and putrid humor. Perhaps Director Michael Bay should have followed this advice, and taken a slightly higher road."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","3","9","26 June 2009"," Mind-blowing, provided you don't pull the trigger first
","""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a horror movie for epileptics, a 2.5-hour exhibition of a hurricane in a hardware store, a relentlessly loud first movement in a symphony of destruction. It is a summer blockbuster on steroids: you'd like to laud the accomplishment, but it feels like cheating. In other words, ""Fallen"" appears to be the greatest spectacle of visual effects and stunts ever made, but simultaneously the most overproduced screaming pile of junk Hollywood has served us in this computer-generated era.<br/><br/>You have to give Michael Bay credit, the man sticks to his directorial convictions: explosions, chases and more explosions. Despite getting reamed for years for his overkill style, he seems to feel like it's not worth making a sequel unless you're committed to visually dwarfing the first one. What his approach, and the approach of this entire film should have been, was not to overload this thing and instead hit the audience hardest where it counts most. ""Fallen"" is more than overly ambitious: the script is a barreling mack truck and the audience like roadkill stuck in its grill.<br/><br/>""Fallen"" enlightens us that humans and transformers actually have a history on Earth, the only plausible way to harvest a story after a straight-forward, sensible and enjoyable first film. Two years later, the U.S. Military and the Autobots have joined forces to eliminate the surviving Decepticons that threaten Earth. After the opening scene ravishing China, however, it's not that simple. Our human hero, Sam Witwicky (LaBeouf), has discovered that a shard from the first film's All Spark, an energy source giving life to Transformers, has been with him all this time, and now it's suddenly transferred crucial information to him that contains the whereabouts of another energy source somewhere on Earth that could give the Decepticons their revenge. As with the first film, that's not all. Dozens of characters and subplots (Sam going to college, the Obama administration trying to shut down the operation between the Army and the Autobots and of course the sexiest woman alive, Megan Fox, trying to get her boyfriend to say three small words.<br/><br/>As for new Transformers, it seems as if Hasbro, creators of the hit action figures for decades now, put a mandatory quota on needing x number of new products appearing on screen for toy-mongering children to beg their parents for. ""Fallen"" is loaded with new bots, including the famous Devastator, a five-transformers-joined-into-one monstrosity that resembles a living junkyard and is even equipped with ""testicles."" <br/><br/>Yes, that's part of ""Fallen""'s obnoxious and horrific sense of humor. It was pretty even hit- or-miss in the first movie, but this film is even more insulting to its audiences comedic intelligence. Take ""the twins"" for example: idiotic gold-toothed stereotypes in the form of those compact Chevys (GM, how fitting) throwing insults at each other. They are second to only Jar Jar Binks. The writers also seem to think adding Sam's new college roommate is a good idea -- when John Turturro (also pointlessly back) stuns him to sleep to shut him up, it's almost as if they knew what an annoyance he was. It's hard to believe that at least Orci and Kurtzman, who delivered an awesome ""Star Trek"" script last month, were behind such frivolous dialogue. I can't fault them for the absurdity of the plot and lack of themes -- they were paid a lot and their hands were tied -- but the forced humor? Terrible.<br/><br/>Still, as easy as ""Fallen"" is to rip on, it gets a few stars out of respect for the man hours it must've taken to turn this film over in less than two years and make it as much of a visual masterpiece as it is. Though Bay could have made it less frenetic with not as many camera circle-arounds, you can tell every sequence had to have been planned so far ahead and done perfectly on every take. Let's hope the next one, Bay or no Bay, condenses quantity into quality and gives this franchise back its storytelling dignity. At the least, let Hollywood learn, in the peak of the CG era, that less is more. ~ Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site: http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
"hollywoodcruzer","4","3","9","26 June 2009"," Not that great
","Quite frankly this movie was not nearly as good as the first one. I should have known that would happen based on what Michael Bay did to ""Friday the 13th."" Anyways, the reasons I didn't enjoy this movie are because of the childish humour, too many Autobots and Decepticons, and Sam's stupid roommate. Do I need to see dogs humping in a $200 million dollar movie? No. Do I need to see Arcee, and 50 unnamed Decipticons that are not even essential to the plot? No. And the roommate was totally pointless.<br/><br/>They should have focused more on Optimus Prime and the Autobots from the first movie, as well as Sam and Mikaela. And, ""The Fallen"" made me question whether this character should be included, and all old school Transformers fans will agree with me that he is most definitely ""Innocent!!"" - that is not a good thing! And why couldn't Bumble Bee talk this time around? On the bright side, Shia, Megan, Peter Cullen and Hugo Weaving did a great job."
"gregeichelberger","4","3","9","26 June 2009"," 'Transformer' fans, lend me your ears - please
","In an effort to prove the chaos theory, or the adage that the more noise the better, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" Paramount's sequel to the wildly successful 2007 original is long in the tooth, but comes up short of the bar laid by its predecessor.<br/><br/>And while the first installment used comedy and humorous situations that tied in seamlessly with the story of a robotic civil war and the hapless humans caught in the crossfire, here the laughs are forced (a ""That 70s Show"" mom gets high on brownies, John Tuturro as a CIA man turned butcher, a pair of jive-cracking Jar Jar Binks-like Autobots - complete with gold teeth, etc.).<br/><br/>Then, as the Grinch would say, there's the ""noise, noise, noise."" Cranked up to 11 out of a possible 10 on the decibel level, every tick is ear-bleedingly apparent and causes me to label it, ""Indiana Jones and the Loud Crusade."" This is appropriate on several levels, too, as our hero, Sam (Shia LaBeouf), becomes an amateur archaeologist and symbologist in an effort to figure out the signs he sees in his head.<br/><br/>Evidently, the shape-shifting contraptions have been on earth since the Dawn of Man (or at least since the Dawn of Spear-Throwing Mixed Race Egyptian Man). When a piece of the shard (from the all-powerful cube of the first film) touches him, Sam's mind fills up with all of this ancient knowledge. Knowing this, the bad guys (Decepticons), led by The Fallen (voice of Tony Todd) and Megatron (Hugo Weaving) capture Sam, his girlfriend Mykaela (Megan Fox) and college roommate Leo Spitz (Ramon Rodriguez, who plays second comedy fiddle to Turturro, if that's conceivable), carting them to the Sahara Desert.<br/><br/>Tagging along on this fun-filled trip to Egypt is an elite squad of U.S. soldiers under the leadership of Maj. Josh Duhamel (""Transformers"") and Master Sgt. Tyrese Gibson (""Flight of the Phoenix""), their Autobot allies and, of course, mom and pop (Julie White and Kevin Dunn - who has made a living out of playing the disbelieving father in so many of these kinds of films, including ""Small Soldiers"").<br/><br/>There's transformer battles aplenty here in the hot desert sand when Sam's own vehicle, Bumble Bee, goes postal and even the embarrassing Steppinfetchit Brothers, Sideswipe and Mudflap, prove their mettle. There is also the introduction of another metal monster, Jet Fire (Mark Ryan), a Decepticon who switched sides years ago because -oh, who cares?! In addition, there's another subplot of Sam's attempts to save an injured Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons trying to uncover a machine that draws energy from the Sun (buried in a pyramid) or something like that. All of these stories make for quite a long running time (for an action movie) and come crashing together in an extremely noisy conclusion.<br/><br/>Director Michael Bay (who learned subtle film-making on the set of ""Pearl Harbor"") also employees a great deal of quick edit, jump cut, hand-held camera shots which assault the eyes as much as his sound effects attack the ears. And speaking of ears, did I hear bits of dialogue from ""Forrest Gump"" or was I just dreaming?!<br/><br/>So, if your ears can stand the machine gun rounds, motor shells, missiles, bomb drops, confusing robotic punch outs and you can take this for almost two-and-a-half hours, this is the perfect sequel. To be fair, the CGI effects are very good (even though many times I could not really tell which robot was doing what to whom), the 'bots are creative and some of the laughs are well solicited.<br/><br/>Overall, not a terrible summer blockbuster addition, but just enough of a diversion to get us to ""Public Enemies"" and beyond."
"CryptoGuy","4","3","9","26 June 2009"," A Poor Effort
","Michael Bay can shoot one heck of an action sequence. It is hard to beat his style when it comes to action. Nevertheless, I am convinced he cannot tell a story at all.<br/><br/>Though there were some exciting moments in the movie, it fell flat for me. It was all over the place. The characters were one dimensional and uninspired. The comic relief was too much. Finally, the film was insulting on so many levels.<br/><br/>(Insult #1) Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Transformers based on a Hasbro toy line. So, who are they marketing this film to? Not my kid! He's 10 and his mouth dropped when every four letter word save the ""F"" bomb was spewing out every character like water from a broken sewer line.<br/><br/>(Insult #2) The twins are an outrageous ghetto duo that even insulted me, a white man! Holy smokes, how they thought that these characters would fly, I don't know.<br/><br/>(Insult #3) Again, my 10 year old isn't interested in seeing rear ends of bombshell blonde's hanging out of there thin little dresses. He wants to see robots fighting other robots and soldiers fighting robots.<br/><br/>Final thought: a poor effort from a film maker with poor character as far as I'm concerned."
"gegobopictures","4","3","9","26 June 2009"," Transformers: Rise of the Machines?
","This was one of the summer movies I was looking forward to this year as I really enjoyed the first movie. Yes I am one of those people who grow up the 80's playing with transformers toys and watching the cartoons. Anyway so I sat down in the movie theater with my wife and film starts......... <br/><br/>The opening scene some joint special forces mission with the Autobots seeking out the stray Decepticons that remains on earth. This uneventful opening scene failed to get my blood pumping as I thought visually there was nothing new here. As I soon I saw the ice cream van Autobot I knew that it was going to be a very annoying character with a silly voice which has been put in the film to please the young audience. Guess what I was right, the ice cream van actually turned into two silly robots, they both talked in really awful street talk. Remember how bad Jar Jar Binks is Star Wars Episode 1 well this is the same but times two. I looked at my wife she was enjoying movie so I remained in my seat. <br/><br/>So I fast forward a little bit here and Sam goes to college. A very attractive young lady is taking a very keen interest in him and this is the point where I almost through my tub of Ben and Jerry's and the screen in disgust because........wait for it..........wait for it...........The attractive collage girl turns out to be a Decepticons a transformer that transformers into an attractive collage girl.....what the f***! Why didn't Hasbro think of this? Why because its a s*** concept that's why. Although I do remember seeing a film where a robot was disguised as an attractive woman. I believe it was called TERMINATOR - RISE OF THE MACHINES. This scene has to be up there with the invisible car that was in JAMES BOND - DIE ANOTHER DAY. Was there anything else that was unoriginal in the film well yes just about very other scene with was taking from the best bits from all other Michael bay films you see familiar scenes from Bad Boys, Pearl harbor and Armageddon . The Fallen a new Decepticon looks identical to a Bionicale (remember them the weird robot franchise from Lego). <br/><br/>What's good about this film............three things really:<br/><br/>1. Bumblebee has a lot of screen time and kicks a lot of ass in this movie so much so that who cares about bringing Optimas Prime back to life.<br/><br/>2. The final battle scene between the army & Autobots vs. Decepticons is quite thrilling (although you'll have to wait about 2 hours to see this.)<br/><br/>3. Megan Fox<br/><br/>To wrap this up Transformers: Rise of the Fallen is an unbalanced mess. It's a fusion of unoriginal ideas banded together with a simplistically long script. I was really looking to the movie but it ended up as a big disappointment. Remember Jurassic Park, yes? Remember the Jurassic park sequels, no? I can see this franchise going in the same direction. But hey the studios don't care what mess they have released as they are already seeing $$$$$$$$$$."
"joe-2766","10","3","9","25 June 2009"," Revenge of the Fallen is equally as good as the Dark Knight
","Most movies put the best scenes to the trailers to allure us into the theaters, this movie is the opposite, the best scenes are in the movie...<br/><br/>I went to see the preview in Taipei at the Ambassador theater, the biggest theater in Asia probably, to watch the movie on the 30 ft. tall, 50 ft. wide screen was a great thrill, man the movies was good! I think Harrison Ford would be a much happier man if the same amount of money was put into the Crystal Skull, good for Shia, bad for Harrison.<br/><br/>Interesting thing is that it appears the bad robots are higher tech, some of them got jet engines so they can fly like F22s, leopard like robots are agile, plus a very sexy female robot, the good robots only got wheels. Bad robots should have won, the good ones can win at the end because they got good hearts? The battle scenes looked real, I have never been to a battle field, but I think this is the closest we can get, I once felt I smelled the gun smoke! The pyramid is also real! I have been to Egypt, I was never able to get close enough to look at it as in this movie.<br/><br/>I think Revenge of the Fallen is equally as good as the Dark Knight, go see it!"

","First of all quick note to all directors out there and wanna be directors: LONG does NOT = GOOD<br/><br/>LONG only = GOOD when the whole film is interesting, a good example of this is LoTR.<br/><br/>This films has some nice stuff but is way to long with no real plot, i grew up on Transformers and this wasn't it - this was a few action sequences pasted together with a poor excuse of a plot, which then ends in less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>The whole film could have been done and dusted in 90minutes and im sure more people would have come out happier. The first real plot line takes maybe an hour to complete and to be honest is not that interesting. The 2nd another hour and then the end well like i said before 5 minutes.<br/><br/>My god OP kills the biggest baddest Decepticon in 10 seconds that 6/7 primes couldn't kill before?!?!?!? And with Megatron helping?!?!? Come on. At least look at the cartoons for some help. Not too sure what is happening with Mr Spielberg as everything he has touched recently has been of very poor quality."
"moviemanMA","2","3","9","24 June 2009"," My friend's name is Optimus Prime, what's yours?
","The highly anticipated Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has come out, and what a coming out it is. Bay delivers a 150 minute spectacle featuring a wide array of shiny cars, military vehicles, and of course, giant, transforming robots. Even though the film lasted two and half hours, I felt like my sensory receptors had been fried beyond repair.<br/><br/>The film picks up right where the last film left off. For those who haven't seen the first film, it is of some importance to see it prior to Revenge, but it is not completely necessary. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is off to college to try and lead a normal life. Mikaela (Megan Fox) stays behind and tries to maintain their long distant relationship. They might be ready for a normalcy, but they aren't quite out of the woods just yet.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Autobots have been working with the military to try and stop the Decepticon's from taking over the planet. Lead by Optimus Prime and Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel), the secret squadron stumbles upon a new plan to take over and could result in the destruction of the Autobots as well as the entire planet. The Autobots call for Sam's help once more, for he holds the key to Earth's safety and the destruction of the Decepticon armada. The answer has been imprinted onto his brain (don't worry how, it just was).<br/><br/>The following is a wild goose chase that spans the globe. When we're not watching giant robots destroy everything in sight, there are only a few things left to do. Bay has mastered the art of distraction. He uses his characters and settings to fill up the gaps in between the action scenes. Fox's character in particular has a number of shots that have nothing to do with the scene or even the entire film. We all remember her pose looking under the hood of Sam's car in the first film. Well, there are about a dozen or more of those here. Yes, Megan Fox is attractive, but we can see her in magazines and on the Internet if we want pictures like that. The movie should be restricted to what is most important.<br/><br/>Another distraction and time waster Bay uses are the car and military vehicle transitions. Whenever the transformers are driving around, it looks like a commercial for Chevy or GMC. All that is missing is a disclaimer on the bottom of the screen in regards to the low APR financing. These shots pale in comparison to the military shots. I know Bay has connections with just about ever branch of the armed services. He wants us to make sure we know it, too. He uses virtually every possible piece of hardware the military has to offer from ships to planes to tanks. There is even some water/hovercraft here. Why? Do we really need to show off what our country has? One or two might be okay, but we see a new one every time we change locations or start a new mission. It is a bit ridiculous.<br/><br/>These distractions aside, there is a glaring flaw with the film and it lies within the screenplay. The story is too strung out and goes on way longer than it should be. This film doesn't have to have the greatest of plot twists or things like that. It needs to take us from one robot fight to the next. Let's face it, Transformers is not about the humans being saved but about the giant robots who run around blowing each other up scene after scene after scene. In between those scenes needs to be decent filler, something the first film had. The in between scenes here are annoying, poorly written, and could be condensed.<br/><br/>With all of that against the movie, there is one major upside (that saves the movie) and it is the Transformers. They are big, loud, and full of energy. Here is an example of a film where slow motion is used positively. It's fun seeing Optimus Prime headlock and gut an enemy Decepticon. It's even more fun watching it in slow motion. What Bay accomplished in the first film was a sense that these fights were taking place in real locations with real people and environments interacting with the robots. He applies the same conditions here and on a much more epic scale.<br/><br/>So it's not a great movie. It's too long, too cheesy, and confused at times. What it does offer is some guaranteed entertainment that just might make up for the near eleven dollar ticket price. If you don't expect a masterpiece and are looking to see some giant, killer robots wreak havoc on the world, enjoy."
"skopjiivak","5","3","9","24 June 2009"," An awkward blend of action, comedy, and slow mo
","This movie is clearly aimed towards 10-25 year old kids (mostly boys) and if the goal of the movie was the hit its target audience then I guess it succeeded. However the movie is far from sci-fi greats such as Empire Strikes Back, Terminator 2, and Jurassic Park. Now its highly unfair to rate this movie to those but I want to make perfectly clear that most people outside the target zone will find this movie a bore.<br/><br/>At 2 and half hours long this movie could easily be cut down in length, and while watching it the viewer could pick out scenes that could be thrown out to do just that. The movie's constant random humor (from parents getting high to a giant robot having balls located in certain region) greatly takes away from a decent story and beautiful action scenes and computer visuals. I feel that if the movie would have removed those scenes I would be giving this a 7 or 8. But when a movie has not 1 but 2 jar jar binks in it, I struggle to give it a good rating.<br/><br/>As for the fun factor, if you're looking for time to kill, or are dying to see this movie, See it in theaters. The visuals wont hold up at home so find a day where your theater has discount days and see it then.<br/><br/>This movie is far from the best i've ever seen but its not the worst. If you're looking for an awkward blend of comedy and slow-mo, then try not to pay more than 8 dollars seeing this movie."

","First off, I loved the effects...i was mesmerized anytime a TF was on the screen. Major props to the guys at ILM.<br/><br/>My problem is and has always been with Bay and his brand of films. Now I fully understand why he does what he does, it's a tough task to create a film that generates $700+ mil that appeals to every demographic. However, in this and every one of his previous films he compromises on story.<br/><br/>He wastes too much time developing these useless human characters that add nothing to the story (i.e.: Sam's parents?), where the focus should be the TFs! I want to know more about the TF's background, I want to know more about Ironhide, Ratchet, and the rest - not about some loopy 50 year olds.<br/><br/>I also thought the gratuitous use of 'sex' to 'sell' is ridiculous. I'm a guy, but if i want to see sexy girls I watch a porno - i paid to see giant robots saving the earth.<br/><br/>There are also a lot of little things that annoyed me and just didn't make any sense. Like the Jetfire character, i was completely disappointed as he was my very first TF toy as a kid. Why would a robot age like a human - hunch over, need a cane, have bad memory, etc? Does that make any sense to anyone? Wouldn't a robot, a machine, function like he did 1000yrs before? Enough rant. I'm a hard-core TF fan and enjoy a great story. Bay at the helm of this franchise is just very disappointing for me. I just wish that they found a director who understands how to create a financially successful film that appeals to the masses, but weaves together a compelling story that makes sense. A film Where everything has a purpose and nothing is gratuitous. We really needed a Chris Nolan, JJ Abrams, or Peter Jackson on this one. I think even Jon Favreau would've done a great job.<br/><br/>Regardless, I think this movie will be well received by the general public - I mean my 7 yr old loved it."
"rudy-altergott","5","3","9","24 June 2009"," FUN.... But overwhelming.
","In a nutshell, this was a great popcorn film, which is ultimately what it's meant to be. There are moments where you find yourself having a plethora of different emotions, probably because the cinematography makes it seem like its real. But there is SO much going on that it's almost too much stimuli for a single person to comprehend.<br/><br/>Too me, it was practically a rampage of destruction and cussing and sex and even more destruction. I can't even begin to imagine the combined damage costs caused by this movie, not to mention the damage to historic archaeological structures. And the loss of civilian and military life is staggering.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie, nonetheless, because of the complex lovable and hateful characters. I also recommend it because of the story, which, though slightly warped and jam-packed, will blow you away, because of the visual effects and finally because of what the film represents: the capacity of the human and non-biological extraterrestrial species to endure. <br/><br/>This will no doubt be one of the top blockbusters of Summer 2009, and one of those films you have to say you at least saw, whether you like or not. It's up to you to decide. <br/><br/>Autobots, roll out."

","All movies and going to be liked and disliked depending on the person. Take any movie you have saw and i can almost be sure that one of your friends didn't like it. Saying that if you don't agree with my opinion then we can just agree to disagree. I do think Transformers will be a huge hit in the money sack and it will be a huge grossing movie probably even taking out The Dark Knight.<br/><br/>Personality, my own opinion. My thought about Transformers 2 was it was stupid. 5/10 for me. It didn't get me going like the first one did and the story sucked and how the events played out didn't even be half as interesting as the first. The humor sucked and i didn't even get a chuckle. It's like Bay didn't know if he wanted to make the movie a comedy or an action, so he decided to do ""teen comedy"" and half ass the action. If i wanted to laugh at some ""teen humor"" i would have watched The hangover again and laugh my ass off. I wanted to see some transformers not some sub college storyline. The story was to slow pace for me and i almost ended up falling asleep. (probably not from the movie but from me only having three hours of sleep.) Overall, i didn't like it but that doesn't mean other people will. The midnight crowd i was with absolutely loved this movie and gave it a standing ovation to close it out. When i was walking out the theater, i could hear other people telling their friends that ""it was the best movie ever"" and things like ""Nothing can top this."" So if i can leave you with one thought about this is that go watch it and make up your own mind about the movie. Love it or hate it, definitely Transformers 2 is going to make some M-O-N-E-Y"
"mattwaterhouse","4","3","9","24 June 2009"," Disappointing
","I liked the first Transformers movie. A lot. I saw it four times at the cinema. It tapped into something inside me, the child that used to play with the action figures, and brought the way that felt right out. Revenge Of The Fallen was good, maybe not as good as the first film, but still well worth seeing on the big screen.<br/><br/>The Autobots are now working with the two soldiers from the first film (Josh Dushamel and Tyrese Gibson) in a covert alliance to fight the Decepticons, whilst protecting the general public from knowledge of the robots' existence. Needless to say, giant robots are kinda conspicuous, and on a mission in Shanghai they screw up and a Decepticon is set loose. It's final words: The Fallen will rise again.... Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia Laboef) is going to college and has to leave Bumblebee behind. As he is leaving, he touches part of the Allspark (from the first film) and begins to have visions and write down symbols leading to a source of Energon, which puts the Decepticons hot on his trail.<br/><br/>What I love about this movie is the fighting between the robots. They are much more epic than they were in the first film, and the audience can actually see whats going on. The effects overall seem more polished and clearer, and the Transformers themselves look like they fit into the scenery. We also get to see another world, which looks very nice. With the exception of Star Trek, these are some of the best special effects I have seen this year.<br/><br/>Story-wise, its a little too convoluted. The films comes out at around two and a half hours long, and my god I started to feel it after around one and a half. There are a lot of clever elements, the concept of The Fallen was very good, and the relationships between characters seem a lot better. For example, Megatron and Starscream have a much more venomous relationship with each other than in the first film, which works really well. The human characters are pretty much the same as they were in the first movie, not really that deep, but not blank or vacuous either. The movie has a little bit less heart than the first, the only time I really cared about the characters were when Sam and Bumblebee were on screen together. The Transformers themselves had a degree of charm, but I wasn't feeling it as much as the first movie.<br/><br/>This was written by the same guys who did Star Trek, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, and its really nowhere near as good. Its got a lot of the charm and action it needs but it really overdid the humour. There are way too many jokes, and around 70% of them are really not funny. The film also falls really flat about halfway through. This is not as disappointing as Terminator Salvation by far, but not as mindblowing as Star Trek is. I'd give it a 6 out of 10."
"comicbkgirl","6","3","9","24 June 2009"," It is okay, not what I wanted though...*SPOILERS*
","I am just going to start off by saying that Transformers Rise of the Fallen was an okay movie. It had plenty of action sequences, girls in skimpy outfits, and cliché dialogue. I only have a few comments. MAJOR SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Apparently the Transformers are magicians. They can disappear and reappear at anytime. This bothered me. Optimus is getting his butt kicked and all I could think of waswhere'd Bumblebee go? Then there is a sequence where the Twins are fighting Devastator and they appear to win, but then disappear. Arcee is pretty much non-existent and Wheelie is just there for comic relief and he too just suddenly disappears. It bothered me that the writers didn't look at each other's pieces and find some continuity. It felt as though they were thinking, ""oh this is a good spot to throw Bumblebee back in."" This is most apparently when Bumblebee doesn't stick around to help the twins with the Constructicons and follows Sam. If he wasn't going to fight, why didn't he drive Sam to Optimus? Is he that cruel? Bay could have thought of a better way to create tension without pulling the disappearing act. Also, I could have sworn Ironhide found Sam before then he acts all surprised when he sees them. I became so confused over which robot was where that I just gave up. At least the Corvette looked cool. <br/><br/>I also could not stand the fact that this is marketed to not only teens but also older children. I know plenty of sixth graders who would love to go see this, but with all the gratuitous sexual content, even I felt a little embarrassed. Did they really have to give a Transformer balls? Really? I would much rather see an Autobot conversation than some random Megan Fox boob shot that has nothing to do with the movie. (though I am not too upset that they included them, let's face it they only reason she is in the movie is for T&A) It seemed that they were too interested in giving poorly planned sex and drug jokes than actually telling a coherent story. <br/><br/>Also, what was up with the parents? Judy became so annoying at one point I wanted one of the Decepticons to just shoot her in the head. There was no reason for the parents to be there, they just filled in some cheesy dialogue, which by the way, was used in War of the Worlds (you have to let me go dad!). So to me there are two categories: Pros: Nice transformations, sweet cars, good action sequences, and good research on history. Cons: Forced jokes, no continuity, rushed, too much going on, bad dialogue (I LOVE YOU SAM! I NEED YOU!), not enough development of new Autobot characters, and unnecessary ball shots. <br/><br/>I know people have been picking out things and I am no expert. All I know is that I wanted to see a sequel that matched my enjoyment of the original. I think that Michael Bay was given too much money and gave very little direction. Movies are more than just bombs and boobs. I am almost glad that he is not doing a third one. Maybe they can get a director who can keep track of plot not just explosions."
"ravenarkaos","5","3","9","23 June 2009"," Really a Summer blockbuster
","OK, so You want explosions, transformations, sexiness and a lot of almost absurd humor? Combine that with a lot more focus on the Transformers, both Autobots and Decepticons, their history etc, a lot more war sequences and there You have it. Mr. Bay(hem) once again crossed the line drawn by himself with his earlier productions, and gave us a real blockbuster of a movie, a perfect way to spend a Summer evening. Although there are some flaws (too much humor in my opinion, too many Decepticons, it makes them almost anonymous and a little hard-to-believe plot)it is a wonderful film and even if for some people it won't be better than the first one, it sure is AT LEAST as entertaining and awesome as his predecessor. <br/><br/>Hurry up and see it as soon as possible!"

","When I see that Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen has received so many negative comments I think why? What did I see in this film that no-one else didn't? Now I could refer to the cold references to cinematography, script, acting whatever but that takes away the magic that films have and so I have decided to ignore such reviews (at least ones that are just rude and insulting) and share why I loved it. An article in Total Film magazine summed it up really; Transformers 2 is bigger from title; to plot; to action; from start to finish this film is massive but it pays big dividends because of it. The plot may be confusing to some but this was never supposed to be a film about intelligent plots or outstanding acting and drama, no this is a science fiction action movie which is meant to be pure fun and that is what it is. No film this year,except maybe Star Trek, has kept me on the edge of my seat with excitement as this film did, the special effects are perfect, the robots are stunning as are the set pieces; an Optimus Prime versus 3 Decepticons in a wooded area steals the show here. There are more Autobots, there are more Decepticons (including a really cool Soundwave) and there are more comic relief characters with some old faces returning. The comic relief may annoy some who may not have a high tolerance for such things but otherwise this is the best film of the year so far."

You guys just didn't get it. And why would you when you never watched the original cartoon. Michael Bay did a great job. he did not copy the story of the cartoon completely. but he used the plot in the cartoon to make something different.<br/><br/>I am a transformers fan. and I have watched their cartoons and the cartoon movie. they were awesome. and this movie gave me all that i have wanted. a lot of action.<br/><br/>One Shall stand and one shall fall!!!"

Megan Fox was as gorgeous as ever and the film as a whole pulled through and provided an extremely entertaining watch.<br/><br/>The only negatives i got for this film is that the film was a little too long winded and there was a few too many comedy scenes for my liking. The film could have done without the weird robots and the parents. <br/><br/>Overall its a MUST SEE for any open minded person who's not going to criticise it for being unrealistic. 10/10"
"markyd1979","4","3","9","22 June 2009"," Great action, poor film overall..........
","Now let me get this straight. I am 29 and when i was a kid i was the BIGGEST Transformers fan IN THE WORLD!!! Had all the toys, loved the cartoon, cried when Prime died in the animated movie, etc. So you can imagine my excitement when the first live action Transformers film came out. And..... i loved it! I thought the plot involving the 'All Spark' was quite poor but not enough to spoil the actual film. I thought the rest of it apart from that was superb! So, i was really looking forward to Revenge Of The Fallen. Unfortunately after watching it twice in two days (took my Dad on father's day as well as my first screening with friends) I was highly unimpressed! Don't get me wrong.... the special effects are some of the best you will see until probably the third instalment! A lot of shaky camera work which with the detail on the robots can make for blurry confused viewing for some people (look at the final battle in LA at the end of the first film! 'MY EYES HURT!' material), fortunately Egypt for the final battle was picked because it was more plain and less confusing which was a good move. Things are a lot clearer to see. But, as a film as a whole..... well..... its just poor. There are hit and miss moments of humour (mostly from Sam's parents), there is literally zero plot, the small bit of plot there is just craps on the original story lines from the TV series where it all started. Now that may be me being a transformers geek, but even if i wasn't a fan, i would still find the story pretty lame on a whole! There is no character development for all the new characters (except the two VERY annoying twins!). It just all kinda feels a bit disjointed and rushed. Basically it boils down to this..... Michael Bay likes to blow sh*t up! He spends the best part of 2 and a half hours doing it! It looks good when he does! But unfortunately, it takes a bit more than that to make a decent film and keep people interested for that length of time. If your the type of person who loves to see sh*t being blown up for extended periods of time then this is the film for you! If your a long time Transformers fan prepare to be disappointed.... If your neither of these, switch brain to off before you go and you might have fun!"

","Well, I went to watch this but somehow knew it won't live up to the first one. I don't want to sound negative, so I will try my best to explain why I am saying this.<br/><br/>The first instalment was great, I gave it only 9/10, the reason for that was the last scene, was too much for me to process. So, if you disagree with me then you are so lucky, why? because the 2nd instalment is basically the the last 40mins of the first extended over +2hr, so you might say you found your gold mine. The movie since the first sec was full of action, endless fighting scenes. The humour factor was great I must admit. The cinematography was bad :( I couldn't understand what is going on in almost all the tense scenes. Another problem is the site, I remember in the first one the director took us to Qatar and in this one to another country (won't say) but you will see that the two sites look alike, so wasn't really impressed. And it seemed that the director got confused because the site preparation showed that country like 150years ago not in this century lol. Michael be careful next time. <br/><br/>So, all in all the movie was good but not good enough so I gave it 6/10"

And am I the only person who actually watched the original transformers series? Or the 1987 cartoon movie? It was PACKED with stupid scenes and bad dialogue! There was even a scene where a Weird Al song called ""dare to be stupid"" played and all the transformers broke out into a huge dance number! No my friends, this movie is loaded with action and humour. The only problem with it is that people immediately hate it because Michael Bay is at the helm. People were lining up to trash the first movie but guess what, to everyone's surprise it was actually good! This film is no different. The first movie developed the characters which leaves more room for action in this film. But due to the simple fact that people couldn't trash the first film because it was actually good, which meant it was open season on this film no matter what the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>So yes, I am a Michael Bay fan, I love The Rock, enjoy both Bad Boys, always get a kick out of Armageddon, and so on.

","First off I'm going to get this out of the way. This is not the worst movie of 2009, not by a long shot, that's reserved for Grace. No the big problem I see with Transformers 2 is the pacing. The movie feels to long. As with all Bay movies he tends to overindulge in cool camera movements that make a scene to long, that doesn't need to be that long. If you shaved down the scenes in question I would say you'd get a pretty good 2 hour flix here. As is I enjoyed it, but you can pretty much put your brain on auto-pilot. The actors are just there for eye-candy and the robots...well they're well done. There are parts of this Transformers I like a lot better than the first, but the first climax is way better. The opening in China is a fantastic fight, and one of my beefs, not enough sideswipe or the other good auto-bots. To much decepticon action. Another stand-out sequence is when Optimus Prime is attacked by Megatron, Starscream and Grindor. It's about time we see Optimus kick some major butt. That scene was worth the watch. The next being the Constructicons forming into Devastator, that was one mean SFX. All in all there are better popcorn movies, but if you love explosions then this movie will go down easy like the fake butter used in said theaters."
"RafiSteinger","1","4","14","1 July 2012"," Michael Bay Should Be Ashamed
","The reason most sequels fall short is because they rely solely on the material in the first movie. The first Transformers movie had all the makings of a good action movie; action, a decent enough plot, suspense, and a good climactic action sequence. Revenge of the Fallen dragged on and focused a lot on the quick laughs and cheap gimmicks that sell tickets and moved away from a story line that could have made the movie much more interesting. In all, this movie exercised ""salesmanship"" rather than effort (""Salesmanship"" being a practice in trying to sell something sub- par rather than focus on making a good product).

Autobots speak jive (''yo, yo, wazzup, byatch?!?!''), Turturro shows his old-mans-ass, Megan Fox never closes her mouth throughout the film, robots fart (which is supposed to be funny, but it's not), Megatron is a comedy sidekick, Egyptians are dumb clichés, soldiers are firing with machine guns and pistols at GIANT ROBOTS, good guys can teleport themselves around the world but can't teleport the bad guy onto the surface of the sun or in a volcano or whatever, and so on...<br/><br/>Avoid at all cost.

I am not sentimental, maybe I think that G1 cartoons are the best original series and they have quality. I don' want to rant here, I ranted enough in the review of the first film. What to expect from Bay, explosions, funny camera angles, shallow characters and performances, US military... America f**k yeah... and all of that crap, the entire film looks like every other Bay film, a giant commercial. Bay didn't want to make a stupid toy movie. But, he didn't make a toy film, just a stupid film. Now, this time, autobots are taking care of the remaining scum of decepticons on earth, but they soon found out that Megatron is alive and he wants Sam (It's Spike! Spike!) because Sam, accidentally memorized a code that is of great interests of The Fallen (voiced by great Tony Todd, best known as Candyman), one of the last primes in the universe. Because, by the stories, transformers were earlier on earth and turned humans in their slaves to build pyramids and all that crap, what a dumb cliché story... someone watched AVP too much I think? Nothing to say about Bay, he was in his own element.<br/><br/>Actors... well Shia (irritating, but not bad), Megan (hot as always), Tyrese and Duhamel (nothing special, they were there just to show that they will fight side by side with autobots, America f**k yeah!) Kevin Dunn and Julie White (nothing, just a silly comic relief), we have some new characters: Leo Spitz (Sam's roommate from college), he was there also as a comic relief. I don't understand, why using too much comic relief? Isn't one actor enough for that? Isabel Lucas? She was there to be hot... It's incredible how Bay uses actor only because of their looks and type... that's insulting.<br/><br/>Robots... well no change here... they looked good outside, but inside... retards without any personality. Optimus was only good. While some important robots like Bumblebee and Megatron are missed and neglected. I am glad that Starscream got a little more screen time, I think that Charles Adler is great as Starscream. We also have some new robots... like Arcee for example, Wheelie and Skids, two impossible, retarded, boring robots... and wanted them dead. Soundwave was there, he was OK, and thanks to Frank Welker, he was even better, we also have Sideswipe and Devastator... Devastator looks very funny, ridiculous to be exact, we could see Devastator's anus, his anus, his anus, his... ANUS! Bay really made fun of these robots, we also had a scene in the first film, where Bumblebee is ""lubricating"" on John Turturro. So, if that is for entertainment purposes, i really don't know...

","I still remember sitting in the theater trying so hard not to fall asleep while watching this garbage. It isn't the worst film that has been made or could be made but it certainly isn't good. It was just a sloppy thrown together mess that lacks the heart, emotion, or fun plot of the first film. The first Transformers movie was a perfect example of an excellent film while ""Revenge of the Fallen"" is a perfect example of a bad film.<br/><br/>My two major complaints are this: 1) The Transformers were very undeveloped. It was just a bunch of huge machines thrown together smashing each other's block off. The action was just sloppy. Things were being thrown around and there were huge explosions for absolutely no reason. It was almost impossible to even see what is going on during all of the explosions and action. Since the characters were not developed I did not feel any connections with them besides the main characters(Shia Labouf, Megan Fox, Optimus Prime, and Bumblebee). So my point is that it was just a bunch of giant metal men that we did not care about beating the crap out of each other for what seemed like hours.<br/><br/>2) The film did not have the heart that the first one had. The first film had everything from action, a good plot, mystery, sci-fi elements, romance, car/race/chase scenes, adventure, great acting, and a feeling of dedication and heart that radiated from the film. This film had hardly any plot at all and definitely no heart. Nothing in this film worked.<br/><br/>So in conclusion this film felt sloppy and an excuse to make a lot of money and have big explosions. Stay as far away from it as possible."

","There are only 2 major things to say about this 'movie'.<br/><br/>As in the first movie, stunning visual effects (only the SFX crew should had been paid, oh and there's also more than fine music; you'll even laugh-with-tears at how monumental the music becomes and how poorly the actors perform in those should-had-been-elevating moments).<br/><br/>And you also get to learn that Michael Bay & the writers are sexually obsessed.<br/><br/>The movie is about 2 hrs and a half long, and THERE ARE NO TEN CONSECUTIVE MINUTES in this movie without some sort of sexual innuendos or straight-on depictions (and some, the worst, were not even between humans, but between dogs, and alien mini-bot and human girl).<br/><br/>Especially when it's a movie hard to keep away from children, this shouldn't be ignored.<br/><br/>So let's, for once, not ignore it. Enlarging the scale you consider these things, you strangely find out that in most parts of the world (actually just about everywhere except North America and Western Europe and perhaps Australia & NZ) the word 'stalker', for example, doesn't even exist (any translator would have hard time trying to explain that word to a local). I suppose, only the stalkers (and the sexual serial killers) would be enough to show, somewhat consistently, that the American type of early-learning sexual education have failed. OK, they learn how to do it (guess what: the humans have multiplied themselves long before the American education), then they learn to do it safely, but they also become obsessed. Think, for example, of all the super- close shots of sexual organs in a porn movie. That's not erotic, that's sick. If you stick your eyes into your girlfriend's butt or sex, you are sick.<br/><br/>Bay & Co. had also some sick stuff in the first 'Transformers' movie, but the ones here are simply inadmissible. Again, don't forget that this is a movie children are interested in most.<br/><br/>Now, I lived 23 years under dictatorship, so I'm among the first ones to tell you that that's bad (putting it VERY mildly). But a good side (perhaps the only one) indeed was there: sick (and contagious) people like Michael Bay were never left at large.<br/><br/>So, enjoy your popcorn. Meanwhile, I had to explain my 12 years old kid why he can't see this movie (I first watch all movies he's interested in; have to do that, in this post-modern world - read: post-any-values world). And I can't explain. And he hates me.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was at least as good as Iron Man or Batman, and it was way better than either Hulk movie, the latest Superman movie or the first two X-men sequels. It is not going to be a classic like Dune or 2001, but then how many movies are? All the negative reviews are obviously the work of sci-fi haters."

","I can't believe this movie. The action was cool, but the plot was completely idiotic. And what's up with the goofy star wars reference. (Picture Darth Vader bowing to the Emperor in Empire strikes back/Megatron bowing like a pathetic loser to the Fallen). <br/><br/>The depiction of the robot twins was just plain racist, and the language was horrific. With just a few minor changes, this movie would have been excellent, but as is, it just fails.<br/><br/>I realize that this is an action movie, and plot was probably not the first thing on Michael Bay's mind, but come on, at least some continuity would have been good. As far as the humor goes, it just seemed like they were trying way too hard, and the attempt came across as completely sophomoric. Despite everything, the movie was entertaining, and I enjoyed it to some degree, however, I am truly disappointed."

","Yes, we all love to bash Michael Bay. But perhaps there's a reason for that...THE MAN MAKES CRAPPY MOVIES!!<br/><br/>And this is a prime example of his screwed up mind crapping out an abomination to please the idiotic masses of the world. Listen...I'm not a film snob. I enjoy explosions as much as the next man, but this is ridiculous. Do people who clap when the gold-toothed, simian-faced robot, speaks ""ghetto"" not realize how insulting it is? I mean, is this the level of audiences today? Must be, because how else can this movie make record-breaking numbers at the box office?<br/><br/>I'm serious here...What the hell is wrong with you, people? Okay, the VFX are great. Now that we have that out of the way...<br/><br/>The plot. Okay, seriously, someone playing with Transformer toys at home could probably come up with something better. The acting. Yes, give Megan Fox the Oscar. The characters. I get it that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but when such caricatures are put in dramatic situations...you just can't give a crap. Just kill them all, please, starting with the mother. The action. Well, it's not as ADD as the first one, but there's no real excitement. It's a few big, gray blobs of metal, hitting each other. Hooray!<br/><br/>And why the hell is this crap 2 and a half hours long? Why is the college part of the film even there? Why are the parents there? Why is the roommate there? If you're gonna make a piece of crap, at least make a short piece of crap."
"thedrq","4","3","10","24 June 2009"," Far, Far, Far from perfect, but not complete crap
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a strange movie. Not strange as in the sense of say, ""Clockwork Orange"", but in the sense that it's a combination of awesome sci-fi epic and total mess. The action, the special effects, the cgi, are without a doubt top notch (more on that in a bit), but something just didn't feel right.....and i can tell you what.<br/><br/>This go around, in what will probably become an endless franchise, we get brand new characters.....possibly TOO many new characters. A good 20% of them go nameless. Even one who has a couple of lines and some great battle sequences isn't named until 10 minutes before the end. I jump to the end for a reason; in true Micheal Bay fashion, he has no idea how to end a movie. Everything we see in the forty plus minute final battle is without question unforgettable, but seriously Mr. Bay, please get to the point..... Another main problem is the humor. I feel that since the first movie ended up being funnier than expected, they felt the need to make us laugh, and sadly went mostly juvenile. This isn't to say there are not any laughs, in fact there is a great number of them, but also a large share of groans too. The plot is much darker than the first, so there really wasn't much room for the laughs, and this should have been the series' ""Empire Strikes Back"".<br/><br/>I have now brought us to the plot. Seeing as how Transformers in general doesn't need much of a plot to begin with, and the first movie was close to sans plot, this one is much more fleshed out (if you will). However, going into detail of the plot would kill a lot of the story's development. I will say that it's clear the production staff listened to die-hard fans and incorporated all that they could, even involving fan-favorite characters and the much missed ""Matrix of Leadership"".<br/><br/>The writing left something to be desired, unfortunately. It almost feels like for the last third of the film that the script was abandoned, or the writers were fired half-way through and the cast and director just made it up as they went along. Again, like i mentioned about the humor, this does NOT mean it is a total bust.<br/><br/>By now I'm sure you think I'm saying skip this movie, I am not. I only wanted to get the faults out of the way. Overall, ""Revenge"" will stay in your thoughts for quite some time and will not be forgotten easily. I can't say it's on par with it's predecessor, but is chock-full of so many mind-blowing eye-carnage that it would a waste be a of your time to blink. If The Transformer universe is just not your cup of tea, or your not to caring of amazing FX, skip this movie. However, if you wish to see some of the best action sequences to be rendered in quite some time, while still being entertained, go give this one a look.<br/><br/>three out of four --That's my opinion, I'm Chris Peed"
"lastridge","5","3","10","23 June 2009"," Less Than Meets the Eye
","Let me start by saying I was a childhood Transformers fan – the target audience of this film. Let me follow-up by saying I was once again, overall disappointed with the film adaption of the popular cartoon series. Let me conclude by listing WHY:<br/><br/>1) The script was once again, appalling:<br/><br/>As a fan of a small handful of Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer films, you know what to expect when walking into one. A good script is not one of them, but Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen seemed particularly awful. While the general direction of the film was an improvement over the original film, the dialogue itself was frequently worse. Expect to cringe, groan, and perhaps contemplate why you're watching it.<br/><br/>2) The action scenes are flawed:<br/><br/>Admittedly, the action scenes are impressive, which is what you'd expect from a Michael Bay film. But as the camera often cropped-in too close to the robot, it would have been nice to occasionally ""see"" what was happening. Besides that, there's so many bits of metal being blurred radically across the screen, it's difficult to make out who's successfully hitting who. This could have easily been avoided if we didn't have to watch an Autobot transform while the camera is zoomed-in on it's nipple.<br/><br/>3) The romance was just wrong:<br/><br/>Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), leaves his now-girlfriend, Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) to go to college (and we should point out that if they didn't call it ""college"" in the film, we'd have presumed it was a world cheerleader convention, as average-looking women are apparently banned from the lecture rooms). In the moments Sam and Mikaela are together, they try to make the other say ""I love you"" first. Call me jealous, but it was difficult to believe that someone like Megan Fox – who looked as stunning as ever in the film – would have any trouble making her boyfriend say ""I love you"" every ten seconds of the day. But by the end of the film, she concedes. Of course she does. <br/><br/>4) The humor is very, very unfunny:<br/><br/>Transformers is clearly not meant to be a comedy, but oh how they tried! Every scene attempted one or two laughs - from humping dogs to a trash-talking mom. In most cases the cringe-worthy jokes would test your patience. In other cases, it just felt like a test of your IQ. <br/><br/>5) There are two Autobots:<br/><br/>One of the best things about the Transformers franchise is that everyone has their favorite Transformer. My personal favorites are Jazz and Sideswipe, major characters in the series but non-existent in this movie. So unless your favorite is Optimus Prime or Bumblebee, you will be disappointed. Ironhide (meant to be a red minivan) and Acree (female motorcycle) have one line each, so I guess they got lucky. <br/><br/>6) Thank god for the Americans:<br/><br/>When the evil Decepticons overwhelm the Autobots/US Marines-tandem in Egypt, the Jordanian Army comes to the rescue. Maybe it was too good to be true, but their army – consisting of two helicopters – get shot down within 10 seconds of appearing. Thank god more American reinforcements were suddenly nearby Egypt to balance the fight...(!)<br/><br/>7) Soundwave doesn't have ""the voice"":<br/><br/>Those who know Transformers would remember Soundwave – the Decepticon who's voice sounded like James Earl Jones after swallowing a light-saber, and transformed into an 80's tape cassette deck. The film version of Soundwave sounded like every other Transformer, and humped a Satellite the whole time. Lame! Where's the personality?<br/><br/>8) By the end, some journalists applauded:<br/><br/>I fear that when it is all said and done, some journalists are going say this was a good film. It is not. Fun? Yes. Entertaining? Yes. Good? No. The best way to work it out is this: If you take out the multi-million-dollar special effects (aka; the wrapping paper which makes it look pretty), you get the raw essentials. If you grade this film on it's raw essentials – you'd see it for what it is.<br/><br/>At least Megan Fox was hot."

","After a serious situation in Shanghai between the Decepticons, the Autobots and human, the North American president decides to blame the defensors of Earth leaded by Optimus Prime for the incident. Meanwhile, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) moves to the college campus and leaves one piece of the cube with his girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox). However, Sam has touched the small metallic piece and has acquired the ancient knowledge that interests to the Decepticons that want to retrieve it through the brain of Sam. Bumblebee and Optimus Prime protect Sam, but when Optimus Prime is destroyed, the life of Sam seems to be in danger.<br/><br/>""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a typical action movie for fans of Computer-Generated Imagery (CGI), with lots of explosions, car chase and special effects that does not need acting. In addition, the movie shows two sexy women (Isabel Lucas and Megan Fox) and stupid characters supposed to be funny, like July White in the role of the mother of Sam, but indeed an annoying character. The sequence in the campus of the university is one of the most ridiculous that I have ever seen. It is funny to see the North American President taking decisions in the name of the human race (where is UN?) and probably this is the best joke of this brainless movie. This time, the World Heritage Site destroyed by the truculence is located in Egypt. I am usually very generous in my rating and my vote is six.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Transformers: A Vingança dos Derrotados"" (""Transformers: The Revenge of the Defeated"")"

","Most of the time, if I see a bad movie, I don't need to spend time afterwards scrubbing it from my consciousness. But I did with ""Revenge of the Fallen"", which is the whole reason for the ""1"" rating; not one that I've ever given out before. But I don't ever want to sit through this again.<br/><br/>It's the same hideous bot designs as last time, same dizzying camera movements and ugly palette, just more of all of those for the sake of a bigger sequel. But I've never seen a movie this bad. LaBeouf is more spastic than ever and the story is needlessly convoluted for a giant robots movie. I didn't have any fun with this; it's loud, incoherent and Michael Bay's rocking the shaky cam. Seriously? Up until now, his brand has been tolerable - not all that enjoyable, but tolerable. But here, it's just awful. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not pretending the Transformers is something bigger than it is. It isn't. But everything that was wrong with the first movie is exacerbated here: characters and a story that are really badly drawn, horrible CGI (be honest: those robots are hideous) and action that's no fun to look at. Except this time, there's a broad attempt at ""humor"", be it racist or scrotal. And were the vulgar comedy actually funny, there wouldn't be a problem! No problem at all. If that's not bad enough, it's 150 minutes long. It's merciless! At a certain point, the stupid becomes suffocating. So yeah, it's a rating befitting a movie I want to forget. A shameless exercise in making Summer fare painful, and escapism shouldn't be an endurance test. <br/><br/>Eff this movie.<br/><br/>1/10"
"n8325250528","1","3","11","8 May 2011"," why does this review contain a spoiler?
","my review contains a spoiler, the spoiler is this movie is diarrhea. diarrhea mixed with vomit, cockroaches, aids infected blood, puss, and tears. Michael bay is worse than Hitler for making this Cass pool that is transformers 2. if i took some film and used it to wipe my ass, and then played it on a projector, that film wouldn't be as shitty as transformers: revenge of the fallen. when i started to watch this movie, i thought ""the first live action transformers was bad, but maybe this is different. after all, spider man 2, x-men 2, and iron man 2 were better than their firsts, who lets have an open mind. my open kind had liquid feces sprayed on it."
"gav_mcf","4","3","11","16 October 2010"," Still fast and exiting but instead of correcting the flaws of the first film, Bay amplifies them.
","Despite not being sure about the idea at first I was very impressed with the first Transformers, for me it was the surprise of 2007. The mixture of humour, action and special effects was spot on as well as making a star out of newcomer Shia LaBeouf. With Revenge of the Fallen, it's not a complete loss but it treads awfully close to being an absolute disaster.<br/><br/>Any problems that may have been slightly apparent in the first one, director Michael Bay just seems to have taken them and made them so much worse, within the opening 20 minutes a major one is apparent: the comedy. With Transformers the whole family dynamics element was amusing because it was light and believable, here it is just taken too far, especially with Sam's mother who is just so over the top, the most cringe worthy part is where she's running around Sam's college like an idiot, I couldn't wait for the scene to end.<br/><br/>I'd also like to ask Bay why Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) are so underused, they were important characters in the first film and with the part they have here they might as well have been written out. I'm sure plenty has been said already about the Transformer 'twins' so I won't go into it much except they are a complete disaster and are almost what Jar-Jar Binks was to The Phantom Menace. It's probably not too much of a spoiler to say, but in another act of madness there is a 'human' Decepticon, this is the worst thing Bay could've done because not only does this defy the whole point of the series it also begs the question: if they can transform into humans then whats the point in prating about with cars, planes etc. if they want to infiltrate a military base or something? In a more positive note the action sequences on the whole are very good with the special effects perhaps being even better than the first one. The opening in Tokyo is fantastic as well as a fight with Optimus Prime going hell for leather in a forest. The desert finale is not bad, but perhaps like the ending of the first it suffers from being a bit repetitive and how many times do we need to see LaBeouf and Fox running in slow motion! It was also completely pointless Sam's parents being involved, they should only be in the film as comic relief and it was overstuffed as it was.<br/><br/>On the performances, Shia LaBeouf (who surely has a great career ahead of him) remains a likable lead and does his best with the script. John Turturro (who stole the first one) provides solid support and is always good to watch, Ramon Rodriguez as Leo is pretty annoying and well outstays his welcome and like I said before Duhamel and Gibson are so sidelined they are hardly worth mentioning. I wasn't too keen on Megan Fox as Mikaela this time, despite what most people said about her in the first one I thought she gave a charming performance, however with Fallen she just looked like she couldn't be bothered therefore I didn't care at all about her character. Whats worse is the most attractive female from the first (Australian actress Rachael Taylor as analyst Maggie) wasn't even in this one which was very disappointing; hopefully there's a chance she'll return in the third.<br/><br/>From this review it's clear how little I've mentioned the actual story, thats simply because I don't know what to say about it! Similarly to Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, all sense of fun has been drained out and all we get is an over complicated, overlong film. I couldn't even tell you who the Fallen is and what he's getting revenge against, so either the film wasn't clear enough about him or it just got to the point I couldn't care anymore.<br/><br/>So as it is, Revenge of the Fallen is a major disappointment and just shows that you should never assume a great idea can only get better. Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg, along with screenwriter Ehren Kruger (Star Trek writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman bailed after this one thinking the idea could go stale) seriously have their work cut out for the third film (which is due out summer 2011) and need to tone down extensively in many areas and hopefully recapture the magic of the first film. Despite how many feel about Bay I think he's a good filmmaker (see The Rock & The Island) and I'm confident he can still turn the Transformers franchise around."

Hey how about the phone number to Megan Fox? And oh, just tell those road patrol you are from New York and they will immediately turn friendly and let you through. I didn't know that New York is a universal password.<br/><br/>The humans are fantastic too, with their bullet and missile dodging ability, putting Matrix to shame. They must have dodged like a few hundred bullets, or its high time for decepticons to recalibrate their targeting systems.<br/><br/>One scene that remains memorable though.

","Whoever let Bay loose on Transformers should be stomped.<br/><br/>Despite the cool CGI and the thrill of the live action, the movies leave *a lot* to be desired. The characterisation are stuffed, the I mean did Bay actually ever really *watch one SINGLE G1 episode? Was he colorblind or deaf? They could have at least got the voice actors to resemble the G1 voices. (Having Optimus looking and sounding right are these movies' only saving grace - despite the fact he wouldn't've blown Demoloshor's brains out like that, without reason -- say the Decepticon was going for a gun, or had a bomb - then Prime would've had no alternative) And look at G1 Megatron, Starscream and Ironhide for example. Ironhide is supposed to be red to represent Iron... And if they can make '84 Optimus look so cool, why couldn't they do the same with Megatron and Starcsream? <br/><br/>The movie also lacked substance and intelligence (like Bay's brain) - & not to mention Starscream (who looked like a stupid chunky monkey)... Well... They say directors like to put a likeness of themselves in the movie ... (No offence intended, Starscream) Man, the G1 Dinobots could've put together a better movie. What's wrong with blockbusters these days?!?!? - look at the uber travesty that is Gi-Joe... I was genuinely surprised to find that wasn't a Bay movie. Perhaps Sommers and he are related? Or they share the same single brain cell. Every other week Bay gets it.<br/><br/>Bay's travesties are nothing but his fantasy of what he wants Transformers to be. If he played with Transformers when he was a kid he probably had his Ravage humping his Soundwave. If he wants to make robot porn movies, let him - but why let this rabid Earth Germ loose on TransFormers? I bet if Revenge of the Fallen was on www.fanfiction.net he'd get crappy reviews and he'd be banned from newsgroups like alt.toys.transformers for being a complete and utter imbecile and a Mary-Sue. As I saw on one fanfic website ""Mary Sues will be shot on sight."" No wonder Bay didn't submit his stuff there. Ahh  so THAT'S why his Megatron isn't a gun The plot thickens (like Bay's head) <br/><br/>Sadly these new Transformers movies are nothing but Michael Bay's fantasy (puerile at that) on what he wants Transformers to be. He should stick to writing bad fan fiction -- The sad difference is he had connections and $$ to make the movies when the REAL fans who care about the show have to cringe and grit our teeth at how he's raped what we have loved since the 80's (even the 70's if you followed the original Japanese Dialcone toys)<br/><br/>I was hoping for an amazing Oscar winning blockbuster with story, substance, heart and soul like Lord of the Rings. A pity they didn't team Spielberg with Peter Jackson (and have some TF fans on the team).<br/><br/>The REAL fans demand a REAL Transformers movie ... It's not to late to get rid of Bay and do something decent and breathe life once again into that which we love."

The second movie was not that lucky. The effects are the only nice thing in the movie and even so, you have just milliseconds to enjoy them. The plot is sufficient maybe for a commercial but not for a whole movie. The worst thing is that the characters are completely changing their behavior during the movie without any reasons according to what the scenes demand. So M. Bay wants me to play complete idiot and loser, I will do it, in the next scene I will be the smartest person living on Earth, OK I will do that too, in the next I will be the bravest one and survive 50 feet falls without a scratch and so on. The result is the completely confused viewer and zero continuity in the plot. The second worst thing is M. Bay's obsession with poses, of soldiers, of the robots and at least but not last with the main female character. The problem is that these poses have no meaning in the movie, they are just here and as this they are painful and absurd. The money this movie cost are tremendous for the result. Get real M.

"hrstar24","1","3","11","8 July 2009"," A struggle to sit through the entire thing
","There are very few directors out there who are able to make a sequel to a movie and have it take the audience on another unique adventure that outshines the first. James Cameron can do it, George Lucas (I know he didn't direct Empire Strikes Back but he wrote it), and just last year Christopher Nolan proved he could do it too. With Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, Armegeddon) proves that he definitely cannot do it.<br/><br/>The film is set two years after the first ended, where the US Army and the Autobots have combined to form a unit called NEST. It is NEST's job to hunt down the evil Decepticons left on Earth. It appears that Megatron, the leader of the Decepticons in the original, is actually just a peon and The Fallen, an extremely old robot, is the leader and begins another assault on our world. Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) meanwhile leaves his family and his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) behind to attend Princeton University, which appears to have become populated with the hottest girls on the planet and is now an insane party school. Sam once again becomes hunted by the Decepticons because he holds the key to their past in his brain, and he teams up with NEST to destroy them.<br/><br/>The first scene is by far the best part of the movie, which isn't saying much. NEST tears through Shanghai as they hunt Decepticons, which leads to some spectacular robot fights and shows off the new and improved Autobots. Like the first movie, these robots have pretty creative designs, especially a trio of motorcycles. Finding any other positives in this trash heap is a chore. There is a good fight scene in a forest, and the girls in the movie are definitely easy to look at. especially Fox, but that's about it. Let me remind you this is a two and a half hour movie, so it becomes real boring real quick.<br/><br/>The writing, plot, and characters are so bad it makes the movie near unwatchable. This time around it is absolutely impossible to make any connections with the leading characters, whether they are human or robots. The plot is even worse. It is so random, full of plot holes, and boring that most of the audience had no clue what was going on, they were just hoping there would be a robot fight soon, and there wasn't. The climactic battle is a big joke. The humor is nothing more than surprisingly graphic jokes, like a college professor hitting on the girls in his lecture like its no big deal, or some stereotypical black robots complete with gangly ears and gold crooked teeth.<br/><br/>Even if you loved the first movie, it would be hard to like this one. Megatron, who was the biggest baddest robot that destroyed everyone else in a fight, gets turned into nothing more than a sissy little henchmen, which will leave many fans disappointed. The diversity of the robots in the first one is completely gone, and by the end of the movie the Decepticons are nothing more that generic silver robots with a gun.<br/><br/>Overall, this film takes an extreme fortitude to be able to get through. It is like a boring class lecture, where minutes seem to take hours to pass. It absolutely fails to grab the audiences attention and hook them into the characters, making it impossible to focus on the confusing plot. If Bay took two steps forward after making the first Transformers, and he took 100 steps back with this sequel.<br/><br/>3/10"
"filmfan572","7","3","11","19 June 2009"," Amazing - But not as good as the first
","I read in EMPIRE magazine that Steven Spielberg said that he could see the TRANSFORMERS franchise going on for a long, long time but that the best movie in the series would be made first. So far, that seems to be pretty much true. Do not get me wrong: TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN was superb. It just did not have that spark the first one had.<br/><br/>We start off with a prologue by Optimus Prime about how the transformers arrived on earth long before anyone knew. OK - That's cool. We then cut to the first of the action sequences which, as an opener is pretty amazing and surpasses that of the first film. Then we cut to Sam who has a sliver of the Allspark caught in his jacket. As soon as he touches it he begins to see symbols which are imprinted in his memory, something which the Decepticons need to find a new source of Energon to keep their race alive. Now they have a reason to go after Sam, the action really kicks in. The plot however, tries to take itself seriously and it never really works. Of course, we all go to a TRANSFORMERS film to see robots fight each other but its impossible to try and ignore the plot because of the way it takes itself seriously. The film slows in the middle and shows no sign of picking up until the end 30 minutes which is a massive battle in the Egyptian desert.<br/><br/>The last battle is nothing short of spectacular (Devastator climbing up a pyramid / The Fallen chucking tanks around everywhere) but at times you do become a little bored and find it hard to follow amongst all of the explosions that take place. You can't help but think that Michael Bay can offer nothing new and so takes the viewpoint that he'll do everything the same as in TRANSFORMERS, just bigger... Sometimes less is more.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the sequel is fantastic and i still have respect for the franchise. Shia and Megan have great chemistry as do his comedic parents. The Fallen, however, is terribly underused (A 'Venom in Spiderman 3 moment' comes to mind) It is hard to see how a sequel will be made out of this one as the plot that was carried over from the first film pretty much concludes. However, I'm sure something will arise. Go to the cinema, sit back with your popcorn, and enjoy some mindless, dumb fun. I for one will be seeing it again. 7/10"

","College freshman Shia LaBeouf appears to be on his way to a normal life after the events of the original, but soon his mind is entranced with strange Egyptian symbols which hold the key for the Decepticons to use the sun as energy needed to take over the planet. Hit-and-miss sequel does basically accomplish what its predecessor did with non-stop action mixing with would-be witty one-liners, beautiful women, and sleek technologies. With all that said, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" still lacks the complexities and depth of legitimate film-making vehicles to be much of a movie from a critical standpoint. Director Michael Bay would rather get thoughts across with confusing action sequences and seemingly unending chaos which often becomes more tiring and migraine-inducing than thought-provoking and interesting. 2.5 out of 5 stars."
"zorroe","Null","2","6","26 November 2009"," this movie sucked!!!
","i have to say i was really, REALLY disappointed with this movie. I had really high hopes after the disappointment of the first. After actually avoiding the release of this one, i was lured into watching it by my friends. I told them why i didn't like the first one and they said the second was a lot better. Basically my problem with both installments is that it seems that both were made with 8-12 year olds in mind. 8-12 year olds are gonna see a movie about robots that turn into cars no matter what the story line is, so they should have had a good one, also they should not have geared the movie for kids, instead they should have made them both for the adults, the kids who used to watch them, but that are now much more savvy. p.s. did the whole movie have to be made in slow motion? its running time is listed as 150 minutes, it could easily have been 90 minutes without all the slow motion parts."
"Wanson","7","2","6","25 October 2009"," It's not Godfather II but...
","... what were you expecting?<br/><br/>This movie has a lot of faults. Shia la Boeuf, his character's parents, Sam' s ridiculous room- mate and his dorm mates. Seriously - he's in a dorm 1 day and has the place plastered floor to roof in posters of half naked chicks. I like the naked form as much as the next guy but even in my horniest years ( not that long ago btw ) I'd have a couple of posters at best,<br/><br/>That said. Still a really good transformers movie. The story is better than the first movie. It's got Starscream being the two-faced prick that he is, its's got Soundwave and Rampage, and Devastator! It's like Michael Bay stole my 8 year old dreams and put them on a 50ft screen!<br/><br/>Loved it!"
"evilpoptart834","6","2","6","24 October 2009"," ""Pretty"" good movie.
","Overall, it was a good movie. I liked the action, but not so much the sexual jokes. While some may consider repeated sexual jokes funny, I don't think they belong in this movie; they belong in a Seth Rogen movie. There were also WAY too many robots. It was difficult to follow the robots and determine which robot is which. While the good robots were easy to tell apart, the Decepticons all look pretty similar. Megan Fox is going to end up in adult movies if she doesn't get some acting lessons, and that's the honest truth. Shia Labeouf was pretty good. He showed emotion and he was believable most of the time. If there's a third movie, the parents need to die. I was hoping they were going to die in this movie, but unfortunately their bad acting remains..."

","OK now due to 2009's not great line up of cinema releases, including Terminator Salvation which I have yet to still see and X-Men Origins we haven't had much to look forward to. However with Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen we have a better robot film than Salvation, in comparison anyway. Good CGI, good acting from the cast including Megan Fox and of course the action keeps most entertained like myself. <br/><br/>Maybe they need to rethink some concepts and elements for the next instalment, rather than re-chewing the old things from the first film and making a second film. All in all it was a good film at least to me and others who think the same, remember there aren't many great films out there so accept the good ones or at the very least the amusing ones."
"kingducky25","8","2","6","8 August 2009"," It did what it was designed to do
","Now, honestly, I don't understand all the gripes critics have with the movie. Yes, it isn't Hollywood's finest, and I damn well agree. It only had a mediocre story line, horrible dialogue, and to be honest some extraneous plot that was simply unnecessary.<br/><br/>But why would you want to watch Transformers? You watch it for the action sequences. You want to see some awesome fight scenes between alien robots. You go into a Michael Bay film expecting nothing but action. In fact, I appreciate the Transformers series for what it is...entertaining action sequences.<br/><br/>As a holistic movie, it's terrible. But Transformers 2 was never meant to be a holistic movie. It's a summer action flick, and it was top grossing because it excelled at what it was supposed to do. Robots, cars, and guns (and Megan Fox for some)."
"zan_dra_3","9","2","6","17 July 2009"," Actionfilled and fun
","I loved the first movie so I had a lot of doubt about this movie. I didn't really feel excited after seeing the trailers. But the movie exceeded my expectations. I fell in love with this one too. It's not as good as the fist one but very entertaining and funny, and it was very nice to see the old characters from the first one. Specially John Turturro. Who was WONDERFUL in this movie. He does his roll as Agent Simmons like no other could. Now I can't wait for a third movie, and I really hope that they will make one more. ;P <br/><br/>This is a movie I would recommend if you like action, comedy and robots. And if you don't mind bad acting(from Megan Fox, who was outshone by Bumblebee)."
"jordell5","8","2","6","13 July 2009"," Simply transformed my interest in films.
","It has been a long while since I've seen a movie from the cinema that has both mesmerized and has consistently kept my attention and enjoyment throughout the entire film. This movie truly did it for me! I went in with almost zero expectations and only had the prequel(which i thoroughly enjoyed also) to anticipate what I was expecting. I myself am not even a fan of the 'Transformers' series- I've seen bits of it when I was a child but that is the limit of my knowledge.<br/><br/>So what did I love and dislike about Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen? Firstly, and to me the most important of all, was simply the action. The jaw-dropping transformations from vehicles to fighting machines, The fast paced action and camera movement, the clash of metal, and countless explosions. This movie was jam-packed full of action and I simply loved it. No-one, and I mean no-one can fault Transformers 2 for it's CGI and fight sequences that in almost every sense became shinier and upgraded from the first film. I entered the cinemas with my mates looking for an epic popcorn movie and that is what I was given. I'm not going to lie- the plot was very lack-luster but by no means terrible. The story does what it needs to by paving the way for the clichÃ© battle of good VS Evil to unfold, and thats it. But did you really expect a mind-blowing story? Not everything can be catered for in a 2 hour film extracted from a long TV series. The prequel was exactly the same.<br/><br/>Secondly, the comedy was genuinely funny. I laughed a lot during the whole film almost in tears of joy. I looked for a film that entertained me and humoured me. Sam's parents were more whacky and hilarious in this sequel too. I found the Robotic Twins overall no where near as annoying as most people did, but yes they were a weakness of this film. FYI I'm 22 years old, and though Transformers 2 is mainly targeted at kids and teens I am not ashamed to admit that I chucked as much as everyone watching it too. Yes I will admit that certain aspects of its humour was immature and repetitive gags about 'scrotum' and 'balls' were noticed by myself, but who cares?. Why be so serious? <br/><br/>Thirdly, the romance/women. Being the typical male I don't have that much interests in chick-flicks ,but still care for romance and the pretty ladies. Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas were both stunning as their characters and their acting was convincing enough, though average. There wasn't much chemistry Between Sam and Mikaela but there was plenty of flirting and banter to keep girl and guy viewers interested.<br/><br/>My fourth category is the music. Keeping this short and, the music was apt and fitting for all the scenes from heated battles to sadness. Nothing negative here. I've listened to the OST of the film and almost every song on there is great. If you enjoyed the music in the film I recommend you buy or download the music- you won't regret it.<br/><br/>Overall it pushes all my buttons. Any film that keeps my interest peaking from start to finish is brilliant in my eyes. I'm only speaking for myself, but I believe the vast majority who see this film will not bedisappointed. The hardcore fans (and minority) of the Transformers cartoon series are probably the bulk of the unhappy viewers, but that is always the case.<br/><br/>In essence my message is to enjoy the film for what it is. Switch off your brain and marvel in an action-packed, CGI masterpiece. You will find yourself laughing and musing again and again every time you watch this film,but several forced and repetitive jokes and a weak plot prevent me from giving it a top score. This film is not perfect, nor is hardly any other. Enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>8/10"
"MovieVision","9","2","6","12 July 2009"," Good movie, most negative comments from voters are over the top
","Fellow voters, <br/><br/>I have seen a lot of negative critics that suggest some viewers felt personally insulted or betrayed by the movie. I do agree that this movie has some weak scenes that could have been left out by Michael Bay. This is the only negative critic I can agree with.<br/><br/>Voters or viewers who have known the original transformers cartoon, know how thin the original story line was. The original intent of Hasbro was to create a cartoon to sell their toys. I believe that a movie script should always stick to the original story as much as possible. It's up to the director and the producers to audio visualize this as creative and professional as possible. <br/><br/>Knowing this I believe Michael Bay has done a terrific job and as an entertainment movie experience I truly enjoyed it. <br/><br/>If you are looking for an artful drama movie with a lot of spiritual meaning hidden in it, then why would you ever go to a movie about toys attacking Earth? <br/><br/>Therefore, most negative critics are from people who truly misunderstood the original intention of this movie. Do not forget that great directors like Steven Spielberg were involved in the production of the Transformers' movie. Besides, this movie has already generated a global revenue of over US$ 600 million. How bad can it be then?<br/><br/>Just like with most things in life: ""Different movies for different entertainment needs"".<br/><br/>Make your judgment with knowledge about the original history, so that you truly understand the accurate intention of the movie. Only then your movie critics really make sense. <br/><br/>Making a good movie is a skill, but enjoying a movie in its true meaning and respecting its history, is a true art. Just like with wine. <br/><br/>Just like in real life, not everything what you see, hear and taste, is what you expected and may not appeal to you the first time, but we all know that differences in life and in entertainment offers make life an enjoying experience. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading,"
"zitzy2000","9","2","6","11 July 2009"," Why is everyone saying this movie is a bad movie.
","I just left the theaters seeing this, and usually when I read reviews here in IMDb, they are 9 of out 10 accurate.<br/><br/>So I got to the movies, not expecting to see much, and I was completely glued to the seat. The only time I wasn't was when my little girl needed to use the bathroom, and I knew the length of it, and she couldn't have held it in.. anyway.<br/><br/>This was a fantastic special effects, blow-up-a-thon. I loved it. People are saying the acting is fake, it has no plot, it's definitely not a good movie, it sucks. But it's none of that.<br/><br/>The acting, the same as the first, there is much more comedy in it, which was great, quite a few laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>The plot?? Did anyone that said it had no plot whatsoever actually see the movie?? I guess not. The plot is that more bad guys are coming to earth, and are going to destroy it. There is something called the Matrix Key, like the All Spark in the first movie, and its gotta be used to stop them.... Sounds like a plot to me.<br/><br/>Special effects, just plain AWESOME!!!! It also seems a lot more violent than the first one. Like in this one you see a transformer put his fist through another transformer, and a sword like thing gets put through another transformer, kinda graphic, but very well done. Loved it all.<br/><br/>Megan and Shia. Megan OMG complete eye candy, gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous, and of course she can act. Shia, great actor, very funny in parts. His mom and dad, very funny. The chemistry in the first one, was there in the second one.<br/><br/>New Transformers. Ha, the two black acting transformers, including a gold tooth, they were very funny, one of the lines ""Hey that hurt"", ""Yeah? It's supposed to hurt, thats why they call it an ass kicking"". The other little evil Decepticon robot, with a Jersey accent who tries to hump Megans leg? Hilarious. So wrong on so many levels, but freaking hilarious.<br/><br/>The only bad thing I can see with this movie, and I saw it in the first movie too. You can't really see who is fighting who in some of it. I mean they are these hulking machines rolling around, and they are all made out of metal, the good guys have some color, and the bad guys don't, but you still cant see 100%, but that's the ONLY bad thing there is about both movies.<br/><br/>Apart from that, excellent movie. Well worth the money spent to go see it."

"enderbean29","8","2","6","10 July 2009"," Very Good, but check your brain at the door
","Overall, I thought this movie was on par with the last one. There were quite a few things I enjoyed about the movie. Even though I could do without some parts, I thought that the movie was well paced. The fight scenes were spectacular. The robots' movements were fluid and there were lots of explosions. The best fight was with Optimus, Megatron, Starscream, and Grindor. It was well choreographed. I did enjoy seeing the new Transformers such as Soundwave, Arcee, and Sideswipe. I wish all three would have been in the movie more.<br/><br/>I could have done without the twins. I understand that they were there for the younger audiences but they annoyed me quite a bit until they fought Devastator. I love Sam's parents in the first movie but I think his mom was a bit over the top. The reasons for her actions when they were at school were a bit over the top. Also, there were some holes in the plot.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie almost any moviegoer, but check your brain at the door."

"adam_uk09","8","2","6","9 July 2009"," A thrill from start to finish!
","The good, the bad, and the down right ugly return in the sequel to Michael Bay's 2007 summer blockbuster, Transformers. Revenge of the Fallen picks up 2 years after the events of the first film and really shows why Michael Bay was again the perfect choice to helm this franchise.<br/><br/>Speculation about how long the film was going to be has finally been answered. 2 and a half hours for the uninitiated would seem a terrifying prospect as characters are introduced from all corners; but for fans of the bots, it's a thrill ride from the very start, right up until the end credits role.<br/><br/>Shia Le Beouf and Megan Foxx return as Sam Witwicky and love interest Mikeala in a sequel that's as loud as it is long. As with the first film, the story is a little thin on the ground, but thankfully there is enough here to satisfy even the hardest to please. The Decepticons (the bad guys) are mobilizing once again to take control of Earth, while the Autobots (the good guys) working together with human intelligence try to destroy their feared rivals.<br/><br/>Special effects are again outstanding with a finish on them that not even the first movie could hold a candle to, the transformers once more look 100% realistic in their presence, though with a $200m budget, outstanding was the least to be expected. Unfortunately, the action sequences sometimes can look messy, with a mash of metal making it hard to distinguish who is attacking who or who has fallen; one heart wrenching scene in particular makes this point even more evident.<br/><br/>Peter Cullen does an excellent job as the voice of Autobot leader Optimus Prime, with the same gravely texture that made him such a hit for the cartoon series in the first place. Hugo Weaving also returns as the voice of arch nemesis Megatron.<br/><br/>Bay packs on the slapstick in this sequel, perhaps going a little too far with the humour; after all, it isn't supposed to be an outright comedy, though some of the funny touches are out-and-out hilarious.<br/><br/>The finale is, as with its predecessor a little short and to the point, though many would say it was 'succinct', but any longer and the film would have started to drag, Bay obviously learning his lesson from the mess that was Pearl Harbour.<br/><br/>Overall then, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an excellent sequel to what promises to be an exciting future for the franchise. Whilst it may not match its predecessor in terms of story and plot, it surpasses it in so many different ways. It's a must watch for all action cravers."
"yankeeskins","7","2","6","7 July 2009"," Not as bad as everyone says
","1) Movie length - could have been reduced by 20 mins. For those who are complaining that the movie was too long though, are you the same people who complain that movies are too short? For the price of movies these days, I'm glad someone gave me more than a 90 min movie.<br/><br/>2) Special effects and action - they were terrific. At least in this movie, i'm glad he showed some of the robot fight scenes a little more. I felt a little cheated in the first movie.This is definitely not a kids movie. Parents with young kids, I would not recommend. It is overly violent for only a PG-13 rating.<br/><br/>3) Character development - we could have used more of Capt Lennox and his team. Felt they were overplayed in the first one but underplayed in the sequel. Folks, we don't need a back story of every single robot who enters the movie. I think the explanation of, ""Prime invited them"" is sufficient enough. Some of them could have been given more of a ""personality"" and we could have used less of mudflaps and skids. would have preferred the trio of motorcycles.<br/><br/>4) Story - It's no Oscar winner, but the story holds together better than people would lead you to believe. it's a summer blockbuster, something to pass the days of summer with. If you want something to write your thesis on, go see something else!"

","I went and saw this movie with the expectation of it not being as good as the first, i was wrong. Yes it didn't have the same feeling as the first but it wasn't completely terrible. The movie was actually really good i was upset about how little action there was in the first, but yes this was kinda a overload of action but it is a summer movie what would you expect. The action was great and jaw-dropping and the acting was good not perfect. But i was a fan of the original show and movie from the 80s and I'm not that disappointed because even though there is a lot of mess ups its still a great movie and yes Michael bay isn't the best director but he did the best he could. Even the cartoon is filled with nothing but action and a few laughs the same as the movies. Yes the first was better but i like them. Transformers is one of my favorite movies and number is one of my favorites now too. But i do believe people should quite talked crap about this movie is good not great not Oscar-winning but still good.<br/><br/>Id give this movie a 9.5 out 10, the first a 10 because they both are good movie and they have some flows but they are still good"
"jediskippy","7","2","6","6 July 2009"," It is Transformers people. What do you expect?
","Is it the greatest movie ever? No. Is it a pile of garbage? No.<br/><br/>Apparently the majority of people who write reviews and deem themselves God's gift to reviewing movies don't understand how to enjoy a movie ever. I am so tired of reviews that talk about nothing about how horrible the movie was.<br/><br/>Complaints I've read:<br/><br/>1) There were too many robots. It's transformers. It's supposed to have a lot of robots.<br/><br/>2) I went to see it honestly wanting to like it. This is my personal favorite. You went in wanting to like it, but 6 seconds into the movie you found something that ruined the whole movie for you, so you ended up writing 2 full pages about every little thing you didn't like about it. That opening line is nothing more than you trying to pose as someone who is unbiased when you saw this movie when that is clearly not the case.<br/><br/>3) Michael Bay is a terrible director. This is the movie that decided that for you? Michael Bay has made better films, but he has made worse ones as well. There is nothing in this movie that is out of character with what he has done in his other films. He makes movies that are meant to be entertaining on a basic level, not win scores of Oscars. Sorry for all you ""purists"" that believe if it's not made by Kubrick, Coppolla, Zwick, Scorcese, Tarantino, etc it's crap. How many of you went in to see this movie expecting it to be ""The Shawshank Redemption""? Learn to enjoy a simple fun movie for what it is.<br/><br/>4) I disagreed with where the plot went. Yes, everyone is entitled to their opinion, but simply because it's not what you would have done doesn't mean it's terrible. Unless you are an esteemed screenplay writer yourself this complaint has no validation.<br/><br/>5) There is no action until the end. What movie were you watching?<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I'll end there.<br/><br/>Here's my bottom line opinion for Transformers 2.<br/><br/>It's fun. It's entertaining. Do I like everything about it? No. But I still enjoyed it because I went in with a simple mindset of it's an action movie with awesome special effects a simple story and some humor thrown in. It's not trying to be anything more than that.<br/><br/>I will say I wouldn't take my kids to this movie if they're younger than 14. The humor in there along with some of the characters tries to take aim at the younger audience, but comes up short. It is still more of an adult humor with language thrown in. <br/><br/>The story is easy to follow and I didn't find myself ever wondering; ""who is that?"" or ""what is going on?"". It is easy to distinguish between the Autobots and Decepticons, so fortunately needless time is not spent on identifying who is who. The story is sufficient for the entertainment level the movie is trying to give. The goal here was not to win an Oscar for the screenplay unlike what a lot of people who have ""reviewed"" this movie seem to think.<br/><br/>The special effects are fantastic. This really doesn't need to be said, but I'll say it anyway. The special effects are the heart of this movie. Yes, they're on the screen for most of the movie, but that is to be expected. The effects are the subject matter.<br/><br/>Some movies are simply made to entertain and not win awards. This is one of them. If you want it to be fun and just look for the things you like about the movie then you will enjoy it."
"Wiscomptin","Null","2","6","6 July 2009"," Yet another high-fund/low fun, CGI circus that's unable to hold attention, or add plot.
","There are so many things wrong with Transformers: RotF. Let me begin in a top-ten list format to quickly express my gripes: 1.First, the movie was too long, clocking in at 150min: Basically depending on how far you commute to your local theater, you are wasting an estimated +3hr on this mediocre, brainless summer flick.<br/><br/>2.Second the plot, or lack thereof: Yes there was a plot and yes it was BARELY enough to keep this fireworks show of silly action scenes moving forward. The movie is all mindless action, no character interaction or simple character building. Only what is necessary to move the action scenes forward.<br/><br/>3.Excessive Product placement anyone? Are transformers limited to GM products only? Why did we need to hear that Sam's parents are insured by Allstate? 4. Once the first Transformers was announced, EVERYONE suddenly expressed they were Die-hard Transformers fans and that they had been fans since a very young age, much like when superman,spider-man,xmen, hell-boy,fantastic 4, and both In.Hulks were announced: they are probably lying and are failing at pretending they are ""cool"" 5. Most die hard Transformers fans, like myself, hate this movie. However most people looking for a simple action movie DID enjoy it.<br/><br/>6.Megan Fox-Very attractive don't get me wrong, but she couldn't act herself out of an episode of Blue's Clues. Ill sacrifice a nice pair of legs and pretty face for an actress that can do other things then bend over in front of the camera.<br/><br/>7.Why did Dreamworks approve a second Transformers? Because the simple fact that: it makes bank. The movie is mindless spending and random effects and explosions trying to shield a bad script and bad plot.<br/><br/>8.The non-funny ""unneeded"" transformers: They are not funny, nor did they contribute to the story progression whatsoever.<br/><br/>9.CGI: The action scenes are too detailed and hectic for the average human to fully appreciate in one viewing, thus most action scenes are ""too"" gorgeous, and I say that meaning that the illusion that the movie aims to create with CGI is way overdone, and it feels like you are playing a really detailed computer game rather than the adrenaline filled film it could have been.<br/><br/>10. The under use of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. It seems to me that these two were put in the movie ONLY to boast about, and NOT to have any significant role in the progression of the film. The movie changes NONE if Tyrese had not been in it, heck all he says is a smart comment like ""we're about to get our asses whooped!"" or the movie changing quote of ""that guy is an asshole!"". You really should wonder if those making this movie are insulting your intelligence?"

Michael Bay obviously thinks that SFX = good movie. I cannot even begin to mention all the inconsistencies and plot holes this movie has because I do not know where to start. There were too much action and stuff going on all at once, stuff that doesn't make sense, even for a movie. It seems that all the big booms were specially made to cover up for the bad storyline.

","This is an extraordinary awesome breathtaking gorgeous movie !!! It's the best movie for the last six years, since The Lord of the Rings - the Return of the King was released. I just saw it and it almost gave me the goosebumps, it has a lot of nice sequences in there and i think that the third part will be better than all the previous ones (after all Michael Bay directs). We all know that Michael Bay is a good director (he gave us samples of it with his previous movies - see Bad Boys, Armageddon, The Rock, The Island and Pearl Harbor) and no one could have directed it better than him, it is what we say ""the right man in the right place""I am looking forward for transformers 3 maybe in two years we see."
"vpts","8","2","6","4 July 2009"," Worth to watch at the cinema
","There are a lot of low rate comments here but I think people expected too much on the content of the movie. I watched several blockbusters from the beginning of this year on this style: Action, Adventure. This movie is one of the best, I think. The beginning, it was bad with messy information and scenes. When Sam Witwicky and Mikaela Banes appeared, the movie went on the correct way. It came with more logical order in comparison with the Transformer 1. All details of the movie were interesting and reasonable. If you go to the cinema, you can enjoy the spectacular actions with a lot of new robots. The movie also came with some touch moments but in some scenes, it seems to take a little long time and make you tired in waiting for the next action scenes. It is worth to see at the cinema!"
"renesis107","8","2","6","3 July 2009"," Transformers was awesome
","I thought the movie was FANTASTIC! I think Michael Bay did a great job in creating a movie about a TOY. I understand why critics are burning this one to the ground, such as plot holes, and racism. BUT WHO CARES!? ITS A MOVIE BASED ON A TOY! A toy that everyone, if not everyone, has played with or seen once in their lifetime. A vehicle that transforms into a robot. A crazy ridiculous idea that has amazed and fascinated billions of KIDS for years. And they made a movie about it. <br/><br/>The first transformers movie had a pretty good story, but revenge of the fallen action was much more amazing than the first one. If you go into the movie expecting to see a great FILM, which it is not, you will be disappointed. A FILM is a message or a story that puts the audience in an emotional stance about a character(s). A MOVIE is something I can take my girlfriend to on a Friday night to just entertain ourselves for that 2 hours. And ""critics"" do not see the difference. Everything must be perfect for them. Its like if you were to go to Disney Land, one of the greatest places on earth, with a sour attitude, of course your experience is going to be miserable if you act and think that way throughout the whole time you are there. You are just going to ruin everyone else experience with your attitude. But going to see this MOVIE with a open mind about a TOY, I was blown away. Fights I had with my own transformer toys I had as a kid were not as epic as Michael Bay put on screen and I thank Michael Bay for this.<br/><br/>It's hard for a director in these times to have a vision and to fulfill his vision from start to finish without big power house production companies stepping in and taking over because that's not how they want to release it. Tearing not just one persons work but many people who put their heart and soul into a MOVIE or a FILM. Michael Bay did his job as he was paid to do, as a director should. Now-a-days production companies are so worried that they won't make a buck, and step in not knowing what the hell is going on and ruin everything. Fox is the worst about it next to Sony (Spider-Man 3 ring a bell?). Warner Bros. actually gives freedom to their visionaries (Chris Nolan, Zach Snyder) as well as Paramount and Universal. And you can see it has paid off well with them. Marvel opened up there first studio a few years ago not knowing what the hell they were doing. They handed Jon Favreau Iron Man and got out of his way. Iron Man is now a pop culture icon because of him. Yet studios have not learned from this?<br/><br/>It is funny how studios did come as low as to a TOY to make a MOVIE. And recycle characters to this day (Friday the Thirteenth, Texas Chainsaw) it's insulting to the public. ""The public is so stupid we will just retell the story make more money off them"". If studios are not willing to take risk as they had in the past of introducing Jason, Michael Myers, or even Marty McFly they wouldn't be where they are now. And Michael Bay was given a TOY. By Paramount. The writers' strike went on last year, and Michael Bay still worked on the movie cause he believed in it. And I respect anyone who has a passion in whatever they do and overcome the obstacles that hit their way. People and ""critics"" need to relax about this movie. I feel bad for Michael Bay getting what he has got from ""critics"" the last few weeks...BUT IT WAS A MOVIE BASED ON A TOY!! Megan Fox recently had the guts to tell Michael Bay that he focused on special effects than acting and that's why its getting bad reviews. Have you not seen his last 7 films Megan? Better yet did you not read the script? As a professional actress should? I guess you just waited for these ""critics"" and just changed sides because you're scared about your career. You did film the movie? I mean that was you bending over on the bike right? Did that moment not hit you and say ""hey I'm not acting, the camera is just dollying to my butt"" I mean he did say he was writing it a little over a year ago. Did I mention THE MOVIE IS BASED ON A TOY! The story is going to follow robots that can transform , then Shia Labeouf. You are just there to make 9 and 10 yr old boy hit puberty early, and become this generation sex icon. And I don't know if pissing off Michael Bay is a good thing considering he is friends with Steven Spielberg, one or the very people who made Hollywood what it is today. Also who got you a start in Hollywood to begin with. As much money as she is getting paid, acting classes should be pocket change for her if she really cared about acting. Megan, yeah you were perfectly crafted by God which is awesome, but he did not give you skills to become an actress. But it's OK. Halle Berry couldn't act when she first started. She worked hard and got an Oscar. So if you really want to act, work at it. <br/><br/>Finally the whole racism thing. WHO CARES?! Its 2009! it's not the '50s anymore you old farts. The twin autobots were entertaining. If you're going to say ""oh I see 2 robots acting black."" who cares!? They didn't say anything against black people. You're racist for thinking about it. And no one likes a racist so drop it. <br/><br/>Thanks Michael Bay for a great MOVIE!!!"
"pleroy-2","9","2","6","3 July 2009"," Love the movie...still some holes, but that is left to the sequels
","I thought the movie was very well made. Yes, maybe some things could be left out, but overall it was very good. I am still trying to figure out the whole racist thing, but I never got that impression from the movie and I feel strongly that this was just a poor excuse to find something wrong with the way this movie was intended to be. There are more movies out there that have far worst racist remarks in them than this movie, but that comment would never be made about them.<br/><br/>The action was great and in some cases I wish they had developed some of the ideas and concepts better...such as the ending....something new....no horizon shot scene like from the previous movie.<br/><br/>Be your own judge of the movie....if you like it...you like it...if you do not...you do not. There is more to this movie than meets the eye...as it was intended to....there are far worst movies out their that are being made, in theaters now, and out on DVD than this one.<br/><br/>Last of all, no one ever complained about all the robots that appeared in the animated movie or cartoons, so what was so different about the so many robots being showed in this movie....absolutely no...it stuck with tradition and having scenes with multiple robots and tons of action...it was just better and louder than the originals...do not get me wrong....I love the classic G1 Transformer: The Movie...I give one piece of advice to Michael Bay...develop the robots more and give them more shape...I understand the newer concept, but it is time for Bumblebee to get his voice back and have a better and more developed face. Good luck to all you movie watchers....and have a great summer."
"azicewarrior","Null","2","6","1 July 2009"," Crappy movie
","I went to see this movie loving the cartoon and enjoying the first movie. However this one sucked the ""wrecking balls"" off the giant robot at the end. The plot of the fallen was a good idea but was not fallowed through, instead the writers the the director wanted the maturity level to be lower than a lampoon movie. They knew going into production that it was going to be targeted to kids, and yet put enough smut and skimpy outfits, and a nasty blonde transformer trying to seduce/kill lebuf. The twin bots where retarded, the romance was forced into the movie leaving a huge gap in the storyline......new auto-bots, destroyed deceticons, i wanted to see more fighting less stupid, mindless collage bs. On top of it all i felt that the whole first hour was trying to set up the giant testicle joke at the end, can we say stupid class? The fx where top notch, minus the lack of rustication between deceticons. I wasted my money on this movie the only way you may get any enjoyment out of this pile of crap is to buy it on DVD ,used mind you if you can find one, and skip all the boring and stupid sub plots. The writers are in my opinion total and utter More-off , yes More-off they have more braincells off then on along with Mr. Bay, he should of seen that this script was used to wipe someones a** with that is how bad it truly was."
"mshawgo","8","2","6","1 July 2009"," Get of your high horses people, Transformers Rules!
","I loved this movie, just like the first. The whole draw of this movie is that those of us that grew up watching Transformers as kids and had all the toys get to see them come alive on the big screen. Yes, the plot isn't great, and if you go in expecting some extraordinary plot, you obviously haven't seen a Michael Bay film before (see South Park, General: ""Those aren't ideas, they're special effects."" Bay: ""I don't... understand...the difference."") I enjoyed seeing the Transformers come alive again. I would like to see them remove the little bit of swearing that was done by some of the transformers, since it's really unnecessary. I think it's the writer's/director's way of show this movie is really for those of us that grew up with Transformers, not for today's kids, but today's kids are watching. Some people were upset that the Transformers weren't in the movie enough, but they sure seemed to be in it a lot more than in the first one. There was a lot more decepticons in it than autobots, but that was because they depict the high up portion of our government as being inept, which prevents the autobots from getting involved in the action earlier, except for the forest scene, which was awesome. It is a little annoying how the government gets in the way, but if it didn't the movie would be over in an hour because the autobots would quickly wipe out the decepticons, because if you watched the cartoons much, you'll remember that the decepticons were pretty inept themselves. They fight, they start to lose, and they run. Now for those people who are upset from diversions from the cartoon and comics, well, I watched every episode as a kid multiple times, but I really don't remember them all that well because lots of my memories from age 8 are rather hazy. So if you're mad about changes they made, I can only assume you should think about growing up sometime and entering the real world. This was a fun movie with wall to wall action and that's all I really expected. Some parts were corny, but that's OK. I was entertained. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!!!! (Sorry, couldn't resist)"
"marcof-1","8","2","6","1 July 2009"," Robots, explosions and hilarity!
","This movie is about Robots, Special effects and action...plus it is really fun! I had a good time, never got bored throughout the movie. The movie was very well balanced, between action and funny moments; despite all the comments, I think Shia LaBeouf did a good Job. I admit the movie has its flaws, sometimes the special effects looked a little confusing, or it was a bit hard to distinguish between the Decepticons and the Autobots, but who cares, overall it was enjoyable: the movie made me laugh, had a lot of decent CGI and the story wasn't that bad. Is it a masterpiece?.....NO....Maybe they could have spared us with some of the silly jokes and the robots' scrotum......., but I admit it....I laughed too! Just to clarify, my 8 is not for the movie, is for the experience I had watching it: I don't pretend to be able to rate movies because I am not a movie director, I do not work in the movie business...I just watch movies for personal gratification....and overall this one pleased me!"
"Chickengirl001","7","2","6","29 June 2009"," What do you expect from a Michael Bay Film?
","I find it very amusing reading all these horrible reviews for this movie..I should point out a few important things that should cover any critique for this film<br/><br/>1. It was Directed by Michael Bay 2. It is a Michael Bay sequel 3. It was co-produced by Steven Spielberg(please go watch the 4th Indiana Jones movie for more reference.)<br/><br/>so if you enjoy watching mind numbing, relentless action with tons of explosions, insane effects and CGI characters than this movie is quite entertaining...those looking for something more than that, look elsewhere cos you will be very disappointed.<br/><br/>people going to see this film expecting to see something great are complete morons. really. I went to see this film with low expectations expecting to see nothing but hardcore action, explosions every 5 minutes and insane Transformer battles and that is what I got so I can't say I was really too disappointed after seeing the movie...<br/><br/>sure the people who have given this movie poor reviews made good points about many things about this film but uh....need I bring up those 3 points I made at the beginning of this review?<br/><br/>bottom line is you ain't gonna get much from a Michael Bay film expect intense action and explosions with more explosions.<br/><br/>visually the movie was extremely entertaining...yeah in some of the battles so much action was happening up so close you couldn't tell what was going on..but otherwise all the scenes with the Transformers fighting each other and the Decepticons annihilating everything was pretty sweet..and the designs for the new Decepticons *hnnng* the Decepticon in the Shanghai scene, Soundwave, and Devastator were awesome as were the rest...<br/><br/>I guess my biggest critiques would revolve around the Transformers themselves which would be that, because so much story and action was crammed into this movie and time was wasted on scenes that didn't need to be so long..further character development for the Autobots was left out..the other Autobots seemed to be pushed away and didn't get much screen time at all..it seemed like they were in car form more than anything else..also it needed moar Bumblebee..there really wasn't any more chara development for him, and he still couldn't talk..since he was plastered all over the movie posters one would think he'd get a big role in this movie but he didn't...I think the Autobots that got the most attention where the ghetto black gangster twin Autobots who just got really annoying after a while....and then when Optimus Prime was finally resurrected and got his upgrades from the Irish turned good Decepticon I expected to see a epic final battle but all this happened at the very end of the movie so the battle only lasted like 5 minutes with Megatron and Starscream quickly pussying out and then the Fallen getting pwned by Optimus Prime in 2 minutes..it could have been a little longer..I mean the Fallen hardly got in on the action at all.. 95% of the movie he was incapacitated in Decepticon planet, and then he did his lil broadcast to the world and then at the very end of the movie came outta nowhere to try and launch his sun destroyer weapon and finally fight Optimus Prime..I think he deserved something more I mean his name is in the freaking title of the movie lol. I did enjoy the relationship between Megatron and Starscream tho.<br/><br/>so yeah i'll stop there...apparently there is going to be a third movie who knows what the hell Michael Bay will do with that one most likely triple the action and explosions..<br/><br/>I gave this movie 7/10 because of my fulfilled expectations for this movie..not based on some credible, expert critique/judgment that SHOULD be given to this movie as a whole or however you wanna put it.<br/><br/>don't get me wrong it would be great to see this series be as good as other films based on books/comics like the newest Batman movies or the LOTR series but with Michael Bay behind the wheel your not gonna get anything like that sorry to say. :/"
"gabeharrison","8","2","6","29 June 2009"," Exactly what I hoped for
","The wonderful thing about these movies is that you get to see part of what you imagined as a child. A full sized, realistic Optimus Prime battling an equally awe inspiring Megatron, complete with the whining Starscream, the ever loyal Ironhide or Soundwave, and the whole host of Transformers.<br/><br/>Beyond that, Michael Bay does what he does best, creates an amazing experience for the eye and ear unlike any other director. Bear in mind he does so with the full backing of the most critically acclaimed American director of the past thirty years. Of course, it's not for everyone to enjoy, nor is it meant to be, but if you liked the first Transformers, there is no reason you wouldn't like RotF.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it is different from the first movie. The plot is a little less believable. Then again, it is a plot dealing with a giant alien robot war happening in our backyard. The logic rulebook should be immediately tossed out and you should prep your suspension of disbelief to reach all new rubbery lengths before you step foot in the theater. That in mind, anyone familiar with the cartoon will not notice anything altogether out of the ordinary for the Transformer universe. This movie does not pretend to cling to reality, which is part of the fun.<br/><br/>The humor hits a little harder this time, but some of the jokes are misses and groaners. Three times throughout the movie I found myself saying aloud that a joke was unnecessary. The sexuality is overt, but again, when you put Megan Fox in a movie, you're really trotting out your one trick pony so anyone paying money to see the movie should expect the one trick.<br/><br/>The last drawback is the pacing. The movie starts in a large battle and ends in a larger battle with a very jolting and sudden grinding halt in the middle. To be honest, the pacing makes sense if there were an act break, where the audience could step out and digest for a few minutes then return for the conclusion. Absent of that, the second third of the movie seems to drag and jump.<br/><br/>On the whole, the movie does exactly what it set out to do. It's no more outlandish or overdone than the original. The graphics are more refined and the audio and score remain top notch for this type of film. I highly recommended it to my friends and so far none have been disappointed.<br/><br/>Note: Many say that this movie demands that you check your IQ at the door and I recommend doing just that. Leave your bills, your job woes, worries about this national crisis or the next -- all of it stays at the door. They'll be there when you walk out, but for the little while you're in the theater, try to revive your imagination and let yourself sleep into the admittedly gratuitous world of Transformers."
"wegvomsethiergehtsumrap","9","2","6","29 June 2009"," ILM Top, Michael Bay FLOP
","I went in this Movie withs the expectation of great CGI, and what i saw was the best CGI up to date. In my small opinion ILM did a great and outstanding job. The robots look so real and are fantastic animated.<br/><br/>But here comes the worse. Bay again decided to use lots of fast cuts and camera switches and adds a lack of slow motions so you don't really have the time to flow with the motion. The Action scenes are cut terribly in pieces which makes you really hard to follow. Specially the last main fight appears as a horror mix of random cuts. I really don't get it. ILM produced complete models with up to 50.000 parts which where fully use able, but in the movie it sometimes appears like they had to save money so they only show little parts from the robots on the screen, as if they had to hide the rest because it wasn't complete. Really sad. Also in the last fight it is nearly impossible to see which robots are Decepticons and which are the Autobots, it just seems like a orgy of 1 sec. cuts.<br/><br/>The story was not the best but not the worst, some of the jokes really cracked down the whole audience i was in with. The story about the ""Transformer Nerd"" who shares an apartment with ""Sam"" was really useless and i didn't liked it. Since i cant separately vote, i'll have to give ILM 10* and Bay 1* which leads me to: 10-1= 9 I hope there's gonna be a part 3 (since they already earned double the production costs) but then really fall in love with the CGI and wrap it with a tight story<br/><br/>greetings from Germany"
"quikbdr720","8","2","6","29 June 2009"," As a movie buff who usually dissects movies, with an action film this great, there's nothing to dissect, ITS CALLED HAVING FUN AND IMMERSING YOURSELF IN ENTERTAINMENT
","I am having trouble understanding why ROTF is getting all the negativity it has been. I'll be honest I walked in skeptical after reading the reviews, but came out confused at why it was getting this punishment. If you liked the first one you'll LOVE this one! When you go see a film titled ""TRANSFORMERS"", DO NOT expect this years ""Best Picture with dazzling performances (well, the robots performed, but until there is a best supporting autobot award, you still are watching Lebouf and Fox at the lead, not exactly DiCaprio & Winslett!!!)"". This is not Slumdog Millionaire, No Country for Old Men, etc etc. this was clearly made as an action film. and it was a GREAT action film. This film had just as good of a plot (actually 3, 1 main and 2 great sub plots, saying no more, don't want any spoilers!) as the first film. The acting was maybe even a step up (even MEgan Fox, wasn't all there just for her stunning STUNNINGNESS, she actually wasn't a piece of wood talking). The only downfall is Bay struggles at overusing a joke multiple times, too many sexual innuendos, but it doesn't distract you for long at all. He could have also narrowed down some scenes(not the action though!) to bring the film to 2hrs from 2 1/2, but it wasn't hard to watch either way. I can't say much more, sometimes, especially with the way the world is today, you need to step out of reality and into a world of entertainment, that is what the magic of movies is all about, and for 2 1/2 hours, I was there again, and its been awhile since I went to a movie with no intent on dissecting it, just watching it for pure fun!!! Im sure my review on Public Enemies will be more in depth, and why not, Depp, Bale, Mann...<br/><br/>The basic...<br/><br/>GREAT ACTION, Great intriguing plots for an action film, good character development for old and new characters, hilarious one liners, and Bumblebee and Optimus are killer! Go see this film to be entertained and enjoy some Michael Bayed explosions, DO NOT go if you can't just enjoy some fun without being critical, Stupid critics, wait for a film that is centered around drama and A-list actors who are EXPECTED to give it their all!!!"

DO not listen to the critics. You can tell by walking around your college or work that people enjoyed the first one and our hyped for the second movie. When I got to the theater i did not expect a crowd on Wednsday night but I got one. Then my friend told me ""Don't worry, its not all for transformers"". Then a group of girls passed by talking about transformers and sure enough it was sold out till 10 30. This movie was awesome and worth your 10 bucks."

If you are the casual, need to get constant refills on pop, movie goer and don't really pay that much attention to it you will be lost in 2 minutes. But, if you're a fan such as me and you love movies such as this then you will not be disappointed. Bay is a genius, way better than the last one with a lot more action and backstory. More robots than you can shake a stick at. The humor was a nice touch, a little excessive at times, but funny nonetheless."

The thing is that most people went to transformers 2 to see the fights, cars and explosions. Kids would love this movie. It may be dirty in some parts but 1. the kids wont understand or 2. they know what it is and they will laugh with you parents. Its not as bad as your making it out to be. Transformers was supposed to be about one thing ROBOTS FIGHTING!!!!! big shocker. I liked the explosions and fighting and i know the kids will because I was sitting next to about 7 kids(ages 5-8) and they loved every Transformer and explosion. the movie was made for the kids but Michael Bay put in a little humor for adults and teens. Your kids will love it I promise you. However, I cant say the same for the parents."

People seem to dislike the plot but I thought it was pretty good, nothing amazing, but not absolutely terrible. But seriously, this is a TRANSFORMERS movie, which after the first one (and definitely after this one) should be synonymous with action.

","Ever gone to a movie and somehow, that particular day you just couldn't get into it but maybe you saw it later and thought it was pretty good? I'm beginning to think the professional movie critics all saw ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" on a bad day. Even my favorite reviewer, Roger Ebert, whom I usually agree with 8 times out of 10, blew it on this one.<br/><br/>While this movie isn't perfect, it is far from the mish-mash of explosions and action reported by the critics.<br/><br/>This is Michael Bay (who has come a long way from ""Armageddon"")at his best and I'm beginning to think he is the new ""Master of Disaster"" in action and horror films, though one wonders what Irwin Allen would have done with CGI (rest in peace Irwin).<br/><br/>You want eye candy - explosions and destruction on a massive scale? Bay provides it. Digital sound effects that will rock your seat? Bay comes through. Action? Bay's best efforts yet. There's even story here if you go to the theater and look to be entertained instead of finding fault. How much of a story can you expect from a line of robot toys anyway? After all, this isn't Charles Dickens, Stephen King, or John Grisham and it isn't intended to be.<br/><br/>I had the pleasure of seeing this in an all digital theater and it was awesome - as good as the first film. I can only imagine the IMAX experience.<br/><br/>So, forget the critics. Go see this for what it's meant to be, pure entertainment.

Overall, the action was the best part of the movie with more robot time on screen and battles. Long movie, but there's so much more you can put into a film if there's more room.

I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. <br/><br/>The good: the effects (zowie!), better jokes and Sam's mom was hysterical. The ""twins"" also added some great humor. The bad: filming crews tend to forget that when they film with their backs to the sun, they can still be seen. In several scenes, you could see the film crew shadows. Also, in the opening scene, the action was so fast it was hard to tell who was who and it ended too quickly. The ending also screeched to a halt. It could have used a little more cool-down time. The ugly: I also took my two kids (8 and 6). There was, unfortunately, more language in this one and a lot more sexual jokes-- good thing the kids are too young to understand them. There was one scene that I had to cover their eyes because it was a little gross for them. But overall, they loved it.<br/><br/>Then I started talking to some people and some are calling it racist. Personally, I have no idea where they're getting that from. But you'll always find people who complain no matter what. These are probably the same people that said ""The Lion King"" was racist too. <br/><br/>This is a perfect summer flick: amazing effects, well-timed humor and characters you could feel for.

","Prior to Transformers (and, to a certain degree, The Island), Michael Bay seemed destined to be remembered as the director of a string of mindless, loud, critically lambasted blockbusters, plus Pearl Harbor (which was all of the above, only a lot more). Now, he's announced he won't direct the already announced Transformers 3, preferring to focus on smaller projects, and so he leaves the franchise with a sequel that looks scarily similar to his previous movies: dumb, excessive and (at least in the US) despised by critics. Sure, it is all of those things, but there's a big difference between Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and, say, Armageddon: this time, the good parts manage to largely outweigh the missteps.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the Kurtzman-Orci duo (aided by Transformers expert Ehren Kruger) aims to set up a complex mythology, as is to be expected with action and sci-fi sequels nowadays: the Fallen mentioned in the title isn't just an adjective related to the defeated Decepticons, it's also the name of a god-like Transformer (voiced by Tony ""Candyman"" Todd) who's up to no good and has been around for a long time. At about the same time as he decides to make his move, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is about to start college and trying to keep his relationship with Mikaela (Megan Fox) alive, but realizes the war between Autobots and Decepticons isn't over as far as he's concerned when he starts having spooky visions that could be of interest for the Fallen and the newly resurrected Megatron (Hugo Weaving). And so it's time for Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), Bumblebee, Ironhide and the other 'bots to help save the world. Again.<br/><br/>The first Transformers succeeded because it displayed a foolproof mix of action and humor, barring the final battle which was a bit OTT. It was a silly movie that was perfectly aware of its own silliness and turned that characteristic into an asset. And for about 90 minutes, it seems like Bay and the writers got that balance right the second time as well: one moment Optimus and Megatron kick the mechanical crap out of each other, the next Sam is trying to make sure his parents don't embarrass him or goofing around with John Turturro's disgraced - and shamefully underused - CIA agent (""What you're about to see is classified. Do not tell my mother.""). The laughs don't just come from the spot-on humans (Rainn Wilson's cameo is a blast), they come from the robots as well, as new entry Jetfire (Mark Ryan) eloquently (more or less) proves.<br/><br/>Then, all of a sudden, Bay drops the restraint in the third act: buildings blow up incessantly, slow-motion, smoke and dust are overused, the big Transformer battle goes on for ever and EVER, the mythology leaves room for every cliché in the manual and the silliness is blown way out of proportion (a close-up of a Decepticon's ""privates""? Really?). One might also wonder why the director bothered casting the animated series' original voice cast for the new robots (Ravage, Devastator, etc) when said machines are hastily introduced and then swiftly disposed (speaking of which, why come up with a Decepticon that looks human and drop the subplot after five minutes?).<br/><br/>And yet... and yet Revenge of the Fallen is a pretty decent piece of entertainment. Yes, it's loud and dumb in all the wrong ways past the 90-minute mark, and yes, Bay is obviously pandering to a certain audience's expectations by inserting clearly gratuitous slow-mo shots of Megan Fox running in a quite revealing outfit, but what the hell, he does all that with much more gusto, energy and willingness to amuse than he did in Pearl Harbor. If this truly is his last big movie (for the time being, at least), it is, in its own, weird way, a triumph."
"FelixMH","6","2","6","26 June 2009"," Just a bunch of gunfire and explosion!!
","There is nothing more to say about this awesome but also awful film. No logic, no plot. However, the special effects are amazing and extremely vivid.<br/><br/>But the action sequences are way too intense which gave the audiences a headache!<br/><br/>Gunfire, explosions, and the plot that doesn't make sense at all. This is a typical Micheal Bay film that I believe to be commercially successful.<br/><br/>Basically, this film follows the general course of the last Transformer movie. I am just wondering, why can't Micheal Bay be more intelligent on the plot rather than the over fired guns and explosives."
"jameslfitzgerald","7","2","6","26 June 2009"," Enjoyable but could and SHOULD have been better!
","I've just returned home from seeing the sequel to the awesome Transformers. Unfortunately it hasn't lived up to the hype for me as somewhere between the first and this they have forgotten their target audience.<br/><br/>It was disappointing for a few reasons: <br/><br/>1. There were several characters in this film that were clearly aimed for a much younger audience than the M15+ suggests. Whoever was responsible for the two 'brothers' who talk like they are in a Disney film should be taken outback and shot!! It RUINED the film as I found it impossible to become immersed in the story whenever they were in a scene. <br/><br/>2. One of the aspects of the first film that I loved was the dialogue used by the Decepticons which would be translated at the bottom of the screen. This was absent in the sequel which I found rather disappointing.<br/><br/>3. The degree of difficulty to kill an autobot/decepticon changed. In Transformers it required a massive effort to destroy one of these guys and suddenly it became much easier.<br/><br/>Things I liked: <br/><br/>1. The acting was really quite good in my opinion. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox were as good if not better than in the prequel. <br/><br/>2. The special effects were brilliant. Loved every minute of the action and was exactly what I had hoped for.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good film but had the potential to be great. I find it hard to understand why this film is only half a vote behind its prequel when they are miles apart."
"CaptainAmerica24","9","2","6","26 June 2009"," I Loved Soundwave!!!
","Ladies & Gentlmen all i can say is this is an awesome, entertaining film. Go watch it. Here are my pros & cons.<br/><br/>Pros: Optimus Prime was great. Shows why we all fell in love w/<br/><br/>this hero when we were kids. <br/><br/>Soundwave oh soundwave was awesome. When he sends ravage from space to earth was perfect!!!<br/><br/>Megatron & starcream dialogue was great...<br/><br/>Sideswipe as the corvette very sweet indeed.<br/><br/>The CGI was incredible.<br/><br/>Cons: The Twins were OK but the movie had no need for them. With so <br/><br/>many established autobots to pick from why create new ones?<br/><br/>They could of used hotrod, cliffjumper, hound, sunstreaker,<br/><br/>blaster to name a few. <br/><br/>Devastator was not the devastator i remember.<br/><br/>More Dialogue between autobots. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and go watch the film.

"redstimpy","Null","2","6","25 June 2009"," Wow that was bad
","Don't call this Bay guy one of the worst directors ever. That would make him ..distinct somehow. It's almost a compliment, you see. And don't call T2 ""Porn"" either! Hell, that's good stuff.<br/><br/>The first part literally made me sick. culminating with the girl hitting on FarretFace while in car and being sprayed with robot liquid. The dogs humping, the obnoxious parents, the same ""trouble around the house"" scene, the robot acting like a stray dog...every single minute was a torture. If i was to brainwash someone i would definitely use this part.<br/><br/>When you hear ""we have trouble"" several times, you know you won't care. You just wanna see something exciting and new, right? Wow do those bots sucked. Remember the cell phone robot from the first one? that was fun huh... Well, no fun scenes in this one. At all. No excitement whatsoever. Trust me. So the second part is like brain static. <br/><br/>Except for the racism. Two bots just like the Disney crows. downright shameful.<br/><br/>John Turturro, what can i say. The man is a miracle. his scenes are OK, for some reason his class, style and sheer presence makes them slightly pleasant..he pulls it off even here. But sir, stop acting in these. You can't be that hungry.<br/><br/>If you watched this and liked it, you deserve more."
"unspun01","7","2","6","25 June 2009"," I expected more...
","I really liked the first movie, but Transformers 2 was not what I expected at all. I couldn't explain it at first, but the movie lacked ""tension"". There is a lot of action, but no build up, and no sense of ""ominous danger"".<br/><br/>My most memorable part of the first movie was when the helicopter transformed and then destroyed the base in Qatar. Absolutely stunning! Lots of suspense, suspicion, and our first glimpse of a transformer and their capacity for destruction with cool CGI and wicked sound effects.<br/><br/>There are no memorable parts in this movie. All of the fights were the same - shot way too fast and no idea which robot was which. I hated the ""black"" ""gangsta"" lesser robots and they added absolutely nothing to the film. Not funny... Not in the original TV cartoon series...And not what I paid money to see.<br/><br/>On another note, Ramon Rodriguez who played the annoying roommate Leo was an absolute loser. A coward pansy and not remotely funny.<br/><br/>The artists should have drawn the transformers to look more ""simple"". I know they're a fictional race of advanced alien robots, but for all of the complex details, it is almost impossible to make out what the robots look like when standing still, let alone when they are twirling around in circles during a fight sequence.<br/><br/>Remember the cartoon? Exactly. All of us who grew up watching the TV series (and animated motion picture) as children can close our eyes and visualize what every transformer looks like. Try to close your eyes after this movie and see if you can picture ANY of them except Optimus Prime and BumbleBee...They all look the same! Megan Fox was gorgeous as usual, but I hoped to see more of her.<br/><br/>And what's with all of the ""never-before-heard-of"" transformers? The nameless Deceptacons that all looked the same and even the crappy motorcycle Autobots? Has anyone ever heard of them except the writers? Come on. I grew up watching the cartoon, and there are so many more well-known transformers that they could have used. Robots that people could say ""I remember that one"", or ""He was my favorite transformer"", or ""I owned that toy when I was a kid"". Who the hell were all of those ""geezer"" transformers? It was way too hard to follow the story because no one has ever frigging heard of those robots.<br/><br/>There were so many transformers thrown into this movie that it was impossible to gain any appreciation for them. If there were fewer robots with more screen time, people could pick their favorite (mine is ALWAYS Optimus Prime), or least favorite and feel some sort of compassion or aggression towards it. As it is, I felt no compelling reason to want my own guardian transformer parked in my garage.<br/><br/>I look forward to Transformers 3 but only if it reverts back to the same ""formula"" that made the first movie a big success. Bring back Jon Voight. Lose the unlikable sissy characters and ""gangsta"" robots. Drop some of the cheesy comedy. Simplfy the artistry. Reduce the number of robots. Don't link the president in a fictional movie to his actual name. If transformers have been here for so long, don't disguise them as a new Corvette concept vehicle or an Audi– pick a few older vehicles that resonate with a North American audience.<br/><br/>I like Michael Bay (The man knows how to make an action movie) but the reason I didn't enjoy this movie is because of the writers and the artists. The writers should rethink their writing and the artists should stop trying so hard and watch a few of the original TV shows...Just because this is fiction doesn't mean that they have to make it even more unbelievable. Destroy the sun? Crap..."
"jcgamesx","8","2","6","25 June 2009"," Boom Boom Pow
","This movie is definitely going to be a huge summer blockbuster box office hit. And it deserves that. Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is a solid sequel to (last years?) Transformers. Some might argue that it is even better. The movie has a good plot, and some solid acting, beautiful locations (Petra Ruins)and even throws in some comedy. Did I mention the special effects? This movie manages to squeeze in some massive explosions, and the robot-fights are phenomenal. My only problems were unoriginal thinking (the arch-nemesis is called Fallen) Why not call it the Revenge of Fallen, because not once did it refer to him as The Fallen, just Fallen. If you liked the original, you will love this movie. If you didn't then its probably not worth your time (being a almost 3hr movie) but the movie is surely worth the money. To sum it all up, the movie is a one of great quality and is sure to be as big as the robots in the film. 8/10"
"adrongardner","7","2","6","24 June 2009"," This ain't David Lean people, this is Transformers
","Michael Bay has finally found what was missing in all his other movies. He had the explosions. He had the military guys. He had the hugging and kissing shots of perfect looking people with the sun flare behind them.<br/><br/>But now he has giant robots shooting freaking laser beams at each other. His vision is complete.<br/><br/>Now I've read reviews and some of the criticisms are valid and others are just out of the park garbage. Its a miracle a movie series has been made of what was essentially a string of toy commercials. And I dare you to fire up an old episode of the series and tell me if any of what happens on screen makes any sense at all. Also, by simply buying a ticket to a movie called ""transformers"" you are preventing yourself from making any dramatic criticisms of this type of movie. It's like saying a roller-coaster is too bumpy. This isn't opera people. Revenge of the Fallen isn't art. This is a mega-budget B movie pornography of computer generated robot war. And its damn good at it too.<br/><br/>Was the story more thought out in the first movie? Yep. Does it run too long? Absolutely. Are some of the stereotypes out of place? Probably.<br/><br/>But Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was loud, vicious fun, very entertaining and I will be happy to line up and see it again."

","Boost the hydraulics, and bring your ear plugs! In the spirit of a monster truck rally held in a domed building, this superb movie has hard-hitting, non-stop action with plenty of volume, tough warrior guys, and gorgeous, but equally tough feminine fighters! What's not to like?!? Aside from a few specifics that can be overlooked, the plot is plausible, the character interaction is believable, and the acting itself it pretty good. At times the emotion draws you in though at others -- notably a few key plot spots -- events were pretty predictable resulting in less gut-wrenching impact than desired.<br/><br/>All-in-all though, this is a fantastic summer movie -- the one we've been waiting for!

"aga_zzi","8","2","6","24 June 2009"," Almost a perfect movie worth waiting for
","After being teased by revenge of the fallen's trailers, I was thinking of new sequel with full of impressive CG with crappy storyline again as what I get from watching the first Transformer movie. The only difference is that we may not really impressed on the second, since the elements of ""WOW"" already shown much at the first movie.<br/><br/>I watch the premiere of Revenge of the Fallen, and the whole of what I was saying on the first paragraph up there was wrong.<br/><br/>The movie still make me impressed. It still got the elements of humor everywhere, and the placement of the humor was great. <br/><br/>Autobots VS Decepticons fight scenes also almost dominate the whole 150 minutes of the movie. Although the elements of fighting still same like the first one, They were improved by mostly, by providing new Autobots and Decepticons on the screen, and giving new style of fight (e.g: when Optimus fighting 3 Deceptions alone, it still impressed me until the end of movie).<br/><br/>The greatest improvement of Revenge of The Fallen is how the storyline works. Although it was not perfect, complex, or dark story, but the storyline is enjoyable. I'm quite sure most of the watchers wouldn't go out from the cinema, and find out the end of movie was... ""Oh, Sam put the cube to Megatron chest, and Megatron died. Why Optimus not tell Sam to put the cube on Megatron's chest at the first place ? what a crappy story"".<br/><br/>Revenge of the Fallen is a great movie, but just like the others, This movie is not perfect one. <br/><br/>The jokes, although really entertaining, it seems that the jokes are kind of vulgar. Personally, I laughed at the jokes. The problem lies on Dads and Moms, who bring out their 5 or 10-years old child to watch bumblebee acts. It really should be like PG-13 or 18.<br/><br/>The biggest mistake of this movie lies on the CG for the robots. Somehow, you'll find out that the robots' body are not ""clean"" enough, compared with the Autobots or Decepticons on the first movie. I won't show detailed on what scene the ""unclean animation"" occurs, but you have to watch for yourself to find out. They are seems to looked very clear on the screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I would vote for 8/10. It would be one of my perfect movie of this season, if only they have more time to clean up the CG Robots to be ""looked real"" just like on the first one. <br/><br/>""there's more to them than meets the eye"" - (Quotes by: Optimus Prime, Transformer)"
"Burnoutsss","7","2","6","24 June 2009"," Michael Bay makes a serviceable film. Dumb, but fun.
","Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Has any other name been as synonymous with big Hollywood productions besides Jerry Bruckheimer? He has been known for his legendary special effects as well as his utter lack of human traits in a film. If there was ever a classic example of preferring style over substance, look no further than Bay himself.<br/><br/>Thus, imagine the surprise many felt when they actually admitted to liking Bay's Transformers. While his critics were still present, he had actually received several praises from several thousand fan boys and was green-lit to do a sequel.<br/><br/>The plot starts off much later after the initial Decepticon encounter. Literally. Apparently at 17,000 B.C., there were also giant robots raging war with our ancestors. In the present, however, the U.S. military and the Autobots combine together to form NEST, a secret force made in order to defeat incoming Decepticons. However, after a messy battle, the military has had it. They want the Autobots to either cooperate or leave. Elsewhere, Sam Witwicky (Shia Lebeouf), leaves for college and tries to have a 'normal' life. Of course, when he accidentally touches a cube fragment, he sees symbols, thus destroying his wishes altogether.<br/><br/>To be honest, with the exception of the giant opening battle, I found the First Act a bit of a bore. It's ironic because in the first Transformers, I found the First Act the strongest. It really had a sort of human connection with me that struck me the right way. However here, it has all these messy subplots which I didn't really care about. Like Sam's relationship problems, for example. It's the typical long distance troubles and new hot girl that really didn't interest me. I also didn't particularly care for the in-fighting of the Autobots vs. the U.S. Government. It's sort of that expected feeling you get from a sequel.<br/><br/>Luckily, the rest of the movie follows up to what passes for an entertaining popcorn movie.<br/><br/>All the vices of Bay's film work are here: the shaky camera, the 360 camera, the explosions, the loud noises, the heavy editing and of course, boyish humor. And just like the last Transformers, Bay always had to refer to one of his earlier works.<br/><br/>What really brings the movie out are its actors. While the characters they play are a bit bland, they are given a lot of screen time and a lot of situations to express their acting range. Shia Lebeouf is as strong as ever as well as Peter Cullen as the infamous Optimus Prime. John Tanaturo is hilarious again, but credit should go to newcomer Ramon Rodriguez as Sam's roommate, Leo. He has some bright charm to him that compliments Shia's acting.<br/><br/>The robots in the film are given a similar treatment in the first film. While Bumblebee and Optimus are given sufficient screen time, the rest of the Autobots don't really have that luxury. Add in the fact, that there are even more Autobots than prior, and you have a problem.<br/><br/>An odd note I'd like to comment on is the Megatron/Starscream interaction. In the original cartoon, Starscream made it no secret that he wanted to overthrow Megatron and lead the Decepticons. Hell, he even tried to kill Megatron a couple of times. But in the movie, Starscreams kind of a coward, and begs at Megatron's feet. I kind of wished that Starscream would've back stabbed him, but oh well.<br/><br/>The action of the movie is intense. If you ever find yourself lacking a reason to go see a film, just go for pure eye-candy alone. The battles are on a large scale, and bigger than ever. Contrary to what a lot of people said, I could keep track with all the action on the screen. Perhaps it was the color scheme, but I found myself engaged with a lot of the battles, and knew who was winning and who was losing.<br/><br/>The humor is questionable to say the least. A large part of the movie is comedy and it comes from all directions. From speech to slapstick, there's humor to be found everywhere. Some of it works, such as slapstick from Rodrigez's part. Some of it is crass, like a robot dry humping Megan Fox. And some is just plain painful. There are two robots who are twins. Whether they are offensive Mexican Stereotypes or Black Stereotypes, doesn't matter to me. I just want them gone.<br/><br/>In the end, you go in hating this film, you'll hate this film. If you go in liking this film, you'll like it. It's just another one of Bay's works that will appeal to a certain audience. The plot is serviceable enough, though with plenty of holes, to get us through and there are good moments as well as painful moments. In the end, I liked it just fine.<br/><br/>Verdict: Go see it."
"Sinthetic211","7","2","6","24 June 2009"," Unbalanced, yet isn't this what we asked for?
","When the first movie released the reviews were great, some were bad but more than anything the most recurring ""flaw"" so to say was there wasn't enough Transformers screen time. Well, we got it... 2 1/2 of almost literally all action and Transformers scenes. I am not exaggerating when I say there are probably less than 10 scenes in this movie without a Transformer in it. Though the thought of 2 1/2 of pure Transformers action may seem appealing at first... I'll be the first to say it can become mind-numbing. Also, I must add that I am a HUGE Transformers fan and even for someone like me this became almost redundant. Overall this movie is quite good though, but 2 1/2 hours is just too much and that's what drives it down from an 8 to a 7 for me. It's 4:11am I just got back from the movie I'm not completely coherent so please forgive me. I should have waited to do this but I felt the urge to do it ASAP.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: This movie is like the counter weight of the first movie and together they balance each other out quite well. The first movie focused more on us, the humans, and our reactions and actions to toward the Transformers. In this movie the main focus by far is the Transformers. Little explanation involved in this one.. almost all action with a little comedy and slight drama thrown in. This movie could not stand alone without the first movie which isn't a bad thing though. I like that Bay used the first movie as the entire foundation for an action packed sequel so he would not have a need to explain anything the second time around. All in all this movie is definitely worth seeing just make sure you have seen the first movie and make sure you are prepared for 2 1/2 hours of pure action!"
"tilenperko","6","2","6","23 June 2009"," It is like Holly Sh...!!!.....in a good way & in a bad way!
","The film was good, especially because I watched it 14 hours before the premiere, in an empty cinema where I work. I was really excited to watch this movies, since the first trailer came out. <br/><br/>Everything in this movie was good, awesome, nice, cool etc...the acting was good and the action between the robots is spectacular, but this it is where it gets complicated. <br/><br/>I am a little of director myself, so I watch movies maybe a little different. The camera in actions sequences is too close and moves too fast when the robots are fighting. And the robots move too fast, when in battle. For example: when Optimus fights Megatron, Starscream and Blackout in the forest I couldn't see almost nothing, because they were moving too fast and the camera was too close too them. Good thing that Optimus is in red and blue colors'cause if he wouldn't be, I wouldn't tell the difference between them. <br/><br/>Too close and too fast camera in this movie, especially in fight scenes. But this is a habit that Michael Bay has and is famous for. <br/><br/>Althou, good movie, work watching, animation kicks ass! Greetings from Slovenia, Tilen Perko - Anhilator"
"jmurph3","7","2","6","23 June 2009"," Good, not great, but still loved it
","Let's be honest with ourselves - if you're going to see Transformers expecting a stellar plot with well developed characters and stunning dialogue, you're in the wrong place. Going to see Transformers for the movie quality is a bit like going to see Star Wars for the dialogue - you know that you're just going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>Yes, the dialogue was weak. Yes, parts of the movie dragged on a bit. I personally thought that there was a distinct disconnect between the first part of the movie (Sam going to college), and the second part of the movie (action scenes). The plot itself was so/so, but in parts was drawn out so much that it got a bit tedious, and tedious and Transformers are words that do not belong in the same sentence.<br/><br/>That being said, it was still a fabulous movie. Gorgeous special effects, even better than last time, and loads of new Transformers, which was especially fun. This movie was meant to be entertaining, and entertaining it certainly was. New characters and old characters combined with spectacular special effects were what made this movie worthwhile.<br/><br/>So ignore the reviews that decry how terrible this movie is. If you liked the first Transformers, you will like this one. If you thought the first Transformers was swill, this will be swill as well. All in all, a good movie, a good sequel, and well worth going to see for the entertainment of it."
"jangomac72","8","2","6","20 June 2009"," Should've been better
","Michael Bay's sequel to the 2007 smash hit based on Hasbro's best selling toy line is a mixed affair.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime and his fellow Autobots now work with a US Military Task Force called NEST in hunting down rogue Decepticons whilst reluctant hero Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) finds himself leaving home and his girlfriend (Megan Fox) for college.<br/><br/>Whilst the first film was in no doubt a Michael Bay film, you always got the sense that the guiding hand of Executive Producer Steven Spielberg had been predominant throughout its production, Bay's excesses were toned down and focus was put on the story and the characters. Unfortunately I got the feeling whilst watching Revenge of the Fallen that Spielberg took a less ""hands on"" role for the sequel.<br/><br/>This is a Michael Bay film through and through, there's no escaping that. Loud explosions, slow-mo action scenes, shots filmed from the ground staring upwards to an orange tinged sky, all his traits and clichés are here, not to mention the obscene amount of gratuitous shots of the US Military that borders on the pornographic by the films conclusion (I'm almost convinced that if you took out half of the shots devoted to glorifying them, the film would be a good 15 minutes shorter) It's because of Bay's excesses that this film is a mess. There is a good story in here, somewhere, but it's surrounded by so much bombast and flag waving bravado that it really does leave a bitter taste in the mouth when the film (finally!) finishes. Not only that, I was quite amazed at the amount of swearing and sexual references in the film. I'm definitely no prude, but come guys, this is, essentially, a kids film that will be watched by a huge amount of 6-7 years olds. What's wrong with some good old fashioned PG entertainment?!? Besides that, the two main misfires are, for a film where the main villain is mentioned in the title, he's quite conspicuous by his absence. The Fallen could've been Palpaptine to Megatron's Vader but the dynamic and relationship are so poorly conceived and written that you still don't really have a clue what either have been doing or have been up to, rather than they want to destroy Earth's Sun.<br/><br/>The sheer amount of new Transformers is also confusing. I'm all for going bigger and better in sequels but here, there are just too many of them to keep track of. So many new Autobots and Decepticons are introduced that they just end up being faceless (and under written) robots. One of the things that the first film got right is that you had a core base of 5 autobots that were fully fleshed out, had definitive characters and most importantly, you cared about. Here, with several more thrown into the mix, you just don't give a monkeys! I'm not even going to mention the Twins, Mudflap and Skids. Jeez, what were they thinking?!? (Honestly if people thought Jar Jar Binks was racist, they're going to have a field day with these two!) There are some good points, it's not all bad. The first hour is very good and up there with the first film. Shia and Megan (especially Megan ) are great on screen and always watchable, there's the right amount of mystery and action in that first hour (the college Decepticon attack is a great stand out scene and is reminiscent of something from the Terminator franchise) but the film really suffers once, spoilers ahoy! - Optimus Prime meets his death in a terrific forest set action sequence.<br/><br/>From that point onwards, it's as if the film loses its heart and soul and just becomes another cynical overblown Hollywood product. The film only really recovers once, there go those spoilers again! - Optimus Prime is resurrected.<br/><br/>But by that point, it's too late, the damage has been done and you've given up caring.<br/><br/>There is a good film in here, somewhere. Trim out the worst excesses of Bay's film-making, lose at least 30 minutes of the running time, get rid of the awful Twins and you would have a film that is as good, or if not better than, the first film. However it seems as if being better equals bigger and longer in Hollywood today when, in some cases, the reverse is true. 7.5/10 (and I'm being generous, that's for the first hour, Optimus Prime and all those scenes of Megan Fox running)"

","Michael Bay has always been known as a filmmaker who puts style over substance. While it worked to a certain extent with the first entry in the Transformers franchise, which was an enjoyable summer blockbuster, this follow-up doesn't add anything remotely new to the series.<br/><br/>At 2 hours and 30 minutes, the movie is far too long. The extended action scenes stretch the thin plot out much longer than it has any right to be. The final battle in Egypt lasts approximately 45 minutes, and long before it reaches its climax, I had become numb to the explosions and destruction. Given that there is no time spent worrying about the thousands of civilian casualties incurred over the film's runtime, the action throughout feels weightless and dull.<br/><br/>Almost every character in the movie is hugely unlikeable. Both Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox's characters return, and they have become even less interesting than the previous film. They are unsympathetic leads who lack any chemistry. The movie briefly attempts to involve these characters in an awful love triangle, but it is quickly dropped, having next to no impact on their relationship.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they are not helped by the supporting cast, with a majority of them also being extremely annoying, including Sam's parents, his college roommate, Leo, and new robot characters Mudflap and Skids. John Turturro attempts to add some energy when he appears, but unfortunately, he cannot do much with the awful script. Each of these side characters seems to be in the movie with the sole purpose of being comedic relief, but unfortunately, the humour falls flat consistently.<br/><br/>The whole movie left me feeling cold and empty. The ""deaths"" of both Sam and Optimus Prime did not feel remotely impactful or sad simply because you don't care enough about any of the characters. Given that these are two primary characters in the franchise, these should be huge, shocking moments, but unfortunately, they are forgettable.<br/><br/>The only redeeming factor of this movie is the spectacle. The special effects and production are superb and still hold up a decade after the film was released. The overall one-note villains were given as a small bit of versatility with the addition of new characters Ravage and Devastator, whose cool visual design distinguished one CGI robot from the other."

"sam_smithreview","6","1","2","28 May 2016"," The start of the slope of bad Bay films
","This film is arguably the most highly anticipated release of the summer, and you can see the pressure must have got to Michael Bay with the amount of crap he put into this movie to lengthen it.<br/><br/>Firstly, i will say the action scenes and visual effects are great, and the addition of new ""hip"" auto-bots is good for young viewers (not anyone else though), but unfortunately you only really see any action until the last half, and then its still separated by unnecessary and tiresome romantic scenes, and even then, the action scenes become tiresome with large amounts of 300 style slow-mo and an obvious intention of Michael Bay to show everyone how great his visual effects are.<br/><br/>The first half is largely made up of useless footage of Sam at college and annoyingly frequent comedy scenes with his mum. The whole ""college"" section could have been compressed to about 20 to 25 minutes rather than an hour long, which have no impact on the story as a whole.<br/><br/>The plot is not very good, and the stuff about the fallen is pretty gnarly. Its just a shame you don't find out about it till about the last third of the film, and there are a lot of plot holes - like why the hell didn't Sam give the splinter to Optimus Prime instead of his lame girlfriend?! But i think if they had started with the plot earlier and cut a lot of the ""in-between"" they could have made the film a lot more fun.<br/><br/>Overall, it was fun, but the faults become tiresome and therefore make the film less entertaining and some what boring at times, especially with its long length (2 and a half hours i believe). Worth Seeing yes, but definitely not the blockbuster monstrosity we were all looking forward to."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","6","1","2","30 December 2012"," Lacks traits of its predecessor
","The first transformers film had a lot going for it. It's music, action, special effects and acting were all exceptional. But as for this sequel, it seems like the tone of the film needed to be changed. Transformers (2007) had realistic tone, every now and then it would inject some silly humor but that was to let its audience know that there was room for some laughs. But for Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009), it was decided that more comedy and slapstick was needed. But for what reason?<br/><br/>For the most part, every component was kept relatively the same as the first. Some of the statement is good, while the other part, not so much. What's good are the special effects action and music. The transforming sounds are still there, as are the visuals and the explosive action. Even Steve Jablonsky returned to make a musical soundtrack for the film. What went wrong here was character placement and how that effected the tone.<br/><br/>Megan Fox and Shia LaBeouf both reprised their roles as the popular couple, Mikaela and Sam. However, as I mentioned in the first review of this franchise, I would only forgive Mr. Witwicky for being so jittery because it was his first time being around alien robots. What do we have here? Mr. Witwicky is still jittery AND now he's screaming like a woos. Half of the running time in this film Shia LaBeouf is screaming. Even Megan Fox's character screams less than him. Enough with it LaBeouf! Did you ask to have a script with little dialog so you didn't talk much? He should be used to this kind of thing now.<br/><br/>Then there's the character placement of Simmons (John Turturro). Turturro played a supporting character in the first film and now he's been moved to head honcho/plot motivator. Why do that? Some of Turturro's lines are really ridiculous or worse, inappropriate. This was supposed to add to the comical scenes but I didn't find very funny. Plus, writer Ehren Kruger thought it would be fun to pen in some loud- mouthed autobots as well. Yeah they weren't needed either. <br/><br/>I enjoyed more of Mark Ryan's performance as the decrepit decepticon, Jetfire. It reminded me of the senior citizens of our time. For nostalgia purposes. And for the rest of the voice actors, they all return as well. Even Frank Welker is here this time, which was a nice addition. But again, all these good things can't override the abundant silly slapstick that is placed in this film. It needs to be toned down again.<br/><br/>To make the film more attractive, it was thought that by adding more slapstick would increase the films likability. To be honest, it just made it more stupid including LaBeouf's role. The rest is fine though which isn't much."

","I am not about to write a review of this movie as most of what I feel has already been mentioned over and over in previous reviews. I am only going to say that they tried way, way too hard to be funny. Creating auto-bots that talk and act like they are from the hood killed everything. I couldn't count how many times I rolled my eyes and groaned and the lame jokes and slapstick comedy.<br/><br/>I had the fortune to be in Chicago recently and watch them film scenes for the upcoming Transformers 3 and I have to say it looked pretty good. However, if the script is as cheesy as the first two Transformers, I will be sure to pass, including passing on watching it on DVD."
"blacklist-1","1","3","12","6 October 2009"," The worst sequel (and in general) film I have ever seen.
","At last it's great to know that I'm not the only person who thinks Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a terrible movie. Those who previewed this film as awful or close to it actually have sense whilst those who loved it...well that's your choice.<br/><br/>Micheal Bay as it goes for an incompetent director has to be one of the worst. Despite the overwhelming evidence from fans of the first film, action fans or just anyone else who happened too see this on this website that this sequel is utterly crap and that it was a flop with film critics. Bay says he dosen't care what anyone else thinks.<br/><br/>This attitude he has displayed reveals everything about his character and the way this film has been portrayed.This sequel has made millions and has become one of the summer's biggest hits but it shouldn't be.<br/><br/>The first one was brilliant with a clear story, decent enough acting with character development and a chance to see what was happening on screen. One big problem being the first of many is that target market the demographics are aiming is contradictory.<br/><br/>For example Bay has claimed this is a family film, yet it's full of sexual innuendo like a small bot humping Megan Foxes leg, a female in disguise as a Decepticon if that is the right name has a tail come out of her arse and Fox herself with her boobs swaying as she runs.<br/><br/>And this is meant to be for teenagers? Frankly it's degrading, insulting in particular for women and downright shallow, which brings me to this film's second cock up no character development.<br/><br/>The script is a sham Megan Fox has nothing to say or do apart from running away from pointless explosions except to be a piece of eye candy. Whilst Shia LaBeouf who made the most of his part and whose acting was solid enough was stuck between a rock and a hard place. There was no chemistry between him and Fox. The idea when he says he loves her was nauseating. Meanwhile all the other characters like Sam Witwicky's parent's and the auto-bots including two sidekicks were there to provide comic relief unfortunately all they gave me was one massive headache and feelings total frustration with old, recycled and lame jokes.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started with the camera-work, all over the place. Action sequences are meant to be entertaining but it's impossible to enjoy if you can't see what's going on, bots stomping about and explosions not knowing what bot was on whose side as I just didn't care.<br/><br/>The editing is atrocious of where Fox arrives in Egypt likes she's in Paris one moment and bang she's now in Egypt as were several other parts which I can't be bothered to go into.<br/><br/>The plot though thin in itself and very simple just dragged on forever making this two and a half hours, it was barely tolerable after the first hour.<br/><br/>In th end Bay comes off to me as an arrogant man who just loves to make money. He shouldn't be allowed to make movies and I was astounded to learn that Steven Spielburg even took part in this film! Bay must have drugged him.<br/><br/>In the end I just came out extremely disappointed and frustrated with one big headache. Now wheres the paracetamol?"

"malachi490","3","2","7","2 September 2013"," Why this movie sucks in a nutshell.
","OK lets start with the very noticeable and easy basics of why this movie failed. <br/><br/>A. No plot.... Ignore even the ""useless romantic part"" and it still is meshed together filler and explosions. <br/><br/>B. Title alone kills this movie. When you put your main villains name in a title he should be a big deal. I notice I'm the only person who see's why this made the movie suck. The title is ""Transformers: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN"" SO how much screen time dose this big bady get.... I honestly don't know for sure but it feels like 10 minutes total stretched through out the film. All of which spans out this look of ""The Fallen"" being a total bad ass you don't mess with but when the finale fight scene comes.... It feels like its 20 secs long Prime pretty much walks up and bitch slaps him in two hits and rips his face in half then pan to Prime giving the exact same speech he did at the end of the first film and fade to credits.... I mean thats just sh** Plot and no way for an audience to relate. <br/><br/>C. My finale reason this movie failed and a firm belief I hold about the director period. Michael Bay can not Direct! Sure I'm a nobody and he makes millions so what do I know. I know I'm the consumer among millions of other consumers who make or break the careers of those with fame and who make movies. Fact is in my opinion Bay is a over payed child who has no real talent or skill and relies on big booms and crashes. He is easily amused and most of what he makes is well.. Garbage unless the talent of an actor can save it. In the case of these movies no hope! His stuff is as simple as you seen it once you seen it all. Lots of bangs, American flags in the background, and heavy us of our armed forces to show his support (Commendable but pathetically old and over done by him)."
"clouseau-4","3","2","7","16 February 2012"," I was stunned at how awful thus movie was
","Explanation of the 3 stars instead of 1: the robot CGI, special effects, sound effects and sound editing were all excellent. Kudos to the technical department for their work, it was flawless.<br/><br/>You know how certain kinds of pain are horrible in totally different ways? A really bad toothache is a different kind of awful pain than getting kicked in the balls (I'm sure there is a lady equivalent but I can only speak for my own gender on this subject).<br/><br/>Watching this movie was like discovering a new, different kind of pain that's horrible on a new special level. I've seen bad movies before, but this film just stunned me in its utter contempt for the art of making a film.<br/><br/>There is no coherent plot or structure of any kind, characters just whiz around the globe for the flimsiest of reasons. New artifacts and concepts are introduced and discarded haphazardly and constantly throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The motivation of every character is bizarre to the point of being surreal. This kind of conversation happened at least 3 times in the movie:<br/><br/>Person in position of authority (admiral,colonel,etc.): Wait, you want me just to drop everything, ignore all my rules and procedures, and just do what you say even though it makes no sense whatsoever? Transformers character: Yes. Person in position of authority: OK, I'll do whatever you tell me to do.<br/><br/>The whole movie feels like a series of CGI action scenes just strung together in whatever sequence was convenient. I can't remember seeing a movie where in EVERY scene something utterly illogical is going on.<br/><br/>This film takes the ""battling robots take a cigarette break whenever main characters talk"" concept from the original movie and abuses it over and over again. You'll be watching this overly long conversation between Sam and some other character and start wondering, hey wait, isn't there a battle going on around them? Why did it stop? Decepticon union regulations?<br/><br/>These robots are super fast and can outrun any human and yet they can't catch Sam in open desert territory, or hit him with a weapon, even after they have had almost an hour of being right on TOP OF HIM.<br/><br/>There's even an inside joke when the characters are searching for alien technology inside Egyptian ruins (""archaeologists have been all through this, what makes you think we'll find anything?""). Ha ha ha archaeologists can't find stuff that's right in front of their face.<br/><br/>I lost count of how many troops were killed in this movie, it must have been well over 1,000 if you count the number of tanks, planes, ground troops, etc., that were wiped out. But in the end, it's all feel good wonderful with no sense of loss whatsoever. That's another problem with the movie: there's absolutely no consequence of ANY action in the movie. If anyone or anything dies, it's ignored. When it is some character you're supposed to care about, they'll be fixed in some magic way right away and be back in the movie. The movie gives the viewer nothing and no one to care about. Compare that to a movie like Up, where you make an emotional connection to the main character almost immediately and it's a cartoon!<br/><br/>I guess the humans must have beefed up their weaponry since the first film, since their weapons seem to actually affect the robots this time around. Barely. You'd think soldiers would be smart enough not to bother using ineffective weapons against an enemy since that's pointless. Apparently, all the soldiers in this film come from the Lemming division. Getting decimated by the Decepticons makes them only more eager to suicidally attack; are these US soldiers or Al Queda?<br/><br/>This movie makes Star Wars: Episode I look like the The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. I read one review that summed it up well: This is the movie Ed Wood would make if he had ILM and a $200 million budget."
"Leofwine_draca","4","2","7","11 October 2011"," Long, loud and irrelevant
","The second TRANSFORMERS film turns out to be just as uninteresting as the first film, which will surprise nobody. Michael Bay seems obsessed with making each film 'bigger' than his last, and it feels like REVENGE OF THE FALLEN attempts to cram in twice as much stuff as in the first film. There's military stuff, with soldiers and helicopters, there's globe-trotting adventure stuff, and, of course, there's a great deal of massive robots beating the hell out of each other.<br/><br/>Despite the massive budget and the copious amounts of on-screen destruction, this is a dull film and you feel every minute tick by as you watch it play out. That's because the human story is awful. Mr Devoid-of-charisma himself, Shia LaBeouf, is back and entertaining nobody with his tired 'college kid' schtick: whether he's running away from explosions, screaming like a girl or engaging in supposed comic routines with his extremely irritating mother, he sucks energy from this movie. The supporting cast are also vapid, none more so than blow-up doll lookalike Megan Fox.<br/><br/>Now, as a kid I used to enjoy playing with transformers toys. I admit, the thought of watching massive robots fighting each other does sound fun, in the way the goofy old kaiju movies with Godzilla battling King Kong and the like are still enjoyable even today. I'll admit that the CGI effects in this movie are excellent – you never question the destruction for a second. But even watching transformers fight gets boring, especially when the movie starts with a full blown climatic battle (ever heard of build-up, Bay?), features tons of samey action, and ends with a pitched battle that lasts for around an hour. Too much of the fighting just consists of blurry close-ups, these robots are so big, and I wish Bay had taken more effort to bring his camera back a bit and keep it still for a while. He doesn't, and the film exemplifies all that's wrong with Hollywood blockbusters as a result, even if it is superficially entertaining in places."
"smithtrio","4","2","7","10 September 2011"," Had its moments, but the moments were standard.
","Okay, so Transformers 2 was my least favorite of the films. That's to put it simply. Honestly I don't like almost any of Michael Bay's films, other than the first Transformers and The Island. But the problem with this is more of the plot, characters, and, well, just about everything except for the perfect mix of childhood nostalgia and bad-ass action, along with very intricate special effects. That's all I give it credit for. Movies are a lot like telling a story. If someone was telling you a story, do you want him or her to constantly make explosions with their mouth, flinging spit everywhere? No, you wouldn't. You would want a story where the plot is compelling, the characters you can relate to but still have character, and a satisfying ending. This depends, of course, on the viewer, so I can't really blame you for thinking a little bit differently. I read a review that basically said that if you aren't the target audience, then you won't like it. I've totally lost my faith in humanity since the target audience is most of America, an impressionable, ""this movie was good because of the effects"" bunch. All in all, this movie had it's moments. Unfortunately, those moments were so subtle and so standard that the rest of the mess stands out like a sore thumb.

Just for the sake of effects. And then for the love of God, more effects. Stir. Vomit.<br/><br/>Michael Bay directs TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, the fantastically stupid sequel to TRANSFORMERS (2007).<br/><br/>Writers Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman and Ehren Kruger pile unnecessary complicated backstory on unnecessary complicated backstory, piled on juggernaut computer action that makes our optic nerves jigger like topless dancers in an earthquake.<br/><br/>Sam (Shia LeBeouf, still giving it his best Jerry Lewis meets Ben Stiller) is now in college. His girlfriend, Mikaela (Megan Fox) is still a whore (we meet her as she's lubing up, doggie kneeling over the seat of a motorbike, airbrushing the fuel tank, which I'm sure is the prescribed position to achieve the best Frank Frazetta effect). His parents are still kvetching Kevin Dunn and Julie White. And, like every nerd, his best friends are still robots from outer space.<br/><br/>(By the way, how does Megan Fox feel, knowing that the girl who pursues Sam in college (Isabel Lucas) is hotter than her, with the same fluttering do-me eyes, the same pert breasts, the same cupid bow lips, red as a baboon vagina in estrus, arcing over nubile wet mouth? How does it make bighead Fox feel to know that spinners like her litter campuses across America? And without toe-thumbs!...) <br/><br/>The Autobots, led by drama queen Optimus Prime (still trying to rasp like Clint Eastwood) are now aiding the American military in their battle against Decepticons (the bad robots, whom we know are bad because they're all trying to rasp like Gozer from GHOSTBUSTERS).<br/><br/>A shred of the McGuffin from the last movie - the All-Spark crystal - becomes the McGuffin for this movie. But the writers cannily transfer the crystal's mechanics into Sam's brain (because as it is, we could hardly care less about the crystal, not that we care that much more about Sam), so HE can be the target of the Decepticons, led by a robot named The Fallen. Made even scarier by his name being an adjective.<br/><br/>Story is structured along the same lines as a George Lucas tale (i.e. they make it up as they go along), and never have I seen a movie with so many explosions with nothing happening.<br/><br/>Suddenly - just like the last movie, in the midst of raping our optical lobe - John Turturro as paranoid Agent Simmons again! Raises the funny level. Mildly. Then, in a movie filled with unnecessary visuals - the John Turturro buffalo shot. And I'm not saying his thonged ass is not a beautiful thing, I'm just sayin'...<br/><br/>They're robots - shouldn't they be fighting with viruses online, rather than pushing each other? Why do they blink? How come none of them can aim? These technologically superior behemoths have Faster-Than-Light travel, targeting mechanisms and rocket launchers built into their forearms; I mean, how many rounds can they possibly fire without hitting a damn thing? <br/><br/>Starscream is a JET with ROCKET LAUNCHERS and he can't shoot down Sam, because apparently Sam is such a good hider - amongst Egyptian huts so volatile, one bullet causes them to explode like gas stations. Guess Starscream can't keep up with the editor's lack of continuity jump cuts - oh, a nice slow motion shot of Megan's bouncing boobies - so why don't the tigerbots scour the huts and find Sam?; what is the purpose of those tiny mini-me-bots except to annoy me?; then Simmons is climbing Khafre's Pyramid near the giant Decepticon, calling a naval vessel to unleash a classified weapon on it - but why is he in the target area? Apparently so he could crack the 13-year-old mentality scrotum joke... <br/><br/>You lost me at ophthalmologist.<br/><br/>It is no secret this movie's target demo is 13 year old boys. But the movie makes no attempt to hide the fact that the American military are also arrested development 13-year-olds. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson reprise their roles as military guys in denial that their bullets are useless. They talk real tough to impress 13-year-old boys and keep firing.<br/><br/>If the Transformers were not so radically detailed, I wouldn't be in so much pain. If they looked like the Hasbro toys they were inspired by, they would be cool, streamlined giant robots. Instead, the on screen designers try to melt the vitreous gel in our eyeballs with more mechanical ganglion than the human eye could possibly digest.<br/><br/>A Blackbird jet transforms into an old geezer who insists on giving us more illogical backstory about the Original Gangstas - the Primes who came to Earth during caveman times who turned into rocks to protect a magical Spear of Destiny and then ate Little Red Riding Hood. Or something.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron, but is resurrected with some magic dust that reconstitutes itself into the Spear of Destiny that Sam stabs into his chest. Just like Jesus, except more believable. Then he pimps his ride with some hardware from the Blackbird and conjugates the adjective robot.<br/><br/>Isn't it great when a deus ex machina plan comes together with magic? But we can't see anything because it's all just a mash of mechanical CGI. I hope the good guys won. Megan Fox's boobies seem to be okay. That's all that matters to 13-year-old boys."

","I think this was an abomination. First off, why have so much sexual references in a movie that is based off of a kids show? Why have so much language either? Do not get me started on the two stupid twins. Also tell me how the character development in this movie is terrible. This movie is called Revenge of the Fallen right? Why is the fallen barely in it? You do not see him until almost an hour into the movie. This movie is basically about Sam once again, I thought it was called Transformers not the life of Sam Witwicky. There was a scene in the movie where a few decepticons resurrect Megatron and as soon as he comes back to life, he flies up into space to this other planet which is unknown within 5 seconds if even that. Optimus Prime get's killed and doesn't come back until the end, then he kills the Fallen within a couple of minutes, so why is it called Revenge of the Fallen? He didn't even accomplish anything in this movie, why did Bay rush the fight, why did he kill him off so quickly, he could've saved the Fallen's death until the next movie at least. This movie is so bad that I've actually seen Bonecrusher in this movie once again, but didn't Prime kill him in the first movie, his head was torn clean off. Megatron did not ever mention anything about the Fallen in the first movie, so he just came out of the blue. There is no good plot, no character development, lots of sexual references, cursing here and there, this movie should be rated R because we all known kids went to see this movie, and guess what they get when they do. Michael Bay should have never been the director for Transformers period. The two things I can say good about this movie, is the action scenes, and the CGI, but hey I guess that's all Bay is good for."

The direction is so annoying it almost becomes unbearable. The people that wrote the script to this must have not given any thought, because the plot and direction is very terrible. This movie is a insult to the audiences viewing it, it was sad to hear couple of my friends say this is a enjoyable movie when we saw it in theater. There was just way too many plot holes in this movie and the plot holes become so annoying because they are too obvious and there are a lot of them in this. Sequels tend to suck but this movie has no excuse, it had a huge budget and there was almost no thought that was gone into writing a good or even a decent script. The build up, climax and conclusion was all terribly done. The reason I am giving this movie a 4 is because of few of the good fight sequences. I give zero credit to Micheal Bay for this but only to the people that worked on the special effects. I could care less about Shia LaBeouf character in this and Megan Fox was just there to make the male audience drool over, she has become a sex symbol. Micheal Bay literally decided to go Micheal Baywatch with her in this. Some people that liked this movie a lot might say ""turn your brain off while watching this"" and even goes as far as to bash on people that give the right review and make legit negative criticism. After watching this horrendous piece of crap movie it seems those people had a major brain damage before or after watching this flick. This movie is most definitely a pass, but to anyone that really want to check this out, just skip to the robot battle sequences. It don't matter how big of a fan Linkin Park is of of the Transformers, it's sad to hear there music is played for this garbage, not that there new stuff is great or anything like that. The special effects was good and I give props to the team that worked on it, but no credit will go to Micheal Bay for this. The action sequences should be a part of a movie for these type of genre, but for this one that is the only thing that just slightly saves this movie from just getting a 1 for me.<br/><br/>4/10"
"bennyhagen","3","2","7","20 June 2011"," Finally Bay has lost it
","I really liked the first movie and actually gave it a 9 star rating. Undoubtedly it was a Michael Bay vehicle too, but there he kind of had his s*it together, so the whole thing was bearable while you actually had some time to take in the effects. Now this is the same stuff but with Bay directing it on a pound of cocaine while having an epileptic seizure, it's a catastrophe.<br/><br/>The plot is a logic paradox, the cinematography is confusing, everything is constantly spinning and/or exploding. The audio is deafening and the whole thing just keeps going and going, there is no escape from this pandemonium. The stupid, banal, bull*/it comedy element meant to take the edge of this noise and give you a break from time to time is just bashed in randomly EVERYWHERE and misses the mark completely. Not even the effects keep this above sea level as you simply are too busy with dealing with your motion sickness and cleaning the blood out of your ears to make out what is actually happening. There was some eye candy but to be totally honest I simply don't remember any of it. I praised the incredible production value of the first one which hasn't changed here, but the whole thing is just so raging with mindless content, it is not enjoyable anymore. The only thing I was longing for throughout the whole movie was to see a transformer just sit down for a damn second and silently sip a f/ckin diet coke.<br/><br/>This is a showcase of everything Bay is so infamous for, I have no idea how a mess like this is able to happen at all at this scope. And note, this is the most expensive movie produced so far. Behold capitalism.<br/><br/>3/10"
"sammie_sambal","5","2","7","18 April 2010"," A step back from the first one
","This movie was like seeing myself at the age of 6 playing in the sandbox with my transformer toys and my little sister who keeps trying to bug in with her Barbie's acting out childish romantic escapades. Nothing wrong with big explosions and robots beating the crap out of each other, I still get a kick out of that, but I'm twenty five now-a-days and I like to see a good story with interesting characters and a good script to boot it all up now too. This movie lacks that. <br/><br/>It's a shame too because the first movie was pretty good. Sure, I didn't like the fact that the original transformation sound was only used once and was absent from that point out in both movies, and also that you can't really see what kind of vehicle a transformer is after he is transformed with the millions of parts shifting in all directions during transformation. But overall it was a good movie in itself. The acting was fine, the build up was exciting and the storyline was good too. <br/><br/>Revenge of the Fallen on the other hand does the the complete opposite. The first part of the movie consist mostly of bad acting between people with an even worse script and the second half of the movie is action packed with metal flying everywhere. Nothing wrong with that last part, like I said before, but it's not really that versatile. In many occasions it was just a little to much. It really seemed it was more important to make the explosions even bigger just like the robots and put in more chaos than put time in a good storyline, better characters and a good script. But hey, it's Michael Bay so you shouldn't be that surprised. It's just that I hoped it would be as good as the first movie, and it was definitely not."
"TeddyStockholm","5","2","7","12 April 2010"," Another Michael Bay Action Movie
","were to start..<br/><br/>after i saw the first Transformers i was really chocked that Michael Bay managed to create an awesome movie like this. Transformers was (according to me) the best Action movie i had ever seen. Bay's other movies are flat and simply full of big explosions and massive action scenes. but Transformers truly made me change my thoughts of Bay.<br/><br/>so i waited for two years for Revenge of the fallen to come out. and when i saw it before everyone else in theaters, i was at first just sad, i was sad because Bay had became drunk of power. the movie was just full of unnecessary Explosions, to many Robots and to much Megan Fox. what happened? the first movie was Awesome, and the prequel is this??? then i was just angry, my friends was just ""wow"" and i was like ""hmm..."". how could Michael Bay do this to Transformers!<br/><br/>sure, there are scenes that is totally epic and music that gives you chills in the neck. but that is what the whole movie is about. the tag line for this movie should be - Much Bigger Esploisons, Much More Robots and much more Megan Fox. <br/><br/>Shia LaBeof's performance was actually pretty good and you can see that he has potential to become a great actor. on the other hand, Megan Fox... sweet for the eyes but horrible for the rest of your senses... <br/><br/>the writing was awful! crappy jokes and a mother who is embarrassing to watch. the lines and dialogs in the first film was pretty good but then something happened in the prequel.<br/><br/>you can say that some of good things from the the first movie is back but 20 times bigger/more. and that makes this movie like just another action movie. sure the effects and the sound is outstanding but that doesn't cut it. this could have been a great movie if you put some effort in the story line, the characters and the screenplay<br/><br/>so if you enjoy movies thats packed with explosions and hot girls, and that you don't care for any story or what the characters say. than this is the movie for you."
"colinrgeorge","3","2","7","6 April 2010"," ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen""
","Ignore the wet tendril snaking its way down your neck, it's only your liquidized brain. ""Transformers 2"" is only half way over; you won't need it anyway.<br/><br/>""Revenge of the Fallen"" is huge, loud, and meaningless. After an entirely overlong and comparatively jokey first act, the endless string of Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot level fight sequences will beat your consciousness within an inch of its tolerance. Your eyes will glaze over, unfocus. Is director Michael Bay an artist, a con artist, or a hypnotist? Is there some deeper creative implication behind the trivialization of human (and I guess robot) worth? It's unclear how many people die in the film, but there is a clear lack of sympathy, or even fetishistic pathos to the destruction. What transpires enters and leaves the frame leaving no impression on its viewer whatsoever.<br/><br/>The film is in turns harmlessly dumb summer action fare, and more troublingly numbing and nonsensical. It's an impenetrable spectacle, a two and a half hour kaleidoscope shifting every permutation of guns, metal, and girls. Bay is a hypnotist, but not akin to, say, Godfrey Reggio, the director of the non-narrative documentary ""Koyaanisqatsi,"" but rather a figure unparalleled in film-making for his ability to induce a disconnected vegetative state amidst flying iron fist fights, interplanetary espionage, and rippling firestorms.<br/><br/>The film feels in many ways as though it takes place during one continuous explosion. There are maybe fifteen minutes of hard plot that get stretched, slow-moed, doubled back, and reiterated over the course of the film, and still come out making something less than sense because our protagonists, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) are being hurried from set piece to set piece faster than the speed of logic.<br/><br/>Worst of all, ""Transformers"" is not only desensitizing, but is a dangerous template for future ""family"" action films. The colorful characters and the innocent source material make it seem a safe bet for little Joey, but the film earns its PG-13 rating and then some. There's an unspoken sexual frustration behind the joke writing, explicitly of the most juvenile variety, which I suppose, when examined, fits well with the overall aesthetic, given that the film is little more than a 200 million dollar realization of a thirteen year old's classroom doodles.<br/><br/>There's nothing remotely resembling substance in the picture, and the mind-meltingly repetitive action choreography coupled with the ludicrous running time (its biggest fault) prevent the film from passing even as pure fluff.<br/><br/>But ultimately, these criticisms can be applied generally to the modern blockbuster, and perhaps it's somewhat unfair that ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" happens to be the vehicle to weather the brunt of them. It's just as intellectually flaccid as last month's ""Terminator Salvation,"" but if the box office numbers are any indication, it has much broader commercial appeal. It's an easy punching bag because it exemplifies so many of problems with films of its kind, and after a retrospectively decent first installment, there's no justification for how stupid and stupefying the film is.<br/><br/>So when the credits finally roll and you pinch your temples as you stand up to leave, just be sure not to slip on your brain on the way out."
"Legendary4444","3","2","7","1 April 2010"," Enough Labouf
","Transformers Revenge of the Fallen was an anticipated film. From the trailer, it looked really cool. But oh what a disappointment it was.<br/><br/>The effects were amazing! They were well worth the money.That's the only good thing I have to say. The first hour of the film was entertaining and exciting. (spoiler Alert!) Once Optimus Prime dies the film takes a plunge into an hour of boredom. Watching the horrible acting of Shia Labouf while traveling with two annoying twin robots around the world is just cruel and unusual punishment. Had Sam and the twins been killed in the end, it would have been awesome. This movie really dragged on and on and by the time it was over, I was very happy.The plot was very cheesy and I felt that this film was intended for little boys and was just a big joke. I do not think Michael Bay took this seriously."
"crispyo","2","2","7","9 February 2010"," Boring.
","Even with all the negative reviews, I still thought I'd give this film a go, hoping for a bit of mindless fun, but boy, it wasn't even good enough for that. <br/><br/>What a boring film. It started out OK, CGI was pretty cool, ooh some nice Megan Fox shots, but still waiting for the actual thing that makes a film, you know, plot? The film was getting no where and I was starting to lose interest with the mindless big bangs and shiny red lipstick.<br/><br/>90 minutes in and still all I can see on my screen are huge robots thrashing around the place with Shia LaBeouf and his ""Goddess"" running around like chooks with no heads, and I had even forgotten why.<br/><br/>I couldn't think of a reason why to sit on the couch staring at the TV screen for another 60 minutes... So I didn't.<br/><br/>This is a great example of a movie gone wrong with too much money."
"Mr. D","3","2","7","6 February 2010"," At least I can say I saw it
","Wow, what a difference 2 years can make in a franchise. The original Transformers, while not a great example of filmaking, was at least fun. Dumb and vacant, yes, but fun. Can't say the same thing about this one. I never thought I'd call a Michael Bay action pic boring, but this movie proved me wrong, and I'm not sure why. All the requisite ""Bay-isms"" are there: big explosions, the fetish for military hardware, dizzying whirl-a-cam, second long shots that leave you with no sense of space, mostly naked chicks, loud thundering soundtrack, and generic music score. It should work, hell, it's worked for most of his other movies. For some reason, all of the elements fail this time around. None of the action is even remotely exciting, despite the blaring bass and immersive surround sound. In the middle of the final battle, I was reading texts on my phone instead of watching the carnage, since after 25 minutes of constant booms and bangs I just didn't care anymore.<br/><br/>While Bay's films have rarely had 'great' scripts, also rarely has one failed on this many levels. Showing all the hallmarks of something rushed out the door, the script used to film this movie is horribly disjointed. Contrary to others I was able to figure out the 'plot' fairly well, but that doesn't mean that I liked what was going on. Each transformer comes either personality free or saddled with a juvenile ghetto stereotype (complete with a gold tooth and illiteracy, in some cases). So many outrageous coincidences happen to propel this movie forward, from the 'other primes' to the instant resurrection of Megatron, to the convenient 'death' and instant resurrection of Optimus, to the 'transformer transporter', to the 'robot gods', I could go on and on. Point is even by summer popcorn standards, this script is horrible and makes the ridiculous script from the first movie read like something from the Nolan brothers.<br/><br/>Still, that shouldn't be a deterrence, since Bay has always been about devastation, explosions, and groundbreaking special effects. The explosions, on their own grounds, are pretty, and the destruction is technically adept. Surprisingly, I found the CGI to be a step down from the first movie. While most of the models appear to be the same, the rendering of the robots appears much more 'fake' this time around. Rarely do they take on a physical presence in the shot, and the physics violating animation of the first movie is taken to such a Loony Tunes extreme here that I never bought into what I was seeing. It's been a long time since I've seen CGI sand look as fake as it does when Devastator kicks on his vacuum.<br/><br/>Still, despite all this I didn't hate the movie. I'm actually very ambivalent about it. I'm genuinely puzzled how it made so much money. I'm also more and more convinced that Michael Bay is turning into a modern equivalent of Ed Wood. He clearly loves the process of making films, and seems to genuinely enjoy setting up big explosions and playing with real tanks. He seems to care less and less about the end product as the years go on though, as if everything that doesn't go BANG isn't worth his time. Given how much cash this movie hauled in, I don't see that getting any better.<br/><br/>Oh, I forgot to mention the actors. There are a few of them in the picture, and they run around and scream a lot. Then they get out of the way so another CGI cartoon can bound through the scene, cause a few over-sized explosions, and get shot at by tanks."
"bkeds","2","2","7","31 January 2010"," Oh how far the Fallen has fallen
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a movie that offers so much but delivers so little. It's the definition of a Friday night movie: lots of action and adventure, but a plot that can only be examined on a microscopic level.<br/><br/>There is just so much about this film that's all over the place, it's as if the script is relaxing through half the movie, wakes up for every five minutes and then falls right back asleep. To say the dialogue goes a mile a minute would imply that there's something that actually needs to be heard.<br/><br/>The cinematography isn't bad in some of the more foreign locations, but they do take a backseat to things like CGI. On that note, the visual effects remain just as impressive as its predecessor but because of the large number of characters in the film, they have more usage.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the number of characters turns out to be another flaw for this film. There had to be, AT MINIMUM, 30 different robots with more than half of them having zero relevance to the plot and zip personality. The only significance they seem to provide is a certain craving in the audience to drive the latest sports car. <br/><br/>Shia Labeuf's performance Sam Witwiky has only lightly progressed compared to the first film and has little character development. Megan Fox's character Mikaela seems to suffer a similar fate, with very little to do but be pulled behind Sam like a trailer hitched on to pickup truck. Though they are tolerable compared to such stomach-twisting racial stereotypes as Mudflap & Skids.<br/><br/>If the Fallen wanted to take his revenge out on cinema, he has certainly left its image in ruins."
"rvnc","3","2","7","25 January 2010"," An overbearing nightmare
","My mate described this film as 'Longer and worse' than the first Transformers movie. And that's about right. The first film succeeded perhaps because someone reminded Michael Bay you needed the occasional break from screeching tyres, explosions, thumping music and shouting in order to keep it watchable. Here someone must have forgotten to give him the message. This movie is a relentless white noise that goes on about an hour too long. <br/><br/>The really troubling thing about Transformers 2 compared with Transformers is that everything that was either criticised or ridiculed in the first movie is expanded upon massively in the sequel, while the positives are pushed quietly aside. Didn't like the annoying parents much? They have thirty minutes more screen time. Offended by the black stereotype robot? There are two of them now. Found the fawning to the US military irritating? Well guess what, now Uncle Sam's finest even has jurisdiction over Shanghai. <br/><br/>When you factor in the substantial drop in the quality of the comedy, which has come down from silly but clever radio gags level to the imply stupid 'Look that robot has balls' level, and the fact that Optimus Prime appears to have had a personality transplant, going from a conscientious and a pacifistic leader into a violence loving bad ass it all becomes too much. I haven't even mentioned the plot. Of course its rubbish, you expect it to be rubbish and it doesn't really matter too much, but when everything else is rubbish as well it becomes a real issue.<br/><br/>All in all, its just not very good."
"brandon_lee420","4","2","7","19 January 2010"," Transformers: Revenge of the Utter Crap!
","Michael Bay really wanted to make the second Transformers movie a memorable one and he has succeed, as in more action and less story. The graphics look stylish and extremely cool especially in the fight sequences while the story lacks at everything the first one did right. The acting from Megan Fox, especially, was stupid and idiotic because she thinks that she doesn't have to try so she lets her body do the work and believe me when I say her body fails. I don't put all the blame on her but the script writers as well because it is all clichÃ©d and it has heavily borrowed from fellow action movies. The character development was over the top and that is really sad because it left out some important things. The movie is somewhat predictable at times and the outcome is so predictable that you can become an oracle. Shia Labeouf was pretty okay along with Tyrese and Duhamel but the rest could suck my balls. The movie is melodramatic and it will have you laugh out loud. The humor is okay and some new faces pop up, for instance, The twins, a funny pair of twins who kick butt and laugh, and a fresh new little robot pops up as well and that is Wheelie, a little monster truck with a wacky attitude and a mouth full of swears. The movie can not demolish the first one because the first one was a interesting summer hit while this one is overrated piece of garbage. The film was pretty bad but it did enormously good at the box-office and Michael Bay should make a third transformers. The villains make a good impression in this film as they kick-a*s and get their ass*s kicked back.<br/><br/>Sam WitWicky is living a perfectly normal life along with his girlfriend and his favorite car, BumbleBee. All that goes to waste as the baddies leader, The Fallen, awakens Megatron and unleashed hell on earth. The story unfolds and gets interesting but due to the lack of good storytelling it fails almost completely. The Fallen is going to use a device called the Sun Harvester, a source of energy for the energon by destroying the sun, and it is up to Sam and his Autobot gang to stop this mayhem once and for all. New friendships will be formed and a lot of old faces will be shown once again as the Autobots unleash the fury.<br/><br/>The voice cast for the robots is well-done and the voices of Wheelie, Optimus Prime, The Twins, and Acree ar the best because they offer seriousness and humor combined. This film will appeal to almost every kid but the adults will be saying ""WTF is this movie"". (Spoiler!!)The story is stupid and lame because it uses pyramid as the location of the Sun Harvester and it just is effed up. The film is over-long and a lot of scenes were unnecessary, so my warning to you is don't get over excited and prepare for some brainless action flick. the film is as boring, maybe more, as G.I. Joe: Rise of the Cobra and they both had a sh*tty story and lots of action. I recommend this to anyone who loves the animated series of Transformers and are car lovers for it sure contains tons of that."

","I watched this last night on DVD for the first time( I realise I am a bit behind other comments) and Iam glad I didn't pay to see it. I have created a profile just to warn people about this film. It is to much of everything. I had no idea who was who or what the hell was going on! The action is relentless and confusing with the jerky camera movements, admittedly, the effects are impressive but i would have liked to have had a story to explain why the fights and explosions were happening. The writing is just terrible, the plot is barely there and full of holes and crude testicle and humping jokes.The acting is awful, if you get beyond the close ups of Megan Fox's body, she is terrible but she is not the only offender, the rest of the cast is awful too. The robots are irritating and quite offensive stereotypes and they kill off the only one that is bearable(Optimus Prime) for a large part of the movie. If those robots were human characters people would be having a fit because they are such offensive stereotypes and I haven't even got started on the way Bay treats women in this film. I didn't watch this with high expectations(it being a Bay film) but somehow it managed to disappoint me.<br/><br/>I like a good summer blockbuster action film, I liked the first Transformers, but this is insulting,too long, brainless garbage with too much going on and no amount of close ups pf Megan Fox was ever going save this film."
"shanebeacham","5","2","7","16 December 2009"," Lots to Love, Lots to Hate, and the Twins SUCK
","I'm a huge fan of the first Transformers film. It had everything a summer blockbuster should: great action, great visuals, just a fun time at the theater. And yes, I can understand why some people hate it, but just as a film itself, I thought it was an amazing picture. So I was pretty excited when they announced that there would be another Transformers film. However, when the reviews started coming out, I felt a little discouraged. Then the film made so much money and I thought ""Maybe this won't be so bad."" Unfortunately, it was great either.<br/><br/>There is a lot to love about Revenge of the Fallen. The action scenes are better, the visual effects are more stunning than they were in the last film (which surprised me, seeing as the visuals in Transformers was some of the best visual effects in history). The scenes between Sam's mom and dad made me laugh like crazy in the theater. Linkin Park's song New Divide is a really great song, though many will disagree. We have two really hot women, Megan Fox as Mikeala and Austrailian hottie Isabel Lucas as Terminator babe! (I gotta get me one of those). The things I loved about the first film were better.<br/><br/>But there was also a lot to hate about Revenge of the Fallen sadly.<br/><br/>Okay, for one thing the film is two and a half hours too long. I literally almost fell asleep in the theater. They should have cut it down and gotten rid of some things we didn't need to see. And even the last battle took a while to wake me up.<br/><br/>As well, there are two characters named Skids and Mudflap, and they are one of the most stereotypical, annoying characters I've ever seen on screen. They both sounded like autobots being voiced by the Wayan Bros. And the character of Weelie, which is basically a Joe Pesci robot, is just as bad. He is loud, obnoxious, and just a pointless character.<br/><br/>I'm fine with humor, and the humor in the first film was great and wasn't done throughout the film. In this film, pretty much every word of dialogue is followed by a punch line and some pretty awful ones at times. Dogs humping each others? WTF? The devastator has testicles? Come on.<br/><br/>Megan Fox is a beautiful thing. She has been crowned Earth's finest woman, and I agree she is. But she also does a terrible job in this movie. I'm not saying she's one of the worst actresses on the planet, and I'm not judging her based on the films she's been in. She was actually fine in the first film (even though I spent more time looking at her than listening to her words). But in this film she's not great at all.<br/><br/>There's this character, Leo, who is Sam's roommate. And he serves no purpose to the story, does nothing but yell and scream.<br/><br/>The first hour of this film is the best part, but the rest of the film gets weaker and weaker and weaker, and unfortunately I can't say I liked it. I didn't hate it, but I can't say I liked it. It's sad, because I loved the first film so much."

","If there was ever an award given to the clunkiest mess of a movie ever made, Michael Bay's ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" would probably be at the top of that list.<br/><br/>Seriously, I have never experienced something so mind numbing in my life, and I've seen some real crap movies in my time. The problem with RotF, besides many unnecessary and often crude jokes that weren't even funny, mostly has to do with the pacing of the story. I guess there was a story in there, but trying to find one amongst the slow motion explosions and clanking metal is like trying to find a piece of hay in a stack of needles.<br/><br/>The pacing was so off it was nauseating trying to keep up with anything. The battles, which I will add were pretty intense, just seemed to happen all at once with little or no build-up, and were further marred by multiple camera changes which added to the nausea factor. Half of the time, I couldn't tell what was going or who was fighting who.<br/><br/>And then there was this love story the writers shoe horned in to try and make us care for the characters, but that only hurt the pacing more. Coupled with the sub-par acting from the cast and even worse dialogue, I couldn't find myself giving two shits about anyone. I was half hoping the Decepticons would have won and end this sorry mess of a movie.<br/><br/>I really won't go into how a couple of stereotype based characters were really annoying and bogged the movie down even more than it already was, and how just about any female character in this thing were really just brought in as eye candy in an attempt to distract us from this train wreck of a movie. Seriously, I like T&A as much as the next guy, but geez, dude. This is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Also, seriously, did we really need not one, but two, instances of dog humping? I could have gone without them completely. They added absolutely nothing to the movie. And neither did the (unfunny) joke about Transformer testicles. Sometimes I really have to wonder about you, Mr. Bay.<br/><br/>Although there are a couple of bright spots to be found within this mess. The visual effects, for one, were really well done. Every time I saw Optimus Prime transform I was like ""Cool!"". Soundwave being in this one was really good, too, although I really wish he was in the first movie (which I actually somewhat kinda enjoyed). But cool visual effects, Optimus Prime transforming, and Soundwave just weren't enough to save this one.<br/><br/>I will say with the utmost of honesty that I tried to enjoy this one. Really, I did. But there was just too much going on that I couldn't get into the movie.<br/><br/>Thumbs down."

","I think it's important to realise that this is an old-fashioned kids TV series being updated with modern CGI techniques to appeal to today's younger generation who demand more than scrappy cartoon footage. Adults getting emotional and negative need to realise that this film isn't really for them. It's a kids film. As such, it needs to be reviewed as one. As a kids film, this is great: it's action-packed, stunning to watch, full of one-liners and bumbling characters that make the (age-appropriate) viewer laugh, and acts as a great promotion for an excellent toy-range.<br/><br/>The reviewers giving this film 1 star should stop looking for plot holes (which almost every film has), stop looking for discontinuities between the 30-year old cartoon and today's storyline (!), and just remember during times of childish dialogue or slap-stick humour that this film (like the original story-line) was aimed at kids.<br/><br/>This film receives 10 stars out of 10 from me in order to help balance out the rankings."

Hot Fuzz got 8.5 ratings, but it is the one of the worst comedy movie.<br/><br/>So it looks like for some movie which deserves good ratings have got bad ratings while someone which deserves bad gets good.<br/><br/>Well i don't know about others, but this is one of the best action movie, you should surely watch this movie."

","So this is my first review ever. I'm actually a very tolerant person when it comes to movies or humor but this movie has sort of reached my tolerance level.<br/><br/>First of all I thought the action scenes were great. I loved the fast pace, in particular the desert scene. And that's about all the good I can say about this piece.<br/><br/>As far as the plot goes, when I watch a movie like that, I don't expect one to be there.<br/><br/>The jokes in the movie were horrible and in my taste much too silly... Really? A robot humping the girl? And did that old Robot grand dad really fart? And what's up with the twins? I'd ask if they were the token blacks if it wasn't for Tyrese being in the movie already. A lil hip hop never hurts? Not to mention the absolute silly scene where boy and girl having a fight about relationship issues with their life in danger. And what exactly was the point of bitchy boy in the movie? I can go on and on and I'm really sad that nowadays it seems that action movies cant do without stupid jokes...<br/><br/>Having said that I gave the movie the 4 stars only because of the action scenes.<br/><br/>Oh and did that big robot on the pyramid really have balls?"

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was a great movie. Those who said that this movie was garbage is very wrong!!! OK, the first one was better but what were you expecting from an action/Sci-Fi movie??? I mean how the Autobots were supposed to kill the Decepticons without any explosions?? and after all this movie isn't all about big robots fighting..listen to the background music, uncover the message of this movie. <br/><br/>And if you don't pay attention to the movie of course you don't understand the plot...actually it's very simple..

Right from the beginning till the end the whole audience in the cinema hall were having pure fun. and at the end of the movie every one clapped. this movie must win an Oscar because it was so awesome.<br/><br/>Acting-10 story-9 special effexts-10 Megan Fox-10<br/><br/>please go and watch this movie i recommend it to everyone."
"raheel-4","Null","2","7","1 September 2009"," Brilliant !!!!!!!!
","This movie was brilliant. i went to watch it the first day it came out and it blew me away. A must watch for any transformer fan. It had nonstop action which is what the film was supposed to have and it had lots of robots tearing each other apart and it just doesn't get better than that. The only down side was that the was at least 20 minutes of the movie which could have been removed and it still would have been a great action film. In my opinion, it was better than the first 1 but see for yourself. The last thing is that don't listen to all the 50 year old critics out there who say that it didn't have a good story or that it had bad acting. Well, this is no titanic but it was never meant to be. Michael Bay only makes films with explosions and huge action sequences and this movie had all of it, thats why I thought it was awesome."
"RaZeR505","3","2","7","26 August 2009"," One of the worst blockbusters ever made
","You would expect Transformers 2 to be huge. This movie was a huge letdown. I grew up watching reruns of the Generation One cartoon and Transformers has been part of my life. I know the movies are a new continuity and I'm not going to rip that apart like most Transformers fans have. Of course this was a typical Michael Bay film, over-hyped along with huge explosions, an unstable camera, and eye candy. You would expect Devastator a gigantic to be terrifying and destroy cities much like in Godzilla and other monster movies but no, he tears apart of a pyramid and gets killed with a rail gun. You also got crude toilet humor, with the Twins who are black gangster stereotypes, Devastator's wrecking balls, and Leo tasing himself. Then you have Transformers who were made just to get killed off with less screen time tha Cyclops in X-Men: The Last Stand. Another problem I can think of is they made the Decepticons too weak and hardly look like a threat at all. They also made Optimus Prime and Bumblebee like savages unlike any other continuity from the past 25 years Transformers. Aren't Decepticons suppose to be savages? Anyways this movie is a rare example to me of one that you think less and less as every day passes by. If they make a third Transformers film (and they will since this movie is sadly one of the highest grossing films of all time) they should reboot the franchise. This is worse than Batman and Robin and look what they did to that franchise, they started over. For the next film use the money on people who can actually write and direct a movie instead of eye candy and special effects."
"H_Spengler","2","2","7","10 August 2009"," Elaborate 2.5 hour GM commercial, teen love story, with some robots thrown in
","I put off seeing this for over a month until all the fuss died down.<br/><br/>What a dragging dog of a movie! Just who was this movie supposed to be aimed for? Testosterone filled jocks? <br/><br/>The Bad: The plot, was really convoluted and awful. Half the time it moved so quickly, and so many new twists were thrown in at breakneck speed that I had no idea what was going on.<br/><br/>The toilet humor & general unnecessary grossness. 2 dogs humping each other repeatedly, really overlong and embarrassing stoned scene involving the mother eating a pot brownie and running around campus like a fool. Every minute she's on screen is excruciating.<br/><br/>Bots performing bodily functions such as puking, farting, and crying were terrible, and absolutely unnecessary.<br/><br/>That small ""Pesci-bot"". Even worse later in movie when Pesci-bot humps Megan Fox's leg.<br/><br/>The 2 ""ghetto-bots"" who were the worst ""comic relief"" and blatant racist characters i've ever seen. Jar Jar, take a seat, you might've met your match. How they got away with them is beyond me. <br/><br/>This movie has an obsession with testicles like you wouldn't believe. Whiny roommate complains at least 2-3 times about his being flattened, squished, fell on, tasered, etc. Not to mention the large ""destructo-bot"" than assembles itself at the end has big balls....literally. The bot has 2 large wrecking balls hanging between it's legs. Who's idea was this?! <br/><br/>Female decepticon ripped right from ""Terminator."" That's right, hot chick who's really a robot....she even walks in menacingly slow style, expressionless and all.<br/><br/>Once again during the drawn out big battles, it's hard to tell who's who, and who's on what side doing what. Bots are left and right, and often times changing so quickly it's difficult to appreciate the complexity of the robot, or all the thought that went into the CGI as everything's so dam fast all the time.<br/><br/>I still see not much reason for Megan Fox other than the eye candy love interest. She doesn't say or do anything interesting, or add much to the story. Revlon and Collagen must be happy for the promotions she's brought to them.<br/><br/>The ""Say I love you first"" sub plot is painful and ridiculous, it's would be like watching a movie with two people on the phone saying ""hang up."" ""no you hang up."", ""no YOU hang up first."" Crossing borders with armed guards is as easy as saying ""We're from NY."" and they're waved right in, no passports, no searches, nothing. Are you kidding? I've been given bigger hassles at Canadian bridges WITH my passport.<br/><br/>Human visits robot heaven...'nuff said.<br/><br/>""Old fart"" robot. Complete with cane, he can barely walk, and mummers his way through long boring stories, but he's a sophisticated jet who flies and warp travels with no problem.....give me a break.<br/><br/>The tag-along roommate was irritating as hell.<br/><br/>How is it with all these major daylight battles, some of which are at prominent famous landmarks is the gov't still managing to keep these robots under wraps? They must be working hand in hand with the guys at MIB.<br/><br/>These are just some of the generalized things that make no sense.<br/><br/>Nitpicky: I thought it was strange that Sam's father remarked about him being ""the first Witwicky to go to college."" They live in suburbia California, in a pretty nice modern home with all the creature comforts, and look to be at least a comfortable income. Just what in the hell does his dad do for a living to afford all that? There's not a whole lot of people I know who didn't go to college who are living that comfortably, and some of the one's who did don't.<br/><br/>Elaborate 2 1/2 hour commercial for GM, and the Army. Not that I have a particular problem with either but most of the robots function little other than to show off GM's new line of cars and the cool things they can do. Likewise the Army guys over the top parachuting antics.<br/><br/>The good: Optimus Prime is awesome. Though the story about the primes is kinda hokey, he's still kicks butt.<br/><br/>Bumble Bee: Always did like him, they still haven't given him the screen time he deserves, but it's pretty cool to see him back in one piece and fighting fearlessly. I do still wish he'd remained as the VW bug. Camaro, although cool, is too noticeable....too flashy.<br/><br/>Some of Shia's humor is OK.<br/><br/>The sound effects can be pretty cool at times.<br/><br/>Sam's dad isn't actually all that bad. He's funny without making you want to jab something into your eye.<br/><br/>John Turturro. period. I like John, i'm still trying to figure out what he was doing in the first one, more or less the sequel. Picking up a little vacation paycheck apparently. I was mildly amused at the butt shot tho, as I was amused by his Sector 7 under-gear in the last movie, I don't know, he's a good actor, i'm just still trying to figure out what he's doing in these movies.<br/><br/>A real dragging headache inducing classic Michael Bay boobs & explosion fest. 2/10"
"xamtaro","5","2","7","7 August 2009"," Fallen on its face
","Where should I start?<br/><br/>Maybe i shall start on the plot which, although not a total mess, lacked whatever semblance of depth the first film had. Instead of building upon previously established plot threads, Transformers 2 decides to throw everything out and plonk in a whole new mess of plot threads. The whole backstory about thew ""Primes"" coming to earth eons ago seemed like it was just conveniently inserted into the plot as there was no mention of this particular story thread in the previous movie. The motivations for Megatron have also changed, from chasing the allspark to earth in order to seize its power in the first film to coming to earth to find his ""Master"" whom we are introduced to as ""the fallen"", an ancient decepticon that came to earth a long time ago. Already, inconsistencies with the first film and plot holes the size of Saturn's moons abound. <br/><br/>Next we have the characters. Instead of developing the already underdeveloped robot cast from the first movie, Hasbro decides to include even more robots. Some of them are not even named in the movie and just end up becoming cannon fodder at the end of the day. The already decently developed character of Bumblebee gets sidelined after a rather embarrassing bout of crying with the plot thread of Sam and Bumblebee's strained friendship left undeveloped. Optimus Prime himself takes a dive down from being a level headed and compassionate tactical commander to being an impulsive and brash bully with a bad attitude. He ""talks down"" to humans now instead of treating them as equals, he rushes headlong into a battle without as much as a tactical analysis and he needlessly puts his own team in danger more than once with his impulsiveness. The Fallen, the seemingly new and more menacing villain, comes across as having more bark and no bite; being able to ""use the force"" and throw things around with his mind or something but barely holding his own in actual hand to hand combat. <br/><br/>The humans don't fare any better either. Whatever witty humour there was in the first movie got replaced with terrible, and even offensive sexual jokes. Done in moderation, sexual jokes are fine. But Transformers 2 takes the innuendo to new heights of unnecessary offensiveness. I highlight ""unnecessary"" as many of the jokes could have been replaced with better ones or done away with no effect to the story. It is just so counter productive to have so many sexual jokes in a film made for all ages. It offends the kids and the parents. Heck even me as a teenager felt offended by those jokes. The acting takes a turn for the worse. At times it gets so over the top that the characters some across as caricatures of their former selves, especially John Turturro's character, Agent Simmons. On the other hand, the voice acting from the robot characters keeps more true to its cartoon roots than the first film with more time devoted to dialogue interplay between the autobots or decepticons. <br/><br/>The acting of the human characters is only thing that takes a turn for the worse. The CGI is highly inconsistent in this movie. You got great scenes, very nicely rendered and animated, mostly in the first half of the movie. But once the movie moves to Egypt and toward its climax, the level of detail and fluidity in the CGI robots starts to dip. Its lowest point is at the final battle between Prime and The Fallen which looks like an X-box game cutscene with lighting and texturing on the robots that look really out of place among the physical background.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a wild, unrestrained misguided practice in EXCESS. Everything is just so overblown, from the action, to the acting, to the budget. Even the media coverage and publicity was overblown and it resulted in Transformers 2 NOT living up to the hype.<br/><br/>If anything, Transformers 2 feels like a extra long running toy commercial. All that matters is CGI graphics, action, explosions and new robots. Story, characters and what not apparently do not matter anymore. The sadder thing is that so many people LOVE this kind of shallow and excessive shows that it would just encourage movie producers to make more. This is an pretty but offensively silly excuse for a film; Big and brainless."
"hitman_1980","3","2","7","26 July 2009"," Can it get any dumber than this?
","While the first movie was overall fun to watch, this sequel feels rushed and dumb, even cheap at times. The CGI effects are way too obvious and distracting, the humor is simply dumb and even bad-taste with the exception of a few smarter moments. The plot is totally predictable and the new introduced characters were obviously created for kids under the age of not 12 but 10 at best. This is one of the finest example of Hollywood-style cash-cow milking. Michael Bay didn't care about the final product, he just counted on the money to flow in, otherwise I can't explain how someone can come up with such a lame sequel after the initial spectacular and fun movie. There's nothing memorable here. Nothing! The final battle was overlong and pointless, and the Robot-Heaven scene really had at least half of the audience laughing hysterically, which obviously wasn't the director's original intention. Oh, and let's not forget the female robot-seductress, with a human tongue on her tail! Yes, literally! Bottom line: it can't get any more commercial than this. Give it a rent, at best. While I own the first movie on Blu-Ray, I'd never spend my money on this worthless sequel."
"janeathane","4","2","7","22 July 2009"," Revenge of The Fallen Asleep
","Don't believe the hype. What I was hoping would be the movie of the summer ended up being one of the worst I've seen so far this year. Michael Bay is a beast of a director, don't get me wrong, but I have lost some respect for him after seeing TF2 (Please lets spin around Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox ONE MORE TIME!!!). The first Transformers actually showed that Michael Bay can make a damn good movie, it had the perfect combination of live action and CGI. While filming the sequel he must have forgotten that movies are made with a camera, not a computer as the special effects, while stunning, are overcrowded and overdone.<br/><br/>When the movie began I thought it would be much like the first in its style and greatness, but that ended very quickly. After suffering through about an hour of non-stop tasteless jokes, the action really started going, and going, and going. There were so many robots and subplots being thrown around that it was hard to keep track of who was who and what they were doing. I had a better time watching the fallen asleep surrounding me in the theater than I did watching the fallen in the movie.<br/><br/>The worst part about it is that this movie is going to do well, simply because the original was so amazing, and everyone is hoping to see something as good. But the only thing that is as good as it was in the first is Megan Fox... hot damn."
"WinAMPlify","10","2","7","20 July 2009"," It depends on a POV
","I've seen many comments on IMDb that have listed this movie as horrible and a waste of time but it all depends on what a viewer is looking for. I personally looked for 2hours+ of enjoyment and i got it. Maybe others want a deeper storyline with twists in it but a movie cannot serve the demands of all. This movie has three purposes: 1.to keep throwing action scenes at you 2. to generate a storyline that is likely to bring out another sequel and 3. to please the transformers fans that came to see robots fighting.<br/><br/>Lets face it, this movie is unlikely to win an Oscar but in terms of action scenes, it is jam packed full of em. The jokes are kinda cheesy but they're not the kind to make you cringe in your seat. Megan Fox's acting was as dull as ever but whoever said she was hired to act? Everyone knows shes there as the eye candy and that is her purpose in the film. I just don't understand what others expect from such a film...<br/><br/>So anyway, for all those out there who have yet to watch it, if you've watched the first one then this one is pretty much the same. You're going to get a whole load of action with robots fighting and bombs blasting away. You're going to get Megan Fox as great eye candy and nothing more just like the first one. You're also going to find that the time flies by pretty quickly even though some scenes seem to be dragged out needlessly. Therefore, if you have not watched it, make up your own opinion of it. Trusting someone else's point of view here is the same as jumping off a cliff just because someone else thinks its a good idea."

","... but he has proved, yet again, that he can't direct human actors. He can direct big CGI kaboom-boom, 60 foot tall CGI robots lumbering about, and CGI in general. So why is it his human actors seem incapable of delivering believable lines? And their relationships are forced and more fake than the CGI going on around them? What is it with the dumb sex jokes? This is a movie based on toys and a kids cartoon. It's like making a movie about the Smurfs and inserting human actors and live action scenes... and then adding some soft core porn and an avalanche of unfunny sex jokes.<br/><br/>Spoilers... So many scenes in this movie are just eye-rolling, cringe-worthy, 'yeah right - whatever!' moments. Mr Bay has his female humans present themselves as nothing more than brain dead eye candy. Characters die and come back to life. All the standard action movie clichés are used and are ridden to death.<br/><br/>An attempt is made to insert a plot, but it soon spirals out of control. Sam goes to college and his mother gets wasted on dope cake. Then he is subjected to a near robotic rape by a Decepticon/Terminatrix Fembot and his girlfriend just so happens to walk in on him at *exactly that moment*. She gets her leg humped by a little toy truck Decepticon. A robot farts. Another robot talks like a gangster, but with a lisp because its gold tooth is so huge. A joke is made about testicles.

Even worse than the Decepticons. <br/><br/>The first Transformers was a refreshing change from the usual summer movies . It was funny, action packed , well-acted and well-made. This one however surpasses the original and is the biggest blockbuster ever. Shia LaBeouf,as usual is great , Megan Fox is smokin' hot and the other people who impress are John Turturro as Simmons and Ramon Rodriguez as Leo . <br/><br/>In this movie , the Decepticons return to Earth to capture Sam Witwicky as he finds out about the origin of the Transformers and in his mind is the map of the location of a weapon which will destroy the Earth. Joining the mission to protect the humans are the autobots , Optimus Prime, Bumblebee ,Ironhide and many more new autobots.<br/><br/>The best moments in this movie are the action scenes . They are really good and this movie should win the Oscar for Visual Effects. This movie is also very funny and most of the gags are provided be Simmons, Leo and a few transformers. Michael Bay has done a very good job and like most of his movies , this one has been received negatively by critics. <br/><br/>To the people who have not seen this movie because of the critics, please watch it .Its a lot of fun and I'm sure you'll enjoy it.

","Right. First of all Micheal Bays first transformer film was great for a modern audience. For all you lil'transformer fans (i am one as well) who wanted to hear the 80's soundtrack and unicron were just living in a dream world. The plausibility of that happening was very slim unless you got nelson shin or Gerald Thomas to direct it. At the end of the day transformers were toys nothing more. I enjoyed the film the plot was simple like the first one and the action was second to none, for the people who keep saying why did he have Optimus transform from the plan and then back again, should really stop heavily reading into this film like its requiem for a dream or something. It is purely to show off the transformation get over it. when you watch it and take in the plot you don't really feel like its a solid movie on its own, it feels more like a leading up to. Maybe unicron you never no. Bay was the best person to take on these films he has a great eye for action and also the best contacts with the military that any director has had. Think about this film could went very street fighter if Bay didn't step up to the plate. i always say this to people before going into the cinema Check your brain before you enter if your going to see a chick flick, then don't expect it to be the next Casablanca. if your going to see an action packed film with bid robots then it wont be like fight club. this film was fun go see it and then say what an idiot that (viproductions) is.

"tempestnam","5","2","7","9 July 2009"," Just an average blockbuster...
","Yes, these do happen. Tons of them exist. Movies can make 100s of millions and be just average movies (or even technically bad movies) Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, Matrix Revolutions, The Phantom Menace, Indiana Jones: Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.<br/><br/>The only people rating this 8 and above are looking just for cool special effects and action. And that's fine. But the majority have spoken. Most of us want something beyond just that. We want good acting (after all our money is paying actors millions), we want a good story, character development, etc.<br/><br/>None of those things exist in this movie.<br/><br/>Let's look at Michael Bays Body of work here. Tell me what Oscar monsters or Great 10 out of 10 movies are in there.<br/><br/>Bad Boys, Bad Boys II, The Rock, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, The Island.<br/><br/>There's a theme here. And it's not Great movies or Oscar winners. It's ""I will show the American Public Mindless Cool Special Effects, get relatively good actors to believe I'm making something, and get paid to show my child like directing abilities"" I'm sure Will Smith, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, Ben Affleck, Nick Cage, Josh Hartnet, Alec Baldwin, John Voight, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Scarlett Johanson, Ewen McGregor all look at these movies as their best work.<br/><br/>Are some of these movies ""Good"" - Relatively. I mean yes, some are cool, kinda funny, and have some semi-interesting stories.<br/><br/>How with 4 straight directing Bombs, the Transformers folks fell on Michael Bay as their savior is beyond me. Armaggedon 1 out of 5, Pearl Harbor 2 out of 5, Bad Boys II 1 out of 5, The Island 1 1/2 out of 5. But hey...most of his movies make ""some"" money. (Though Bad Boys II and The Island were both considered commercial failures) On the Acting Alone, you have to deduct 2 if not 3 on a 10 point system. There's no character development of the Transformers...and that's vitally necessary as they are the main characters. You don't see Pixar movies not developing their animated characters.<br/><br/>Shaia Lebuff is a ""good"", young, talented actor. But it's mostly potential at this point. Megan Fox we can all agree has the acting range of string cheese. Honestly, how did this girl say ""I don't want a career like Angelina Jolie"" - What you mean a beautiful woman, successful actress, Oscar Winner, Nominated, etc, etc. Complete Acting Range. I mean talk about talented, look over that woman's career. Acting range is ridiculous, she's played pretty much everything.<br/><br/>You mean a career like that Megan? Or one where they tell you to just shut up and look hot? Don't forget Tyrese, you all know he's a giant. My other deduction comes from the story telling, which was just terrible. The plot wasn't bad, it was the execution, which falls on the director, so what did we expect."

I mean, for example, at the end of the first one they dropped Megatron into the ocean so he'd stay frozen...But then in the second one, the Decepticons 'magically' make it to the ocean floor without freezing and 'revive' Megatron. Seriously? WTF.<br/><br/>3. What happened to the sliver that Sam found at the beginning of the movie? It's like the just kinda said F this, and forgot about it.<br/><br/>4. Megan Fox is only in this movie because of her looks. That's it. She can't act, and honestly get's annoying.<br/><br/>5. Lastly, I felt disconnected from the movie from start to finish. That ain't right.<br/><br/>If you like watching sh!t explode, watch it. If you like GOOD movies, skip it."

","The return of Transforms could not have been more abysmal than the ""Revenge of the Fallen"". From the introduction I was bewildered, I had trouble taking this main stream film seriously after this rocky start. After an hour I started to come to terms with the fact that this film has no more to offer me than: Big Explosion, Car Chase, Slow Motion effects and the awkward performance from actor Shia LaBeouf. The second half left me confused, many scenes are fumbled around and edited badly and slightly reminded me of ""Dune"" (what the hell was going on). And why were LaBeouf and Fox always holding hands, WHY! Transformer 2 had some alright parts, its an OK film to just switch off to."

","1 Thing I dunno if anyone said, Where did the Fallen get his Revenge?!?!?!?!<br/><br/>Don't read if u haven't watched yet...So so disappointed with this movie, I believe most of the other commenters said what needs to be said and I agree with most of 'em.. sure the effects were awesome, but for what? other than the lame jokes, almost no continuity with dumb romantic scenes.. The movie makes NO sense.. Think bout it.. In the first movie, megatron kicks Optimus Prime's butt if it wasn't for the allspark dropped into the chest.. in the 2nd movie, Optimus first kicks butt on 3 decepticons, 2 of which is Starscream and Megatron.. Wtf is what? Or when he fought the Fallen, a robot who survived eons on his wisdom and 6 primes couldn't kill him, Optimus comes and just whoops his butt in under 30 seconds? A robot that basically had psionic powers?!?! There was no balance.. I mean The world is searching for Sam because the Decepticons threatened to destroy the world, but u realize on the battlefield at the end of the movie, Megatron is getting hurt by simple bullet, and a microwave would have done more damage than the other decepticons.. Just a couple of ""jets"" and they got pwned.. how the hell were they gonna destroy the world ? 6 autobots, none injured.. over 20 decepticons destroyed.. Yea really bad consistency..

"showgirl626","4","2","7","5 July 2009"," This review has major major major spoilers
","Let me start out by saying that I'm ONLY giving this 4 stars because of Shia and the CGI (but there was way WAY too much CGI). If you don't want the spoilers, skip to the last paragraph...<br/><br/>Good LORD am I disappointed that I wasted my money on this movie. What happened, Michael Bay? Why did you have to abandon your success and go back to your signature style of style without substance? (And not even a particularly good style either.) And Mr. Spielberg, you should be ashamed of yourself.<br/><br/>I must say that I think Shia is following in Will Smith's footsteps; he's going to be unstoppable as he gets a few more years of acting under his belt. As expected, he did a good job, and the special effects were amazing...for about two minutes. Trouble is, they were so over the top - and they went on for such a long time - that it was hard to tell if there was a plot. There wasn't.<br/><br/>The movie went nowhere, and there were too many things that went beyond my ability to suspend my disbelief. I accepted the robots, but there were some serious holes that pulled me right out of the movie. Enough for me to write a novel about it, but I'll just give you a few of the highlights that I haven't blocked out:<br/><br/>The little scrap of the cube that Shia discovered he still had? The robots would have known about it. And the out-of-nowhere introduction of the contraption inside the pyramid? I'm guessing someone would have found it a bit sooner, with little more than a metal detector. The other bits and pieces being protected by the military? The robots were onto it in the first flick, but couldn't even track the kid with a piece of it in the sequel? Stupid, stupid, stupid. The compulsory-but-unnecessary Hot Chick being able to control one of the robots with a simple human-constructed length of chain? Good GOD, it just keeps getting worse and worse.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I think I had involved the electromagnetic pulse that knocked out all troop communications in Egypt. If an EMP knocked everything out, then the defibrillator ""used"" to revive one of the main characters would not have worked. Also, I find it strange that a soldier on the ground knew immediately that they had fallen victim to an EMP, but the general couldn't figure out why he could not communicate with his men. And why didn't the robots just knock out the entire Earth with an EMP? If they had the capability, why were they not intelligent enough to use it? Oh...right...it would have made SENSE.<br/><br/>It just didn't fit that the robots knew some things and not others. Details that seemed critical (and integral to either the characters or settings) were left out of some scenes, and these omissions were a large part of the movie's overall failing.<br/><br/>I also find it unpalatable when a movie calls for the destruction of major well-known cities and landmarks. Good luck integrating these major global changes into the next script.<br/><br/>The movie ground to a halt several times for a character monologue to explain pointless things. Worse yet, too many things were introduced in the sequel that were never referenced in the first - things the robots would have known because of the traits written into the script in the first place.<br/><br/>There were so many things in the movie that were completely unnecessary to the plot - put in just for a cheap laugh. The pot brownies? - give me a break. The Jar Jar Binks version of this film that started out as the ice cream truck? - sheesh.<br/><br/>The dialogue was trite and predictable. I think every single action movie cliché was used. The script was simply awful, ripped off from the most predictable portions of Star Wars, James Bond and Indiana Jones, among others. And I think the producers of The Matrix should sue for copyright infringement.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie was sophisticated only by way of the computing power necessary to create the CGI. I could go on and on (yes, even more than I already have...trust me). Do NOT waste your time and money. Thanks for reading my review."

","I understand why people post titles like ""Disgusting!"" or ""wretched!"" but when it comes to a Transformers movie, how can you say such a thing? I would like to remind people of the original cartoons, very boring, and terribly campy. The reason people were so interested in the originals was because of the minuscule action and fight sequences that were included in a single episode. I would also like to remind everyone that the storyline of the cartoons focused on the Transformers themselves....not the kid who roots them on. It sounds to me like the people who didn't care for this movie, still saw it as a carry on from the last, and that it should continue to fill you with background story. Personally, I am beyond delighted that the movie takes place some time after the last and that the movie doesn't waste time trying to explain. It simply gives a small description of what has happened, and then bombards your mind with action. I think this is what a transformers movie should be, not some sentimental afternoon special.<br/><br/>People expect a deep storyline in everything they see, when in reality, it's still a TRANSFORMERS movie....and last time I checked, all they did was fight........for YEARS....in different forms, it's why they are awesome."

I hated that after everything that happened in the first film, Sam still had no balls and zero appreciation for bumblebee and (even though she annoyed the crap out of me) his girlfriend..I hated how dumb and overly emotional his parents seemed.. I hated how the movie showed ""college life"" to be one giant orgy.. I hated how there was a (somewhat) cool robot chic that vanished, they might as well not have put her in at all.. I hated that they showed Egyptians as peasants with goats, chickens, and donkeys.. I hated how disrespectful it was to call Mikaela a ""ninja"" when she wore a traditional Arabic veil, there was no point to that.. I hated how there were 2 robots - who were meant to be black stereotypes- that were useless..I hated that Sam went to Robot heaven.. I hated how at the end of the movie, Mikaela looked like she finished shooting a Victoria's Secret catalogue.. I hated the perverted sex jokes.. I hated that there were too many characters that I couldn't care less about and not enough of the ones we do care about - Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, etc...

"ihrtpyrs","2","2","7","3 July 2009"," just bad
","So this movie was really quite awful. To sum it up, it's basically a movie that is about an hour and a half too long, consisting of one loud fight scene with robots after another. The only purpose of the actors in this film is to run, scream, hide, oh and look good doing it (Megan Fox looks the best.) After about an hour of viewing, the plot is full of holes, and your brain becomes numb after the non stop action scenes. The humor (or lack there of) in the film, is mainly inappropriate e.g. the two robots that are obvious black stereotypes that can't read and the mother buying a pot brownies. I found it to be rather annoying. <br/><br/>However, the special effects are in fact superb and the robots do look pretty darn cool, but they aren't enough to save the film. It seems like Michael Bey wanted to see just how much stuff he could blow up with the huge budget he was given. Overall, i was extremely disappointed and found myself saying, "" Thank God that's over,"" when the credits started to roll."
"christinaverhulst","2","2","7","2 July 2009"," Waste of $ at the theater & definitely not for under age 13
","I wanted to love this. After the first Transformers (which I've watched75+ times) I waited in huge anticipation of this movie. I ended up severely heart broken. <br/><br/>I am pretty sure that the camera was stuck in zoom for the first part of filming the movie. Most of the shots were so tight and so close up, it made me want to scream! I felt like I was missing most of what was happening. <br/><br/>But my biggest issue was the grade school locker room jokes and the language. The first Transformers made me want to applaud because they kept it so clean and safe for all 3 of my kids to watch (3 yrs, 7 yrs & 10 yrs). There was a little bit of dirt..but not much. Revenge of the Fallen is chock full of very crude and unnecessary sexual jokes. And then there's the language! I am pretty sure that it averaged a swear word every 20-30 seconds in most parts. <br/><br/>I am by no means a prudish parent. But I do believe in reducing their exposure to unneeded vulgarity. I left this movie feeling like it was written, directed and produced by a boy just discovering his sex organs and his ability to swear for the first time. AKA..an 8th grader. <br/><br/>I was so disappointed and my kids will be even more disappointed when I tell them they won't be allowed to see it. So much potential and such a huge waste. :-("
"Quebec_Dragon","6","2","7","1 July 2009"," More than meets the eye: less than meets the brain
","To make an awkward analogy, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is like a stupid and superficial party-crazy super-model on drugs with a car/military fetish. This is a tough movie to review. It's bound to make a ton of money even though the professional critics pretty much hated it. Who's wrong? the public who pays to see it and liked it or the critics? If I don't like it, am I being snobbish and expecting too much of a summer popcorn blockbuster? I liked the first movie way more than I expected, it was fun, spectacular, exciting and the robots were cool. The second movie left me numb and perplexed. It starts well enough with a thrilling action sequence (where you do have trouble identifying who are the good and bad guys, a recurring problem) followed by a relaxed scene showing the funny returning parents (love the mother) and the upcoming trip to college by Sam (played by Shia Labeouf who does a very good job as usual). At that point, the movie still felt right.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how a rather simple plot became confusing. I also had trouble caring about the fate of the characters. Since I'm not particularly dumb and tend to enjoy more complex films, I'll attribute this to bad storytelling. There's even a big deus ex machina for good measure, sign of the lazy writer. The film is also blatantly commercial and excels into making American military look heroic so if those things bug you, steer clear. On one hand, the visual effects are awesome, on the other hand the writing sucks and the dialog is trite. The actions scenes are spectacular but very busy and too often you have trouble identifying the fighting robots. The robots have virtually no characterization and often go unnamed. The exceptions would be Bumblebee but only at the start, the little twin cars who are not only annoying but hard to understand, an older bearded robot seen later on and a tiny hyperactive radio-controlled monster truck. There's a huge variety of Transformers, they look amazing and their transformations are even better than the first film but how I wish they had at least some of the minimal characterizations of the TV shows. Is that too much to ask? <br/><br/>The music is appropriately bombastic or heroic. The sound effects are loud and powerful. Yet the sound mix is sometimes bad, drowning out the voices. The director Michael Bay is quite good at making visually impressive set pieces and money shots (he loves his slow-motion) yet he falters in other ways. The movie logs in at around 2 hours and a half. It started feeling long mid-way through. The old returning characters are still the best, the new ones, either human or robotic, are lackluster. It's certainly not as good as the first film, which to be fair, had the novelty factor going for it. The human parts are not as clever or engaging. There's more robots but keeping track is confusing and it's almost too much of a good thing. The sequel has more of everything except storyline, human touch and charm. If you liked the first, you'll likely be curious to see the sequel, if you haven't done already, but I wouldn't pay full price for it. If you're a male who loves hot babes, hot rods/robots, cool action and lots of explosions, you're going to love this. I was disappointed but not as much as the critics said I should be.<br/><br/>Rating: 5.5 out of 10"

","Although 'Transformers 2' has some impressive set-pieces and the sheer scale of the specially shot IMAX scenes is pretty amazing (although it takes ages before the first one) I have a real issue with the 'bad' language in the movie. Although it's a '12' in the UK and a 'PG-13' in the US, it's still being marketed as a 'family' film but the swearing is completely inappropriate in a film that is going to be seen by young kids. I have a young son and we enjoy going to the cinema to see 'blockbusters' together: when I took him to see a film based on a children's toy line I didn't expect to hear characters using 'curse words' such as 'bitch', 'asshole', 'pussy', or the choice 'pubicfrohead'(?) (I think that's what was said). I also didn't appreciate the humping dogs, the humping robot, or the scene where the 'mom' eats the hash infused brownie and starts telling everyone how her son only lost his 'cherry' recently(especially when my son immediately asked me 'what did she say he lost recently?' and I had to pretend I hadn't heard!). I think the movie's creators should have paid more attention to creating a film that was suitable for it's potential audience rather than it's potential rating."

","A few no-spoiler examples: At one point they are tracking 5 targets. Thirty seconds later, minus one, plus one, and they are now tracking 6.

You'll know it.<br/><br/>These things are minor. It becomes painfully clear however, though a serious flaw in the plot, that these and several other problems were not mistakes. They simply did not care - we will give them our money to watch this trash because we are bored.<br/><br/>This was primarily a waste of time. If they changed nothing other than removing irrelevant characters and the ridiculously unnecessary 90 minute second step in the plot, we could have had a wonderful 40 minute action sequence.<br/><br/>It just wasn't worth the time it took to watch it."
"Beatty1981","5","2","7","30 June 2009"," It is Amazing!!! But Is This Really Transformers?
","What can I say, its Transformers! Of course it's going to be amazing; my only problem with this movie and the entire live action series is that it is not really Transformers. This is an action adventure film using elements and some names from the Transformers universe. This is not the same as Bryan Singer's X-Men or Tim Burton's Batman. In these two films, although modernized, there is a respectful transfer of the mythology that is brought forth into the live action medium that fans, old and new can appreciate. What we have in Revenge of the Fallen and its 2007 predecessor is something altogether different. What if Michal Bay directed Batman and in doing so he made a deal with a clothing company to use only their designs and clothing for all wardrobes in the movie, changing the character designs completely? What if he felt ""The Scarecrow"" was too childish so he changed it to Alfred to make it more believable? Finally, imagine he dropped the storyline of how Bruce Wane's parents died and created his own interpretation. This would never be tolerated in any other mythology based film.<br/><br/>I get that in Hollywood you need to change certain things and that's the exciting part, to see what you loved in a new medium. What is important to remember is that you need to keep it identifiable so the audience can relate what their seeing to what they know. This is Transformers, not Gremlins or Short Circuit. As for non fans, your not hurting the film by designing the characters to, in some way identify with their 80's original cartoon (G1) counterparts. Hugh Jackman didn't need to wear yellow spandex for me to identify him as Wolverine. Is it such a shocker that Prime and Bumblebee are the most popular characters in the series? They are the only ones who remotely look anything like what we can identify with as Transformers. In Revenge of the Fallen there are two new characters, Skids and Mudflap. These characters are at times entertaining and might even work as background characters, but to give them more screen time than Soundwave, Megatron, Prime and pretty much everybody else is absurd. Could Michal Bay get away with making a Batman movie and take two characters that have nothing to do with Batman whatsoever use them as comedic relief and give them more screen time then both Batman and The Joker? We don't need a complete G1 Transformers movie that's exclusive to fan boys, but wakeup and remember what movie it is that we are suppose to be watching. I will say that in Revenge of the Fallen the human element is toned down and the Transformers themselves have more screen time then in its predecessor Transformers 2007. Although I praise Bay for doing that, it is however still a human movie with robots in the background. I wouldn't want to go and see a Spiderman movie where Aunt May and Mary-Jane were the main characters because the writers and director new nothing about the mythology and thought nobody would go and see a movie about a man in a spider suit climbing buildings. There is no excuse this time because the money and the fan base is there. Although the robots have major screen time they lack interaction time. People say this movie is too long, if the time was spent with the Transformers interacting with other Transformers it would be to short! I can agree that this is a summer blockbuster and all it need is action, great, but put it in the forefront. Although amazing it has yet to surpass the human element. There is no way a giant robot war should be on par with Josh Duhamel shouting and Shia LaBeouf running.<br/><br/>Another element that is wrong with Revenge of the Fallen is the character ""The Fallen"". This character has no substance and no screen time, invoking nothing for the audience. The only affect that this character has in the film is taking away screen time from Megatron. I am still unsure if he even has any real fight scenes as it's all a blur, no pun intended. If they wanted to go bigger than Megatron then why, why, why, didn't they use Unicron? I don't get it he's cooler, bigger, better, badder and isn't that what this is all about? Another example of this gross ignorance to an amazing mythology is how Bay brought in Frank Welker to reprise his role as Soundwave. Soundwave has a very distinct voice and to no surprise, Bay chose to use his voice of Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget instead of the original Soundwave voice, why? It only upsets fans and as for the non fans, Soundwave's voice is so much more menacing and down right works better, so what was the problem? It's no surprise that movies such as this usually lose their steam around a third sequel. It has nothing to do with running out of ideas, it has to do with changing what works and people losing faith in the possibility that they will actually get to see what they want on the big screen. People are going to see this movie, not for the story or even the effects; it's the name Transformers and all the weight that this carries, that is why people are going to see it. If you can't nurture this then the seats are going to stop filling up no matter how much action you put in it. Don't get me wrong, I would have to be smoking crack to say don't go to see this movie. As a summer blockbuster it's unmatched, amazing and downright life changing in terms of raising the bar in the action / adventure genre, but is it Transformers as it should be? Sadly the answer is no! If Bay is my Schumacher, Batman and Robin, then I hope some day I meat my Nolan, The Dark Knight."

","The special effects for Transformers were over the top. The plot was unoriginal and a bit overshadowed by the constant action.<br/><br/>Megan Fox is portrayed as possibly the most absolute sex object I have ever encountered in a movie. There isn't a single scene she is in where she is not portrayed as a sex object. She doesn't actually act. She just poses. I don't think the effects people were even satisfied with her natural charms. I am pretty sure they enhanced her using the same effects they used to simulate robots and explosions. Her lips are absolutely dripping wet all through the movie—like they added a coat of Vaseline between each shot. In all fairness, the target audience is adolescent males, so I have to cut them some slack."

","I don't know about any of you, but I go to the movies to be entertained. However, sometimes after watching a movie the ""critics"" comments can be more entertaining. I read them as though they were the Simpson's comic book guy - ""Worst. Sequel. Ever. You can rest assured that I was on the internet expressing my outrage moments after I watched it."" <br/><br/>First off, the comments about the ""racist stereotypes"", there wouldn't be such a thing if people didn't actually act that way. From what we've seen in both Transformers movies and in real life humans, a person can chose who they want to be. How they want to act. How they want to talk. How they want to dress or express themselves.<br/><br/>People do it and it's OK. Robots do it and ""they're racist! OMG!"" Lighten up, folks.<br/><br/>Second - weak story and juvenile toilet humor gets old. I agree they could have done away with Wheelie humping Makaela's leg. The story was a bit rushed and felt like Spiderman 3 - trying to cram too much stuff in the time alloted. There wan't much character development.<br/><br/>Third, I'd have to say is Prime is the (Robot) MAN!! I thought it was great to see him take on 3 Decepticons at once, kicking their asses all over the place, sadly to get it handed back to him by Megatron. When I took my boys to see it at the IMAX, I panned the theater and the audience reaction was the best - total silence watching the hero fall.<br/><br/>The part I found offensive wasn't the Autobot twins. The part I was most offended by was the total disrespect shown by the military just dropping Optimus' body from 50 feet in the air like a pile of scrap metal. As a former Marine, I thought we treated our fallen comrades with more respect than that.<br/><br/>If anyone in the computer animation department reads these comments, I take my hat off to you. You guys did a helluva job and deserve mega Kudos on a job well done. To me there's something majestic about Optimus when he transforms into a robot.<br/><br/>To everyone else - watch the movie (preferrably in IMAX) and judge for yourselves. It's the epitome of summer blockbuster formulaic eye candy - booms, bots, battles and babes. Stories and plot holes, sure, but sometimes that's entertainment.<br/><br/>Speaking of plot holes - did anyone ever think that plot holes are created in movies for things like comics and books to fill? I just read on Wikipedia that a prequel comic was made for the first 'Transformers' movie to illustrate certain things like why Optimus referred to Megatron as ""Brother"" and why Bumblebee's vocal processor was damaged. <br/><br/>There's your explanation for movie plot holes from a marketing novice."

More explosions, more action, more Autobots (and Decepticons), bustier babes, louder music. All that and possibly (sigh!) more are in this much-anticipated, most attended new sequel. But in a way, all this can't mask that the movie lacks the same bite of its predecessor. I enjoyed the original TRANSFORMERS for two things: First and most obviously, it absolutely rocked! Second, it gave me the thrill of being wrong. I initially suspected TRANSFORMERS to be a big and obnoxious CGI-fest with everything bad about Michael Bay in a nutshell. Obviously, it wasn't all bad. But unfortunately, I didn't feel that my entire initial impression on this sequel were wrong.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm expecting too much. TRANSFORMERS 2 wasn't exactly made to have a strong story, convincing characters and even the slightest moments of subtlety. It's about explosions, action, special effects that outdo God and, of course, Bay's promise that it would be bigger and better than its successful predecessor. Well, to put it honestly, TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is merely bigger and louder than its predecessor, but it lacks the amount of effective wit of its predecessor. The original is loaded with action, but it also had a lot of laughs a long the way, as well as a likable charm that touched our inner child. This new movie had the action, and it did have humor, but they feel more like Bay's kind of humor. I'm pretty sure he's laughing every time he gives us as scene where dogs are continuously humping each other (and later, a robot humping the Megan Fox' leg!). I, on the other hand, feel like he was pulling my leg. Not contended with that, he also throws in not one, but two jive-talking robots! One street-talking Jazz in the original I can handle, but two transformers (both voiced by Tom Kenny) talking in jive is one time too many. Thankfully, there are more effective jokes halfway around the movie, when John Turturro's (former) Agent Simmons reappears (sharing some noisy but admittedly hilarious banter with Ramon Rodriguez).<br/><br/>Almost all the characters (robot or human) reappear in this one, but sadly they don't come up with the same amount of charm they did in the original. Shia LaBeouf is back as Sam, and he's still in his usual quirky self, but Bay eventually abandons do develop him further once he plummets him to the action-laden story. His love story with Megan Fox (never appearing in the film without wearing really short shorts and shoulder-less shirts) doesn't exactly light up some city blocks, no matter how hot Bay wants it to be. And, a similar complaint in the original, the movie is just one hour too long (and if my information serves me right, even longer than the original!). Long movies are nothing to me, but what to fill in those hours is something to point out. The original TRANSFORMERS is too long, to be sure, but some of the excess hours are spent right. In this sequel, Bay just couldn't resist how neat his fight sequences are, so he merely repeats them, only bigger the second or third time around, again and again, until he wraps it up with the biggest he can pull off. The film could have been easily be trimmed for better effect.<br/><br/>Still, although I had a lot of nitpicking to do, it is what it is. Loaded with special effects and non-stop (whether I like it or not) action, TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN did make a lot in the box-office (which might guarantee another sequel sometime in the future). Suffice to say, if you liked the first, this will be your cup of tea. <br/><br/>Rating: ** out of 5."
"Tak7","10","2","7","24 June 2009"," Transformers 2, A Extremely Fun Ride
","Was lucky enough to see the midnight launch for this one last night and was extremely hyped up about it - have to admit that the very successful first film had me really wondering whether the second could hit it off anywhere close to the first (admittedly, I had my doubts). However, I couldn't have been more wrong.<br/><br/>NEGATIVES FIRST 1 - as many people are pointing out, the movie seemed to be very long! Whether that had to do with the fact that it was a midnight launch more than anything else, who knows. However, the ""Jetfire to Egypt"" bit, and the subsequent climax of the film seemed far to long and drawn out, which ultimately made Fallen's eventual entrance and final battle feel a bit rushed and unnecessary (it failed to live up to the epic feel that the movie was building it up to be). The thickness of the build up to the real plot starting (Optimus' major plot moment, not wanting to serve up spoilers), seemed a little bit irrelevant and unnecessary, including the psycho-college girl/decepticon trying to seduce Sam..<br/><br/>2 - Also, there seemed to be WAY TO MANY robots in this one, if that's even possible. The premise was a good one - that the Decepticons have returned in masses, and that the autobots have never gone away, instead living in harmony and alliance with the humans. However, there were way to many robot characters that just didn't get any introduction/back development at all. The devastator/constructicons unit for example, had absolutely no personality attached to the their character at all. This could be quite acceptable if you consider the sheer volume of individuals whose characters were being developed in this movie (Sam, Makaela, Jetfire, Megatron, Fallen, and surprisingly, Simmons). However, the most disappointing thing is that the autobots in particular that we fell in love with in the first film - Ironhide and Ratchet, to name a few, are hardly involved in this film (I don't think Ratchet has a single line).<br/><br/>POSITIVES! 1 - BATTLES! Incredibly done, once again! The CGI looks absolutely fantastic, and leaves you absolutely gobsmacked. Some of the scenes that involve the destruction of the decepticons at the hands of the autobots, including Bumblebee in Egypt, and Optimus towards the beginning of the film, looks stunning. The large scale battle at the end in the Egyptian dessert, also looked absolutely amazing, but sadly seemed to lack a little bit of the intrigue and drama that the City Streets battle of the first one seemed to offer. Without doubt though, the sound and the battle sequencing, the smashing and clanging of metal, and the explosions of missiles and gunfire, were both visually and acustically superb - the forest scene that leads to Optimus' important plot moment, with Sam running beneath the raging overhead battle, looked incredible!! 2 - THE COMEDY - One of the big strengths of the first film was the comedic value that it had. Whether it was Simmon's and his S7 underwear, Kevin Dunn as Sam's dad, the comedic notes were well placed and served to offer a lighter undertone to the movie. If the comedy in the first one was good, then the comedy in the 2nd one was GREAT. Simmonsn returns and is, if anything, better fitted into this movie and subsequently offers another SUPERB comedic performance - along with another set of S7 BRIEFS (SORRY ABOUT THE SPOILER!!). July White, Sam's mother, as well as Dunn, have some more incredibly lively scenes when Sam goes to college which leaves you gasping for air the laughs or so intense. Yet much of the comedic value comes from the twins - the two autobot ""Jrs."" Mudflap and Skids, who constantly offer a reminder of how important comedy is in an all-action film like this. At times their humor seemed a bit over the top, but their sheer presence and the way they interact with Sam's roommate is a touch of genius. A particular favorite is when Sam and Makaela have their ""relationship"" talk in the middle of the library, while hiding from the decepticon that his furiously hunting them! jetfire is also brilliant 3 - THE ACTING - perhaps the strongest point in the film is the acting. In a film where much of the focus goes to the robotic GCI effects and the huge on-screen battles, little credit seems to go to the actors. Every single scene with Sam and Makaela, was an absolutely absorbing piece of film that melted your heart. Shia and Megan deliver so much better in this film than they ever did in the first, their performances absolutely superb and never feeling out of place with the film itself. Their interactions seem genuine and heartfelt, especially when the issue of ""love"" comes to place - they appear at comfort with each other as actors, and that is transmitted very obviously to the audience. John Turturro as Simmons, and Josh Duhamel as Lennox, also delivers a strong performance, if not as witty and comedic in the first one, but more serious and to the point in the second one.<br/><br/>OVERALL - This is SUCH a fun film. People were applauding and cheering when Bumblebee slammed the leopard-like decepticon into pieces, gasped with hands to head when Optimus' major plot moment was revealed, laughed histerically at ALL THE comedic moments of the film, and when we walked out we thoroughly felt like we'd been on a unique riding experience. There isn't much better film that you will watch this summer, and while other blockbusters seemed to miss the mark a bit in Wolverine, Star Trek, and Terminator, this one delivers faster and more furious than the first one.<br/><br/>8.5 / 10 - a must see, particularly on the big screen."
"letitberight","6","2","7","28 June 2009"," My Take on Transformers 2
","I've noticed there are two different types of reviews. Those who completely hate this film and those who thought it was amazing. Well I don't really agree with either side on this one. While TF2 is certainly not brilliant, Bay knows how to entertain. Me and my friends went to see Transformers 2 and had a great time. We laughed at the cheesy dialogue, thought the special effects were awesome, decided to ignore the mediocre and melodramatic acting, forgot about the story, and had fun(also enjoyed Megan Fox).<br/><br/>It's no 'One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest' or for that matter 'Terminator 2'(made by the true king of action films) but it's not supposed to be. It's supposed to be mindless fun, which doesn't take itself to seriously. All of Bay's films are like this. So enjoy TF2 for what it is. The best way to watch this movie is with a bunch of friends where you can laugh together and enjoy it. The problem with critics is that they get to critical, they forget about fun films. I love intellectual films where I have to think, but sometimes you just need to relax and escape real life.<br/><br/>I give it a 6/10"
"bstone9928","7","2","7","28 June 2009"," this movie was bad ass
","I was totally blown away from this movie. It was longer and better than the first one. I have no idea where these people are coming up with these bad reviews. I never go see movies on opening weekend but I just felt compelled to see this one on Friday night. We waited over an hour in line. It was worth every minute. We absolutely LOVED IT. There was so much more fighting in this movie and finally bumblebee kicks ass! There was so much more US and foreign military interaction involved, it was awesome! I'm probably going to go see it again, which I've never done for any movie. I liked it just as much as the first one, probably a little better. They finally used a little more adult language and some of the humor was more adult oriented which was great! The graphics were unbelievable and they left the door open for a 3rd installment. I CAN'T WAIT! GO SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN"
"thajose","3","2","7","28 June 2009"," Agreed.....Lackluster
","I agree with a lot of posters. This movie, like the first one is very lackluster. The visual effects are amazing, and even the over all plots have promise, but two hours of crappy script, plot holes, and over exposure from Shia and Megan just kill the rest of the movie. And who the hell is the humor in this movie aimed at? Not little kids, and not adults. The humor in these crap flicks are aimed at 12 year olds who like jokes that rappers make with cuss words just randomly thrown in. No way would I take my kid to see this, when every Transformer other than Optimus is screaming out ""bitch"" in every other line. I fell asleep at the end of this movie. I just got to the point, where I didn't care what happened. I think I'll save my money and go see something else when they further destroy this franchise with Tranformers 3."
"thrashingmad","6","2","7","28 June 2009"," Transformers 2: The BIG movie that couldn't?!?!
","Might have spoilers! I usually wait a few weeks to see the big ""Block Buster"" movies because I don't like lines or crowded theaters. For some reason my wife has been bugging me to take her and the kids to see this since it released on Tuesday. After waiting in line for an hour in the 95 degree California sun, we spent another half an hour in the theater before the movie started.<br/><br/>First off, I went to the first movie because I have 2 school age kids that were wanting to see it. I hated the cartoon because of the juvenile humor and irritating voice characterizations. This first movie IMO had none of these things and was a fantastic action movie!(I gave it an 8) Within the first 10 minutes of the new movie I knew I was going to be disappointed. They added a lot of the voice crap from the cartoon I hated. Why does Hollywood have to ruin movies by adding stereo-typed characters to them? If I see another modern movie with a 70ies style jive voice in it I am going to freaking scream! I see this urban element in tons of the new movies, even in ones that are supposed to be in medieval times! WHY! WHY! WHY! This movie was trying to please way too many age groups IMO. There was way too much sophomoric humor in this movie that was being pushed toward a preteen crowd. I never thought I would spend my hard earned money to see dogs have sex, TWICE! I am not a prude be any means and I like seeing good looking women bent over in their panties but not when I am sitting next to my 13 year old daughter! One of these scenes actually had a soft-core porn feel to it! This movie was a very cool special effects ride with some parts that were just plain irritating! For the rating? I would say it borders on an R for the sexual content, language, drug use and adult humor.<br/><br/>Worth seeing if you have money to burn and nothing to do on a Saturday Night but leave the 16 and under kids at home! <br/><br/>Thanx for reading, Robert"
"FordRanger","4","2","7","28 June 2009"," From all the praise I received from friends, I had expectations...
","The story follows an adolescent Sam Witwicky, just entering college where he meets his room mate who is a follower of the the Autobot conspiracy, whilst also escaping attempts on his life from Decepticons. <br/><br/>The opening scene featuring a hunt for a Decepticon is about the most entertaining the movie gets. After that, we are exposed to low level acting,one-liners, plot lines and next to insulting attempts at cheap distraction with the posing Megan Fox on a motor bike/ slow mo of her falling (with a perverted camera angle) during a fight scene and plenty more *note the 'Species 3' similarity when a Decepticon takes the form of an attractive woman and knocks our hero of his feet.<br/><br/>An All-in attempt at a rehabilitation occurs with the final battle, throwing away the context of a storyline and going all out with action in a last ditch attempt to awe the audience but failing simply because of the lack of context. <br/><br/>But for loud noise, big human-like machines fighting and black-comic- bots incarnate featuring a god-like Optimus Prime voice over, it should be a continuous BLAST."

","my ears, and eyes, came under sustained assault, it is an interesting film. Having said that, there are clear pro's and cons of this film.<br/><br/>The Pro's: for any child who grew up watching the 1980's cartoon, having the the original voice actors, for both the Auto-bots, and Decepticons is a huge plus. <br/><br/>Secondly my absolute favorite transformer: Deception Soudwave, is in this film. Reworked as a Satailite I was a very happy customer. Yet, we needed more of fabulous character. It was chilling to see Soundwave, as a satellite.

"captelephant","5","2","7","27 June 2009"," Significant improvement over the first
","Transformers 2 is basically what I was hoping Transformers 1 would be. Giant robots fighting.<br/><br/>Lots and lots and lots of robots. Giant ones. Fighting. Constantly.<br/><br/>If that's what you want, that's what you get, and you'll leave happy.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the movie walks a weird line between quality and crap.<br/><br/>The fights are frequently stunning and exhilarating, especially at an iMax. On the other hand, the confusing robo-thrashing shots remain, and calling the climactic action scene ""overdone"" is a cosmic understatement.<br/><br/>The human characters are much more likable than they were in T1, and the time we spend with them is more entertaining. Shia and Megan can both actually act. Well! I'd even go so far as to call Shia excellent. Sadly, the ill-conceived ghettobots deeply damage the film's credibility with their shameful, unfunny Jar-Jaring.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and focused on driving the action from one fight to the next. To me this is enormously preferable to the endless, pointless politicking of the first film. On the other hand, it's still really silly stuff, and the plot holes are so frequent and enormous that you basically just start ignoring them.<br/><br/>So ultimately, Transformers 2 is a success of comparability. It's better than the first. It's better than your average blockbuster. It's smarter than you might expect but dumber than you might want.<br/><br/>But remember: it's a movie about warring robots! And it does that better than any other movie I can think of."

Wheelie was just as annoying as that other little Tardobot in the animated movie...um...name anyone?.... ^^ ANYWAY. Yes. There was way too much CG. Think about it. Way too much CG? Since when has a movie been able to even deliver such an enormous amount of CG? But people say it's dimming. Well, anyone and everyone is right in that their opinion is the truth to them.<br/><br/>For me (a dim individual), it is everything the animated movie would have been, if the animated movie wasn't just cell drawings. Bay even brought in references to energon as species sustaining. And, since a few have problems with megatron having a master, um, what about Galvatron?....Unicron?.....Compare the first and second movie and obviously, Bay watched the animated movie and PAID ATTENTION before making the second one. Humbling in the least, I didn't know his ego and his body could fit in one room at the same time.<br/><br/>I must admit, I was sorely disappointed with Soundwave (who used to rock) and Devastator (and his ""balls"")...Thank god Bay didn't bring in the Dinobots.<br/><br/>K, before I digress too much, it's Transformers. It's supposed to be just a bunch of robots fighting robots and blowing robots up. WATCH THE FIRST TWO MINUTES OF THE ANIMATED MOVIE AND LOOK FOR AN EXPLANATION. It makes sense how? Of course it doesn't, but it rocks.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way, I got ""too old"" for Beast Wars...but I must say, this movie is ALMOST the way it should be....for me anyway. Anyone that remembers the animated movie, will love this.

Bottom line: I spent most of the movie waiting for it to gain traction, yawned, and then poof it was over. My 11 year old loved it but it left me feeling let down.

Not only does it show lack of intelligence, it was mind numbing annoying. The sexual comments, foul language, and Hemp Baked Brownies where not the only thing that ruined this movie.

","I saw this movie with a friend of mine who has been a huge fan of the Transformers series, and we were both utterly astounded at how poorly Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was thrown together. The plot was predictable at nearly every turn. The subplots made you say ""Please, God, let's just move on."" The fight scenes were utterly spectacular... for the first 10 minutes; after that, CGI robots beating the snot out of each other and the US Army special forces (also usually computer-generated), just got old. It was far too much like the third Pirates of the Caribbean Movie: extended battle scenes which do nothing but say ""look what our animators can do!"", too many people trying to be funny (with astoundingly cheap laughs that I would have expected out of a Jack Black movie, not a Michael Bay film), and a plot so convoluted, that even if you do get it, you really don't give a crap. On the plus side, Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas are their usual hot, astoundingly slutty, parts, and the jokes in the movie, which I found incredibly cheap (getting hit in the testicles, an embarrassing parent under the influence, etc.) seemed to make several people in the audience laugh. The fight scenes were indeed amazing, but they just seemed to drag on after a while. Overall, an utterly mediocre movie. If decent acting, good special effects (a LOT of them), a convoluted plot, sappy and predictable subplots, cheap laughs, and Megan Fox almost showing her breasts 1,000 times is your type of movie, I strongly recommend this second Transformers movie. Personally, however, I believe you would be better off renting the Three Stooges (in terms of humor), a Die Hard movie (for pure action), and a cheap porno (for most of the female actresses in this film)."
"nfxstudios","4","2","7","25 June 2009"," Revenge of the Villain Creep
","When I first started reading details about Revenge of the Fallen sometime midway through the production, I was concerned about reports of there being 40+ robots in this film compared to the 10 or so in the original. This problem, villain creep, seems to be a disease that often strikes franchise movies, and usually not with positive results. Indeed, one of the major things that really killed Spiderman 3 was the number of villains – 3 – and there was scarcely enough story to go around.<br/><br/>Then, when the first reviews started coming in from overseas, quickly skimming through most of them gives pretty much the same consensus: too long, too chaotic, too convoluted, perhaps the worst movie of the year.<br/><br/>Regardless, I was going to see Revenge of the Fallen either way. I was an original Transformers fan in the dark ages of the early 80s, and these days my 8 year old son thinks he's Optimus Prime. The first Transformers movie gave me pretty much what I expected or wanted from a Transformers movie: big robots faithful enough to the spirit of the originals without looking boxy and stiff, a basic dumbed-down action movie plot that didn't involve a lot of mental heavy lifting, some pretty visuals (not the least of which was Megan Fox), some nice (if often incoherent) battles, and an identifiable, charismatic lead in Shia LaBeouf. Even if Megatron and Starscream, the two main Decepticon heavyweights, didn't evoke their Generation 1 counterparts as well as Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, or necessarily even have much to do or say, the movie was fast paced, funny, exciting, and overall enjoyable. I liked it a lot as a lightweight summer action movie, and couldn't have asked for more.<br/><br/>As for Revenge of the Fallen, the action sequences, particularly the robot fights, were pretty much as incomprehensible as warned. I was reminded of the old Tex Avery style cartoons where two cats fight furiously in an all-concealing ball of dust with the occasional arm, leg, or tail poking out in one direction or another. Many of the Autobots and Decepticons are so similar in color and so busy in design with the thousands of interconnecting plates making up their bodies, that it's often difficult to tell who exactly is fighting whom, and who's winning.<br/><br/>However, I didn't feel the movie was as unbearably long as most critics seem to indicate, and the storyline nowhere near as complex or convoluted. Even if there isn't always a lot of logic to it, it's a pretty straightforward bad-guys-want-to-take-over-the-universe-and-must-kill-all-good-guys plot. There's probably a store somewhere in Hollywood where they sell stencil templates you can lay on top of computer paper and just spray paint the script. Michael Bay probably even stocked up when there was a good sale going on. For a heavier movie, this would be a death knell, but for an early summer action movie based on a bunch of toys that came out almost 30 years ago, it's a good fit.<br/><br/>This time around, the Decepticons are looking for an alternative source of Energon located somewhere on Earth. The Allspark used to be the source of Energon that powered all the Transformers, until it was destroyed by Sam and Optimus Prime in the first movie. Here, Sam finds a sliver of the Allspark in an old shirt that gives him instant knowledge of advanced physics and mathematics, as well as (eventually), the location of the new Energon source. The Decepticons get their hands on it, and while they're inexplicably unable to learn as much from it as Sam did in about 30 seconds, they do use it to resurrect Megatron.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the US Government is apparently trying to deport the Autobots, while they and Sam race around the globe trying to stop Megatron and the ancient Decepticon known as The Fallen from locating a device that will create Energon by destroying the Sun. Along the way, they meet and power up another ancient Decepticon warrior, Jetfire, who's been masquerading as an SR-71 Blackbird in the Smithsonian (how he didn't come to life when Ben Stiller was running through there earlier this summer is unknown). How he can be so ancient he has only prehistoric knowledge of the Earth and its people, yet is disguised as an airplane no more than 40 or 50 years old, is beyond me. But Jetfire's characterization as a cranky old war veteran who switches sides and helps the good guys was fun, and he's one of the few standout bots among the newcomers.<br/><br/>Ultimately, leaps of logic abound, as do a lot of action clichés such as the heroes running toward the camera as a gigantic explosion erupts behind them. Battles are indeed chaotic and often incomprehensible. And characters seem to show up in places you wouldn't really expect them to be, and where their presence serves no real purpose in the plot. Overall, though, there are enough laughs and thrilling set pieces to offset much of the headshaking nonsense. And while he uses spray-on stencil templates to write his scripts, I've always felt Michael Bay should be applauded for his craft in combining practical and CG effects to do what other directors would simply do in a computer. Bay may not be an artist, but he's at least an accomplished craftsman who knows how to put an action movie together in ways technically different from other similar directors.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Revenge of the Fallen is probably not as bad as most of the critics are indicating; neither is it as good as its predecessor. I'm sure there will be a sequel by 2011 or so. Hopefully Bay will be able to combine the positive elements of each of the first two and craft a genuine summer classic."
"krazey1","7","2","7","24 June 2009"," Special-effects heavy summer popcorn flick
","What constitutes a summer popcorn flick? Three things: sex, explosions (and special effects), and comedy. Transformers 2 contains all three in abundance. <br/><br/>First, the sex. Meghan Fox: a rather good actress who seems to always be typecast as the ""Hot chick"", along with, in this sequel, a second hot chick who vies for the attention of Sam.<br/><br/>Second: explosions. To be expected of a Michael Bay film, explosions and special effects seem to take a main role in the film, not the action and the story. The only recent big budget action film I can recall that didn't rely on special effects was J.J. Abram's Star Trek, in which the special effects complimented the film and story.<br/><br/>Third: comedy. Any good serious story must have comic relief to help the audience take a breather from all the drama unfolding. However, in Transformers, the comedy seems almost out of place at times, detracting from the emotional impact of the main story.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Transformers 2 is worth the ten dollar ticket, and was able to keep my attention for the two and a half hour run time, which passed by just fast enough so that I wasn't looking at my watch wondering when it was going to be over.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"
"w_ooza","4","2","7","24 June 2009"," You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig
","How do you take a very ordinary, very formulaic film idea and turn it into something so over the top that it becomes an over-spectacularised mess of explosions and colour? Well if you're Michael Bay, you:<br/><br/>(a) Shoot every scene with a moving, sweeping camera so that you end up focusing on the bottom of people's chins. Or the bottoms of ""hot girls"". <br/><br/>(b) Base the action around America's world-superiority and military might and exaggerate it to the point that it makes the pro-Americanism sentiments of the likes of Rambo First Blood Part II and Rocky IV seem like dissident communist propaganda.<br/><br/>(c) Get as many helicopters as the film's budget can pay for, which in the case of Transformers 2 is a lot, and have them fly around next to each other for a third of the film's duration.<br/><br/>(d) Have multiple ""funny"" characters of various stereotypically ethnic backgrounds, particularly the African-American 'homie G gangsta', to balance out the hardcore caucasian American patriotism in order to, presumably, deepen the experience of the movie. <br/><br/>(e) Have your CGI artists do the directing for you while blowing up as many things as possible. <br/><br/>And there you have it, the five step formula for a Hollywood blockbuster. However unlike Pearl Harbour, Armageddon, The Rock, and Bad Boys I & II, Transformers started out as an excuse to sell toys to kids with the flimsiest and most nonsensical excuse of a plot holding all the figurines/characters together. Flimsy as in mechanical shape-shifting good guy aliens coming to Earth to fight their mechanical shape-shifting bad guy equivalents, all of them masquerading as vehicles while befriending humans and learning to speak English; nonsensical to the point that if a major character like Optimus Prime dies (in order to pave the way for another series of all-new toys) then no worries, just resurrect him with a convenient plot device like The Matrix of Leadership. In other words, with a film license so full of ""anything goes"", Michael Bay hit the jackpot. <br/><br/>This sequel is practically the same as the first film, the both of them essentially a series of convenient dead character resurrections, an overload of CGI, done up cars, girls with too much makeup, and hit-or- miss jokes (but mainly miss: the two ""wise-cracking"" Homie G transformers are especially cringe-worthy). It's quite clear that the script was written well after the action set-pieces were decided upon - how else could you explain it when characters can travel from America to the Egyptian pyramids in an instant via a teleporting Transformer. Insert teen-relationship staple movie clichés with a Transformer posing as a nubile girl and you've pretty much got your film.<br/><br/>In some ways the movie feels like a revival of the one-man-army popcorn action flick from the 80s and early 90s, and given how Transformers 2 turns out it's rather easy to see why that genre died. For a movie as far-fetched as this with what is practically a prerequisite to turn your brain off as you enter the theatre, it is amazing and even slightly insulting how 9/11 can warrant a mention; Barack Obama is also referred to by name just for realism's sake. I find it extraordinary that such intentionally over-the-top movies, more often than not from Bay himself, can attempt to try their hand at political commentary. Perhaps it was even Obama himself who said it best with the quote, ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig"", which sums up Transformers 2 to a tee."

","OK. So reviews are out and all the hot-shots are calling this film a big expensive disaster. All I hear is how terribly built the plot is, how awful the acting might be, and just how generally disappointing this movie is. Which it definitely is not.<br/><br/>I can't believe anyone would go see a movie like this, a Michael Bay film, expecting a world-class Best Picture nominee. This is Transformers. Get real. I didn't go to this with high hopes for big twists or heart-wrenching well-acted dramatic love scenes, I went to this because I knew it would be a complete jumble of exciting visual effects and outrageous action, which it was. Nonstop action straight from the get-go. Explosions, metal melting and flying everywhere, fight after fight, crunch after crunch--just stuff that can make you laugh and go ""WHOA!"" at the same time. The dialogue was humorous and clever. Clichés may have been abundant, but they're just there to make you chuckle, not have a hysterical laughing breakdown.<br/><br/>I had a complete blast watching this movie. Anyone who has the slightest bit of interest in a larger-than-life over-the-top action film, just for the fun of it, should NOT miss out on this great movie. Definitely one to see in theaters. I'll be back this weekend to watch it again!"
"Drake_Clawfang","6","2","7","24 June 2009"," Tolerable Rehash
","This is not a Transformers sequel - it's the first movie redone with more focus on the robots.<br/><br/>The film's plot is basically the same as the first film - Sam knows the location of the Matrix, and the Decepticons want him to find out where it is so they can conquer earth. The Matrix basically takes the place of the Allspark in that. Sam and Mikayla just run around while the robots fight overhead, track down Agent Simmons who explains what Sam is seeing, leading into a meeting with Jetfire and a plotdump, then a big fight scene.<br/><br/>Now, no sane person is going to expect a Transformers movie to be a masterpiece. All the original cartoon was is this: ""these robots are good, those ones are bad, now watch them beat up on each other"". And this time we get that, the military plays a smaller role and now we focus on the Autobots and Decepticons fighting. The fight scenes are much better, particularly the battle in the forest where Optimus goes 3v1 with Megatron, Starscream and a new guy they never name.<br/><br/>Now, in between the robot fighting, as before, we have the problem we had with the first one - the military. I don't know what Michael Bay's little boy fascination is with tanks and jets, but they don't belong in Transformers. At no one time should there be anymore than six humans on the screen, unless they're fleeing in terror from the giant robots. The military, unless my memory is spotty, never had a major role in the cartoon, and they shouldn't have one here. The only time we should see military hardware on the screen is when they're about to transform.<br/><br/>I really feel bad for Megan Fox in this film, she is quite pretty but they dress Mikayla in low-cut tops and high cut shorts and take any chance they can to shoot her from compromising angles. Alice is even worse with the clear panty-shot in Sam's room. The sex appeal and the humor in this film is overdone, they need to tone it down a bit. There's one scene where it cuts, for no reason at all, to Sam's (male) dogs humping. For ten seconds with no reason at all for it, they cut away to the dogs humping...why!? The sexuality and humor in this film is far too heavy for Transformers. I don't want it totally serious, every film needs *some* comic relief, but this one has too much.<br/><br/>The Transformers now are more than interchangeable robots, but they're still mishandled. Too many clichéd and uninspired personalities, and several Transformers are just not named. Like, there's one Decepticon that's basically a gray clone of Blackout from the first film, and he appears for ten seconds before he get killed. What was the point of that? Alice too, she ultimately served no purpose in the film except for a girl to ogle when Megan Fox wasn't on the screen.<br/><br/>The military is the problem with the fight scenes, I watch Megatron stumbling back from tank fire and am seriously irritated, the only one who knocks Megatron back is Optimus, not some puny humans! The final fight scene is cool, lots of robots fighting, but it's an anti-climax. Jetfire merging with Optimus is the coolest thing in the film, and the new Optimus is awesome, but the fight between Optimus and the Fallen is too short, and Megatron hangs back and watches as his master is beaten and just slips away. Yes, apparently Megatron is the Fallen's ""apprentice"". The Megatron I remember from the cartoons would never take orders, he'd give them, and if Optimus were fighting he would be in there fighting him back, not just watching his minions do it. That's what it ought to be - Optimus vs Megatron, not Optimus vs Fallen or Megatron vs tanks.<br/><br/>Overall, more robots, more dialogue, more fighting, better movie. But it has the same flaws as the first time - too much comic relief, too much focus on the humans, and too much flat Sam-Mikayla romance. All the iconic Michael Bay shots are there - the backlit military vehicles, the swinging and rotating camera around the people, the guy stepping from the car with a low-angle shot, the robot crashing through a building out the other side. Now that I know what to look for I see his stamp on his movie like a neon sign, and I now realize that Michael Bay and his filming conventions are the overall problem with the film. It's still good, but his obsession with hand-cameras and tanks are too much for a second movie. And while the flaws are the same, they've had time to clean up the flaws from the first film and haven't, so those same flaws are even worse for it.<br/><br/>I have no doubt there will be a third movie, and I do hope it's good. Transformers 2 is just as good, maybe a bit better, than the first, but it's still not the movie we fans want or the franchise deserves. The sequel is a strong step closer to the ""true"" Transformers movie, but still isn't there yet. But it's closer than the first one, so give it credit for that. I'd say it's worth seeing if you liked the first movie. But if you hated the first movie, I doubt you'll find this one any more tolerable."
"goldenarm","4","2","7","24 June 2009"," Not good at all
","This movie had a very bad storyline, terrible acting and decent special effects. Did a 13 year old create this movie? First of all, the college experience of Sam is boring and unforgettable. It was almost like two movies in one. One being bad the other being horrible. The transformers movie should be more about the robots like the first one. Also, I am not conservative by any means but there is too much sexual dialogue in the film. I would not take my 10 year old to see this one, yet as a family we loved the first movie. Furthermore, the robots were too silly. It was like watching a futuristic Shrek with a lot of boring bathroom humor. The Transformers use to be about bravado, now they are like watching a bad rerun of family guy. This movie should take some notes from any of the other super hero stories like Batman, X men, or even Iron man."

Anyway I'm not telling Fallen is a bad movie. We can give a ""just pass"" rating for the movie. There wasn't any gripping moment in the movie. It was full of running around or blasting things of throughout the movie. And they should not have done THAT to the Prime, as we know know 50% of the Transfomer's fans are into the Prime. Micheal Bay should have concentrated more on the story rather than the explosions involved. At one moment we are not sure which was an Autobot or a Decepticons. Howewer the robots were really great and the intro was fantastic. In the nutshell ""Robots Rocked Actors Failed""."

It's got more transformers than the previous film but throughout the course of watching it, you'll forget who they are or how they fit into the story. It's also got a fair amount of action but these scenes seem to be completely devoid of any sense of menace / urgency or danger. It also got a ridiculous amount of comic relief, most of which completely misses the target, although the fun element provided by Sam's parents is as welcome as ever. Watch it without keeping your hopes up & you will not be disappointed."

","The twins bothered me little to none; have older twin sisters--Nowif they had been named Sideswipe & Sunstreaker I'd been big time irate. Black & female, I found TF1 more racist of the two; Glen Whitman's 1st 3 scenes were groan inducing, the scene of his & Maggie's taken into custody was horribly blatant. Later Whitman delivered the goods (Unlike Sam's super annoying idiot college roomie). Was hoping Glen Whitman and Maggie Madsen would return in TF2.<br/><br/>Having seen ROTF, wouldn't be surprised learning Rachel Taylor walked away once apprised what script required her to do. As Alice pushed Sam on bed considered walking out but ""I'd miss Prime"". Happily I stayed; classiest character in 2.5 hrs of over top sexploitation profanity and ignorance. Enduring Prime's TF1 ""Sorry, my bad"" or Skids and Mudflap's antics; guess who wins. For love of Prime, only that, I'll rate it a 2--one for each 20 minutes he's on screen. Advised my one married sister (by the way, she married a twin) this wasn't fit for her 10 year old to see and she agreed. I'd even go out on a limb saying Transie girls suffering low esteem in terms of appearance steered even further away. No other way I can interpret it; Bay's forgot female fans a little more than the young boys target market.<br/><br/>Where's respect for women? Hot or dumb boats, no middle ground called smart--including Alice; could've tried knocked Mikaela out when she burst in on her with Sam. Was Alice panty peekaboo necessary? It's obvious Mommy Witwicky doesn't recognize joint plant on package even though she has a young adult son. Not one of those hot co-eds wore loose below waist clothing to the knee or weigh over 130. Mikaela's wardrobe is poster girl for absurd, worst of all her standing white slacks and no bra...in the desert, in an Islamic community...riiiight. Shows how little homework was employed throwing this together and/or no woman on staff pointing out women would more likely wear coveralls working in a garage. Why I didn't I spot only one buff guy entire film and no shirtless guy, buff or stick? (Nauseating) thong butt cheeks failed distracting me from what I really wanted! Why did I leave 1st & 2nd times deciding only hot guy was ten ton Autobot leader? Was doing ear candy double dipping; needed to as I didn't get it from my ultimate Decepticon brand ear candy. Biggest letdown regarding v/a's Bay hires ford Agency girls yet doesn't bother renting a synthesizer for Soundwave! Dunno why but do know Mikaela wants Sam to say he loves her. And she urges him to do it in various ways again and again and again--Wait a sec, didn't by his TF1 actions showed he cared for her? What happened to Mikaela? Before the infamous Wheelie humpty she's flirting with it and it's Sam who pokes it off! How does Mikaela going through 3 sexy suits in space of under ten minutes contribute to Decepticons wreaking havoc, develop The Fallen into a more menacing creature--I'll spoil it for you she's not pivotal in either situation. Script wise she was given more to in TF1; this she's hot fest, ahem, why is she in this? Most annoying change is her clinging to Sam--crying out loud have her take the Matrix to Optimus! Having pointed this out, a slightly deeper question: why couldn't Mikaela already be in college on an engineering scholarship? Why couldn't both of them be members of Nest? Yes besides more screen time for Lennox & Epps--oh wait forgot, less situations permitting Mikaela dressing to sexy excess."
"diab_99","4","3","13","20 June 2009"," It's an action movie.
","It's an action movie; which just about sums up Transformers 2. It plays out like a montage of previous movies in its vain, disposing of the parts which slowed those movies down, you know, boring things like dialog, character development and plot. What we're left with is thrown together array of action sequences where the talky bits in between simply act as segways.<br/><br/>Despite this however, what little character and plot development there is is rather contrived and trite. You are simply waiting for it to be over so you can get back to watching over-sized robots smashing the nine levels of hell out of each other. The attempts at comedy come off as forced and generic, which left me laughing more at how bad the jokes were rather than the jokes themselves. Come on, do we really need the stereotypical comedy-relief duo that speak entirely in Ebonics? All I have to say about LaBeouf is that he's as annoying as ever, the nerdy socially awkward sch-tick is starting to run thin, so unless he starts taking parts in proper movies rather than glorified SFX demo's I'll be avoiding his movies like a case of swine flu. Megan Fox is as pointless as she was in the first movie. Her role consists of standing around and pouting a lot, giving the filmmakers the opportunity to get some, ehm, ""intersting"" shots, but the few attempts she makes at actual acting comes of as laughable. John Turturro returns to spout yet more unfunny dialog, as do the Witwicky parents, but the less said about them, the better. There's also some Mexican kid who cries a lot, and ehm, some other guys who, talk and shoot and stuff...I think.<br/><br/>I have a hard time remembering anything about this movie except for explosions and the sound of grinding metal.

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) <br/><br/>1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Who ever knew that $200-million could make for such an ugly piece of junk? Michael Bay's sequel to his 2007 mega-hit features Shia LaBeouf as Sam Witwicky, who this time is heading off to college leaving his girlfriend (Megan Fox) back at home. While at college Sam begins seeing cryptic symbols and soon the Decepticons are coming after him. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is an incredibly stupid, loud, obnoxious and rather worthless picture that perfectly shows what's so wrong with Hollywood today. Why on Earth would someone green light a picture like this and why on Earth would someone like Steven Spielberg not ask for a re-write of the screenplay? I understand this is a summer blockbuster so the ""story"" isn't the most important thing but what we have here has to be one of the worst written screenplays in the history of cinema and I still can't get over how someone wouldn't at least try to fix some of the various problems going on. Just take a look at how poorly written all of the human characters are. It really seems as if they're in some sort of bad sitcom because we get some of the most obnoxious scenes you're ever going to witness and what makes them so painful to watch is how unfunny they are. Take a look at the scene where Sam is getting dropped off at college and his parents embarrass him but it gets even worse when the mother eats some hash brownies and goes crazy on campus. Give me a break. Did someone in the script stages actually think this was funny? The dialogue going back and forth between the characters are just brain-numbing bad because it really does come off as if they don't know what they're talking about and just making up words and putting them together without any thought. A Bay film usually at least delivers on the action but even these scenes are rather boring here. Once again there are a lot of explosions, loud noises and of course things going boom but all of them are rather ugly and poor looking. I think it's obvious that most of the $200-million budget went towards the CGI effects but I found all of them to be quite poor, which is rather shocking considering how good they looked in the first picture. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN is a really, really bad movie on all levels but how it got to the shooting stages is beyond me."
"Hayfax_Jo","3","12","87","18 June 2009"," Least worst sequel to a Transformers movie I've ever seen
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen - is it a bone fide hit in the making or a load of noisy old rubbish? Well, it's both, quite probably. Having not seen the first film I hoped there would be a sufficient introduction to get me into the Transformers world, but I don't think the filmmakers could really be bothered as it would have got in the way of whatever explosion happened to be going on at the time. Now, don't get me wrong, explosions are lovely and all, but there was so little by the way of character exploration in this that in no way did you care about any of the protagonists; the almost complete lack of plot didn't help much, either. Well, I say there was no plot - there may have been but I can't be certain because my eyes started to bleed and then I fell asleep.<br/><br/>So, what was good about the movie? Well, Shia was likable in the lead role, Megan was always watchable (although I couldn't tell you what her acting was like), there were a few scenes with Sam's parents that were entertaining, much (although not all) of the effects work was effective but that was about it, I think, because come the end, I still wasn't sure exactly which of the robots were goodies or why I should care. Oh well.<br/><br/>As it is, I think they missed a trick with this one; had they cut down on the swearing a bit they'd have made a PG rating rather than 12A/PG13 and so their prime constituent of eight year old boys could have had a field day without having to drag their poor parents along. And, as I sat there with my low expectations I thought, ""this really IS just like a Saturday morning cartoon"" and so on that basis it was just about tolerable, which is especially odd because I was bored stupid by this kind of mindless cartoon as a kid.<br/><br/>All in all, then, I'd say skip this and go watch Star Trek instead. However, if your only demands are to watch large robots fighting for your gratification towards an ill-defined but doubtless noble cause, then this is the movie for you."
"bob the moo","Null","6","36","6 July 2009"," The money is all up there on the screen, but not a lot else
","There is one thing that you can almost always say about the blockbuster films of Michael Bay and his ilk, and that is that the money is very clearly up there on the screen. The money is there in terms of the locations, the expensive sets, the destruction of those expensive sets and of course the many robots who do always feel like they are really ""in"" the scene with the real aspects. In terms of all this the film is impressive and if you go into the film wondering how on earth anyone could spend so much money making a two hour film then you will leave the cinema with your question answered because it is all right there.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is not much else there with it and indeed many of the problems with the film (and unsurprisingly there are many) cannot be addressed by simply having a lot of money in your hand to throw at it. The plot is the most immediate problem, partly because you have to keep the two human characters central to it whether it makes sense to do so or not. As a result we get a reasonable idea that is stretched too thin and loaded with convenience into a narrative that really never does anything other than provide the most basic of frames for stuff blowing up. The problem is that, because it is so contrived and basic, the viewer never really cares about the story but yet still has to sit through many clunky scenes where the characters explain to one another what is going on and why they are now going somewhere else to blow stuff up. Needless to say that the same writers struggling with this are not able to make much of the characters either. This conspires to undermine the one selling point of the film – the action. Without me caring one bit about the proceedings, the action becomes nothing more than special effects. My heartbeat never increased and my palms never got sweaty because there is no tension, danger, thrill or reason to have any emotional investment in the film whatsoever.<br/><br/>The writing produces the most painful problem as well, which is the lame and ill-fitting attempts at comedy. While watching it I thought to myself ""Will Smith"" does this very well"" because the mixing of comedy with the action of big summer blockbusters is something he is called upon to do very often (I know it is not just him involved in making this work). However here the comedy is poor and it sits really badly alongside the action scenes because the humour is not part of the film so much as an aspect that is inserted in specific scenes. I say this because the film is not ""fun"" in the way good blockbusters can be but rather it feels like boxes were ticked without any intention of whether the various elements fitted together or not. The low points are generally associated with two of the Transformers who have clearly been scripted in a meeting that involved the word ""urban"" being used a lot. Mudflap & Skids are essentially urban stereotypes and I suspect that the people who wrote them probably think that Jar-Jar Binks is a great character as well. At best they are annoying and unfunny; at worst they are offensive race-related stereotypes.<br/><br/>The cast (real and unreal) add to the film's problems although I will acknowledge that the cast don't have a lot to work with when you consider some of the lines they have to deliver and things they have to do. Having said that though, it doesn't help that the film is led by two ""stars"" who we are told are the new big things but who still leave me wondering why on earth they get all this buzz around them. LaBeouf doesn't have the charisma to lead this film and he doesn't really work in comedy, action or romance. OK he jumps around a lot but that's about it – his material is awful at times and it does feel like he just ""went with it"". Fox's role is a lot easier. As with the promotion of the film at various premieres (Fox front and centre, posing for the many press), the film pushes her body to the fore – her first scene has her repeating her ""bent over"" pose from the first film, this time over a motorbike. Personally I don't really see it and am not sure why she is famous while countless equally attractive women have yet to get a breakthrough –outside of her body there doesn't appear to be much else that makes her noteworthy. Oh, and if she is going to continue working her body in action movies, someone needs to buy her a decent sports bra or she find her assets ""depreciating"" the more ""running from explosion"" scenes she does. Turturro doesn't escape the rot but at least he is a bit of fun and even though he is so-so he steals every scene he is in – easy considering he shares some with the annoying Rodriguez. Duhamel and Tyrese do the same as last time with little to offer. The voice work is all very gravelly and fine with OK turns from Weaving, Cullen, Todd and others but Wilson and Kenny should be ashamed – blackface is unacceptable even when if one is a black actor ""wearing"" it.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 is noisy and expensive but offers no more than this. A lot of the problems come with the territory but they have the knock-on effect of leaving the viewer apathetic to the action and ultimately I found it dull and unengaging which is probably its single biggest failing.

","Transformers: Revenge of the fallen is 150 minutes of average acting, next to no plot and lots of explosions.<br/><br/>At the time of writing, I left the cinema roughly two hours ago and I cannot tell you what this film is about but I do feel mentally drained due to the long running time and frequent fantasy violence/explosions/Megan Fox.<br/><br/>This is by no means a bad film, it is well executed and good for what it is: pure popcorn entertainment. The action scenes take up at least 3/4 of the film and are very well done but there is very little story and absolutely nothing to think about. If you liked the first transformers film you will not be disappointed. This is basically more of the same but with less story, more robots and much more comedy.<br/><br/>The running time is perhaps a little much but it is not overly long. I would recommend this to people who like this type of film but if you are looking to connect with characters or want something to think about, this is not for you."

","When I saw the first Transformers, I left the theater happy, but with this one I left the theater really angry.<br/><br/>The only thing this movie had going for it were the action scenes. Other than that, it's horrible.<br/><br/>Unlike the first movie, the comedy was really inappropriate and shouldn't be watched by kids. The movie dragged throughout, and the final battle lasts about a third of the film. I'm not kidding. And this time, many of the actors were terrible. If I talked about everything that was bad about this movie I'd need a whole page so I won't mention everything. The sad thing is that you have to watch this for some of the third movie to make sense, and the third movie is good, Do your best to avoid this movie."

","Granted the movie was entertaining from a storyline perspective. It was a bit long and several of the characters were unimportant and extremely annoying which only added to the length of the film. The first Transformers was far superior and CLEAN with the language and yes I realize PG-13 means 13 and up but the first Transformers wasn't nearly as bad language wise. If it weren't for the tweedledum and tweedledee (didn't you learn anything from jar-jar binks) comedy relief ""fails"", I would've turned off the movie but they added a ""kid friendly"" vibe to the movie only to followed by ""punk-ass"" explicatives for my children to repeat. Those characters were completely pointless from an adult perspective as was the over-the-top acting / failed comedy. Seriously Michael - if you wanted an adult film it should've been R-rated and the first movie should have been as well. If you wanted a kid-friendly movie then what is with the language?"
"vincenzio94","Null","2","8","3 June 2010"," Who allowed this movie to made?
","This movie is just plain terrible. There are pointless action scenes, WAY to many perverted jokes, and too much screaming and yelling. Almost everything in this movie was over done. There is not one scene where there isn't someone yelling, or something blowing up, or someone humping something else. Most of the time you can tell the actors are just posing for the camera like Meghan Fox. In every scene shes in, shes either sticking her butt out or pushing her boobs out. <br/><br/>I would say that all of these flaws are because of Michael Bay. He still doesn't get that setting off a thousand bombs in front of a camera isn't entertainment or dogs or robots humping one another. He needs to get a lot more creative with the action because if he doesn't, his transformers franchise is going right down the drain like it already is."

","This movie is obviously not intended for high artistic merit marks. However, the loud and wild approach goes too far, to the point of being dumb and banal.<br/><br/>The action scenes are anything a fan of the Transformer comics could ever ask for. The characters look real, and seem to actually interact with their environment. The CGI animations are interesting to look at, and the robot duels are choreographed with fervor.<br/><br/>However, the violence and destruction are not backed up by any useful plot. Instead, there are monotonous ""human interest"" subplots that fall completely flat. There's a yawner premise about the guy from the first movie going to college, and trying to distance himself ""from his destiny."" The whole bit about inserting the hero's parents, and how they're always making retard comments is dull. The hero himself acting emo like that guy in Close Encounters; what's up with that? Then he makes weird faces and throws a fit in a science class. In fact, there's always somebody making lame comments that I guess are supposed to be amusing. Right in the middle of battle scenes where people are dying. There's a stereotype soldier, making the usual Eddie Murphy babblings, and (so original:) all army officers are depicted as clods. The actress doing the sultry femme-fatale Decepticon spy needs acting lessons, to put it mildly. As for the villain's desire for revenge; poorly contrived. <br/><br/>In short, a mess."

","Everyone seems to hate this movie so much and I can't figure out why. The special effects are amazing, the acting is good and humorous, the story is pretty good. Everyone seems to criticize the story. The story is from the original Transformers series and isn't just something made up. If you actually pay attention to it, you'll find it's a really good plot. The only thing that bugged me just a little was that the ending kind of dragged on. I know Michael Bay wants to win that special effects Oscar that he and the crew were deprived of in 2007, but he really didn't need that much action. The movie definitely could have been a little shorter, but it's not like it ruined the movie. I really liked how they added characters to Sam's ""gang"". Before it was just him and Mikaela, but now they have that Leo guy and the weird speedo guy too. The twin robots were also pretty funny. Another thing that kind of surprised me was how much sexual humor was included. My mouth actually dropped at certain times, but it still made me laugh, so I was good. One character I want to mention is Sam's mom. She really had about half of my laughs, so I want to say thanks to her. She's hilarious!!!<br/><br/>Everyone needs to stop so harshly criticizing this movie and just try to enjoy it. If you're not a pessimist then you won't even half to ""try"" to enjoy it. This movie is amazing and I'm hoping it will win the best special effects Oscar this year even if it isn't the best...I'm interested to see how G.I. Joe's special effects are, but right now I wish the Oscar would go to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen...a.k.a: the best movie of the summer!!!!!!!"

","What can I say... This movie was great. I believe it is good as or better than the first. A lot of people who didn't like it are pretty crazy or this just isn't your kind of movie. You have to be an action person and absolutely love bumblebee. Bumblebee steps up big time by pulling that one robot apart, it was amazing. And its so sweet how he says that nobody in this world means more to him than Sam does. There were a few parts that they could have done different but if they did it wouldn't have been as good. It made me a little emotional in some parts in particular 2 scenes that were really sad. But i loved how it all played in. The one thing i really didn't like was the girl who was a robot. It kind of seemed like i watching terminator at that point. but it did fit with the movie. I think Mega-tron cheap shots and star scream is pretty cool. A lot of one character in particular was shown a lot (Iron hide.) He was amazing. I loved this movie and i suggest that people go see it no matter what people say because not everyone is the same. I love how they started the movie with the wheel robot. I also loved the old one and Wheelie the new little remote control car. He was funny. It was overall the best movie i have seen and i waited 4 1/2 hours to see it. I was kind of afraid to see it thinking they would ruin it but everything kept my jaw open and at the edge of my seat the entire movie.I would spend the money to go see it again any day and i believe it is my favorite movie now. Thanks Mr. Bay, Shia, Megan and All the Autobots for keeping me in awe."

I am sorry but transformers is a an Action movie and that is what it delivered and that to in a way that blew every one away.<br/><br/>The Action sequences were Kick ASS and could give Godzilla a Run for its money.(No offense).The Special Effects were Simply Out of this world(of course they are what do you expect from Steven Spieldberg).The Fights were shown with superb accuracy and detail.<br/><br/>On watching the cartoons the Transition of the charters from the cartoons to movie world was amazing. the way they showed the aspects of the transformers universe.And the story was also very good and the character of optimus and even Sam was shown with Integrity.Personally i think it couldn't have been filmed in any better way and we must respect the way the movie units deemed it fit and stop saying that it might have been filmed better and that it had no character development. It was a breathtaking visual treat for the Eyes and very Scintillating end which made all the audience in the theater give a standing ovation and cheer in the end(In a posh IMAX theater).So i would like to say to Appreciate Superb movie when it is shown."

"sonegreat","3","2","8","24 June 2009"," Transformers: Michal Bay World
","Spoilers warning:<br/><br/>I would give the general plot before the spoiler warning, but at this point I could not make up a plot for this movie if I tried much less try to describe exactly what I saw.<br/><br/>I should try anyway; Sam (Shia L.) is leaving his girlfriend (Megan F.) and his Autobot Bumble Bee back home to go to college and build a normal live for himself. While that is going on Optimus and his fellow Autobots are hunting down the remaining Deceptacons along side human military team called NEST. While that happens Sam finds a shard of the Cube (see previous movie) which infuses him with great knowledge of the astronomical world and ancient robot language symbols, while that is going on Deceptacons steal another peace of shard that they use to resurrect Megatron, but he is just a help for the bigger foe in the film who is the Fallen because 17,000 years ago he came to earth and... you know what I give up. There is something with a government agent and the primes... whatever. The plot really is this: first movie starts in the desert and ends up in a city, this movie starts in a city and ends up in the desert. <br/><br/>OK I have to confess I have not given much thought to Mr. Bay before, he is not a favorite director of mine by any means and I was somewhat entertained by both Bad Boys and Armageddon and even to a certain extent by the first Transformers movie. So it is fair to say I did not feel any kind of hate towards Bay... but that is before I saw Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen.<br/><br/>That is before I was sucked into the Michale Bay world. You know Michael bay world, where females ranging between the ages of 20-30 are ever present and no matter what profession they occupy, they are unequivocally well put and sexy (I did not say beautiful since that is basically subjective and based on personality, no sir these girls are just hot). It is a world where the college is occupied primarily by hot chicks and frat boys with a few nerd thrown in. It is a world where the U.S military is strong and ever vigilant and can kick anyone's but once they put their mind to it (I support the military as much as the next guy but this is overkill).<br/><br/>It is a world full of racial stereotypes, if not in shape of humans then robots. If you cannot have Bernie Mac and Anthony Anderson (although he does do a voice over) to play of a stereotypical (non-threatening) black man this time, why not just have Spongebob do it. So the voice of Spongebob gives you the robot twins that use black slang that could possibly be tracked back to early 1980's. But just to even things out why not let Buchemi do his best Pechi and give you the stereotypical Italian robot. And give the only black actor on screen (Tyrese G.) the most awful one-liners ever.<br/><br/>To travel further into this strange world: We find Marijuana (hash brownies) have the same effect as alcohol. We find robots that all of a sudden can teleport and transform into organic living beings. We find humor in seeing a robotic testicles and a 50+ year old man wearing a thong (with a clear shot of his buttocks). It is also a world where three different shots take place at three different areas in the world (Egypt, France, and United States) at roughly around the same time, and all three areas have clear sunlight. <br/><br/>Aside from all that there is one really good fight scene in the middle, which comes out OK even with Bay's frantic camera movement. The CGI is fantastic in the film although it still hard to tell most of the robots apart. Oh and the performances are generally awful especially one by Ms. Fox. <br/><br/>I am sure many will enjoy the film despite its flaws but if you are looking for anything more than frat-boy humor and stuff being blown up by mix pieces of metal, then for your own sake please do not see this movie."
"jaredmobarak","5","2","8","23 June 2009"," What if we leave and you're wrong?  Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
","My screening of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ended around 10:00pm. What do we see in the lobby as we exit the theatre? That's right, a line already forming for the midnight show, less than two hours away, the premiere timeslot to expose the world to the ancient Decepticon Fallen. Those kids were ready for a good time, hoping that the sequel lived up to the surprisingly effective first installment. If any of them had asked me as I walked by what I thought, I would have told them the truth  it's not that bad. In hindsight, I think I gave the original too high a rating with an 8/10. It did entertain and the computer graphics were impeccable, but too often did it have me shaking my head at the clumsy script and abundance of cheese. It was a crapshoot on what to expect with a sequel from maestro of destruction Michael Bay. All I knew for sure was that he'd bring more robots, more explosions, and more carnage, because, frankly, that's how he rolls.<br/><br/>Let's put this phenomenon in perspective here. Not only are all local theatres playing a midnight show—yes, even the drive-in—but tomorrow's ""first day"" screenings begin at 10:00am. It's a Wednesday people. I understand it's the summer and most kids are off of school, but one can imagine how many people lining up in the morning are playing hooky from work too. This thing will be breaking the bank for sure, despite the early, mostly derisive, reviews. The people that will be pumping money into Hollywood's coffers aren't likely to be reading those critical analyses anyway. No, instead they are probably going to see it again. In all honesty, I don't blame them one bit. If I were a serious critic, looking at this thing in comparison with the great movies of all time, nitpicking every minute detail, I'd probably be hailing it as one of the worst motion pictures ever. But I am not, and I won't. Transformers 2 is a heck of a lot of fun and I can say with a straight face that, if you enjoyed the first, you will have a blast with the second.<br/><br/>The movie brings what you'd expect from Bay—more of everything. There is a ton more action, mostly robot versus robot fighting, that intrigues immensely. I could have gone without the quips and stupid catchphrases as they throw each other, but that is a minor quibble. Even the comedic aspect is increased, and as someone who thought the first was too campy, this actually isn't a bad thing. The humor is shored up and more honed with less headshaking and more laughing. Even little inside jokes thrown in, like a Bad Boys II poster hanging in Sam's dorm room, sparks a chuckle. I was also beginning to think that John Turturro redeemed himself for a dismally weak performance in the first until they had to put him underneath a robot with two hanging metal orbs, to which he spoke over the radio, ""I'm beneath the robot scrotum"". It was a very poor error in judgment, but, of course, the audience ate it up, along with the twins Mudflap and Skids. I don't know what was more offensive, the ghetto-bots' blatant caricature boarding on racist or the fact that every time Tyrese Gibson was on screen he was saying ""that can't be good"".<br/><br/>The true success here, however, is that the story revolves around the Transformers. If the first film was about Earth and humanity's discovery of this alien race, the sequel is about that race and what it is they are doing here. It is a time for them to prove themselves and show that the trust humanity has given is earned. As a result, we get a ton of computer-generated robotics to brilliant effect. The robots came to Earth to harvest its sun for energy, only to discover life, realizing they must find another sun because they will not destroy a civilization. Except that one Prime decided to stay and reap the power, forever being called Fallen, exiled by the other Primes and blocked from his takeover. That means the Harvester is buried, the matrix key guarded, and Fallen is in hiding awaiting a chance to return. Once Sam touches a remnant of the All-Spark, well, the map to destruction is embedded in his head and the search for Earth's survival is on. Yes, the mythology is convoluted, but if you buy into an alien race of robots coming to our world, well the plot will fall into place too.<br/><br/>So, yeah, the faults of the first are shored up pretty well, but the story loses something in the process. For being over two hours, the end comes with the realization that not much had happened, leaving us with an Optimus Prime voice-over, making us wonder if we accidentally just watched the first film again. Who goes to a Michael Bay film for the strong story, though, right? You go for a good time, an escape from the challenges of our world to watch the little guy defeat an impossible foe and save the world. Bay is the master of escapism and Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one more feather in his cap. You know what to expect and it will be delivered, so just sit back, relax, and enjoy a new adventure, much like the previous, but this time full of robotic goodness from front to back."
"zetes","3","3","16","6 July 2009"," Besides the Racially Insensitive Robot Twins, who amused me to no end (but not in the way they were intended to amuse me), there's nothing worth seeing in this movie
","I saw this at an outdoor theater the night before the Fourth of July. I don't generally like outdoor movies. The atmosphere is kind of neat, kind of retro, but with modern sound design, you're really missing out on something by going to them nowadays. I didn't really care about Transformers 2, though. The first one wasn't that bad, but it wasn't that good, either. Its main problem is that the giant CGI robots were horribly designed and hard to tell apart. They don't look so much like the Transformers that came out of the package as I bought them as a kid as the Transformers that came out of the microwave after my little brother cooked them a little. The action sequences were somewhat incomprehensible, especially the ones with multiple Transformers fighting. The sequel is far worse in this respect, and pretty much all other respects, as well. I think all the action sequences are made up of multiple robots fighting, and you can't tell who they are. Not that it matters, since none of them have an ounce of personality. There's two exceptions to this, though, that provide the film's only entertainment, as prurient as it is. The twin Autobots are the two biggest racial stereotypes that I've seen in a movie since the 1980s. My God, one even has a gold tooth. I think their names are Mantan and Sleep 'n' Eat. This offensiveness amused me to no end. ""Damn! He got et!"" Other than that, there's a couple of humping dogs, a small robot that humps Megan Fox's leg, and a Decepticon ""scrotum"" to laugh at. You have to be pretty juvenile even for that, and luckily I am. If you're not, there's nothing else. And this movie runs two and a half hours! How? The plot is overcomplicated, but still pretty simple and easy to follow. Whenever a character needs to get out of some seemingly impossible situation, they're thrown a special power which has never been mentioned previously. The people who wrote the screenplay need to be shot. Bay doesn't deserve much better. I'm not actually a Bay hater, but he has made a handful of really awful movies. This isn't even his worst - that would be Armageddon. But this is pretty close to as bad."
"JamesMitchell451","2","2","9","21 September 2013"," Someone should've warned us
","Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is one of the worst action movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm supposed to give you guys a synopsis of the plot of this movie, but... there isn't one! I could copy and paste a synopsis from IMDb, but let's be honest here this crap doesn't make any goddamn sense! WOW! Michael Bay has managed to make a movie that is something ridiculous, something like 2 hours and forty-minutes where nothing happens! NOTHING! There are dozens if not hundreds of plot holes in this piece of crap movie, but I don't have time to list them all... no wait yes I do. Let's list some of them right now. * Why can't Megan Fox act worth a damn?! *How come Jetfire has the ability to teleport when no one else does? *Why does Michael bay think we give a crap about any of the human characters?! * Where was that place where the fallen was on? Was it an asteroid? *How come the military couldn't contact their troops in Egypt when a diplomat could talk to command... from Egypt! * If the fallen is so powerful why did he have to revive Megatron? Is he just lazy, he could've clearly killed Optimus by himself and to top it off: It's been shown how untrustworthy and power hungry Megatron is, so why would you trust him of all people? You have an entire army at your disposal, even though it is relatively weakened why not just send Devastator, Starscream, and that giant wheel-bot from the beginning that was like as tall as a skyscraper? It would've been just as effective. *How come Jetfire has a beard? *Why did the Decepticons kidnap Sam's annoying ass parents? *And since when could Transformers transform into hot chicks? The characters in this movie are really annoying. Why do we need human characters in a Transformers movie? Why?! They serve no purpose in the context of the plot. Why do we need Megan Fox? I'm going to disprove of all those guys who says ""Well she's hot, so you shouldn't mind"" and ""Real men like Megan Fox"" Anybody who says these things is a idiot that should be put in a rocket and that rocket should be sent to the goddamn moon. I don't need Transformers to show me hot girls! I could go on the internet and download that type of shlock for free, and it'll probably have more of a plot to it than Revenge Of the Fallen. So to those who go to Transformers movies to see Megan Fox and hot girls: Please for all of our sakes: grow up. All that Megan Fox does in this movie is say stupid stuff like ""Oh Sam, I'll never leave you Sam"" (Which apparently she did, loll) or ""We are in this together Sam"" I mean cut me a break, the romance in the first movie was horrible but here it is even WORSE! Plus the woman just cannot act, maybe she should just become a stripper or something (God knows she certainly dresses like one), and plus she is not attractive: She looks like a goddamn plastic doll, apparently she spent a fortune on plastic surgery, breast implants, and truckloads of makeup and she also devoured the souls of little teenage boys while doing so. And to be fair: I have seen children at elementary school plays give better performances: She has no charisma, no personality, NOTHING! And they add in way too many new robots, it gets to the point where I can't tell the difference between them anymore cause they all look the same. All of them are grey color except for Optimus Prime who is red, The Fallen who is blue,Bumblebee who is yellow, and Mudflap and Skids who are green and red. I mean, they introduce like 30 new Decepticons and you learn the names of like 5 of them. If you had trouble following the first movie, well let's just say as someone who was able to follow the first one, I couldn't tell what the hell was going on. I think that this also leads into my next topic which is: Transformers Revenge Of the Fallen contains some of the worst actions scenes I have ever seen. I mean seriously, Uwe Boll would watch Revenge Of the Fallen, to feel better about himself. Every action scene is shot too close, to frantic, and in such weird angels that it is impossible to tell what the hell is going on. I compare it to if in the first Matrix during the lobby shootout scene someone took a tree and covered the screen so that you couldn't tell what the heck was happening. I also hate this films sense of humor, I mean Michael Bay just isn't funny. The jokes are sexist, racist, childish, and so offensive that in fact they are actually kind of embarrassing:It's like South Park if you took out EVERYTHING that made South Park good and funny you would most likely end up with this. Like the scene where Shia's character's annoying mom eats a bunch of brownies that contain drugs and she goes around being all high and crap and making unfunny jokes, I literally face palmed during that scene. If you found anything in this movie funny, shame on you, SHAME ON YOU AND YOUR HORRIBLE TASTE IN HUMOR! Transformers Revenge Of the Fallen is one of the worst movie sequels Ihave ever seen, and I've seen a lot. Michael Bay really dropped theball on this one, hell even Michael Bay and Shia Lebouf think that Revenge Of The Fallen is crap, no one can defend this turd of a film after even the director and the main star call it crap. All copies of this movie should be burned on sight."

They have real directors working in Hollywood, why did the producers of Transformers go with Bay? Was nobody else home that day when the producers called except Bay? Could the hiring of Michael Bay be seen as some sort of crime? I mean, its has to be fraudulent or at least false- advertising to claim that his movies are entertainment. Oh well, its only your life."
"Velociraptor256","4","2","9","14 September 2010"," Very, very flawed, and yet not a total disaster
","What are the problems with Transformers 2? Really, it's difficult to sum them up, because it is flawed in so many different ways. In-between the action scenes that most of us are watching the movie for, we get a lot of stuff that isn't much fun. Sometimes these scenes are dull and meaningless (at one point, the characters have a long, whispered conversation about something-or-other right when a Decepticon is approaching them, ruining the pacing of the scene). And sometimes they are just stupid: apparently Michael Bay believes that those who enjoy watching giant robots smash things up will also enjoy watching a middle-aged woman get high, or dogs humping each other, or listening to dialogue like ""I am directly below the enemy scrotum."" Being someone who did watch this movie in order to see giant robots smash things up, I can testify that this is not necessarily the case.<br/><br/>There are definitely problems with the characters: most of them aren't terrible, but there are some particular ones (the infamous Autobot twins, and Sam's new college room-mate) which are incredibly annoying and serve no useful purpose at all, and yet get more than their fair share of screen-time. And while it's nice to have some new Autobots and Decepticons, most of them get very little to do and are pretty much wasted.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the climactic action scene: it goes on for too long, there are times when you can't tell what's happening, and a lot of screen time that could be spent showing us Transformers is instead spent showing us exactly how the human military are contributing to the whole thing.<br/><br/>And yet, there are some positives about this movie. Most of the action, like the opening scene in Shanghai, and the scene where Optimus Prime takes on three Decepticons at once, is definitely worth watching. The story itself is reasonably interesting if not executed very well; and any scene featuring the Transformers rather than the human characters is good enough to hold your attention.<br/><br/>In this reviewer's opinion at least, Transformers 2 is not the worst movie of 2009 (it would take something really horrific to beat Bride Wars) or even the worst action movie of 2009 (it's more entertaining than Terminator Salvation) - but it certainly can't be called a good movie."

","How painfully bad and yes I know this film made money. This movie is so chock full clichés it might be trying to be a comedy. The special effects are of course outstanding, however the story is weak to say the lest. It is convoluted and full of plot holes. The romance felt forced, as did the college singular dimensional roommates. Is it just me, or is Shia LaBeou more annoying, then usual in this movie? He tries to act like this tough kid but he comes off like a punk. In every movie he is in, he has this short fuse. I just want someone to pop him in the face and knock him down a peg or two. Maybe a few more DUI's should do it. The sexy Megan Fox is and should be set dressing. Her acting can best be described as wooden. While I know in real life she is a sweet girl that is dedicated to her family, she is in no danger of winning any major acting awards. Maybe a razzie, oh wait, she got nominated for 2 already. I guess this movie was made for 12 year olds? Mr. Bay should really be a second unit guy because he is very good at visual details and action but seems to pay no attention to writing. Hopefully this will be the last outing for transformers but as it made money I'm sure we'll have to endure a few more. Maybe the next one will be better, but I doubt it."
"bmh2010","1","2","9","30 October 2009"," It really is racist all the way through
","I had been hesitant about seeing this movie, partly because I heard the plot and script was even weaker than the first, and partly because I heard that a couple of the little robots were portrayed as stereotypically 'black' in a way that could only offend. So I've finally watched the movie 'to see for myself', and not only is the plot and script as abysmal as I heard, the cast is overwhelmingly white (more so than any other movie I've seen in a few years) and there were actually about 5 offensive stereotypes dotted throughout the movie, mostly black and some Mexican. I'm not overly politically correct or anything, but these characters were like some of the awful stereotypes you see in movies of the 30s and 40s. The director obviously is incredibly ignorant, and the studio (and executive producer Steven Spielberg) obviously put their seal of approval on these portrayals. The special effects are world class, but in light of this who cares?"
"chayankhoidream","1","2","9","22 October 2009"," For those who watched the cartoon, years ago...
","This movie was not designed for normal audiences. It's nothing less than movie created for people with Attention Deficit Disorder.<br/><br/>Let me illustrate this point by discussing the scene where Sam is trying to get away from the Decepticons; and 1 second he's in Bumblebee making his getaway, then suddenly he's in the woods having his life threatened my Megatron. Wait a minute...this is the part where Optimus Prime defends Sam's life and dies in the process...so how did Sam get out of Bumblebee? See this is just 1 example out of many situations in the movie where the convoluted story line is pacing, then suddenly with no continuity goes into another scene. It was quite common in the film to be in one scene, and then cut to the next with no connection, no continuity. One minute they're talking, and the next we cut into some military chatter with some explosions.<br/><br/>Look, I don't expect that Michael Bay is going to pull a 'Wachowski' and direct or build a story line with some higher meanings. After all, it's Transformers not the Matrix, or Being John Malkovich.<br/><br/>But I think Bay has slowly but surely gone over the edge with the constant headache camera shakes, the way over-used 360 degree panning, and the sorry over-used Pyramid plot lines.<br/><br/>The Transformer cartoons had some decent story lines for a cartoon. I think Michael's target audience here is prepubescent teens, who are cracked out on too much sugar and caffeine.<br/><br/>Going into this movie I knew the circumstances involved... But I was still inspired to warn others about the impending headache and the regretful use of time from watching this.<br/><br/>It's clear that Mr. Bay is falling out of scope with his movies. I will not be made a fool of again... I will avert all Bay movies in the future. I will say that I've already boycotted Tom Cruises movies, and haven't regretted it yet. And, at least he's good at his craft!"

","This 2009 follow up to the Massive smash, minor critical hit is nothing short of dull, overly plotted, over crowed and most of all dumb. It tries to live up to the minor smarts the first film had, but it fails miserably because of it's over use of CGI and it's bad script and semi-interesting story. It fails to live up to the Transformers name or even the first film at that. All in all this film is a waste of 200 million dollar.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nothing short of a good idea gone bad, Michael Bay tries and fails to bring up the value of the sequel to his adequate adaption of the popular kids show and toy line. But there are three main reasons that it failed. 1.) It's dull, overlong and it doesn't follow any strict set of rules or even a coherent plot for that matter. 2.) It's terrible and bland acting on most part of the cast brings down the high production values of this film. But to no avail they don't succeed very well. 3.) It's just a plain, old good car with bad parts. All in all this film could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf(Who was alright in the first but bad here.) Tries his best with the bad script and terrible direction on the part of Michael Bay. But he fails to bring any convincing emotion or even good jokes to his character. Megan Fox(who is amazing to look at.) is bad, her bland and inside the box performance is hard to watch sometimes you just want to look at her instead of hear her talk. John Turturro( A saving grace in this film.) Brings the good jokes and the good acting to this film and really makes it one reason to see it just for his time on screen. Josh Duhamel( Another ray of hope.) Does well in this and shows his stuff and makes this film easy to sit trough. But all in all the cast(most of them.) Does alright with there assigned parts and makes this a bad film instead of horrible.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is dumb fun, it uses flashy and stylish CGI rock'em sock'em robot fights, an alluring female lead and bad jokes to entertain. But it fails miserable in it's attempt to be good and plausible entertainment. It drags along for way too long and is very boring at times. But on the bright side it is great fun and a good thrill ride to enjoy. But nothing more. All in all it was a shallow attempt at making a franchise that has been around for more than 30 years and turns it into a bad film. All in all Revenge of the Fallen is an A-Bomb."
"gary-blanchard","1","2","9","24 July 2009"," great special effects. Horrific acting
","First of all, I would like to say that I grew up with Transformers, Ninja Turtles and GI Joe and loved those shows and looked forward to a day when they would make a real live version of them. I thought someone could come along and make that transformation from cartoon to the big screen with minimal effort. All they had to do was follow the plot from the past and add the special effects and it would all fall into place. In this movie, however, it is all about special effects and not at all about a story. Humans were a speck in the plot in the original6 TV show and the transformers were main stage. This movie has way too much focus on the humans and not nearly enough dialogue from the transformers other than cheesy jokes and lame one liners. <br/><br/>I watched this movie for the first ten minutes and quit as soon as the first action scene was over. You can't have an action movie with awesome special effects and then kill it with B movie acting. The first movie was a bit weak, but this one really took a nose dive on performance. Are people really that simple that they could sit through a two hour movie and enjoy special effects over and over with a quick buffer for a plot and come away pleased with the $10 they spent and have a smile on their face? Transformers is way better than this movie and I really hope they remake this and do it right. They did it with Batman and I think they need to do it with this movie too."
"Encoder","10","2","9","9 July 2009"," Worse than Transformers (2007), but not so bad after you've seen it a few times.
","The first time I saw Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen in IMAX I thought it was absolutely horrible. Since then I've seen it 4 more times and every time I do I find it better and better. Once you know where and what the dumb moments are they no longer bother you after a while, and you just focus on the cool parts of the movie and enjoy it for what it is. Bay has a certain style and if you don't just go with it, you'll never be able to enjoy his movies. The problem with Transformers: ROTF is that there was just too much of it. But like I said, after a while you get used to it.<br/><br/>I remember when I saw the first one in theaters I absolutely could not believe Bumblebee actually urinated on Agent Simmons, I thought it was just absolutely the stupidest thing I'd ever seen, so out of place, etc. much like the ""directly below the enemy scrotum"" joke in this one. But after I've seen it a few times, I actually start finding it funny, not because it is, but just because it is so ridiculous and unbelievable that joke is there that it's funny. And I actually think that's the effect Bay is after, I doubt he actually thinks those jokes and scenes fit within the story and are genuinely funny but he's going for the OMG WT*? effect, which can actually be entertaining if you think about it...<br/><br/>I know I'll get the Blu-Ray and watch it over and over again, regardless of what my first impression was, just because the movie is just as much entertaining and cool as it is bad. It is definitely worse than the first one, and it could have been much better, but it's nevertheless a cool-looking sci-fi movie and any Bay fan who liked Armageddon, Transformers and The Island should just accept that this one, despite being inferior to the above titles, is nevertheless still in the same category and accept it for what it is. What's done is done, let's hope Bay will learn from the negative reviews and tune down the bad humor and stupid redundant scenes for the next one, so that its cheesiness is actually enjoyable."

That suddenly it's going to be a drama or a romantic movie like The Bridges of Madison County?

If you don't like Transformers or big action movies like Bay usually does, why write a bad review of the movie in the first place. It's like sending a heavy metal freak to an opera. He'll write exactly the same kind of reviews that the people who thought this movie sucked. If you're a Transformer fan you should go and see this movie. Some fans say it's better than the first one and some say it's a bit worse, but no way it's worth only one or two points on the IMDb scale!!<br/><br/>Transformers 2 has a lot of action and more robots that you ever seen before. The plot is that the Decepticons want to start up a machine here on Earth so that they can make more Energon now when the Allspark is gone and make more Decepticons. The only reason why I didn't give this one 10 points it's cause the final battle is a bit long. Then people find all kind of mistakes in the movie and it'll grow with hundreds more when people get the chance of watching the movie on Blu-Ray frame by frame. But who cares? It's meant to be a action movie and there's not a movie with CGI effects that doesn't have any mistakes.<br/><br/>To all of you who thought that this movie sucked and was a piece of crap and who want their money back from the movie theaters, do all of us REAL TRANSFORMERS FANS a favor. A BIG FAVOR!! Don't even think of going to see part three when it comes out 2012-2013!!

"josephrygaard","4","1","3","23 December 2019"," Before Watching: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009)
","""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" (2009) is the second Transformers movie depicting the infamous robot clash. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen follows suit from its prequel by showcasing great effects and scenery, and also by lacking sound logic and interesting characters. However, this movie takes one step down in the latter category as the first half of the movie is filled with downright absurd situations and a lot of sexual innuendos which feels extremely pushed and wholly unrealistic. It is not until the second half of the runtime that Transformers 2 elevates itself to a similar level of that of the first movie.<br/><br/>The characters can also be perceived as being more extreme, in the sense that there is rarely any moment where characters develop but stay with their ""for or against""-conviction. Their interactions are also noticeably louder, which could be fatiguing for some after two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Conclusively, if one liked the first Transformers, the same won't be too bothered. Nevertheless, if another person spends his or her time watching objectively better movies, that person will be, at which point Transformers 2 stops being entertaining whatsoever.<br/><br/>My personal grade: an annoying 4/10.

"bowmanblue","5","1","3","20 April 2019"," Not an improvement
","Having grown up in the eighties, playing with 'Transformers' toys, reading the 'Transformers' comic and watching the weekly 'Transformers' cartoons, it was fair to say that I was delighted when they were brought to the big screen in 2007. However, what I got was an hour and a half of a teen romantic comedy/drama, followed by a couple of brief scenes with robots who were CALLED names that I recognised then a battle which looked like a load of splinted metal crashing against each other.<br/><br/>Surely they wouldn't do the same again? Oh, wait - they did, only much, much worse. This is the second time I've watched 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' and it hasn't got much better with age. It's a long film (2.5 hours) and dare I say 90% of it is dedicated to the humans. I know I harp back to the eighties cartoon which did also include humans. However, they weren't often the stars of the show (and if they were for a SINGLE episode, I tended to skip it). Here, I'd quite happily skip every single scene with only humans in it (and therefore reduce the film's runtime to about half an hour).<br/><br/>The film follows on from the first, i.e. the good robots (Autobots) are now settled on Earth and are working with the humans to pick off any remaining evil robots (Decepticons). To me, that premise never really worked. Decepticons are huge, nearly indestructible machines of death. An entire army of humans wouldn't really stand a chance against even a single Decepticon. And they don't. It's the Autobots that do all the fighting, meaning what's the point of humans even trying to help in the first place?<br/><br/>Anyway, what you get is about two hours of annoying humans and badly-forced attempts at humour. The Transformers are never really used, other in the action scenes which are so badly-shot that it's impossible to tell who's fighting who. You may just about figure out who Optimus Prime and Bumbebee are, but that's only because of their colours. However, every other Autobot and Decepticon looks exactly the same, i.e. a bunch of silver metal thrown together. If you know the characters from other mediums, like the TV show or comic, you'll know all robots have very distinctive looks and personality. In this film, all is thrown away in favour of generic robots who you never really get to know (and example of this is the Autobot 'Sideswipe' who's always been a red car. A RED car. Here's he's silver and on wheels in robot form. Just... why?<br/><br/>The robots themselves are the stars, however they never really get to shine in the way that they should. Peter Cullen returns (fortunately!) as the voice of Optimus Prime, but even he's not in it for as long as the LEADER and most recognisable face of the franchise should be. I won't spoil it as to why he's not in it, as the film-makers have spoiled the film enough.<br/><br/>I know pretty much every 'Transformers' film has made a tonne of money and this one was no exception. Kids probably love it, but I always feel that films/stories/characters that have been around for a long time with established (and now older) fans need to be handled with a little more care. I'm all for bringing the Transformers to a new generation, but surely it wouldn't be that hard to come up with a way of doing so that appeals to fans, old and new.<br/><br/>I suppose I shouldn't be too hard on the film. The youngsters of today clearly lap it all up. I guess I'm no longer the demographic for these 'robots in disguise.' And I haven't even touched on the way the director, Michael Bay, lingers on Megan Fox's body at every given opportunity and the borderline racial stereotypes applied to some of the robots (when they're allowed on screen!)."

"Screen_Blitz","5","1","3","17 June 2017"," Revenge of The Fallen is loud, explosive metal-on-metal action extravaganza with plenty of visual heft, but very little ambition
","With the massive success of the 2007 Transformers entry, it is only expected that Michael Bay would continue the story. Upon facing a collision course with the 2007-2008 Writer's Strike however, Bay and a trio of writers were in a rush with the production process. The evidence of their production difficulties is greatly shown in this final product of this bombastic 150-minute metal-on-metal action extravaganza. While Bay keeps his promise of spectacular visual heft involving heavy battles of giants robots sparring against each other, the script is the bumbling disappointment. The movie is underplotted, scarce of interesting characters, and signals a decline in the spirit of what the original film is wildly entertaining hit. Of course, hoping for a firmly groundbreaking story in a Michael Bay would probably be a lot of ask for consider the director's past endeavors. This does not stray from the shallowness of his bruised continuation of the Transformers saga. Set after the events of the predecessor, Sam Witwicky (played by Shia Labeouf) has graduated high school and is now heading off to college in attempt to live a normal life away from the Autobots and Decepticons. Kissing his girlfriend Mikaela (played by Megan Fox) and his parents (played by Kevin Dunn and Julie White) good-bye, Sam embarks on his college career, only to be haunted by mysterious symbols printed on a piece of the Allspark. Soon on, Sam finds himself pulled back into the war between the Autobots lead by Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and the Decepticons who set out to wreck havoc on the human race. In the process, Mikaela and Sam's geeky roommate Leo (played by Ramon Rodriguez) are along for the ride. <br/><br/>This film cooks with roughly the same ingredients of the first entry, although it appears a plot may be the very last item on agenda. The story intends on picking up not far from the where the previous film left off and continue the epic saga between the Autobots and the Decepticons. There was some fair potential at hand. Unfortunately, the majority of that potential is squandered on a thinly developed plot that not only fails to properly explain a few elements such as why the Decepticons are still after Sam, but occasionally dives into some absurd plot elements. If you need an example, one of which propels from Sam's sexual encounter with a college girl. After all, the film, even more so than the previous entry, takes heavy advantage from some awkward sexual innuendo including some racy dialogue uttered by the robots and a shot showing John Turturro in a G-string that place some moviegoers (particularly parents who bring their kids) at heave. Some of the humor is surprisingly funny, others are just flat-out crude and out of place. On the plus side, Bay boasts a somewhat commendable aptitude in special effects and visually alluring action set pieces showcasing the autobots and the decepticons going head-to-head and ripping each other apart in a loud explosion galore. The climatic battle set near the Pyramids of Egypt where military tanks are blown up, the pyramid is nearly decimated to pieces, and the explosion racks up a number nearly impossible to count; is sets stone in the film's biggest enchantment. If there is even a minor improvement from the predecessor, it may the performances by both Shia Lebeouf and Megan Fox which really isn't saying much, especially as the latter is once again recycled as a one-dimensional character delivering sex appeal for lingering shots of her body. The rest of the characters are sadly fall short of interest as well, particularly Ramon Rodriguez who's whiny personality and goofiness resembles more of an obnoxious caricature than a compelling character. Even when he lands maybe a few attempts at humor, his character can be quite a vexing device.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is a boisterous sci-fi action eye candy for those who are able to dive into the visually stunning action set pieces to distract themselves from the thinly written plot and characters. For everyone, this one may not be a your cup of tea. By no means is this big-budget sequel an abhorrent disaster. After all, there is plenty of visual heft that is destined to keep the youngster occupied. But it is a disappointing entry in this freshly born saga."

","I loved the 1st movie of the series, so every time one of the Transformers movie is on TV, I make time to watch. This installment of the series has, a priori, a good starting point. The special effects are fabulous, both regarding the robotics, and also the real-life city scenes with fights.<br/><br/>What made the first film successful, beyond the X-effects, was its freshness, a decent story line, sense of humour, good-timed action, and the acting was at least OK.<br/><br/>The freshness is gone in this movie, the pace of the film is like a constant unattended spasmodic heart-attack and the acting is pedestrian on all parts. LeBeouff and Duzamel are not making themselves any favor, like cut from cardboard. Megan Fox should take some acting lessons because she is terrible in this movie, her ""acting' reduced to posing in tight pants and be the accessory of the other characters; that is not her fault, the lack of development of the character, but she is not even good at that. She was acceptable in the first film, so I don't know what happened to her in between. At least the actors who play LeBeouff's parents were OK.<br/><br/>My first half an hour was a raw roar in crescendo. I was getting upset. Why? Pedestrian acting, impossible non-believable happenings in the story, poor stunts, poor development of the story, poor dialogues, lack of freshness, bad pace, and too much pretentiousness. A real put off for multi-million movie.<br/><br/>Then, I caught myself laughing, not laughing because the movie makes you laugh, but laughing at the movie, because some things are so bad, that despite the gazillion dollars spent on this film, this movie felt like a B movie, actually a Z movie. There is fun in the Z. I found that if one watches this film as a comedy, it is way more enjoyable than if one watches it as a science-fiction adventure multi-million film. An unintended comedy. So I ended having a good time!"
"ivo-cobra8","6","1","3","7 November 2015"," A terrible sequel of the Transformers franchise but not the worst one!
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2012) is a forgettable, exhausting science fiction action film. Not the worst one in the series it still a good one in some moments. The worst one that would be Age of Extinction because the film it is just too long and boring. This movie was good, but it lacks on a story and it is forgettable for me. Sam Witwicky goes now for college and he wants to focus more now on his life. He accidentally cross a path on an ancient mystery implanted into his mind by the now-destroyed AllSpark, who has to now unravel ancient origins of the Transformers. Megatron wants to caught Sam while ancient mystery he has in his brain so he can resurrected Fallen and is planning the revenge on the world. Now Sam and his friends have to run for his life and try to stop the Decepticons before is too late. In this one Megatron dies, but on the end of the movie he actually get's resurrected and get's back to life and he stops Fallen. I liked the ending that was the perfect in the film. <br/><br/>The film tends to sag in the middle when the action slows down to progress some of the silly plot. Transformers is not a film about plot, it's about the action - just keep it coming and don't try to make a story from it because it's RIDICULOUS; - Megan Fox still looks amazingly hot but cannot act to save her life. She was too hot and she just did not gave a good acting performance. You may as well just put a cardboard cut-out of her next to Shia Labeouf and it'll do the same job for a fraction of the cost; - A scene towards the end of the movie where there is a small ""dream sequence"" of sorts, and the word ""destiny"" is mentioned. I almost vomited. The word 'ridiculous' doesn't quite do it justice; - The girl that Sam meets at college and who she is. I am simply AMAZED that they actually let that whole thing get put into the movie - it just doesn't fit into the Transformers world and leaves stupendous plot holes and questions; - There isn't enough slow-motion in the action sequences for you to take it all in - Transformers trying to be ""funny"" - yuck.<br/><br/>This movie had everything the fans were waiting for. The story fit, and didn't go willy-nilly. My honesty of the four Transformers. The first one is only the best one and worth to watch it. I watch this movie in 2011 before the third one was released and I thought was better than the first one but no it wasn't. The first movie I always enjoy this one I just can't. Transformers was the only movie I watch it several times. I give up with the last three, I only liked was the music theme they really had wonderful music theme. I didn't got it what was with those pyramid things and who of Transformers was who, they all looked the same The movie got me exhausted, I thought Mikaela was hot and sexy in the beginning of the movie on the bike and the story started wonderful but than just all blow it off and was too long. Sam annoyed me in the beginning when he started screaming Bumblebee and ugh. Transformers 2 is terrible lacking movie, confusing and is the worst story telling and I don't got it either what was with the story. The only thing I enjoy in the movie was the music.<br/><br/>I Like Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen because of the music. 2.weeks ago I did got it 2 BD and I love it. I would watch the third one after the first one. The problem with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was Megan Fox she was to damn hot, she shouldn't be but not all that. They put to much romance than action and less story in it. The final battle in the pyramids wasn't that great as the first one was, Dark of the Moon is Better. The music makes the movies."" Anyway Movie - disappointing! Too much unnecessary comedy. The action was very good, but what was with all of the robot spit? <br/><br/>The confusing plot about the film. One of the most popular, thrill-packed, franchises of all time is back with even more action and more Autobots and Decepticons! In the highly anticipated Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.<br/><br/>I am giving this film a 6/10 because there were moments in the film that I did enjoy them, and there were moments I just couldn't enjoy and did not got it. Still Age of Extinction is seriously the worst one, even Revenge of the Fallen isn't that terrible movie than Age of Extinction is. <br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen , is a 2009 American science fiction action film directed by Michael Bay and executive produced by Steven Spielberg.

"Lord_regent","7","1","3","22 July 2009"," Not as bad as some would have you think
","I'm old enough to remember Transformers cartoons in the 80's and original toys. I'm not so die hard about modern variations to old classic characters. But I am disappointed by taking a page from George Lucas and adding a couple annoying characters to distract us the viewer.<br/><br/>While it would have been nice to see a few more named characters squaring off in the final battle rather than making it a giant free for all. During which, when some robot gets slagged you don't know who it is or care. The few fights that do occur are well done. But a few parts are omitted or edited past without explanation. Overall the movie is about 1/2 hour too long. And it falls short for the typical Michael Bay film."
"bram_shellshocker","6","1","3","8 July 2009"," *SPOILERS* Ups and downs of this movie
","In overall this movie was good. I don't really get why it's getting such bad ratings. Maybe because it had to much action? perhaps.<br/><br/>The most positive thing about ROTF was the dialog of the robots. There was much more communication between them, especially at the decepticons. In this movie we were able to see the deceptive side of Starscream and his.. 'relationship' with megatron. I missed that in the 1st. Also the action. It was way more then the 1st. That's good in one way. In the 1st movie i thought they concentrated way to much on the humans. Now they've turned the roles and i believe it worked out OK.<br/><br/>The bad sides. One of the bad sides is that the new autobots didn't really get that much attention, neither did some of the new decepticons like Longhaul, Sideways and some constructicons. Also, i had the feeling i was rushed trough the movie. Some addaptions in scene overflow could've prevented that. Like switch between the shanghai scene and Sam's house. They went like.. BAM to Sam's house instead of fading out and start with a little cameo of his house (if you know what i mean). Things like that could've made that feeling of being rushed trough the movie disappear.<br/><br/>I don't see why so many reviews call the humor 'juvenile'. Well perhaps it is but it ain't bad, i was able to laugh about lots of stuff. Especially the twins, skids and mudflap! And scenes like optimus dying and Sam dying really made me feel 'bitter' although i knew they would come alive because else the movie could not continue :P.<br/><br/>In short: It's a good movie with stunning and mind blowing action, but sadly a little fast phased."
"weekly-movie-review","7","1","3","7 July 2009"," I must admit that Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen.....
","I must admit that Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen was my most anticipated movie of the summer, maybe even the year. I was really impressed with the first one, so it was hard not to have high expectations for Michael Bay's second installment. I heard certain complaints about the plot, but I find it somewhat interesting as it uses different time periods and introduces some new characters. As the title indicates, the story involves the Decepticons gathering up their forces for another epic battle. I don't want to say too much just in case you haven't seen either of the two movies. As would be expected, the first one should be viewed before seeing this one to get the full effect of the story, but the sequel actually stands quite well on its own. There's an equal blend of comedy and action, but the humor was hit-and-miss to me. The first few minutes were downright hilarious thanks to Kevin Dunn and Julie White (the parents), but later on the humor relies on corny, low-brow jokes and visuals which makes me groan more than laugh. I much prefer the slight dramatic touch of the first movie that this one lacks. While I'm nitpicking, I'll point out that the cinematography during the action scenes are a bit blurry and seem to be too close-up, which is a problem I see in most action movies to be honest. Also, it feels like all sense of scale was abandoned. How does a small sports car like a Camaro become four stories tall and appear to weigh 20 tons just because it transformed into robot form? Oh well, like I said, that's nitpicking the little stuff. Even though this film does not quite blow me away like I had hoped, it is a strong, entertaining movie, especially for a sequel. The props are outstanding, with the amazingly cool Chevrolet vehicles, fighter jets, etc. Plus, what's more awesome than a semi truck personified? The sound effects are well done, but this is an action movie after all. Shia LaBeouf has always made me laugh since his days on ""Even Stevens"" and there has never been a more aptly named actress than Megan Fox. As far as the soundtrack goes, I've been really impressed with the Linkin Park songs for the ending credits on both films; they just seem to fit. Despite its long length, the movie flows quite well and makes for a good watch."
"chaotic-dream","8","1","3","6 July 2009"," Good sequel and definitely worth watching
","I have to say I really enjoyed this film, it was much better than I'd originally thought it would be and didn't disappoint in all the things that mattered.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen first and foremost is an action film, don't expect an in depth look into the human psyche or the most thought provoking script of 2009, because (a) these would have ruined the film and (b), your going to see a film about giant transforming robots. The ""humans capability of good and evil"" is thrown in on occasion but nothing over powering, for which I'm thankful. The story of this film ties in really well with the first film, all of the events are plausible and keep into the original idea presented in Transformers 1. This film also succeeded in giving each of the Transformers their own personalities and their own sense of humour instead of just depending on big metal robots breaking stuff to carry the film through. Transformers 2 also managed to easily show the characters want for normality, instead of portraying them as heroes waiting to save the planet.<br/><br/>Annoyingly the government officials were portrayed as incompetent (more than usual that is) but that's only a minor point. There were some pieces (especially a part towards the end) that I thought were just a bit too cheesy and recycled, like the obsession with the dogs, seriously its just not funny....<br/><br/>In summary: Good: plot, actors, graphics, fights scenes, humour. Bad: some bits were unoriginal, probably lasted a bit too long."

","Not a really good movie. Megan Fox was hot. That's really it. I was glad that the blond girl with the stupid accent from transformers 1 was not in this movie! Story was not great, I expected more from Bay and Spielberg. Megatron was shallow, the two geeky cars were stupid; most intelligent creatures and they are stupid, not very likely. The big transformer was not cool. I liked the combined transformers from the animated series (toys), but this one was too big. I could not see what was what. The panther/saber transformer was awesome! I liked it that a transformer could take the shape of a human being. There was no (or too little) character development. I liked the story about prime's ancestors, but I didn't like that prime was out of the picture for a long time. The fight at the end was not great. For the length of the movie, we got to see just a little of the transformers. They should have called this movie; The Sam Whitwicky chronicles."

","I'll agree with most everyone the effects were off the charts and looked great. Whose idea was it to add an un-educated hip-hop Chevy green robots with a gold tooth? Some of the comedy was good and original but the two idiot cars, come on! Totally a Jar-Jar Binks character the two of them, lame idea. It was almost comical that the Hot Megan Fox was airbrushing a bike while straddling it, I laughed along with a lot of other people behind me. Just make it original PLEASE! She would of looked just as hot if she were painting it like a real person! The effects were awesome, the forest fight was by far the best part of the movie. The only time the movie theater was silent really! The rest of the time there were to many people laughing. Some comedy is good, to much and it really disappoints. And I can't leave out the sissy roommate cyber computer guru that was a total sissy, can you edit out his character as well as the two lame Chevy robots. Maybe in the third one they will add a bonafide Alien from area 51..LOL..um Spielberg! He could transform his saucer and turn into a robot Indiana Jones with a laser whip. Overall it was a great movie for effects and new bad robots they previewed, but I would edit out a lot of the movie. I would of shown more of the robots and less humans.

"webmaster-3017","7","1","3","25 June 2009"," HK Neo Reviews: Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
","Tagline: Pure eye candy entertainment <br/><br/>Review by Neo: Smack bucking, loud, noisy, big, and robotic and smashingly hot are automatic words that storm out of my mouth. Seriously, what more does a twenty something guy wants in a movie, hot girls, hot cars and the backdrop of Egypt? If this film is the answer to what works in Hollywood, then the art of commercialism is answered. Director Michael Bay (Bad Boys) is no stranger to big budget special effects flicks and for sure, Bay leaves no budgets unused and no stones unturned. In fact, the transformers are so complicatedly designed that some member of the audience may even watch it a second time or quite simply as my friend puts it, ""let's buy the toy just to see it more clearly"". Pure marketing genius in my opinion, but putting all that aside, this Transformer sequel actually works and despite being 30 minutes too long, it is ultimately entertaining and it leaves my eyes candy coated.<br/><br/>The film follows on from the first film with Shia LaBeouf (Eagle Eye) moving on to college and leaving his super hot girlfriend (the irresistible Megan Fox) behind. As predicted, his college affair will be short lived, as the bad transformers goes after him for some metal specimen that can bring ancient transformers back to life. So together with his hands down sexy girlfriend, Sam goes on a journey and fights a battle alongside the good transformers with the bad transformers.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, I was no big fan of the first Transformers movie; the simple fact is that I managed to fall soundly asleep in the midst of the transformers fighting it out. So for me to remain soundly awake, it must really be something. Perhaps it is the very presence of Megan Fox running around the desert of Ancient Egypt that got me fascinated, but then again, she really is the next Angelica Jolie.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf reprises his role as Sam, the boy who conquered the bad transformers and the one with the super hot car and girlfriend. LaBeouf is a steady improving actor, and since the first Transformers, he has got himself involved in Indiana Jones and Eagle Eye. The only problem with these roles, is the very fact that they are the same, they all require him to be the hero as some sort, and quite frankly, to act like he is intense around his surroundings. Clearly roles that are hardly difficult, but it must be said that he handles them well and even if he somewhat does not deserve Megan Fox or Isabel Lucas, that is actually another story.<br/><br/>To the new Hollywood goddess, Megan Fox, it really doesn't matter that her role in the Transformers series is irrelevant or even unimportant, as she is simply the perfect eye candy solution. When the picture gets a little dull, one glance of Fox lightens up the screen. It's been a while since an actress have that kind of sexiness on screen without even stripping down. It is not hard to see why the world is going crazy over Megan Fox, as she is easily, the hottest actresses in Hollywood right now. Not to shame, Aussie girl, Isabel Lucas (who used to star in the Home and Away series), but she pales in comparison with Fox. She is pretty and perhaps even hot, but when you pit her alongside, Megan, it is just impossible. Fox is bigger in areas that are meant to be and the lips are just plain sexy.<br/><br/>All in all, Transformers is easily a good guilty pleasure to watch and it is probably safe to say that director Michael Bay is the one that can always deliver big budget special effects that works commercially even if not critics' friendly. With more transformers than ever before, adding in the Hollywood myth of Ancient Egypt pyramids being built by Aliens, Transformers is really a lot fun. Yes, the film is 30 minutes too long, it is not believable, but really who can resist a sport car that can transform, the joining power of several transformer, the beauty of Ancient Egypt and if all fails, we still have the undeniable, Megan Fox  (Neo 2009) <br/><br/>I rate it 7/10<br/><br/><ul><li>www.thehkneo.com</li></ul>"

","Transformers revenge of the fallen is a perfect example of greedy and money hungry companies wanting to cash in on a good movies response, and bring in a sequel with no heart or enthusiasm, only putting it out there just to make money. Movies should not be just about money, they should be about plot, life lessons , people you care about, this movie had none of that, while the first movie did. I waited for two years for this movie after i saw the first one because ""transformers"" was an amazing cinematic experience which ended up to be my favorite movie of all time, and i wanted to feel the same feeling, yet again which is why i waited so long for the movie, only to have to sit through a disappointing excuse for a ""transformers"" movie.I know the producers had to rush this movie because of the writers strike and all, but if you want to keep your fans, you should try to at least get a DECENT script first.

It's incomprehensible how a huge crew cannot see the iceberg coming to collide with this Titanic mess. I can't explain too how a great director like Steve Spilberg went aboard this sinking ship.

","It's easy to appreciate a classic when it's established, but few appreciate an original work when it's new, let alone unpublished. Take ""Swann's Way""; Marcel Proust's masterpiece was rejected by every publisher and insulted by the major critics of his day. ""Dear friend: I may be thicker-skinned than most,"" one publisher, introduced to Proust by a close acquaintance, said, ""but I just can't understand why anyone should take thirty pages to describe how he tosses about in bed because he can't get to sleep."" After countless rejections Proust eventually published ""Swann's Way"" at his own expense. Today the novel is regarded as one of literature's finest works.<br/><br/>The point is, the most difficult task for a critic is to appreciate an original work before it is established. Today Michael Bay is regarded as a hack by everyone, but tomorrow his reputation will change. For when the oceans rise, mankind develops gills, fins and the attention span of goldfish, Bay will be New Earth's Shakespeare. He will be our Proust, our Hemmingway, and we will weep salty tears over the calamitous delights he dangles before our mutant fish brains.<br/><br/>10/10 - Masterpiece.

","I usually don't write reviews but I really had to say something about this movie to warn those thinking about watching it because it is nothing short of unwatchable.<br/><br/>There is nothing redeeming about it really. The cavalcade of comic reliefs they bring on screen is unbearable and their jokes are terrible. And they're all annoying on par with Jar Jar Binks. It wouldn't be that bad if it wasn't going on -all- the time but the assault of pointless 'comical' characters is unrelenting.<br/><br/>But it's not the jokes you're after in this movie anyway, now is it? It's the action. Well, the action isn't very good either. It's really hard to tell what's going on as all the Transformers are just a mess of CGI metal. The robots are still incredible acrobats, fast as lightning and completely lack the feel of being massive machines. Or being anything but digital images, really.<br/><br/>I won't even touch the plot. It makes no sense at all and is all over the place. With a runtime of around two and a half hours the movie is way too long to sit through without a decent plot. Or any plot at all. Had they shaped off about ten comic reliefs and an hour of runtime the plot wouldn't matter while the focus stayed on the (albeit, flawed) action. Unfortunately, this is not the case.<br/><br/>I really do enjoy a no-brainer action flick once in a while but this is one of the worst I have ever seen even in that category. What a waste to a legendary franchise and $200 million."
"supah79","4","2","11","22 December 2010"," Dull and dangerously militaristic
","Michael Bay knows his craft. He is one of the best at what he does. But he has become a posterboy for the right-wing moviegoers. I have a problem with his cinematic integrity. His movies are commercials instead of films. Now, Transformers isn't The Great Gatsby. I know that. But Transformers has no story, no soul and has such a dangerous underlying militaristic tone: it presses all the wrong buttons with me.<br/><br/>The movie is aimed at video-gaming 13 to 17 year old boys, with hormones coming out of their ears. Bay sells his movie to these kids with a hot Megan Fox (yes, I agree to that. I am still human), shiny robots and a lot of military showing off. You know, I really don't think the locations in the Middle East and Egypt are coincidence. It conditions young minds that the US can fight battles there. I've read that the DoD wants scripts upfront and can say no to producers when they request hardware for their movies. The producers of movies like Jarhead, Full Metal Jacket etc. got no help. Think they said no to this movie? If the propaganda machine of the DoD thinks it's a good film, what do they think is good about it?<br/><br/>Judging it purely on it's cinematic merits: it has a lot of explosions and pretty good action scenes, even though I couldn't tell what was going on half of the time. That whiny kid from Suburbia looks like a 30 year old playing an 18 year old and Turturro's comedic timing leaves a lot to be desired. The comic relief scenes are sometimes awkward and again: the story is really thin.<br/><br/>I compare this movie and the message in this movie with the prettiest girl in class: She looks fantastic. You can't take your eyes of her. You love her tanned legs, the way her skirt is barely long enough and when she pouts those lips, you just dream away. Just looking at her brings up almost primordial urges inside you. But when you start listening to her and then really looking at her: you will realize she is not that nice, pretty dumb and really a bit dangerous in the way she changes the behavior of the guys around her."

This is very boring staff. Try this: when watching the movie, just listen to the sound for a while, not to the picture, in particularly when the pseudo-metal-alien-robots beat each other to the ground (which makes 95% of the movie time). When listening to the sound, you can actually hear all kind of artificial Hollywood studio synthesizer noise. It is so artificial and non- realistic that it actually contributes to dullness of the movie. I got so bored watching this. Don't let your kids watch it. It's bad taste. It's bad entertainment.

It would be better if an 8 year old was trying to save the world than a college student.<br/><br/>My point is that I cannot believe everyone liked this film and i'm the only one that didn't in my class. The film really distracted me by so much action and the camera moving so fast, that its less enjoyable when you are trying to figure out what is going on. It certainly shows what a complete waste of idiotic acting, over-the-top special effects, and comedy being involved, when a serious situation is occurring like, the world is gonna be taken over by other robots? I would not to ever see this film again."

","The original 'Superman' film had the tagline: ""You WILL believe a man can fly."" In 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen', Michael Bay's sequel to the 2007 hit, you will believe robots can really kick each other's ass. Bay obviously listened to the internet fanaticism and critiques which said there wasn't enough robot action in his original 'Transformers' and that the Autobots didn't turn up until the second reel.<br/><br/>Now, from the very first moments, there's robot Kung Fu in a bombastic opening sequence set in Shanghai. The whole city is almost annihilated by what can only be described as a unicycle Decepticon who warns, before Optimus finishes him off, that bigger, badder things are on the way: ""The Fallen is coming."" From here on out the movie moves at a frantic and frenetic pace, introducing more robots than Hasbro could shake a toy at. In total, there are over 42 robots from both sides fighting it out for the loudest explosion, accompanied by Bay's belter of a soundtrack. And therein lies the rub.<br/><br/>Even though LaBeouf has lots more to do (real-life broken hand or no) and impresses with his acting skills and the parents make a welcome, funny yet somewhat OTT return, there's simply far too much going on. Too much story, too many subplots, explosions, wisecracks and unfocused fight scenes. The story, concentrating once again on the Allspark plus a new fangled Cybertron gizmo, The Matrix of Leadership, and a not-so-spooky foe in The Fallen, confuses and draws out the running time, which could have been cut by 30 minutes.<br/><br/>There are some amazing set pieces, especially when Optimus takes on three Decepticons at once in a forest. A fluid and dare I say realistic action sequence that should nab ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) an Oscar this time around.<br/><br/>Of course, this is perfect summer blockbuster fodder and the first 90 minutes prove that. Plus LaBeouf has grown into the likable boy-next-door-turns-hero type as seen in his evolution from 'Disturbia' to 'Transformers' and no doubt in the upcoming 'Wall Street' sequel, 'Money Never Sleeps'. Plus there's more from the favourite robot characters spearheaded by Bumble Bee and Peter Cullen's trustworthy tones of Optimus. However, even more new robots and characters are introduced as the action moves quite quickly, with little or no reason, to Egypt. The climax takes ages to get going and once it does it's difficult to work out who's who and therefore who to root for.<br/><br/>If I knew that being chased by alien robots would automatically result in an on demand wardrobe change and make-up touch-up, I would have got Dusty Bin to turn on me years ago. It's obvious what Fox's role in all this is, her name being an indicator. If Wonder Woman was out of reach for a female role model, there are numerous Diana Prince type girls Bay could have chosen from. Maybe next time.<br/><br/>Bay does deliver his usual style of pyrotechnics, in Dolby testing sound, but one feels that instead of being like an actual kid in a toy store, he could have delivered in a shorter time and tighter story. Sometimes more is less."

I was surprised in the first 30 minutes that this movie was such a blast, a vast improvement over the original. A thinker of a story, comedy where action was at a null. The trailers are a bit misleading to this movie, they almost give off ""creature awaken from a thousand year old sleep vibe"" but totally goew off a different direction.

","Michael Bay did a great job once again, attracting viewers like flowers attract bees. Unfortunately, Bay thought that if a movie had enough and amazing action, it would be enough for people to love. If you guys like pure action, this is for you. If you like interesting story and character development, find another film.<br/><br/>Although its not the best, I don't think it deserves the crap its been getting. This movie is an excellent part 2 for the first one. The special effects were almost unbelievable. It was very fast paced and kept me on the edge of my seat the ENTIRE time.

"Serenit-y","Null","1","4","18 November 2009"," In clear precise words, what was wrong, and what was right
","========================= OK here are the drawbacks ==========================<br/><br/>1. Too many robots, it's like having too much metal. <br/><br/>2. All you remember about the women in the film after watching it is, There were two hot chicks in the movie one posed, whiled the other played soft porn then upgraded her role by (**Spoiler**) transforming into a robot. (/spoiler) <br/><br/>3. The camera spins around WAY too much, we get it, a lot of work went into transformers transforming, we get it after the first 2,3 transformations, good work boys, now stop milking it <br/><br/>4. Whats with all the slapstick comedy, dog on dog, robot on human shagging, we get it Meghans supposed to be super sexy in this movie, don't need a robot to shag her leg to re-Iterate that, all her constantly perfect make-up enhanced poses, right in the midst of Gallactic robot battles and life threatening situations has confirmed that point already. <br/><br/>5. Which is perhaps one of the worst things about the movie, you realise the Military could handle the Decepticons, without the main actor going on an epic crusade to revive Optimus Prime. If you look at the final battle, 80% of the robots we're wasted by tanks, and the Navy's super secret weapon, which for some reason seemed to only fire once...even though it was sufficient to take out the baddest decepticon.<br/><br/>========= Good bits, =========<br/><br/>and there were, 1. Awesome robotic fights, fully entertaining for about an hour and a couple of minutes,..after that it very quickly dawns on you that it's just slabs of metal hitting each other while the camera swings around. <br/><br/>2. The two ""Hip"" robots, if you actually heard what they were saying, were pretty funny. <br/><br/>3. La Bouf, is pretty funny actor. <br/><br/>4. The cast, with the exception of the women - when they weren't looking hot - Was Sound, not the likes of Edward Norton, or Bale, but well above average. <br/><br/>Conclusion; They shouldn't have restricted Meghan fox to posing, and staring, she's not a bad actor, they should'v given her ""Meaningful"" again ""MEANINGFUL"" dialogue. <br/><br/>Once they realised they didn't care about the story have as much as robots beating the crap out of each other and the art of their transformation, they shouldn't have tried to have a deep story, look at Smoking Aces, simple concept, Assassins kill some random guy, get he's heart, guns blazing, No problem."

This new movie, made by Micheal Bay, is possibly one of his best work. With superb special effects, action-packed fight scenes, laugh out loud moments,& Megan Fox's sexy bod, this truly has the makings of a great movie. Sure the movie has, soft porn, a story line that doesn't make sense, parts that aren't even that funny, & fast paced action that you can't even enjoy some parts, it's really good. When I went to go see this movie, the stands were sold out & the theaters were packed. No movie can possibly top this movie. So don't listen to those lame reviewers.

"mergatroid-1","7","1","4","21 October 2009"," Loved it
","I really enjoyed the first movie. The second movie gives you more of the same. The parental units have become a little more familiar, and I actually enjoyed their antics this time.<br/><br/>They have introduced a few more bots, but unfortunately I don't think we get to see enough of them. There are a couple of wise cracking hiphop ""twins"" that reminded me a little or JarJar Binks (I know I know, but they weren't as bad and don't ruin the movie). They had a couple of ""lady bots"" that transformed into hot mamas on motorcycles, and I don't think we got to see anywhere near enough of them.<br/><br/>They added in a few new bad bots, and one mega bad bot made up of multiple construction vehicles. He was pretty cool.<br/><br/>There was pretty much non stop action all the way through the movie (my kind of movie). And although you may have heard different, the story was fine. Not overly complex, but we do learn that the transformers have been to earth in the past and the Decepticons had actually tried to destroy our sun to somehow gain energon. This was against their laws and so the original Autobots defeated the Decepticons and hid the key to their giant sun killing machine by making a tomb out of their own bodies.<br/><br/>The majority of the story is devoted to the Decepticons trying to resurrect Megatron, chase down the remaining fragments of the Allspark, and find the key to the sun killer to destroy the sun. Of course, the Autobots and main characters have to try and stop them. Optimus Prime is killed along the way and has to be brought back to life because only a ""Prime"" can destroy the original Decepticon (who needs killing REAL bad). The battle where Optimus is killed was awesome. Optimus really shows his fighting skills and kicks some butt, only to be brought down by being stabbed in the back by (who else?) Megatron. There are quite a few new bots, but anyone with half a brain can keep track of them.<br/><br/>I was glued to the screen all the way through. Fun fun fun. Anyone looking for more than fun from a Transformers movie is looking in the wrong place. The worst thing I can say about this movie is that I felt that a few of the battle scenes might have been a little rushed. It seemed there was a lot happening and it all went by so fast.<br/><br/>Hope they make another one. What do you expect, War and Peace?"
"puppygacwhalo","Null","1","4","19 July 2009"," Great movie
","1st of all for all you people that say all the movie is, is robot 1at of all it is called transformers so maybe before you write a review you should learn how to read. Second of all I remember there was only a couple scenes in which a human wasn't in so maybe you should pay attention next time. For all of you that hate the camera work, maybe you should try directing a movie then you can criticize Micheal bay until then shut your mouth. All you critics leaving crappy reviews maybe you should be in the prime target audience, if you even know that means. I'm sure it takes real skill to sit and watch a movie then write a review, you people are a waste of life god get a real job. Back to target audience everyone I have talked to which the age varies from 12 to 30 have loved the movie and seen it more then once. Everyone else I have talked to has at the very least liked the movie. It just goes to show how bad you guys are at probably the most unskilled job in the world; o obviously it was a bad movie right no wrong how much money did it make why don't you check.

"rubensoens","7","1","4","9 July 2009"," Extensive, but worth every penny.
","I've been following the course of this motion picture ever since it was announced. This was because the first movie was really ahead of it's time with the special effects and the slapstick humor. This put my hopes up for the sequel. <br/><br/>I have to admit, however, that when i sat in the theater and the movie progressed, it was quite different from what i initially expected. In most ways, it exceeded my expectations. In other ways though, I have to admit to the various critics, there were some turnoffs. The motion picture was edited in such a way that it became hard to see what was happening. It was fast moving, which is usually OK, but with the combination of the blockbuster special effects, it became sometimes hard-to-follow, not knowing what look at first. <br/><br/>Before you realize what's happening, the shot changes to a different angle, and your mind needs to adjust itself yet again. All in all, a VERY tiring movie to watch in one go, but a fantastic movie if there's an intermission thrown in. About 15 minutes should do it, giving you time to relax your brain. That way, this motion picture is worth every penny to see in a theater if you're a fan of the infamous 'bay-ness'. <br/><br/>I'm sure that when this film is out on Blu-Ray and DVD, it'll be a must-have for every HD home-cinema set, just like the first movie. And because everything is quite complicated, it will allow you to watch this movie a zillion times without getting tired of it. <br/><br/>All in all, a fabulous picture if you like racking your brains from time to time, but not a good choice if you want to relax after doing any stress-related activity."
"owlglass","9","1","4","8 July 2009"," Cool
","Well, just for a change I got to see a really cool movie just a few days after its release (here in Australia anyway), and on what touts itself as the biggest screen in Brisbane; which, by the way, is smaller than the biggest screen in Dunedin, New Zealand. So, take that, Brisbane! Anyway, it turns out (SPOILERS!) that Megatron isn't the real big cheese after all, but there's this creepy megalomaniac dude, lurking somewhere in a giant ship near Saturn, who's really got it in for the 'Primes', of which Optimus is the last. He's also got it in for Earth and humans and all that fleshy stuff. And, yes, he's...well, 'displeased'...and supported by a major phalanx of Decepticons.<br/><br/>The mythology is getting way out of hand, but who cares! As long it supports yet another very cool flick, with lots of real big robots talking and walking like humans and talking smack, but fighting like robots with huge bits and pieces flying here and there and always missing the good guys; a cool basic-hero-this-is-your-destiny dude wisecracking and bumbling, but ultimately being a hero, his way through the story; a sultry female providing him with a foil and more than just support, but almost managing 'equality'; a crack team of our Ranger buddies from the first movie really laying it on this time; some major military hardware being terminally damaged, while other hardware does its America-saves-the-world stuff...all that and the product-placement car—though I do prefer the old, original Camaro from the first movie. Shame on you, Megan Fox, for sitting on Shia's lap and forever taking the original Bumblebee out of the equation with your ""If he's like, this super-advanced robot, why does he transform into this piece-of-crap Camaro?"" Friends of ours had an issue with the first movie, where they thought they spotted—correctly—lots of US military hardware and just generally America-saves-the-world. Well, if they had a problem there, they certainly will this time; tenfold. But should that spoil a perfectly good fun movie; or should all that product placement divert from just enjoying oneself? On the contrary I say. Verisimilitude demands that one is true to what is. There was a brief reference to evacuating 'President Obama' from the White House to some place of safety as well; and the National Security adviser and his presidentially imposed mission was just the kind of thing I wold have expected from an Obama flunkie. Just like the previous president, in the first Transformer flick, was depicted as a bit of an asshole, in that immortal line, requested from one of his attendants on Air Force One to ""rustle me up some Ding Dongs"". You gotta love Michael Bay. He's on good terms with the US Mil and obviously thinks highly of them, and especially the people who do the real work—reminds me of Ridley Scott that way—but I think his opinion of politicians is somewhere at the bottom of an aircraft carrier's bilge. Well, mine's even lower; so good on ya, Michael! Anyway, if a movie is about the present and if you can get money for it by creating a context in which products that actually exist today are being used; what's wrong with that? It's verisimilitude, people; so stop bitching about it, those of you who do, and enjoy the ride, for crikey's sake! Bottom line, XF2 rocked. Haven't had so much just-fun since...well, since XF1, really. I take that back in the same breath: I thought Star Trek was also right up there in the super-geek-fun league, but it was definitely more adult. Movies like XF1 and XF2 will allow everybody, from 7 to 70, to have fun.<br/><br/>There's something—in my case not even 'guiltily'!—atavistically and profoundly pleasurable about just turning off all the dumbwit plot and character analysis mode and what we are told we should think and what makes sense (the Transformers mythology makes none at all, but what mythology actually does, I ask!) and what is A and B and C grade and whatever other crap floats around in your head. It's like a mental holiday; no pressure to think this or that or whatnot; just go with the flow...and when you come out of the cinema and you drive back home, all the cars around you and every bit of machinery, really, start to look...well, kinda different. After the absolutely brilliant homage to Spielberg's classic, Gremlins, near the start of XF2, not even our kitchen will ever look the same to me.<br/><br/>If you don't enjoy XF2, you're either living in a very impoverished universe, or you're just emotionally...well, whatever; or there simply are some things in this world that you don't 'get' and possibly never will. Poor bastards..."
"d-strong-ssa","7","1","4","7 July 2009"," This film shall not be judged by Shakespeare
","Let's talk for a moment on the notion to quote Shakespeare in the review of a Michael Bay film: As children we are raised to appreciate Hamlet, or Romeo and Juliette, or Henry IV ... and yet the appreciation of Elizabethan dialect, iambic pentameter, and Danish teen angst do not come so easily to us. You must be taught to appreciate Shakespeare.<br/><br/>To a film viewer entering an imax theater for a sold out show to Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, much like going to see Hamlet in the Park, you are stepping into a period piece. If you did not grow up listening to Run DMC and the Beastie Boys, and watching Transformers and Voltron on Saturday mornings, the experience will feel like two-and-a-half hours of nonsequiturs over-wrought by a cacophony of metallic crashes, and dialects that would make Buckwheat frown with embarrassment.<br/><br/>But this is a period piece, and to the children of baby boomers and hippies -- and more specifically the children raised by Bugs Bunny slapstick and a sense of ethics born out of the age old battles of Heman and Skeletor -- there is real grace here. If you don't know the difference between Space Ghost and Moltar, or Gloop and Gleep, then it is a grace you might never see.<br/><br/>Film in a large way is meant to be ... at least eccentric, and not a far leap from esoteric. It should be a goal of a film maker to bring light to things that people might miss. Why else would we praise film makers like Fassbinder and Herzog? This noted, Transformers IS dumb. I'll be the first to admit that. But the script by Kurtzman and Orci, and the banter as it's executed by Lebouf, Fox, and Duhamel carry the story as though it had always been a part of the series -- much in the same way the Star Trek revival carried the character of the original series."

Super-smooth cgi where the robots just look real, and in a sense normal. Great new characters with a familiar Megatron/Starscream love/hate relationship however a lot of the new characters lacked depth and were merely there almost at times to fill in background space - that said so are most of the named human cast members. A lot of complaints about racial stereotyping are just nonsense the Twins added value to the story and were a light relief from Prime/Bumblebee stealing the spotlight.

(like my run-on sentences) The effects were also great in the movie, they still do need to slow down the fight scenes and the way the Auto-bots transform, i didn't like how fast they did that in the first one but at least they slowed it down some. i watched transformers when i was a kid, so I remember them, not enough to be a big fan though so I'm trying to make this as fair as possible. another thing i didn't like was how fast paced everything had happened. but it wasn't too bad, unless you truly do want a lord of the rings type movie, i guess they had to condense it some. all in all a good movie, its at least worth a look and to me a buy. great family movie however they did add more language and sexual references than in the first movie but it defiantly made it more enjoyable and less like a ""kids movie""."
"enryberen","Null","1","4","5 July 2009"," Not as bad as they say
","I don't think this movie really deserve an 8/10 vote. But I neither think it deserves a 6.5 average. There's no doubt Trasformers: Revenge of the Fallen is worse than the first one. Yet it does entertain. And when you to go and see a movie like transformers you can't expect a deep and philosophical masterpiece. The first half hour is a bit slow: the prologue is even worse than the first one (and I started laugh when I heard ""Before time began, there was the Cube""!!!), and Sam's parents are less fun. Sam himself isn't that good. But as soon they reach the college, and when Sam starts to go out mad, then begins the best part of the movie: the funniest moments, the best fight (Optimus Vs Megatron & Co.), the best new entry (Jetfire) and finally the come back of one of the funniest character: John Turtutto's! He's - as always - amazing. But when the action goes off to Egypt, it's the beginning of the end. The movie becomes too slow and the final scene doesn't work as it should have. Why? Because we don't have a final battle, but ten or more little fight, especially the final standing between Optimus and the Fallen: too fast, less epic. Surely a script problem, maybe Micheal bay wanted too much, but in my opinion the real problem is another: you can't make a movie such as Transformers: revenge of the fallen in just 2 years. You don't have enough time to ponder what to do, to understand the strength of the first one and to strengthen what was weak. And, unavoidably, you reach this result: an entertaining movie, bigger but worse than its previous one."

The scale was bigger and the battles even better. I did wish that the film did move a bit quicker as the 3rd act was about to begin. The Twins weren't as annoying as other people were making them out to be. Yes, some of the comedy was overdone and forced, but it was a small price to pay for what was an otherwise very good film. The best element of the film was the relationship between Sam and Optimus Prime. It reminds you of the relationship between Luke and Obi-Wan, mentor and student, and even surrogate father-son.

","When I read some of the newspaper reviews abut this movie being coarse and juvenile, I didn't care very much. And I was going IMAX so it would rock. Well, they were right. I didn't want to believe it was written for and by 12 year-olds. I cringed often. And it was still good. During the fights I got chills. They have upgraded the visuals and the Blu-Ray should be incredible.<br/><br/>They really made this movie dumber than it needed to be. I almost feel like I have to ADMIT to liking it as a whole, signifying shame. <br/><br/>Overall it is a drunken movie. Sensory candy, utter sweetness and brain rot.<br/><br/>In theory they should construct a cohesive plot to answer questions. After this attempt I wish they would just leave unanswered questions. A three minute scene attempting to verbally spell out the entire plot is banal and adds nothing.<br/><br/>My main objections are as follows. One, many of the elements are unnecessary and just made me long for the next explosion. A lot of it is tediously repeated from the first movie, such as the parents and air strikes. The twins are racial stereotypes but more vulgar than many, adding nothing but annoyance. <br/><br/>Oh and our armed forces ""gently"" disregard civilian leadership in an emergency situation, which was comforting. Who needs the president and NSA when we have the ubiquitous solution of BRINGING THE RAIN!<br/><br/>And this is nothing new but time continues to be disregarded transport from California, the East coast, Diego Garcia, and Egypt flows to about a brief intermission from any one to the other.<br/><br/>At times it feels like an over-sized, overdrawn advertisement for two of the most bloated government-supported organizations: the military and General Motors. Deleted scenes will surely have Bumblebee leading a feel-good ""This is ooooour country!"" moment while saluting the flag. This is not a huge departure from the first movie but it is gratuitous. Speaking of... Megan Fox basically is a video vixen in this spectacle. Female roles are terrible, we even lack the young techie.<br/><br/>The new Big Bad Villain, in an apparent nod to General Grievous, entered one battle for about 5 minutes and died. The new Super-Sized Decepticon was destroyed by a convenient Super-Size gun in range of Egypt. Oh and the Decepticons are apparently powerless against tanks and aircraft. Or humans on foot if they're main characters. Even hill peoples have Soviet flak cannons and RPGs. And everything was made secret after the melee in L.A.... right. <br/><br/>I still can't give it a poor score.<br/><br/>Basically it's a ridiculous $200M shark with LAZERS!!! And some plot attached as a lamprey, straining to complete a story arc. They really could have done a better job with what they wrote down but the pixels are breathtaking. It's like a thrill ride with long boring waits, or a video game with long boring cutscenes. Waiting for BD.<br/><br/>I have renewed respect for Beast Wars and Beast Machines writers, and I wish they had the same technology and money."

","Okay for all of the people saying how they hated this movie...well please just give me a freaking break!!! what were you expecting when you walked into the theater to see a freaking TRANSFORMERS movie? i mean if you were expecting an Oscar worthy script along with Oscar worthy acting...well then you deserve to be angry because no one should expect that from a movie like this! like i said, the movie did have flaws and here are a few of them: -there was way too much ""oh my god i'm gonna die"" and ""BUMMBLEBEE!!!!!!"" and other truly needless screaming and whining and yelling.. -you can really tell that some negotiations were made to get certain people more screen time...for instance, these next FEW characters got very limited screen time and are actually vital parts to the story and should have been included more in the plot: Optimus, bumblebee,mega tron, the fallen, and lastly jet fire...i mean how in the heck can this guy transport Sam and the gang across the world and then disappear for the rest of the movie? -lastly-a lot of the action scenes were just to short for my own taste but that might just be me! ...now,for every negative thing, there are a lot of positives!!!for example, the special effects are amazing!!! the battle sequences, although short, still make the first movie's battle scenes look like paddy cake in the back yard!!! yeah, the acting isn't great but who gives a crap? it is an awesome movie and it should be watched and viewed for what it is!! not for what people think it should be!!! so for all you people who haven't seen this movie yet, go see it!!!it will be well worth the trip!!"

At some other movies, for example the new Terminator Salvation, their isn't a Arnold Schwarzenegger anymore and that's just sad.<br/><br/>The only thing i didn't liked about this movie was the fact that there was to much action actually, and there were so much robots that i didn't knew who was who sometimes. <br/><br/>But if you like action, hot chicks and cars this is the perfect movie for you! <br/><br/>So enjoy it, just like i did"

I would only agree with one thing, the sexual references were....ridiculous. But to say there was no plot? Well, I can only surmise that the plot was way too complicated and went right over the heads of those money hating movie goers. Meagan Fox can't act? I am willing to bet that any actress who played that part would have gotten the same criticism for simply being in such a movie. And let us not forget Michael Bay, the despicable director who molded this evil movie just to suck a few bucks from millions of unsuspecting movie goers! Transformers 2 is 2 hours and 40 minutes of humor, action and incredible effects. I don't need to defend the movie, the box office is already doing it."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","4","3 July 2009"," The ultimate transformerization
","Yea, I know, there's no such word.<br/><br/>Michael Bay doesn't waste time. Five minutes into the movie, you get all the Transformer action that you have been craving for since a year ago. Before you can fasten your seat belt, you're back in the world of Transformers, together with the human accessories. Two-and-a-half hour is too long for the human story that is somewhat cliché (son leaving home for college, puppy love turn serious etc) and the Transformers story that you neither understand nor really bother to. But that hardly matters. The complete final hour is devoted to top-notch CGI action that should satisfy even the most gluttonous of action junkies.<br/><br/>The degree of emotional intensity of the climax is a little surprising and not unwelcome, as it is done with simple, comic-book honesty. For the protagonists, Shia LaBeouf is very comfortable with his role, and you have Megan Fox who has since been crowned the sexiest woman (in healthy, sunshine sort of persona). As bonus, you have John Turturro back, who doesn't look too different from what he recently did in ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" but that is fine. Most of the other supports are back.<br/><br/>The last word has to be on the Transformers. They have pulled all the plugs in ""transformerization"" – you see them in every form and guise: the Hound of Baskervilles, Yoda (a tall version though), Mystique, Gremlins, and probably more."

"pavis22","9","1","4","1 July 2009"," I don't have the slightest clue what movie theater you people were at or maybe in fact that you did not see the movie itself but it was awesome
","That movie was one of the best sequels I've seen in years, it completely out did the first movie as far as comedy, action, attitude and style. There were so many parts of the first movie that I really didn't enjoy that the sequel made up for. For example, the fight scenes in the first movie sucked you couldn't see what was going on, it got very boring at some parts, they were too quick and just kind of bland. This one had a lot more raw and intense; this movie punched you in the mouth when the main character temporarily died and they picked you back up when you figured out there was hope to bring him back. I believe that most people said the first one was better because it was something new back then, no one has ever seen anything like it before, and with this one it was so much more hardcore and I know that true fans just loved it. This film reaches out more to the people who grew up watching transformers back in 80s more than the older crowd of people who grew up watching the much old hanna barbarra and the original johnny quest shows. I seen comments that haven't made any sense saying that the movie was too loud, there was too much action and explosions, and there was too much metal well duh!!! What do you expect it's a transformers movie. My suggestion for critics and the people who bash this movie is this: if you don't know anything about transformers go get familiar with it look at the cartoons or just read up on it, 2 if you didn't see the movie do not bother bashing it thats like saying the super bowl was horrible and you didn't even watch it nor you have a TV, radio, or computer in your house, 3 everything you say influences people some more than others there are people out there who probably really enjoy this movie but they won't see because you were having a bad day and decided to bash the movie as a way to vent. For anyone who wants proof, solid unbasis proof go watch the movie when there is a decent crowd of people in there laughing, cheering, applauding and having a good time then email me later about your opinion."
"itspeanutbutterjelly-1","9","1","4","30 June 2009"," What did you honestly expect?
","This is less of a review, but more of an addendum for the masses of semi-pro critics that have been slating this film for its overzealous approach to Megan Fox, eye-blistering action and plot shortfalls. I have to ask you, what did you expect? Seriously?<br/><br/>A) It's a Michael Bay film.<br/><br/>As a rough guide, it will include at least 30 minutes of slow-motion, regardless of the run-time, at least 5 explosions, and one exposition- laden speech, (generally accompanied by said explosions...in slow motion).<br/><br/>B) You are all absolutely correct.<br/><br/>As a film, the whole thing is an atrocious work of writing, pacing and lacks any significant depth. The sheer amount of visual and aural stimuli is enough to send most who view this into a semi-catatonic state, a state carefully calculated by Michael Bay to allow maximum absorption of Megan Fox's deadly ""Boob n' Ass"" radiation.<br/><br/>C) *ATTENTION* It is a Transformers film. The entire reason to make this film, is to appeal to the younger kids who have grown up with Transformers, and the slightly older kids, who grew up with the classic cartoon films, and cartoon series. This was hardly going to be a high-brow, thought provoking piece of philosophical mastery, because it is not based on SCHINDLERS LIST it is based on ""A cartoon series developed to market Transforming robots that live in disguise, with a war of Evil vs Good raging on, with humans caught in the middle."" <br/><br/>Do you seriously go into a film based on action-figurines expecting a profound experience? Of course it will be corny, of course it will be cheesy; it is the product of nostalgia, and the only reason that anyone from MY generation, the kids that grew up with transforming Hasbro toys went to see it anyway, was for the iconic *SCHZ SHCZ SHUCHZ SHUZ* noise, and folding metal warriors.<br/><br/>The plot, in itself, is moot anyway. Do any of you remember a single plot from the cartoons? All I remember, is that either they'd be fighting over Energon, or smaller Robots to supplement themselves, and cartoon violence and action would happen in-between.<br/><br/>So Michael Bay, I congratulate you, your mindless action-filled CGI fest, was the truest addition to the Transformer's franchise that you could ever hope for.<br/><br/>And I loved it.<br/><br/><ul><li>Oliver W</li></ul>"
"bub_skaterfu360","8","1","4","29 June 2009"," basically not a bad sequel
","all right. I've been reading a bunch of crappy reviews, so i thought that i would share my meaningless thoughts about transformers: Revenge of the Fallen(by the way very original and non-cliché title). Personally i didn't think the first one was as great as most people say it was, but it was a pretty good movie. Transformers 2 is almost the exact same movie, except everything is done twice as much, and some stuff that is done twice as much as a slightly negative effect on the movie. such as the doubling of their extremely lame and cliché jokes that you hate to laugh at(but you still do because its a fun themed movie). the overboard epicness that the movie is drowned in. Also when the mom eats a special brownie and starts to act like a crazy person. other than those few flaws there isn't a whole lot wrong with the movie.<br/><br/>on the other hand, some of the stuff that is done twice as much is good and benefits the movie,For example, there is twice as much transformers, which is a plus. there are twice as much transformers fight scenes, which is good as well. and last but not least there are twice as many action-packed scenes which is always a plus for a sequel. Overall, i just want to say that this movie may have flaws, but it isn't as flawed as most of the poor reviews i've been reading. Also feel free to make fun of my review as much as you want, because i just wrote it because i was really bored. Also you should see a movie called yo-yo girl cop. you will not be disappointed."

","Transformers 2 i believe had great entertainment. There was plenty of action and special effects and the plot was great. They took the use of comedy and made this movie stand off the charts. It does have a lot of teenage and adult humor, so i would say this movie stand away from children more, but its a movie based on violence anyway. I thought the love story could have been cut down more but it still was a great movie to watch and i plan on seeing this movie again in theaters. I liked the idea of pulling characters who would have been removed brought back in and they even brought in other characters who were not so large in roles to have larger or more important roles. I can not wait till the third movie already, I thought they did a good job on this movie and i would recommend everyone to watch it, that is as long as you have a sense of humor and like action."
"fivesaints","8","1","4","29 June 2009"," Amazing Effects. Good Acting. Where did the magic of the first run off to?
","First, I would like to say that this movie takes the CG, action, thrill, and dynamic awesomeness of the robots from the first film and pumps it up to a maximum level in this film. There were numerous scenes that were simply gorgeous in this movie to watch. The problem I have with this film is certain inconsistencies in the plot and some aggravating points that dampen the film.<br/><br/>First off, the over-dosed comedy in this movie is funny but I think it hurts the movie in the long run with unnecessary random moments where the storyline is taking place to dogs and robots humping each other which doesn't make sense for them to even be there. It was like someone just said ACTION- ACTING- STORY --- HUMP. It doesn't make sense that those scenes were even in there, but it made the movie theater laugh.<br/><br/>The next point that aggravated me was the quick glances and annoying voice over of the new robots, the TWINS. Most people think they add humor and lightheartedness to the film, but if they weren't in the film, the movie would not lose any fiber and would surely gain more than lose. They wouldn't have been so aggravating if they cut 1/2 of their screen time, but they kept randomly putting in these stupid scenes of them during serious parts of the movie and it broke my concentration that I was having getting into the film.<br/><br/>The last two inconsistencies I did not like with the film was some little flaws that could have been fixed. For instance, you have some huge decepticon acting as a satellite up in space and hacks into one of our satellites, but there are hundreds of satellites orbiting the globe being launched since the 50's and the robot would have been spotted. They should have taken some time and shown them taking over all the satellites, but if they auto bots are so powerful they could have flow to space and had some sort of space war with it. Just something that didn't make sense to me. The last part that doesn't make sense is Sam's role. As in the first, he is shown to hold the key to earth's survival and is the important character that everyone relies on, yet the robot's as his friend have never given him some sort of defense or weapon in case he is attacked like the robot girl that almost kills him. I am just waiting to see him given some robotic suit and start fighting instead of constantly running, but that is just a thought.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was good, but they could have fixed some plot holes and made it a little more complex to dazzle audiences. My rating would have been better, if they would have cut some of the random stupid humor that adds nothing to the film. Personally, Michael Bay needs to direct story line sequences with no distractions and keep up the ACTION because he is great at it. The movie was bigger than the first, but loses some of the magic.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"gazzo-2","7","1","4","28 June 2009"," I enjoyed it. Like the first one, just bigger.

You wanna know-was this movie any good? Was it fun? Yes it was. And yes it was.<br/><br/>Sure the humans are 1-dimensional, Sam's family is right outta Family Guy, as well as the jokes(pot brownie/gay dogs/gremlin bots in the house), but you can live with that.<br/><br/>Sure the movie has some really idiotic scenes that go nowheres-the cyborg female w/the metal tongue, the college itself presented as a Penthouse Camp on roids, for example--but it IS pretty entertaining and fun despite itself.<br/><br/>Best parts: *Three way fight in the forest, Optimus dies.<br/><br/>*Whole Jetfire/Yoda character. I had fun w/ that. Nice beard.<br/><br/>*Big fight near the pyramids-the construction bots, the big Kat, the cycles racing around, etc. So much to see and be amused by. Very impressive CGI.<br/><br/>*Better characterizations of the Robots-Megatron, Wheelie, Jetfire, Starscream, etc.<br/><br/>*Megan Fox is just fun to look at.<br/><br/>What's not so good? *Hard to tell what you are seeing in the battle scenes, again.<br/><br/>*Too busy robot designs, you need to really look again to see what's what, for example in the Fallen's lair on Titan.<br/><br/>*Huey and Dewey bot twins are somewhat racial in look/sound, though I found them to be funny, honestly--as did the audience, their designs were...unfortunate, to say the least.<br/><br/>Frankly, if you liked the last one, you Should like this, if you like Bay's movies, you should like this one, if you don't either-stay far away.

","I'm going to keep it short and simple. (sorry for my bad English)<br/><br/>I remember when i saw the first Transformers movie, it was mind blowing when it came to the special effects and it had the little extra touch of humor that made it so special. The second installment starts with a bang you get right into the movie. A lot of movies doesn't work so good with the Hollywood theme ""the bigger the better"" but this one does. It's more of everything compared to the first one the only thing that makes this a little less good is the lack of story but if you walk into the cinema for pure entertainment you will walk out with a big smile, every movie does not need to be some fancy brain work.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie go see it and make up your own mind!"

","Managing expectations, I never expected Oscar worthy acting performances. I expected kick ass action, amazing special effects, fabulous hand to hand robot combats, and Transformers:Revenge of the Fallen brings all that to the table.<br/><br/>The way I remember the 2 decade old Transformers the Movie animated film/video, how robots were fighting, were well portrayed in this flick. Generally good action from beginning to the end, with somewhat passable plot and timely comic relief provided by the humans and even a puppydog like Bumblebee.<br/><br/>I still left the theater feeling very satisfied in the entertainment that I experienced watching the movie.

"lycanhropy33","9","1","4","28 June 2009"," a perfect popcorn movie!
","after reading reviews I've decided that there are 3 types of reviewers. there are the kind who take each movie for what it is supposed to be. there are the kind who like to try to impress people with what they say about movies they know will get panned by so called good critics. and last there are the kind who think they are to sophisticated and to good to watch a popcorn movie not based in reality. I've seen a lot of reviews about the transformers and its sequel and most of them are crap reviews written by people who wouldn't know fun if it bit them in the tail end of their ass. first of all the special effects are beyond anything you have seen in a movie before. of course we expect this from Mr.bay. as with most of his movies he breaks up the overly done action with a slim plot mostly filled with jokes and mindless chatter which is fine. thats how popcorn movies work! there are at least 4 laugh out loud jokes and several moments were giggling will occur. the plot may be thin but i found it pretty easy to follow. why these so called critics couldn't follow it is beyond me. maybe they weren't paying attention? maybe they are getting paid to not do their job? maybe they didn't wanna like the movie before they saw it? here is the story. man has teamed up with the autobots to protect earth from the decepticons. the decepticons are hoping to awaken the fallen with an artifact on the earth that will help their cause. is that to hard to understand? sure the movie is 30 minutes to long and it opens itself up for a sequel with a few plot holes but it was expected. bottom line, if your looking for explosions, girls, action, and some laughs you cant go wrong here. if your looking for something that is for fans of marriage shows and soaps like these dead beat critics, look elsewhere. im sure there is a love story or a story about a cancer patient in the same theater."
"thewo-mail","8","1","4","28 June 2009"," Good but not better then the first...
","If you haven't seen the movie yet, then you may want to go before reading any further... The special effects are awesome in this movie, which keeps you entertained most of the two and a half hours... With that said there are a couple of loop holes in the storyline which really didn't please me. First off the whole Megatron leader of the Decepticons... If he is supposed to be the leader why all of the sudden does he have a master? In the first one Megatron is seen destroying and conquering worlds, but now all of the sudden he takes orders from another bot named ""The Fallen""? The second flaw is the hole storyline of the first movie... Where the cube is the creator of worlds and is supposed to be the main source of power. In the second one The Fallen dismisses the cube and wants to start a machine that sucks energy from the sun which he knows where its located and how to start it... Then why send Megatron to Earth to find the cube in the first place... The third flaw I found was Optimus, since when is he so powerful... In the first one he basically struggles to take on Megatron and in the second one he takes on three or four Decepticons including Megatron... Don't get me wrong this movie is very entertaining but once you start to put the first and the second one together it just has some holes that make it questionable... Lets hope the third one redeems the Transformer prestige."
"johnnie02","7","1","4","28 June 2009"," So different,
","To see the Transformers not in cartoon motion is so different, especially if you are a big fan of the classic ones. In the last part, it was good to see the new detailed versions of the transformers, although it was off the track from the classics, but it was descent and a good movie.<br/><br/>The new part however is so different, it feels like the new series is going to be ruined, and won't last more than another movie (if it survived). One of the most disappointing things is the lack of transformers original character's behavior, it is becoming so American with many ""funny"" comments, especially for the Autobots, which is so different from the original characters and not good at all.<br/><br/>As for the action, it is a good thing to have too many action, but the big problem is that you will not know who's with who! And there is a specific scene near the end where you will get totally confused, there are too many characters, many of them didn't appear in the classics, and so you have no clue who they are, and you won't know what's happening and what's the role of every character even when the fight is over!<br/><br/>The human involvement is one of the biggest holes in the new sequel; it is supposed to be a robot war, with no involvement of humans, in the first movie it was OK, but in this one, it is not OK at all. The spotlight is for the very most of time on the human characters and their lives, to the point that makes you feel you're watching a ""human"" movie with a ""robotic"" involvement!<br/><br/>Imagine the old series to be done in present days with the new graphics achievements, and maybe adding some very little human involvement to spice it up, would't that be wonderful? I really hope writers, producers, and directors start thinking about what people really wants not what they see people want.<br/><br/>Conclusion; go watch the movie, it's worth to be seen, but don't watch like a classic transformer fan, just as an action movie fan 7/10 for an action movie 4/10 for a transformer movie"
"edspring19","7","1","4","27 June 2009"," Good action film, Less than desirable plot and execution.
","I went to this film feeling that I would be entertained similarly to the last one. It was exciting watching the great battle sequences, but when the plot slowed down to incorporate the human characters it was just uninteresting. Megan Fox's character was nothing more than eye candy, like the first film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the earth and the transformers having met before the all spark. Megatron is revived using one of the remaining shards from the cube. And he apparently is no master, but the apprentice of a fallen Prime, hence the Fallen. The plot has little coherence with the previous film. The story is completed when the decepticons attempt to activate ""The Machine"", which collects energon and is capable of similar feats to the all spark. Optimus Prime is the only one who can stop the fallen, being a Prime. He does so in rather handy fashion and the movie is left open for another sequel.<br/><br/>Beyond the action sequences, the addition of the twins, who act much like rednecks and receive far too much screen time, and RC, the only female transformer, has no influence but to create a more congested world of transformers. <br/><br/>The film, just as the first one, must be watched moving from one fight sequence to the next, the in between muck is not worth paying attention to. If you expected more out of Michael Bay you would be sorely sorry with this attempt to create a masterpiece from a beloved franchise.<br/><br/>The action sequences balance out the lacking back story and below average acting. The CG is still amazing."

","I don't see why so many people are giving this a bad review. Even thought there wasn't much of a plot, all the action and humor let me enjoy the movie. So far i've seen the movie twice and will go see it again. I thought that it was action packed and really funny. there was some crude humor but its funny. There is a lot of good jokes, both times when i saw it the hole theater was laughing hysterically at parts. It might not be the best movie to see with young kids though because there is a lot of swearing and the scenes at the college with all the girls aren't the best for kids. As a family movie it fails but for a summer action movie it is very good. For all the people that say there is to much explosions and you cant tell who is who pay better attention because everyone i saw this movie with understood everything fine. Michael Bay did a really good job directing a movie that almost no plot at all into a pretty good action movie."
"pet_labrador","7","1","4","27 June 2009"," Mr. Bay hats off to you.
","How to spend 200 million dollars in 2 ½ hour? Michael Bay knows better than others. This movie sets a bar on the technicality for future movies. I agree with the lack of plot and acting performance, but one should also remember that making the plot too intense would have forced Mr. Bay to divert his attention, time and money from the superb action sequences. This movie is like a good chick flick where you do not have to apply your brain except it has superb action sequences. So put your brain to rest for a while and just enjoy the human feat that has been achieved by the special effect guys. Hat's off to special effect guys. Before watching this movie, I was told that this movie is bad and I had the same perception, but it became thinner with the progress of the movie and I must say I enjoyed the entire movie. I have hard time watching a movie which is more than 2 hours long, but the storyline of this movie is fast and keeps you involved till its last frame. Movies like a transformer suffer from legacy problem, since they are derived from a cartoon series which have more than 50 episodes under their belt, and viewers have high expectations from it. Though these movies provides a great assistance in creating a plot, but at the same time also forces the director to give more importance to the theme, which in case of transformers is robots. Therefore I believe that expecting a plot like Batman or Lord of the rings will be injustice to this movie. This movie is lot better than Pirates of Caribbean (2 -3) and Spiderman (2-3). So it's a must see movie that too in a theater. One suggestion to the future viewers, do sit as far as possible from the screen, otherwise you will have hard time watching it because gigantic robotic action. It's worth the time and money I spent for the ticket."

Meanwhile Optimus Prime (again brilliantly voiced by Peter Cullen) and all the other Autobots team up with the military to hunt down and destroy the Decepticons. In the sequel, the Autobots truly know how to fight. I'm not kidding, Decepticons fall left and right: three of which are killed by Optimus Prime. An old nemesis returns, and an ancient one called ""The Fallen"" returns to earth with the intent to conquer and destroy. <br/><br/>There are two reasons(one for each star) why I award this film 8/10 stars. With a much larger budget it seems the transformers are the main characters and the humans are reduced to supporting roles, including Shia Laboeuf. While I am glad that there are more character moments for the Decepticons, it defeats the purpose of making this a live action movie. The other reason is that director Michael Bay's attempts at humor don't always work. In fact they can be painful to watch at times. Such as Sam's mother getting high from eating marijuana at his school. Also there's the Autobot twins Mudflap and Skids. With their street gang accents they can be funny one moment and annoying the next. All in all, it's worth a viewing. Just don't expect anything ground-breaking, thought-provoking, or original. But It's a real treat for kids, action and science fiction buffs, and Generation one Fanboys. Long Live Optimus Prime!!"

","Some spoilers may be here:- I am not even gonna comment on other peoples critics or review as I simply don't care. The first film was brilliant and I walked out of the cinema so satisfied, 11 out of 10. Well this time I watched it with my elder brother and nephew, 9 to 35 years old and we all loved it. This time I walked out feeling 12 out of 10. The greater amount of robots, their on screen time, the well written plot, the references to transformers lore. I read some critics and couldn't believe they said it was 4 out of 5 etc. Well this film really delivered everything I wanted and some more. Those people who said it didn't have enough plot are so wrong. The first film already laid down the origins, this time we had more answers delivered to their origins and more action. The robots were fantastic. The human actors were great as well with character development and the humour was brilliant. I saw it at an Imax cinema and it was awesome. The only thing is that there was so much happening on screen all the time that I couldn't take everything, but this is brilliant due to the watch again factor will be excellent. I simply can not wait to watch this film again and I can not especially wait for it to come out on blueray. Michael Bay and his team have done well, so Has Steve Jablonsky with his score. What a film!!!!!"

","Go and see the movie for what it is: an action packed film with some comedic relief.<br/><br/>Don't go expecting this *perfect* plot, or *no* cheesy lines blah blah blah.<br/><br/>its a movie based on a line of toys people, come on.<br/><br/>My Review:<br/><br/>Revenge of the Fallen did what is needed to do, it packed a lot of action, and silliness into the film, although it was perhaps a bit lengthy. It gave a great sequel the first Transformers, and anyone who liked the first installment has no reason to hate RotF.<br/><br/>The CGI, and effects were great, but its Michael Bay, you were expecting that, and he delivered. The plot in my opinion was pretty good. We learn a lot more about the history and lore of the Transformers which is fun. Shia LaBeouf, does a wonderful job, as does the rest of the cast. John Turturo's re-appearance was great to see, and he was a blast.<br/><br/>The humor is similar to the first movie, although i noticed a lot of forced crude humor, which may give you laughs, or it may not. But either way, I guarantee you WILL get laughs out of this film.<br/><br/>As i said before, just go watch the movie. its well worth your money, and your time."
"darkmax","8","1","4","26 June 2009"," Too fast too many
","One thing I realize after watching it half way through, there were so many Transformers that many of them were more like cameos.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, as with the first one, the acting fair, the CGI is good. as expected, and the story well-paced.<br/><br/>As an old fan of transforming robots back in the days of the good old Japanese animes, I think the 'bots in both of these movies are overly complicated, even for realism sake. They should have Shoji Kawamori do the designs for Star Scream (he looks like a flatten toad).<br/><br/>The female lead lacks any sort of depth and is almost paper-thin as a character. All she portrays is the sex, nothing else. Heck! the dogs got more on-screen actions. The Australian, Isabel Lucas, had more steam screen than Megan Fox.<br/><br/>Other than that this movie is worth your money."
"kami_kitten","7","1","4","26 June 2009"," What do you expect?
","It appears that most critics have dismissed the latest Transformers movie simply because it's a Transformers movie. They seem to be saying something along the lines of: ""this is an awful film and I can't believe everyone is still going to watch it and it will still make lots of money."" Well really, what did they expect? This is not full of drama and amazing acting, this is not going to teach you a moral lesson or change your view of the world. This is a popcorn movie intended to show you lots of explosions and exciting action scenes, and on that count Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen succeeds brilliantly. Why should every film be about perfect acting and drama? Why can't we be allowed to enjoy a popcorn movie without being called stupid? Why are the so called 'smart' films so acclaimed, while the popular films that keep the movie business running are ridiculed? I could complain about this forever, but instead I'll describe the film. Firstly, the storyline. You don't need to have seen the first film to understand what's going on, although I suppose it would help. The plot is certainly not simple but as with most films like this you don't need to follow the plot to understand what's basically going on: bad evil robots trying to destroy the world while the good robots and humans try to stop them. It's far more complicated than that, there were a few moments when I lost track of what exactly was happening, but you can still enjoy the film nonetheless.<br/><br/>The acting is alright, there were no moments that felt out of place. The parents were both superb, completely hilarious at all the right moments yet able to switch to serious and terrified when required. The two leads were also good, Shia LaBeouf felt natural while Megan Fox was perhaps used more for her looks than anything else. There were a few moments that were obviously placed just to show off how perfect her body is, but I'm guessing the male half of the population won't see that as a fault. There are also some fun new transformers added to the cast, and the voice acting is excellent. There are a lot of supporting characters, many of them get some great one liners, some however felt a little unnecessary, but they're all played well.<br/><br/>As for the CGI, it's simply astounding. The mind boggles at the thought of how much work went into this film and how much it must have cost. Every detail is perfect, every action scene gloriously orchestrated. This is a film with so many explosions, so many guns and tanks and jets and, of course, transformers, that not a moment goes by when you're not entertained. Is it used in excess? Are the special effects the only reason to see this film? Perhaps. But why should that be a bad thing? I went in to the cinema expecting to be amazed and I was.<br/><br/>It's not all positive. There are some jokes that fall a little flat, some moments that feel contrived and the end is a little predictable. It's probably not as good as the first movie. Yet the critics are wrong, this is not a bad film. It set out to be an action film with great special effects and it is certainly worth seeing if you enjoyed the first or just want to see explosions. Maybe the fact that everyone is going to see it and it's going to make a lot of money should prove that the critics' definition of a 'good' film is sorely lacking. Whatever the case, I for one am looking forward to hearing the inevitable news that there will be a Transformers 3. If the special effects are getting better and better, I can't wait to see what they're going to do next.<br/><br/>My score: 7/10"
"lghnichols","9","1","4","26 June 2009"," FORMS a great a movie
","Potentially the winner of 'Best Special Effects of the Year' Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a masterpiece combination of max-adrenaline action, high speed, and in-your-face impact battle scenes. Expanding its previous prestige record, the new box-office hit introduces slick new Autobots and even meaner and stronger Decepticons. But without a doubt, the special effects department take the gold medal of all STAR ratings. Undoubtedly, the realism each robot brings to the screen is enough to repay your ticket with 'excitement'. Unfortunately, the presence of young and genre inexperienced, Shia Lebeouf, lets the movie flow down two STARS from 10... Amazing Movie, 8*/ 10*."
"kevinwang612","8","1","4","25 June 2009"," Great transforming sequences and excellent animation
","Transformers was hands-down the favorite cartoon of my childhood. I watched the first film 3 times, so of course I was excited for this film. I planned to watch it 3 times before even seeing it. <br/><br/>After watching the film I agree with many. The plot is thin and the acting is lackluster. The Bad: Megan Fox begging for the ""L"" word constantly was really pointless. Sam's mom acting like she was on crack was unnecessary. The ""terminatrix"" was totally out of line with the transformers concept. Devastator getting wiped out by an ion canon from thousands of miles away and not even being able to destroy the twins. Megatron being a pawn to the fallen instead of a master-mind was also a bad idea. Wheelie humping Megan fox's leg was unnecessary. <br/><br/>The Good: The Shang-hai scene was awesome, with constant fast action and most importantly, Transforming. Prime's 1 on 3 battle was beautifully done as well. Prime using the gun parts was an awesome concept. The soundtrack was awesome as usual and really helped with the mood of the movie. <br/><br/>Suggestions: They should have made ""megatron"" the mastermind and use the ""constructacons"" to build a secret weapon to either destroy the ""autobots"" or harvest Energon. The final scene should involve devastator ""devastating"" the autobots and human resistance. After it seems virtually impossible to take devastator down. Sam takes the all-spark fragment to the space and aerial museum and summons the ""aerialbots"". The next scene, 6 planes fly in and combine to form ""superion"". The two giant ""tranformers"" should the proceed to battle and smash through pyramids and perhaps the Sphinx. The autobots and decepticons will then come to a stalemate and Sam revives Prime to save the day. I'd watch THIS file 10 times."
"hikingmike","7","1","4","25 June 2009"," Great movie with flaws
","First, let me say I REALLY loved the movie, really. However, there are a few things I saw that I did NOT like. #1, near the end, I know I saw a short, maybe a few seconds, of 2 scenes from the first movie. A shot of the Raptor (that should have a prop-engine but has a jet) and a shot of the AWACS radar plane. Also, that same scene looks like it was filmed in the exact same spot. #2, how did they break out of a door of the Smithsonian in DC into a plane graveyard in the desert? #3, I know movies are not allowed to have perfect military uniforms, but as in the first Transformers, they really, really messed up the Army uniforms, BAD. But don't let this review stop you, I still really enjoyed it!"

","For those of you who are expecting brilliant acting, emotion and Oscar winning performances and find yourself sitting in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen ask yourself, what the heck am I doing here? There are no plot twists, you should be going to Transformers expecting exactly what you should be expecting... to be entertained by action and special effects.<br/><br/>And transformers brings to the table just what your looking for. The special effects in this movie are amazing some of the best I've seen, certainly enough to keep many entertained. For those of us who are looking for a little more, Transformers brings with it many hilarious anecdotes(I would say almost too many) that will have the theater in an uproar.<br/><br/>This film can be enjoyed by many generations and we get to see those childhood cartoon characters that we grew up with a little more real. Many can share those childhood experiences, with their children that are now just discovering Transformers. It's an experience that can be enjoyed by the whole family.<br/><br/>So when you go watch Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen do us all a favor and put down your critics notebook and just be prepared to be entertained... it will make the experience that more enjoyable."
"ARTaylor","6","1","4","25 June 2009"," A Popcorn Film
","What I mean by popcorn isn't the stuff you take in the theater with you, but that like popcorn the film has little nutritional value. That's what Michael Bay does. He doesn't make wholesome stuff like Dark Knight or Wall-E. He isn't trying to. Why? Because we eat it up anyways. Should we expect better? Yes. Should we eat better? Yes. Are we going to stop? No. There will always be a place for popcorn and the Michael Bay film.<br/><br/>Michael Bay. You either tolerate him or you hate him. He is who he is and he doesn't try to be anyone else. I don't care for him but don't hate him. If you've seen his other films you know what you're getting. They are all basically the same loud explosions and hot women. His films should be better, and would be if they were handled by someone else, but if you take them for what they are they're usually enjoyable.<br/><br/>This film is more of the same. If you saw T1 you know what to expect. If you loved the first you'll probably enjoy this one. If you didn't care for T1 your opinion won't change. Some stuff is better, some is worse, and some is exactly the same.<br/><br/>What's better?<br/><br/>Now that we know the story the movie dives right into good old robot action. Now instead of five minutes of people being told what's going on they can just do things. They don't have to explain who Optimus is, he can just transform, roll out, and kick butt.<br/><br/>Bay figured out how to show the bots fighting in the film. Last time the camera was five feet away and you couldn't tell who's foot or arm that was and what was going on. This time Bay pulled the camera back so we could see the robots in their full glory. A vast improvement.<br/><br/>Speaking of robot action, Optimus kicks serious butt. In the first he had two fights, one was too short and the other he was mostly losing. This time he's taking on three at once and he's fighting enemies twice his size. Optimus fans won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The Decepticons actually get their own scenes and get to do more than just spout a line or two and randomly destroy things. Megatron and Starscream get more bickering. It's not quite like their original series appearance but they do more than in T1.<br/><br/>In T1 the Autobot's dialog, especially in their intro, were too campy. This time it's much more real. They're not talking like an 80s cartoon anymore but like someone from today. There's no Optimus saying ""My bad.""<br/><br/>What's the same?<br/><br/>Plenty of big, fun, loud action sequences. If you don't like those things, why are you going to see a Michael Bay film? It's what he does and he does it well. The explosions and CGI look top notch.<br/><br/>Megan Fox continues to be the best looking character in the film. Bay isn't afraid to show he is a man. He clearly loves making hot women look sexy. More than he likes making robots look cool.<br/><br/>Bay can't figure out what to cut from the film. There's still too many scenes that distract from the plot and go on far too long. There was Sam looking for the glasses in the first, and there's Judy getting high in this one. Bay may love that character and think those scenes are the best but they could have been cut down and the movie would flow so much better. I just wanted those scenes to get over with and move on. There's a dozen scenes that simply go on too long that could have been cut down and gotten the same effect. A half hour could have easily have been cut.<br/><br/>What's worse?<br/><br/>The Twins will go down as Bay's Jar Jar Binks. Like Jar Jar you can't help but notice the racial undertones. Bay's reasoning that he wants more personality in the bots is a poor excuse for useless racism. Like Jar Jar they pull attention away from other useful bots. They serve no purpose in the story other than to be funny. Like Jar Jar their humor is poor and pulls attention from the successful humor of Bumblebee. Bumblebee was a great comedic relief because it didn't come off as stupid, but this time he has few funny moments.<br/><br/>There's about 40 bots in the film but only 8 or 9 are explored in any way. It's nice that they included more fan favorites but not when you rarely see them let alone hear them speak. I would have much preferred that Arcee taken the Twin's places in the story. She might have given Mikaela someone to talk to rather than complaining. While Starscream and Megatron have more time all the other returning bots have less.<br/><br/>This movie is all over the place in terms of plot. The first was simple: find the Allspark and protect it. This film they're trying to defeat the Decepticons, protect Sam, find a couple of different objects, destroy some machine, and defeat the Fallen. Problem is there's so little plot to begin with that dividing it up makes it worse.<br/><br/>The first one blew me away because it was so much better than I thought it would be. This one is about what I expect from Bay. I enjoyed it but not quite like the first one. The first one I wished that there were a few things better. This one I wish there were a lot of things better."
"frozen-14","8","1","4","24 June 2009"," Might not have lived up to the expectations of a sequel, but surpassed my expectations
","Transformers in 2007 was a movie that really made me feel like I was the age of 10 again. It reminded me of one of my favorite toys back then. It had a good mix of action, plot and comedy.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was good. I would not say it is fantastic because this film has too much of some things and not enough of others.<br/><br/>First off, it has way too many unnecessary sexual references, a robot which can disguise as a woman like the Terminatrix (What the), adorable robots, robots that talk like rappers, psychotic middle-aged woman, and did I mention too much explosions? I know Michael Bay is known for his works with meteors raining down on earth (i.e. Armageddon and also referenced in an episode in South Park ""Imaginationland"") but this movie has seriously way too much explosions to make up for its plot. Not that the plot was bad. It was good in fact.<br/><br/>Next, the lack of Autobots appearances from Ironhide & Ratchet and the pathetic assault by Decepticons did not help the film. Every time the Decepticons look like they were going to do lots of damage, they don't. It also seemed like the humans were more efficient at doing damage on the Decepticons than the Autobots.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the things that made this film good were certain fight scenes (e.g. the one in the forest or Bumblebee doing his thing). I was happy to see certain elements of the film which reminded me of the Transformers cartoon movie back in 1986 (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Transformers:_The_Movie). Namely appearances of Shockwave, Devastator, the Matrix of Leadership and the somewhat good ending I would give this film a 7.5 star rating, buy the DVD, and watch the sequel because I love Transformers. It would have been a better film minus certain unnecessary scenes and tweaking the explosive scenes just that tad bit. However, I wouldn't be able to name any other director other than Bay who would be more suitable for this movie. You can't please the whole world right? So heck, watch the movie, feel like you're 10 again and tell us what you think."

","I can certainly see why someone who isn't a true Transformers fan may not totally get this movie. Having said that, it is impossible for me to understand how someone could watch the trailers over and over and be totally shocked when it is jam packed with action. That is what you get with this movie. One of the most common complaints I heard about the first one was that the human element was too heavy. That is no longer an issue in this one. The Autobots and Decepticons dominate the screen this time around. The battles are epic and memorable. There are many things in this movie that fans of the cartoon will get and the casual fan will not. A fan of action movies will not be disappointed with this film. I'm ready for the third one!!!"

","MODERATE SPOILERS (not too much, won't ruin ending)<br/><br/>Okay, let me start of by stating that I am a 15 year old boy old. I am very mature and i see almost every movie... but don't let that stop you from reading my review.<br/><br/>Also, let me say that I have been FREAKING OUT for this movie since I saw the Superbowl TV Spot.<br/><br/>So today I saw it at IMAX, which some recommend, but I'll tell you it gets hard to concentrate. Anyways, I was spazing out waiting for the first clip to start. Right away i had a feeling from the prologue that this wasn't going to be what I expected. <br/><br/>I guess I should'nt have read the reviews that said the opening scene and forest battle are the best because I found myself disappointed in them.<br/><br/>The thing that REALLY disappointed me in this movie was the lack of slo- motion. Yes it may be cheesy. But when Michael Bay gives you a scene in slo-mo that is so cool it makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up, that's a success.<br/><br/>I'd have to say my top five favorite parts were:<br/><br/>1. The explosion. Slo-mo, with Megan and Shia running gave me the chills.<br/><br/>2. When sideswipe kills sideways in Shanghai. The was so awesome<br/><br/>3. Prime shooting Megatron with that cannon.<br/><br/>4. Ravage attacking the base.<br/><br/>5. The pretender.<br/><br/>Basically I'm going to give you a run-down of the pieces of the movie.<br/><br/>Action: 9 out of 10. Great action but not enough slo-mo<br/><br/>Story:9 out of 10. Better than I expected.<br/><br/>Romance: 10 out of 10. Great.<br/><br/>Adventure: 10 out of 10. Enough said.<br/><br/>Comedy: 5 out of 10. I thought the film was hilarious. But when Leo and the Twins stepped in, it ruined it. They are both EXTREMELY annoying.<br/><br/>So here's the summary...

"RCWjr","8","1","4","24 June 2009"," Bigger, badder, bawdier
","Right off the bat, let me get something off my chest. Enough with the over analyzing of films like this. These are films based on comics turned to an animated series. The film and it's predecessor were created by a director who is not hired to give in-depth, character driven award season fare. Given all this, anyone going into this film expecting anything more than explosions, robots, glory shots of pretty people, the latest military toy, comedy and bits of drama, need just stay home and watch The Piano or something else. Your opinion is null and void to the masses who are headed to this film for all the glory a film by Michael Bay with robots, military and pretty people delivers.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is cliché sequel. The action and comedy are twice the level we got in the first film. The CGI is absolutely incredible to watch. Yes, at times, it is hard to distinguish robots, this is not due to quality, but just the shear numbers of robots involved. The runtime of 150mins has been commented on as being one of the negatives by those choosing to write negative reviews of the film. This is a non-issue. There is so much going on that if you are checking your watch, you shouldn't have purchased a ticket in the first place. This is an all out assault on the senses, and I say that in a good way. Those going into this film for the pure spectacle are delivered the goods and then some.<br/><br/>Actors/characters are pretty much ported over from the first film, minus a few supporting characters and addition of a few new ones here and there. Everyone involved gives everything to the action and it is fun to watch them having fun. Shia and Megan would in any other world/reality seem like an unlikely couple. But in this Bay universe, their pairing makes sense and both actors have a chemistry with the other that helps sell their relationship. Sam's parents this go around are even nuttier and they even share a very nice moment late in the last act. There has been much made of two new autobots being cartoonish stereotypical to the point of being offensive. Are we really going to cast stones from a glass house when there are film series like the ""Friday"" movies which are far more insulting and stereotypical? <br/><br/>Utlimately, this film is about the robots and it can be said without any hesitation that the Autobots and Decepticons are delivered above and beyond. It is a glorious site to see Optimus really show why he is the leader of the Autobots. The first film his character really didn't get a chance to show his muscle, here his strength is maximized and on full display.<br/><br/>I have read complaints about the comedy being too much here, whatever, the comedy is what really helps the film stand out. The audience I saw this with was having a great time and that is ultimately what these films are about. The original cartoon series has a lot of funny moments, most unintended. The comedy here is intentional and welcomed. <br/><br/>All in all, a great evening at the theater enjoying some absolutely fun and exciting images. Headed to see it again."
"wspeedc","7","1","4","24 June 2009"," Great for what it is
","Everyone needs to understand that this movie is not going to be nominated for best picture of the year. Shia LaBeouf is not going to win best actor. It is a summer box office, popcorn flick. In that category this movie excelled. It could have had some better autobot/decepticon development, but the action, CGI, and humor were all better than the first. Don't give this one a 5 out of 10 because it is not The Godfather. Of course it isn't. Give it an 8 or above for its category because it definitely exceeded my expectations, and overall I was entertained. I thought that was the point of going to this movie, to be entertained."
"viper1651","8","1","4","24 June 2009"," Great!! - but not as good as the 1st
","Michael Bay successfully captures the reason Transformers was such a hit - the awesomeness of the bots. The effects, action, and simply this unique version of superheroes is just really really cool - I could watch bots transform into fighter jets in mid-air and fire missiles all day.<br/><br/>Even though the plot was in place really well, and the acting was about the same as the first...the attempt at the teenage love story, the climax, and the conclusion were rushed and failed. The build-up to the finale was overdone, and the finale itself was way too short.<br/><br/>I did miss some of the bots from the first movie which I thought were a lot cooler, and a lot less PG-13 rated (cursing/racial jokes were unnecessary).<br/><br/>Overall - if you liked the first one, go see this one too! Action-packed, funny, and overall a pretty good summer blockbuster."
"Joejoesan","7","1","4","23 June 2009"," 120% Explosions, 75% entertainment
","When will Michael Bay learn that sometimes less is more? In the Transformers sequel there are so many explosions, transformations and robot fights that you soon reach a point that you almost don't care anymore. I say 'almost', because as a big budget action movie Revenge of the Fallen surely delivers... for the fans.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so are plain bad. The story starts out in the past when we see Bionicle-like Decepticons inhabit our very earth. Jumping to the present the movie treats us with some childish humour (a crying Bumblebee? Come on!) before it really kicks off at the university. Our hero Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) has a close encounter with an incredibly hot female student. Too good to be true, of course! But the lady turns out to be a lethal Decepticon and a few seconds later the big chase/escape/adventure begins.<br/><br/>When the Decepticon invasion starts invading our planet and something terrible happens to Optimus Prime the movie gets interesting. The special effects are first rate (the sinking of a big marine ship, the Decepticons under water), Megan Fox looks incredible sexy, Shia Labeouf has some great funny moments and John Turturro... well, John Turturro is as neurotic as he's always been.<br/><br/>Too bad that the movie is about 20 minutes too long and that there are so many fights and explosions that they cannot make a big impact anymore. The direct confrontations between the Autobots and Decepticons are so unclear that you never know which one is winning or gets damaged. Thank God Michael Bay sometimes uses slow motion.<br/><br/>I guess something pretty drastic must happen in the inevitable Transformers part III to keep the franchise alive. Because although this sequel is a great spectacle it showed nothing new. Except maybe the fact that some Decepticons can disguise themselves as humans - like in Battlestar Galactica. <br/><br/>If you enjoyed part 1 you will certainly enjoy this one too. But this sequel will not win the franchise new friends...<br/><br/>7,5 out of 10"
"jdesando","Null","1","4","23 June 2009"," Nuggets of humor
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is vintage Michael Bay (remember Armageddon and Pearl Harbor) with explosions every other second, dialogue lost under the noise, and a plot so derivative you'll wonder why you're in a showing of King Kong Meets Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>No matter, the audience loves the audacious pyrotechnics, vacuous plot, and Megan Fox in short shorts on top of a motorcycle—perfect for summer. Though not intricate, the plot is varied from Sam (Shia LeBeouf) going to college leaving behind the foxy Mikaela (Megan Fox), the Autobots landing out of a job protecting earth, and the rising of the fallen. Not one thread is deftly or deeply handled, but surprisingly in between the explosions are nuggets of humor if not lost to the noise. For example, on the college campus Sam's parents quip: <br/><br/>Judy Witwicky: Look at this place! I feel smarter already! Can you smell that? Ron Witwicky: Yeah, it's the smell of $40,000 a year...<br/><br/>Well, it's not great humor, but the moments of chuckles put it leagues ahead of this summer's Terminator Salvation for human interest if not depth of characterization. <br/><br/>In addition, fleeting reference to swine flu and Obama remind us that even such a superficial sci-fi as this has hopes of greater meaning than just action. If you feel good about cars morphing into monsters, you may be the critic to see this film as an allegory about the monster car industry eating up bailout money or girl friends looking like Megan Fox dutifully waiting for college-bound nerds like Shia LaBeouf. The possibilities are endless, as are Transformer flicks, I suspect.<br/><br/>Bay is Bay, a director who understands the taste of an action-lusting summer audience.<br/><br/>Hey, it's summer. Lighten up and enjoy."

","For starters I enjoyed the film... mostly. There are just a few issues that really stood out in my mind after the screening. <br/><br/>I would have to say that the film makers must have decided to ignore geography. We the audience are not stupid. I know that it is a movie, but when you make a movie that takes place in the ""Real World"" you can't exit or enter a building in one city and all of a sudden be in a totally different ""obvious"" location. Or even time of day for that matter, without some sort of explanation. <br/><br/>On top of the lack of correctly placing world landmarks in the proper geographical locations and distances, there was a serious sense of forced humor. In the first film the humor was just there, it fit... in this film it's forced on you and feels a bit off-putting. Transformers 1 (2007) and for the most part this film, depicts the Decepticons as a serious threat to mankind and tries to take it seriously. That makes the dialog for some of the characters need to really be re-written. It didn't fit with the overall feel of the films.<br/><br/>In addition, I noticed throughout the film that several sequences ended or were somewhat out of order without being explained... It left me asking, ""whatever happened to so and so?"", or ""Why did they say that?"". I could understand if those were the parts in a film that would be answered in a sequel... but these weren't those types of situations.<br/><br/>Also, in the first film each transformer was unique. I could not tell who was who in Transformers 2. I was really hoping to see somewhat recognizable characters. It almost seemed like they did a bit of cut and paste to fill some sequences. I thought I even saw characters used in Transformers 1 that had been killed off It made me wonder ""did they get brought back and if so when and how?"" It did make for more action on screen, but I could have dealt with less and still been okay with it.<br/><br/>I think with a few additional scenes that explain certain situations as well as a re-edit and a bit of re-scripting (can you say ""re-scripting the Twins""), I could give this a 10. It was good... The fight scenes were cool. I am probably going to see it another time to see if I missed anything... but, it could be SO much better with a little more work. <br/><br/>Go see it and let me know what you think of it."
"Tweekums","3","3","23","22 February 2010"," Over long CGI-fest
","To be fair I must point out that this film was my introduction to the world of Transformers; I've not seen the first film nor the original TV series. Since this is a sequel it can be forgiven for not spending too much time introducing the characters or explaining the back story of why the two groups of robots are at war, even so it was not difficult to figure out who was good and who was bad and what they were trying to achieve. If the idea of watching CGI robots beating the living daylights out of each other while Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox try to prevent the bad robots achieve their evil aim then you might enjoy this. Unfortunately the story never really grabbed me and I found my self thinking ""is it nearly over?"" when there was in fact another hour to go and while the action was pretty much non stop the fact that is was CGI made it feel unreal. I may have missed something but I was also rather confused by the films geography; one minute they are in the Smithsonian in Washington the next they are in an aircraft storage facility, another time they are in Petra in Jordan then after a bit of running about they are in Egypt, it was as though Michael Bay just wanted to destroy some well known Middle Eastern landmarks and assumed viewers would think they were within walking distance of each other.<br/><br/>It is hard to comment on the quality of the actors as all they had to do was run around avoiding the bad CGI Robots. The good robots were somewhat annoying, some of them were given characteristics which were presumably meant to be funny but just made me hope they'd end up scrap metal. It is clear that Michael Bay's expertise is in action set pieces and not in characterisation or comedy although the fact that his films rake in vast amounts of money suggest there must be lots of fans for this type of thing; I'm not one of them though."

","After a really funny and enjoyable start into the movie franchise, the Transformers come to a full stop. Digitally and technically they are well made. We even get treated the same guys that made the first movie work. So what went wrong then? Quite a few things I'd say and I'm going to list them ...<br/><br/>Story: Apart from the fact, that it's a pretty simple premise, do we really need a complex story for a summer blockbuster? I would say no, but having it be completely ridiculous like in this movie, is way beyond, what audiences should accept.<br/><br/>Actors: While we really enjoyed them the first time around, they're not getting real screen time here. And when they get time to talk, the talk so fast, that you wonder how they can follow their own thoughts ... Don't try to understand everything then? Yes and it is a shame. Having an explosion/action sequence every 2 minutes isn't really helpful, especially because you're not getting anything out of the characters.<br/><br/>Transformers/CGI: Actually this is one thing they did pretty good in this movie, hence the 3/10 instead a 1/10. But even the great effects suffer from ...<br/><br/>Editing: We should be used to MTV cuts by now, but when you have two robots fighting each other, 100 cuts in 10 seconds tend to confuse you rather than give you something you can enjoy. A shame then, because as stated above the CGI is really great.<br/><br/>A shame this movie couldn't really be the summer Blockbuster we all anticipated (G.I. Joe took that spot) and I won't even go into plot holes and other crazy stuff, that just doesn't work in (favor of) the movie! And that's why I actually canceled a second viewing, that I had planned, before I even watched the movie. It would just be too painful!"
"GeorgeRoots","3","1","5","7 December 2013"," Autobots MEGA U-Turn NOW!!!
","Michael Bay surprised us all finally with a somewhat, well executed live action adaptation of the ""Transformers"". Clearly it was the beginning of a million dollar franchise, that after viewing this piece of crap would only be renowned for stereotypes and horrendous dialogue (But still very impressive CGI).<br/><br/>Reviewing this in three acts. SOMEHOW that giant city battle at the end of the first movie, that was witnessed by thousands SOMEHOW has been covered up by the government (How?).<br/><br/>Act 1: Cue horrendous romance between teenage-angst poster child Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), and walking boobs Mikaela Barnes (Megan Fox). His ridiculous comic relief parents take him to college, where the mum gets high (Y'know for kids) and bids him farewell. Act 2: Optimus Prime continues to recruit more Autobots to his cause (Even racially sensitive twins apparently), whilst destroying the scouting Decepticons who eventually gain the upper hand through the mysterious ""Fallen"". This leads Sam to again help fight this intergalactic war. Act 3: No doubt a visually stunning finale of a battle sequence, WHERE THIS APPARENT ULTIMATE EVIL IS DEFEATED WITHIN 1 MINUTE BEHIND A BRICK WALL! All wrapped up in seconds, as if they had to cue credits three minutes after.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Even by blockbuster standards, what happened Michael Bay? There's insulting an audiences intelligence, but by delivering something so inferior you would have been better off giving us the trimmings of the cutting room floor. I apologies to fans of the franchise, but I cannot help but feel this will KILL the franchise for you as it certainly has for me. 3/10."
"darth_timon","4","1","5","23 May 2013"," Weak and Unimpressive
","Unlike the first film, which was moderately entertaining, Revenge of the Fallen is a mess. The chaotic battle scenes are even more chaotic, making it hard to figure out what's going on, and the film once again falls into the trap of too many human relationship scenes, missing the point of the cartoons completely. The transformer designs are even more monotone than before, Bumblebee's speech problem, despite being annoying in the first film, is still there, and it's as though the producers took all the flaws of the first movie and deliberately made them worse. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>Good points? To be honest I can't really think of any. Shia Lebouf is not a bad actor but doesn't have a lot to go on here, Megan Fox is as stiff as a board, and it just doesn't work."

","I've been a long time fan of transformers ever since I was a little kid, and so far i've read things from most people that make a lot of sense, the acting was pretty good, the story wasn't bad although it annoyed me, as it I never once remember the matrix of leadership being a key to using the energon harvester, but besides that, the movie wasn't too bad, some people thought the robot designs were horrible, personally I disagree but I can see why one might think so. One big problem though that I don't see people pointing out, is look back to the Devestator scene; which in my opinion they really messed up Devestator; right before Devestator was formed, you see all the constructicons, but one thing was, they had Bonecrusher, and Bonecrusher was killed in the first movie, also during the battle scene near Optimus' body, they had some of the constructicons out fighting the Autobots, even though Devestator was still on the pyramid. All in all though, the movie wasn't horrible, there was just a lot more they could have done to make it right, pay more attention to the little things."
"butterflywoman6","8","1","5","3 January 2010"," A little disappointed
","I watched this movie last night with my daughter and was really disappointed. The movie itself was great - the action was superb and the story line, pretty interesting for a movie of this sort.<br/><br/>But... I was disappointed that within several minutes of the movie beginning they had already shown two scenes with dogs humping, then went onto to fluff the movie with terms such as pussy, don't suck the sack (nut sack) scrotum, balls, and an additional scene with a robot humping Megan Fox's leg. Oh and the male thong butt shot at the end of the movie was just the icing on the cake.<br/><br/>To me and my daughter, this was not funny. It made both of us uncomfortable. I don't understand why people have to ruin perfectly good movies by putting this kind of trash in them. The men that run the studio which put this movie out are grown men with families. Is this the way they were brought up? I think that they became who they are today by the way society of their day shaped them with moral values, family values and a little common decency. Why must they try to ruin future generations with their perverted sense of 'art'? Can't they make movies without that crap in them? Transformers would have been a perfectly good movie without seeing two dogs humping, a space robot humping, and all the stupid genitalia terminology that they felt necessary to throw in as well.<br/><br/>Come on movie makers - stop degrading our society and our children. Make something worthwhile without the warped so-called humor you feel the need to shove down our throats at every turn. This is exactly why it has taken me until now to even rent another movie - I give up on Hollyweird ever making something worthwhile that I can subject my family or myself to."

MB has gone for the trend of recent of ""bang for the buck"", basically CGI/SFX over what made the series so accessible/relatable to myself as a ""80's"" kid. Don't get me wrong, the effects are amongst the best effects of very recent memory but its just not as good as the 1st ""Transformers"" movie in terms of plot development/character development. At the end of of the day, he has made a movie that appeals to the money market/economic market rather than a movie that should/would bring existing fans/newcomers to the series."

","I recently watched Transformers 2 and to be honest, I was highly disappointed. The movie started off nicely enough but it appeared that the Director kept on pulling the movie as if saying not yet...not yet...<br/><br/>It was like each time you finally felt that the movie is rising steadily and would soon reach a crescendo, the tense situation was dampened by some silly comedy or some other sub-plot springing out of nowhere. I never felt seriously moved for the characters and never cared enough for what happened to them. People were dying...robots were dying...there was a lot of things happening but everything was too messed up to really create any sort of impact in an emotional manner. Therefore even though the movie was visually better than the previous installment and had more sinister villains and a seemingly better plot device it was never able to generate enough interest...it never reached the epic level.<br/><br/>The first part was way better just because once the movie picked up it kept on going higher and higher in terms of drama as well as action. You felt that you were being sucked into the situation. Over here, you never felt the same energy.<br/><br/>Shia Lebouf was good in the role of Sam Witwicky. I think he's a very good actor. Megan Fox was okay in whatever she had to do. But as i said it was not charming enough. The sidekicks were forgettable. The chief villain (Fallen) was not portrayed as well as was possible and Megatron looked a little insipid (almost child-like).<br/><br/>Go for it only if you have a taste for heavy metal action, high pitched sound and some cool special effects. If you are looking for a some cinematic excellence, it can avoided."

","I just got through seeing Transformers 2 on DVD. It was not as good as the first one which was a decent film, not a great film. The one thing which stuck in my mind through the entire time was how it was directed towards teenagers. While I was seeing Transf2, I was trying to estimate the viewer age the filmmakers were directing their product at, not a good thing when you're supposed to be taking in the storyline. I settled on 14. Transf2 contradicts its own target audience because the main character is supposed to go to college, not Jr. High.<br/><br/>The dialog was childish, the behavior was childish, and I definitely felt I had rented the wrong film. Some of the script was especially ridiculous, particularly involving John Turturro while he was on the Pyramid. Transf2 had very little credibility.<br/><br/>There is a generally accepted premise in Hollywood that most moviegoers are teenagers. It's probably true. This is why many movies are directed towards teenagers. Transf2 is a product of this premise. I was expecting Transf2 to be at least as good as Transf1. I was disappointed and some parts were difficult to watch because they were so childish. You may read this and think, ""What can I expect? After all, Transformers is derived from cartoons."" They still could've written the script better and made it more sophisticated. Titanic was well written and in 1998 drew more than $1 BILLION worldwide in ticket sales! All I can say is, I am glad Transf2 only cost me $1.67 for renting it rather than $10.50 plus $7 for snacks.<br/><br/>They really need to inject some new blood into Hollywood. They keep hiring the same people! I see on IMDb there is going to be a Transf3 and yes, Michael Bay is going to direct it.....yet again. I may just skip seeing it.<br/><br/>3 OUT OF 10 STARS"

All to often I was left not knowing which robot had just pulled the arm off which other robot and I got a headache trying to watch the fight scenes which is such a shame...Guys slow it down, make it viewable and you're on to a winner.<br/><br/>The plot itself is a very childish and lends little to the imagination. The cgi and the robots themselves sprinkled imho with all to limited humour work well and it's worth watching the movie for the all too infrequent shots of a scantily clad Megan Fox and the other female colleagues alone...<br/><br/>As far as sequels go, they generally suffer from the lack of novelty that their predecessors have, and T2 is no different. If I've seen a car turn in to a robot and turn back in to a car once, I've seen it a thousand times and it becomes all too samey.<br/><br/>At best I'd have to say the movie is mediocre and at worst some of the shots in the final Egypt location scenes are more reminiscent of Power Rangers than a Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>Some of the editing imho is a little strange, the role of the guy who takes over command on the orders of the president isn't fully explained and you start to think he has some sinister involvement, especially as he gives away some vital information to the decepticons, but he's quickly forgotten about and you can't help thinking there was a cut made somewhere....<br/><br/>All in all an OK movie that lacks depth and credible storyline, aimed at a slightly older teenage audience, it's far too childish in nature so I'd probably have to advise potential viewers to wait for the DVD release rather than pay over the odds to see it at the cinema."

The sad thing was however, but for a few memorable scenes, I didn't miss anything in the movie during my leisurely walk to return the fluids I had borrowed to the theater receptacles.<br/><br/>Okay, it wasn't a complete waste of time of a movie. There were glimmering moments of fun dialogue and the ensemble cast had their strengths: Shia LaBeouf delivered his lines in his charming stumbling manner, Megan Fox's lines were few, Josh Duhamel and his soldiers were awesomely flexing the might of military know-how, and John Turturro saved the movie like Superman with his monologuing and fire direction.<br/><br/>But what happened to the stars of this movie? The freakin' Transformers! Sure there were more of them that did more stuff, like ones that turned into a big ol' bulldog that chewed dirt, or an old one that walked with a cane, or even a little remote controlled truck that humped legs, but most every new interesting Transformer ended up being an outrageous gimmick. Hadn't the writers been warned of what happens when you get too gimmicky with cgi creatures? Hasn't anyone taught them the lessons of Lucas and Jar-Jar Binks? Unfortunately no. And what about the titular villain, The Fallen? How about the Fallen and couldn't get up. Megatron was more sinister and dangerous in the first movie as a frozen NBE-1. Then, we come to poor long-suffering Optimus Prime. Was it wise of me to yell... ahem... ""Go Go Power Rangers!"" in the theater at the end? Maybe not.<br/><br/>All of this, however, would have been fine if the movie's plot was stronger. Instead it meandered and tried far too hard, pushing perfectly good characters beyond their limits instead of relaxing a little bit and letting scenes play out without going overboard. The writers seemed to fall into the trap of sequels, getting cutesy and adding length to the film instead of substance. More, bigger, brighter, but definitely not better.<br/><br/>There are some beautiful portions of the movie that do make it worth watching and prevent it from going over fully to 'wait for HBO' ranking: the grueling battle in the desert with soldiers and orange flares, Bumblebee kicking butt, a good score, and John Turturro are among the few. But it is not enough to give it better than a 6/10 and a 'Wait for Video' Rating."

The first Transformers movie relied upon a time tested formula for the action movie genre: Action, sexy women, hot sound track and light hearted comedic moments.<br/><br/>This time around follows the same basic formula however this time it just doesn't come together with the same result. I think the main let down lies in the story which sees Shia LeBoeuf return as Sam - still the socially ackward teenager this time starting college - but on the way absorbing knowledge about the location of a second Transformers energy source. Megatron is revived (remarkably easily) and the race is on once again.<br/><br/>The plot line has so many holes in it as to be considered swiss cheese. Introduction of new characters fails entirely by making the new characters incredibly annoying (Autobot twins); and favourite old characters are not given enough screen time to be considered important.<br/><br/>There isn't much positive about this film - even the ever lovely Megan Fox cant do much with her role. The action scenes are even faster paced than the original making them at times hard to follow.<br/><br/>I understand that a Transformers 3 has been inked.

Just the comic relief bots like Bumblebee, the (really bad designed) Twins and Wheelie. WTF? The Twins would be annoying enough in the background, but why the hell do they have such a big part? For the schoolkids? OMG, the first one worked without this. Bumbleebee is way enough of that stuff.<br/><br/>So if you want to see good bot vs bot action, besides Optimus Prime owning three major Decepticon Players in under a minute, go watch the first one. You can see the best non Prime fight scene, Sideswipe owning Sideways, on youtube. If you want more comedy and dull Atuobots than in the first one, go watch Revenge Of The Fallen.<br/><br/>The Special Effects are still great, Megan Fox is still hot as hell and Prime is still cool.

","It would appear as though the rule of the sequels still prevails: the first movie will be better than the second, which will be better than the third, etc. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has not broken out of that pattern at least.<br/><br/>What makes the second movie worse than the first one? Mainly, the plot. In the first movie, the plot, while a complete sci-fi, was at least gripping and made sense. In the second one, the plot fell into the fairy tale like areas, with secrets, resurrections (3 of them, by my count), magic-like stuff under the guise of technology... bull. Complete and utter bull. And the resurrection at the end... was lame (yeah, that's what the Romans said. :-)). Seriously, even I could've found a better way to return Sam Witwicky.<br/><br/>The acting was worse in this movie too. Megan Fox and Shia Labeouf were a lot more energetic, funny, and believable in the first movie. Now they aren't horrible, but they don't have that same spark anymore. The humor is a little strained, the terror and tragedies a little fake... a little worse, here and there. The rest of the acting was... eh. The only really bright spots I saw in this movie were John Turturro and the guy who voiced the old airplane-transformer (I don't remember the name in the movie, therefore can't find the actor.) The rest of the acting had no absolutely horrible spots, but no great ones either.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie had some great spots (breaking into the museum, mommy on drugs) and some horrible ones (the aforementioned resurrection). But two things it had throughout and that was how it looked and it's energy. It is a non-stop adrenaline rush from beginning to end, and as for how it was made... it would blow you away even on a small screen. The film doesn't stop moving. There's always something being blown up, shot, hit, crushed, blown up again, etc.<br/><br/>Should you watch it? Yes. It's worth it for the energy and the special effects. But if you do not watch it... well, you're not missing much. 5.2/10 <br/><br/>I heard that there is a 3rd one coming out... don't know if I'm going to watch it. Rule of the sequels..."

","Transformers the sequel is a perfect definition for the word overrated. It is has been highly publicized so it will inevitably be a blockbuster but I personally did not like it.<br/><br/>I actually find it quite boring, usually explosives and awesome digital effects aren't boring. But when the movie is all that, yes it is. I almost fell asleep! There was no clear story, it's obvious the movie is just about showing off effects. <br/><br/>But I won't say I didn't enjoy it at all. The characters are awesome, I enjoyed when they actually were involved in talking to each other (Probably 10-20 lines each, that's for the main characters) Other than that they were just running around with explosives everywhere.<br/><br/>By the way there is a huge error in this movie, apparently the two main characters ran -on foot- from Jordan to the pyramids of Egypt in like an hour. Are they serious? Those to places are not even close, it would take DAYS or maybe WEEKS to go there on foot.<br/><br/>5/10"
"pmistry","3","1","5","10 July 2009"," movie review from a realistic perspective
","I'll start with a few mental notes I took down within the first 10-15 minutes of watching Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Potential spoiler alert but really, you shouldn't care) <br/><br/>->Terrible intro, not the opener that incites a lot of enthusiasm for the rest of the film<br/><br/>->Special FX produce a cool vs OMG that was freaking awesome of the first film <br/><br/>->Reallllllllllllllly, those are the lines you were told to speak and you didn't question them? <br/><br/>->What's up Prime, all of a sudden has a bad attitude and talking junk not the leader I left knowing in the first one <br/><br/>->The transformers (robots) apparently have lungs as their breath in the cold is shown several times. <br/><br/>I can't comment on the plot, because there really wasn't one worth talking about. I can't comment on the acting, except for Shia Labeouf who still cracks me up when he talks, because the robots do most of the fighting, and the people just run around and stay stupid lines. There's not a lot of substance to really go on. That said it still made over $300 million and probably still has another 50 mil left to go in essence, Michael Bay is a genius. This is not about critically successful, award winning, movie vault forever films; it's a summer popcorn big budget, big production, big action blockbuster that you go to see cool stuff (i.e. see crap blow up and chicks that are unattainable to the average man). In that light, mission accomplished. Go see it for two reasons, still somewhat cool special effects, and the body of Megan Fox and others as you follow them across the screen. There's really no other reason to see it. Skip it and go to a bar, where you may see a fight, and hopefully there's a few hot chicks around to stare at. The flick's only future purpose on Blu Ray may be to test out your new HDTV and surround sound."
"Kraush","2","1","5","8 July 2009"," A very disappointing follow up to a fun first film
","(I don't really know that anything I've written can be considered a spoiler but I do reference some minor scenes) This is a very dumb, loud, long movie. I could end it there but there's some things that need to be touched upon. Admittedly the first film isn't exactly Oscar caliber, but it managed to be humorous while also dazzling you with it's special effects. This movie on the other hand is so over the top ridiculous that I almost couldn't believe what was occurring in some instances; including, but not limited to, Sam's mom tripping on pot brownies at school, two gratuitous shots of dogs humping each other, stereotypical Italian and African American accented robots, and of course all the crude sexual humor you can cram into 2 and a half hours. Michael Bay is a man child, a perpetual 13 year old who just likes to blow stuff up, film incredibly attractive women and utilize humor that's about as tasteless as you can imagine. Now I'm certainly not above all these things when it works, but the movie has no real story, the plot is so idiotic and contrived that it's tough to follow at times. The characters are paper thin, and even the robots aren't that interesting (is Bumblebee ever going to have his own voice). Now don't get me wrong, it was an entertaining experience to be dazzled by how much money Paramount apparently gave Bay, because believe you me there are lots of explosions, lots of destruction, and some awesome CGI. But that's about it, and once the novelty wears off the movie basically deteriorates into a video game experience. Perhaps the most annoying aspect is how heavy handed Bay would get at certain moments of peril, complete with dubious slow motion and such a serious tone that you can't believe this is the same movie that five minutes ago was talking about robot testicles. I'll leave you with the thought of what John Turturro looks like in a thong, because you will have an answer to that query if you go see this film."
"Otoboke","Null","1","5","7 July 2009"," The cacophony of nothingness.
","When watching a movie such as Transformers 2, it is undoubtedly hard not to be bedazzled by all the glitter that flies at you every fifteen minutes. Whether it's the pristine CGI work that glistens with a glisten only glistening diamonds could pay for, or the high-name actors, director, writers and just about everything else involved in a production bigger and grander than your wildest imagination—well, sort of. You see, despite the fact that a single cluster of pixels within a single frame of Rise of the Fallen's two and a half hour tour de force of computer generated action, explosion and all abound balls to the wall ruckus fest is probably worth more than the car you drove to see the thing—despite this overarching sense of Hollywood spectacle, glamour and Event phenomena that so often surrounds major productions such as this, the overall effect is akin to finding a very large pastry that has taken the form of a succulent meat pie... without the meat.<br/><br/>Yet following in the footsteps of an original feature that just about stunk to the high heavens in spite of its major budget and fancy effects, even the most optimistic of primes wouldn't be at fault for suspecting foul play at hand here. Even more unsurprising however is that Transformers 2 isn't by any means an improvement on its predecessor; sure enough, it makes everything bigger, blows more stuff up and achieves being a landmark in terms of cinematic effects, but is it any good? No, it's not. Following on almost directly from the previous feature, this follow up reintroduces the familiar faces of Optimus Prime, Megatron and Sam Witwicky and brings a few more into the game just to ""freshen"" things up a little. The story, which takes about the length of a regular film to actually get moving, is slow, plodding and completely uninvolving. As usual, the basic threat is that the evil robots want to destroy the Earth and humanity along with it, and all the humans, good robots with senses of humour and a Kid With A Destiny attempt to kick all those party pooper robots back to where they came from. Ho-hum, right? Well yes, but then again a lot of action blockbusters take on the same basic premise and make it work. So what makes Transformers 2 the flat pancake of ideas that it is? Simple; there are no real characters here, the plot takes far too long to develop beyond anything rudimentary, and the special effects—although dazzling—take up far too much screen time away from those characters and story-lines that we should be paying attention to.<br/><br/>As much as I like to play the characterisation horn however, there remains the question of how, if even possible, these men and women that occupy an adventure story so grand as Rise of the Fallen could ever truly steal the screen away from those fancy pixels. Well, the answer lies not too far away with writers Orci and Kurtzman's earlier blockbuster hit of the summer, Star Trek. Although far from perfect, Trek was an example of action done at the whim of character and plot rather than the other way around. Sure, it might not be quite as dazzling as Bay's outing here, yet Abrams also stood on firm ground by revolving his tension and climaxes around character conflict and tangible action. With Transformers there's an unsettling amount of irreverent inconsequence inherent to its lack of will; the pieces on the board move around on their own, change shape and have it out with each other, and yet there is little emotion or thrill to all the gun fights and flying shards of scrap metal. The characters—if you can even call them such—are just as useless.<br/><br/>Yet it could be argued that each franchise stands on its own separate ground. With Transformers you have Bay and Megan Fox and in Star Trek you have Kirk and Abrams. When Fox struggles most of the movie to make more of an impression than her CGI backgrounds (and rather ironically too often looks even less realistic than most of them thanks to her excessive makeup fit for a circus clown) and the many feigned attempts at romance between her and co-star LaBeouf feel overly stilted and blasé, it isn't hard to see that the very palette that the film-makers have to work with here is very different. But then again, Fox in a way perfectly embodies the movie perfectly—nice to look at sure, as long as you avoid the suntanned puffer fish clown face and the whole, personality thing that's missing underneath. When it comes down to it, Rise of the Fallen is certainly this year's biggest movie, but it's also one of the most disappointingly trivial. Between expansive fight scenes and wise-cracking robots, the landscape portrayed by mega-star director Michael Bay here is lifeless and completely uninteresting. Those who crave nothing more than CGI robot kung-fu will lap this popcorn-fest up with vigour while the rest of us will simply have to sit back and try to ignore all that cash going down the proverbial drain. Yet that is, surprisingly, Transformers 2's biggest success—the comedy. Again, Orci and Kurtzman provide an amusing amount of comedic relief for audiences to breathe within throughout, giving the movie lighter, much more engaging side. Yet even so, the biggest pun here unfortunately is the cacophony of nothingness that is Rise of the Fallen with its endlessly pointless and forgettable drivel that permeates this multi-million polygonal excuse for a movie.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","Alright, so this was something I was looking forward to. A graduation celebration. A few of my friends, and myself, bought tickets to see it midnight, opening night in IMAX. And it sucked. I honestly felt like crying. $15 bucks each. I was expecting it to be as good as the first. Well, that's not entirely true. I read some reviews of it, and let's just say I had a bad feeling walking into the theatre. But, I figured I'd give it a chance. Large groups of people have been known to be wrong before. Just look at religion. But no. They were all right. It was a bad, bad movie. It felt as if the plot was something they added on after making most of the movie. Sure, it had awesome fight sequences. Sure, Optimus Prime is a god. But everything that made the first a great movie (other than what I just mentioned) was missing. You don't relate to the characters at all, instead you get to see two , small, yappy-type boy dogs humping, as well as a small transformer humping Megan Fox's leg. And let's not forget the giant, robot testicles, eh? They spent more time on cheap, retarded gimmicks for cheap laughs than they did on character development and whatnot. Don't get me wrong, the robots were humping awesome. Jetfire was my personal favorite, and I loved Alice, but that's about it. I haven't really watched any Michael Bay movies, but this seems to be a perfect representation of what everybody says about them. Two-dimensional eye-candy. Also, I haven't watched the show, so I don't know if this actually happens, but Optimus Prime really should not be doing Arnold Schwarzenegger-like one-liners. It just makes it even crappier."

","I will not write a long review, since there are so many other reviewers speaking the same language as me. But as you may have figured out, the legacy of how sequels are worse than their original continues. Transformers 2 not only sucks really bad, it does so in a whooping 2,5 hours. I don't recognize at all the series and one movie I fell in love with back in the 80s. Lame decepticons, even more lame autobots, story is awful, the acting is even worse. The only thing which is partly OK is the score, which sometimes drives the action more forward than everything else on the screen put together. I'll just leave it at that. The whole product sucks, from beginning to end. Not the worst movie I have ever seen, but being on my top 10 list of worst movies ever, can't be good."

","Noticed some negative comments and some very positive ones. This film seems to polarise opinion.<br/><br/>As for myself, I loved this movie. I still like dialogue and plot, and some people have queried this in this movie, but the dialogue and plot seems to parallel the first one, just more so. I have no complaints, it is faster and snappier but not necessarily better or worse. I didn't mind the humour, it's supposed to be a fun movie!<br/><br/>And as for the action & special effects- couldn't believe how much of it there was. This is to be expected of as a sequel which doesn't always make it better than the original (eg. Jurassic Park) - but I thought it was better than the original.<br/><br/>My personal opinion. Suspect the average rating is lower than it should be because some people are giving it very low scores. I suspect this is a distortion based on expectations. There's no way this movie could have rated a low 1 or 2 out of 10 if taken as a stand alone movie. I'd personally rate it a 9!<br/><br/>Some have quoted that they grew up with Transformers and this wasn't as good. I too grew up with them in the 80s.

","I am a huge fan of the first Transformers movie, and even own the DVD, so was really anticipating a step up...something that was going to totally rock the Transformers franchise. Man, I left the theater very disappointed. When people would ask me how the movie was, I had to be very honest and tell them ""Go see it for yourself, but I was disappointed."" I say that, because although the action scenes and special effects were pretty awesome, though maybe a little overdone, the acting, dialogue, plot, jokes, and just about everything else were just completely awful. I almost hope that they don't create a sequel. If they do, they need to just totally make up for how they damaged the Transformers name in this flick. Now, again I cannot speak for everyone, because the audience I was with all laughed, whistled, and cheered all through the movie, and all stood up and clapped when it was over. I'm sure there were some groans and sighs, too. I don't even want to know how many parents had to cover their kid's eyes and/or ears in some parts, or if they even bothered at all. In other words, this is not the family-friendly movie that it might appear to be. Keep in mind, this is coming from a Transformers fan. I really wanted to enjoy it, but just couldn't. Fortunately, I viewed this movie for free (someone else wasted their money on me), otherwise I would've been even more upset. I hope this review helps."

","If you're looking for a movie that makes you think, or challenges you, don't see Transformers 2. It's a self acknowledged all-out effects movie, and gives little of its time over to plot or character development. What it does have is spectacle, excitement and appeals to the kid in all of us. Explosions, robots, Megan Fox, this movie was never going to be Citizen Kane and it knows it. But if you want two hours of epic dog fights, buildings getting levelled and Megan Fox straddling a motorcycle you'll have a great time, anyone who criticises it for it's lack of plot is asking a little too much from the transforming alien robot genre (and Michael Bay of course)"

The plot was WAY drawn out and the main Transformers weren't even in the freakin' film.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe it. The main characters were replaced with trash talking twins. It was super annoying and HUGE disappointment. I know that the premise of the film was supposed to be about the Decepticons, but if they're battling the Autobots, then shouldn't the Autobots be in the film? The director and the writers of this film should slap themselves in the face. After the movie was over, I looked at my significant other and said ""I want my 2 and half hours back."" I only wish that I could have gotten a refund on my ticket. It makes me sad that I contributed money to such a horrible film. I guess it wouldn't be the first or last time I do that.

All of what I said is true but there is still a lot of robots fighting each other. But most people saw this movie because they thought Megan Fox is sexy and they would probably go on IMDb pro and get her address and send her letters asking y if she would send them a picture of her breast or asking her if she would have sex with them. But most people I know saw the movie because they like Megan Fox like I stated above but then again they would see it because the movie is full of action.

"robert-clutton","4","1","5","5 July 2009"," Lazy Sequel
","I was really excited about seeing the new Transformers movie but I can't help but feel disappointed with it. I felt that the reason why the first film was successful was not the strength (or lack thereof) of the plot but the relationship of boy and machine and was sorely missing from the latest installment. I feel that the writers made some really lazy decisions here too, destabilising the romantic relationship and bringing back main characters from the dead without really fully committing to any of these plot devices. <br/><br/>I still think the animated movie from 1984 is the best Transformers movie that was been released."

I loved Revenge of the Fallen even more than the first Transformers movie. <br/><br/>I will say that if you go to a movie looking to pick it apart, then of course you wont enjoy it. Take the movie for what it is meant to be, a fun, fantasy flick for children of all ages. Don't read so much into the ""plot holes"" that might exist, just let yourself be taken on the wonderful journey. <br/><br/>While I did think that they focused a bit too much on Megan Fox's body at some points, I didn't feel that it detracted from the overall flow of the movie and didn't let it bother me. <br/><br/>Do I think that half the things in this movie would ever be real? No, but I don't believe that exhibits in a museum can really come to life either yet enjoyed Night at the Museum just as much.

There was a bit of cheesiness in the movie when it went to the whole 'destiny' thing. Another flaw was Megan Fox's acting. Come on! When you're about to die and hyper you don't smile! And last but not least, the story needed a twist.<br/><br/>Now all this is quite minor and doesn't do much damage to the movie as a whole. The cinema was rocking with laughter every now and then and the mind blowing visuals were just plain eye candy. Yum.<br/><br/>My favorite part was the action.

He makes action movies. And he delivers. I don't dislike anything he has directed or produced so far. He makes what the Bay-fans expect of him. And I hope he will continue this way. If you don't like him, don't go see his movies, so you don't have to write such negative comments and the user rating above will look more positive which this movie deserves.

","I had high hopes for this movie, though I hadn't seen the previous Transformers I still though the previews looked good. However I soon realized my mistake. This movie was immature, underdeveloped, and somewhat promoting of racial stereotypes through a robot persona. The parents were retarded. The love story was lacking and overly dramatized. The music was ridiculously dramatic turning everything into a huge ordeal. No character development took place and there were some predictably bad characters as well as some pretty uninspired acting. The two added robots were stereotypical and fairly racist as they were the ones who carried the brunt of the immature humor. The reason I even give this a 3 star rating was that the graphics were immersive and the sound effects too. The reason ONLY three is because of the aforementioned, and because special effects cannot be a selling point for a movie. Sure they're cool to see, but I'd rather not have to deal with awful robot penis jokes (why do they even have a penis? or care of there existence...? but i wander...) and bad characters with generic, over-hyped, and unrealistic personalities.

","Michael Bay, most known for directing action films filled with explosions, and slow-mo scenes of people saying ""no"", brings the unnecessary sequel of Transformers to the theatres in a way that could've been improved upon in many aspects.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox star as Sam Witwicky and Mikeala Banes respectively, who encountered a race of aliens whom take the presence of assorted vehicles while on Earth. The plot basically stays constant throughout the film, metal-men fighting, explosions, followed by colourful and shiny things in an attempt to distract the audience from it's obvious flaws.<br/><br/>The acting was sub-par, basically saying that it is going to be a bit below what you are expecting. Before viewing this film, I wasn't expecting good acting quality, and the film was spot-on with my predictions. Overall, don't expect much.<br/><br/>The script was very dull. Most of the dialogue was filled with an attempt to make either a inspirational speech, or an attempt to make a touching moment between characters. The dialogue was trying too hard to become a film with a very inspiring plot, but didn't come close to it. The plot was very basic, and had no defining part of interest. It seemed pretty straight-forward, and had no changing point to make the audience go in awe/shock. Possibly one of the worst parts was the humour. Usually, mature humour in films is worth a great laugh, but this film goes far and beyond respectable. Some jokes are down-right sad. <br/><br/>The soundtrack was absolutely horrible. I personally believe that if a song is going to be used in a film, it should only be used once. A song loses meaning if it is played multiple times, and sometimes for no reason at all. Whatever happened to orchestral music that usually accompanies fight scenes? That is probably the one feature that connects the film with the audience. It gives it that much more feel, and makes a much better film.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a status-quo Michael Bay film. Not much to expect, and definitely not much to follow."

However, some of the actors in this film just don't fit. Also, some of the scenes in the film just did not fit well in my opinion.

I really can't see what turned some people off so much about this movie. Yes, juvenile jokes abound, and yes, Megan Fox's sexual appeal to the predominantly male audience was certainly exploited to the limits of the film rating, but c'mon, folks. This was a story about giant sentient robots that transform into, well, cars – and beat the crap out of each other in a no-holds-barred slugfest.<br/><br/>It was fun from start to finish! It delivered precisely what you'd expect from such a premise – a exciting, only semi-serious, action-packed flick that fired full throttle on, yes, over-inflated, but no less universally appealing themes of heroism, villainy, and sacrifice – oh, yeah, and giant sentient robots that transform into cars, and beat the crap out of each other in a no-holds-barred slugfest. What else do you want? <br/><br/>Those fuddy-duddies waxing nostalgically over some Shakespearean version of a Transformers that never really was need to revisit what it means to have fun at a movie. If I wanted to see the original Transformers, the animated series, in all its glory, then I'd pop some popcorn, pull out those old VHS tapes, and camp out in front of the TV for a metal-on-metal marathon, complete with '80s commercials. But to expect Bay and the team behind Revenge of the Fallen to blatantly pander to rose-tinted views of the Transformers by creating the same thing all over again is sadly lacking in ambition, creativity, and inspiration.<br/><br/>Seriously, Mr. Bay, you get a double-thumbs up from me for putting the biggest smile on my face after a movie this year. Thank you!"

Now time for the nitpicking... The comedy in the film was good and produced genuine laughs, but there were some moments when i felt it just strayed too far into the comedy genre. Like the dogs humping (seriously)? Also the story was kinda weak, but not too bad (again, it's an action flick... you can't expect shawshank).

I experienced nearly every emotion that i could. If i was not laughing( which i did a lot) then I was on the edge of my seat from action and the emotions during sad scenes were the kind of emotions i have not felt from a movie in some years. The way the action was shot and portrayed i felt like i was amongst the midst and chaos of the battles which i loved and it was a unique way of showing the battles. This was all around another great film for Micheal bay if only he were aloud to recreate all our beloved childhood cartoons into live action movies.

"pyrocitor","3","1","5","3 July 2009"," Garish excesses of empty spectacle - too much and too superficial to even find any fun in
","Rarely can a director's style, credentials and modus operandi be encapsulated simply by their name, but no words can more concisely sum up Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen than ""it's a Michael Bay movie"". Infamous for his deliriously excessive action films, Bay tends to polarise audiences, with them either outrageously entertained or hit with fits of nausea and rage, and his latest robotic slugfest is no exception. Those repulsed by Bay's first Transformers will hardly be won over by its sequel, as Revenge of the Fallen feels less like a new narrative than an overblown retread of the first, with Bay's grandest ambition seemingly to be how much more of everything he can stuff into the template of the first film, as if assuming that more can only mean better. Predictably enough, it doesn't, as Bay's flagrant excesses go beyond guilty pleasure entertainment to simply being too much, capsizing the film through an overwhelming cascade of content, carnage, sound and CGI. <br/><br/>It is clear by the film's most common defense, ""what would you expect from a Michael Bay movie with giant robots"" that it is hardly going to be award winning dramatic material, but when such a defense is repeated ad nauseum with no other redeeming factors stated that the quality is increasingly suspect. Indeed, Bay's film feels less like cinema than being strapped to a roller coaster upside down while being shot at - an all out, chaotic visceral assault on the senses which forgoes coherence past the usual action film lapses to a complete disregard for any sense whatsoever. The word at hand is gratuitous, as if blatantly pandering to the 13 year old boy in everyone (as his comical quantity of 'Megan Fox running in slow motion shots' prove testament to) while bathing in cliché and jettisoning any sort of story cohesion. Laughably underdeveloped characters come and go with no explanation, with far too much time devoted to inane comic relief sidekicks while leads have seemingly little purpose (for all the hype regarding Megatron's resurrection, he does alarmingly little once back, and titular primary villain The Fallen has a similarly elusive role). The plot is reduced to characters screaming or babbling nonsensical exposition, and logic is dropped to the point of there being a twenty minute sequence during the final battle where it is near impossible to gather any sense of what is going on, making for a surreal, alienated feeling rather than giddy enjoyment. <br/><br/>All of which might normally be markers for a triumphant guilty pleasure were it not for the fact that the film is simply too much to even enjoy in a purely superficial way, coming across as maddening to the point of being boring. While Bay is clearly gunning for a movie 'experience', his film is far too long and obscenely self-indulgent, bulging at the seams with numerous sequences (particularly protagonist Sam Witwicky's early college scenes and the climactic battle scenes) needing not a judicious trimming as much as a vicious hacking. Obnoxiously loud and nasty, Bay's film lumbers all over the place too much to enjoy, feeling despite the frantic movement and noise, as if nothing is really happening. All the while, it would seem Bay somewhat loses track of his film's own mythology, offering not so much plot holes as chasms. Similarly, as ironic as it is to complain about such a film having too much complexity, the narrative is simply too frantic with too much going on to possibly follow, making the already nonsensical plot amplify to frenzied levels. Instead of even a shade of a story, Bay offers absurdly juvenile humour, as if sheepishly fishing for laughs to distract from the overwhelming stupidity. Suffice to say, humping dogs, robot testicles and a very out of place thong joke are hardly adequate substitutes for narrative. Even the jaw dropping special effects which propelled the first film feel somewhat stale, with many battles shown in jittery close ups preventing the viewer from fully drinking in the gloriously realised spectacle.<br/><br/>Similarly, while one would be foolish to pursue such fare for the sake of quality acting, the collection of Bay's actors manage to be even worse this time around. Shia LaBeouf substitutes aspiring hip mumbling and whining for charisma as harried protagonist Witwicky, coming across as simply annoying and often utterly irrelevant to the plot. Similarly, Megan Fox is even more overtly reduced to eye candy than previously, with no characterisation apart from leering attempts at being cool or seductive. John Turturro at least operates under fewer delusions of seriousness than the last film, going wildly but amusingly over the top and having a lot more fun with his character. As such, it is up to a screeching Ramon Rodriguez to derail the film even further with an astonishingly irritating and pointless attempt at comic relief, leaving the viewer continually praying he is at least granted a cathartic brutal death by Decepticon. While the return of Peter Cullen sonorous tones and Hugo Weaving's snarls as robotic rivals Optimus Prime and Megatron respectively are a high point, both of their characters are granted insufficient time to punctuate their deathly binary, making the emotional centre of the film feel even more imbalanced. <br/><br/>While any sensible viewer would correctly expect the film to be cheesy, dumb and politically correct in every possible way, what surprises is the film's soulless lack of fun factor, with all components amplified to such garish levels that it transcends into a world of sensations, the viewer utterly overwhelmed by the cacophonous excess of spectacle being thrust in their face. Demented but hardly entertaining, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an entirely vacuous spectacle, rendered nearly redundant by its predecessor, and making it only worth viewing for those desperately craving vastly more of the same. <br/><br/>-3/10"
"dee.reid","10","1","5","3 July 2009"," The movie of the day, er, weekend: ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen""
","Reflecting on ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" much of the movie's imagery remains permanently etched into my memory. I remember the ear-shattering sounds of Autobots and Decepticons going head-to-head in many spectacular battles in Shanghai, later in the American wilderness and some unnamed college university, and finally in the Eyptian desert. I also remember the sounds of metal and machinery reconfiguring itself and the camera being able to catch every mechanical whir and clank. But all that mechanical wonder and glory can be drowned out by a great many explosions and crashes, complements of Hollywood's favorite go-to over-director, Michael Bay, who has also found some kind of guidance in over-direction from the legendary Steven Spielberg, breaking away from his previous long-standing relationship with producer Jerry Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>I also vividly remember the film's plot, where Our Hero Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is attending his first year at college, leaving behind girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) so she can help in her ex-con father's rehabilitation; she is also responsible for being the film's most striking image - the first shot of her, lying on a bike with her posterior high up in the air, is pure eye candy and unforgettable, and an early indication of how she will be used in this picture.<br/><br/>I predict that ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" will win over many hearts and minds over this Fourth of July weekend, and how could it not? It has giant robots fighting to the death, lots of epic special effects transforming sequences, lots of explosions and of course, Megan Fox (by the way, as a guy, I actually think she's one of the LEAST - least is italicized here - attractive young actresses working in Hollywood at the moment).<br/><br/>Bay, that Hollywood hit-maker behind big, explosive epics such as ""The Rock"" (1996) (my personal favorite film of his), ""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) and ""Bad Boys II"" (2003), returns to direct a much bigger, much louder sequel to his 2007 blockbuster hit ""Transformers,"" which saw the big-screen debut of the line of toys made popular by toy company Hasbro in the '80s about massive shape-changing robots of extraterrestrial origin that mistakenly bring their centuries-old war from their home planet Cybertron to Earth, and their luring Everyman Sam Witwicky into the center of their battle.<br/><br/>""Revenge of the Fallen"" concerns the malevolent Decepitcons' - now under the leadership of the newly resurrected Megatron - attempts to locate a mysterious alien power source on Earth so that they can drain all the energy from the sun, or something like that. And for that, they need to locate poor college boy Sam Witwicky. Meanwhile, the heroic Autobots, led by Optimus Prime, have forged a top-secret Autobot/American military alliance to hunt down rogue Decepticons on Earth. And so, we can basically resume the same ""chase movie"" plot between humans and robots from the first film. And somewhere in there, we also learn a little more about the history of the Autobots and Decepticons and their reasons for being on Earth in the first place.<br/><br/>Boy, is this film long. But, at 2 1/2 hours, the film is never really boring, despite getting off to a very slow start. There's a lot to like here, and there's a lot to not like. The good is that the movie looks fantastic, is well-acted (especially Agent Simmons, played by a scene-stealing John Turturro), and well-made; I'm really getting tired of saying that about most big Hollywood blockbusters, because any movie being made nowadays can look fantastic and can be well-made and well-acted and still be complete crap. Truly the second best thing that can be said about ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is that Shia LaBeouf is turning out to be one of the most likable Everymen working in Hollywood nowadays, since he is basically continuing the likable Everyman shtick from the first film. Also, Fox looks pretty good, but that's really all that she does for the movie: she looks pretty good.<br/><br/>The bad is that the movie is just too long, there are too many unnamed robots running amok (Devastator was awesome beyond words and was actually quite scary, but he wasn't in the movie long enough), and a lot of the comic elements really aren't that funny; of course I'm talking about the jive-talking twin Autobots. Much has been made about these two and their (alleged) racist portrayal of blacks, right down to one of them having a gold tooth. As a black male, I didn't find them offensive in the least bit, but I instead found them to be stupid, unnecessary, distracting, and annoying. Above all, they were terribly un-funny.<br/><br/>The best thing that can be said about ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is that while it's not a vastly superior sequel in the least, it's more like the 1980s cartoon series that it inspired it. And that is what will undoubtedly make this movie a winner this Fourth of July weekend.<br/><br/>10/10"
"tormentt-1","1","1","5","2 July 2009"," Is this called the Adventures of Sam Witwicky?
","This movie cheesed me off. Firstly, it's a movie you HAVE to watch.

I couldn't be more relieved when that crock of manure they call a movie ended.<br/><br/>And it's so sad it had to be this way. To see what utter rubbish talentless people can produce with such a great legacy like the Transformers.<br/><br/>If you think a movie about giant robots can't be any good, you haven't seen the cartoons. They were so well written! Each Transformer had distinct personalities - from the wise and patient Optimus, his loyal lieutenant Ultra Magnus, the kind hearted Bumblebee, the maniac Megatron, his conniving Starscream, the faithful Soundwave. Their different characters and voices made them so believable, there was little need to involve actual humans into the story.<br/><br/>Then there were some really cool Transformers like the giant Omega Supreme with his deep booming voice and Fortress Maximus, a whole base that could transform!<br/><br/>There was one story called the Key to Vector Sigma, which I still remember to this day which had so much drama, humour and a thrilling climax between the Autobots & Decepticons! Wow! You don't need big budget, you need creativity, passion and well, you need talent!<br/><br/>Coming back to Transformers 2, all those are lacking. What you get are really, really stupid jokes. I mean, some idiots in the audience laughed, but most were like..WTF?

"Monotreme02","5","1","5","2 July 2009"," Entertaining but dragged down by heavy flaws
","I'll start with the pros: There's no denying it – the movie is irresistibly entertaining. Michael Bay has received much criticism throughout his career, but one thing that must be said is that the man knows how to shoot an action scene. And how to shoot a movie in general – his over-the-top, hyper-stylized style, featuring smooth camera moves, slow motion and lots of sunset photography is among the best and most satisfying in the action genre. The action set pieces featured are wildly entertaining and quite imaginative, and are shot and present exceptionally well, really highlighting and emphasize everything that is purely and totally cool about them. I mean, the film sets out to depict giant robots fighting other giant robots, large-scale action scenes, explosions, destruction and high octane, no-holds-barred action sequences – and it delivers completely on these promises. Many scenes in the film, especially the action-oriented ones, left me sitting with a huge, childish, gleeful grin across my face, and were just as exciting and thrilling and heart-pounding as I could have asked for and then some.<br/><br/>Another element of the film that I really liked was the cast. Another example of a film personality getting perhaps more criticism than I think he deserves is Shia LaBeouf; I praised his performance in the first film a couple of years ago, applauding his irresistible and inherently natural charisma, screen presence and ability to superbly combine great comedic chops with more action-oriented feats and even likening him to a young Tom Hanks in terms of his fast-talking, highly energized, hilariously neurotic performance. Well this time around, LaBeouf matches and even surpasses his performance, augmenting the comedic elements with uproarious results while still managing to perfectly deliver the average-guy-turned-action-hero persona. Megan Fox hits her marks and plays her role as eye candy with expert professionalism, and the supporting cast members including John Turturro, Kevin Dunn and Julie White round out the comedic elements to mostly satisfying and quite funny results – although the movie would definitely have benefited greatly had Jonah Hill accepted the role of LaBeouf's college roommate/sidekick.<br/><br/>And yet, the film is not without its flaws, and this time around, they are plentiful. After it ended, I realized what that familiar sensation I felt throughout the screening was – the film suffers from the same fundamental flaws as another high-profile sequel from a few years back, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. And it's no wonder when one notices that both films were written by similar screen writing duos. My assessment of the flaws of that 2006 release, especially in relation to its immensely entertaining and hugely satisfying predecessor, are effortlessly applicable to this sequel as well. It all starts with an inexplicable urge to multiply almost every conceivable element from the first film, without realizing that quantity is never preferable to quality. Wanting to outdo and improve upon the previous film in a series is an understandable and agreeable aspiration, but scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman must realize that this does not have to be achieved by bombarding audiences with burgeoned elements from the first film. So sure, some of these multiplications are acceptable: more robots, bigger action scenes, and longer runtime are by no means bad for the film in this case. But what suffers most from the ""quantity over quality"" mindset is the plot. Both the first Transformers and to a slightly lesser degree the first Pirates of the Caribbean films benefited from ambitious but relatively straightforward plots, while both sequels suffer from heavily saturated, over-detailed and totally convoluted multiple plot lines that, quite frankly, feel like they were made up as the filmmakers went along. Couple that with some truly dismal lines, some of which derive from the unnecessarily labyrinthine complexity of the plot (such as John Turturro's character exclaiming to himself as he climbs the pyramid, ""That machine will destroy the sun if they turn it on. Not on my watch!"" just because by this point audiences are so lost in the plot that they've forgotten what the machine is even there for and why everyone wants to get to it) and some distractingly glaring geographical and continuity errors (the pyramids at Giza and the palace façade at Petra, Jordan are actually hundreds of miles apart, and not adjacent as presented in the movie) and you get a script that ultimately drags the film very heavily down. And the dues ex machine near the end would drive screenplay gurus to suicide.<br/><br/>The first Transformers movie was extraordinary stupid: and yet, it so completely succeeded in its admitted aspiration to be a purely, completely enjoyable spectacle and entertainment that delivers everything it promises in terms of robot action and fantastic set pieces while never taking itself seriously, that its ridiculous plot and silly, campy elements were easily ignored and perhaps even complemented it. The plot of Revenge of the Fallen is beyond stupid, but the difference is that while in the first film the brainless plot is ignorable, in the sequel it's actually quite distracting. All these elements are easily comparable to the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and similarly, both franchises took something of a fall in their second films. Like Dead Man's Chest, I felt that Revenge of the Fallen suffered from an overly dense and extremely convoluted plot which not only damaged the quality of the film, but more importantly, failed to retain the novelty, the magical sense of wonder and discovery that the first films in these franchises benefited from so wonderfully. So while this sequel was still immensely and unquestionably entertaining, I still feel that much of what made the first film so utterly enjoyable was lost. And considering the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise's track record, I'm not particularly optimistic about the inevitable third Transformers film to come."
"wdmrose","5","1","5","1 July 2009"," More Robots than the First, Less Plot
","I did not grow up with the original Transformers cartoons. My older brother did and I was able to watch the cartoon somewhat when I was little, but it was not enough to make me a huge fan. Enough to make me like it, but that's about it. When I saw the first Transformers, I was impressed. Yes, the robots played second fiddle to the human characters, but the movie had a plot to follow. The humor was there but not in your face and the comic-relief characters were actually funny. Now, the 'fanboys' of the Transformers cartoon had a tendency to hate the movie because there weren't enough Transformers and said they wanted more of them.<br/><br/>Well, they got their wish.<br/><br/>""Revenge of the Fallen"" definitely has more robots than the first one. Where they came from is briefly explained before it is dropped, however, and unless you were a die-hard fan of the cartoon, you wouldn't know who these new characters were because the audience is never completely introduced to them! My brother had to tell me the names of most of them. Not only are they not introduced, but, except for a handful of them, they only get a short time on screen. The Autobots from the first film, except for Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, only appear briefly, if at all. The new Autobot Twins fall short of doing their job. I'm sure they were meant for the kids and for comic-relief, but they were just annoying, even to me and I have a high tolerance for annoying characters (I actually did not mind Jar Jar in Star Wars, to give you an idea.) They served no purpose to the plot whatsoever. They were fine when they were introduced in the beginning fight, but they never left. They just tagged along with the protagonists and were pretty much ignored by everyone. Wheelie, a small Decepticon with a smart ass attitude, wasn't really annoying, especially compared to the Twins. He would have been good for comic-relief and he actually has a role in the film. Not a large one, but he does do something for the plot.<br/><br/>Speaking of plot, this movie has a poor excuse for one. It's there, but it's difficult to follow. The first thirty to forty-five minutes or so was decent. It was a nice setup and connected well to the first film. But once the conflict was introduced, everything became chaotic. The romance is not engaging at all as any issue Sam and Mikaela have to deal with is solved within a scene or two. Issues and characters are dropped with no explanation as soon as they have no importance to the plot anymore, while characters like Leo stay in the entire movie yet contributes nothing to the film. The plot builds up sloppily and the ending is anti-climatic. They obviously wanted to wrap up the plot completely at the end and they are obviously setting up for a sequel. The anti-climatic ending could've been fixed, I feel, if Micheal Bay would have left some plot points, what few there were, open to conclude in the next film, similar to ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."" It wouldn't have save the messy and weak plot, but it might have made the ending less of a disappointment.<br/><br/>One thing that bothered me more than the lack of plot was the excessive amount of swearing and sexual humor. If the first film would've been similar, this wouldn't bother me. But because the first film had only a handful of scenes dealing with swearing and sexual humor, it comes off as very immature in this film. No, this is not a kids film, but considering its popularity with children, you'd think Micheal Bay would've toned such things down, not jack it up. It adds a very tacky dimension to the film.<br/><br/>There are a few redeeming qualities. Visually the film is wonderful. The robots are just as impressive as the first film and the fight scenes are just as epic. The music was good. Those who wished for more robots than humans got it. There are many nods to the cartoons which fans will appreciate. The acting isn't horrible, in fact it's pretty good, even though the characters are flat.<br/><br/>Overall, this is what I expected the first film to be like. I'm sure many people did and when we all saw the first film, we were blown away at how surprisingly complex it was for a film based on toys and an 80s cartoon. This film, however, is no where near that impressive. Is it worth seeing? Sure, especially if you're a Transformers fan, but don't waste your time and money to go to a theater to see it. Wait for it to come out on DVD and buy it then or rent it. It's nothing amazing, but it's not the worst movie out there. It's a good movie to watch on a rainy day, but not one to see over and over."

","I've used to watch the original animated 80's Transformers and came to forgive the first 21st century adaptation on the big screen; maybe because I covertly missed the oh-so-commanding voice of Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>But after watching this on some cinema so elaborately sound set-up, I did get the pleasure that I was half-after for: the computer-generated effects pummeling my auditory senses to submission. I believe that's about it. In a way, those shards of ""un-obtanium"" metallic figures brawling themselves to pieces leaves big to the imagination (and confusion): Who is that battling whom? Who the heck is winning? Why, oh why, with all that technological advancement and ""alien"" heritage some come to have such ""saintly and humanly"" conscience?<br/><br/>Stereotypicism was aplenty: a pair that act like some Wayan brothers comedy, a scantily-clad and suggestively-positioned (more often than not) eye candy, an education-oriented fellow who suddenly flips and decided he wants to be the next Indiana Jones, etc.<br/><br/>All is not lost though. This was some of the best Cheetos I've consumed in months. I've never imagined Megan Fox more properly exposed, Shia LaBeouf less clueless than ""Disturbia"", and John Turturro less convincing than ""Brain Donors"".<br/><br/>It's good, when you weigh the good from the bad. Hey, I wouldn't spend millions on effects just to fill a movie minute; I'd simply want it to be an indispensable minute of the movie. Though, since watching ""Idiocracy"", I couldn't help myself to be somehow disturbed.<br/><br/>Go watch it on some bass-booming, wide-screened, and audio surrounded with some good 'ol younger company; just like your mother warned you about some fellow: It is and will be, a good mess."

It's always easy to say a movie is very good because it's not as bad as I expected, but this certainly wasn't a very good movie.<br/><br/>First of all the dialogue didn't suck near as bad in the first installment (thank God Anthony Anderson was not asked to come back) Next I actually did laugh a few times, only once though I think it was intended. Great visuals, decent story, some good performances.<br/><br/>Now the bad. I think most will agree this was WAAAAAAY too long. This would have been a much more effective film if at least 45 minutes was left on the cutting room floor. There were a lot of scenes that served zero purpose for the plot of the story. In fact most of the first 30 minutes could have been shot in one or two short scenes.<br/><br/>Overall: I think 5/10 is about right leaning more toward less than half. This is definitely a case where less would have been more as far as quality.

","I had to bump my vote up to a 5 because for everything that is wrong with this movie (and oh, is there a LOT wrong), it does provide some good action scenes and Shia actually does a little bit of good acting (there's a shocker M. Night Shyamalan wouldn't have dreamed up). Everyone has already gone on ad nauseum about the twins, and justifiably so. I can't believe anyone tries to defend their presence in this movie. Along with the obnoxious roommate, they contribute virtually nothing except line after line of offensive dialogue. The second girl is brought in purely to put more sex in the movie. She could have-and SHOULD have-been cut out of the movie completely. The action sequences were good for the most part, but so chaotic you had no idea what was going on most of the time. I had the same issue with the first movie. Pretty much everything, in fact, that was wrong with the first movie was simply amplified and expanded in this one. The worst thing about this movie is that it is marketed straight at kids and it couldn't be less appropriate. And don't give me that ""It's PG-13, you should know better"" bull. When they are running ads on Disney and Nick and selling toys at Burger King, who do you think they are trying to get into the theater? AND the movie was way too long! If they had cut out all the vulgarity, most of the sex and at least some of the over-the-top violence it would have been the perfect running time and a much better movie. The true shame is that it is already one of the biggest hits in movie history and will only make more money."

This is because there were frequent childish jokes throughout the movie, as well as adult humor that would not be appropriate for young kids. Now how can you provide a movie that is not appropriate for both kinds of viewers?<br/><br/>That is all I have to say."

","I'm from the generation of the fortunate who watched the Transformers cartoons when in kids (mid 80's). The joy and wonder transmitted by these cartoons was unparalleled.<br/><br/>When I knew Steven Spielberg was producing a Transformers movie I was excited. The Transfomers I movie was a success. It was fun, refreshing, the story was good. Good job! And thank you Steven for another jewel.<br/><br/>I saw the Transformers 2 movie this weekend. I got bored at half of it (~2:30h long). Let me say in its defense that the special effects are impressive and of an incredible magnitude that makes your skin hair raise. In one word: electrifying.<br/><br/>At some point the movie looses its interest. The dialogs become cheesy, the battles take too long or are too confusing. There are serious editing problems and way too many things happening. The story although interesting is not told in the right timing nor in the right way. The jokes are poor and are targeted mostly for young people (<16) Bottom line and Warning: Since the target audience for this movie seems to be the hip-hop generation, people of ages late 20's or 30's will have serious issues with this movie. If you can overcome that, you like special effects and you're big fan of the transformers I guess its still worth while spending 10 bucks to take your friend to the movie for a ride, although you'll be a bit tired in the end."

","Yes even with all the heap about this movie I do agree with this score 6.0/10 Come one the movie was good but to me I think the movie is more about selling the action figures than actually entertain us thats what I think. The plot took long and Though I said that to my brothers, they replied ""The Dark Knight was that long."" But I think that The Dark Knight is a way better movie that this Transformers, I just think towards the middle of the movie it was elongated (hope i spelled it right) and it went to no where. It seriously did! I got mad at the length it took to give the audience nothing. Not only that but all the kids that went to go see that movie would laugh at every cuss word they would say and only knew one character through out the whole movie, Optimus Prime it was funny in that part when he dies and all the kids in the theater where so close to crying, that was the funniest part for me, its not really the movie but the response given by the 7 year old audience that don't understand the movie.

"Fenris Fil","3","1","5","30 June 2009"," What could have been a good film ruined by Bay's totally incompetence .
","I was totally addicted to Transformers as a kid and I really wanted to like this, but instead the film just upset me at how wrong so much of it was. If only this was directed by someone with actual talent it could have been the most awesome blockbuster ever. But Michael Bay is frankly an incompetent hack with virtually no respect for his own source material.<br/><br/>Of the many things wrong: * The film was still dominated by the human sub-stories and excessive comedy relief moments that mostly fell flat. The one comedy moment that actually made me giggle involved the ""Wheelie"" character, which I won't ruin by giving detail on. Almost all of the comedy was juvenile (including the bit I found funny).<br/><br/>* Bay constantly spins the camera round and round during ""dramatic"" talking scenes. That stuff is what people that don't know how to build tension do to fill in for their lack of actual skill. It just makes me dizzy and want to vomit.<br/><br/>* The Power balance seemed all wrong in this movie. The deceptions pretty much seem to be complete pussies and the big scary ""ohhhhhh how can we beat him"" Megatron from the previous film has been replaced by a wimpy lackey Megatron that needs help to fight Optimum Prime (who he soundly pummelled in the first film). Even the weaker autobots seemed to be kicking butt while the decepticons seemed to drop like flies.<br/><br/>* The focus for both Autobots and Decepticons seemed to be mostly on the comedy relief bots. Megatron and Starscream had some good moments between them and Optimus was cool as always, but it seemed the other decent characters were pushed so far into the background they were just miscellaneous background fodder. I really don't care that much for a non-talking Bumblebee (that's Wreck-Gar's gimmick anyway) and the ghetto twins (who seemed like superimposed cartoons half the time). Plus there just seemed to be way too many of them to really do any justice (especially the decepticons).<br/><br/>* I really didn't have a frigging clue what was going on at the end with the action. I'm sure I saw the same deception die about 25 times. Most of them look and sound so similar and the action was so all over the place (and of course not really focused on the robots) that I just found myself baffled as to who was fighting who half the time.<br/><br/>* The whole idea of using the Fallen just overshadowed the rest of the decepticons, especially Megatron. I remember in the animated Transformers movie, Megatron/Galvatron always planned to betray Unicron. He answers to no one, at least not willingly. If that version treated the enormous planet eater like that, I find it hard to accept the movie version so willingly serving the Fallen. Not the the Fallen is actually used much as a character, he just seems to be there to make the rest of the deceptions look like Tools.<br/><br/>On the positive side I like the use of Soundwave and Starscream in this and the way they worked Jetfire into it. Overall there was a good film in there but there was a couple of really bad ones mixed up with it. A few bits I enjoyed, a few bits puzzled me, a few bits made me want to cry they were so wrong, but most of it I just found boring."
"bladou","Null","1","5","30 June 2009"," Erm
","Lets be fair, summer blockbusters are meant for one thing only : watch stuff explode or have a sci-fi action flick.<br/><br/>And actually its usually fun as long as it looks good but this one is just plain shockingly eratic at best. Basically its the same as the previous movie with a few profanities randomly thrown in along fast - like eyes bleeding fast - paced action.<br/><br/>Now, I like kitch but giants robots in the woods reminds me of a godzilla-type film made by bored billionaires... seriously ? Thing is I could have watched that kind of stuff in an anime 24 episodes long with a real work on the story instead a 2hrs mindless showdown, ID4 was pretty much the same but still there was people in it (I'd add lexomil acting but that's just me). In ROTF, characters are either robots or just a background to make you wait until the next bots fight. You've got a story going on but given the context, its worse than no story at all; it feels like being added from deleted scenes.<br/><br/>I love being entertained whatever kind of flick it is; that movie just looks too random for me but at some point choosing between full CGI or enhanced by CGI movies is a wise idea. <br/><br/>Still, kudos to the director for the best laugh I had during a ""lord of the ring-matrix-stargate"" story climax, having so heterogeneous plots in a single sequence is really impressive and needs to be noted. Though its not ""Weng Weng"" funny just yet.<br/><br/>Lastly, acting ... well no one expected good performance so at least, I've got what I though I'd have. Could have been worse I guess - with some rehearsal though."

","Before I point out the shortcomings of this film, I'll explain why I'm giving the film three stars out of ten. I'm giving these stars for the CGI and explosions - that's it. With that aside, every aspect of the movie is awful.<br/><br/><ul><li>Humor: If I wanted to be entertained with humping animals, cheap sex jokes, and racial stereotypes I would have gone to a comedy film. I'm not offended by crude humor, but it doesn't belong in the beloved Transformers franchise. Campy jokes delivered by some of the auto bots (relating to machinery and metal) while stupid, were funnier than most of the sex jokes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Drama: I felt no sense of dread when watching the Decepticons; if anything, it was just exciting to watch them kill everyone in their path. Shouldn't the audience feel intimidated by villains in films? When Optimus Prime was killed in the first hour you could already sense the forthcoming cliché of resurrection and retribution that would occur too quickly in the last ten minutes. How pathetic. As far as humans, you couldn't care less about any of them. I was hoping we'd see more from Tyrese Gibson and Josh Duhamel; instead, I was treated to Ramon Rodriguez - the annoying ""Leo Spitz"". I'm not even going to go into detail about the shallowness of the ""love"" between our two main protagonists. Whenever they delivered the line, ""I love you"", I couldn't help but roll my eyes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Plot: see the hundreds of other reviews. I won't point out the plot holes and weaknesses; they've already been discussed over and over. I'll just agree that the plot was boring and weak. Robot heaven, really? I actually gave the first Transformers (2007) eight stars out of ten. The story, despite its clichés, was actually entertaining. I was able to distinguish the transformers. The sequel recycled the same ""find the boy because he has the ____ "" formula but fell on its face.</li></ul><br/><br/>I won't even discuss the racial stereotypes of Skids and Mudflap. The producers could have easily left out the ""thug"" archetype and made them more interesting and less annoying."

","Terminator Salvation is without doubt one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life - an incoherent, stupid stupid stupid film, made by stupid people for stupid people. After reading some of the extremely negative reviews on this site for Transformers ROTF, I was expecting it to be just as bad. Fortunately, it wasn't. Now, don't get me wrong, Transformers ROTF is not a good movie by any means. The humor in it is puerile (lots of dogs humping, robots with giant metal testicles, mums on drugs etc.), the plot is barely present, the young female characters mostly look like porn stars, and it does veer towards right-wing propaganda at one point, but at least the story is coherent ... no ""WTF, that makes absolutely no sense!!! was this script written by a special-needs child on acid?!?!?"" moments, as with T5."
"dobbin-4","6","1","5","29 June 2009"," Not as good as the first one but is better then most Hollywood dribble
","I remember not expecting anything good when I walked into the first Transformers movie since I had not liked the animated series, I was not a big fan of Micheal Bay's (Judging from Pearl Harbour and Armarrgedon being terrible) but, since there was nothing else good I went anyway and I was surprised, since it had good special effects (Well I saw THAT coming) and actually had a storyline and I was impressed, it was definitely a step up movie wise for Hollywood/Micheal Bay.<br/><br/>Then when I heard about the second movie and I think with my high expectations I was pretty much down there. I expected the same fantastic quality of the first one and while this movie is good, it does not ever reach the quality the first one did.<br/><br/>In this one Sam goes off to college 2 years after his first battle with the decepticons. But adventure follows him there and he is led into the second major battle of good vs. evil.<br/><br/>The story is alright although lacking in some places, the movie does use its long run time well though and never stops unless it has to. Although the special effects take up this one more, this was not the only problem. They added too many of the characters just for kid humour, something which was lacking in the first one (which is a good thing) and I hated the twins that talked give even though that has not been considered a cool thing to have in a movie in about 5-10 years.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie fails to reach up to the standards of the first movie but is pretty good and well worth a watch for fans of the first movie and the show. I rate it 62% for being an entertaining popcorn movie. Nothing more."
"katran1","9","1","5","29 June 2009"," Not bad. Not great, but not bad.
","I enjoyed this film, though not quite as much as the first. The blue-screening was weak, as was much of the humor. I was also very disappointed at the foul language and repeated sexual references. The first movie was much milder in that respect, so based on that I took my 10-year-old daughter to see this one. If I'd known about all the genital references and use of the 5-letter p-word, I'd have left her home. This one definitely earned it's PG-13 rating on the language alone.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I enjoyed the storyline, action and characters, for the most part. I found the comic-relief twin vehicles to be very annoying. Their humor was just bad and way overdone. It was as if the writers were trying too hard to be funny in this one. They need to tone it down and make it more subtle. I was just waiting for someone to throw a pie.<br/><br/>Am I sorry I spent money to see this movie in the theater? No. The action alone made it worth the money. The Autobot characters, especially Prime and Bumblebee were enjoyable as always. Shia LaBeouf did a good job again as Sam, and his character seemed more mature this time around. Unfortunately, the character of Mikaela was even sluttier than the first go-around, and didn't seem to be as strong or intelligent as in the first film. At least she had an active role in the first movie. In this one she seemed to be nothing but eye-candy for the most part.<br/><br/>So, in a nutshell, not as good as the first film, but still good enough to spend money on, imho. I'll definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD."
"Indydan13","6","1","5","29 June 2009"," Stupid, Poorly Made and Lame...But Fun
","When reviewing a movie like this, one should consider not even bothering. A film with a laughable plot, often horrid dialog, lame jokes, and that tool Shia LeBeouf should be ripped apart a la ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"". However, this does what that joke couldn't do...it entertained.<br/><br/>Let's begin by getting the obvious out of the way. The acting (at least the live action and some of the voice over) was reminiscent of an Elementary School production. The storyline was full of clichés and plot holes and meaningless subplots. Some Autobots were barely mentioned or seen and other characters that were prominently featured just seemed to disappear. The acting direction was a joke and those twins reminded me of Amos and Andy (if you get the reference, kudos).<br/><br/>That being said, when one goes in to see a movie about giant robots fighting, you can't go in expecting something worthy of the IMDb 250. Many have insulted the defenders of this film by saying that they are ""mindless"" and ""tasteless"" and should know what a good movie is. Sure, this movie was all those, but it was good escapism. I wanted to see epic fight scenes and good explosions, because that's all I trust Bay to do. What movie of his has had ""good"" film-making involved? It's going to be bad, but it's going to be fun. If you want a thought provoking message film, you should stay away. If you want a fun, but stupid, ride, go for it. Try to enjoy a few hours of stupidity and stop over thinking things.<br/><br/>Besides, the trailer for ""New Moon"" was more cringe worthy than this whole movie, so it could be worse."

But when I saw the first film in 2007, I was not disappointed. And I just saw the second one. And was it good or bad? Well a little of both actually.<br/><br/>It's two years later, and Optimisprime and some new Autobots are working for the government, to help defeat new diseptacons from invading earth.

Has Sam begins to settle in college life. An enemy called the fallen wants Sam for some reasons. Will Prime and Bots stop the Fallen before it's too late?<br/><br/>The good thing about this movie is the action and the effects, thy are just jaw dropping with excitement. You'll feel like it's in high definition if you sit close enough. Now what was bad, the overdone humor. I mean the first one had humor, but it knew not to overdo it. The writers must have forgot that kids at the age of 12 are gonna want to see this, cause they have more adult humor this time. And they also went to great lengths to make Megan Fox the eye candy through out the whole movie, I mean come on it is clear that she is a beautiful sexy woman, you didn't half to keep reminding us of that.<br/><br/>This movie is not for any kids under 13.

","I'm honestly tired of reading those abusive reviews by ""wanna be"" critics who seems have walked into a screening of Transformers 2 completely by accident confusing it with a play by Shakespeare.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the movie delivered exactly what it was supposed to deliver, and that folks is entertainment. The scenes are NOT dull and repetitive, the camera is NOT shaking without a stop, and the actors are NOT horrible, and by the way, to all the Megan Fox critics, I'm sorry, but how exactly do you come to the conclusion that she's a bad actor? Even if she was one, you can't possibly reach this conclusion from the 1 - 2 liners she was delivering. Therefore, please go back to your day jobs and leave the criticism to people who are paid to do it.<br/><br/>The movie delivers itself well enough, there are no plot holes left and that is something you do not usually expect from an action film. The jokes are funny enough, for most of the people in the screening to laugh, and that I suppose should mean something. Which only makes me wonder even more, if those few people who didn't like the jokes or the ""gangsta"" stereotype are commenting here. The film is after all aimed mainly at teenagers and Transformers fan, and each of the target audiences is catered.<br/><br/>Michael Bay didn't just deliver awesome action sequences but also managed to portray Optimus Prime perfectly in my opinion - selfless, honorable, chivalrous and one hell of a bad ass. The action sequences with him were exactly what I would expect from a leader of Autobots.<br/><br/>Of course the film is not perfect, it's a tad too long, I would've loved to see more screen time and lines added to the Autobots, because after all the movie is about them and not only about the love story between Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox.<br/><br/>I suggest to go see this movie, because it DOES deliver what it's tasked with and that is entertainment and a lot of robot action."

"rn189307","5","1","5","29 June 2009"," A Michael Bay Compilation
","First let me start by saying that I like Michael Bay. I don't listen to the haters who long for a cult classic every time they go to the theaters and are most likely just jealous that Bay has the coolest job in the world; he gets to blow lots of stuff up and make millions of dollars for it.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of Transformers, and I feel that Revenge of the Fallen did a good job of keeping pace with the first. This time it's bigger, louder and much more boggling to all of your senses. The Action scenes feature bigger robots and bigger expanses of land to comprise the settings, such as the entire Egyptian desert. The plot does suffer from noticeable (HUGE actually) flaws such as Sam and his entourage enter the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum (Which is in Washington DC for those who don't know, Michael Bay being obviously doesn't) and then run out the back door only to find themselves in some sort of airplane graveyard desert . Oops.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I found myself constantly laughing out loud at the repetitive use of shots and sequences that were blatantly copy and pasted from basically every other Michael Bay film. The low angled shot of a slow motion jumbo jet passing overhead is ripped straight out of the first Bad Boys. Then we move to a scene where a series of marines barge into an underground vault where an alarm has been tripped, but for some reason this scene looked very familiar. Maybe it was because I had already seen it in the opening scene of The Rock. Then there is Armageddon. Oh man, where do I begin? Lets see, we have an exact replica of the shot from outer space where an asteroid (in this case an alien) is traveling directly into our atmosphere. And then there's the sequence where the asteroids (aliens) are tearing apart Paris as they fall from the sky. Bay should have saved himself some money and just edited in the scenes where Asteroids beat down on New York City because they looked the same to me. Going down the list we come to Pearl Harbor. As more alien asteroids fall to earth, a few conveniently plunge through an aircraft carrier just so Bay could have a slow motion underwater shot of the boat sinking. From Bad Boys 2 we have the scene where the camera continuously moves 360 degrees through a crack house, passing through little holes and openings in the wall with Will and Martin on one side and some Haitian druggies on the other. This time it's Shai and Megan on one side of an Egyptian shack and killer robots on the other side. <br/><br/>And of course every Bay movie has that one low angled, slow motion, 360 shot of the main character, that is quickly becoming a trademark of all his movies. However, this movie has just about as many 360 slow-mo shots as Michael Bay has movies. Even the killing of alien robots has become overly extreme and in some cases graphic. This is no doubt a tribute to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday the 13th, which are both produced by Bay.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is an enjoyable summer blockbuster thrill ride. The action keeps the pace moving, the comedic punch lines offer some flavorful color and lets just be honest, Megan Fox is smokin' hot! It's still a Bay film so don't go expecting Oscar gold. This movie is a series of big budget explosions strung together with tidbits of story line but worth seeing."

","Okay, so I know there are a lot of haters out there for this movie. I also know that the critics trashed it.<br/><br/>But I don't listen to critics. And I don't pay any attention to the haters either. So here's my review.<br/><br/>Like I said in the subject, Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen is just as good as the first one. So if you liked the first Transformers movie, you'll like the second. If you didn't like the first one, well then you probably won't like the second one. It's that simple.<br/><br/>It's just a great feel good movie. No, there's nothing overly profound about it, but who cares? Some movies are made to be FUN, and entertaining. This certainly was fun and entertaining. The writing is amazing as far as incredibly funny lines go. The effects are top-notch, the acting is great (how can you fault Shia LaBeouf's acting??? I don't get that one), the music is great, the directing is great, and the plot is pretty darn good too. It's just a great movie. You leave the theater feeling zinged and happy, and that's what entertainment is all about.<br/><br/>So I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. In fact, I saw it twice during its 5-day opening period. I loved it. Actually, I thought that the sequel might have just managed to go a little bit above the original. It would be a touch call though, to decide which one was better. But Revenge Of The Fallen is at least as good as the first one."

Lars Von Trier's ""Antichrist"" was next door people be more careful next time. Yes the humour is not Monty Pythons and Megan Fox's ""assets"" probably act better than her. That is the point. This is an adaptation of a children's animated series. Not even a comic. It is an ""action"" film and it does exactly what it says on the tin. It is action-packed, it is funny in a goofy-adolescent sort of way, it has stunning CGI, the best ever made IMHO. Is it overly long? Probably yes. Does the ACTION become flat at some points? Yes it does. Do I mind? No I don't. And if you can tell your left from your right you shouldn't mind either. The movie delivers on its promises. As long as you know what it has promised. If you don't there is always Lars Von Trier..."
"lambiepie-2","4","1","5","28 June 2009"," Going' with the crowd here...
","Dreamworks and Paramount should congratulate themselves on putting out this wonderful summer fare. It got us to do what was intended, go see a movie with lots of action and neat special effects. Unfortunately, no one said it had to be good.<br/><br/>I'm sure every other review write how wonderful the ""first"" Transformers was. It was. Even the trailers were exciting. This one seemed to have all the elements but missed the mark completely. It was like watching a bunch of scenes thrown together to make a film look like a beloved toy franchise.<br/><br/>Another thing is I saw how little boys, seven to ten, were just lovin' this film while everyone else was looking at them as though they were nuts. They were not because this film, was totally designed for them: no story, lots of ""cool"" colorful robots on the screen. Except for the language. When I was 7 to ten, I don't think my parents would have like me hearing all the swear words that Dreamworks, Paramount, the Ratings board, etc. allowed in...and parents not quite getting what PG 13 ACTUALLY means. Was it because of the robots that were 'mouthing' them, that it was acceptable to these folks? If so, for shame. Of course 7 to 10 year old boys (and some older ones too) aren't going to get the implications of this, but many of the older people did and I must say that was TOTALLY uncalled for in a film franchise like this. It wasn't cute.<br/><br/>Then there are the humans. Sorry, didn't care for the leads, and if you took every single one of them out...they would not have been missed. Only the Armies. The Armies made perfect sense, they should have stuck with them. Actually, it would have made a better story just with the Transformers and the armies. And I was upset that they introduced...ever so slightly...the Pretenders. Or were they the Pretenders, honestly I don't think the filmmakers were too keen on how to develop them. Ori and Bay were more concerned with making MAXIM cover shoots come to life, they missed a golden opportunity here.<br/><br/>And yes, I am SO disappointed at the beginning...Sideways(?) didn't get enough time for me, as did not Devastator at the end. I know about the Constructors, but gee wiz, they just appeared on the screen, all willy nilly and all we had for most of this was visual effects. No story. Opportunity missed.<br/><br/>I am so exhausted over this Transformers 2 hodgepodge, that I fully expect Spielberg to want to introduce the Dinobots in Transformers 3. Not a bad idea, just get another writer and director on it because I know it's itching under his thumb right now.<br/><br/>So should you go out and see it? It's entertainment, but not the best of the 09 summer. It's mindless, and that's good. In IMAX it's fantastic, but don't expect academy award winning material her except for below the line - and that's the point. Got a few bucks to spare - watch. If not, please don't. And if you're waiting for the DVD, I know many parents WILL be disappointed over the unnecessary use of ribald language here.<br/><br/>Dreamworks, Paramount, et al can pop open the champaign for a huge money making opening week and rightfully so, they got us to go out and take a look. Too bad, everything that is supposed to be success is based on how much money it made, because some of the better movies so far, didn't make a lot of money, but deserve a look too. <br/><br/>And..two and a half hours was incredibly TOO long for this, even in IMAX.<br/><br/>So I'll sit and anxiously wait for Transformers 3 - only because I know its comin'...but just a curiosity....hey is um...JJ Abrams and David Knoepp doin' anything....special....'bout now....???"
"s_rade02","2","1","5","26 June 2009"," Could have been sooo much better
","This movie sucked. I really liked the first movie, although it had its flaws, like shaky camera and that a lot of the robots looked too much alike. Some of the humor was bad, the transformers themselves had to little character.<br/><br/>And what happened in part 2? All those things just got waaaaaay worse. And I mean REALLY worse. Instead of writing a wall of text I'll just give some examples. (Here be spoilers) 1. A decepticon transforms into a human woman, yeah right. Terminatrix inc.<br/><br/>2. A little tamagotchi decepticon switches sides because Megan Fox smiles at it, and later humps Michaelas leg. (Nope, not making this up) 3. As much plot holes as Star Trek 10 (If this doesn't bother you, my review won't mean much to you, and no, I'm not exaggerating).<br/><br/>4. Every good character that dies is later resurrected.<br/><br/>5. Action sequences show too much random explosions and slow-motion shots of people /stuff flying around, instead of tense real time fighting between cool DIFFERENT LOOKING bad-ass robots. If you want a good example of a nice fight scene I like, take the one between Leonardo and Raphael from the latest TMNT movie. I didn't like the movie too much, but that scene was awesome. The action in this movie is nothing like it, the camera is way too shaky, too close, you never(OK most of the time anyway) know what's happening to whom.<br/><br/>6. Badass Devastator decepticon can't kill two very very small autobots, is too clumsy / big to reach the top of the pyramid, gets one-shotted by a gunship (which could just as easily destroy the pyramid as well, thus saving the sun from exploding. But that would make the fight shorter, and Michael Bay loves explosions) 7. If all that has not convinced you not to see the movie, maybe the two stereotyped annoying Jar Jar Binks robots with more screen time than Optimus will, although even that might not be enough for you, if you still consider watching it (which scares me). Seriously who the hell had the idea to introduce not one, but TWO Jar Jar Binks aka Franchise Killers into the movie? 8. The humor is terrible. So much characters and scenes are ridiculed by bad sex jokes.<br/><br/>9. This movie is a face-palm flatrate."
"blazephantomzero","5","1","5","25 June 2009"," A Movie driven by good old hype, but doomed as a sequel
","What a surprise Micheal Bay still cannot direct a movie; actually it is not a surprise. The man knows how to makes things explode, but his direction of the transformers movies has gotten worse. The inclusion of the two punk gansta flavored Transformers have lame and terrible humour, which actually goes perfectly with the rest of the films terrible sense of humour. It is also a bad joke that classics like Ironhide get no screen time as compared to those hick gangsters. Micheal Bay also loses points for the treatment of battles. The decipticons are made to be cooler, but it is impossible to believe that one autobot dies as compared to 50 decepticons. It is complete and utter trash with the fault falling on the dirrector and writers, but the other thing is enough with Meghan Fox and Shia Lebeouf; they have served their purpose and Im tired of every Spielberg film needing that un-talented actor. Transformers will do regardless, but it shou;d not because the people in charge of the film did nothing to benefit the transformers legacy, and to Micheal Bay I say how disappointed that you think you are all that killing off Arcee just cause you did not like her. Total Garbage only because of the fault of the people directing.<br/><br/>Honestly I'm a huge transformers fan, but I could not sit back and just enjoy this film, which is sad. The movie passes with its massive improvements after the first terrible battles, but thats it. No doubt most teens will find it humorous, but that as Galvatron would say is ""Bad Comedy"""

","As a kid, I was a loyal Transformers fan. I never thought I would see the day when they were brought to live in such a realistic manner as the first film. So naturally, I couldn't wait to see more Transformers from my childhood come to life in this sequel. Quite frankly, the plot was painfully thin, the action scenes, while exciting were waaay too difficult to follow. Virtually none of the new characters were developed beyond mentioning their names. And lastly, Soundwave. The iconic bad guy that most hardcore fans unanimously wanted to see make an appearance. I thought making him a satellite was a great adaptation, but the voice. C'mon man, it was the only thing that made him cool in the cartoon.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Transformers will make box office records, rewarding Hollywood for spoon feeding the masses with more dribble. It's a shame, because the money invested in this film could have gone a lot further. Instead, in order to build off the success of the first film and ramrod a new film into theaters ASAP, the screenplay appears to have been written in the cab ride to the first day of shooting."
"laserbradley23","6","1","5","28 June 2009"," Trying a little too hard?
","This movie isn't the worst but not the best either. It's possible that the massive success of the first transformers film caused problems for this one.

The first seemed to focus more on Sam (Shia) and he did an excellent job acting....this time we got tons of action action action and the actors didn't really get to act but simply run around while robots fight. It was worth seeing as a transformer fan but I will tell the producers/Michael bay that you don't have to try so hard....<br/><br/>*we don't expect to see fart/hump/sex jokes --- your movie doesn't need it.<br/><br/>*Why put in an aging robot with a cane? ----you movie doesn't need it !<br/><br/>*Stop showing Megan Fox in sexy stances that people just don't stand in ! your movie doesn't need it...

","Look, they pushed this out to capitalize on the success of the first movie and it shows in the script and story (if you can call it that).<br/><br/>It's not that the plot is incomprehensible, it's just that it doesn't mean anything or amount to anything. Anybody looking for more mythology into cybertron, origins of Autobots or decepticons will be sorely disappointed. Then again, anybody with half a brain can figure out that Michael Bay has never been, nor ever will be interested in aspects of film-making that actually add depth to a story. The movie is 2+ hours of explosions, gunfire, and violence interspersed with pitiful attempts at humor.<br/><br/>That being said, the special f/x in this movie are without question some of the best I have ever seen, the pyrotechnics, the CGI, the choreographed battle sequences are first rate, the movie delivers the punch in that department.

","I don't know why so many people are being so cynical about this movie. It's Transformers! How can a person go into this movie and expect to see Citizen Kane or Casablanca? Yes, the acting is not the best. Yes the story has some ""plot holes."" But, they are transforming robots from another planet. I believe that in itself is a plot hole. The CGI is pretty cool. I think it may have been better than first Transformers. The action is fun to watch, and I thought there was just enough story to keep you at least interested in what was going to happen next.

","First off, I'm giving this a 7 because I'm a big fan of Transformers, so I'm predisposed to being a bit more biased in favor of the movie. If I examined this movie like a critic or a film-student (you know who you are), I guess I'd be inclined to knock off a couple of points.<br/><br/>That aside, I found the movie to be enjoyable. I have several problems with the movie (i.e. lack of story and general poor direction), but that did not take away from how fun it was to watch. Sure the humor was sophomoric, and the acting a bit labored, but how is it much different than most (if not summer movies)? Don't use the example of Dark Knight or Ironman, those movies involved ""real"" people. Can anyone make a movie about super-giant robots and hope for the depth that movies concerning human beings could? I seriously doubt it.<br/><br/>Not every movie is meant for us to re-examine ourselves and figure out why our lives suck or is without meaning, sometimes we go watch a movie to have fun, watch stuff blow up, see a hot chick, laugh at dumb jokes, etc.<br/><br/>For all of you who are ""above it,"" (i.e. every film student and twenty-something college dweeb who thinks mainstream = evil - thankfully most of us grow out of that at some point) need to get over yourselves and stop taking everything so seriously."
"aqos-1","7","1","5","28 June 2009"," So-So
","This movie was good, but it could have been better. My biggest complaint was that the battle to get to Optimus took forever. There was too much fighting going on for way too long. I also did not like the moron that they turned Sam's mother into or the way that they over-sexed Megan Fox's character. The new autobots and decipticons were impressive. All of the hype about the twins is not a stereotype that white people put on blacks, but a portrayal of what many blacks have made as a recognizable as a rapper stereotype. They were comical characters. As usual, Bumblebee was great. His emotions were endearing. The scenes with the dogs were not needed. This movie could have excluded so much and it would have been a better movie. It was worth the price of admission and not a total bomb."

The explosions were bigger, transformations cooler and the Transformers had much more personality. <br/><br/>Key things that make TF2 awesome- + As already stated, the action is even better than the first and that is saying a TON. + They realized just how captivating Megan Fox was and maximized her screen time. + Some of the robots are hilarious compared to the original where non of them had much of a personality. + The acting was good all the way around<br/><br/>The negatives were few but they are certainly there. - They should have realized from the first film that the movie would be at least 20 minutes shorter. Even with full tilt action it starts seeming to be a little much after two hours. You need a deep plot and character development if you are going to go as long as these two films did. - This film is FAR LESS family friendly. I have yet to talk to a friend who has seen TF2 and didn't agree that the cursing and sexual references are at least 10 times that of the original. If you are an adult then the jokes and references are quite comical but they aren't something I particularly wanted my kids to watch. I'm sure some will disagree but this is just on father's opinion.<br/><br/>That about covers my thoughts on TF2. My rating of 9/10 is for adults.

","I saw this movie a few days after release, so i entered the theater pessimistically. The movie started off with a comedic edge, which was probably the most enjoyable part of the movie. Once the action started things got confusing.<br/><br/>A big difference between revenge of the fallen and the first one is the strength of the deceptagons. Remember in transformers 1 where megatron was simply invincible until blasted by the cube? Not this time around. This time a few rounds from a human tank is enough to severely wound and transformer.<br/><br/>This really took away from the fact that the autobots were so outnumbered by machines bigger then them. But once the action started, you couldn't tell the villains apart unless they were talking or you were close enough to see there face. The autobots were a little more distinguished because of there bright colors.<br/><br/>The acting was once again pretty good, apart from a few tag-a-longs that were written into the plot.<br/><br/>The plot had an obvious problem. One, there were too many characters for the movies own good, which resulted in almost an hour of unnecessary crap. Steven Spielberg crossed a few lines between producer and director here as he sent shia laboeouf to Egypt and had him solving riddles.<br/><br/>Overall the messy (but fun) action sequences weren't enough to make us ignore the plot entirely.

It may not be the greatest attempt, and a little long, but the movie is at least enjoyable. But, the story does lack, and certain parts of the film are cringe worthy. The movie is undeniably aimed to bring the teenagers in and coax them with visuals that are astonishing and plenty of sex jokes.

Some of the jokes seemed a little forced in this one. And there was cussing that didn't have to be used. Also the majority of the movie was shot in the desert which seemed a little boring. The characters did good jobs and they used everyone from the first movie.

Overall good movie but not too sure if it was as good as the first one!"
"ennieday09","6","1","5","27 June 2009"," One of those movies you're almost FORCED to like, and thats not a good thing....
","So i decided to give my review of this movie because it is in my opinion one of the most hyped most not just this summer, but probably this year. The Transformers phenomenon started in 2007 when Michael Bay introduced us to the famous Hasbro toy line come to the big screen. The first movie was a huge success and surpasses everyones expectations.....the sequel however, could not live up to the hype it was meant to be in my opinion. <br/><br/>OK so let me start by saying i am the type of guy who doesn't mind a little mindless action and special effects blowing up every single minute, basically a good Michael Bay film. But i am also the type of person who looks for all aspects in a movie and Revenge of the Fallen is missing many of those aspects. I saw Revenge of the Fallen at the midnight showing and was excited and ready just like everyone else who went to see it. The first 5 minutes of this film automatically give you the tone the movie was going to give throughout, lots and lots of action and special effects. Hot cars, awesome fighting robots and big explosions. But of course, like many action packed movies, most of the focus is on the fighting sequences than the dialog or character development. <br/><br/>Once the fighting robots and awesome cars clear the dust, we are introduced to the human stars of the movies. The first time we see Sam's eccentric mother already made me feel awkward about the humor in this movie. The writers seemed to put too many comedic punch lines in the movie when it was not needed AT ALL(i.e the ""weed"" scene and Shia's sidekick Leo has many of those) And i am sorry Megan Fox, in my opinion you are the hottest woman in the world right now, but you still CANT ACT FOR YOUR LIFE!! Anyways, and of course i bring the topic of probably the biggest controversy in the entire movie, the introduction of the two new Twin robots in Skids and Mudflap. The writers seriously must have been smoking some serious stuff when deciding to portray these two characters in this manner because it almost ruined the film for me entirely. When i first here their voices, sounding ghetto and uneducated, i thought OK they wanted to add a little humor to the characters thats fine no biggy. But the ongoing ridiculous dialog and punchlines throughout the film was absolutely horrendous. Ex: talking about ""busting a cap in someone's ass"" and admitting they are illiterate and cannot read. Oh yeah, and one of the robots even has a gold tooth which falls off in one of the action sequences. I think the movie would have been exactly the same, maybe even better if the characters were not introduced at all.<br/><br/>Another major reason this film was slightly disappointing was The main villain, The Fallen. I say this because they should have just named the movie Transformers: Revenge of Megatron because The Fallen had absolutely NO IMPACT on the audience in the sense of how powerful a main villain should be. He didn't have an amazing presence, a resurrection or introduction to the film, he just seemed to be there and be like ""Hey look im the Fallen, and almighty god Decepticon that makes other Decepticons do my dirty work."" Megatron was still the main bad ass in this movie and the Fallen was just there to add more characters in my humble opinion. There were many other villains in the movie that i seemed to just forget about considering they were just added to only please the fan boys and more characters. <br/><br/>In conclusion, the title of this post speaks for itself because in my case, going into one of the most hyped movies of the year at the midnight opening you are almost forced to like it considering the great action sequences and special effects. After reading this you may think i did not like this movie at all but not true. I loved the action and no one is better at blowing this up than Michael Bay but the aftermath of watching a big blockbuster film you will realize how simple the movie really is. The biggest thing to do in Hollywood in my opinion is to follow up a huge successful movie to an even better sequel and this movie proves that making it better is no easy task. I still recommend anyone who is a fan of the first one or even a fan of just good action to go see it but don't expect anything CLOSE to lets say a Dark Knight or anything Oscar worthy. Still think it will break many records at the box-office however."
"Zwickky","6","1","5","27 June 2009"," Fun, but way too long and too many explosions.
","Transformers Revenge of the Fallen, the story was sound and had a lot of humor too, but there were way too many things going on at once to tell what's really going on in that particular scene. Now I know a lot of parents out there are getting mad because they were bringing their children to go see it and complaining about how the movie was...expletive for lack of better word. I know their target audience were boys that age 10-15, but if you don't want to heed the warning on the rating then don't complain about the swearing and sexual themes. And lastly the movie was way too long. If I want to watch two and a half hours of explosions and story remnants I'll buy or rent an extended version of the film. You didn't see the whole Lord of the Rings movies in the theater they all got extended through the DVD release. So long story short..he-he..they should have shortened it, then extended it upon DVD release. So to sum it all up; OK storyline, cut down on explosions, if you're going to take kids to see this be prepared to take whatever comes your way, and two and a half hours of explosions and a mediocre storyline shouldn't release until DVD. So all in all it wasn't awful but not too great 6/10"
"uruseiranma","5","1","5","27 June 2009"," Michael Bay is off the leash, and back in action.
","With the first ""Transformers"" film in 2007, it seemed as if Michael Bay had gone in for therapy, given that his forte for hot cars, hotter girls, and bigger explosions was slightly toned down under the auspices of Executive Producer Steven Spielberg. The film seemed to actually hold some promise that Bay was able to tell a story that could allow the audiences to maybe 'care' moreso for the people who generally came and went with the same rapid-fire emotion of a television commercial.<br/><br/>""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" was touted as being bigger and badder than the first film (though almost all sequels try to outdo their predecessor). However, it feels moreso like a Transformer who keeps melding with more and more Transformers, until it's so large, that it can't function properly.<br/><br/>Bay's visuals and storytelling aesthetics that seemed to have grown slightly in the first film have been severely limited as he tries to weave a story involving Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) trying to grow up, as well as come to terms with his relationship with Mikaela(Megan Fox). This is also further intertwined with a Decepticon-destroying branch of the Army working in conjunction with the Autobots, as well as a plotpoint that tries to bring some deeper information regarding Transformers lore to the big-screen.<br/><br/>With so much going on, even some of the Autobots that many had grown to like in the first film are severely underused, such as Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. Front and center for much of the 'Autobot screen-time' are a couple of jive-talking bumblers named Skids and Mudflap. Bay has claimed that he developed them for humorous purposes, but very little of what passes from their lips is humorous, instead seeming annoying(if there's anything positive about them, it's that they have slightly less voice-time than Jar-Jar Binks in 'Episode 1').<br/><br/>In the end, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" comes off as being summer eye-candy, as your brain rushes to absorb myriad plotpoints, people talking incredibly fast, disorienting camera moves, and humorous word and sight gags that would make any 10-year-old boy burst into laughter, but cause most of those who are older to cock an eyebrow."

There is quite a bit of crude sexual humor, and a good deal of cussing. Nevermind all of the violence.

"thumblings","6","1","5","27 June 2009"," Transformer Politics, or How Obama Almost Destroyed the World?
","Except for being a relentless jumble of exploding cars and shattering metal, the Transformers are also a political allegory with a very clear message and, for me, this is what saved this otherwise mediocre film. The movie opens with an alliance of US troops and Autobots leading the war on Decpticons all over the world. The war is shown as destructive and with great amount of civilian casualties and yet needed for the survival of mankind. This is clearly an allegory for the war on terror. Halfway throughout the movie, a new president comes to power and is called ""Obama"" by name. The choice to use a real president's name is very important here, because many people consider Obama not simply yet another president but as someone absolutely new and different and this movie attempts to show us to where this new kind of president will lead us. Soon, the president decides that his alliance with the Autobots is the reason why the Decpticons attack humanity and demands that his robotic allies live Earth in hopes that this will appease his robotic enemies. It is interesting to note here that while the president issues an order demanding the Autobots leave, he does not make the same request from the Decpticons, nor does he in any way condemns their actions. This can be compared with how America is abandoning its ally and forefront in the war on terror, Israel, in favor of trying to negotiate some sort of a peace deal with radical Islam. Just as the fictional Obama demanded the Autobots leaved their new land, which is followed by the noble Optimus Prime's destruction at the hands of a horde of Decpticons, so does the real Obama demands Israelis leave their new land (stop the settlement construction) which the director implies will be followed by Israel's fall at the hands of the Arabs. A particularly poignant moment in which this approach is demonstrated is the scene where Sam is captured by Megatron. The boy admits to have killed Megatron in the past, says he understands the giant robot must be ""annoyed*, I would be annoyed too"" and then proposes to open a clean slate and start negotiations. This is almost a paraphrase of Obama's ""historical"" speech in Cairo and, repeated in this situation, it is shown just how naive and futile it is, in the face of a monstrous inhuman enemy that has a very long blood score to settle with you. The immediate result is an all-out assault of the Decpticons on Earth. Curiously, this attack is compared with 9/11 and it is explicitly stated that Obama hides in a bunker which, as you might remember, is one of the accusations liberals often made against Bush's conduct following the 9/11 attacks. The movie's grand finale, in which the fate of the world is decided, conveniently takes place in the Middle East on the Egyptian-Jordanian border. The heroes, out-gunned and outnumbered, have to rely on the aid of the Arab soldiers, who prove to be woefully incompetent and no match for the Decpticons. A curious fact is that Israel, with its powerful air force, also borders that same spot and yet the movie repeatedly ignores Israel's existence, to the point of Israel's name not appearing on Sam's map as he's driving in the area. In the last moment, however, we see the American army in all its glory (the scene looks almost like a ""join the marines!"" commercial) landing on the Egyptian shore, against the president's orders. The soldiers fight heroically and inflict considerable casualties on the enemy, but it is not until the Autobots join in to aid in the ungrateful humans, that the battle is finally won. Eventually, American and Autobot presence in the Middle East proved to be essential for humanity's survival while the ""moderate Arab regimes"" turned out to be a useless ally. As a side note, I would like to mention another shot the movie takes at the Obama administration. Torture (which Obama declared a war on) is shown in the movie in an extremely positive light. The information which Mikaela eventually wrestles for the tiny Decpticon she captured proves vital in saving the world from the Decpticon's plan. Had she treated her prisoner more humanely the Matrix would never have been found and the Fallen's plan to take out the sun would have went on unhindered.<br/><br/>*This isn't a quote from the movie. The original uses a slightly more explicit language."

Michael bay did a fantastic job with this movie, i put my hat down... there's also rumors that it has the biggest explosion in movie history....maybe...i won't say nothing.<br/><br/>final word...if you are a fan of transformers or a fan of action, or you watched the 1 movie, there is ABSOLUTELY no reason why you shouldn't watch this one.<br/><br/>and ignore all the bad comments would you, those people just don't understand the world of TRANSFORMERS."

"d_n10","7","1","5","26 June 2009"," Great movie for all.
","Part 1 ""Transformers"" should be watched first before viewing this film as background knowledge and understanding will allow for a better viewing.<br/><br/>As a University student in Sydney, I expected a lengthy adventure worth my concession fee in tickets and this was exactly what I got.<br/><br/>The movie had something from almost every genre of film, comedy, action, sci-fi, romance as well as drama and adventure. There was something for everybody and this is probably why the first transformers did so well.<br/><br/>This sequel however had everything part 1 had and more. The story line is as expected at first with Sam (Shia Lebeouf) trying to live a normal life by going to college and trying to make his relationship with his hot girlfriend (Megan Fox) work. With the everyday struggle of a adolescent on his shoulders, Sam still has to hide his pass role in assisting an alien species of transforming robots to live on Earth. He also has to hide the fact that his car is one of these transforming robots. All though this seems easy, it is actually quite difficult as the director and producers of the film will show.<br/><br/>After having contact with a piece of the all-spark, Sam begins to see visions of a secret language of the transformers. Despite these effects on him, Sam remains in college trying to live a normal life. Meanwhile, the US army work together with the Autobots in tracking down all possible Decepticons still living on Earth. A breakthrough is made when the assisting Decepticons discover where their leader (Megatron) was hidden. This is when the film kicks to another gear.<br/><br/>Great cinematography in the action scenes and special effects, nothing like most have seen. As this is possible the most expensive movie this year with a outrageous 300 million dollar price-tag, expect to be blown away.<br/><br/>A very good movie by today's standards as the anticipation and wait created by the announcement of this movie being made will be rewarded. One downside to the movie, boredom and restlessness may kick in towards the middle as what is expected to happen is prolonged. This is all worthwhile however with the stunning actress's in Megan Fox and Isabelle Lucas providing visual entertainment for most parts of the movies.<br/><br/>Good acting by Shia and Megan allow adolescents to relate and include themselves in the situations which is a bonus for the movie. Great camera work and special effects makes this movie one of the best and worthwhile films of the year."

Although some people have been saying it was not what they expected, and I respect their opinions, however I believe that people are way too hyper critical of this movie and should just learn to accept that this is a Transfomers movie and yes there is going to be a lot of action, so just enjoy it instead of being so hyper critical. Even though the first Transformers may have been a little bit better with a better storyline it still was great. I love the series and am happy it is going to be a trilogy. <br/><br/>The only reason holding this movie back from getting a ten is due to the fact that Meagan Fox was such a poor actor in this movie focusing more on her looks then the movie."

The first one was pretty good, but this one just really takes the cake. I don't know how they plan on making a third one that can be better than this unless they decided to make Megan Fox go rated R ha ha.

","In the fun sequel to the 2007 mega-billion dollar hit, Transformers, Shia Labeouf returns as Sam Witicky. This time Sam is going to college only to realize Deciptacon is mad about what happened, and wants revenge. Megan Fox returns as his motor-cycling riding girlfriend Mikaela. She helps him stop Deciptacon. This time, though, there are two new characters, Leo (Ramon Rodriguez), Sam's college dorm mate forced to help them fight Deciptacon, and Agent Simmons, A.K.A. Robo Warrior (John Turturro), an expert who helps them fight the battle. The movie goes between hysterical cut-aways from the battle, and spectacular battle scenes. It does lose focus at points, but who cares for an action film? This is a real treat, especially for fans of the first one, like myself. It is fun, however, it is kind of uneven, and it is too long. That said, if you want to have fun at the movies, go no further than seeing this. I'm a little skeptical in certain areas, but I still loved it."
"jovidude24","10","1","5","25 June 2009"," awesomely fantastic
","I don't care what people say, Michael Bay is an awesome director. I mean outstanding, you can't beat this movie this year. Summer block buster of the year right here. I have been waiting for this movie to come out for two years! And you know what, didn't disappoint. A few things wrong with it though. My biggest peeve is that they didn't bring Jazz back, I loved him! Oh well, gotta live with what you got. Another thing that got on my nerve was the constant sex thing they tried implanting, with the auto-bot wheelie and the dogs in the beginning. That wasn't really needed honestly. But I gotta say, Mr. Bay did even better with effects especially with the robot blood. Awesome and the carnage between the two were fantastic. The love story between Sam and Mikaela added a lot of drama. Tom Kenney was hilarious as skids and wheelie by the way. I would love to see them again in the next film. Shia did the best in acting once again, in lieu of his accident with his hand. It was easy to explain that in the film once you see it. Which you will and you better, you will not be disappointed."
"OptimusPrime2004","9","1","5","25 June 2009"," A Summer Blockbuster Hit
","Let me start off saying I am a huge g1 transformers fan. I enjoyed the the first movie and I also enjoyed this one. This movie is exactly what its supposed to be. A huge action flick with lots of explosions. Yes they don't look like the original transformers but this is 2009 not 1985. A volkswagon beetle, mini van, station wagon, flat nosed truck, and so on would look retarded in 2009. All you die hard fans who complain about it might want to refresh on the old cartoons. The old cartoons had hardly any continuation. New characters popped up and disappeared randomly with no explanation, and there were crazy story lines (anyone remember when they found the gold pond that made them all invincible?). This update brings a lot of good things along with some bad. Would you rather have all this action or hardly any action( x- men:3). Before I went to see it people on here were complaining about the SE saying they couldn't tell who was who in the fights. I didn't have that problem( I guess I have great vision). The action in this movie was fantastic. The story was odd, but acceptable. This was exactly what most people expected, a great action flick to past the time, I wasn't hoping for an amazing story, I just wanted to see prime and the boys shut megatron up. My only gripes were that You didn't see a lot of ratchet or Iron Hide. And The BIGGEST problem was I don't recall ever hearing Prime say ""Autobots, Transform and ROLL OUT!"" <br/><br/>So in conclusion, If you want a good action film with descent humor, good cgi, and lots of explosions and action this is a great choice. IF you are a Die Hard fanboy who feels it should be just like the original cartoons, you will be disappointed. Or If you go in there looking for dramatic heart tugging scenes worthy of an Oscar you will be disappointed. This is a great movie for action fans."
"laxman5127","6","1","5","25 June 2009"," Good, but succumbs to the greatness of the first one...
","Upon seeing the film, I read early reviews slamming the film in its entirety. I saw an IMAX showing for this on the opening day, and I was not disappointed with the special effects at all, in fact, the quality and quantity of explosions and crashes and booms and bangs overall in the film was the best thing about it. The rest of the movie, disappointingly, was flawed in every aspect of the film compared to its predecessor, otherwise, it was still a fun ride. In short, its not awful...its just the first one but not nearly as good.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot and general writing seemed to have been an identical copy of the first one with a few tweaks. There were the occasional funny and stupid one-liners and the same humor the first one gave. In addition, the number of robots in the film was so immense i walked out not knowing any of their names (save for the ones returning from the first film) and some of which have so little screen time there is no point to seeing them in the film anyway.<br/><br/>The general thought i had when I saw this movie was that Bay sought to top number 1 with MORE OF EVERYTHING. He even dragged this one out an additional 20 minutes. Although it seems harmless (as I thought before seeing it), the plot is so minimal there was virtually no point to stretching it out that far. Also, the action scenes were way more animated; however, the editing only nauseates. The scenes had the potential to be excellent, yet this was one factor holding them back.<br/><br/>Another argument is the stage-time of the human eye candy in the film (aka Megan Fox). Much of the films emptiness centers around her character. Although she is very HOT, she takes up too much time and overall what she does waste in the film pulls the rest of the movie down.<br/><br/>Now for the good things! I did enjoy the action scenes even though some seemed very far-fetched and overlong. The acting was suitable for the film too, and the comic delivery was par with the first film. Overall, there are things to criticize in this movie simply because it didn't match up with the first film, yet it is still a thrill ride and an lots of fun! This is still definitely worth seeing in theaters despite the flaws!"

When the film ended, everybody even me started to cheer. The movie stars off great, and by time it gets even better. I say that I couldn't have wished for a better movie. It was more than perfect, and so much better than the first one. I am sure that most people will love it. The movie has a mysterious way of combining thriller with comedy. It is worth watching over 1,000 times, I am bound to go back into theaters and see it again. I have to give this movie a 1,000 of 10.

","Just like the first one, this one was a lot of fun to watch. My kind of movie. I read the bad reviews by the ""Experts"" and I did not see what they were talking about. I loved all the military angles and I thought the plot was good. When I come out of a movie and it leaves me with a good feeling then the director did their job. All I know is some of these movies the critics love leave me with the feeling of what the heck was that? If you loved the first Transformers movie you will love this one also. The slow motion action scenes were fun to watch. This movie did not drag on or seem like it lasted 4 hours, it flew by and left me wanting more. Optimus Prime was very impressive, fighting like a true leader and not like a thug or killing machine that I read elsewhere. So go see it and have fun."
"3xHCCH","6","1","5","25 June 2009"," Exciting Yes. But Also Disappointing
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is as exciting as summer blockbusters go. The signature Michael Bay explosions are definitely there. The machinery and the cars were all a great sight to see, as well as Megan Fox. The robot transformations scenes, the chase scenes, the fight scenes, all very excellently staged and executed as far as visual effects are concerned.<br/><br/>However, for this particular blockbuster, I think the main problem is story-telling. When we understand what the Fallen meant, it seemed insignificant already. Focus is seriously lacking. It seems that story telling fell secondary to the explosive special effects and occasionally lame comedy schticks (particularly from Sam's mom and his roommate Leo).<br/><br/>Part of this problem is time management. Everything in the script took too long to tell on screen. One example of a particularly over-long sequence is the climactic run of Sam to deliver the Matrix to Optimus Prime. It was one very extended series of indistinguishable gun battles interrupted by seemingly endless scenes of our two heroes running. Of course, these running scenes had to be in slow motion in order to emphasize Megan's jiggling anatomy for the boys in the audience (haha!)<br/><br/>As a whole, it is OK for a lazy afternoon with the kids, as we did so today. The kids found it awesome and extreme, as could be predicted. However, we know there could have been better story-telling by its director, who seemed to be more concerned with the superficial embellishments rather than the core spirit of the story."

The movie tried to tell 4 different story lines at once and succeeded at this on the first one, but was way to jumpy this time around. But come on people. ITS AN ACTION MOVIE. If you really walked into this movie expecting more that what it delivers then you really need to reexamine your definition of ACTION film. Ill admit that it got kind of stupid at times but really is it any more stupid then Terminator Salvation. It's giant robots beating the crap out of each other, not Slumdog Millionaire. Just remember that."
"JediMasterWRW","7","1","5","24 June 2009"," It Could Have Been Great
","Transformers was really good, and yet really disappointing at the same time. The effects were superb, and the acting wasn't bad either. The story could have used more depth, but that's forgivable.<br/><br/>The main issue with this movie is all of the sexual innuendos. The first movie had one awkward scene that most people could only cringe through. This movie assaulted me from the beginning with a dog (Mojo) asserting his dominance on another male dog, and continued to have immature sexual references all throughout.<br/><br/>Considering this is a film with a target audience of children as well as adults, I'm extremely disappointed with the writers and the producers. The level of immaturity is too great in several paces for me to allow children to see it. My little brother (he's eight) has been counting down the days until it came into theaters and was trying to convince my family to take him to see it at least a week ago. He's going to be absolutely crushed when we tell him he can't go.<br/><br/>This could have been a really good movie that everyone in the family could see. Instead the writers decided that they would rather include multiple perverse jokes and bar children from the theater.<br/><br/>I would have given Transformers a solid 8.5 or maybe even 9 out of 10 stars. As it is, I can't give it anything higher than a 7. It's so disappointing to me that Hollywood thinks a movie has to be loaded with sex to make it interesting to the average audience. There may be a time and a place for that, but that time and place is *not* in a movie based off of a children's cartoon."
"clydetheseal","7","1","5","24 June 2009"," Good but did not live up to expectations.
","Liked the beginning, flashback to 17,000 BC was kinda cool, kinda cheesy. The first fight scene in Shanghai with Lennex and the Autobots was pretty awesome, I wish there'd been more of Arcee though. (That's the chick Autobot!) A lot of the exposition after the college scenes and the race across Egypt were too drawn out, scenes could have been cut or shortened. The ""I love you."" and its ""your destiny"" were way too clichéd and just cheesy. The very ended was cut short and felt rushed. Bang we won! Now one sentimental message and no after footage, oh movie's over. Sequel coming, you can tell.<br/><br/>The best moment in the whole movie was the way they worked Simons back in. That was brilliant. Jetfire was also incredible. At last a ""I'm too old for this."" from a guy who was still easily winning the fight. Mikaela' pet Decepticon was also cool, and hilarious, but he vanished in Egypt. I missed him after that.<br/><br/>Overall: Too much exposition, too many random robots with no explanation, too many Decepticons, too much Mikaela, too much room mate, too long of a fight across the desert. Not enough back story on characters, not enough Bumblebee, not enough Arcee, not enough of a final fight at the pyramids.<br/><br/>It was a good movie, it just didn't quite meet the great standards set by the first one."
"cubskool101","6","1","5","24 June 2009"," Good summer movie, but also typical Michael Bay.
","I went into this movie not expecting a whole lot. I expected it to be nothing different than the first one. Loads of special effects and CGI, but also cheesy lines with a very thin plot. That is Bay's style of directing.<br/><br/>I would have to say this movie is for some people and not for others. If you enjoyed the first movie, I am pretty sure you will enjoy the second.<br/><br/>Do not listen to all of these users giving this movie 1 star. There is a plot, (very thin but there is one), the dialog is not very well put together but thats not what Transformers is about. Its about entertainment and if your into things blowing up for 2 and a half hours, then you will like it."
"elcubano1023","9","1","5","24 June 2009"," Revenge of the Fallen Is probably the Biggest Movie of the Summer
","Well, the first thing one must realize when going to see this movie is that it's Transformers, big robots fighting other big robots on our planet. It's NOT going to have the best acting *cough* Megan Fox *cough* and it's NOT going to have the most recognizable plot. It IS going to have mind-blowing action scenes, CGI, special effects, explosions, and incredibly hot slow-mo scenes of a extremely attractive woman *cough* Megan Fox *cough* running from said explosions.<br/><br/>Of course, the INCREDIBLY realistic effects (especially the sound, the sound in this movie was epic) can only compensate for so much. There are some scenes where you squirm in your seat because of the cheesiness, or maybe leave you wondering ""Am I really the only one who's able to see that, where's the military, where are the Autobots?"" or ""Hey Mike, can you zoom out a little and stop spinning so much, I'm getting motion-sickness"" But these feelings are soon forgotten in an impressive display of big robots beating the crap out of bigger robots while our mere human race scurries underneath the destruction of our most esteemed architectural achievements.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought Revenge of the Fallen was better than the first, but it is definitely debatable. In the first movie, with new perspective of Fallen, it seemed everything was held back a little. I mean, when you're making a two hour live action movie from a set of toy action figures, you want to test the waters first, but the success of the first movie is what made this one so good. Michael Bay and the producing staff or whatever went all out, on everything. Sam's parents are crazier and more lovable than before, Megan Fox's acting HAS improved, it's funnier, and there's at least twice as many fighting scenes done at least twice as well as in the first Bay production of Transformers.<br/><br/>Overall, this is definitely the movie to see this summer if you don't see anything else. It has everything: action, explosions, hotness, comedy (personally, I loved the twins), explosions, hotness, romance, action, sentimental moments, and above all, giant robots blowing sh*t up. Don't be deterred by the 2 1/2 hour run-time, because if it were any shorter, this movie would seem like it was over too soon. Albeit, I'm a 16 year old male, so my opinion may be a little biased to say the least, but Michael Bay was the perfect man to make this film happen, and it will leave everyone who goes to see it walking out happy."
"predatornut","6","1","5","22 June 2009"," Bigger, better and longer.
","Grab your shades and prepare for the lens flares!<br/><br/>I'm a sci-fi fan, but never really got into Transformers until I saw the 2007 film. I thought it had some cool moments in it and I did enjoy it, but thought that the movie had a little too much out of place comedy and that their coverage of many of the robot fights wasn't too hot.<br/><br/>In Revenge of the Fallen, Bay's moved on from showcasing intensely blurry closeups of Optimus Prime's ankle to providing proper titanic scale battles that aren't covered using MTV's camera crew. The level of action really blew me away and I was quite impressed with the visual effects which I thought were way beyond what they were able to do in the first film. Granted there's a good deal of human drama in there too, done in Michael Bay's typical cheesified style. It's fun to watch, the new ""girl"" providing a nice twist to the standard love triangle idea.<br/><br/>Revealing the ancient history of the autobots and decepticons further was interesting and even if they were a bit nauseating at times, I liked the hyperactive minibots that they brought in. My only problems were the runtime, which was a bit excessive, and the lack of characterization with the Fallen guy.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and think it's got the energy and feeling of excitement that the first one lacked a little.

","Sequels are hard to make, you have a plot to continue, characters to continue to develop, and expectations from fans to surpass. Michael Bay and company seem to have found a way around that, and that is to not do any of these things.<br/><br/>The plot of the first Transformers may not have been the best, but it worked for that movie while this movie manages to disregard the plot of original and goes off in a new direction resembling a retarded version of National Treasure mixed with War of the Worlds. It fails to be interesting or intelligent.<br/><br/>Most of the major characters return, one noticeable loss is Jon Voight as the secretary of defense. although the characters seem oblivious to the events of the previous film this is not the main failing of the movie, it is the dialog. While the first movies dialog ranged from decent to good this movie stayed in Pearl Harbor territory almost the whole time with the only tolerable lines delivered by the main autobots and decepticons. Another problem is the inclusion of new autobots and decepticons there are so many thrown into this movie that you do not care or sometimes even notice when they meet their demise. However there are two new autobots Skids and Mudflap who you will notice because the movie forces you to. They both horribly annoying ethnic stereotypes that add nothing to the movie.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is intense if not slightly confusing. While the action scenes in this movie are on par with the first movie they couldn't overcome the horrible story. Unlike the first movie in which the action builds up over time to thrilling climax. This one just has action throughout. While the action in it is good it never builds to a true climax.<br/><br/>It seems Michael Bay pulled a Ghostbusters 2 on us, sure the movie has the same characters and subject matter but it is severely lacking in the areas where it counts."

Not because I can see the future or I think no one else than Bay can do it, but because Transformers 2 is a huge fail and everyone who has seen the movie in the theatres (and everyone is doing it since no one believes what a bad movie this really is) won't be there to watch Transformers 3. Now the guys who will give the money for this are expecting a huge blockbuster which gives millions of $$, because Transformers 1 + 2 were such awesomely done flicks (in their head, maybe because of $$).<br/><br/>Now get inside yourself for one minute and think about who will get the blame if Transformers 3 won't be such a huge success?<br/><br/>So if you hate directing and want to look for another job, this is your chance.<br/><br/>And yes, this is my way of expressing how shitty the movie was (compared to the possibilities)."

Come on, its a damn shame and worse way to spend a Saturday night to see this horrible sequel and its so bad that it puts itself into Status Lock. However, i will say some good things about this movie. The effects were still good, the voice acting was crisp and he action was insane. Still, there is a lot to improve on.

But the overall script for the movie was just terrible. The humor in the first movie was a bit much but still tolerable.

I saw it in thetres waited in a three hour line up just to watch it from the front row. NOT WORTH IT<br/><br/>This movie kind of takes off from the first one it still has Shia and Fox who are dating by this point. Now one thing i hated about these movies was they did not explain much about the transformers in the first one so i assumed they were going to get right into it in this one. Boy was i wrong. This movie is about 40 minutes of explanation and then about a hour and 45 minutes of explosions and fight sequences. This is mostly because of the directing talents of Bay. He tries to replace story line and substance with explosions and noise.<br/><br/>So I walked out of the thetre feeling bored and frankly a little motion sick from all the fast moving action that never seemed to end.Frankly i did not enjoy this movie after the first 40 minutes and im sure the 3rd will be the exact same. 4/10"
"IllusionOfLife","3","1","6","27 June 2011"," Embarrassingly Bad
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen Rating: F <br/><br/>WARNING: Review may contain minor spoilers but I promise not to include anything you can't already see in the trailers. <br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the second live-action movie based on the Hasbro toys. It is directed by Michael Bay and stars Shia LeBeouf and Megan Fox. The story is set (I'm guessing) two years after the original and tells the story of Sam Witwicky going to college, and the Autobots fighting the remaining Decepticons, and a giant alien-baddie who (surprise, surprise) doesn't like humans, and who knows what else. <br/><br/>So first off I want to say that when I saw the first Transformers on Blu-Ray I was impressed at how much I enjoyed a movie based on car action figures, granted I wouldn't say it was one of the greatest movies ever but I was pleasantly surprised and I genuinely enjoyed it. Unfortunately I can't say the same for Revenge of the Fallen. That's not to say I hated the movie, the action was really fun, some of the scenes were really cool, and I was never bored. However as a whole it was poorly crafted, lazily written, and filled with gags that might as well have been written by Middle School Boys. <br/><br/>Now before I get anyone saying ""But it's a dumb action movie, that's how it's supposed to be!"" Allow me to point out first, that with our recent streak of Smart action movies (i.e. The Dark Knight, Star Trek, Casino Royale) that excuse doesn't hold as much water, and second it is possible to make a ""dumb"" action movie that is well crafted and doesn't have to resort to immature sex jokes to get a reaction (i.e. Terminator Salvation, Iron Man). <br/><br/>The story of the movie just went where ever it wanted and felt like it had no direction aside from ""Hey wouldn't it be cool to have robots fight in China? Yeah! Now let's have them fight in Egypt!"" Also the characters were all one-dimensional and had no development, and many acted in ways that contradict the way they had been established in the first movie. For instance: Megatron, the nigh-unstoppable menace from the first movie spent two hours of this movie being the Fallen's lap dog. <br/><br/>The absolute worst thing about this movie was the incessant immature humor. The first film had one scene that, while embarrassing, was forgivable because it only happened once, but this movie couldn't get through ten minutes without including an unnecessary and unfunny sexual or racial gag. And speaking of racial, two characters called ""The Twins"" were terrible! Imagine Jar Jar Binks times two plus horrible racial stereotypes. I'm normally one to reach for my barf-bag when someone uses the term ""politically correct"" but these characters felt more like they were designed for Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs (look it up on Wikipedia) than a modern action film. <br/><br/>When I found out that this movie had several scenes filmed in the full IMAX aspect ratio my mind instantly went to the amazing IMAX work done with The Dark Knight, so I payed the extra money to see this in IMAX and to my disappointment only one sequence was filmed entirely in IMAX and only two others contained any IMAX footage at all, a huge let down when compared to the extensive IMAX work that Christopher Nolan had done with The Dark Knight. So if you are considering seeing the IMAX version I recommend saving your money (although watching Optimus Prime fight 4 or 5 decepticons solo in the middle of the movie was pretty epic in full IMAX). <br/><br/>This movie was by all means terrible, but it did have a few redeeming qualities. Yes, it was poorly crafted and embarrassing at parts but it was a fun movie to watch and I am glad that I saw it. However I would not go out of my way to watch it again. Let's hope that Michael Bay will take a little more care in making the next film (probably not just looking at the box office scores, but here's hoping)."
"tomdude0","5","1","6","16 June 2011"," Fun to watch, but that's pretty much it
","So...remind me what exactly this movie was about.<br/><br/>There's no SCRIPT. The film just wanders aimlessly for two hours and only starts remotely making sense in the last half hour. It's like the filmmakers were just making it up as they went. There was hardly even a plot.<br/><br/>What was left somewhat saved the movie. The action sequences and jokes made it pretty fun to watch.

That's just scratching the surface. <br/><br/>Let's just say this movie is one of the few that literally made me feel like my IQ dropped as I left."

I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the Cinema or I probably would've asked for my money back.<br/><br/>I fast forwarded through so much of the start of this movie. The whole college thing was honestly just really crap. You think people making that much money could write something with some decent story line to it. You write writes could make new things rather than rehashing their own previous substance into a totally different movie. The whole star wars thing can be seen so obviously it made it unbearable. I mean when Megatron was talking to his boss like Darth Vadar was with the Emperor the boss guy uses the whole 'much to learn my apprentice' lines. And the dead brothers appearing to Sam saying 'its your destiny'. Might as well been Luke skywalker having yudo and rest of them appearing saying its your destiny. I mean come on!!! <br/><br/>Even if you can get past the really really really bad story, failed character development, failed romantic sub story which was just plain hopeless and the fast forward through pretty much over half of the movie I still wouldn't want to pay to see this.<br/><br/>What's worse is that it made so much money that they all think they did an awesome job and going to make another one! I really hope the rest of the population that found the 'same old, same old' action scenes and CGI entertaining in this movie don't do same again on next one so they finally get the picture that just cause you have a big budget with big flashing special effects doesn't make it a good movie! I couldn't even finish it because it just got so retarded and far fetched and that's saying something. Anyone else agree?"
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","6","4 April 2011"," Has the appeal of throwing pots and pan down a set of stairs
","I had a conversation once with a former associate who argued that the best way to enjoy the films of director Michael Bay was to simply sit back, turn off my brain and enjoy them. What he was saying essentially is that I needed to simply lower my standards and ask for less. Note that I said this was a former associate.<br/><br/>Michael Bay makes blockbusters. He makes them loud, crude, violent and profitable. He made 'Armageddon', about rocks that threaten to destroy earth. He made 'The Rock', about a terrorist that threatens to destroy San Francisco. He made 'Pearl Harbor' about how the Japanese destroyed a navel base. Are you seeing a pattern here? He makes profitable films in which things get blow'd up real good. His excuse is that he makes films for audiences, not critics. Well, so did Hitchcock, but at least Hitch wanted to play us like a piano, not like a set of drums.<br/><br/>'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' is a loud, crude, dumbbell action picture that has the appeal of throwing a set of cookware down a long staircase. The heroes and villains are robots from another world who can disguise themselves as mobile objects like cars, jets, tanks etc. They can even take the form of household objects like toasters or blenders. The reason they are here on earth is laid out in incomprehensible dialogue that I really I could not follow. It really doesn't matter anyway. The final scenes are an assault of noisy special effects and whip-cut editing that never allow you to get your bearings. Its like the movie was made to be a two-and-a-half-hour trailer for itself.<br/><br/>The robots are seen early and often. There is no build-up or mystery about them at all. They are built of a convoluted mess of shiny metal pieces formed into something 40-feet tall with arms and legs. They have faces that aren't expressive but rather hidden by all the metal - it takes you a second or two to decipher where the eyes or the mouth are or if they even have them (why do they need them?). When they speak, they having nothing interesting to say. Their speech comes in three forms: Formal comic book boilerplate (""Die, like your brothers"") and pop culture buzzwords (""Punk-ass Decepticon!"").<br/><br/>They make no logical sense in that you shouldn't ask how a 50-foot robot can contain enough metal to transform into a half-sized pick-up truck.Worse then trying to figure them out is watching them. All they do is fight, smash things and shoot lasers. A lot of things get smashed and a lot of lasers get fired. There are a lot of things that get blown up, a lot of things that get destroyed. The robot's bodies are made of metal, wires and gears. They look like moving scrap-heaps and when you get a bunch together to fight, you can't tell one from another.<br/><br/>You have to ask why creatures from another planet would be metal robots anyway? Why is their speech such a mess of stale mechanical blandness? What do they have to offer besides weapons that can destroy stuff? What is their planet like? Where do they come from? Are there other organic beings out there? Do they know about us? Who built you guys? What's your technology like? How were you able to convincingly create a robot who was a human look-a-like? See, they wouldn't want to visit me because I would never shut up with the questions.<br/><br/>The human characters in the movie aren't smart enough to ask those questions. The males in the movie are either college slobs or military archetype. The female are all gorgeous, smoldering in heat, and dress like Playmates. Shia LeBouf, the hero, runs through this movie looking dazed and confused while shouting at special effects. Megan Fox doesn't fare much better but at least I can give her credit for tiring of this material and bowing out of Transformers 3. The only romantic conflict between LeBeouf and Fox is the idea that he won't tell her that he loves her. Trust me, if a guy has the heart of a girl who looks like Megan Fox, the problem would be getting him to STOP saying it.<br/><br/>Movies like this anger me. They are a determent to this art form that I love. They seem to have been made by people who don't know what movies are suppose to be about. Made by committee, they are filmed deals, made for box office, merchandise and beverage tie-ins. I like movies that ask something of me, they engage me and have a narrative that plays with my senses and my expectations and my sense of wonder. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is, I'm told, a movie that I am suppose to simply sit back and enjoy but, for me, that would be asking me to enjoy getting smacked repeatedly upside the head with a frying pan.<br/><br/>* (of four)"

","Well the makers made a good attempt of making the story jump from one plot to another. But to sum it all up it made me dizzy.<br/><br/>I noticed the transition was not smooth, I can describe it as very exhausting. All of the human characters and the twin robots acted terrible. The humans were noisy, the twin robots we're trying hard to impress Optimus. If the characters and actors died on the previous film they shouldn't be included in the next because they are dead or maybe he was a Transformer too.<br/><br/>Another note is they tried to execute another explosive scene when Sam and Mikaela was running, it wasn't impressive at all. The Skorponok scene on the first film was great and memorable because the weapons used were somewhat new especially the 102 shells. If they were to recreate it, the weapons should something new before seen like smart bombs hitting the Decepticons. Weapons designed from what they have learned from the previous attack.<br/><br/>The story line used in the second installment is acceptable in the late 90s, people have outgrown this type of story telling. What we are looking for are story lines that we can easily relate to, better and mature way of telling a robot war with humans type of story.<br/><br/>I hope more human element will be placed on the next installment so people will appreciate the movie more."

","Michael Bay introduces this film's heroine bent over a motorbike in very short shorts. The only other young female who gets screen time in this film reveals a metallic tail from underneath a very short skirt. Michael Bay doesn't know how to write women.<br/><br/>He has created 2 horrendously stereotypical black robots, gold teeth and large ears included, with names like ""mudflap"" and ""skids"" one of whom proudly proclaims they don't know how to read. Michael bay can't write black characters.<br/><br/>Transformers is a film series derived from a cartoon and toy range. Despite this Michael Bay doesn't mind including words slang word for female genitalia in the dialogue, and featuring a hot lady cyborg (with a tail no less) trying to seduce the hero. Michael Bay does not have a sense of what is appropriate for his target audience.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is very good at displaying all things military. He can make any shot look like he is trying to sell cars- this atrocious advertising slickness where everything mechanical is fetishised. He's very good at orchestrating fight scenes that make NO visual sense- just bits of metal hitting metal. And he's very good at making a film last about an hour longer than it needs to.<br/><br/>Transformers: ROTF is dreadful. One can almost find a strange respect in the epic scale of it's dreadfulness. There's an audacity there, one that suggests many involved in this film have somehow lost touch with the real world. If you have a love of bad films, or find movie clichés hilarious, it may even have some replay value. What it doesn't have is a single believable human character... or a soul."
"freemantle_uk","3","1","6","17 March 2010"," Another poor blockbuster from 2009
","After the success of the first Transformers movies a sequel was bound to happen. The Transformers movie was basically a set up for the first sequels. Here we get another CGI bombastic fest by Michael Bay.<br/><br/>Set 2 years after the first Transformers film, a multi-national military team, NEST has been created and with the Autobots hunt down Decepticons. After a mission in Shanghai Demolishor warns that the Fallen was coming to Earth. In America Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is preparing to go to an East Coast University. Which packing he finds a piece of the AllSpark and by touching it he starts to have images in his head. At the University the sexy Alice (Isabel Lucas) is attached to Sam, who is still loyal to Michaella (Megan Fox). Unknown to Sam, Alice is a Decepticon spy.<br/><br/>In the Decepticon camp, they plan to get the reminding bit of the AllSpark and use it to resurrect Megatron. By doing this Megatron serves the Fallen who a plan to make more followers by stealing the energy of the Sun and thereby killing Earth. After the Decepticons make their present known on Earth and demand that the people of Earth give up Sam. Sam and Michaella become fugitives and with the help of the Autobots set out to save the world once again.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good aspects (or what there are of them) of the film. First the CGI and action is of a high standard and they are fine action sequences, especially with everyone's favourite Transformer, Optimus Prime in the forest. Michael Bay has a flair for this type of film and he also uses less shaky cam then in the previous film. I also enjoy the military aspect of the film and the film should have shown more of this. There are also some fan favourite put into the film, like Soundwave and Ravage. The Fallen is a good villain and Megatron and Starscream have bigger roles, and it is good to see their rivalry on screen. Plus Megan Fox and Isabel Lucas are hot.<br/><br/>Now the bad: the film is way too long. Many of the scenes with Sam, Michaella and Sam's parents were not needed and dragged the film out. The audience don't really care, all we want to see is robots beating the hell out of each other. The story is paper thin and their should have been more effort in the script. The attempts at comedy were poor and the creations of the characters Mudflap and Skip is the worst in the world. They have been criticised for being racist stereotypes (which they are), but the main problem was they are really, REALLY annoying and I was rousing for the Decepticons to kill them. They attempts at comedy was terrible and they were on the screen for way to long; the fans care about characters like Optimus, Bumblebee, Ratchet and Ironside, not the crappy Twins. The film also has a number of plot holes: one great example is that in Transformers Las Vegas was a battleground for giant robots and the American military, and yet the filmmakers expert us to believe the American government was able to cover it up?<br/><br/>The filmmakers should have accepted Transformers for what it was, robots fighting each other, and just made it a fun 2 hour action film. At least the first film had some heart in it.<br/><br/>A poor blockbuster."

Unfortunately for me I'm not a quitter and I was subjected to every last minute of Bay's disaster-piece.<br/><br/>If your more shallow than a puddle you'll probably love this film for it's explosions and ridiculously fast paced action.

The rest of the time the story was terrible and Michael Bay spent most of his time marketing Megan Fox for her sex appeal. She had ZERO significance to this story other than what I just mentioned. If you are a little kid to a teenager, you will probably like this movie for all it is worth. I was just really upset with the whole thing because I was expecting something cool like the first movie.

","With a furious and almost intransigent focus on special effects over story, the 'physical' over the emotional, and the appalling(and unnecessary) attempts at being 'contemporary' and 'humorous', not to mention the relentless pushing of a romantic angle where there wasn't one to be had, make this film a waste of time, money, and a potentially good experience. The director betrays complete disinterest in the(poorly written) human characters and in telling a story and yet expects us to not only relate to them, but to also care about the 'plot' and watch this drivel till the 'epic' finale. In addition, the pathetic soundtrack and the consistently weak acting don't help either. To top it off, rather predictably(and horrifyingly), room is left for yet another sequel! Avoidable."

Pretty much up until Optimus Prime dies, there is no plot. Suddenly, they are whisked off to Egypt for the Matrix of Leadership (which sounds very cheesy by the way). I was very upset that the other Autobots were rarely given dialogue. It felt like the movie was mainly meant to be about Optimus more than the other Autobots.<br/><br/>Now, for the humans in the movie. Shia LaBeouf again did a good job, but i cannot get over the fact that he comes back to life after being killed. He has a vision of the Primes and he's suddenly up and kicking. Like seriously, WTF?! The parents i felt were overused and they perhaps should have been limited to another cameo role, like in the first movie. Josh Duhamel didn't contribute anything new. As did Tyrese Gibson.

This entire film is like watching a child play with his toys. There's no plot worth a damn, just a succession of explosions and running about. Very little makes any kind of sense at all.

If you don't care about the characters, what is the point of watching the film in the first place? Ooooh! Look at the pretty pictures.....Aaaaaah! an explosion! Then later.....what's going on? God help us all when Transformers 3 gets here. Though it's hard to see how even Bay can out-Bay himself next time. I prophesy, however, more mind-numbing repetitive action and explosion sequences. Oh, and even more annoying Gremlin rip-off bots.<br/><br/>Unless your 10 or under, or have a sub-standard IQ, best avoid this direly insulting movie."
"bmrao1980","3","1","6","9 November 2009"," WTF was Bay thinking
","2 Hasbro releases this summer (both of which i saw on DVD)...well, to sum up: i am glad i didn't shell out bucks to see this one on the big screen.<br/><br/>If ever there is an example to be had of wasteful use of technology, this movie is right up there with Battlefield Earth. WTF did i just waste 2.5 hours of my life on!!?<br/><br/>I saw this movie and saw alien robot farts, alien robot balls (as in the male body part, complete with jingling and jangling), illiterate alien robots, and thought (the cliché), Now i have seen everything! <br/><br/>There is no semblance of a story, the dialogues make no sense, the editing is choppy at best, the effects are inconsistent, there is no continuity, the plot holes are bigger and deeper than lunar craters, and the new additions to the robot characters either do nothing to add to the storyline or take away from it.<br/><br/>Seeing this movie, i think the franchise is going down the same path that the original Batman movie franchise (before Nolan revived it with Batman begins, and we all say thankya!) Shia's acting is the only saving grace of this movie, which should have been aptly titled ""Ressurection of Optimus Prime"" because that is what MOST of the movie is all about!!"
"jopapik6","4","1","6","9 November 2009"," Cliché, Hyped and Made for mainstream.
","The movie was bad but not bad enough (Thank God!). It was riddled with bad performances and bad dialogue. It was aimed at teenage audiences and people that lack the ability to distinguish a good and a bad movie. Shia Labeouf's screaming parts were a bit cliché as when any auto-bot was in danger he would go ""(insert auto-bot name)!!!!!!!!!!!!"".<br/><br/>There were clear plot holes which are not going to be mentioned due to spoilers. In brief, be wary when you watch this movie as you will not find it wildly exciting as ""The Rock"" was. Don't expect much from this Bay movie as it was not aimed at a more mature and sensible audience. It was also a bit stereotypical because of the personalities of the two auto-bots, Skids and that other robot whose name I forgot (blame the movie's mediocrity)."
"FourDaughters","4","1","6","26 October 2009"," Needless use of sexual humor
","Very rarely do I write a comment on these boards. However, I do use this site when choosing to see a movie. Therefore, from reading the many comments on this movie, I knew there was some off-color humor in the movie. While I'm an adult and can easily get past such humor and still appreciate a decent action movie, what really bothers me about this both Transformers movies is the audience that will inevitably be drawn to see these films. Transformers is a movie produced by Hasbro.<br/><br/>Hasbro is a toy company known mostly for making action figures. This means young boys will flock to see their favorite action figures fighting it out on the big screen. I grew up in the Transformer craze. I remember the cartoon series and the movies released in the 80s. Those did not need over-the-top sexually perverted humor. These newer movies would stand just fine without jokes and gags that involve a mother announcing her son has popped his cherry, a girl inadvertently being thrown face-down onto another man's crotch, a leg-humping ankle-biter robot, a dorm-room seduction, and on and on.<br/><br/>Friends of mine have a seven-year old son that just adores the Transformer movies. Should these movies put his parents in position to have to explain some of the things shown in these movies? Would you want your son repeating any of these things to their 2nd-grade teachers? Having such scenes in this movie detract from it...and for what reason? To get a cheap laugh to break up an intense action scene. Come on Hollywood, take a moment to consider your audience for such movies."
"danieljknight","4","1","6","26 October 2009"," Confusing and Cliché
","Dumb, painfully annoying, tainted by Darwinism, confusing, nonsensical, shallow. Sam's parents were unfunny and annoying as usual, though, sadly, were an accurate portrayal of how stupid many parents are. Figuring out who these ""prehistoric"" Decepticons were ruined the movie since I was always wondering. It was finally explained in a sloppy confusing way towards the end (a little late!). There was no explanation as to why they were hiding during the first movie. One of the ancient Decepticons, who seemed to be ""Shockwave"" (though was not named), tapped into a satellite. His whole role, respite looking very powerful, was controlling a satellite even though he had detachable transformers he could have used for that job. Also strange was that no one spoke to him.<br/><br/>Another confusing part was when one of the Decepticons was trying to acquire the larger of the fragments of the cube: when the soldiers showed up to investigate, it seemed like the shard was still in the case, at least to me, yet it got away with it apparently. A close up of the shard-holder should have been shown to make it clear it had been removed and for a dramatic effect.<br/><br/>Another stupid thing was when Megatron's leader, whatever his name was, oh yeah: Fallen One (really original eh?) tells the world something like, ""Now you can see we can destroy your cities""... DUH?: Wasn't that obvious from the first movie, or were there not enough buildings and cars blown up and broken through with giant robots from outer space Mr. Fallen One? And the destruction wasn't greater than what was in the first movie with the initial volley from the Fallen One. What would have matched his statement is the destruction of half a city at least, not seeing a few buildings fall down on a café and other not so spectacular things.<br/><br/>More confusion was when the grandpa Blackbird bot was brought back to life with the little shard Sam had, but why did it seem to get totally absorbed by the grandpa B. bot? It would have also been helped if someone, before going to search for these ancient transformers, said, ""They might not be in the same form as in these pictures (like the Model T Ford shown in one) since none was ever found, and instead one of them is in the form of a Blackbird jet. This Grandpa Blackbird, strangely, transported Sam and the others with him suddenly to another location (how!?). After they crashed, Blackbird / ""Skyfire"" gave them a bizarre explanation as to how he transported them, but his annoying accent made it too hard to understand him.<br/><br/>Yet another nutty thing was when the matrix was said to be a spiritual thing by one of the ancients in a vision of Sam, but why then did they say to stick it in Prime? And right after Sam screams and holds the Matrix up to stab it into Prime (and what got him to play drama queen like that instead of just getting on his hands and knees looking for a place to insert it? Obviously it was for dramatic effect though.) Another nutty part was when Megatron came back to life, upon doing so he went up through the water of course, but about as soon as he did that he is shown shooting up into space and instantly appearing... WHERE? It seems like he landed on the moon but instead it's some alien planet or moon, but how in the Hell in a few seconds did he end up there? So stupid.<br/><br/>It was a huge let down to see Devastator as vacuum beast rather than modeled after the one in the cartoon. It would have been much cooler for a giant lime-pastel green giant Decepticon engaged in battle and smashing away at the pyramid with his fist and shooting at it with his cannon, instead it was a a King Kong from outer space playing rip-the-bricks-with-my-bare-hands-and-vacuum-parasite-looking-mouth - that was more interesting ho hum effect than cool to me.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie they are dropped off near him by the Decepticons, but though the reason should have been to scare him into giving up the matrix, instead the Decepticons that dropped them off didn't do much at all it seemed, and there was so much chaos I can't even remember what happened to them when Bumble Bee showed up. Megatron should have been given the parents, then went up to Sam using them as bait/leverage. I guess he was too busy fighting.<br/><br/>Megan Fox was made into a sadistic-humored slut, and nutty. Near the beginning of the movie she's in an absurd super-slut pose, which could have won her Miss Slut Universe. And near the end of the movie she seemed to have gone bi-polar for a few seconds as she hid in a shack, starting when she saw Sam scuffle away in fear to another side of the shack.<br/><br/>And what was with the, ""Only a prime can defeat a prime"" nonsense? Why would a prime only be able to defeat another? Magic! And why didn't Optimus warn the humans that that was true? What an oversight.<br/><br/>Worst of all, was the cliché dodo advice given by Sam when Mikaela asked him how he knew that the magic fairy dust the matrix pointlessly turned into would resurrect Optimus. Sam said, ""Because I believe it."": Can you liberals and fake Christians stop telling the world that whatever you believe or want to do is the right thing to do? THAT ""JUST FOLLOW YOUR HEART"" is ever a good thing? Stop telling people to abandon reason! It was no different than how the elder Spock in Star Trek 2009 told his younger self to abandon logic. Ironically the horrible stupidity of Transformers 2 showed what a failure it is to just go with your heart (like greed) while leaving God and his commandments behind."
"beesfeet","5","1","6","25 October 2009"," For better or worse, you won't be able to take your eyes off it
","This isn't a case of ""If you liked the first film, you'll love the sequel."" It's not even excusable with ""It's a movie about alien robots fighting!"" Transformers 2 can only be summed up by: If you love summer blockbusters, you'll understand why this fails to fully live up to blockbuster standards.<br/><br/>Plot specifics are elsewhere, so let's just dig in. It's basically EVERYTHING in the first film multiplied by 10: The women are more glistening and bronze, the robots have more comically stereotypical accents, the stakes are higher, and the fight scenes are 10x more incomprehensible. Where the first film failed, this one fails. Where Transformers WOWED and raised the bar for CG epics, this film surpasses that standard.<br/><br/>The parents were funny in the first film, so they're used excessively (and given drugs) in this one. Megan Fox made all the males pitch tents in the cinema so she flashes her panties a little. Everything is in excess, and Michael Bay's thirst for destruction and sex and stereotyping knows no bounds. His sense of story (teleporting as a plot device) and lightening the tension with minority characters is boggling. His trademark scenes of bystanders or extremely minor characters getting more than two lines of dialog derails the film between action scenes. It's more distracting and goofy than silly and charming. Just picture a massive chase scene that follows two Decepticons chasing down Bumblebee...and then picture than ending with a butcher lamenting about his missing teeth. It plays like it reads.<br/><br/>Let's not discuss the twins. I'm not a super-sensitive racism whistle-blower. All you need to do is look at the first film and tell me which race is targeted as a caricatured comic relief. Yes, I'm aware of Bad Boys but that only reinforces my point. Moving on.<br/><br/>It's not all bad, folks. If you loved the action more than anything in Transformers, you'll be blown away here. Though occasionally hard to follow, the fight scenes are well choreographed and mesmerizing. The futile army reinforcements get redundant, and slow-motion transforming and running away from explosions are used in excess. But that's nitpicking. If there's any reason to see the film, it's for the action. You might get impatient just waiting for the next time a Decepticon and Autobot are in the same frame but if you can hold out for 5-10 minutes at a time, you'll be alright. There are about 6 huge set pieces here to satisfy you.<br/><br/>In any other movie I would say that's just way too much animated robot fighting. In Transformers 2, however, it's enough to match the lack in humanity.<br/><br/>The characters spend so much time shooting and running and yelling ""Look out!"" and spouting exposition that there's no time to care. Near the end, more characters are added to the climax to raise the tension and not to provide emotional depth. Deaths are not permanent, the drama is stale and truncated by over-the-top action and cleavage, and the stuffing of superficial personalities doesn't make a story more full. It makes it more lacking in emotion. When the world is at stake, aren't I expected to care about those little ants falling off of the aircraft carrier? Or the dots being stomped? Or the people who share the screen with the CGI? Where it lacks in cohesive and mindful storytelling, it matches in stunning visual effects work. Because I can't ignore one without the other, I'm giving this an even 5/10. For better or worse, you won't be able to take your eyes off of it."

They have names, but Speed Talk isn't my strength and I didn't catch the names. <br/><br/>It must be pointed out here that no pyramids were harmed in any way. What you see is CGI so no worries, eh?<br/><br/>Let's see, there is speed reading, speed dialing, speed dating, and now we have Speed Talking. The characters talked so fast I had no idea what they were saying or they spoke in such husky whispering voices that nothing came across with that as well. I was left with just watching CGI most of the time. And, since Michael Bay doesn't know when to stop these action scenes I drifted off to La La land several times. When I awoke, I realized I had not missed a thing, well, except for the story, of course. Some say there was one. Indeed?<br/><br/>If Michael Bay spent as much time with the story, dialogue and the acting performances, as he does with the CGI, he might have an Oscar on his hands. But, sadly the acting was wanting (except for Josh Duhamel, and Rainn Wilson. Both are pros and did good),and the story was lost in all the explosions/transformings, and I couldn't care about anything except when this was over. Two and one half hours of T2 is like 14-hrs of T2. Yes, it is still tedious, goofy and way too long as T1 was. Way too long. Did I mention that is was way too long? Oh.<br/><br/>As for the CGI, it was terrific and is the best I have ever seen. But, when it goes on for too long, it becomes old hat, boring, been there done that, and then it becomes quite annoying too. I am sure an Oscar has Michael Bay's name on it for Best Director or Special Effects. And, to be honest, it is deserved. Say what I will about T2, the directing of the CGI was pretty good. The CGI is terrific. There was just too much of it. Did I mention that T2 was way too long? Oh.<br/><br/>Now, I will go to bed every night and pray there is no Transformers 3.<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Well, for some unknown reason we see two dogs going at it in several scenes. Have no idea why. Not funny.

The Witlesswikies are back and more irritating than ever. Their behaviour is not that of a normal family dealing with a serious issue of national security, but rather escaped mental patients whose every utterance seems to be an attempt at humour.

I still don't get the robots, and why they do 75% of the things they do. I don't get how people can be in the Smithsonian one minute, and then crash out into a country airfield in the next.

"sobeit712","4","1","6","29 September 2009"," Michael Bay is a scam artist who ought to be tested for substance abuse
","I got the impression that Michael Bay did not actually do much directing in this movie. He was actually sitting at home and getting high the whole time while some computer geeks working feverishly on the special effects. There is no sign of a written script. Dialogues seems to be made up on the spot. Throw in some stock military footage of jet fighters and helicopters taking off and flying around, and some crazy editing of random shots of actors confused facial expression, running around in slow motion, yelling at each other in nonsensical gibberish, you have the movie! The editing and camera crew ought to be lined up and tested for substance abuse. No sober person could come up with this jumbo heap of mental diarrhea.<br/><br/>There is a strange consistency in Michael Bay's work. It has the look and feel of a US army's recruiting commercial. He is one of those current generation directors who make the whole movie looks like an ad campaign. The style works for ad campaign because the audience get an vague impression of what is going on but to find out what is really going on, they will have to go to the store and buy the product. It does not work for the movie because here, the movie IS the product. Michael Bay's character are also very loud and hyper. Come to think of it, I think they should send the whole film crew for drug testing, especially the director himself.<br/><br/>Also, I sense some cynical sarcasm in this sequel. It is so bad that it seems to be some sort of self deprecating parody. It is like Michael Bay is trying to paint a cartoon picture of himself that exaggerates all of his flaws. You know the kind of pictures in Mad Magazine. It is a pretty expensive joke consider the budget of this movie. But then again, like the title suggested, Michael probably scammed all those money away because this movie, though looks like very expensive on the surface, can probably be made with much less money consider 95% of the screen time are filled with computer generated effects. He could have out sourced the special effects to India or China, where mad 3d animation genius are working for peanuts. Hence my accusation of him being a scam artist.<br/><br/>My dad, being an old man from Asia, had never heard of Michael Bay before. He watched the movie for a bit and asked me if the movie was directed by a lunatic. He was very serious and sincere when he asked that question. I couldn't help and started laughing hysterically, while my poor dad looking at me, truly scared and concerned."
"aurorenwind","3","1","6","27 August 2009"," Transformers 2 (as a whole), Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox
","The movie was okay. I can't give it the whole ten stars for a number of reasons. Let's start at the beginning. Megatron was supposed to be dead. The allspark went directly into his spark and made it explode. So now he just gets brought to life due to a single shard? Though I don't believe the movie makers meant in any way for the movie to be seen as a racial stereotype movie in anyway, I admit they did a poor job on in portraying the actors as humans as a whole not as representatives of their own race. Shia LaBeouf did okay acting--got the main character part. Megan Fox.......how come all of the sudden all she is in the movie is a sex symbol? She doesn't do anything in the movie except show off herself. And where did all the make up come from? She looked better in the first movie when she wore little if not no make up at all. The fighting scenes were better in this movie, you could actually see which transformer was fighting who. Starscream--got a new voice-box. Megatron--brought back to life, got an upgrade, still got defeated by Optimus until you stabbed him in the back. Optimus--suddenly kicked ass, managing to fight not just one but three transformers at once, died, came back, got an upgrade, shot off half of Megabutt's face, and continued living as if you never died. And didn't Megatron blow your chest out when he impaled you on his saber? There was no way in heck could he have missed your spark if he stabbed you through AND shot a round out your chest. Jetfire--How the heck did you manage to grow a beard when you're a transformer? Heck, if the Transformers movies were actually based off the original Transformers series, Optimus and Megatron would have beards that would make Albus Dumbledore's look like Santa Clause's (Optimus and Megatron and bother their teams were in stasis lock for four million years). There are so many things can be seen as wrong in this movie and the makers obviously didn't work hard enough to fix it. The movie is mainly action, barely any plot, comedy that didn't need to be in there (Sam's mom becomes high on sugar, Sam's roommate being too much of a coward, and the twins just being there barely doing any fighting buts fighting each other. The movie is okay. Starwise, I would say three out of ten."

","My anticipation level for this film was high as I expected more robots providing the thrills and a darker tone as ""promised"" by director Michael Bay. The results were unsatisfying. While we got more robots like what he promised, he tends throw them around in the scenery to the point that we don't get to learn much about them, hear anything they have to say, or remember what their names were before he wipes them off-screen just to give more ""depth"" to these loud, lumbering idiots known as humans, particularly it's two leads Shia LeBouf and Megan Fox, who characters cute, if unbearable, teen romance subplot comes off to be more time-consuming rather than interesting considering the fact that Bay's films doesn't seem to have the time or place for any depth at all. If the human characters weren't enough, we have two dimwitted robots taking up the majority of the screen time from the much serious ones, you know the ones we never really got to know. The pros of this film are the visual effects, which are just as eye-catching as they well in the first film, the forest fight between Autobot Optimus Prime (outstanding voice-work by Peter Cullen), and Decepticons Megatron, Starscream and Grindor (in case anybody wants to know his name), which is something a die-hard Transformers fan would want in a film; the rocky relationship between Starscream and Megatron, which is a surprising throwback to the G1 cartoon and all other incarnations. The cons are, well, everything else. Robot characters again being thrown around left and right with no explanation of them and falling short of true fan boy's expectations, too much comedy this time around, but the jokes fall flat and the humor is just outrageous beyond meaning such as the gigantic Decepticon called Devastator being depicted with wrecking balls dangling from his crotch area like testicles despite the fact the none of the vehicles forming him are wrecking cranes; countless demeaning shots of Megan Fox bent over in whatever leathery gear she has on to make the frat boy demographic hoot and cheer like Married...with Children audience members (as a guy myself and a Transformers fan, I prefer action/effects first as it is called Transformers and sex appeal way, way later); the plot being a hodgepodge of relentless idiocy and inconsistencies; the unnecessary pyrotechnics displayed in this film, and the hype being built around certain characters that don't live up to their promise and the horrible addition of the Autobot twins who speak in profanity-ridden gangster jargon despite the fact that these characters are ""for the kids"" I know it's not meant to be brilliant considering the fact that it was based on a line of toys and that the original cartoon as just as flawed, that was my defense for the original film at least. I irritates me when people have to bring up the word ""Oscar material"" when it come to getting the film right and it an incredible movie going experience, to which the audience found in it; it's not about making it a ""Oscar"" film, it's about making it a better film."

","How to dissect a movie that has tarnished a grown man's childhood...<br/><br/>Michael Bay and his posse shamelessly copy and pasted this movie from others before it. The first part is straight out of 2001:A Space Odyssey, and if you ask me, just as boring and pointless. At least Kubrick was breaking new ground and should be given credit for such. Bay has proved to us that special effects are possible... but you already knew that.<br/><br/>The dialogue is painful, truly painful. I really couldn't understand the low brow humor with foul language. I am one of the few people that thought Tom Green's Freddy Got Fingered was funny and that movie is as low brow as it gets. Throwing a random swear word in here or there, or letting Jersey accented robots and dogs hump about was not just off color it was off target. This has nothing to do with transformers or the plot or reality for that matter.<br/><br/>The worst offenses: Mrs. Witwiki - a character that is so overdone you are surprised she hasn't publicly apologized for her actions - expect a golden raspberry for this one. College scenes - clearly shows that Michael Bay either A) never went to college B) was higher than GW Bush and doesn't remember it. There is nothing even remotely realistic about the aforementioned segments. The roommate that inexplicably has an Indian IT call center in his dorm room and the ridiculous secretary of defense get honorable mention for incredulous characters.<br/><br/>The movie was so fast that there really was no pace.. just a blur. You couldn't figure out who was who or what was even going on. I felt like I was 90% blind when the transformers were on screen because I couldn't see who they were, what they were doing, or what they even looked like other than a CGI blob.<br/><br/>Final words. There is no story, there is no shame, there is no reason to pay money to see this movie.<br/><br/>They should've used the 200 million to feed hungry children or something instead of giving it to convicted killer (of the transformers franchise) Michael Bay"

But the sequel A.K.A this movie, well I won't be that much excited to buy it, maybe on a bargain, but not at full price.<br/><br/>The truth is, as most people are saying, there wasn't any logical story in the movie...but to my disbelief, some like it only on the ""Robot Action"" which was such a shame from the first one. The ""Robot Action"" here was so much animation obvious that the animation/graphics of the first one was even better.<br/><br/>Second, the movie it self was so much of a waste of time and such a big headache. I mean, 2 HOURS AND 30 MINUTES....wtf? They should have at least dwindled an hour. But that just isn't the only mistake I'd bore you with and I won't bore you with others.<br/><br/>But let me add that I only gave my rating for 3 reasons, which is the locations were superb, no comment there. And of that surprising thing when the girl turns out to be one of the evil robots...that was well delighting. And because of shia's close-to-be-good performance.<br/><br/>A tip to those who haven't gotten the chance to go to the movie in the cinema, you're lucky, you can just download...don't waste money.<br/><br/>A tip to those willing to go watch the movie, don't...I dunno if you'll like it or not, but to my relevance, I could see everyone is disappointed when they come out of the 2h & 30min catastrophe!!

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the complete opposite of what a film is supposed to be and fails completely when it tries to appeal to all audiences. In fact it is like being served a dish that has everything undesirable: Racial stereotypes (which are a plenty here), confusing fight scenes, incoherent plot with numerous plot holes and a surprising amount of foul language that serves no purpose to the story (if you can call it a story) and soulless depictions of females, sugar-coated to perfection with the IQ of a dinosaur; Michael Bay to be precise. True, the film sometimes has it's moments but it is completely sidetracked with the most inane and just sheer stupid actions especially with Sam's parents and then later on his roommates or should I say complete refuses of society. Megan Fox is nothing more than window dressing but what can you expect when her character has nothing to do but pose like a Playboy magazine photo shoot. As for the robots, Starscream, Megatron, and The Fallen get more lines of dialog but this film commits the same sin as the first one did. None of the new robots get any chance to develop. This is due to the fact that Bay assumes everyone saw the first film so therefore he felt he didn't need to develop any of the other robots aside from Optimus Prime and Megatron. The first film wasn't nothing special, it had it's charms but after repeated viewings it gets worn out real fast like a new pair of shoes. Wow, that's ten bucks and 2 hours and 30 minutes of my life that I will never get back. Save your money and buy the old animated series and the Beast War series. Those ancient cartoons can run circles around this piece of trash.<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs."

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is the second movie in the Transformers series and this time the Autobots have formed an alliance with a secret division of the US military to weed out any remaining Decepticons after the destruction of the all spark at the end of the first film, but when Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) discovers a shard of it while moving to college, the race is on to find it and set about an ancient prophecy.<br/><br/>Now, I have to say that Revenge of the Fallen was a big letdown overall; don't get me wrong it was nice to see the return of Frank Welker as Soundwave, who nicely channels Dr. Claw from Inspector Gadget, a voice I thought I would never hear on the big screen and I loved Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime and the fight sequence in the forest with Prime taking on Megatron, Starscream and Grindor all at once is wonderful.<br/><br/>But even with all those positives, sadly I can't summon up any enthusiasm for this movie as a whole, as it was far too long by at least 45 minutes, I still wish that Welker had been given his rightful place as the voice of Megatron, there was no real through line to the story as it felt scattered and in the end, all it did was signify sound and fury and special effects and lots of money that ended up not having any heart or emotion to it, as even the movie's best moment comes undone by the end.<br/><br/>As for my final rating, I'm going to give this 2 out of 5 due to the positives above but apart from that, there wasn't much to this movie at all that warrants an immediate ticket purchase and after last year's The Dark Knight, this is a real shame."

","I went to see this movie because I was waiting an exciting adventure with great visuals, but since I knew that a sequel for the original Transformers was coming I released that the story would be as incoherent as the first movie, and I was right. In fact i felt slept during the projection. Yes, the movie includes amazing fx and action sequences but those are not exciting. And the reason is because the plot of the movie is one of the worst written I've ever seen in an American movie. First, why the hell there is a woman transformer, something like Terminator 3. Then, it is supposed that only a Prime can kill another Prime, but in the movie Optimus Prime is killed by a Decepticon... I think. And Finally I never understood why all the adventure finish in Egypt and why there is and 30 minute fight. I mean, is awesome but it has no reason. Also, something I hated since the first movie is the inclusion of the American army; for me it's like some kind of exaltation for joining American teens into the army. In conclusion, this a movie without a coherent plot that means the cancer of the American cinema..."
"starwarsadmirer90","10","1","6","29 June 2009"," Ignore The Critics & Arrogant Haters...
","First of all I have no idea where people get the idea that they know everything about movies and the movie business. They need to stick to their day time jobs and shut up.<br/><br/>I found this movie the most entertaining ACTION movie in years....probably since the first one. Notice how I typed ""ACTION"" and not ""MOVIE"" which can mean all kinds of genres.<br/><br/>I think people need to go back to school...or most likely..Kindergarten because saying a movie has no plot is ridiculous. The story makes sense to me and I am 18 years old. It's pretty sad when a grown adult says a film that is Produced and Directed by a COLLEGE GRADUATE with a BACHELORS DEGREE has no plot/story.<br/><br/>This movie has a wonderful moral, but one that needs to be found by the viewer. The relationship Sam has with his parents brought tears to my eyes because it happens all around the world. So the film has great emotion.<br/><br/>The comedy is hilarious. I've seen it 3 times (twice in IMAX) and everybody laughed at the parts they were suppose to. Michael Bay knows how to entertain.<br/><br/>The whole thing with the Twins being racist is the most arrogant thing I have ever heard. The Twins brought great comedy and they're not in there that long anyways so I can't understand why people are being so ""appalled"" by them. It's ridiculous.<br/><br/>The acting is better than most movies released in todays society. If someone says ""this movie has a lot more emotion this time around"" but says the acting is bad needs to be slapped. A movie having emotion with bad acting doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>I've read comments that the movie is just about explosions and beautiful girls. One comment on here says she is ""appalled"" because of it. Give me a break. What do you want to see in a movie...a bunch of ugly girls? No way. That is a real killer to the audience. Beautiful girls in films makes it more interesting and guys have the right to think they're sexy on the big screen and get excited. When you watch an action film like Transformers you need to walk out happy and satisfied, not mad and disgusted from watching ugly girls for 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>The score is beautiful. I bought it and it's inspiring. Linkin Park also did an amazing job at developing the theme for the movie with ""New Divide"", which I might add hit number one on Itunes in less than 24 hours. Buy the score, it is fantastic, especially if you're an artist.<br/><br/>As for the action...MIND BLOWING. This film contains the most epic action sequences ever done. Every time I watch the TV spots or even the movie I get pumped and feel like wrestling. That's how much adrenaline it pumps inside me. I am a filmmaker myself and after watching this It inspires me to aim higher in life and make my next film better. My favorite action scene is the first part of the movie in Shanghai. Watch it for yourself and you will see why...it feels and looks real, and that's what makes it exciting.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is one of my idols and this is a great example why. He knows how to entertain and notice how all of his films entertain people. He's the King of Action Movies and always will be. Box office does determine how good a movie is because if it's so bad why are people SPENDING MONEY to see it? I bet if you went around and interviewed 200 TEENAGERS (not adults from cavemen years) and asked them if they liked this...most will say ""yes."" If you like it, KEEP SEEING IT. Do not let anyone tell you otherwise.<br/><br/>And if you haven't seen it but are unsure, see it anyways, it's not going to kill you. Who knows, you might even enjoy it."

","I did not expect much from this movie. I did not expect a great plot, good dialog or either a recast of Mikaelas role. (don't like M.F.) All I wanted to see in TF2 was action, good cgi and more action and good cgi.<br/><br/>Sure, some things are ridiculous. You see autobots talking like pimped gangsters, a little decepticon trying to make love to Megan Foxs foot and you'll see a giant robots testicles. But these moments are few and far between. Though I think this stupidity could be easily avoided, I learned not to complain about that anymore. Maybe I'm just overrating the average audience.<br/><br/>Only once I would like to see a 200 million dollar movie with cgi as great as the one in TF2, where the producers consult some scientist to develop the behaviour of a highly evolved, light years ahead AI. And if they have a few thousand dollars left hire a good script writer. That would be really great but most likely not be happening in this millennium.<br/><br/>I'm rating this movie 9 out of 10 stars cause it's great ""Popcorn Kino"" and a 6,8 avg is totally underrated. I'm almost certain that TF2 is going for the Oscar for best visual effects.<br/><br/>If you don't care about dialog or storyline go and watch this movie. Or watch it for the amazing cgi like I did."

The story was good, the acting was great, the comedy was even better. Just forget all the crap you hear about racist robots, it's not racist it's just funny, thats all that matters. Above all though the special effects are superb, and once again Shia Labeouf provides us with a fantastic performance and is very well supported by Megan Fox.

It's Michael Bay at his best, giving us a film where you can switch your brain off and just enjoy as the world blows up and giant robots kick the crap out of each other. What more do you want from a summer blockbuster? <br/><br/>To summarise, if you loved the 1st your going to love this as well.

Those jokes are not meant to cause ""racial slurs"" or anything like that, its supposed to be funny. And to me it was. The jokes were kind of cheesy, but it was just enough so that it wasn't constant action. The story to this one is much more in-depth than the first, and that causes it to be longer. The action scenes are amazing. People will sit there and say, it was just a whole bunch of explosions and metal clanging, but wasn't that what the entire movie is about? It may be hard to understand who's who at times, but for the most part it is easy to tell whats going on. If you didn't want to see a movie with explosions, bombs, metal crunching, laser beams, and the occasional joke, then why would you watch this?"

","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has all the ingredients a perfect summer movie needs: action, humor, great casting, visual effects galore, thunderous sounds and impressive music (songs and score). This is what Michael Bay does best: loud and visual entertainment on screen. This is indeed the perfect summer action movie! 10 out of 10 ... without a doubt.<br/><br/>You may find plot holes in the script, you may find the acting of Megan Fox not equivalent to her sex appeal, you may even find some of the robots rather lame ... but hey: This is what you came to see! Why do you go to movies like this??? To experience a costume drama with tears and sobbing? Or maybe to escape reality for over two hours and have fun!!?? I go to the movies for different reasons and in this case I admit I simply love the Transformers movie franchise.<br/><br/>The effects are perfect, Jablonsky's score is powerful, the script is okay and funny (why do people bother to find plot holes here??) and all the actors do their job nicely. John Turturro is great, Shia as well, Megan ... okay, everyone serves their purpose. For that, Michael Bay deserves an honorary mention.<br/><br/>This film will absolutely not be one of the 10 films competing for Oscar's best films of the year. But still I rate it 10 because it delivers everything it ""promised"" :)<br/><br/>My rating system may confuse people but when I grade a movie, I use the system 1-10 and quite often I ask myself: hey, what if a great comedy is so funny that I'm laughing constantly... wouldn't it deserve 10 out of 10?? Yes, because it serves its purpose perfectly. Comparing maybe Atonement to Eurotrip would be hard but as a comedy I rated Eurotrip as a 9 or 10 ... but Atonement was 7 or 8. This may be confusing to some, but hopefully not all.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen deserves a 10."

","Im going to get this simple...<br/><br/>Bigger, loader, better, stronger and faster than the first Transformers. Great movie, Great special effects and fantastic action sequences.<br/><br/>For those on the internet & the world who are putting it down to a complete flop, check your brain & realize that this is a pure action cartoon/comic movie. This is not The Godfather, if u want that style of movie then go see a dramatic film and read a book. There also is some talk about all the mistakes in the film....I say what mistakes if you have nothing better to do but to analyze all the goofs then get a life. Watching the film i didn't focus on that at all, why watch a film & bad mouth it right away. If you think you can do any better... then make your own film, if you can find 180 million in your wallet. Michael Bay is the best action director out there & we should all be pleased he is doing this movie, otherwise this could of been like the Alien vs Predator series which should be erased from history.<br/><br/>I gave it 9/10 because it is the ultimate action movie & I'm glad it was 150 minutes, it had flown by & there was never a dull moment. For those who said the film was too long.... Im personally sick of going to watch a film that is too short, just over an hour long by the time you sit down & get into it you realize it is over, What a waste of money. Transformers 2 is worth the price of the tickets it is like Iron Man, Terminator, XMEN, Matrix and Die Hard rolled into one.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 is worth the wait, though my one complaint is The MUSIC and the lack of a good soundtrack... Im glad they used Linkin Park they rock. As well They should of used a lot heavy, faster and loader music, such as metal or hard rock bands e.g Metallica, Megadeth, Godsmack just to name a few in order to convey the massiveness & sheer size of the transformers & there strength in brutal fights.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 will do extremely well Globally. It will definitely be in the top ten grossing films of all time. My brother and I really enjoyed the movie & think it will be the biggest film this year. If you enjoyed the first one... then hold on to your seats & get ready to blow sky high. <br/><br/>It will make you wanting more... bring on Transformers 3 after Bad Boys 3 of course. Hopefully Michael Bay will do another bad boys in order to take a rest from Robots for a while."
"cheetor75-1","6","1","6","25 June 2009"," Wow....I am torn :SPOILERS:
","I am torn about this film. The first Transformers was a fantastic film. Not too sure what was going on here. The special effects were amazing. The story although rather rushed was not confusing. The bases is for The Fallen to get the Matrix of Leadership to activated the machine to destroy the Earth. Clear and simple.Other plot was for Sam to get the Matrix to bring Prime back to life. In the meantime Sam is being chased by the Decepticons to get the information in his head that was planted by a shard of the cube he found on his coat. The information that was planted in his head is a map to the location of the Matrix. So in essence the Decepticons need to find the Matrix for the Fallen. Now... Here is where the issues are with the film. Megan Fox cannot in any way, shape or form act but that's already known. She seemed to be modeling the whole dang movie.They didn't show enough Autobots (Sideswipe & Volt)in action. Random scenes of dogs and Robots humping could have ABSOLUTELY been left out. Slang talking twin robots as far fetched as it may be was absolutely funny to me but for some may either be offensive or get old after a while. Not a film for everyone. Lots of foul language. I can definitely see why people don't like it but I can also see why people love. I loved it but do agree that some things were unnecessary."

There were a few problems, but that doesn't matter, the first had it's problems too and it was still good. The story was just basic, and easy to follow, but good. I couldn't believe it but this one toped the first in CGI. It was amazing, this time around you could see the feelings in the robots eyes, all the emotions that they were having.

","Do you know what makes Transformers cool?<br/><br/>It's not explosions or action or cool voices or hot girls. I know this because I collected hundreds of the toys when I was a kid and the toys had NONE of those things.<br/><br/>In fact, the toys only had ONE thing: they could transform from robot to vehicle and back again. THAT is the essence of what made Transformers cool, and when I was a kid that sparked my imagination like nothing else that had come before it.<br/><br/>... Well, except ""Machine Men"" (or ""GoBots"" if you spring from the US), who actually pioneered the concept long before Hasbro stole it for Transformers.<br/><br/>Anyway, point is, they were cool because they transformed, and it was really revolutionary at the time. It gave my generation a whole new type of superhero that we felt were made specifically for us.<br/><br/>So it really was my childhood at stake when they screwed up the first Transformers. It manipulated me, lied to me, and made me feel dirty and ashamed, like the abusive pedo baby sitter I never had.<br/><br/>In part II, ILM hyped up their new high poly-count models, more realistic lighting and revamped algorithmic transformations -- but I actually laughed out loud when they grandly introduced the first transformation. An SUV rolls up and proceeds to transform into fan favorite robot Ironhide over a period of roughly 45 seconds.<br/><br/>Joints move, then move back, panels slide open then close again, things bend, twist and spin randomly. And all the while, the camera spins around him in a dizzying display of grandeur gone wrong.<br/><br/>I'm sure Bay thought he was creating spectacle, but he was really just making a spectacle of himself.<br/><br/>Then Ironhide stands up and busts out a bland British accent for some reason. They all have stupid accents. Some of them talk like clichéd Detroit gangstas, others seem to be doing a pretty convincing impression of Ruby Rhod from Fifth Element.<br/><br/>I guess this was Bay's attempt to make them recognizable and give them distinct personalities, but it's just another of a thousand choices that make the film annoying and childish.<br/><br/>Look, I feel bad, I really do. I know a lot of talented people put a lot of work into this movie. I appreciate all the reflections and textures and bump maps and complex polygons, I really do.<br/><br/>But it just doesn't excuse the chaotic direction, one dimensional characters and seemingly random plot line Michael Bay tried to pass off as entertainment.

","Being exactly like the first film except cruder, noisier, messier, and unfortunately LONGER, the mindless formula of: explosion, teen comedy, explosion, teen comedy, filler, explosion, filler, explosion, gets incredibly old quick, and by only the second film in the trilogy. This is due to director Micheal Bay's very narrow-minded and uninspired take on film-making. He's a simpleton in his work, with emphasis being put on SIMPLE, and the result is repetition of the first film in remarkably weaker and boring form because if it can't set itself apart from its own predecessor, then it can forget coming off as different as all the other ugly clusterf***s of CGI and fire that maraud among the theaters of America. That on top of the human characters being less human than the Transformers themselves, and more full-on racial stereotypes (which the Transformers are as well) with no identity or personality, and only there to commit heinous acts of juvenile humor, everything is taken to a higher and more insufferable extreme than in the first thanks to Micheal Bay's dimwitted logic of ""bigger automatically equals better"". And as if it wasn't hard enough to sit through as it is, it's even more difficult to make it through because of its ridiculous length. At its core, It's the same helping you'd come to expect despite all the steroids it's on in this sequel. With Revenge of the Fallen, Transformers has proved that it is the testosterone-soaked immaturity counterpart to the Twilight series of films.

","A YouTube video can have more meaning than this second epic film in director Michael Bay's Transformers series. This isn't even the worst of it. $200 million was spent on making Revenge Of The Fallen, and it made 836 million green ones at the box-office. I was wise enough to avoid seeing it in a movie theater, but I still felt ripped off after watching it at home. If this is the sort of film that passes as a big money-making machine these days then what is the world coming to? As an experience the film leaves one feeling tired, but it still has its good points. The CGI is often amazing though sometimes it takes effort to figure out which transformer you're looking at. Bay is, no doubt, a very good director of visuals. He can direct actors towards good performances too. I will say that Shia LaBeouf does a good job playing Sam Witwicky. The script hurts the film for sure, and makes it like a cartoon. Things could have been good if the dialogue was more thoughtful and if the pacing was better. As it stands Revenge Of The Fallen is somewhat of a mess. If only the juvenile humor had been kept out. Some people criticized Megan Fox, but I say why? It's not like the other actors in the film did much better. She's just there to represent a piece of good ole suburban American ass. At least SHE called Michael Bay Hitler. Yeah, the film could have been better (perhaps much better) if the Bayness wasn't so plentiful. So, for every impressive battle featuring the mighty Optimus Prime there is a lame attempt at humor featuring a small transformer with a machine gun for a penis. I don't recommend seeing Revenge Of The Fallen, but children will probably enjoy it."
"MLDinTN","4","1","7","1 June 2010"," it was mind numbing
","First, I want to say I really liked the first Transformers. It was much better than I expected and had a decent plot and was funny. The last hour of this movie was awful and silly. There was so much going on screen, you had know idea what was even going on. It was just special effects with machines fighting and the humans were after thoughts, just shown running through smoke and explosions. Megan Fox has nothing to do and it's good she won't be wasting her time in the third film. The parts I can say were good were in the beginning with Sam's parents, both at the house and when they go to his college. The soldiers brought back were pointless and the FBI agent is back. He's a butcher with a web site about aliens. And somehow this old robot transports them to Egypt??? Made no sense.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: The last hour was just one long boring action scene involving the robots. And this movie at 2 and 1/2 hours is too long. It just isn't good enough to recommend."

","Hello All.<br/><br/>This is basically a movie made for die hard transformers fans. Unfortunately the movie is just a b grade movie dressed with lots of cgi. The only good things are the robots. The acting is rubbish. Megan Fox cannot act for peanuts. Also Shia LaBeouf is an overrated actor and really couldn't hold this trash together. People leave your brain at the door cause the plot in this movie is very thin. I actually think that the whole cast needs to be sent back to acting lessons. Also writers need to spend a little time in purgatory to pay for this sins of wasting our time and money. Don't bother buying this on DVD just wait for it to come on free to air TV.<br/><br/>JNR"
"davideo-2","4","1","7","15 March 2010"," Everything you'll love if you thought the first was great...as below average as the last for everyone else
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>I'm used to describing the plot at this point in my reviews. But Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen has achieved the unthinkable...a 150 minute long film that had a plot that was both too vague to really make out and which I just could not care enough about to follow anyway. How it managed to sustain my attention for this long without me falling asleep I can only attribute to having a vague memory of the major disappointment that was the live action original, which was basically a load of noise and effects that I was able to take in just for the big let down that it was as a huge fan of the animated show as a kid. But, it got the right publicity (if not the greatest reviews) and these kinds of films always tend to do well at the box office with this behind them. And so, action auteur Michael Bay has gone and delivered a sequel that copies the formula of the first film exactly...and inherets all the same problems. What I'm basically saying is, if you're the undemanding kind that loved the first one, you'll have a great time. If you thought it fell below average, it'll be the same flashy but empty experience. And God help you if you hated the first one...<br/><br/>This sequel is every bit as soulless, empty and insincere as the first film, a good twenty minutes-to half an hour overlong to rub salt in the wounds. The writing, dialogue, story and acting (including Megan Fox delivering an appearance where her body and looks are clearly being sold more than her thesping) are all abysmal, and I think it would be hard even for an under twelve year old not to notice it at times. It's a none stop assault of great special effects and explosive action, culminating in a giant showdown at the Egyptian pyramids at the end that's technically amazing but just...all goes completely over your head. It'll do for a lot of movie goers nowadays but I'm glad I go for quality more than quantity. **"
"lat297","4","1","7","6 March 2010"," What a shameful waste of money
","This was a remarkable film, in that it reached truly unparalleled levels of awfulness.<br/><br/>Where to start? Is it the very poor dialogue, the lack of character building, the terrible plot that had more holes than I can possibly list here, or the fact that they somehow managed to string it out for nearly 2.5 hours? I'll pick on one aspect, to illustrate how poor this movie is in every regard: the complete lack of research that went into the film. Somehow our lead characters, who lacked any kind of depth whatsoever and are therefore completely interchangeable, so I won't bother using their character names, travelled through Egypt extensively, somehow managing to drive from the Pyramids of Giza (in Egypt) to Petra (in Jordan) and back again in an afternoon; then when back at the Pyramids of Giza, they popped to Karnak in the south of Egypt for five minutes before returning to the Pyramids again a frame later. <br/><br/>Egypt,according to Michael Bay, is about ten kilometres wide.<br/><br/>As for the pyramids themselves, how you are able to see Khafre's pyramid in the background, when the lead character is supposed to be on Khafre's pyramid at the time, is completely beyond me.<br/><br/>How Michael Bay thought he could get away with using Egypt as a setting for at least a third of the film, without bothering to actually go there and see what it looked like, is completely beyond me. But get away with it he did, apparently.<br/><br/>**** UPDATE: Since writing this, I have discovered that not only did Michael Bay film in Egypt, but the Director of the Egyptian Museum of Antiquities was instrumental in making it possible. Very few American movies get to film on set in Egypt. I can only hope that this shows what is really important to Zahi Hawass, given the eventual treatment of the Pyramids in this film: In Egypt, the almighty dollar rules supreme. ****<br/><br/>This is a kid's movie, made for older men simply because of the gratuitous flaunting of the female lead's body throughout.<br/><br/>In summary: if you still own Transformers toys, you'll love this. If you have anything better to do for 2.5 hours of your life, you should avoid this."

","I've never really been a fan of transformers. But when I rented out this movie I was at least expecting 90+ minutes of moderate sci-fi entertainment. Unfortunately I was severely disappointed. The film is a very bad, very sad military special effects feast. It has no decent story, no decent characters, and lacks anyone the viewer can identify with. Even the few attempts at humor left a sick feeling in my stomach. That the plot doesn't make sense might have been excused if the film were enjoyable. However it is little more than a very expensive and distastefully cheesy waste of film. After painfully watching it to the end I was tempted to burn the DVD instead of returning it."

","I went in knowing this would be just like the first, but better. There are many things I liked and only some I didn't.<br/><br/>As for story, it was MUCH more evenly paced than the first, and I actually liked the plot. IT INVOLVES THE MATRIX OF LEADERSHIP! YAY! Optimus and Sam dying were really jaw-droppers, in fact, I heard some people shout ""NO!"" in the theater. People were really struck when Sam died, they were like ""WOAH!"". I couldn't tell, but I think he was either stabbed or shot. Not to give away the ending, but I didn't feel it was anticlimactic.<br/><br/>As for characters, they were, again, much better. Wheelie was HILARIOUS and may have been the funniest there, although him saying ""Fric*ing all the time got kinda old and probably added to the rating. Sam's roommate was funny, and his reaction when Mikaela landed on him after Jetfire warped them to Egypt was priceless! Speaking of Sam and Mikaela, their relationship was much more fleshed out in this one, and isn't like ""Some nerd meets some hot girl and they fall in love"". Many times Mikaela is about to brake up with Sam, and it really adds to the human subplot.<br/><br/>The pretender was great as well, they picked a really pretty girl to play her human form, and it really seemed to work. When that tentacle came out from under her dress, I was like ""Um, this isn't good for Sam"". In fact, she is what made all the ""SEXUAL SITUATIONS"".<br/><br/>Back to robots, the twins were better then people made the out to be. I liked how they spoke Gangsta and were always clumsy, the theater kept laughing at them. I'm not going to give much away about Devastator, but let me just say, him combining WAS AWESOME!"

","It was a stroke of genius to invent a toy which, with a few manipulations, changed from a vehicle of some kind into a robot - a simple concept, if complex in the engineering. Creating an animated series as a running commercial for the toys was also brilliant although, like all such things, the fad ran its course and both toys and TV series were relegated to the fond remembrances of ex-small boys. However, nostalgia is big business, hence the reappearance of the Transformers in real-life (well, high quality CGI) in 2007's big screen Transformers movie.<br/><br/>Let's be clear - if you thought the first movie was rubbish, there's nothing in Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen which is going to change your mind.<br/><br/>I happened to quite like it, and so did lots of others because it enjoyed considerable box office success: so much so that the makers have set out to replicate that success in this sequel.<br/><br/>Let me look at the common features of both movies. There is no story, of course, only backstory (viz. the ongoing interstellar war between two groups of shape-changing robots, the good Autobots and the evil Decepticon - this scenario was an adequate hook on which to hang an episodic animated series), but interposing an engaging couple of humans is a great help. Shia LaBoeuf as beleaguered everyman Sam Witwicky is ideal for audience identification, and Megan Fox as the sinuous Mikaela is ideal eye-candy for slavering male fanboys (for, make no mistake, these movies aren't aimed at women). And it was a masterstroke to bring in Peter Cullen's excellent voice characterisation of Optimus Prime - magisterial but compassionate - to bridge from the TV series to the movies. Sam's parents play non-essential but entertaining roles in both movies (particularly Julie White as Mom) and John Turturro reprises his role, albeit more sympathetically in the sequel (his role as establishment a-hole is taken by a newly appointed government something-or-other). The script is blessed with humour, there's lots of action, and the Transformers themselves are visual marvels.<br/><br/>Now let me look at what has been changed for this sequel. Er, nothing. No, that's not strictly fair - the big change is that there is far more - FAR - more - of everything, even to the extent of introducing a second, and unnecessary, beleaguered everyman. There are more Transformers, more explosions, more running away, and that's where the problem lies - when the film concentrates on Sam's problems, or on the interactions between the Transformers as characters, it's fine.<br/><br/>It's when the action takes over that the flaws of the first movie become compounded. Number one is that the action is so frenzied, and the camera-work (as is the fashion these days) is so verite that it's often difficult to tell what's going on - use a tripod sometimes, folks! Number two is that it is often difficult to tell which Transformer is which, particularly with the Decepticons, and if you don't know who is fighting, how can you care about the outcome. And the third is the overkill factor - the lesson of Matrix 3, that interminable CGI action sequences lose the audience's engagement after a while - seems to have passed Michael Bay by. Transformers 2 could have been at least half an hour shorter, most of it trimmed from the final action sequence.<br/><br/>The ongoing potential subplot about Mikaela's Dad's shady past is touched on and then passed over.<br/><br/>These flaws are a pity, because there is much to enjoy about the movie, particularly the sequence about the hot chick at college who unaccountably takes a shine to Sam. I could have done without the leg-humping gags, and half an hour of ear-pounding action, but otherwise I enjoyed it."

","This is the first review I have ever written on IMDb, normally I wouldn't, but after watching this film and seeing that it had a lot of 10-star reviews I felt compelled to comment.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this film was completely ruined for me by the atrocious attempt at 'humour'. It was not funny, it was immature and annoying, the characters who were there supposedly to provide comic relief were just annoying. Maybe if you're 8 years old you'd find it amusing, but it completely spoiled the film for me. In fact, the dialogue in general was bad, very very very bad. The story was OK I guess but it seemed a bit all over the place at times.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't great, I love Shia and I think he was trying but he didn't really have a lot to work with in this film. Megan Fox was poor, the room-mate guy was awful, everyone else was mediocre. <br/><br/>There were also a lot of unnecessary scenes in the film and pointless elements to the story. Seriously, who cares about Sam and Michaela's romance? There was zero chemistry between them anyway. And any scenes featuring his parents were irritating and pointless.<br/><br/>Of course, the special effects and action were really impressive, but towards the end I found myself losing interest because the rest of the film was just so terrible, and to be honest, the action isn't even frequent enough to redeem it in an way.<br/><br/>I could go on but I'll keep this short as I want people to read this and know some of the reasons why this film is bad before potentially wasting their time watching it. I really wanted to like it because I enjoyed the first one but it was just crap."

The humor is a race for the bottom (like cheap standing comedy). College life is presented in an incredibly immature fashion. The scenes in Egypt, Jordan and Washington are designed for people with zero knowledge of geography (if you have a minimum of knowledge you would be utterly confused).

","I hadn't watched the first Transformers film when I saw this at the cinema, so I really wasn't sure what to expect, but I really hated what I saw.<br/><br/>For starters, I don't understand why the film had to be two-and-a-half hours in length. The story was hardly brimming with development, so really for that to make sense it had to either have some good action scenes, some funny moments or some character development. It had none.<br/><br/>Now, the action scenes are exactly what Transformers should be good at, and I must admit that first sequence actually got my hopes up in this department. It was flashy and it looked cool, but that was the only scene that did. After that, all the fights consisted of metal lumps clunking together, and if I wanted to see that I'd go home and hit to pieces of cutlery against each other for a few minutes.<br/><br/>Funny moments. Well, they made attempts to do this, and I couldn't call them boring. Though I would say all their attempts at humour actively offended me. Not in a hurt-feelings way, but just because they were so bad. Some jokes just didn't make sense, like the 'swine flu' thing. Clearly that was thrown in at the last minute, and I just don't understand why.<br/><br/>And then there's the twins. It's too easy to pick on them, when I've seen that even the most ardent defenders of this film sheepishly admit that they were a horrible, horrible part of the movie. It is very difficult to enjoy a film though, when you have those rolling hunks of half-baked sassy lines and clunky ""laugh-at-me"" delivery.<br/><br/>The characters I didn't end up caring less about. None of them showed any personality. I couldn't really pick a strength or fault in any of their personas, because they don't have one. I'm struggling to think of anything to say about them because they're just so bland and predictable.<br/><br/>For the most part, this film is just no interesting, and the only scenes that really pulled me out of a state of boredom were just there to really annoy me. I could go into great detail about the university lecture bit, but it would be pure pedantry on my part when it's just easier to say that this movie is awful."

","Ultimately, Revenge of the Fallen is the most highly budgeted bad movie of all time. Think of all the cliché things that are involved in Michael Bay movies, multiply that by 10, put in some giant robots and you have Transformers 2. Sadly enough, a fair number of high budget movies are unoriginal in plot and story development, but in one way or another a good portion of them redeem themselves with some level of entertainment. Revenge of the Fallen fails to deliver the entertainment because the plot is uncohesive and haphazard. The only redeeming quality might be the amazing special effects but they are overshadowed by the worst flowing story of all time. Michael Bay manages to take the concept of movie making, defiles it, and gets away with it by using millions of dollars along with the sad fact that the average movie goer is not terribly demanding and is relatively easy to please. The guys at www.wednesdayisforcomics.com do a good job of breaking this down on their latest podcast regarding bad movies. Why is the storyline so haphazard you ask? It comes down to the way the movie was filmed. A large number of scenes were filmed with no idea on how they would fit inside the script. Screenwriters were hired after the fact to fit in the gaps and try and blend these scenes into the movie. Needless to say this style of filmmaking makes for a distorted storyline and a flow that is forced."

","Tranformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen is the 2009 follow up to the Massive smash, minor critical hit is nothing short of dull, overly plotted, over crowed and most of all dumb. The problem with this film is that it tries way too hard to be funny. All those little gags from the twin autobots, and weak dialogue weren't funny or great Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is nothing short of a good idea gone bad, Michael Bay tries and fails to bring up the value of the sequel to his adequate adaption of the popular kids show and toy line. But there are three main reasons that it failed. 1.) It's dull, overlong and it doesn't follow any strict set of rules or even a coherent plot for that matter. 2.) It's terrible and bland acting on most part of the cast brings down the high production values of this film. But to no avail they don't succeed very well. 3.) It's just a plain, old good car with bad parts. All in all this film could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is dumb fun, it uses flashy and stylish CGI rock'em sock'em robot fights, an alluring female lead and bad jokes to entertain. But it fails miserable in it's attempt to be good and plausible entertainment. It drags along for way too long and is very boring at times. But on the bright side it is great fun and a good thrill ride to enjoy. But nothing more. All in all it was a shallow attempt at making a franchise that has been around for more than 30 years and turns it into a bad film. All in all Revenge of the Fallen is an A-Bomb.<br/><br/>The truth about this Transformers movie is that it's 147 painful minutes of thoughtless special effects action. Director Michael Bay and producer Steven Spielberg comes to the table with very little plot, themes, complex sentences, and characterization to speak of. But for the targeted audience, teens and tweens, that's alright. So if you're ready for some reckless violence, rather good reckless violence I might add, then go check out Transformers this weekend. Hell, I'd even go during your regular Sunday nap time, and just take one somewhere in the boundless middle of the movie. It was as bad as people made it out to be. WOW"
"Rodrigo_Amaro","1","1","9","30 August 2010"," I can't believe I lost an EMMY'S night for this!
","What a terrible mess this film was for me and for many people also. I mean what these producers (including Mr. Spielberg) were thinking? What Michael Bay was thinking? Too much money on their hands and the result was an excessive, endless, distractive and horrible movie? But I won't point my fingers only to these guys, I must say something to other people too. The blame of this excuse for a movie is on the shoulders of the two writers of this and Columbia Pictures/Sony for allowing a useless form of cinematic experience to been brought on screen. <br/><br/>Is it really that bad? YES it is! I watched this thing for the whole time which means almost three hours of projection and the movie starts to become a boring and endless experience at 15 minutes. But I went ahead, almost crying for missing the EMMY'S (although I've seen some parts of the show and I could honestly say that it was a very good show). When Linkin Park song appeared and the credits rolled I was devastated. And along with that a annoying headache appeared and bothered me for some time. <br/><br/>Reducing the plot: Two great team of Robots fights each other and the arena for this fight is our planet and our fate is on the hands of....Sam (Shia LaBeouf) who has in his pocket a fragment of one of these robots, and this fragment shows some secrets. Gathered with incredible and miraculous special effects there's a group of actors from the first (and excellent) film: Josh Duhamel, Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro, Kevin Dunn and Megan Fox (which is here only for the purpose of horny teenagers seeing her bending over a car; she barely has one decent dialog here). Hugo Weaving also makes the dubbing of one of the robots. And adding new elements and actors to the franchise there's a wasted performance of Rainn Wilson, Ramon Rodriguez (the movie could be better without him) and John Benjamin Hickey, who plays a hysterical bureaucrat, and has the worst performance in this film even beating Jon Voight for a similar role in the first film.<br/><br/>There's no plot here. I mean, two Robots hating each other and their fight is going to be here just because someone has a little thing in the pocket? Thousands of plot holes and inconsistencies; thousands of unfunny and annoying jokes; overlong battles; nothing was interesting, and when I say nothing it really means nothing. The trailers offered a dark, sinister and interesting movie to watch, but the real deal is a waste of money, waste of time, waste of actors, waste of director and waste of health (for me who end up who with a headache, perhaps other person might had some nausea). <br/><br/>""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is a disaster out of salvation. One time I was the biggest defender of Michael Bay's work, even when people called the 1st ""Transformers"" of being the worst film ever. Everything he directed I truly enjoyed but after this one it is possible that I might not want to watch his future releases. But I know that the fault lies in the writers because nothing could be made of so great or interesting here. The loads of comedy thrown in this gigantic wreck is incredibly shocking, so shocking that you wonder if a robot wrote this movie and the writers is just names of a front like the ones used in the McCarthism.<br/><br/>It's incomprehensible how people liked this incomprehensible adventure and made these the 23rd highest grossing film of all time. I'm writing these because I was there, I watched, I suffered through the whole thing and as a advice coming from the one who was in the battlefield of trying to understand if this was good or not I'll say to you: If you have the guts go for it, take all the necessary risks. But don't say I didn't told you so. It is really that bad. For the indecisive people trust me, you can skip this one easily like a root canal treatment. And I've never been in one! Awful! 1/10"
"wozser666","5","1","9","3 August 2010"," Far far far too many clichés
","What I thought whilst watching this film is it's a great kids film. It has silly characters, toilet humour, some classic old school racial stereotypes (kids love over the top black guys and what's funnier than having 2 robots be over the top black guys) and all the different character types you could expect from an action movie.<br/><br/>I kept thinking that this movie is perfect for 8 - 14 year olds and would be OK for an adult accompanying them to watch also in the knowledge they're watching a nice kids action movie. The only problem is it isn't for that age group. There's some drug and sex references which make it more appropriate for adults rather than young kids and this is where I think the movie falls down.<br/><br/>If you're going to make the movie aimed at older teenagers and adults you should really make the dialogue a little bit less immature. I don't mean it has to have a serious message or be deep and meaningful. Certainly not. Look at any decent action movie and the script is going to have some witty one liners. Some stupid over the top bad guys and all that and that's part of the enjoyment of it all.<br/><br/>I felt with this movie that it was written by a teenage boy. It just missed the mark. Michael Bay just seems very immature. Compare this movie to some other recent action movies like the latest die hard and you'll see that they flow better and the dialogue isn't quite as tween like. <br/><br/>A few of the things that made me really dislike this movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>Parts that tried to pull the heart strings when you really don't give a flying crap about the characters. Especially all the romance scenes which were unnecessary.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole college thing with his Mum. I won't say what exactly happens but it's just painful to watch.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Megan Fox. She's too hot and can't act. It's distracting when you're trying to get in to the action and this poster girl looks like she was superimposed on to the scenes never a hair out of place.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The blowtorch scene, not gonna say what it was but if it had of been the other way round it would have been considered pretty sick.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Having 2 dumb robots voiced in a over the top black guy way waving round guns and being a bit stupid and gangsta was a bit clichéd and pretty offensive.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>All the supporting characters. They just seemed like a giant pile of generic gash.</li></ul><br/><br/>On the plus side the action and CGI was very impressive and the story idea itself was perfectly reasonable.<br/><br/>I just think if they could have got in a few people in for cliché and continuity control it would have been a better film. When you're spending millions and millions on actors and CGI you can really afford for some non retarded people to look over the script and pick it apart a bit."

A big blockbuster with endless green screen.<br/><br/>Then there's the hype surrounding this movie. So many people complain about and the predecessor and yet the publicity machine is able to completely ignore this and steam roller ahead as though its another 'Gone With the Wind'. Anyone who thinks this movie is better than 'Gone With the Wind' should be banned from the cinema.<br/><br/>In England there's a film reviewer called Mark Kermode his reviews are available and he has plenty to sat about Michael Bay and the way he makes films. None of it good.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is either rotten or offencive. I found the use of Egyptian scenes offencive as it seemed like the exploitation of national monuments of great importance to try to give legitimacy to one of the worst films ever made. Its one of the worst as it shows such a waste of technical skills by a director who mysteriously gets commissioned, a script writer who appears to have the toys writing the script.<br/><br/>A better film would be explaining how Megan Fox would be with someone like Shia!"

There's only so much torture I can take.<br/><br/>One of the most puzzling things to me is who was this movie aimed at? The plot was moronic, contradictory, and had massive continuity errors. The alleged humour infantile in the extreme.

I left the cinema with no other thought than that I should get home as quickly as possible to consume the pain killers sitting in my medicine cabinet. <br/><br/>For two and half hours, this wretchedly expensive technicolour yawn had jangled my nerves, eroded my soul and compromised my intelligence to such a degree, that I honestly thought my brain had engaged in a fight to the death with my skull. <br/><br/>For the record, I actually enjoyed Bay's first outing for the shape-shifting toy-range, and whilst I wasn't exactly waiting with baited metal & steel breath for their return to the big screen, I was thinking this sequel would at least equal the young-dumb-full-of-fun schtick of the original. Wrong.Wrong.Wrong. <br/><br/>The biggest sin committed in this bloated behemoth ( apart from the rotten racial stereotypes, rotten Mum character, rotten 'pirate' Transformer (WTF?!), rotten CGI 'action' and rotten way in which Bay cuts up every single scene into a million pieces yet still manages to mangle the pace) is that the real Transformers - Optimus Prime and the gang - are reduced to cameo bit-parts in their own movie! Again, WTF?! <br/><br/>Seriously Mr Bay - what were you thinking? I reckon you thought: ""Yeah, I know this committee-written garbage has been assembled by a bunch of soulless greed-Meister's , but hey! - im a soulless greedmeister too, and they're paying me zillions to show up and direct it...so what the hell?!"" <br/><br/>Bay and the producers of this skyscraper stinker, should be forced to watch their 'masterpiece' on an eternal loop until they succumb to the eternal promise of never making another Transformers sequel and never going near a movie/TV studio or piece of film making equipment ever again.

It's mind-boggling really, how some of the same people that created the first Transformers, that I liked, could actually 'create' something this pathetic. Where the first movie had a decent storyline, good character development, a good pace and great action, they didn't even bother to put any thought into this one. Just throw in some robots, hot chicks and why not, let's try and be funny with a big dose of mindless college humor. But really mindless: it really feels like they just made a list of the usual ingredients that do well in these college movies - some hot chicks, horny guys, embarrassing situations, drugs, nerds, some more hot chicks, and than just poured it in there, just at random, whatever. The target audience loves this stuff, so let's give it to them. Seriously, it's an insult. The characters are reduced to simpletons, sacrificed to the urge to make this a comedy. 'Once they start laughing, they will just swallow the action without asking themselves why or how' is what they must have thought. Well, I did not laugh, nor did I swallow any of the action, that is actually too fast, nauseating at times, to be enjoyed (if you would be able to shut off your brain in the first place).

For starters, it's two and a half hours! They are pushing epic drama movie time with that, and this was NOT an epic drama. Secondly, there was less character development or substance than in the first one, which detaches the audience from the story. It's mind-numbing fighting, explosions, and Baywatch slow-mo running scenes. Ladies, send your man to see this movie with the boys.

","Well, what can I say about Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, that isn't totally negative. I know, I split this review into two parts...so here goes!<br/><br/>WHAT WORKED: Great visual/special effects for starters and lots of action, fighting robots, big guns and explosions. A lot of the set pieces were very good and kept me entertained. Performances wise, Shia LaBeouf does well as the kid who holds the key the world ...again. Good support from John Turturro, who was actually quite funny and the rest just followed suit, with the exception of one...who I'll mention in a bit. Best thing about this movie is Optimus Prime. I thought he was great in every scene. Not only would the Autobots be lost without him, but they'd also be quite useless. Prime exhibited all the qualities a leader should have in the midst of battle. And to be honest with you, that really spoke out to me. Megatron and Starscream were also great and I hope both characters are included in the next movie.<br/><br/>WHAT DIDN'T WORK:<br/><br/>The humour was horrible. It was a mixture Family Guy and Three Stooges slapstick. The Ghetto talk whatever you call it robots were annoying, as was Sam's Mum and Dad, who made so many perverse jokes I thought I was watching a different movie. Megatron should've killed them when he had the chance. The main bad guy the Fallen was useless and I never really believed that he was more powerful than Megatron. Tyrese and Josh Duhamel were passengers in this movie, I really didn't care if they lived or died. Crappy climax from a slow, tedious build up, plus Michael Bay is a horrible director and should go back making music videos. His direction is predictable and cheesy at best, the Rock and first Transformers movie are the best films his made by far. Finally, we have Megan Fox, who is a fine figure of a woman but has the acting ability of a cucumber. Her relationship with Sam isn't believable, so there's no real chemistry between the two. That and the fact she poses in literally every scene she's in. She's better off posing on the cover of Sports Illustrated or Maxim or one of those magazines.<br/><br/>All in all, I knew this movie in particular would a bit of a let down. Mainly because first movie was really good and the sequel had to be something really special to top it. Sadly it failed and I for one hope they have a different director at the helm. Because Transformers needs to have a darker edge to it (stuff the kids) and Michael Bay isn't the man to do that.<br/><br/>Definitely worthy of a release, but would I buy the Blu Ray or DVD? And how many times could I watch this movie?"

","Let me just start off saying that I loved the first Transformers movie. The action, acting and comedic timing were all perfect. Even the story was good. This is probably why Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen breaks my heart. The 5 stars I give this movie go ONLY towards the Autobots and Decepticons and their amazing fights and action sequences. The real problem with this movie is with the humans. Cut the humans out and you have a good action movie. What's wrong with the humans? Let me count the ways: 1.) Sam's parents (primarily his mother) are so damn annoying. I really was about to shut the movie off when they go to drop Sam off at college. 2.) Speaking of college, what college is Sam going to? ""We're ALL Hot People College?"" Where are all the ugly chicks wearing pajamas that were in my classes? Of course I wouldn't mind attending college that had nothing but hot people in it but this college was only one that Michael Bay could dream up. 3.) Sam is an idiot. Who wouldn't want to take their robot car to college? 4.) Megan Fox was...well, Megan Fox. I'm sorry, how did she smuggle a mini Decepticon onto a plane? 5.) Sam's college roommate....omg so annoying and not funny. Even though it was a PG-13 movie, I was BEGGING to see this guy blown away into little fleshy red bits. 6.) John Turturo wasn't funny. 7.) Not humans, but we all could have done without the twin stereotypical racial robots. <br/><br/>Overall, Michael Bay tried to do TOO much. He tried too hard to make it funny whereas it just came naturally in the first one. Everything in this movie fails except for the CGI."

","The 2009 film ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" is considered to be the worst film of that year, and, if not, of all time. This film represents everything that is wrong with the film industry today. The logic of the plot and characters makes little to no sense, as well as takes the classic characters from the source material and takes away what made them memorable. As expected, infamous director Michael Bay replaces character and story for more unnecessary action. The action sequences themselves prove to be cluttered and messy, rendering the audience unable to differentiate one character from another, but instead it appears as a cluttered mess of metallic gray moving parts on screen. Character development is nearly non-existent and the few examples we do get, never add up to anything, nor are they resolved are resolved in the end. The human characters only serve as either eye candy or a punch line to a poorly written joke. The jokes, as well, are juvenile and unnecessary at times, some of which are even at random, in a pathetic attempt to get a cheap laugh out of the audience. Most importantly, they are not funny in the least; they serve only to create an awkward silence lacking any humor whatsoever. The actors in the movie are either overacting beyond comprehension or just blandly read their lines to collect their paycheck at the end of the day. This movie not only proves the faults of the filmmakers involved in this project, but also the current flaws with of the today's film industry as a whole."

"jboothmillard","3","2","53","21 January 2010"," Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
","Transformers was a big smash hit in the cinemas with fantastic special effects from producer Steven Spielberg and Razzie winning director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Armageddon), the same can't be said for this follow up. Basically Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) has just started at college, but he is aware that the robots in disguise are still living amongst the humans, while Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) is with the US forces fighting against the Decepticon threat. This time the evil robots want to get Sam and access his mind where information is imprinted which could mean the end of the world, with the help of a fragile object he has. This object would be inserted into an alien machine hidden in Egypt for centuries, which when activated could blow out the sun. So with the help of Bumblebee and the rest of the Autobots, Sam and Mikaela Banes (Razzie nominated Megan Fox) first have to bring Optimus back to life when he is killed by the revived Megatron (Hugo Weaving), and then save the world. Also starring Josh Duhamel as Major Lennox, Tyrese Gibson as USAF Master Sergeant Epps, John Turturro as Simmons, Kevin Dunn as Ron Witwicky, Razzie nominated Julie White as Judy Witwicky, John Benjamin Hickey as Galloway, Ramon Rodriguez as Leo Spitz, Isabel Lucas as Alice, Rainn Wilson as Professor Colan, Matthew Marsden as Special Air Service Forces and Robert Foxworth as Ratchet. While the special effects are still very well done, the story hasn't been fully thought out, from those two annoying jive talking robots to the weird pacing and some cheesy dialogue, this just isn't as good as the first one. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound, and it won the Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and it was nominated for Worst Screen Couple for LaBeouf & Either Fox or Any Transformer and Worst Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel.

The existence of the Earth is at stake.<br/><br/>I like to watch the young actor Shia LaBeouf who is back as Sam Witwicky. He has a very cool car, a yellow Camaro, which is actually one of the Earth-friendly Transformers.

I hope all her parts are natural, not man-made, otherwise she would just be another type of Transformer!<br/><br/>The movie runs a bit too long, maybe even a lot too long, but on the whole I enjoyed watching it.

"fernandoschiavi","5","0","2","25 May 2020"," It is only the pyrotechnic and digital spectacle that makes this second endeavor of the franchise in cinemas something worthwhile
","Two years after the battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) faces the anxiety of entering college. This means that he will have to live separately from his parents, Judy (Julie White) and Ron (Kevin Dunn), leave his girlfriend Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox) and explain the situation to his friend and protector Bumblebee, as he intends to take a normal life from now on. At the same time, the government deactivates Sector 7, resulting in the dismissal of Agent Simmons (John Turturro). In its place is created NEST, an agency led by Captain Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sergeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson), who works in conjunction with the Autobots. However, NEST faces resistance from Theodore Galloway (John Benjamin Hickey), the national security consultant, who considers it superfluous.<br/><br/>The structure of the script remains similar to the formula that made the first a great success, maintaining the humor and action, however the great defect of ""Revenge of the Defeated"" is in its total exaggeration and imbalance in the narrative. The plot starts back in time (12,000 BC) to justify the existence of robots in the early days of humanity and then go back to the present day and talk about the partnership between Autobots and humans in the fight against the Decepticons. As it should be, there is the childish love between boyfriends Sam (Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela (Megan Fox), and also the eternal ability to save the world from the American armed forces. And add robots, lots of robots. I can't say that the excesses of Transformers 2 are a surprise. Michael Bay would be no different. The only thing usually ""less"" in a typical Hollywood sequel - although there are several honorable exceptions - is a script. After all, coherence, logic and intelligent dialogues hinder robot fights, don't they?<br/><br/>While Transformers (the first), is an introductory tape of this universe with some level of quality (some, not much), but that simply does not allow us, with its mind-boggling cuts and shaky cameras, to understand what is happening or even to differentiate between robots and even among humans, the second film is more of the same, or rather, much more of the same. Michael Bay went crazy and created the two and a half hours more incoherent as possible and look that there is no need to go into the question of the geography used in the tape, as it is laughable enough to say that the robots go from the pyramids of Egypt to Petra, in Jordan , as if they were literally next to each other. Transformers is a production clearly aimed at male teenagers, as it combines three elements that always win the attention of this group: robots, cars and hot and unattainable women who, for some obscure reason, seem attracted by awkward nerds who ... like of robots and cars. Instead of focusing on the main plot, the film wastes time on ridiculously useless, pseudo-funny and inexcusable profanity and eschatological and racist jokes. Thus, the public has to endure sequences with copulating dogs, crazy middle-aged ladies, robots with iron testicles and incontinence problems and, mainly, the useless twins Autobots Mudflap and Skids. The problems of the script for the first film, such as the disconnected subplots (there were hackers and the minister, there was Sam, there were the military, etc.), are fixed in the worst way: putting all the characters in one plot. So expect to see Sam's relatives all running from the slow-motion explosions.<br/><br/>LaBeouf again embodies the ordinary youth in an unusual situation, a role that the actor lives with charisma. Megan Fox has the job of being ... well, hot, with the feature exploring her ""natural attributes"" as much as possible, including shots that resemble the series ""Baywatch"". What about the scenes with the physical gifts of Megan Fox, which Michael Bay knows how to exploit in the same way that porn directors do? Her first scene with her rear end painting on a motorcycle is embarrassing. Megan Fox does not seem to mind being used as a simple sexual object throughout the projection, even changing clothes in public and without any explanation just to make a declaration of love to her boyfriend (or ""affection"", since one of the subplots) ridiculous of the feature lies in the fact that Sam and Mikaela resist the word ""love""). Employing the old crutch of interpretation of her mouth smeared with red lipstick and her lips always parted (I believe this is what Fox understands to be ""character building""), the beautiful actress also does not seem to be bothered by the fact of Mikaela, despite from initially being presented as a strong and independent young woman, then being forced to embody the old cliché of the young lady who needs to be protected by the men around her - and just note that, throughout the film, there is always someone to hold the girl's hand when it is necessary to run away from robots. In the ""hot"" item of the film, Megan Fox has as a competitor the beautiful Australian debutant Isabel Lucas, who ""plays"" Alice, a college friend of Sam who basically shoots himself at him.<br/><br/>Despite the confusion of the montage by Michael Bay and team, it is undeniable that ILM's computer graphics work is a delight to the eye. The movement of the robots is fluid, believable and perfectly immersed within the environment in which they are inserted and the combat scenes are impressive when merging physical scenarios with beings created entirely on the computer. Watch, for example, how Bumblebee gesticulates nervously when Sam scolds him as he leaves the garage to face some angry appliances. On the other hand, the transformations of the creatures occur so quickly and confused that we can never understand the relationship between their alternative forms and the repositioning of their parts, which is unfortunate, but, I believe, necessary: after all, like a 3-car. meters long could it plausibly transform into a 10-meter-high robot?<br/><br/>New characters like Jetfire and the main villain Fallen have very interesting concepts, although extremely poorly explored. Jetfire, a dodgy decepticon and source of valuable information, becomes a transformer with Alzheimer's, while Fallen never justifies being so dangerous as to be adored by Megatron. Even so, several transformers appear only in the background, even some quite popular ones like Arcee, Ratchet and Ironhide. The classic Bumblebee continues to stand out.<br/><br/>Let's say that Michael Bay wants his films to climax all the time. However, the big problem is that there is no expectation at any time, and everything is meaningless. Twice worse, twice loud. The film has great moments in action, going through the hallucinating start in China, the chase on the college campus, the fantastic fight in the forest (high point of the film) and the final confrontation of the Egyptian desert. In fact, the ""final"" battle in the desert should easily be an hour long and you can't understand almost anything that's happening. Visually, we can only identify good robots from bad ones because it is simplistic enough to avoid any confusion about their personalities: Autobots are always depicted with strong colors and blue eyes, while Decepticons appear in metallic gray tones. and with red eyes. In addition, the work's internal logic begins to crumble completely, with robots that are super powerful a moment before starting to fall easily with half a dozen shots a few minutes later. Even with a completely flawed script and full of holes, it was to be expected at least to maintain a cohesive narrative structure. When the English title Fallen arrives, which in theory is the most powerful of the Decepticons, just two punches of Optimus Prime are enough to destroy it without any ceremony, demolishing the gore of history and all the suspense created around it and creating an anticlimactic and disappointing ending.<br/><br/>All of Michael Bay's habits are there, of course: the backlit maiden, the boring circular travellings until the excessive use of slow motion and low-angle framing that try to overestimate the heroism of the characters. In addition, there is no more ""authorial"" element in Bay's work than the explosions - and every five minutes something seems to be destroyed in an immense fireball in Transformers 2, which ends up becoming monotonous and commonplace. Populated by boring characters (from Sam's parents to his college roommates, past ex-agent Simmons from Turturro, ""cute"" robots and any creature with a single line throughout the film), Transformers 2 still proves the Bay's notorious egocentrism: if in the original he made a self-reference to Armageddon, here it is his turn to include a Bad Boys 2 poster in the college dormitory, which indicates that those college students have a bad taste proportional to their lack of intelligence.<br/><br/>""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" contains special effects and common defects. It is definitely not a transformative film (with a pun), but a large patchwork of well-stitched pieces, but without finishing. If you pull the thread of the script, it will drop the end to everything that is on the side because the primary idea is to have fun. The big problem is the spectator leaving 150 minutes of projection with absolutely nothing to emphasize on a work from the technical or visual side. Bay may not know how to make movies, but he knows how to film chaos, explosions and the military like no one else, especially considering his customary aversion to the use of the green screen, making the incendiary show of adventures that appears on the scene even more worthy of applause. And it is only the pyrotechnic and digital spectacle that makes this second endeavor of the franchise in cinemas something worthwhile for the general public to see this feature film (extremely long) in cinemas."

","This film rightfully deserves it's rating of 3 - Garbage. Because that's all it is and ever will be. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a victim of many things: the 2007/2008 'Writer's Strike', that resulted in the film's incoherent plot. It's also a victim of Michael Bay's obnoxious humour, that is crammed into this movie, and a victim of Michael's signature plain cringey moments that permeate this film to the core. <br/><br/>It's also a victim of Michael Bay's terrible oversexualisation, that also permeates most of his films. <br/><br/>Those things drag this film down to the terrible state it's in. But there are some good things about this film. The Forest Battle is excellent and is the best action scene in all the Bayformers films, ironically. And the CGI is very good, just as good as Jablonsky's epic score for this film. <br/><br/>But these things don't save this steaming pile of garbage. <br/><br/>Don't see this film unless you want to appreciate good movies even more because of it."

"JamesMovieGuy_117","4","0","2","8 February 2018"," overly long and tiresome
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was a movie, even as a young lad I found overly long and tiresome. All the flaws that the first movie had were magnified with more shouty characters, stereotypes, sexual innuendos, voyeurism and excessive action. <br/><br/>The first had a simple blockbuster plot, whereas this movie has so many plot threads and moves at such a fast pace it's confusing. There's also an overload of comic relief which is funny at times but loses its impact as the movie goes along. <br/><br/>However it isn't an irredeemable picture since the spectacular effects and sound design are all top notch as always. Even in the first movie I found the action scenes hard to follow since its often shot in medium/close-up instead of a nice wide shot showing off the giant robots. For once there's a fight shot in wide between Optimus Prime and Megatron before Optimus dies, only to be resurrected later for the plot's convenience. <br/><br/>Transformers was like the male variant of Twilight, they were both commercial franchise that appealed to certain gender desires. Twilight depicted the female fantasy of a man saving them in the most dire situations. Whereas Transformers showcased the male fantasies of beautiful scantily clad women loving a dorky lad for no apparent reason and of course action and explosions galore.<br/><br/>Now I don't believe Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is one of the worst movies ever, I've seen plenty of schlock to know what a truly terrible movie entails. However, this was definitely a downgrade from the first, which in retrospect wasn't all that great either. It was more of the same garbage in the first on a larger scale."

So how come the decepticons choose fighter jets and the idioticons, errr, the good robots choose to be cars. Now a yellow camaro is cool and all but since this is really a war, why continuously and idiotically keep choosing a vehicle that is 15 times slower than your enemy.
And they repeatedly over and over again against all logic make this absurd choice.<br/><br/>And the stupid writers of this movie just keep punishing us, the viewers with this moronic decision every chance they get.<br/><br/>So the decepticons are chasing you in the desert of egypt and you need to get to where the body of Optimus Prime is 50 miles away? Well let's drive there! So you can get stopped at the border.
And of course the bad robots know where you're going to so they fly there and in the plot take pot shots at you as you lug along at sub-100 MPH speeds.

","What a mess! Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Transformers 2 for the rest of this) fails in almost every way possible. You have a $200,000,000 or so budget and this is the best you can do? I'm not sure how often I've used this word to describe a film, but Transformers 2 is just stupid. Here's the long, but still incomplete, list of my many problems with the movie:<br/><br/>1. The plot is a disaster. More accurately, I should say the film lacks a plot. The movie is little more than one gag after the next, whether it's an attempt at comedy or a visual gag, none of it really flows into a cohesive film. I suppose the main point of the film is a Decepticaon known as The Fallen wants to use a machine buried under the pyramids to destroy the Sun. Why? It's never really explained why he wants to do this. If it is, it's lost in all the nonsense included in Transformers 2. The ""destroy the Sun"" bit is really nothing more than a McGuffin designed to make The Fallen look evil and create an adversary for Optimus to fight. There's no other purpose to it.<br/><br/>2. The comedy in this thing is misplaced and rarely funny. The ""comedy"" bits with the parents, the twin Autobots, and the roommate - none of their attempts at comedy are funny in the least. The parents are more cringey than funny, the twins are more offensive than funny, and the roommate is more annoying than funny. It doesn't work.<br/><br/>3. The runtime at 2.5 hours is at least an hour too long. There's so much unnecessary crap in Transformers 2 that could have been cut to make a tighter, more focused film. The scenes with the parents, the scenes with the roommate, and the whole Army/government power struggle could have been cut without affecting what little plot the movie has. Sitting through one unnecessary scene after the next makes Transformers 2 longer than it should have been and an incredibly arduous process.<br/><br/>4. I know some praise the special effects, but to me, they're weak. The robots look horrible. If they weren't meant to be giant piles of random junk thrown together haphazardly, then director Michael Bay succeeded in presenting his vision. But if all the expensive CGI was meant to present interesting, unique characters, the special effects fail on an epic scale. In the big fight scenes, it's almost impossible to distinguish on robot form the next. They all look equally horrible and just alike.<br/><br/>5. I suppose my biggest complaint and what all this leads to is that I'm not much of a fan of MIchael Bay's style of directing. Bigger and louder don't necessarily mean better. And the way the film jumps from one scene to the next, it makes me wonder if there's not a 6-year old with ADD trapped inside Bay's body. It gets annoying after about 5 minutes. Don't misunderstand - you can make a big special effects film if you've got a good story and interesting characters. But Bay seems to think that all you need to do is throw a wad of cash at CGI and that makes a good movie. Well, it doesn't as Transformers 2 proves."

","After a prosperous success of the very first Transformers, only the awareness of 2 years a brand new sequel comes arrives. Although, the outcome has been drastically different from its hype and anticipation. Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen is one of the most disappointing and downgrading sequels regarding its surprisingly satisfying predecessor. <br/><br/>Man, I don't know where to begin As expected, this action flick takes risks on clinching the wrong features the fans refusal, do not want. Due to the writer's strike involved behind the writers, the script was urgently required as the filming began so quickly. As a result, the plot of Revenge of The Fallen is an utter mess and disconcerting. Sam (Shia LaBeouf) gets the opportunity to move into college but a small slither of 'The Cube' affects him as he sees visions of the Transformers symbols that lead to a tomb made of the ancient Primes in order to protect 'The Matrix' that can awake Optimus Prime from his death to save Earth from a pending threat enforced by The Fallen and the Decepticons. First of all, the plot seems as if a 12-year-old thought of it. Second, the main portions of the plot is a misfire and nonsense. In the first film, Sam held the entire Cube running around for hours. In this movie, a tiny piece affects him as he holds it for only a second. It betrays the previous film's plot notably obvious. In addition, the film's first hour is vastly useless and uninteresting. Audiences and fans do not give a crap about Sam's college, his girlfriend Mikaela (Megan Fox) relationship, his irritating roommate with a messed up hair and the military/government conspiracy. As a consequence, the awesome Transformers feature in this movie for about 30 minutes in a 150-minute runtime. <br/><br/>Additionally, Revenge of The Fallen contains some of the most idiotic nonsense dialogue spoken and too much focus viewpoints of the military and government. By far the most offensive aspect is this film includes way more immature humor like sexual references, racist jokes, and stereotypes, and awkward jokes that attempt at being funny when it shouldn't. For a 150 minute film, it should keep the audiences invested or somewhat of entertaining enjoyment to track attention but this film fails at the terribly constructed storytelling, the pacing, and the editing issues, and too much centralizing the humans instead of the transformers but still lacks a human emotional touch. As a result, it is boring <br/><br/>Disregarding it's redeeming quality issues, Transformers: Revenge of The Fallen has some frantic impressive visual effects that look very realistic. Furthermore, the forest battle between Optimus Prime and the Decepticons are certainly entertaining to watch. Also, Devastator's transformation is largely cool and enjoyable. This action flick has some exciting entertaining sequences and contains solid eye candy visuals. The acting, especially from Megan Fox, has improved over the latest film (but she is still bad) but most are just adequately serviceable. <br/><br/>Overall, Transformers Revenge of The Fallen is a downgrading, disappointing, and majorly unsatisfying sequel. Surely, it has stunning visual effects, some truly entertaining moments, and exhilarating eye candy. Nevertheless, in the long run, it sums up as a noisy, under plotted, and overlong giant clamorous extravaganza which completely misses what fans want. <br/><br/>Grade: D+"

The Michael Bay-directed film operates off the premise that the Transformers had come to Earth long ago. In the present, an elite military squad called NEST led by Major Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sargeant Epps (Tyrese Gibson) works with the Autobots to hunt Decepticons. In a destructive battle in Shanghai, Optimus Prime takes down a Decepticon but receives a warning of the Fallen.

Michael Bay is renowned for not giving the slightest damn about a movies story, and that's all good and well but why is he making 2 and a half hour movies? This movie is filled with scenes that make about as much sense as the third Matrix movie, but yet it's even dumber. For god's sake's people, he put testicles on one of the robots. I really don't have much to even say other than this is one of the worst things mankind has ever created. At the very least it ranks among the Pearl Harbor attacks in terms of total disaster.

The Twins: Look like crap sound like crap basically crap! They also have the most screen time. OK so the only reason I gave it a 5 was because of the action scenes and visual effects. OK so the worst thing of the movie is.... The Humans get The Most Screen time!!!!! I don't care if you like that or not but it is horrible!!!!

I know, who cares, but lack for details bugs me at times.<br/><br/>Devastator is turned into some Godzilla-esque creature with balls? Again,I know, the balls are a comic-relief punchline in the midst of an ongoing battle but still, felt dumb.<br/><br/>Why is the alpha villain/enemy of the franchise Megatron turned to a minor servant in front of the ""made-up for this movie"" Fallen?<br/><br/>Final stand-off, Screen filled with countless Decepticons who all look the same, would be more fun to bring 3-4 real ones from the cartoons and focus on them. Wouldn't look army- like but be more interesting. Soundwave is wasted on space-hanging?<br/><br/>It was more important to make the military look powerful than the Autobots for the last fight. We will save you giant robots!<br/><br/>Firefly.....why..?<br/><br/>The tiny roomie bot...why?..again.<br/><br/>The positives:<br/><br/>The fun is still here.

","I must say I was kinda surprised that I sort of enjoyed the first ""Transformers"" movie from 2007, but sadly I cannot say the same about this Oscar-nominated sequel and second of so far 4 films. The first half is utterly forgettable. The second half has a couple decent moments mostly thanks to John Turturro, who is fun to watch as always. And you have to say about the franchise that they have a lead actor in Shia LaBeouf, who is almost too good for the material. This certainly does not apply to Megan Fox who returns as the female main character, but adds almost nothing to the film apart from one scene perhaps when she wants to train a little evil robot to become good. Labeouf's character in the mean time wants to sleep with another chick, which sort of puts a heavy question mark behind his character from the first film who is totally in love with Fox', but luckily his mating partner here is just an evil robot in disguise and it's not elaborated on any further. That scene was fun though, but yeah, this is not really drama movie in terms of the relationships between characters and the whole ""I Love You"" part felt really cringeworthy at times, partially because of Fox, partially because of the script.<br/><br/>The second half of this film here is certainly better than the first and the desert is a nice setting for all the battled depicted in here. Also the comedy from Turturro, but also the good robots, works on many occasions and it is a shame that the film tries to be so much more beyond pointless action fun with huge special effects. Because if it had been a little less ambitious in certain areas, then this could have been as good as the original. But it is not and director Michael Bay unsurprisingly does not have the talent to deliver in any areas that go beyond what we see. Then again, you have to say in his favor that he is not one of the writers here and they did the worst job I guess, which is particularly disappointing as you'd expect three people to come up with something better. Nonetheless, this was again a huge box office success, so it's no surprise that several more ""Transformers"" films followed this one. As for me, I do not have a lot of interest too see them, even if I hope they maybe can take the best parts from this very long 150-minute movie and elaborate on these in the next films. If that is the case, I will once again have a good time watching I guess. But I do not recommend ""Transformers 2"". Thumbs down."

","If the first Transformers movie was passable, this one comes up short of the low standards set by its predecessor. TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN has bigger action setpieces, but at the expense of a coherent script, likable characters and a general reason to give a crap about anything that happens. If all you care about are action sequences with hunks of metal duking it out, you'll be in heaven. I was not. My sole memory of seeing this in theaters was leaving with a headache. While I didn't have the same experience watching it on Blu-ray some five years later, a lot of what is wrong with this film stuck out to me even more. Since the AllSpark from the previous entry is all but destroyed, they had to come up with a new MacGuffin. They came up with Energon and something called the Matrix of Leadership, which is as ill-defined as the AllSpark was, except that there's more pointless backstory and exposition to go with it. Another thing that got more screen-time was Michael Bay's unique sense of ""humor."" We're treated to two Autobots who are vaguely racist caricatures as well as an abundance of sexual humor that falls flat most of the time. And more exposition. And military porn. And things hitting other things in slo-mo. There is literally nothing to admire about this movie other than some great scenery, landscape shots and (admittedly) jaw-dropping visual effects. This movie is about Transformers, but the most succinct plot description is ""Guy finally says 'I love you' to his girlfriend."" Pathetic. This movie is pure eye candy, to be sure, but it's the kind that you can break your teeth on if you aren't careful."

","While Transformers was watchable entertainment and at a reasonable amount of decibels, this atrocity is somehow less then below par. With a story as cryptic and senseless as the symbols Sam scribbles at the films beginning, this is a disappointment even considering the low plotting standards automatically set in regards to a Micheal Bay film. Grossing just over one billion dollars, this is clearly a franchise which is here to stay. Our silly director seems to feel that explosive shouldn't mean awe inspiring, but it should be taken as, ""We need more explosions and maybe some more robots just for good measure."" Clocking in at over two and a half hours with a 90 minute plot, scaling a pyramid, the bloated running time is a main factor in the annoyance in this films existence alone. The sound effects are deafening and repetitive. If you watch this at home, your neighbors will call the police with a noise complaint. Sam is terrorized by a searing hot model who is actually a robot,(of course), and has a metal snake which slithers out of her rear end. Megan Fox is the only attractive thing in this film, yet her presence is constantly and sadly ruined with a perverted RC robot humping her leg. Shia LaBoeuf is an irritation on screen rather then a part of the story on screen, and the pair of racist, foul mouthed robots is as unwelcome as a Blade Runner sequel. The new robot villain has a beard(?), because when technology ages, it develops Gray hairs and wrinkles, not corrosion. In conclusion, Micheal Bay should stop recycling scrap metal, and should instead consider disposing of it, preferably off screen."

Sam is having hallucinatory episodes of Cybertronian symbols, and is being hunted by the Decepticons under the orders of an ancient Decepticon named The Fallen (Tony Todd), who seeks to get revenge on Earth by finding and activating a machine that would provide the Decepticons with an energon source, destroying the Sun and all life on Earth in the process.<br/><br/>The story is very incoherent, but I still watch this movie and like I said, this movie had a lot to go through before being released and I am not going to talk about this movie. My god, man. I can't hate this movie.<br/><br/>If there is one thing I hate about this movie, that is a scene where Optimus Prime is killed by Megatron and I did feel some emotion in the scene, but I almost cried because he was killed and did not come back into this film until before the end credits come on and when he comes back, it is okay, but I just did wish they did not kill him off in the middle portion of the film.<br/><br/>The visual effects on the Transformers are really amazing as hell and it was fantastic, but the CGI on the Fallen is a little off, but it is really amazing. The musical score by Steve Jablonsky is really amazing and the score is just fantastic as hell, especially with the other Transformers films and the scary movie remakes produced by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller, this includes the Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday THE 13th remakes. The acting is amazing. Shia LaBeouf once again plays Sam Witwicky and he does an amazing job.

The other person, Ramon Rodriguez is funny as hell as Leo in this film and I would have liked to have seen him in the third film as well.<br/><br/>This would be the last film to be distributed by DreamWorks Pictures as Paramount Pictures distributed future films in the franchise.<br/><br/>Overall, with TRANSFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, I love and hate this film and that's pretty much it. I give it a 5 out of 10 because I have the two-disc DVD and I watched the special features and even the documentary and I felt sorry for the filmmakers and cast doing this film, but they made one hell of a sequel. Critics should have gave this movie a lot of critical praise for this movie.<br/><br/>This is Michael Bay's worst reviewed films along with Pearl Harbor, Transformers: Age of Extinction and Bad Boys II."

","If you like to see things get destroyed, boy, is Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen a real treat for you! If you like flashy special effects, you will love this. Transformers is so busy showing you just how cool robots waging war on each other can be, it forgot to actually make sense. When Sam's parents show up in the desert, I felt like I got a little taste of the brownie Mrs. Wintwicky sampled at college, which took more than its fair share of screen time. I came here to watch robots, not 18 year olds getting overly excited about campus life. Though in the movie's defense, it did have the movie's greatest pay-off, so just bear with its seeming idiocy.<br/><br/>The whole movie felt like an elaborate, destructive dream sequence. Good if you literally have nothing else to do. Bad if you want your brain to function. Here's how to check if your logic skills haven't been blown to pieces... what is strange about Mikaela when she's doing all that running in the desert? Hint: All that dust. All that dirt. All those explosions. Mikaela (or rather her wardrobe) gets an A+ for consistently clean white jeans. I'm so jealous. Someone better let the rest of the cast in on the secret, because they're running around in less than pristine condition. (I felt especially bad for Mrs. Wintwicky, which brings me to yet another question... What is she doing in the desert? Huh? Did I miss something?) So great apparently is the magic of Megan Fox. Or maybe screaming Leo just didn't deserve to look clean. That's what you get for panicking during the entire movie, Leo. <br/><br/>Speaking of running, who knew having alien robots that can transform into cars required so much legwork? Maybe Michael Bay's casting choices were based on a single question, ""Can you run? Show me how you run."" When they aren't running, they're hiding. All the while, if you haven't shut your brain off, you will be asking the pivotal question, why? Rest assured, because you do not need answers for in the end, the power of leadership, courage, destiny, and all that wishy-washy feel good stuff trump everything else, including death. If you end the movie eye-rolling, congratulations. They are a sign of your brain trying to reboot itself from the nightmare. It's a good sign. It's okay. You survived."

You do hear a lot of werewolves talking about silver, or vampires talking about the sun. <br/><br/>You don't care about any of the characters, the only character that is somewhat cool is Optimus Prime. Megan Fox and Shia la bitch are not compelling at all.<br/><br/>The comedy is not funny. Comedy is subjective, but this is the lazy writing. The mom is one of the most annoying characters of all time.<br/><br/>Some of the action is fun, I like the forest fight. Most of it sucks. The directing and editing is so incomprehensible you can barely tell what is going on. The movie follows a basic 3 act structure, and you can predict a lot of the events.<br/><br/>The worst thing of the movie is this: it is booooooooooooooooooooriiiiiiiiiiiiing.

","Transformers ROTF was a fitting sequel for the successful blockbuster released back in 2007. Unfortunately the numerous problems felt during the sequel production such as the writer's stryke ended up undermining the final result, as the director Michael Bay himself confirmed. The lack of time and/or the short script which Bay had access to may have indeed affected the production process, considering he didn't have that much to work with. Whether those were just excuses for the ""failure"" it doesn't matter. Bay had to adjust the sequel and ended up highlighting the action (as always) bits at the expense of dialogue, character's development etc. Despite Bay's critics concerning the ""mystical"" tone given to the script by the writer's IMO it was what saved the movie and ended up pulling me back to watch it more than once (something that did't happen with the third installment of the franchise). Overall, a decent sequel."
"RossRivero99","4","0","5","7 October 2014"," One of the worst movies of 2009
","When I first watched Michael Bay's Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen I happened to think that it was really good due to the action sequences and the effects, when at the time I didn't even pay attention to what the story was really about. The movie stars Shia Labeouf who reprises his role as Sam Witwicky a recent high school graduate who is in the process of going to college with the escort of his dumb parents Judy Witwicky the annoying (played by Julie White), and Ron the pessimist Witwicky (played by Kevin Dunn). But while Sam is starting college the decepticons want to cause a ruckus in China in the town of Shanghai, when you see any Transformers movie sequel you start to think that Oh the vehicles are good but Bay uses way too much effects because he doesn't care about a good story, and people including myself really do wish that Michael Bay could put a lot more effort whenever he makes a movie because a lot of his movies are considered plain terrible for example (to name a few) Armageddon (1998), Bad Boys 2 (2003), Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011), and Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014). In this movie there is rarely any good acting and no good screenplay, what I really do wish is that the next time that Michael Bay makes a movie is that it could be a well done movie just like the first Transformers movie was, and the reason why I think that the Dark of the Moon as well as this one were bad sequels in the Transformers franchise is three things, one he is full of himself, two maybe he only wanted to direct the first Transformers movie, and three maybe his obsession for Transformers characters that end up being in movies and whichever one he directs he just wants to get the film over with."
"Tyson14","3","0","5","15 August 2014"," Bay_ware of nausea
","It was almost inevitable that a second Transformers movie would be made, given that a largely crude and sell able formula was used for the first. Eye candy makes up for about 95% of the target audiences expectations, after all.<br/><br/>So it was a great pity that Michael Bay tried even harder to ensure that the maturer audience almost keeled over from motion sickness and extreme face-palming... Not only is 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' a tiresome sequel-by-numbers, but it has more flaws than a Wickes catalogue.<br/><br/>The original movie was almost a guilty pleasure; pure popcorn entertainment that you can easily disengage your brain to enjoy (as with Armageddon). 'Revenge...', however, follows in Terminator 3's footsteps by claiming the events that lay ahead were inevitable, therefore creating a disbelief that spoils what is left of a completely preposterous story.<br/><br/>Shia LaBeouf is excellent once again as the socially awkward Sam, but it's a pity (for some) that Megan Fox is once again present for her physical assets rather than acting ability. 'Revenge...' takes this a step further with cringeworthy close-ups and completely unnecessary shots of Fox showing off those seductive functions, although to be fair, the first half of the movie is edited in such a frantic and confusing manner that you're never aware of what's going on, and the significance of such. This spontaneity makes it difficult to understand what Sam's entry into college had to do with anything, and why we need stupid jokes that go against any kind of drama from the, for lack of better term, dork room mates.<br/><br/>Talking of bad humour, it seems the transformers themselves have spent too much time around the cast as they themselves produce truly tepid one-liners that the Christmas crackers author to shame. I'm guessing the scriptwriter thought this may appeal to the hyperactive under-10's in the audience, who think things are awesome/'epic' very easy.<br/><br/>The most frustrating aspect about this movie isn't how it could have been compressed into half the runtime, but for how in that period, it manages to conjure so many ridiculous plot holes and bad mistakes. Since when was full colour film available in 1932? How did the marines get to Egypt in under an hour? Why did no-one discover those GIANT WEAPONS inside the pyramids of Giza for over a century? Why does a transformer who's been dormant in a museum require a beard and walking stick? And why oh why, in typical American pig-ignorance, did they give him the most English of English voices just because he's a bumbling fool and knowledgeable? Jee-wizz...<br/><br/>I should also point out that someone in the CGI department believes Optimus Prime - a behemoth weighing many tones - can casually stand on the edge of an aircraft carrier without affecting the vessels waterline or stability?<br/><br/>Please... someone fire this guy.<br/><br/>As a movie-going experience, this sequel is expectedly disappointing. It will please children that love two and half of hours of their daily CGI-count, but it is truly a nauseating and ridiculous product that, sadly, represents the state of the movie industry at this point in time... Hype sells."
"CinemaCocoa","5","0","3","12 July 2014"," The Writer's Strike SINKS full potential for the franchise
","What a way to shoot yourself in the foot. Dive bombing so much promise into an eternity of hatred; instantly switching a blooming franchise into a notorious cluster of nonsense.<br/><br/>With Decepticon leader Megatron disposed of, the Autobots receive reinforcements and team up with human soldiers to hunt down the remaining Decepticons. But little do they know that an ancient Decepticon, known as The Fallen, seeks to destroy Earth. Sam, a college freshman now, holds the key to The Fallen's final plan. Or something like that.<br/><br/>Okay, so I will be honest... this film is deplorable. A fine line divides what I consider good (the 2007 film) and this, and it mostly comes down to a tragically misaligned screenplay. Scenes come and go, no build up, no tension, no anticipation, no reason, and this mash lasts for over one-hundred and fifty minutes! The reason for this is simple; during the film's development and production there was a strike at the screenwriter's guild. Lead writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman only had a premise before filming began (that's right, no script) so a third writer, Ehren Kruger, was called in to start work on the film. Plus, Michael Bay himself worked on the script, story and even design of some robots. They also had no plans for a sequel to begin with since Transformers '07 was a bigger hit than expected, and a release date barely more than a year after conception was far too optimistic. Need I say more?<br/><br/>A lot of people don't appreciate how Bay's influence here is much greater than in the first film, or all of these production problems, and ultimate condemn all three films to be equal to its worst part. This part.<br/><br/>This film should be the darker turn in the series: the Decepticons are here and want revenge but no... RotF is packed with unnecessary characters, scenes and a surreal focus on all the wrong things. Terrible comedic turns, cool characters are ignored for unbearable racist stereotypes, character development that bears no emotional impact. The script is noisy and repetitive and the editing is ugly (did I mention that Bay actually re-uses footage, including some from the first film!) You could argue, as I have in the past, that this is Transformers! It is silly and it is a cartoon for kids, it shouldn't mean anything. But there's being entertaining, and then there's being obnoxious.<br/><br/>The film still looks good. The opening battle in Shanghai is awesome and feels like a good start to the continuation of the series, the robots are fifty-fifty of good and bad designs outside of the returning characters (some of them are very creative looking). It was wonderful to see Ravage in live action, and I am one of the few who liked Jetfire and Soundwave. Sadly though the climax of the movie is far too messily shot to feel rewarding and the worst crime of all: we barely see the Transformers actually transform. Unlike the first film, this one doesn't glorify it with any scenes tailored specifically for transformations.<br/><br/>I was disappointed even upon the first viewing, and though I still say the Transformers themselves redeem some of its awfulness, the more I watch it... the more I get tired of the rife Bay-isms. At best this is a guilty pleasure, more than the other films in the series."

"CowherPowerForever","3","0","3","21 June 2014"," Transformers: Revenge of my Wallet
","In 2007 Michael Bay and company brought Transformers to life with the first Transformers like action film. While the film was not perfect it was a solid summer action film that delivered overall. Two years later the sequel, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was released. It is nowhere near the first film, and frankly that had a lot to do with the downplaying of action, lame script writing, and far too much humor.<br/><br/>Watching this film again was such a pain. Sitting there for more than two hours and twenty minutes was like watching paint dry. This sequel had almost nothing the first film had. The acting in the first film was miles better. This film felt like pushing useless humor that was far too over the top, and you could even say downright offensive, instead of giving us more action. Also writing Optimus Prime out of the movie for a large portion of it, only to have him return to save the day in the final minutes was a giant slap in the face to fans of the first movie and really a slap in the face to any Transformer fans. It is just lazy writing. Something I will talk more about in the coming paragraphs.<br/><br/>Michael Bay returns for his second outing as director for a Transformer film. I liked a lot of what Bay did in the first movie. Sure the acting was nothing special, but a big reason to see the first movie, the amazing action scenes, were a joy to watch on the big screen, and even now on home video. The action in this film was simply drowned out by borderline offensive comedy at times, and child like humor that really had no place in this film. I complained about the humor in the first film, but in this film, they rolled up all the humor of the first film and multiplied it by one hundred and sprinkled childish all over it. That and the action scenes are so few and far between. This film was about ten minutes longer than the first film yet the action was short in all. I like Michael Bay doing big time action movies, but his effort in this film was poor.<br/><br/>Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman are back to write another Transformer film, and while their effort was average in the first film, it didn't really hurt the film at all. This time these two fools managed to take the bad from the first film, and make it worse. Ehren Kruger also gets a writing credit in this film, and later in the third film, Dark of the Moon. The effort overall from these three writers is shameful. Some of the humor as I mentioned a few times is borderline offensive. A lot of the humor has to do with the male private area, and this is suppose to be a big time summer blockbuster that is at least suppose to be taken somewhat seriously. Another huge problem with the film was the story itself. Not even half way into the film Optimus Prime is ""killed"", only to return later in the film with only minutes left. He of course saves the day and minutes later they film goes to black. This might be the definition of lazy writing. To have your major character completely disappear for a large portion of the film is downright crazy. Which is why I consider this film to be one of the worst of its kind. The first film was nothing Oscar worthy, but at least they didn't completely tear apart their main character and continue to push the envelope on stupid humor.<br/><br/>Overall if you enjoyed the first live action Transformer film back in 2007, you will likely be highly disappointed in this film. To the few and far between average action scenes, to the useless humor, to the lazy writing, this film was just a giant mess. For a franchise to start out better than average like it did with the 2007 film, and to fall so far like this film did, is just very sad.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Were Transformers (2007) brought us something new this brings us a thing that I have some problems with. On part of the acting I don't have any problems but it's the way some things are done and shown that made me think, what the hell, this is for kiddies. <br/><br/>The effects are again sublime but I do had a few problems with some transformers. There are two small cars that can transform, once they did they really reminded me of Cars (2006). They had teeth that were laughable and they also act childish. That doesn't add anything and makes this flick going towards the jokes done in M.I.B. (1997). But not only that, the talking of those small spider robots I didn't like either. In the first flick they talk their language but now they can talk English with an accent and again it doesn't make them believable anymore. The story itself is rather good although it's written in two sentences. There's still a part of The Cube on earth, by coincidence it's in Sam's hands. <br/><br/>Megan Fox is here two years older than in Transformers and she is indeed more sexy and could have been the next thing but she showed that her mind was a terrible thing to taste. She had said stupid things toward the director Michael Bay and towards others which has led to the fall of Megan Fox. From becoming a blockbuster girl she is almost not seen anymore. She only performed in Jennifer's Body (2009) that was worth mentioning but was broken down by critics. The end for Fox.<br/><br/>For me The Revenge Of The Fallen is on the edge of becoming ridiculous but the effects made it worth watching.

Adding more humor to the movie would've been better. Like in the first one where that queer was trying to hide the robots from his parents was pretty funny. This one contained to much drama as well. I hate drama movies, they are so boring and pointless. We all know that movies never have a bad ending or else it won't be as entertaining. Adding the part where that guy acts like a moron was also stupid to add as well. I guess being a moron is natural to that actor. Why did they also have that hot chick suddenly change into a robot as well. Where they trying to scare some kids or something?"

","I am one of maybe a handful of people that didn't hate this movie. The complaints pertaining to this movie are endless to say the least, but I am here to give my 2 cents.<br/><br/>First: The Parents Many have said that they were unfunny and shouldn't have been in the movie. The parents had 3 scenes if I counted right. The first was when Sam is preparing to go off to college, but his mom is reminiscing about him as a baby. All moms do this, and yet suddenly in a movie it's unheard of. The father is putting the moves on the mom before leaving the house. They're married, get over it. At the college, the mom gets high and goes A-wall. This was stupid, but lasted a minute, get over it. It's called a mid-life crisis. Last scene is in the desert with Sam. Once again this is very brief, the mom is very calm, the father is scared for his son. Very natural given where they are and what they are doing.<br/><br/>Twin Robots Who can forget the ""racist"" robots that talked liked Gangsters and were poorly animated. These guys were in for a while but they weren't given that much dialogue and they did end of helping in the end with the monster in the desert. <br/><br/>The length Michael Bay wouldn't give us a half ass 1hr 30 min version. The final battle is drawn out in length, but that was the best part. Intense action scenes don't blow over in 10 min.<br/><br/>I am not trying to defend this movie, I am just saying my thoughts. People blow this out of proportion as to how bad it is. The script needed work, yes and the Spanish kid was f**king annoying, and Megan Fox was no use at all, but that aside I had a really fun time with this movie. I also, don't get why everyone bashes John Turturro's character. He brings so much energy and life to the scenes that you never start to doze off and yet people say he is rambunctious and annoying. <br/><br/>Whether you love it or hate it, this is not a bad movie, it's just a fun action movie that doesn't succeed in any other areas."

Not as much comic relief, thankfully the action was there but I think it should have had a darker undertone. Nothing like the first and seriously brought the franchise down.

Typical 80's cartoon revival movie: great CGI, crappy story. As a kid I was a big fan of the comics and cartoons, so that sets some expectations.<br/><br/>I understand making a movie you have to change stuff in the original story. But I wonder if Mr Bay or any of the writers even bothered to check any of the old comics? Jetfire for instance, it's not an ancient Autobot, but a non-living jet-fighter build on Earth by the Decepticons. Later on the Autobots gave it life-force and he joined up with them. I know it's a detail but hey could just make up a new Transformer to account for that part instead of using Jetfire.<br/><br/>Also the story is kinda flawed. I mean 'it takes a Prime to kill a Prime'? Ow com'on! And don't get me started on the twin Autobots, they were just too irritating. Why does Bay insists on using such characters to add a comical side after the huge failure of that crappy Phantom Menace Jar-Jar goof? But still this is a very entertaining movie.

","I'm quite late to reviewing this. Clearly. Simply wanted to say a few things..... Firstly, anyone who would go to see the sequel of a movie that they didn't like, must be beyond idiotic. Also, comparing any incredibly influential director(i.e. Hitchcock, Welles, Kubrick etc.) to modern day directors is just plain ridiculous. I'm sick of hearing it. Really. To me, that's like comparing Alexander Graham Bell to Steve Jobs. In a way they are similar, but in many more ways they are not. Same thing goes for a classic cult film and a brand spankin' new cinematic blockbuster. Two different beasts. If you have expectations that an action movie would be nothing less than a masterpiece, especially one with fictional robots, then I would be overjoyed to know that you are disappointed. Just don't ruin it for most everyone else by giving low reviews, and justifying those reviews with nonsense. You don't go to McDonald's awaiting nutritious, healthy eats only to be surprised when they hand you a greasy cheeseburger and fries. Seriously people, just use your heads and form your own opinions.

I could not take this movie seriously.

","Unlike the first movie, this one takes very little time to establish the plot over time. It gets into the fighting very quickly, and it's exciting and there's all these explosions that we of course paid to see. The problem is that it fails to pace itself or work on anything more than minor plot points (most of which don't make sense, seriously ghost robots?) to progress to the next fight and eventually it becomes tedious having little change. It can't rise and have a dramatic climax because the entire film is one long sequence of action and so it's overall effect is diminished.<br/><br/>Watch it if you feel like switching your brain off for over 2 hours so you can get past the uninteresting characters and plot. It really is as you would expect: constant robot fights."

It might of been better. without that strike, but maybe it wouldn't have been. Im only hoping for the best since Bay took out fox for the last of the trilogy.

Because of the bad story and cynical approach you don't really care who's fighting who, but that's not all, because from all the shaking, zooming and quick-cutting you can't even tell who's fighting who. Last third of the film is purely non-stop action, and it can get a little boring, but still...those effects are impressive. And I didn't even watch it in a theatre.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a stupid, needless, cynically bad but in a certain mindset also a fun movie. Perhaps a guilty pleasure for some. I'd say this would count as garbage entertainment for kids, if not for the shots of Megan Fox's ass, because that's a whole other demographic. That's not exactly material for 7-year old kids interested in Transformers toys. Because in the end, all of this is about toys."

","I do not rate movies 1 out of 10 very often, but this movie is truly terrible. Michael Bay once again succeeded in completely missing the point of what CG is all about. CG is a tool, not a replacement for any coherent plot and even acceptable acting. I do not expect a popcorn action movie to have a really intricate plot line or first class acting, but some minimum is required; you can only gloss over so many insufficiencies with more explosions and CG. The movie is incredibly fast-paced, which I attribute to an attempt to prevent movie-goers from stopping to think about all the plot holes and sappy lines. Non of the characters are at all fleshed out, the characters added for comic relief are simply annoying and not even remotely funny.<br/><br/>To sum this movie up in a few words I'd say that anyone planning on watching it can prepare for a bunch of well-animated CG explosions and machine gun-totting robots, but nothing in terms of plot or acting."

","I have to admit I saw this at the cinema when it came out. It was the first film I had seen on the big screen for a long time and I'll admit to having been slightly (very much) blown away by it at the time. Now, just over a year later I have given it a second viewing and, having seen a lot more films in between, I have somewhat changed my opinion. Man can do that right? Change their minds? Just thought I'd check.<br/><br/>Optimus Prime and the Autobots, with some new members, are seeking out Decepticon agents around the Earth. They are helped by an international military force called NEST. Sam Witwicky has found a shard of the 'AllSpark', a device which was destroyed in the first Transformers movie, which he accidentally touches. He is preparing to go to college, leaving his girlfriend Mikaela Barnes and Bumblebee, his Autobot guardian, behind. Having arrived at college, he finds himself blacking out and seeing mysterious symbols. A worried Mikaela flies out to join him and Bumblebee also makes his way there to protect his ward. The Decepticons know what these symbols mean and they want Sam I think that's enough about the plot.<br/><br/>First of all, the CGI work on this film is excellent, some really cool effects and some excellent stunt work combine to make it visually quite stunning. Unfortunately I found I didn't warm to any of the characters, they had no depth and so it ended up being quite a hollow experience. So with no stand-out performances, honourable mentions go to Shia LaBeouf as Sam and Megan Fox as Mikaela; Josh Duhamel returned as Captain Lennox and John Turturro also returned as Agent Simmons / Jetfire. Kevin Dunn and Julie White also return as Sam's parents Ron and Judy Witwicky. The Transformers were voiced by Peter Cullen (Optimus Prime), Hugo Weaving (Megatron) and Tony Todd (The Fallen).<br/><br/>Over all a visually exciting and even, at times, an entertaining film that unfortunately has little depth. The running time is far too long, which also doesn't help. I guess if you're a fourteen year old boy then you'll enjoy this, but ultimately you'll only remember the funny bit on the pyramid and some of the robot fight scenes. So, not really recommended if you're a serious movie lover, but if you're young at heart and want to switch your brain off for a while, go for it!<br/><br/>My score: 5.4/10"

","""Revenge of the Fallen"" contained many of the elements that made the first ""Transformers"" film so exciting and worth seeing over and over again: full of action, metal clanking against each other, huge alien robots creating massive destruction, a certain alien item that would determine the fate of entire Transformer race, and many returning actors. What made this movie no greater than average, as compared to its solid predecessor, was a lack of plot, brainless, inappropriate humor, and no originality in that it seemed to be almost a carbon copy of the first ""Transformers."" This film was painful in its sexuality jokes, nonstop the entire film. The plot was extremely choppy and very stretched, and for a movie of extraterrestrial robots the size of buildings smacking into each other for months on end, it took itself way too seriously. The Dreamworks studio, Michael Bay, Spielberg, and anyone else involved in this film's production needs to evaluate its large audience comprised of children and realize that it's wrong to expose them to such inappropriate humor, much less adults. And, if they're going for adults as their target audience, than provide a plot with substance. They seemed to have missed the mark on not one, but two demographics. Lasers and special effects are always entertaining, but without anything significant behind it for two hours can become a bit of a time-waster, especially considering the sexual filth that littered this particular sequel."

","To a seasoned movie watcher, those sequels that are simply trying to leverage more money out of our pockets, because the first movie rocked, are obvious, and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Of particular bad taste was turning Megan Fox into a sex toy for male gratification. Yes, she is one very hot woman, but do we really need to see her straddled on a motorbike, grinding her hips into it in slow motion? Do we really need to see her sashaying down a college hallway in a schoolgirl skirt in slow motion, etc etc??? The first movie was excellent but was marred by one problem I see a lot of in newer, heavy fx based movies - they have the action scenes TOO CLOSE to the subject matter, so you can't really see what's going on, just a lot of very fast close up images of various robot parts zipping by smashing into stuff. This movie took that to a new level. The only scene that was memorable to me was the 'rumble in the jungle' forest battle scene were the Deceptacons bring serious hurt to Optimus. And only when they ZOOMED OUT and actually showed the battle properly! The lead character, who had some moxy and edge with his 'poor loser buys old junker and get's hot babe' routine, now completely blows it in the sequel, proving he is just a really bad actor that benefited from some good writing in the first movie.<br/><br/>Transformers will forever be the first movie, this one was TERRIBLE."

"geniuskentyk-1","5","0","7","9 July 2010"," A horrible sequel to an amazing film
","I went to see ROTF in IMAX, and yes, the movie is much bigger, louder, and crazier than the first movie. However, all those things together doesn't make the sequel better than the first 'Transformers' movie. The first movie was better than ROTF (like 9/10). It had a more human aspect to the film, while ROTF has a more mechanical/robotic feel. In the first film, the robots were toned down in favor of character development for the human characters. I liked that it didn't totally rely on special effects, and that I actually cared for the characters. In the sequel, the human characters, for the most part, just run around as they hunt for something. The robots have more speaking roles this time around, but it's a let down. I hate most of the personalities and the voices that many of the transformers had. The 'Twins' were annoying with their stereotypical gangster slang and attitude, although they did have maybe one or two funny moments. The little blue robot was also annoying with his voice (the voice actor of Spongebob), but I soon grew fond of the character (too bad he's totally left out in the finale and final fight). Jetfire (the old robot) had a stereotypical grumpy/grouchy-old-man personality, and that got on my nerves. His character was over-the-top. I would've liked him more if the filmmakers toned him down a bit. Also, with the addition of so many robots in this movie, the 'Transformers' film franchise has become more cartoonish, which I don't like. There were many 'Frenzy'-like characters in the sequel (frenzy was the crazy small robot from the first film), but Frenzy was more realistic since he didn't have a cartoonish appeal and he didn't speak (in English) that much. Since there's so many new robots this time around (like 42, compared to the 10? in the first movie) most of them either don't talk at all, or get one line in. The big robot in the final fight (Devastator – the one that's made from the combination of six or seven robots) was very underused and a waste. His big character could've been great. Also, there seemed to be two identical robots: the six or seven robots that combined seemed to each have an identical robot fight in the battle at the same time. This confused me, but it probably won't confuse people that don't know the individual characters. {Spoiler Alert: I hated the addition of 'Alice', the hot girl that gets all over the main character. If the robots could transform into humans, why transform into vehicles? It's more convenient to be a human. Spoiler Alert Over}. Although there was a lot of things I felt was wrong with the movie, I still enjoyed it. The fights were better this time around (although i liked the first film's final fight more than the second film's final fight). The forest fight where Optimus is fighting three decepticons was cool, but it was like 5 minutes long. If it was longer, I would've appreciated it more. Oh, that reminds me – I HATE the way Optimus Prime talks. Every word that comes out of his mouth is a cliché! Also, a thought just came into my mind: What happened to the cop-car-decepticon (Barricade) from the first movie. He didn't appear in the final fight for the first film, and he didn't appear at all in the second film! He was my favorite decepticon from the first movie. Since I'm talking about Decepticons now, imma say a little something about Megatron and Starscream. Megatron was badass in the first movie, while in this one he's just a little servant to The Fallen. Megatron is stronger in ROTF but he doesn't do much. The only good part he had was in the forest fight with Optimus. Starscream was also annoying because he does nothing. He bickers with Megatron more, but I hate the way Starscream fights. He stays in vehicle form and just shoots at the enemies. Now, about The Fallen. The concept of him being the main bad guy in ROTF was cool, but the way he was portrayed in the movie was dumb. He was barely in the film, and in the final fight he barely does anything. Also, when he fought, it was for about 2 minutes before it was over. Bummer. The Fallen wasn't even as menacing as Megatron was in the first movie. The villains this time around just suck. The subtitle 'Revenge of the Fallen' is a double meaning. It means the revenge of the fallen decepticons, and also means the revenge of the character called 'The Fallen.' However, in ROTF, neither the Decepticons nore The Fallen were successful in their revenge plot. They all SUCKED. I don't know why I'm ranting about all the flaws with ROTF, even though I liked the movie and I gave it an 7 out of 10. The movie's awesome, but it just has flaws that bothered me A LOT. ROTF is certainly a much bigger movie than the first film, but the first film is certainly better. However, I still enjoyed ROTF and the exhillarating ride that Michael Bay kept me, and the audience, through. PS: Now that the robots talk more, the movie has a lot of cursing/swearing. Do robots really need to swear? Oh, and the parents were back with their comedic selves. Haha, everyone's gotta love the mom! Oh, and there's a lot of dick jokes in the movie. The audience and I saw the giant wrecking balls on the gigantic transformer dude, and we all laughed. Was it really needed? Oh, and NEST stands for Networked Elements: Supporters and Transformers. I wish the freaking movie explained that, so as to not confuse people."

","Every of the new Hollywood movies I have seen recently made an extremely silly impression on me. In that aspect Transformers 2 has been one of the worst. The story is like a children's comic, the dialog is corny and the humor is silly. There is an unbelievable amount of jokes in this movie, yet, I only had to smile a single time. I didn't laugh once. It's almost like in those really bad comedy shows where one bad joke after the other is being pulled out – simply because they ran out of good jokes...<br/><br/>Yet I still liked it. The story felt like the one of a children's comic book. The story is told fast, with a lot of action. And heck, this action is fun to watch - despite all the silliness in the movie. The movie doesn't have a ""realistic"" theme, and doesn't care to be realistic. For me, this makes the whole thing a lot more bearable, and like I said, fun to watch."
"Thomasamills","2","0","5","16 May 2010"," Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen review from a Michael Bay fan.
","I am a film fan who will always defend Michael Bay when he is criticized for being a poor director. My argument has always been, if Hollywood want a action film done as big as possible, Micheal Bay will achieve that. He will get Hollywood the money they want and blow up every car and building which he possibley can in the process. In fact I think Armegedan is a very good film and I am a huge fan of The Island. When I saw Transformers in 2007, I was very pleased with the film. The action was fine, Shia Le Buef was great and it was an overall fun summer blockbuster that kept me entertained. I knew that there would be a sequel and I was right. Unfortunately.<br/><br/>My summary for Transformers: Revenge of the fallen goes like this. Shia Le Buef goes off to college, Megan Fox looks gorgeous, the cube from the first film returns along with John Tatoro and other characters, and robots hit each other. OK, there is more to it then that, but is is not worth going into. The film has so many plot holes that there is just no point what so ever explaining them. Just know that the film does not care for its plot, so why should we.<br/><br/>This film is a case of what some people call sequelitis. The first film did well at the box office, received some good reviews and gained a fan base. OK, thats fine, I have no problem with that, in fact I thought the first film was one of the best summer films of 2007. What has happened here, is that Michael Bay has been given more money to make another film and he has spent all the money on big explosions and action sequences shot so fast, loud and shaky that you end up not having a clue with what is meant to be happening. The film spends no time on character development and even Shia Like Buef who I think is a terrific actor is very poor in the film. There is one scene in which Megan Fox tells him she loves him and he replies I like you too. Oh please. If a guy like him ever got a chance with her, he would not use that as a response to I love you. The problem is that we all know he can act. I was amazed at his performance in Disturbia and then I have to watch him in this peace of rubbish.<br/><br/>The writing is utterly atrocious and just wants to get to the next action sequence. The dialogue is bad and the plot is terrible.It is a script that has clearly not had any care put into it. The only thing the writers were caring about was the money that they would receive when the film has finished. The cast in the film are no different. They are aware that a paycheck is waiting for them and all they have to do is run around a lot. We have more transformers introduced. They are 2D characters that have no purpose there apart from Michael Bay can afford to put them there. They are forgettable and offer nothing to the film.<br/><br/>The film grossed over 300 million at the box office which makes it even more hateful. The fact that a lazy film with a rotten heart that just wants money from the audience and does not want to give the audience anything in return makes it the worst film of 2009 for me. I am now going to refer to how I introduced my review by saying that I defend Michael Bay. I still think that Bay makes action film louder and bigger then any other director, but when placed with a poor script and the directing just consists of crash boom bang, we end up with this hateful film.<br/><br/>I even fell a sleep for a few seconds towards the end of the film. I can't believe it. The film was so mind numbingly boring that a fell a sleep in a Michael Bay film. As you can imagine I was soon woken by a giant explosion of some sort which didn't matter at all to the story. For everyone who was involved in this film, shame on you. You have have got all your millions of dollars from making a horrible excuse for a film."

","What a sad result for such great visuals. I hereby congratulate Michael Bay for his great achievement of ruining this movie since it really requires some talent. Lets start with the actor selection. The only difference between lumber and Shia LaBeouf is Shia LaBeouf can talk. Given this fact, I really don't see any reason for his existence on this (or any other) movie. I mean it, this guy has no talent at all, he doesn't have an attractive physic or anything that can justify his presence in a movie. Also, the female characters made the plot more cheesy and they were totally unnecessary. Lets put some sexy girls and silly jokes to make a teenage movie. Unfortunately it doesn't work like that. I have never seen a classical movie with cheesy plot. Especially in sci-fi, this cheap tricks are just ruining the movie. I don't want to hear a stupid joke when there is an action packed fight scene. If you want to make a remarkable movie, you should be serious (I prescribe the director some James Cameron movies so that he may see how sci-fi is done). The last battle was really great in terms of visuals but overall, there is plenty of room for improvement. It is so sad that the third one will be done by the same director."

All CGI looked very real and there was much work put into the stunts. These two parts never faltered throughout Revenge of the Fallen. What sets this movie apart from the prequel was there wasn't as much of awful character development (Thank goodness).<br/><br/>But still, I couldn't stand hearing any of these actors talk. Anything that comes out of these cardboard goofy characters' mouths were just annoying and just plain insulting. Even the voice overs were annoying. Michael Bay had an excuse to create an erroneous and hard-to-follow story line by placing self absorbed and nonsensical action sequences that bring more explosions and chaos to a deafening level. I was having a hard time following the confusing story line in the middle of it. I watched it today and have a hard time trying to explain what this movie was really about.<br/><br/>Yet still, this is not exactly horrible as I anticipated it. I don't quite recommend it fully, but the CGI and the special effects are probably worth viewing if you have nothing better to do."
"debjyoti1981","4","0","4","4 December 2009"," Where To Start........
","Well in the beginning I was thinking where I should start with.<br/><br/>Having seen the first part 'Transformers' I knew this movie will of course not be the type where lots of grey cells need to be nurtured.<br/><br/>I have always been a fan of Science Fiction movies, but to consider Michael Bay's Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is like making fun of some legendary directors like Steven Spielberg, Steven Soderbergh, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas & of course James Cameron.<br/><br/>Well though I grew up during the time of animated transformers, I had never seen one. So without hurting the feeling of all the hardcore followers of this franchise, my personal outlook on this 2nd sequel is how can we put this title in the shelf of Science Fiction? I enjoyed little bit of the first part only because of the visual effects which was definitely praise worthy. In the beginning of the first movie itself we were told the origin. Whether everyone will agree with me or not, but I feel that the only reason for making ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was for the sake of keeping the franchise alive and to milk as much of money it could have extracted from the box office. I feel hardcore faction of Terminator & Alien Series will agree with me to some extent.<br/><br/>Firstly in the 2nd part way too many new characters were included as such I hardly cared for any one of them. May be I saw this just for some computer generated robots and because of hot ""Megan Fox""....:) The basic plot remains the same, hapless human caught in the war between Autobots and Decepticons. I think by this time almost every one has seen this movie, but for those who have not yet seen, the story in short, its revealed long time back some ancient clan of 'Transformers' moved from universe to universe in search of 'Energon' (Sounded to me like Eragon) sources. In order to do so they used devices called as 'Harvesters' to draw the energy from the stars in order to power ""All Spark"" which I think every one knows had been the central theme of the prequel. Any way these Transformers were called as ""Dynasty of Prime"" who had some principle of their own.funny isn't it (they too had philosophers like we human...)) to spare the planets which had life. Naturally some one has to break this, other wise we will not have the 2nd Part..so we learn one of the member (who will be known as 'Fallen') of this special clan makes one of the Harvester on Earth. So in order to hide the key which drives this device rest of the Prime sacrifices their liferest I think you can pretty well guess what would have followed. Whoa!!! What a storyseems like it will put 'Aliens' even to shame.<br/><br/>When it comes to acting I think there is barely any thing you will notice in CGI Robots who are way too busy kicking each others' ass. Never felt sorry for fallen Autobots because that depth had been missing from the very beginning itself. This movie is simply for those who just like actions without much logic to work on. Though the box office had shown pretty positive market for this sequel, sometimes I feel have the viewers lost the very essence of Science Fiction Movieshopefully Cameron's highly anticipated movie 'AVATAR' will revive this lost genre. I think Spielberg's presence in the production shoes might have helped in boosting the visual effects to some great extent. So to finish with, if some has missed this movie, you can pretty well skip, otherwise you can rent it or download it but truly this does not deserve to be purchased. Rest is up to individuals as everyone's view should be valued after all we all do have diverse taste and it may hold opposing views. Hope you will accept my take on this movie. Well your rating will definitely show cause it."
"Gunn","7","0","2","10 November 2009"," Very Disappointing!
","I am reviewing the DVD version of this sequel to the very clever and wonderful Transformers film. This one is lacking in a lot of things: story, plot, coherence, good dialog and much more. It is utterly confusing at some points, very loud and noisy, the characters are not as endearing as in the first film. I'm getting tired of Shia LaBeouf's rat-a-tat, rambling, improv style of speech. He acts like he's on speed and Megan Fox comes off as a bitchy spoiled brat, Kevin Dunn and Julie White as LaBeouf's parents act idiotic up until towards the end of the film when the seem to ""snap out of it"". There are way too many Transfomers (hint: less is more) and it becomes confusing determining just who's who? The film was terribly paced by director Michael Bay, who comes off on the DVD like some kind of jerk in his attitude. I will say that the effects are good, as are the stunts, but there are way too many. The plot was OK but took forever to unfold. It's not the worst film out there, but it could have been so much better."
"BaronBl00d","4","0","4","8 November 2009"," Desperately Needs a Diet Pill
","Bloated. That is the one word I think accurately describes this cinematic experience. Michael Bay, a director of some talent and a filmmaker with credits like The Rock, Bad Boys, and the first Transformers film, goes out of control here with the special effects and opens one big can of cheese as story, logic, acting, and character development take the back seat - in a bus! The story is so convoluted and so ludicrous that I defy anyone to tell me that he/she really understood all that was going on, because it is clear the director and the actors haven't a clue. There is no way a child sitting through this maze of machines forming, transforming, and uttering ridiculous dialog would be able at any point to tell you what was going on AND why it was going on. That is how little time is devoted to exposition. Odd you might think considering the film is two and a half hours long! I am not one of those people that hates long movies - I only am bothered by them when they feel like long movies. This one felt like three or four hours long. I kept thinking to myself when will this mess end. Look, for those of you wanting to see the special effects. There is no way you will be disappointed. I need more of that. If you want sophomoric dialog, juvenile situations, and Megan Fox in huggingly tight shorts and white jeans - you are in luck too. If you want character acting devoid of logic with Kevein Dunn and Julie White playing Shia's parents like they were in an over-acting concert or Ramon Rodriguez hamming it up with a butt roast rather than slices - then you are in luck. I found few bright spots in this film for me. I need something more than one scene after another of mindless transforming and one-liners meant to be funny to a quasi-literate adolescent. The first film, also directed by Bay, was more of that. It was by no means a great film, but it was entertaining and did spend oodles more time in development of plot and characters. This film tries to feed off that development but fails miserably because those plot elements and characters were not wholly formed. Maybe I am getting all bent out of shape for nothing more than what this film was supposed to be - but I have seen it done better - even by this director who excels in that kind of film. The brightest spots for me were Rainn Wilson in a cameo as a professor with a great opening in a class and John Turturro reprising his role with much less dignity but nevertheless some acting skill."

","How can something as good as the first Transformers lead to something tragic? Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is your answer.<br/><br/>The beginning events of the movie was O.K. starting with flash back and a robotic attack. In those events, we learn that the ""Transformers"" have been on earth since the stone age. We also learn that after the events following Transformers 1, a confidential military group is formed specially to fight off more Decepticon attacks.<br/><br/>The beginning mood was pretty serious... And then we switch over to the scenes of Sam. The mood changes from a good action movie, to a failed attempt of a comedy alike ""Disaster Movie."" The failed attempts to make us laugh were followed by many other pathetically made scenes, and barely followable scenes of metal clashing metal.<br/><br/>As for dialogue, you couldn't ask for any worse. There are life threatening sequences that follow with a child's sense of dialogue. That includes overacting too.<br/><br/>Micheal Bay made the first Transformers excellent, and barely escaped me giving him a 1 star for his sequel."

","I've been a Transformers fan for well over two decades now, grew up with Generation 1, got caught on the recent tide of nostalgia and thoroughly enjoyed Michael Bay's first live action movie, despite the obvious differences from the franchise's first incarnation. Things change, and the movie was a blast. I looked forward to the sequel, hoping for more of the same but with a bigger scope to reflect the growing threat.<br/><br/>Well, more is certainly what we got with Revenge of the Fallen, there's no doubt about that. More robots, more locations, more fight sequences, improved effects. It's all up there on the screen, no doubt about that. The movie looks incredible.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Michael Bay doesn't seem to know when to stop. The movie is a good half hour too long and relentless with it. There are simply too many Transformers on screen now to care about, and the few of them that do receive adequate screen time to get to know tend to be the more grating, comedy relief characters, while the potentially more interesting Transformers are relegated to the background.<br/><br/>Oh yes, the 'comedy'. There's way too much of it, and it's faaaaar too juvenile in nature. Jokes about stoned mothers, Transfomers showing their 'affection' for their new human friends, Devastator's swinging wrecking balls... I must admit the odd snigger, but felt quite ashamed with myself for it. This kind of stuff is just out of place, making it seem like giant shape-shifting robots have wandered onto the set of the latest instalment of the interminable American Pie series. And as for those twins...<br/><br/>A shame, because there is good stuff here. The core Transformers from the previous film remain and work well for the time they have on screen (save Bumblebee, who seems to have turned into Sam's stalker). Megatron and Starscream's relationship is expanded and works brilliantly. The human cast work well, particularly Shia LaBeouf , Josh Duhamel and John Turturro, whose comedy relief character DOES work. Soundwave is perfect as a sinister puppet master, keeping a close eye on things from space. And Ravage is simply brilliant.<br/><br/>Despite slight disappointment, I'm still looking forward to the third in the series. Just know when to hold back next time, eh Mr. Bay...?"
"stealth4933","5","0","4","17 October 2009"," Made me Mad
","I saw this movie the weekend after I saw Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, and they were both, by far, the most hyped up movies of the summer. Well if you've read my Harry Potter review, then you know my feelings towards that film. My feelings towards this one is perhaps even worse. In all fairness, I entered this movie with the promise that it was ""even better than the Dark Knight"" from one of my friends. The first thing that didn't make sense is the premise that the government somehow smoothed over the final scene in the last movie. It was one of the biggest cities in the world, packed with people. It is NOT POSSIBLE to erase a giant robot battle from every person New Yorks mind. I guess they borrowed the giant mind eraser that the men in black kept in their basement? The next thing I did not like was how they portrayed Megan Fox. SHES HOT, WE KNOW. The very first scene has her straddling a motorcycle, completely unnecessarily I might mention. But the thing that took the cake, that totally floored me, and made me openly laugh at the movie screen was when they find the old robots. You know the ones that were apparently hiding in Petra for billions of years and we did not notice. Forget all the research weve made on the place, we somehow missed three giant robots inside it. But no, the story didn't stop there, no, the director decided to take it one step further and say there was a giant ray gun in the pyramids of giza. You mean to tell me that one of the most studied and oldest structures in the whole world was actually made to house a GIANT LASER and we never noticed it? This movie is definitely not as bad as im making it sound, Im just venting the anger and exasperation that I fealt after I had to watch Harry Potter and this two weekends in a row. People should see it, but make sure they have 3 loooooong hours to spare (no joke it is about 2 and a half hours long). And I would not recommend, healthwise, that people should watch this and Half Blood Prince back to back."

","OK, I finally have to sit through this movie... What can I say beside two and half hours of my life wasted? What is wrong with this movie? Oh where do I start? First of all there is no real plot here. They go for one way, then turn it upside-down to another subplot. Some things that seem like a plot element are never mentioned again. One of the examples is that Matrix Cube part (or whatever it's called) where Desepticons search for it. After that, it's never heard or seen again.<br/><br/>Movie is filled with funny lines and humor. Wait, WHAT HUMOR? Every thing that happens on screen has to be fallowed by one lazy one-liner. Bay, it just doesn't work. It's terrible and it just kills the scene. Now, you will think that man of Michael Bay's age would finally grow up and stop inserting FART JOKES in the scrip. Yeah, you've heard me right, we had to see two robots FART. Now, isn't that funny? Was that sarcasm coming from my mouth? I don't know. There are lot of more stupid scenes like that during the whole movie. One of them is at very end. You'll know it when you see it.<br/><br/>Now... Since Terminator 4 was coming out, Michael Bay thought it would be interesting to put one Terminator in his movie. No joke, there is one and it's not Kristinna Loken. Few more random Gremlin robots are also presented.<br/><br/>Then along the way came the acting... Megan Fox? Shia LaBeouf? Who you are kidding? Megan Fox has one of her emotional moments at the end that would even make Jean Claude Van Damme embarrassed. There should be subtitle ""Megan Fox is so emotional right now"" so you can actually see it's emotional scene. Funny thing is that she complained how Bay movies are all about FX and Action... Well Megan, if we were watching long scene where you have dialog with Shia, it would be equal to watching two Bonsai Tree talking. Enough Megan, just please shut up.<br/><br/>Visuals are well done but that's the only thing that's good about this movie. Of course, it's Michael Bay movie and everything is filled with light effects, explosions in every damn scene and shaky cam and you can't see what happens on the screen most of the time, but it's still a good movie, right? Sarcasm again? No? And why every robot, Desepticon or Autobot in this movie is gray? (except Prime and BB?). They look like Matrix robot rejects or like someone made them in their back junkyard.<br/><br/>There's no plot, no character development, you just don't care who lives or dies, even if it's a main character, just bad corny one-liners and fart jokes.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 just because movie production is well done, visuals are good. CGI robots were best actors in the movie anyway."

","I was never a fan of Shia LeBeouf...in the first movie, he was irritating. In this sequel, in my opinion better than the first, he is still the source of my lasting headache. I spent most of the film wishing he would just SHUT UP!! As if his deplorable and amateurish over-acting wasn't bad enough, they added a second contender, in the presence of Ramon Rodriguez, his room-mate. It's really is too much for words...the yammering, jabbering rubbish. LeBeouf screams his way wide-eyed, through nearly 2 and a half hours of film. I can forgive the bad campus, all-American images...I mean, this is Hollywood. We can even get over the fact that the US is deemed to be the arbiter of the entire world security (after Bush, there is little that would surprise me) but while we don't expect much in the way of intellectual stimulation, couldn't the crippling hysterics of the first film be addressed at least? Please, if there are any more sequels, kill LeBeouf's character or make him otherwise silent and PLEASE don't replace him with anymore screamingly BAD actors. John Torturro at least improved slightly from last time but still.... *sigh* I guess after these catastrophic decisions are made (cast, lines, etc.), the enormous budget they spend means that they don't DARE watch the final product for fear of seeing how bad their mistakes were."

","When we went the second time to watch the movie, at this time, it was not so exciting as it was watching the first Transformers. Here they were just too many robots without any introductions. They was too much time given for the vehicles to get converted to autobots. As for the villain robots, they didn't take so much time to convert themselves. Too much time was given Megan Fox to look pretty, too!! Anyway, i watched movie and then tried forgetting about it, that's it. It was not that great a movie as i thought it would be. What to watch out in the movie is Optimus Prime!! The other thing that i like is the action sequence in the Deserts, there is something about the director and the desert sequence, since even the last time, when eh was working on this movie, his opening sequence was in the desert. It just reminds me of one of my favourite movie Mummy.<br/><br/>Coming back to Optimus Prime, he is the heart and soul of the movie, at least that i what i want to believe, but then you have the human characters Shia LeBouf. How does he get all these roles - Transformers, Indiana Jones, all big budget movies.<br/><br/>I love Magatron, too.

","I saw Transformers 2 after I saw Harry Potter & the Half-Blood Prince. Despite Potter 6's $1/2 billion dollar international take on opening weekend, Transformers 2 is the better movie! Shia LaBeouf is a much better actor. He receives and delivers better lines than an insipid Daniel Radcliffe. I suspect the next Harry Potter is the end of his serious acting career. Yet Megan is a Fox! Her overt beauty and ""never get dirty"" tight white jeans dominates the movie. As an adult, I prefer the outright sexuality of Megan Fox to the silly childish crushes of teenagers that never kiss.<br/><br/>Potter 6 squanders a cast rich with talent, while Transformers 2 milks a few nobodies. Although they never have any lines worth repeating, Transformers uses the compassion of Tyrese Gibson, John Turturro and Kevin Dunn to advance the tale of humans caught between a battle of advanced alien robots. Potter 6 however, kills off Michael Gambon (Dumbledore) and practically ignores the talents of Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Helena Bonham Carter and the slithery Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>Plus, the direction and action of Transformers 2 is better. And its stupid plot twists are just as believable as the magic that infuses Potter. Alien robots that never die is just as believable as evil wizards that never die. In both movies the special computer effects make the entire movie. In Potter, computer generated images create the Hogwarts castle with its rich architecture. In Transformers, CGI creates a mess of metal clashes as robot battles robot. In both, the repetitious computer generated pattern wears the eye down, making the CGI seem like it goes on forever. To its credit, Transformers seems to have a lot more on site scenery with locations in New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Arizona, California, Egypt, Paris and Jordan.<br/><br/>Potter was like a magic potion; I wanted to sleep through its poetically slow tale. Transformers 2 was a classic ""bang bang shoot em up,"" with high tech weapons. Much easier for me to enjoy. I can't say Transformers 2 is good enough to spend your lunch money on to see it in the theater, but I think only Harry Potter fans should rent this franchise's sixth release. <br/><br/>Suspend belief. Ignore the faults. This is no Spiderman. This is Terminator meets Gremlins. Sit back, enjoy."

"jerekra","4","0","4","8 August 2009"," Disappointing.
","Going into seeing Transformers Revenge of the Fallen I had higher expectations than any film that I had ever seen before. I was disappointed with how many flaws were in this film.<br/><br/>Basically the decepticons snatch the all spark and use it to bring Megatron back to life. THey then plan on uncovering a device that is capable of destroying suns. In a nut shell, pretty much that is the main conflict.<br/><br/>I was hoping to see a lot of new transformers in this film. Sideswipe was a really cool new autobot in this film, but he is barely in it for more than a minute. Arcee seemed cool, but she is barely in it. The two main new autobots in the film are skids and mudflap who are easily two of the most annoying characters in film history. Seriously, could not stand them. The talked like they were from the hood and did nothing at all except annoy the hell out of me.<br/><br/>Most of the main autobots from the first film are not in this film nearly enough. Even Prime has a very small role which is inconceivable. What were they thinking? Also for the most part in this film I think there are way too many human scenes and the humans seem too important. It was never like that on the show, sure there were humans around, but it was the transformers who were most important.<br/><br/>Having to watch a film titled tranformers, and have to see humans for the most part was disappointing. I wanted to see a lot of new transformers and lots of transformers scenes and it did not satisfy me enough in either regard.<br/><br/>The humor is very lame as well. THere are a lot of weird sexual jokes though out the film. It just made the film seem like a teen comedy and not a transformer film.<br/><br/>The action was OK, but once again it was hard to tell at times who was winning and who was who.<br/><br/>The film is not all bad though. I loved Soundwave and Ravage in this film. Both were awesome, although not in the film nearly enough. Megatron was cool once again, and so was Starscream. Devastator looked awesome(besides a certain part of his anatomy being present) but he did not do anything that cool.<br/><br/>One more thing, the idea of Megatron having to answer to someone else in the Decepticon ranks is pretty impossible and unthinkable if you ask me. Just saying.<br/><br/>So, while someone who may enjoy lame humor and pointless action may like this film, a true G1 Transformer Fan like myself did not. I do not recommend this film."

One good thing was the soundtrack and or song by Linkin Park that was one of the best songs for a soundtrack ever. I doubt Michael bay even saw or researched transformers before making these two movies he just glimpsed and ran with the movie production. Like Chinese director for Hulk supposed to be Incredible Hulk he knew nothing about it , we know how that turned out, this is a little better , but eerily similar in how it turns out in some ways.

"ozymandiaskingofkings","6","0","3","5 August 2009"," Disappointment with a side of racism
","This should have been so good. I love Transformers, I like Michael bay films, I thought the first film was great. What could possibly go wrong? Well, as it happens, a hell of a lot. ROTF labours under the false pretence that more is more, so rather than taking time to set up a complex and (for a Bay film at least) intelligent story as the first film did, this film just presents us with a mixture of massive explosions, cynical fan-boy box ticking (such as a blink-and-you-miss-it sideswipe cameo) and, worst of all, casual racism. Before I address this specifically, I'll start with the few positives.<br/><br/>The film looks great, some of the set pieces are jaw-dropping and Shia LaBouf, Megan Fox and John Turturro all do very well with severely underwritten roles. There are some fan favourites that work great as well. Devestator, is all his constructicon glory, is jaw-dropping, while Soundwave and Ravage's infiltration of a government laboratory is heart poundingly exciting. Jetfire's reinvention as a cranky old war vet is inspired, though not all purists may see it that way. And the climatic battle between the autobots and decepticons which culminates in the destruction of the great pyramid is awesome. Fan favourites from the last film are also given a little more to do this time around. Megatron and Starscream bicker like they do in the cartoon and Ironhide gets to kick a lot of ass. The problems come with the new additions to the cast.<br/><br/>Lets start with The Fallen shall we? Trailers made him look totally evil, a massive teleporting rogue agent which the autobots and decepticons have to team up to defeat. Not so, The Fallen is actually a rubbish, less charismatic, replacement for Megatron with a moronic plan to destroy the sun. He doesn't appear in the film that much and when he does you find yourself wondering why Megatron doesn't just rip him apart. He's the weakest link in what is a completely uninspired plot, a formulaic chase for a McGuffin called the ""matrix of leadership"".<br/><br/>However, The Fallen is merely disappointing whereas two new additions called The Twins are just really offensive. First of all, with their Ghetto accents, Ape-like builds and big gold teeth, they are racial stereotypes so extreme they make Jar Jar Binks look like an accurate representation of Jamaican culture. They also use the words ""bitch"", ""pussy"" and ""ass"" frequently in what is meant to be a kids movie. Why the hell they were included is a mystery, but for some reason someone somewhere decided Transformers, a SCI-FI ACTION film, needed more comic relief. So we get dogs humping, Sam's mum high on weed, a pervy robot trying to shag Megan Fox's leg and numerous other cringeingly unfunny Adam Sandler esquire moments that slow down the film and just don't belong here.<br/><br/>There is also a lot more sexual content than the last film, and while I myself enjoy the sight of Megan Fox straddling a motorcycle and running on slow-motion, I wouldn't have spent more time focusing on it than the plot. There is also a seen where a decepticon disguised as a cheerleader makes out with Sam wearing only a thong. Yes, you did just read that sentence.<br/><br/>Now, the sex and the swearing is fine, but this is a film based on a kids cartoon and kids toys, and I really don't feel great about kids watching a tirade of casual racism/sexism.<br/><br/>In fact, I don't know how to rate this film at all. The last Transformers film I loved, gave a 9/10. This one was good in parts, the ending was brilliant but the build up was boring, and staggered with misjudged comedy and inappropriately Un-PC humour. And even the geekgasms awarded by Starscream, Ravage and Devestator cannot undo the sheer hate I feel for the twins."

","I have to admit I am not part of the target demographic as I don't have any testosterone. I am a fan of the original cartoon, when I heard about the first one I was excited to see the autobots! But it was a bit too much with the human element and the military, what action movie doesn't entail the military these days.<br/><br/>The first one was a bore because it spent too much time on the human characters, the sexual tension was there for guys and nothing more.<br/><br/>OK, I went into the ""revenge of the fallen"" with mild expectations and it was bittersweet. I liked the fact that the autobots and deceptacons got more screen time. C'mon, this is a ""Transformers"" movie so expect a lot of robots and some action. There are a lot of big explosions, Peter Cullen who is the voice of Optimus Prime is really who carried this movie.<br/><br/>What I didn't expect was the crude sexual innuendos, profanity and utter lack of depth of the script. Apparently Michael Bay made this movie for males between teenagers, or the same target audience as ""Step Brothers"".<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the 80's cartoon go in with low expectations you won't be disappointed.

"AdderCowley","5","0","4","3 August 2009"," Dumb blockbuster which smashes its audience over the head with a brick of CGI effects, stereotypes and incoherent action.
","Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is an absolute brain-dead, action packed spectacle which to only the simplest of minds would be an ordeal rather than entertainment. Put simply it's dumb.<br/><br/>The actual movie starts out fine, a sumptous fight scene in Shanghai essentially introduces the war between the Autobots/Humans and the evil Decepticons. After this impressive spectacle it goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>Once you look beyond the special effects (which of course are excellent) there really is so little to feed off, I was literally stunned for 2 1/2 hours (its duration). There are so many things that annoyed me that I was almost laughing ironically every time something happened, by the end because it was all so predictable.<br/><br/>Bigger does not mean better. This was the biggest problem for the film and the reason why the first was so much better as it was far more understated. Revenge of the Fallen claimed to be bigger than the last with bigger fight scenes and more robots. True there is more fighting in this instalment but it all seems so pointless after 2 1/2 hours of watching the same boring trash and unfunny material.<br/><br/>Furthermore we barely see anything of the new robots or indeed the old ones because of the increased number of 'characters' from a dozen to 40. Many of the new intriguing characters such as Soundwave were barely used because the writers couldn't balance out the film between 40 odd robots, even at nearly 3 hours. Also the transformers that do get some screen time didn't seem believable. Only Jazz would say ""Punk-ass decepticon"" for example and certainly not Ironhide and Optimus Prime, there is no continuity.<br/><br/>Another major problem of this films was its handling of stereotypes. I mean who green lighted the twins? Somebody needs to go and have a serious chat with them about the way the world works. ""We don't - we don't really do much reading""- Surely a quote which perfectly describes this dump pile of a movie. Some of the banter is funny, most of it isn't and some of it is disturbingly bad. While the twins were depressingly bad, megan fox's character , who is introduced draped over a motorbike in very short shorts, I mean really short, is just depressing.<br/><br/>Sure it made the 10 year olds behind me hoot with joy but seeing it filled me with sadness that not since Return of the Jedi had we seen such a despicable depiction of a person in a kids film. What was more worrying was this wasn't in order to show the vile nature of a villain but as a form of entertainment for 12 year olds.<br/><br/>Talking of 12 year olds, the toilet Humour was consistent, unfunny and often rather ferocious in its assault. Humping gags were repeated on several different animals (and robots), b*****k jokes were used and I'm pretty sure Megan Fox dropped the F-Bomb at some point. Toilet humour is never funny so why constantly repeat them? At least in the first film the transformers didn't reach this level and weren't spitting at the humans, trying to 'come on' to them and probe them with tentacles coming from their backsides. While the first film was hardly subtle it didn't bludgeon us with a stick like ROTF.<br/><br/>As one would expect the acting and script were non-existent. Jon Voight, the only actor with any reputation has wisely departed and has left a huge acting void.<br/><br/>But who needs actors when you have huge CGI robots and explosions lighting up the screen?. Never has a movie had so little plot and yet been so hard to follow. Watching it was almost like watching two films about robots which had two different scripts as events seem to have no relevance or link to each other.<br/><br/>Huge plot devices are used such as prototype lasers destroying devastator, jet-fire destroying himself to upgrade Optimus Prime, and a random piece of the cube (first film) activating and destroying Sam's House. Utterely random, incoherent rubbish happens in this film that I was almost left stunned by its idiocy. And finally what was the point of the Mexican kid? Despite all these criticisms however one thing about this film that I admire is the effort which has been put into the CGI. I don't mind a lot of CGI (I'm a fan of Star Wars for god's sake) and I really admire the effort that was put into making the films CGI creations look real. They do and you can where the £200 Million budget went, clearly on effects.<br/><br/>Also the music was excellent. Steve Jablonsky certainly knows how to compose an effective score and his music often lifted the film to at least an acceptable level of emotion. Indeed his music arguably makes the forest battle scene which is probably the best scene in the film because of its raw emotion However as usual visuals are no match for good story telling and Transfomers : Revenge of the Fallen falls way short of that mark."

","People thought Quantum of Solace was disappointing? Well, they probably haven't seen Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen yet. Transformers: Revnge of the Fallen has so many flaws. I won't even tell you the plot because I don't know what plot there is. The plot is incomprehensible. The film has an unbearable length. Within the third hour I was ready for suicide.I would give it a 6/10 if it wasn't for that unbearable length. Michael Bay has done many critical flops. Like Bad Boys II, Pearl Harbor, and Armegeddon.i've only liked two of his films. I liked the original Transformers film and Bad Boys. But I think that after seeing great films like Transformers and Bad Boys, it's very sad to see bad sequels. I hope Harry potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the number one film of the year. Because it doesn't disappoint. It will actually blow you away and dazzle you. This film lacks the imagination and humor that the first film had. it was a real disappointment.<br/><br/>Transformers:Revenge of the fallen:* out of ****"
"lndkramer","6","0","3","25 July 2009"," Not the first at all
","OK, so I'm a bit late, but I just watched Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen. I wasn't as excited to see it as everyone else, but still wanted to. And it reached the expectations I had for it. <br/><br/>I was happy right from the start when the robots were fighting in China. Great action, slow mo shots, fast chases. That's what an action movie is about. Unfortunately, the movie did not stay that way.<br/><br/>I was happy to see the origins and backstory behind the Transformers. It was actually interesting. But they dragged it out as much as they could. This caused the film to be about three hours long. The other main problem I had was that the robot fights were few and far between. I don't want to watch people run from robots the whole movie. I want to see good robots kill bad robots. Duh.<br/><br/>I was also scratching my head about a few things: -You can't even take a tube of toothpaste on a plane. How do you get a robot in a box on board? -Why does she fly 3000 miles to go see her Sam but his parents drove him to college in what seemed like 20 minutes? -Why do all of the Transformers suddenly know how to curse and do it quite frequently? -Why do the Decepticons disguise themselves as cars when they can turn into humans? Michael Bay must have wanted to make a Terminator movie. We could see it coming a mile away. Stupid. -If ""The Fallen"" was so great and powerful and you're gonna amp us up for this epic battle, then why does Optimus Prime hop right up from his deathbed and rip his face open without breaking a sweat? I was hoping that wasn't the end but oh well.<br/><br/>The robots fighting is what everyone wants to see. They spent too much time on the story and trying to fit in over the top slapstick comedy in stupid places and not enough time on good ol' fashioned action. Great looking movie, fun enough to watch, but not as magic as the first one at all."

","Can you take a movie seriously in which alien robots can transform into cars or planes? I can't. Transfomers 2 is supposed to be an entertaining summer popcorn movie and nothing more. It's made for the masses to make a hell of money. Good acting is not needed. Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox are the young attractive couple which is fighting with the good Transformers versus the bad Transformers. Both are shining and part of the pleasure. I enjoyed seeing Jon Torturro again as crazy former Agent. There is a lot of plenty CGI Action in it and typical for Michael Bay Explosions en mass. The Humor, Dialogues and Plot are made that everybody round the world can easily follow it. It's more difficult to find out which transformer is fighting against whom as to understand the movie. Not the best flick ever but it's a simple escape to a fantasy world. Turn off your brain and enjoy this piece of entertainment."

","Transformers 2: Revenge of the Fallen was okay. It wasn't great, and it wasn't horrible. I don't have much to say on it, except that... it was very graphic, lots of random fighting where you can't really make out who is who... there were many unexplained moments... and the acting was so-so. The plot was also a little tired, but I guess that is just my own opinion--I mean, how many times can you have a robot-fighting movie? Seems kind of cliché, doesn't it? Just like action movies... you watch 'em once, great! You watch 'em again... eh. And if they make a sequel? Gag. Because the FUN in an action movie is not knowing what happens next. So Transformers 2... was a little obvious. So my overall view? It was good, but unless you are DYING to see it, don't wast your money: wait until it comes out on DVD."

"JavierAndres92","Null","0","3","22 July 2009"," Very entertaining and excellent effects, but the story is very weak.
","I said that I didn't want to lose again a Transformsers movie in the big screen, because when I saw the first one on DVD I wish I have seen it in the cinema, so for the second I went directly the opening weekend to see it. First i'm gonna talk about the special effects. They're excellent, and better than the first, I was seeing the first movie yesterday and I noted the difference. They can't be so good!, they're very well made, with everything as it should be, with the reflects, lights, everything. The great but great problem in Transformers 2 is it's script, because it has it's predecessor's problems multiplied by five. I'm not gonna say that this movie is bad, I would be lying because it entertains a lot, but I can say that the story is weak. Besides there are very bad solved things, or sometimes dialogs are unbearable of listening because they area meaningless or they are not well located, or because the actors scream all together and you can't understand nothing. There are a lot of unnecessary things, starting with two or three characters such us Alicia (I think the actress was beautiful and very sexy but if they wanted to catch Sam they would sent a big robot and solved problem), the stupid and unbearable Leo, or Galloway. NEST is okay, but it could have been shorter without making it so hard. Other Things: Sam's parents should have had less importance and time, because they don't reach anything to the story, only annoying noise, specially the mother. The final is kind of confusing because they go from a place to another as if everything was at 1 meter long and a lot of things are left with no cohesion or not understood. And the sort of Sam's ""Spiritual experience "" is very unnecessary. Out of all these things, the movie entertains big and I think that's most important to people. There's action form the beginning to the end, very well achieved and entertaining pursuits. If Michael Bay knows to do something is filming action sequences, with his movements he does spectacular things. I want to stand out the forest fights that are very good. And, in the end, World War 3 develops. Bombs, giants robots, planes, tanks, shoots, infinite spectacular explosions. This is very entertaining. Also the very first scene is very entertaining. There's a very good photography job with very good pictures (such us the picture when you can see a helicopter up Megan Fox)and the sounds are wonderful, it's a thousand of faces sound party. Shia LaBeouf is still lovable and has the face for blockbusters, and gives another funny and likable performance. Megan Fox poor me! She's pleasure to see, and cracks the screen every time she's in it, indeed. She's better than as she was in the first, she has more protagonism and she has improved. The rest of the actors are good, the only thing is what I've already said about Sam's parents and Turturro who has to calm down a bit and talk slowly and not look like a crazy man. Finally, Transformers 2 succeeds i entertaining very very good giving incredible entertaining action sequences with excellent effects, but if it had a better script and a more coherent story it would have been a LOT better. <br/><br/>Sorry if my English is bad.<br/><br/>TRANSFORMERS 2 REVENGE OF THE FALLEN 6/10"

","Let's start with the highlights: <br/><br/>Pros: - Great action – Awesome graphics <br/><br/>Cons: - Awkward scenes – Stretches of bad dialog – Weak plot – Plot holes<br/><br/>If you like great action and fast-paced scenes and are very forgiving of weak plot you should enjoy this movie. But let's go through some of my gripes anyway (SPOILERS): <br/><br/><ul><li>The commander of NEST also commanded the base that was attacked at the beginning of the first one and should have been killed there. - The Helicopter Decepticon (Blackout I think) was killed during the city fight in the first movie and was never shown to be resurrected yet was back fighting again. Also I think there were a few others that could have sworn had been killed in the first one. - Sam and his gang found the Matrix artifact in about a day whereas advanced alien robots couldn't find it in hundreds of years. - The transforming college girl was unnecessary. - Sam's high mother was unnecessary. - The Decepticons kidnapping Sam's parents and bringing them to Egypt seems incredibly random and useless even when it was part of some ""trap."" - Anti-Climatic super villains: The Devastator and The Fallen barely did anything. </li></ul><br/><br/>But this movie is what it is it was exactly what I expected from a Bay sequel (i.e. Bad Boys II). It had a similar issue as X-Men United; could have been an awesome sequel then tried to do too much and made itself mediocre. If about 30-40 minutes of all that pointless dialog and mini-scenes were cut out it would have made the movie flow so much better. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts – What I expected for a Transformers sequel. Sam, Optimus, and Bumblebee carried the movie. Great Action. High Entertainment to Attention-paying ratio."

I love it how a lot of transformer characters (mainly Autobots) still have the original voice actor of the 80's cartoon series. It's a really nice touch.<br/><br/>The CGI is amazing and I was blown away by it. Some say it's overused in this movie, but this IS a movie about giant, fighting, transforming robots. It would be hard to see this film without any CGI, if you ask me.<br/><br/>The acting of the human characters was nice and I wasn't annoyed by anyone. Lots of humor in this movie as well. There's all kinds of humor in here. Ranging from dumb puns to silly gags to some sexual humor, even with the transformers.<br/><br/>It wasn't the best movie I've seen in the past few months, but certainly enjoyable.

As for the transformers, well I couldn't differentiate who were the good guys from the bad, too much chrome! Sometimes they all seem to be bundled together that I didn't know who was who. The fight scenes & the computer effects were great. The humor was good and you can't beat the main character, perfect actor for the part.

The action in this movie has taken special effects to a whole new level. This is definitely worth watching in the cinema.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* The only problem that I could point out is the end, in other words, the movie was stretched at every opportunity to lead to an ending that was too abrupt. I came out of the cinema thinking ''wow! that was some crazy action, but the dude died too fast''.<br/><br/>In comparison to the first Transformers film, I personally think that the first one was better story wise, but action-wise... revenge is far superior in every way possible."
"ahifi","6","0","3","15 July 2009"," Clumsy and cheesy with hints of brilliance
","I found the first Transformers movie to be a very good action flick. It found the right balance between the human and Autobot stories. Yet here, we get treated to a teen movie with the Transformers taking a support role. It's really grating and the first part of the movie is just terrible.<br/><br/>Mid-movie, it starts to come together yet we still get dragged into this stupid love story. It really starts to come together when John Turturro makes an appearance. He's a wonderful actor and is a funny counterpart to Shia LaBeouf - who is pretty woeful up until that point. Megan Fox feels lifeless through-out and is there purely for male fantasy purposes - no surprises there. While both LaBeouf and Fox have little to work with, they don't ever try to excel in their roles either.<br/><br/>Going into the last act, we finally get treated to what we all wanted to see. It's pretty wonderful to watch it all unfold and will satisfy the true fans to some degree, but it by no means saves an average action flick.<br/><br/>I'm not sure if the kids will like it. It's a weird one. It has violence and swearing that I would not expose a child to. Yet the theatre was full of them...it really doesn't seem to know if it's doing the whole adult thing or if it's aimed at the kids. It really is detrimental.<br/><br/>I was expecting more from this sequel. The music is nice, the graphics are awesome and some of the shots we are treated to are delightful. Yet poor editing rears its ugly head at times, both in terms of errors and the tempo at which it moves; it often feels disjointed.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's okay. This isn't must-see stuff and I don't think young kids should be exposed to the language and violence nor should it be aimed at them in the way that it is done.<br/><br/>Transformers fans won't get much out of this either. But the final act made all the terrible build-up worthwhile. 6/10"

Not enough for the amount of time dedicated to it, anyway.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments, but mostly there's action. When the movie moves away from the action to try and build a story line, it's weak. Especially entertaining to me are the Transformers' lines. For the most part...cheeeeesy. Particularly when Fallen is involved. His request for revenge is somewhat unimportant to the movie. It seems to be a vehicle who's only use is to give a reason for all the Transformers to fight.<br/><br/>Most telling to me was when my 16 year-old cousin turns to me 2/3s of the way through the movie and says ""You know, this really isn't doing anything for me."" Me either.<br/><br/>Like many reviews I've seen, it's an assault on the senses. There's so much action and noise for so long that it's almost not worth it. It's like having a hot dog with so much ketchup on it you can't taste anything else. IMO, Star Trek was much better...and I can't WAIT for Harry Potter. Revenge's record for 3-day haul will most certainly 'fall'...pardon the pun.<br/><br/>4 out of 10 because of the CGI. That's it."

","This movie gets a 6 from me for gratuity, poor story, and robot lips! In the first one, the general action had somewhat of a purpose throughout, and was more of a family-oriented movie reminiscent of the cartoon a toy franchise, but this offering delivered a weaker story where the action was more nonsensical and purposeless at times; the Megan Fox was just as hot as in the first, but was more ""sexed up"" in this one. In the first, the character was created to make a testosterone-prevalent ""guy flick"" more inclusive and watchable by girlfriends dragged to the movie. However I'm not sure why she was in this one. The parents, who were supposed to be the ""very irritating"" comic relief in the first, were an unnecessary, unwelcome addition to the movie. <br/><br/>Mudflap and Skidmark or whatever his name is, the two bots who transform into a neurotic ice cream truck were flamboyant and racially stereotypical -- much like that Jar-Jar joke --, but weren't a big part of the story, so weren't as intolerable as most. <br/><br/>The Sound was impressive as was the CGI and FX, but the addition of curse words was silly and extreme at times!

Relentless action sequences (with the side effect of destroying the last of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). This is a teenage movie series, and we stepped in, forewarned of the same, and got everything that we might have expected. The question is – did this movie lift the franchise to a higher level? Did it lend character to Optimus Prime the way it clearly sought to do. Did you want to make up our minds about whether humans should be taking sides in an extraterrestrial battle, or whether the Autobots should be sharing their military technology with humans.

When coming to watch this movie I expected to see cool alien robots, intense fighting scenes, amazing graphics and Megan Fox. Michael Bay and company did wonderfully in fulfilling these requirements, but the problem is they also added lots of useless subplot, bad jokes and too many minor characters. <br/><br/>Acting was spotty at times, but heavily integrating a romance into the movie was extremely ineffective and lame. The minor characters are a waste of time other than a handful of scenes where they actually do something useful. There are new robots which I suppose are to make it seem more like a war rather than just a small feud, but they are poorly integrated and do not have interesting backgrounds or purposes.

I'll keep this short and sweet with a list of pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/><ul><li>3 hours in an air conditioned dark room. - Energy drink I snuck in. - The ceiling of the theater looked pretty cool. - Going to bed that night and waking up not even remembering Transformers until someone at work brought it up.</li></ul><br/><br/>Cons: - Megan Fox: She tries to look hot and bothered even during the running for her life/survival sequences. She squirms in her seat and bites her lip like a teenage girl on a date with the most popular boy in school. Her acting is reminiscent of late night Showtime soft-core. - Shia guy: ""BUMBLEBEEEEEEEEE!!!!"" He screams and clips out his post-production microphone. Can this guy please be removed from Hollywood? Wasn't he on Nickelodeon or part of the Mickey Mouse club or something? His character in this movie is worthy of casting him in a possible ""License 2 Drive II"" - Devastator getting shot by a 'railgun' on a ship... just conveniently in some body of water within viewing distance from the Great Pyramid. Wow, great way to end a 20-30 minute character introduction/buildup. Get some guy to make a cell-phone call and prank the US Navy into shooting a robot with an experimental weapon. Wow. - Every action sequence. I think Michael Bay might be far-sighted. The first full-body shot of any of the transformers in an action sequence happened to be like 1-1/2 hours into the movie. As much as I love watching random appendages flying across the screen at light-speed with car-brand logos hidden on them, I think I'd rather stare at the back of the persons head in front of me. - Consistent product placement. Do I need to explain this one? - The ""Comedy"" relief of the movie - Epic fail. I don't care about Shia's parents from the get-go. I'm pretty sure his mom was reading her lines off an index card in her hand at one point. Im not even joking. - Human-robot-transformer-girl-with-tongue. Nuff said. - About 3 hours long. Think of Lord of the Rings, but subtract all things cool and worthwhile. That's a pretty good summary of Transformers 2. - The fact that people are calling this ""T2"". There's a T2 that exists already. It just so happens to be a movie Michael Bay didn't get to touch: Hence why it's the most highly appraised action movie in the industry. - Tyrese"

The special effects are excellent but once you have seen one robot fight you've seen them all and the sound of machine guns and robot noise for two and a half hours isn't very pleasant. Megan Fox is looking good but the scene with her in hot pants and when her titties are bouncing are both included in the trailer. May I suggest just watching the trailer - it has a transformer fight, some explosions, Megan Fox and some good special effects all wrapped into a minute or two, there is no need to stretch it out to 2.5 hours.<br/><br/>200 Million dollars this cost.

","Its amazing how big budget movies can often fail on the little things that make a good film and great movie.<br/><br/>That is where this movie suffers-on the little things.<br/><br/>On the positive, the special effects, robot battles and new Autobots and Decepticons were great. The introduction of The Fallen, Constructicons(who form Devastator)and Jetfire being my personal favourites(bearing in mind Jetfire was one of my favourites from the 80's cartoon).<br/><br/>On the negative some of the acting(by the humans that is) was terrible. Screen time given to eye candy that has no acting talent(Isabel Lucas for example)instead of being focused on what fans want to see-robots fighting. The human story lines in between had a very familiar feel about them, seen many times before from various movies over the last 10-20 years. The introduction of the Fallen was ruined by the sudden departure(when you see the movie you will know what i mean). The ""wrecking ball"" testicles on Devastator stupid and not needed. The battle scenes arrive and depart too quickly. And i could go on, and on.<br/><br/>To summarise this movie suffers because it tries too hard to do too much. Its 5 movie types in one. This will probably divide the main stream cinema audience from the die hard fan of the Transformers franchise. While most will walk away satisfied with what they have been presented, a good percentage will walk away feeling like they have been cheated by something that promised so much but delivered so little. While both sides will have varying views on the movies they will inevitably come to the same conclusion-the sequel was not as good as the first film.<br/><br/>And all because of the little things.

And since i am a true and loyal Hans Zimmer fan, i of course, loved the score of his student Steve Jablonsky. <br/><br/>So after all i was looking forward to see ROF. I was hoping for some new music themes, and i thought maybe we can find a plot this time. <br/><br/>Well it actually didn't turn out to be like that. The plot is just... i dunno. It just makes no sense. I mean why would Sam give a piece of the All Spark, he suddenly finds, give to his girlfriend. ? I mean why?? There is no reason. It just makes no sense. The Action is OK. Of course the CGI is amazing, but what does it do good, when you just don't get anything of it, because it is too fast, too much, and too big?!?! The Jokes are funny. But In order to laugh about them, you must be able to forget, they are telling a story what should make some sense. If you can forget that, then you can laugh about the jokes. What really pisses me is the score. I don't know what their problem was. whether they didn't want to spend more money on the soundtrack or is it because Steve was lazy, i don't know. But not only that there is no new score in it (like it was in the pirates of the Caribbean - each film new themes), they didn't even really use the old score. <br/><br/>The first 2 hours i was waiting for the ""big scenes"". You know, great action, great score - just like in the first movie. But then i had a dejavu and i realized - it wont get any better. So i want to share this moment with you. I didn't believe it.<br/><br/>You've all seen the first movie? OK. remember during the first hour, when the deltas are in the desert, attacked by a scorpion transformer, and then they send the air attack. You see the pilots running to their planes (great shot by the way) and Steve Jablonsky with his brilliant score. Just enter Scorpnok at youtube and you will find the scene within 20 sec. Anyway, you will see a scene with the same structure, the same desert, the same score, and the same shot of the pilots running to their planes in ROF. Except, the scene in ROF is not so long as the original. <br/><br/>At that point i realized, they don't have nothing new to offer. <br/><br/>I wasn't bored, i liked it, but i was just expecting a way better movie than that one."

My first wish was fulfilled, there's a lot of action and I love that (the best sequence was the one where Optimus Prime fights Megatron, Starscream and Grindor...superb). For some reason I felt Megan was portrayed much better in the first film. The reason I cut 24% is because they showed these Robots as sex machines (that was insulting...Wheelie & Devastator disgusted me).<br/><br/>Director's Work:[10%] This guy is a little crazy. Someone should tell him to stop filling the films with his crappy humor. I really don't know what his job requirements are since the cool-CGI stuff is not his responsibility, he's pretty much useless or maybe there is something for him...lets see: shout ACTION, CUT and PACK-UP.<br/><br/>Acting:[20%] Come on people we are talking about Transformers (particularly not famous for its acting). IMO the best actor was Optimus Prime.<br/><br/>Entertainment Value:[74%] Its 74% entertaining and most of that 74% is because of the cool CGI-effects. As all of you know, seeing Davastator and the Autobots (excluding the Twins), Decepticons in action was cool.<br/><br/>Script:[12%] The only thing that comes close to the bad direction is the Script. The Twins were Stupid and irritating to say the least (I don't know why they were given so much attention and screen time...they never looked heroic to me). Quite a few scenes were really unwanted. I hope they seriously prepare a good script for the next one (if there is one...looking at the box office numbers, there will be a Transformers 3).<br/><br/>__________________________________________________________________ <br/><br/>All the people who LOVED the first film should LIKE this. Anyone who's looking for a time-pass film can watch this. I saw this movie on the first day, first show for Rs.50 (around US$ 1 ...matinee show) and I don't feel cheated. My advice is watch this one at a theater with cheap ticket-price (if possible) and you won't regret it. Some cool CGI stuff waiting for you. <br/><br/>_____ <br/><br/>5.3/10"
"nirmalsuki","6","0","3","9 July 2009"," Personal opinions may differ
","I watched this movie accidentally the other day. (don't ask)<br/><br/>I think they have done what all respectable movie makers will do and make the movie as long as they want it to be, unlike some movies, which end abruptly because they try to cut down on time and cost (Alien Vs. Predator:Requiem was an example of a movie which should have gone on for at least one hour more). All our favourite characters were there from the first movie, plus a few new ones, and we got more action, bigger robots and more (or less) subtle double entendres... (Giant Robot with balls, for example). The one thing lacking, though, was intensity... All points for trying, Michael Bay, but looks like you've tried too hard this time. Too much intensity usually leads to corniness, which this movie had a bit too much of for my liking.<br/><br/>As for the performances: Shia LaBeouf (Samuel James Witwicky) reprised his role as geeky, awkward every-neighbourhood-in-America-has-one type of guy, but this time, he was wiser to the ways of the world, due to the events of the previous movie.<br/><br/>Megan Fox.... Need I say more?<br/><br/>Kevin Dunn and Julie White were Sam's Wacky parents, obviously going through an awkward phase in their marriage, but are not admitting it. (this follows on from the first movie as well).<br/><br/>John Turturro was the real scene stealer of the movie, for me, as he took his role as high-strung sector 7 operative Agent Simmons and turned it as comedic as he possibly could. Outside of an Adam Sandler Movie, this is his best role, and he seems to get better with every movie he makes.<br/><br/>Ramon Rodriguez turned out to be the obnoxious blabbering character (Leo) who worked well with Turturro to make some memorable scenes together.<br/><br/>As for the robots, I thought their parts were robotic, to say the least, and I guess they would take that as a compliment.<br/><br/>Overall movie ratings: Acting: 6/10 Plot: 6/10 Direction: 7/10 Comedy: 6/10 Action: 8/10 Intensity: 4/10 Memorability : 4/10<br/><br/>Overall : 41/70 = 59%"
"depicco","6","0","3","9 July 2009"," A little of everything, but everything mediocre
","Let's say we make aside the plot holes, not nitpicking but the general ones because is not movie art, just a Sunday movie to pass the time. So it does not matter that (SPOILER ALERT) even though Otimus being a prime was killed by a non prime, but could be only revived with the key, unlike Megatron. Let's say that 'the Fallen' (the character) was not a card below the sleeve to have something to talk about, and a lame excuse to write a script (probably because in the series were not enough bad ass villains to choose from). So I go to the movie to watch the special effects, like the woman changing into a robot, or the spheres that turn into a paper thin robot; both lame, as well as the excessive and unnecessary camera movement of the first fight. Big complain: there was an evident lack of effort in the plot."
"evilrodentsofdoom210","5","0","6","8 July 2009"," Pretty Good, But Not Quite Worth The Headache
","I just saw the movie today. I'd remembered how much I had enjoyed the first movie and was expecting this one to be as good as if not better then the first. It was a good movie, lots of actions and it did keep me interested through the whole film. However, there were a lot of plot holes, useless characters, bad acting (Megan Fox) and bits that were very slow bits and also many ideas were left unfinished or abandoned completely. Don't take this film to seriously, the first one was WAY better. I just wished they had stuck with one or two themes through the whole film and developed the characters better. There was a great deal of pointless romantic bits with Sam and Mikeala that were really cold and had no chemistry to them. Most interactions with women in the film bordered on soft core porn. Or with Sam's mom, her getting high within a short time in the film and acting like a psycho. All of the females in the film were really boring, dumb, fake and pointless. You couldn't feel spark with Sam and his girlfriend, it just all felt like a beginning plot to a bad pornography. For some reason to, all the women look similar and all have tans. Megan Fox was about as useful as a rock, not useful to the story one bit. She starts off the movie right away looking like she's going to hump the motorcycle she's sitting on in a mini skirt. Instead of having so many stupid soft core porn bits and useless bickering between the twin gangster robots and that dumb kid from Sam's college that ends up with them, they should have focused more on the dialog and relationship between the characters. I don't mind if they put funny bits in to lighten the mood or sexual chemistry between a Sam and his girl (given that it makes sense). But seriously, put some depth into the characters and come up with some better jokes that don't just fizzle off at the end. However, the robot with the giant wrecking balls for testicles was funny and so was the little humping robot. It was amusing, perverted humor is fun sometimes but not all the time. I kept wondering where the little robot kept disappearing off to, the same with many of the characters, one second they are there, the next they just off and disappear. The visual effects, while amazing, made me dizzy, I'm still getting over a migraine from the quick turns and angles of the camera. I'd have liked if they had made more roles for Bee to speak with his radio, that's far more amusing then fart jokes. If you've seen the first film, go ahead and watch this, it's interesting, but don't expect great things from it. It's a good movie for when your lazy and don't really care about a deep plot, take some Excedrin ahead of time though, you'll need it.<br/><br/>~Anti~"
"lucrodrigues77","5","0","4","7 July 2009"," Disappointing!
","Since when I was a kid and watched cartoons on Sunday mornings, I hoped that one day a live-action Transformers movie would be made. I waited 20 years for that! Now, the first movie was ""acceptable"", it was not perfect, but I thought ""it is their first attempt, the filmmakers will see what didn't work and do it better in the second one"".<br/><br/>So, when I watched ROTF, all my hopes were lost. What the hell was that! Devastator has BALLS!! And Wheelie humping Megan Fox's leg? Why the hell would a robot have the hots for a human? I would understand if he was trying to hump a toaster!! And not to mention John Turturro's butt! At least there was that scene with a nice view of Fox's thighs!<br/><br/>Gosh, if it was not a Transformers movie I would say it's all trash, I only had a bit of interest on it because I'm a huuuuge fan of Transformers and I'll always enjoy seeing the big robots clashing at each other. But if you can mix that with a good coherent story and good acting, it will be much more interesting!"
"azarath1991","4","0","4","7 July 2009"," Couldn't Take it Seriously
","I went into this movie with high expectations. I liked the first film a lot, being a childhood fan of the G1 series. But there were several ""wince"" moments that I just couldn't get around, namely the extremely badly placed awkward humor. After seeing the trailer for ""Fallen"", I had genuine hopes that Bay had learned from his mistakes in the first, and would give us what TF needed to be in the first place; a hardcore giant robot movie that could give us a firm plot and quippy, smart humor throughout. <br/><br/>What I got was a major disappointment.<br/><br/>Instead of fixing the flaws that were in the first film and running with what worked, Michael Bay did the exact opposite: less Original-TF like action and development, and a Bonecrusher-load of awkward humor. Throughout the entire movie, I was seriously waiting for the film to get serious (like the first film did toward the end). Just as the plot was about to take off, they just had to throw in a few more gags. Seriously, Michael. ""Ghetto Twin"" Autobots? Simmons in a dheli? A leg-humping Wheelie? ""Wrecking ball scrotum""? Altogether, it seems to me that they had a pretty good storyline, but decided to throw it in a blender with a whole bunch of slapstick crap.<br/><br/>I really tried to like this movie, and I probably would've if it didn't make me wince so much."
"Barricade84","4","0","4","7 July 2009"," Terrible script, editing and plot, incredible action
","I knew what to expect when I went to Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen, amazing special effects and action, poor screenplay. <br/><br/>What I didn't expect was the level of stupidity of this movie. The editing is terrible, so many scenes out of context you just grab your head and say ""WTF is going on?!??!"" .<br/><br/>the jokes are terrible, those twins, my god they are so annoying!! they just wouldn't shut up..just talk more and more and more.I don't know what the writers thought about when coming up with those 2 characters. The stereotypes of those to robots, so help me god, and that robot doctor with the German accent, what were they thinking??<br/><br/>Sam's mom. I just don't know where to start...the writers got the impression that on the first movie she like ""stole the show"", so they said to themselves ""Hey, why not give her more stupid and unnecessary scenes?!"" She just talks so much! every scene the writers just had to give her as many lines as possible, with many jokes as possible. The Brownie scene for example...what is that has to do with anything?!<br/><br/>I can't remember a movie with so many plot holes..it's unbelievable. A border passage between Egypt and Jordan?! WHERE IS ISRAEL?!?! Sam landing in the desert, holding his broken hand..next shot it's all nicely under cast and bandages...Sam briefly dies and goes to Robot Heaven. Robot Heaven?!?! Why do we have to see John Turturro's thong??? I can go on and on and on...<br/><br/>The length...this movie easily could be narrowed down to 120 mins exactly...but since director Bay likes slow motions and unnecessary scenes...there's not much to do.<br/><br/>The amount of robots is ridiculous..I wish they give SideSwipe more scenes cause he's transformation in the opening scene is AWESOME!!!!! there's enough stuff here for a third movie...<br/><br/>THANK GOD for the special effects...there are some truly amazing moments in this movie, although due to poor camera work and editing sometimes it's hard to figure out who's fighting who, scenes like The Forest Battle is a standout in the movie...a truly jaw dropping scene, Optimus Prime with two swords is one of the coolest things i ever saw and by far the best scene in the movie. Sam's psychotic attack in the classroom was brilliant and intense, but another thing that bugged is that no one seemed to care that he is acting like that and the class just went on as usual. That dog robot ""Ravage"" arrival, to see him running and jumping is spectacular, with those tiny balls piling up creating that thin robot, amazing. Again, this movie has great moments.<br/><br/>I recommend watching this movie only for the SPECIAL EFFECTS. the CGI is a wonder to be hold..and so does Megan Fox. So hot it's a crime.<br/><br/>As for the 3rd movie, I'm wondering how could they surpass this movie in terms of bigness. Cause this movie is unbelievably HUGE.<br/><br/>They have to take a break with this franchise. aim for like a 2012-2013 summer release and do something about the editing the script, and the director, cause Bay is a child. <br/><br/>And try to make it more serious for god sake."
"sirsaid","6","0","3","7 July 2009"," We are here. We are waiting...
","Like Optimus, I'm sending out a message, in the vein hope that Micheal Bay or at least someone who carries some weight in the production of the Transformers movies might hear my thoughts before the next inevitable instalment.<br/><br/>First & foremost I think the producers of this film are having a serious problem recognising & catering to their target demographic. I understand the need to capture the imaginations of a whole new generation of youngsters, but if you're going to do that then maybe try not to base your campaign purely on the premise of Dogs/Robots humping legs.<br/><br/>Jokes about the Jock Frat Boy and his tight T-shirt & ""One man betrayed by his country!"" made me & a cinema full of young adults chuckle sufficiently enough. Most of the other jokes seemed to hit a little too far south of the 12A certificate & insult the intelligence of any one old enough to get in.<br/><br/>Consistency wise it just seems rather heavy handed to punctuate scenes (which are clearly aimed at the younger audiences) with inappropriate language as if it were some kind of nod to the older viewers, just to keep them feeling included.<br/><br/>Instead I feel their should be a focus on plot development & more screen time for some of those amazing looking robots in battle. I really would have liked to have seen more from new additions Sideswipe & Jolt, who's abilities & character's aren't really explored in any great depth.<br/><br/>Overall I don't think the film was a roaring success but neither was it a complete failure, I was entertained & impressed by aspects of it & definitely recommend a second viewing to help make sense of some of those chaotic battles. Revenge of The Fallen has maintained my interest in the franchise for now, but I am really hoping that the production team raise their game for part three."
"beau-86","4","0","4","7 July 2009"," CGI (Candy Graphically Induced) But Not For Kids
","Built on the faith from enjoying the first one, you just hold on and watch in awe of the visuals. Every now and then you actually feel overloaded yet elated from all this, but then you start to get numb from it after the 2nd hour with no contrast, asking yourself is this all there is? No one expects an academy award in a film like this, but with Spielberg's ongoing push to move Hollywood to Bollywood to retain old studio system profit goals. We can predict an Oscar in Special Effects this year with this Bollywood calling card.<br/><br/>For film fans who like more than CGI you might be let down. For those of us who bought a ticket, expect even more of these films as we financially reward studios for delivering these products.<br/><br/>But with the overpriced tickets today, you do get 2.5 hrs of movie for your money, and some of the most intense CGI scenes ever. But not much else is really behind the virtual curtain. Even with the extremely hot females cast in the film, the rest of this film is a limp and lifeless mass, with no real hook to it.<br/><br/>For the younger ones who liked the first Transformers, obviously money talks because PG-13 for liberals is a bit under-rated for this R film. However most desensitized teens will be fine; but some parents may not appreciate the drugs, sexual scenes, language, crude humor, alternate lifestyles, graphic violence, intense action and battle sequences. Take the last Transformers and multiply it 10 times for your elementary school kids.<br/><br/>The battle scenes in Egypt were truly a thrill ride. In a theater environment, this might be worth the money alone. Since no home theater system for most of us can shake from the action like this movie does.<br/><br/>But like a traffic accident on the side of the road: you still turn your head to watch, even though you know you'll probably be disappointed again. You will still talk about the graphics at work the next day, but not much else really registers even on the drive home."
"ramdaman8","4","0","4","5 July 2009"," Highly disappointed.
","Honestly this movie was just a huge disappointment. I know it's just a mindless summer blockbuster, but Mikey Bay didn't have to take the mindless part to heart. There's just a ridiculous amount of plot holes and inconsistencies.It just seemed like the writers wrote the script in one go, and didn't bother to read over it. It's really surprising considering two of them were the Star Trek writers which was a great film. Revenge of the Fallen could not even meet the mediocrity of the first film. It's almost like Bay just decided we're gonna have more of everything in this film. They tried way too hard to be funny whereas the first picked its moments rather well, and was pretty entertaining as a result. There is certainly more action, but it seemed more incomprehensible than the first one. I didn't have a problem following the action in the first Transformers, but there were literally two separate instances in which i thought Megatron was killed when he wasn't. If i had to sum up this movie in a condensed manner I'd call it a really crappy anime shot in live-action. It's all about robots and up-skirts with this one."
"mhibanez07","7","0","2","5 July 2009"," well, what did you expect. i thought it was fun
","take it for what its worth. 1. its a bay movie. so lots of explosions, lots of fighting, lots of sunset helicopter scenes, lots of half naked girls,and really cliché jokes<br/><br/>2.its all about giant living robotic aliens that can morph into whatever man-made machine they want. and by chance they decided to have a death match on our planet<br/><br/>so my conclusion before i even entered the theater was ""how much of a plot could this possibly have?"" and just as i suspected there was none. BUT, that does not mean i didn't enjoy it. it had exactly what i expected. i saw it in imax and it delivered outstanding special effects and visual quality, extremely loud and CLEAR not distorted audio that made you feel every autobots footstep in depths of your chest. over all i thought it was a good movie. very entertaining, and isn't that what a movie is all about?"
"lilareeb","6","0","3","5 July 2009"," Good in a stupid way but could be much much better
","This is a pretty good movie however it could have been 10x better. Its more of a stupid/nonsense comedy with random romance and dumb cheesy moments. When I was a kid I loved watching transformers. When the 1st transformers movie came out I waited an hour in line to see it. When I saw this movie I was like was this movie made by little kids, I mean testicles the size of two semi trucks and ""man parts"" that are half a football field long. Don't wanna forget all robo-humping. Seriously...I ain't gonna lie but I did get a few laughs outta that stuff.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of transformers you should watch it, you will like it, if you never were a fan or you though the previous transformers was alright, well you may not like it. Me, I liked it, also my dad who hates unreal stuff. Watch it, knock your self out."
"mr_guy966","7","0","2","5 July 2009"," What is everyone's problem?
","I have been reading many people's comments on T:RotF. I finally had the chance to see it yesterday and I have to ask, what is everyone's problem? Everyone is blasting this movie left to right with comments on how it's too long, there's too much action, there's no story what-so-ever, there's gratuitous sexuality, there's blatant racism and stereotypes and so and so forth. This leads me to my next question: what's so different in this movie than what's in other action or sci-fi movies? This movie has a simple storyline with no twists or turns, it's got great action sequences, impressive visual effects, decent acting, and some good chuckles here and there. I agree that there were scenes that were crude or unnecessary, and content mature enough to warrant a 14-A rating rather than PG-13, but find a movie for me that doesn't have at least one instance of racism or crudeness, no matter how ""light-hearted"" it may be, and whether it be a movie for everyone or one for older audiences. Again, as for the action, there was no more or less action in this movie than there was in the first. The acting, storyline and humour was about equal and the visual effects were just as impressive. The problem is that people were expecting 1st prize when really all we were getting was an honourable mention. That honourable mention was exactly what I was expecting and I got exactly what I paid for. <br/><br/>I don't want to ramble on so I'll just say that if you're a fan of Transformers, watch this movie. If you love action, watch this movie. If you're bored and looking for something to do, watch this movie. It may not ""wow"" you, but it won't disappoint. It's just another summer blockbuster. Enjoy it. I did."
"czyczaro","6","0","3","5 July 2009"," Hurt my feelings?
","I will say yes to that question...the humping, the testicles, the sexual humor or robots acting like idiots doesn't work for me at all in this kind of movie, I think that the writers and specially M. Bay are more interest in this things than to make a really cool movie trying to exceed all the expectations generated from Transformers 1. On the other hand, think this time the action was better and impressive, but it doesn't save the movie.<br/><br/>I have to say i'm a big fan of special effects, personally have a 52"" HDTV and a blu-ray player and think that this movie will look great when I buy it (yes I just have explain that i'm a big fan of special effects), but... I will like to make some questions to Michael Bay and his crew, just to be answer by themselves and say some words too: <br/><br/>1. Don't you saw Transformers show when you all were youngsters? So much people love this characters, why you have the need to destroy them and not to glorify them? <br/><br/>2. There are so many great movies from the past and present who never use stupid and bad jokes, sexual humor and stereotypes, why you need this, you think that is fun to see a robot's testicles? Give me a break.<br/><br/>3. It's a movie about robots, I wanna see them all the time, not the US Army or so many ads. Bay, I now that you need some elements from the army but you don't have to sell yourself to the militia just to show his equipment.<br/><br/>4. There are movies like The dark Knight or Watchmen where his creators bet for quality, why don't you bet for this too? <br/><br/>5. Let's hope you'll make a better job for the next time.<br/><br/>FINAL WORDS Bay, Spielberg, Orci, Kruger, Kurtzman... you have a great opportunity to make a great movie that could be remember for his greatness, but you have to slaughter the autobots and decepticons with this bad treatment...what a shame, please don't make movies just for money... and Steven, what is wrong with you?<br/><br/>I used to hate posts and commentaries in IMDb.com, but this can serve to open the eyes of movie makers to give us better films... keep commenting!"
"jezzyt_14","6","0","4","5 July 2009"," Expect less = Enjoy more
","I saw this film about two weeks after its release, so I had plenty of reviews to influence my decision on whether or not I will enjoy this film. At first I was expecting it to be on par or better than the first Transformers film as the first teaser trailer for the film (which is amazing by the way) made the film seem truly epic. After watching it, the only thing *epic* about the film is the runtime. Not to say it's a bad thing, but it is most definitely long. With many reviews that claimed that the film is nowhere near as good as the first film (e.g. Roger Ebert gave the film 'one' star out of five), I truly believed that if I was gonna to like this film, I was going to have to expect much less. <br/><br/>In my opinion, it is true what most people say in that this film doesn't really have much of a plot, but when you think about it, the first Transformers didn't really have much of a plot either. Both films are essentially Autobots vs. Decepticons with humans stuck in the middle. The difference being that the first film introduces us to a cool and stunning visualisation of the always famous Transformers. The second film basically playing the same gimmick once again, only longer and with loads more slow-motion sequences. <br/><br/>I must say, I definitely thought this movie was slightly better than people made it out to be. But I can see why most people would absolutely hate it. Really only one thing bothered me. The DIALOGUE. Not so much the content, just the way it was presented by the actors. Optimus and Megatron were my favourite characters because they spoke slow enough for me to understand what they were saying. If there was indeed a real plot for this film, it was wasted on me because of that Superman-paced dialogue presented from the characters of Sam, Leo and Agent Simmons (even Mudflap and Skids on some occasions).<br/><br/>In conclusion, most people will know exactly what this film delivers from the trailers, and if you're expecting Godfather like storytelling with De Niro grade acting, then you're most definitely wasting your time. Basically there are three things you should expect from this film. 1. Transformers beating each other up, 2. Cool visual effects and amazing sound, 3. Megan Fox. If you go in, expecting to see those three things, then you'll enjoy the film a whole load more."

Sam must then embark on a daring adventure and discover the secret of the Transformers origins if he hopes to combat the evil Decepticons. As expected—and much like its predecessor—doesn't provide much in terms of story and mostly coasts by on explosive action, superior special effects...and noise.

","Not a bad movie, but more the same. I like Transformers two, but if you have seen the first movie you have basically seen the second one too. The script, acting and directing is good. I will not call Transpormers two a bad film. There is a but however here. The special effects were great in this film, but however are the same effects as in the first film. The special effects were mind blowing effect for the first film, but are the same old same old for the second film. Their is some comedy and a lot of eye candy in this film to provide balance for the special effects. I give the film a six out of ten. A decent summer film; it will be a soon to see on VOD."

","Yes, I admit. I was so hooked up to see Transformers 2 and I almost anger myself for not going to its first-day premiere in my country. Several reviews by my friends said it was BETTER than the first so I was more pumped.<br/><br/>But then, another movie disappoint me.<br/><br/>I didn't say I dislike it. It was really good. The effects are top-notch and the actors did their job well. Except for Alice though, I don't like her character at all. What I had expected when I saw Transformers 2 was an action packed movie filled with light humor to keep us awake, and also, like any other movie, a reasonable and interesting plot.<br/><br/>I admit, I got to see an action packed movie. But the humor? Meh. It was alright. Not too bad but not that funny either. The movie just didn't... make my brain think. And there are lots of plot holes too. I mean, where are the twin robots? Are they eaten? Dead? Or what? Definitely a bad filler. They didn't do anything significant.<br/><br/>The plot didn't seem so interesting so me. I'm sorry but I was expecting more than that. The Leo thing was also disturbing, but heck, it gave off the comedy.<br/><br/>It was worth it, but I'm not going to watch it for the second time."
"kchiola","6","0","4","3 July 2009"," Entertaining but tacky...
","I did my best not to get excited about Transformers 2. I patiently awaited the premier and when I finally did see it, I was glad I didn't get all worked up.<br/><br/>Yes, Optimus in the forest saying ""I'll take you all on!"" got my adrenalin going. Yes, I got a little choked up when Sam was telling his parents to leave but his father was didn't want to go. But in the end, the really great parts of the movie were overshadowed by the cheesy, tacky parts.<br/><br/>What really distracted me was the unnecessary use of foul language, stereotypes, and sexual innuendos. I myself didn't care, but this is a movie for all ages. I could handle the mother and her swearing for the most part because it's funny in moderation, but when the twins referred to the roommate as a p*%@y, I had to draw the line. That was nothing but dialogue going for a cheap laugh. Other things that irritated me were robots humping human legs, giant testicles, and a navy ship commander firing a rail gun at the Egyptian pyramids with authorization from a nobody as far as he was concerned. Let's not forget the southern/black personality based twins who just happen to ""don't do so much reading.""<br/><br/>And I also understand that character development is not something I am going to get a lot of, but please, just a little. In the first Transformers, you got to know the robots and there personalities. You get virtually none of that (minus the twins who were annoying anyway).<br/><br/>6 out of 10 because it had some funny and cool parts and I would see it again."
"jakobbulow","7","0","2","3 July 2009"," Special effects, and a thin plot, oh and, special effects.
","This movie is a typical Michael Bay movie. It has everything to it, that a summer flick needs. A somewhat poor plot, a hot (the worlds hottest) girl, and someone is chosen to save the universe. The acting in the movie isn't the best but it is not at all bad either. If you come with the same expectation as me, it is just what you expect. An action-packed movie filled with special effects, slowmotion, and may i say, awesome fight-scenes. It has everything you want to see in a hot summernight. You can sum it up: 80% action-packed fight and demolition scenes. 20% storyline. - Or at least what i thought about it after. In my opinion, it is a movie everyone who likes the action-genre will love. It's definitely time well spent. But if you do not like the action-genre, i have two words for you, to encourage you to watch this movie: ""Megan Fox""."

","the movie was a waste of time the only reason i check it out is because someone ask to go see it with them. don't get me wrong the first was alright. but i have learn when dealing with Michael Retard Bay its best to wait till the dust settles. the opening scene was a waste of time and money to make a special effects that didn't really help set the plot. there were scene that i felt was lost and didn't have any meaning to the movie like when auto-bots called his mom and started saying something weird to here then she responds by saying something cheesy. the acting in this movie was below mediocre because the writers and directors did a half ass job. GMC could have just skipped and big screen and sponsored the whole movie and went straight to the silver screen cause the whole thing felt like a GMC commercial. and the ending where do i start with the end scenes i felt like Michael Bay just hand the directors chair to the U.S Army cause it felt like a recruitment tool."

","Transformers 2 is no better than the first one. Overall it is boring and the plot is bad. Some parts of this movie were interesting but certainly not many. The fights between the transformers were boring and not interesting at all. The only good part of this movie was Megan Fox.<br/><br/>This movie could have been made a hell of a lot better than how it was. And the plot is quite hard to understand as well - which certainly didn't help my impression of the movie. There was simply nothing special about this movie. It was just some stupid childish robots walking around which can transform - toddler material.<br/><br/>I certainly don't recommend anyone to watch this movie. There are many, many better ways to spend your money, than on this film.<br/><br/>I would give this a 3/10 rating."

","Those of you who have seen the cartoons but haven't seen the first movie might be surprised that the Transformers do not resemble the sleek, cool designs from the cartoons. Instead, the larger Transformers resemble rock monsters and the smaller ones resemble muppets. I found it hard to tell the difference between classic characters like Starscream and Megatron, as they both looked and acted like big, dumb, lumbering rock monsters.<br/><br/>The script of this movie seems to be the product of some decent writing and also a great deal of junky writing. The director Michael Bay seems to favor the junky writing, often rushing through a decent part of the script to make more time for a lame action scene and more over-acting.<br/><br/>What's really sad about this movie is it takes itself seriously. Shia's character appears to be honestly frightened as a Muppet-like transformer probes his mouth and nose. Later in the movie several rock monster-like Transformers make threats to human soldiers, and it's just totally unbelievable.<br/><br/>There are a couple of glimmers of hope in this movie. There is one scene where Optimus Prime meets Shia's character (Sam) in a graveyard and asks for his help. Sam honorably refuses to help, saying that he deserves to have a normal life. There's another scene where Optimus Prime takes on several Decepticons while wielding sword-like weapons. These are some very short scenes, not lasting longer than several minutes.<br/><br/>There's one funny scene in this movie that almost makes it worth the price of admission. It's a scene where Shia's character is attacked by a girl Transformer. Shia's character screams like a bitch as he runs away from her.<br/><br/>This movie also contains several scenes of dog-humping, and several racist Transformer designs."

","This is definitely not what I expected. The first Transformers movie was a so good adaptation that I was completely delighted with it... but this one... this is something else. Like first, there is suddenly a bunch of funny robots that are doing too much human things, and too much stupid things so they easily insult you intelligence, the least what I expected to see is an old robot which we see as ""old"" because he needs a walking stick and he has a metal beard?! And suddenly a character in the movie dies but later they find a way to revive it, and then another character dies so they find a way to revive him too, and some of the characters that died in the first Transformers movie get revived also... and then, big finale, another character sacrifices himself to give power to another... too much dying and reviving for me. Sometimes I had an impression I'm watching a drama. (I do not want to say what characters because I don't want this to be a spoiler)<br/><br/>Well, the positive sides... the visual effects are very impressive indeed. Actually, they are right as I expected, but they are somehow buried under all this boring drama atmosphere. What I also noticed, in one scene that lasts for a few seconds, the rendered robots (autobots) do not fit the camera-recorded background perfectly... but let's say we can forget that. The humor is pretty good too, but just as I said, because of that humor, the sci-fi part paid it's price.<br/><br/>The best, and most original characters in the movie according to me: Agent Simmons, Optimus Prime, and the little remote-controlled-car decepticon."
"ct342808","6","0","4","29 June 2009"," Terrible plot, Decent laughs
","the very first scene which included Megan Fox was ridiculous and absurd. I go to a movie to see some sort of reality mixed in with imagination and no person will ever prop themselves up on a motorcycle to paint a logo on it like she did. Look for great actors and actresses, NOT the super model robot with the incredibly inappropriate extensive tongue. At one point in every scene I was simply waiting for a sexual scene or pun on words. Even when they traveled to Egypt they HAD to put a sexual scene where they landed Scrotum in face. Other than the lack of seriousness and turning a child toy into a teenage dildo it was an exciting film, but in no way was in up to par to the first film. When I was told the movie was going to be nearly 2 and a half hours long I was excited to see it, but once I got there and realized an hour of that time was carried on and on with sexual quotes that had no need to b a part of the movie, this also includes some of the fight scenes as well that did nothing for me, and most definitely nothing for the plot to drive it forward."
"freaky_dave","6","0","4","28 June 2009"," Not as horrible as some say, but not as good as the first either
","I listened to all the critics and some of the people who trashed this film. I still went to see it anyway, and was stunned why it was getting such negativity. I mean some people are making this out to be the worst movie ever, and it's definitely not that horrible. I'll admit it could've been better, which is why I can't quite recommend it, but I'm telling you this is not a piece of trash by a long shot.<br/><br/>SOme people are complaining about the twins and how racist they were, but I don't here many people talking about how sexist the movie was against women, and what about the nerdy white FBI guy who was made out to look like a complete idiot, and weak. SO the racism and sexism go more then just one way. In fact if I had to complain about either one of these, I would say it was worse against women then anything. All the women are made out to look like nothing more than sex symbols. Let's see, we had a robot humping the leg of Megan Fox, and the other women in this film do little or nothing but look gorgeous.<br/><br/>On top of all this, the parents of Sam weren't used properly in this movie like in the first. In the first movie they helped to make the movie more fun, but this time they offer no humor other than the mother getting high on drugs and going around making a fool of herself on a college campus showing everybody Sam's baby booty's. THis was in bad taste in my opinion and not funny at all.<br/><br/>Other points that bothered me about this movie were that there were scenes that went on forever and never seemed to want to end. THe final half hour or so was probably the most tedious I ever sat through, but the action scenes before that and the special effects throughout made it a little more bearable. I also like that they made Optimus Prime more of a bad ass. In the first film he was getting whipped by Megatron, but they changed that around with this movie. In fact, Optimus gets some of the better lines in the movie.<br/><br/>I've given some factors why this movie was bad, but I also have to applaud the action sequences, as stated above, and the special effects which were great. Transformers is not the type of movie where you go in looking for a good story. Given these facts, to go with the lack of humor from the cast, I give it an average grade of 6 out of 10. Not the trash that people are calling it, but not quite up there where it needs to be a good movie. THats all."
"moviewizguy","6","0","4","28 June 2009"," Revenge is coming.
","Decepticon forces return to Earth on a mission to take Sam Witwicky prisoner, after the young hero learns the truth about the ancient origins of the Transformers. Joining the mission to protect humankind is Optimus Prime, who forms an alliance with international armies for a second epic battle.<br/><br/>So there it was. The trailer. Played on the silver screen. It looked darker than the previous film. The tagline ""Revenge is coming"" reinforces that aspect. It excited me. This could really be a serious, dark movie, like THE DARK KNIGHT. I was wrong. So wrong. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. I was insane hoping for a serious, dark, gritty action flick from Michael Bay. In fact, the trailer doesn't show any of the crude and sexual humor throughout the film. And you know what? I found the jokes pretty funny. Sure, some of the jokes are just disgusting (you'd be surprised what lays hidden in this movie), but I liked the laid back feel.<br/><br/>The plot was...confusing, I will admit, but in a film like this, does it really matter? The movie never ceases to be entertaining. The action sequences are amazing, but directed by Michael Bay, it's not surprising. If there is one thing I have to say about him, he knows how to entertain audiences. And he was right when he said there would be more action scenes in the film. You thought the first movie had a lot of action scenes? Oh, God, I wouldn't even begin. To keep it simple, the special effects are nothing short of being flawless. I loved the score by Steve Jablonsky, most of it being brought back from the first movie.<br/><br/>In an interview with Megan Fox, the sexy actress said the following: ""This movie is not about acting."" And she's right. I can go on saying that the humans in the films were actually the robots, but that's not particularly true. You have to give credit to Shia LaBeouf's part, at least. He does a swell job, given the material. I found John Turturro to be quite annoying in the first film but the producers or writers decided it was a good idea to bring him back. I still found him annoying in the film and I especially rolled my eyes when he was doing a serious scene.<br/><br/>This goes along with Sam's parents in the film, Kevin Dunn and Julie White, although I don't find them quite as annoying. In fact, I enjoyed most of their scenes. They give some good comic relief throughout the film. I just didn't like them being serious because you just can't take them seriously. The writers apparently thought Ramon Rodriguez's character was a good idea. I just really hated him. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson also returned for the sequel, although they don't have much to do. Overall, the whole cast pretty much had one thing to do: Run in slow motion.<br/><br/>With all the positives, there was no doubt some negatives. The most obvious is the overly long running time. I don't think Michael Bay ever made a movie less than two hours. I would've liked the movie if it were thirty minutes shorter. It was until the third act that I realized how long the movie was going to be. It started to meander a bit after that and there came a point in the film that there was just overkill. The movie was just really long. Another thing that annoyed me was a pair of twin Transformers. Actually, add another Transformer. All three of them were yelling profanity throughout. Not my thing.<br/><br/>If you walk into the movie with the right mindset, you'd be surprised that you had enjoyed most of the film. The action sequences are just fantastic but the plot is lacking. The actors don't have much to do but to run around and scream. But really, what are you going to expect when you walk into a Michael Bay film? A plot? Great performances? A delightful script? Nah. You'd expect action. Action. And did I mention action?"
"eched","7","0","4","28 June 2009"," I'm going to go over the cons first BUT
","But that doesn't mean I hate the film, though the cons do come more easily to mind then the pros. I think it's do to there being more cons then pros, but the pros are very high, so I guess you could say it balances itself out. Well, anyways, let's get started: <br/><br/>Cons: This is Transformers part 3 not part 2: At the start of the film Prime tells us that the government is working with the autobots in a group known as nest. Nest is formed of many different autobots and in the first 10 min we meet them all, but the film never introduces any of them. It pretty much assumes that we already know all these characters, though I don't see how. Then 5 min later it dumps all these extra nest characters and the actual film starts. It feels like the nest autobots would have been the heroes from part 2 and the opening is simply a recap to say what happened to them and then we move onto the third film, only there is no second film. There's this motorcycle autobot, and this autobot with massive blades coming out of his hands, but does the film ever bother to tell you these characters names or anything at all about them, no. They just pop up and then are gone again. Really, the motorcycle bot had ONE line, what was the point of even putting her in there. And the sad thing is only long time fans of the series are even going to know who this autobot was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Random powers: Out of the blue, or at least it feels that way to me, transformers can suddenly teleport and move objects with their mind. There is no reason for these powers or no explanation for them, they are simply there.<br/><br/>Barricade is still missing: We all remember how Barricade simply disappeared in the first one with really no reason why. I was really wanting, and kind of expecting, for him to show back up, but he's still just gone.<br/><br/>Random plot points: Transformer ghosts! <br/><br/>Decepticon girl bot: Once again, another bot that goes the way of Barricade. She simply disappears for no reason. I really don't believe the car wreck would have killed her, she's a blasted transformer! I don't know why this series simply keeps on forgetting about its characters.<br/><br/>And now the pros: The Action: Much better done in this one.<br/><br/>The special effects: Kind of a no brainier, but it can not be said enough that the visuals in this series are simply ground braking.<br/><br/>Scorponok! It may have been only 50 seconds of film but when Scorponok busted out of the sand I nearly got up and cheered. That's what I'm talking about, a character that was simply dropped in the last film popping up out of nowhere and kind of saying, I'm back! Why couldn't the same thing be done for Barricade? Scorponok was the best part of the film.<br/><br/>The comedy: MUCH of it does fall flat and MUCH of it is in bad taste, but the first was just as bad with its comedy with Jazz. I still none the less laughed a bit.<br/><br/>So, a high 6. Rounding up I would say seven. My cons make the film seem horrid, but I'm still glad I saw it and it should be a film seen on the big screen."
"ahopper-4","7","0","5","26 June 2009"," An unintentional comedy
","Let's face it, this is not the sort of movie you go to if you want to see Oscar worthy acting, nor if you want an amazing plot.<br/><br/>You go to see this movie if you want to see good (and in many cases, better than good) CGI, eye candy, and stuff being blown up.<br/><br/>On that front: even critics of this movie must agree it delivers spectacularly.<br/><br/>But this movie comes through in an unexpected way: as a comedy. I spent the vast majority of the movie laughing. Skids and Mudflap provide excellent comic relief to anyone who can relate to twins (ignoring the racial controversy that has been brought up by people looking to be offended), the little lovers quarrels between Shia and Megan will remind anyone of their youth in a rather humorous way, and the mom has some genuinely funny moments."
"waldo9254","6","0","5","26 June 2009"," Entertaining As Advertised
","Regardless of all the other reviews, everyone knows they got their $10 worth out of this movie. You were entertained for 2 1/2 hours of you would have left. If you thought it sucked and stayed anyways then that shows what a genius you are. Reading some of these reviews cracks me up. People expected this movie to be the Holy Grail of movies and change their lives and cure cancer etc. That's what Obama is for remember. Oh wait, hes failing to deliver just like this movie is.<br/><br/>Pros: Shia LeBeouf is an awesome actor. He nails the character. Who should be playing Sam Witwicky? Zach Efron? ha ha. Seriously though, Zach Efron is a tool. I know Spielberg would agree with me. Who can argue with that? Megan Fox delivers on the sex appeal aspect of the film as expected. You don't have to act when you are that sexy. This has been proved time and time again. Sorry to all the soccer moms out there who want to believe their 14 year old boys aren't interested in boobs. They are. Moving on,the story regarding The Fallen was good. There was a nice variety of Transformers in this one. Special effects, explosions, cleavage shots....all good.<br/><br/>Cons: Apparently the Decepticons have the ability to send a Terminator/hot college chick to kill Sam Witwicky/Sarah Connor. Super Lame. Also, the Decepticons are all massive tanks that transform into buildings while the Autobots are lame bankrupt Chevy wannabe smart cars that transform into out houses. Hardly a fair fight. Also the Decepticons can communicate telepathically and out nubmer the Autobots at a 10:1 ratio. To the soccer moms defense, the college scenes were poorly done...especially the party. Though hot robot chicks are easy. That part was true. All in all, this film was too long and tried too hard to get laughs. Sometimes they succeeded but they had a lot of attempts.<br/><br/>Important Note: Micael Bay stated he added the annoying twins for the comedic value. It's not his fault that stereotypes are true though. If black people relate the the robots that speak broken English with gold teeth and can't read then that's their choice. Don't worry, Obamas free health care will give them more teeth while hard working Americans pay for it. This movie will be a great Blu-Ray.

"SebaZava","4","0","5","25 June 2009"," Should've been called ""Explosion: The Movie.""
","Simply put, this second Transformers flick should've been called Explosion: The Movie. There are more scenes of destruction, shooting, bombing, exploding, fighting, jumping, punching and running than in any other Bay movie, war movie, science fiction movie, action flick or any of the actual World Wars. If this film hasn't broken any kind of destruction records, then I don't know what can. And this kind of exaggeration could indeed be thrilling - or even funny - were it not for some of the silliness Bay and his team of writers decide to include. The first Transformers worked because, when compared to the sequel, it was pretty nuanced. (Never thought I would say something like that about a Bay movie.) Revenge of the Fallen has too much of everything, and on top of that, it's definitely too long. Not a completely bad film - although most of the North American critics will definitely state the contrary - but, in my book, an inferior movie to its predecessor.<br/><br/>Michael Bay is the master of all things action, and he certainly shows his skills here, blowing up everything that could possibly explode. I kinda liked the action, I guess - there are tons of explosions - duh -, tons of scenes of the military trying to shoot at the bad robots, using missiles, bombs, tanks, machine guns, guns and aircraft, and a lots of scenes featuring robots trying to beat the crap out of each other. The thing is, there comes a moment when it's all too much, when it all becomes too repetitive and over-the-top. I guess I could say there are too many explosions, too much shooting and too much use of a shaky cam - and yes, that's precisely the way the movie makes you feel: that there's too much, and that it all should have stopped like ten scenes ago. During the first 2/3 or so of the movie the action is relentless in the sense that it doesn't cease to entertain, but during the last 30 or 40 minutes it's relentless in the sense that it just keeps coming. Come on, Bay, you of all people should know when to stop.<br/><br/>Other problem? Just like there's too much action, too many explosions and too many scenes - the film is definitely about half an hour too long -, there are too many robots. Guys like Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and even The Fallen we can recognize. The thing is, there are like twenty other robots in the movie, and Bay doesn't even have the decency to show them without shaking his camera. Moreover, they don't have any personality - they just have names or colors. I liked the bickering between Megatron and Starscream; I somehow liked the little robot which turned into a toy car, and I definitely enjoyed the way the old transformer with a beard and a walking cane was presented, but what about those two that turned into bikes? Or the annoying twins that make Jar Jar Binks seem hilarious? Or that big one that ate all that sand in Egypt and seemed to have a pair of big, metallic balls between his legs? (Yes, that's Bay's idea of sophisticated humour.) I'm sure the movie could have done with ten or so robots less.<br/><br/>It's not like Bay cares about acting, but some of the actors that participate in his movies at least care about their performances. Take Shia LaBeouf, for example, who tries to inject some humanity into his character despite the fact that the screenplay uses him only to run and shout. If Sam is charismatic and worth rooting for - and ultimately works as a compelling leading character - it's because of LaBeouf, not due to the filmmakers' work. I also liked Josh Duhamel, and Kevin Dunn and Julie White as Sam's parents were pretty funny. John Turturro, reprising his role from the previous movie, gave a memorable performance as always, although his character has somehow changed. On the other hand, I didn't get the point of Megan Fox's character. Okay, so she's incredibly hot, but she was also incredibly useless. Pure eye-candy, no substance. (We're talking about Megan Fox here, guys, not the movie... or are we?) Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is all right because, despite all its flaws, it definitely never bored me, and because from a visual and technical standpoint, it's certainly a marvel, something worth taking a look at. The film is a mix of the good, the bad and the ugly, and one of the hardest films I've ever had to review, only because I was terribly entertained by it, but also - very frequently - terrified by it. And not because it's a scary movie, but because it can be a very bad movie. Still, it's got some terrific action sequences - which kind get old during the last half an hour or so of running time - and some very funny parts, so those who liked the first - superior - movie should have a blast with this one. The rest of us puny humans, though, will be left exhausted by the time the end credits start to roll. I wonder why three writers - two of them being responsible for the screenplay of the amazing and decidedly smarter Star Trek - were needed to pen the movie's screenplay. I don't even remember if there was any dialogue... and if there was, was it really needed? Wasn't this a series of action sequences, CGI scenes and shots of Megan Fox running in slow motion with the camera focusing on her breasts?"
"stonemountainproductions","7","0","4","25 June 2009"," Michael Bay. All action... No story.
","I'm not a big fan of Michael Bay at all. He seems to concentrate more on the action of the movie and less about story and character development. That might be good for some of you, but for the rest of us... Transformers 2 was Michael Bay at his best. All action and no story or character development. I must admit, I loved the first film and thought to myself, wow, maybe Mr. Bay is beginning to grow up. Nope. I was wrong. He butchered the Transformers franchise. The autobots that were in the first film really never had any kind of character development in this film. Most of the film they were missing. The movie was too long. A lot of the going to college scenes could have been cut out. They were irrelevant to the story. The fight scenes between the transformers were hard to follow because most of them were the same colors. Prime and Bumblebee were my favorites. A plus to the movie was the effects. They were great and really deserve to be nominated for an Oscar. You can tell they put a lot of effort into them. The beginning of the film was better then the second half. Still, go see the film. It's worth a watch. Just go to the bathroom before you see it. I made that mistake."

I went to see the film out of nostalgia for my childhood(my parents would not take me to the 86 movie because they refused to pay for an hour and a half commercial lol). I went and really, really got surprised. I loved it. Therefore, I had the same expectation of ROTF. I read all the negativity before I went to see it, and discarded it as die hards being too critical. This movie was a big letdown. The plot had potential, but the humor was far too detracting to get anything really serious going. I don't mind shutting my brain off for two and a half hours to watch giant robots beat the heck out of each other, but the dumbed down humor in this film didn't even let me enjoy that. I would have to say that if I went in with my expectations for the first film I would have been mildly entertained, but I was let down. I was counting on this film to be my favorite of the season, and it just really felt like a mild headache. I predicted that they would kill off Prime again, but the film just dragged on without him. Of course they resurrected him in the same film which was like a slap in the face. All said and done I gave it seven stars, if it wasn't Transformers it would have been 5."

When I was I child I used to watch the TV cartoon series where the robots (Autobots) where my heroes... Now, in this movie, as the first one that was filmed, you can see more about Sams life (Sam fighting, driving, kissing his girl) but you can not see the Autobots acting as heroes...

"rich_mac00","7","0","4","24 June 2009"," Could have been so much more
","OK so basically Transformers 2 Revenge of the Fallen takes a lot of what was used in the first film. Decepticons and Autobots both search for something of great importance, Sam Whitwicky helps out and the US Army get to blow A LOT of things up. A lot cheesy moments but nothing too bad, at least I didn't think so. <br/><br/>Great things about this film were again, John Tuturo, the Whitwickys and HOT girls. The scenes involving the transformers were again absolutely spot-on and IMHO a lot better than the first film. The action scenes are incredible, something which Bay has down to a T, while all other scenes and dialogue are merely used to explain the next set of events. The plot itself is solid if a little drawn out, much of the crucial information is squashed into brief dialogues, while many pointless scenes are overly drawn out. The transition of the film is also another issue as it is constructed in such a way that there are 2 distinct acts as it were, each one on its own could be a film although obviously the 2nd part is WAY better. Don't leave the film early or you'll miss the best bits. <br/><br/>The new transformers were all pretty cool but they were woefully underdeveloped. For example the auto bot who turns into the silver Chevrolet concept car is in A LOT of the film but is never named. The new Decepticons, apart from one have no background, which is a massive disappointment to those who are familiar with the Transformers universe. Bay really needed help on this one, or just a better script.<br/><br/>Overall this film is a 7.5/10 mainly due to the fact that it didn't fulfil its potential, some of the scenes were unnecessary and could have been swapped to further character development and that I'm not sure what Bay was getting at with the college scenes and most of Megan Fox's scenes, who bless, is so ridiculously hot but can't act. I always think that the 2nd film in a trilogy is the most important as it is the one where most of the plot gets unravelled, we find where allegiances lie and characters really get developed. Bay has missed a trick from Star wars here and has made a skin deep but beautiful, awesome action film. I will obviously buy the DVD for the commentary to find out what his intentions were throughout the movie."

","Another summer blockbuster...<br/><br/>I'll cut straight to the point. The movie isn't bad, it feels polished and looks okay. One of the huge things about the movie is the plot. It has way more twists than the first one, but nothing really awesome though. In addition to that, there are many things that are unexplained in this movie (and they are necessary). And probably the most ironic thing is that these new mysteries doesn't get you anticipating for the next movie.<br/><br/>Some robot additions felt forced, as if they do it just to fit the head count (especially Arcie, with a total screen time of less than 5 minutes, and had no impact on the story whatsoever). Very few additions felt distinct from one another.<br/><br/>There are also scenes that don't make sense. For instance, there's a scene where the soldiers (trained specifically to fight against the decepticons) had to fight the decepticons. But even knowing that normal 5.56 rifle rounds won't do any harm to them, they still decided to do so. Shouldn't they have learned that only incendiary rounds can actually post a threat?<br/><br/>The acting is slightly better this time, and the overall tone is less serious, but it's OK to me (with more comedic moments). However, the movie is still too long, and there are obviously scenes that could be cut out of the movie. Don't worry though, it still isn't half as bad as Watchmen.<br/><br/>You should also be aware of the fact that the movie had more robot gunfights than car chases. You'll spend 60% of the time on watching robots fighting with cannons. It isn't something I embrace though, as you can watch better gunfights in WW2 movies.<br/><br/>Overall speaking, it's a nice movie, but nothing close to awesome, nothing close to great. But it's okay and acceptable. Just don't expect much out of it."

","The first live action Transformers film, just like any other film by director Michael Bay, yielded mixed opinions though most were at least entertained by it. With the sequel, Revenge of the Fallen, we see the film playing to its predecessors' strengths and weaknesses very largely, but the general scenario (in regards to judging the film) has changed a bit. In some ways this helps the film, while in others it's hindered by this.<br/><br/>Revenge of the Fallen's plot is simply all over the place, mostly due to the constant shift in settings. The starting point of the story is that the Autobots are now helping humans track down other Decepticons with Sam going to college and having to deal with Bumblebee, his girlfriend and one of this parents being more...unconventional than usual. But things only wind up getting more messy for Sam as the situation with the Autobots starts going in a not-so hot direction. By the time the film has ended, the viewer has gone and visited Sam's house, a college, a military base, airplane museum and Egypt.<br/><br/>While the film's plot does have more substance than its predecessor (which, granted, isn't exactly a challenge), it doesn't flow out nearly as smoothly, with practically every essential plot point being delivered very briefly and over-stressed without elaboration. In some ways, it almost feels as if the film doesn't care about losing the audience in its plot details, though anyone who pays attention, has seen the first film and is even faintly familiar with the original back-story shouldn't have too much trouble keeping up.<br/><br/>Stories are not where Bay has ever succeeded at, but rather the action is what he's noted for. And here, just like Transformers from 2007, the action is big, loud and overzealous. In fact, this film is to its predecessor what Gears of War 2 was to its predecessor action-wise: bigger, better and more bad-ass. The action has been captured much better than before, though it isn't without a few random explosions and ""chaos cuts"" that ultimately show nothing. That said, everything in these sequences are quite impressive to look at and are guaranteed to make the viewer's eyes pop. What most will likely remember is the rumble in the forest during the middle of the film, it's definitely the best scene in the film.<br/><br/>A few other select areas have seen a bit of improvement, but only slightly. The acting is a small step above that of the first one (with some obvious exceptions), the Transformers are properly given more screen time than the first film and there are a couple nice throwbacks to the original TV show (Starscream + Megatron=Not so pretty scenario).<br/><br/>However, there are also areas the film still falters on and, even in parts that are improved from the first, still hold it back. What most will likely hold against this film the most (and already have) is how the runtime really drags on a lot more this time around (despite only being six minutes longer). Even during action scenes the film's length will definitely show its cracks, which has made many already dislike the film. And while the acting is a step above the first film, this isn't to say it's good, and once again, the machines have more/better personalities than the humans (well, generally, the twins aren't exactly what I'd call ""necessary inclusions"").<br/><br/>This also brings up the amount of Transformers we see in the film, which has hit a pretty large number. However, many of these inclusions don't feel in the least bit necessary and others who could've (and should've) been emphasized/fleshed out more were barely included (I can only recall Ratchet having one brief, quiet line). If anything, the film details the Decepticons side almost as much, if not a bit more than the Autobots (though fans of the show probably won't mind this). Some of the machines we see in the film impress us (with one near the end being, well, big), though for every likable one there seems to be another than we could've easily done without.<br/><br/>While there's a lot that can be complained about in Revenge of the Fallen, it's still very possible to like and enjoy it. There's a greater sense of urgency with the higher stakes presented in the film, we see more of the Transformers themselves this time around (finally getting a bit of real screen time), the attempts at comedic scenes, while still falling flat, aren't nearly as lousy as those in the first film and again, the action is quite entertaining and is usually impressive (with some interesting twists here and there).<br/><br/>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a film that will likely cater to only select viewers who are tolerable of long run-times and lacking (to say the least) plot lines. For my money, I'd say it's better than its predecessor despite still having some key issues, but it's a tough recommendation since there are a lot of easy turn-offs present throughout. If you go into this film expecting mindless action, you'll get enough of that, but your endurance may very well be tested and it's pretty much given you'll get more than you bargained for (whether this turns out to be good or bad is entirely subjective). I myself enjoyed the film very much despite its flaws and will likely watch it again down the line."

","Transformers 2 does not disappoint as a summer popcorn movie. It has all the ingredients for a summer blockbuster; a good fan base from the first movie, great special effects, and a popular cast. However, Transformers 2 was just a good movie and not a great movie, which it very well could have been.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is good and sets up the story quite nicely but the story that is set up does not get a chance to fully develop throughout the movie. The reason is because Michael Bay can't decide on what to focus on. Does he make this an action movie? A dramatic movie? An action/comedy? There are too many different movie elements in Transformers 2.<br/><br/>Some of the problems were the inclusion of too many low brow jokes in the movie. There is a scene involving Sam Witwicky's mother shortly after arriving at college that should not have been in the movie. It wasn't very funny and did not contribute to the advancement of the plot. These jokes throughout the movie take up screen time where dialogue explaining the plot and advancing the story should have been.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 builds on the stories from the history of the Autobots and Decepticons, but those stories are not sufficiently explained and too much has to be assumed. The stories still make some sense and does not make the plot confusing or impossible to follow, but it makes the story seem incomplete.<br/><br/>Where the first Transformers movie thrived on a strong story and good action scenes, Transformers 2 relies on just action scenes. <br/><br/>I did give this movie a 7 because the story was still good. The action scenes were enjoyable to watch and the acting was well done. Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson did great with their supporting roles as soldiers. It is easy for everyone to try to vie for the spotlight in such a big budget movie, but those two played their roles very well which is one of the reasons this movie was good.<br/><br/>Transformers 2 also uses many elements from the original television series and some from Transformers: The Movie (1986). That made the movie more enjoyable as it was more in tune with the Transformers many of the fans grew up with. Bumblebee is still a lovable robot and Optimus Prime is still everyone's favorite leader. Megatron and the Decpticons are still just as evil as we all remember and the transformation of the beloved 80's cartoon series to a live action big screen film is just as amazing as the first one. <br/><br/>Once you walk out of the theater a few things will stick in your mind. Optimus Prime is still a bad-ass and a terrific movie hero, the special effects were great and so were the action scenes, and Megan Fox is gorgeous. But, maybe the most important thing a movie should leave you imprinted with is not stuck in your mind and that is an intricate story that you want to see over and over again... maybe just twice, I know I'll probably see it again"
