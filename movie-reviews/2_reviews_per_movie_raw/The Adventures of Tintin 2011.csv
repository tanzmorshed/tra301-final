"creepysammich","Null","480","553","13 October 2011"," An intrepid report on The Adventures of Tintin
","First off, this is the first time I ever write a review in here. For once, I felt compelled to do it because... Well... because I'm Belgian and grew up on a steady Tintin diet, like most Belgians my age and older. The comics... not the cartoons. Needless to say I'm a old fan.<br/><br/>I also happen to be a fan of Spielberg's, probably since seeing E.T. when I was about 5 years old. The two could be mutually exclusive. I could take the role of the harcore comics fan who despises the adaptation, or the rabid Spielby fan forgiving everything. <br/><br/>Thankfully, after having the chance to see it before most people out here in Belgium and everywhere else thanks to a journalist buddy, I found out I can to be none of the above. Spielberg and Jackson and all the team behind the adaptation obviously gave the original material the love and respect it deserved, while making it their own.<br/><br/>To clarify the origins of the story itself, you have to know that it isn't the adaptation of one, but three Tintin comics. Its beginning takes root in ""Le Crabe aux Pinces D'or"", while the rest of the movie revolves around the two-albums story of the hunt for Rakham the Red's treasure, ""Le Secret de la Licorne"" and ""Le Trésor de Rakham le Rouge"". While it could seem like a lot of material for a whole movie, the choice of blending those three (two and a half) stories together turns out giving the movie a rather perfect pacing. <br/><br/>To kill a double controversy in the making, and like I've already read in a couple critics: Tintin has always been a ""bland"" character in the comics. He has no asperities. He is brave, always gets out of the tangles he gets in, he is a good guy, he doesn't know doubts... Tintin as a character has his limits, dramatically speaking, and even Hergé knew that... It is actually the reason for the appearance of Captain Haddock after a few albums. Haddock is the dark side of Tintin, prone to anger and shouting insults, hard drinker, natural born loser... Far from a being just a comical sidekick, Haddock is the human counterpart to the flawless hero that Tintin is (remember, this is a comic, originally aimed at kids and older kids). The movie has the intelligence of starting off the big screen adventures of Tintin with the two meeting up and becoming friends, a real turning point in the continued adventures of Tintin. <br/><br/>The movie also deftly skips what could have been a typically Hollywoodish mistake of giving Tintin exposition. But none of that nonsense here. Tintin is a reporter, that's all you need to know. That's all the comics ever told us about him. None of them ever showed Tintin doing actual reporter work. I don't think he ever used a typewriter, he has no boss, no workplace. Tintin just finds himself where adventure is. Because he's a reporter. Hergé never needed more, kudos for the guys behind this movie for keeping true to that. It will be held against them, but that will be coming from people who don't know the original material. <br/><br/>But I somehow had little worries about that, honestly. It was only obvious they wouldn't touch the spirit of what's considered a classic worldwide. Well, not those guys. I had more doubts about the transition from Hergé's ""Ligne Claire"" type of drawing to CGI's and even more so to the use of 3D. And that's where I was truly impressed. Not that I'm adverse to CGIs, mind. In fact it's the cartoons that bred those doubts in me. The varied 2D, celluloid adventures of Tintin always bugged me, because of that transition from the seemingly simple but incredibly dynamic looks of the books, looking so wrong when brought to animated life. Yet the movie did a great job of shutting up the Tintin geek. It simply looks stunning, and your mind easily jumps back and forth between forgetting these are cartoon characters and appreciating their transition to a 3D environment, respectful of the original designs but literally bringing them to life. <br/><br/>In short, all these elements drew me to the same conclusion, Spielby and co. managed to deal a great adaptation. One that has true respect for the original material, and the great ambition of adding something to it. Yes, not everything of it. ""Le Crabe aux Pinces D'or"" could have deserved a whole movie. Shortcuts are taken, and as true to their originals as they are, the characters have been redesigned. But in the end you have a movie that can be appreciated both by fans of the comics as well as people who have ""just heard about them"". It is fun, packed with adventure and action, enjoyable at all ages. And most of all, you can go see it without having to worry about seeing another piece of Hollywood-flavoured perversion, a fast-foodified betrayal. If that's what you like, note, there's been that Smurf thing, recently (another childhood favourite). You know, that other Belgian comics adaptation that took the little blue dudes from their tiny corner of European medieval forest to... Modern New York? But if you have more gourmet tastes, better bet your money on Jackson and Spielberg. Trust this true childhood Tintin fan."

","I never saw the original Tintin cartoons and before this film new nothing about it.<br/><br/>I watched this film this evening, two years after its release .. and i'm left thinking, why did I not watch this film before now?! <br/><br/>This was such an enjoyable film, it was much, much better than i thought it was going to be, there are so many great things about this movie:<br/><br/>THE VISUALS: Easily one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen, i wish i had watched this at the cinema - especially in 3d. The animation is perfect. it's bright, colourful and scarily lifelike. The characters, scenery and landscapes all look incredible and so creative. Even the opening credits look fantastic! I can't stress how good the visuals are in this film.<br/><br/>THE DIRECTION: Spielberg has done an incredible job here, nothing could have been improved in this aspect. The way the movie flows and the way the scenes intertwine and change is beautiful. There are scenes where it switches from past to present and back again in such a way that you just get lost in it.. you will understand what i mean when you see the movie. There are scenes of fights and chases which are so creative and so imaginative, the way he uses angles and the way everything links on is a real joy to watch. Its hard to explain, watch the film and you will know exactly what I mean.<br/><br/>However, the film is not just a visual feast like many films are. It has a good solid story with likable, interesting characters - I found the story line kept my attention throughout. A very original adventure/quest film, searching for hidden treasure and defeating the bad guys along the way!<br/><br/>I cannot recommend this film enough, i was so surprised by just how good it was. As i said earlier I am sorry I didn't go and see this in the cinema as it really would have been a fantastic experience. <br/><br/>Watch it!"

"info-130-288696","Null","210","286","16 October 2011"," ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is quintessentially the perfect family film: incredibly joyous, thrilling and comically genius adventure.
","Before his passing in 1983, Hergé said that if any filmmaker was to adapt his collection of timeless tales following the adventures of a Belgian reporter to the big screen, Steven Spielberg was the only man for the job, and after two decades of trial and error, the cinematic version of Tintin has finally reached our screens with the desired director at its helm. Alongside Spielberg sits Lord of the Rings (2001-2003) maestro Peter Jackson as producer and three of Britain's brightest writers (Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish) who have that almost impossible task of translating the stories from comic strips to 35mm. This 3D motion-capture and CGI extravaganza combines three of Tintin's most beloved outings (The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure) and hits UK multiplexes just before the school half-term.<br/><br/>After discovering an elegant model of the ship the 'Unicorn' at a market, Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) and his loyal dog Snowy are intrigued as to why so many desire it, and comment on the secrets it holds. When the model is stolen, more information surfaces and the pair set out to discover the truth, teaming up, after a surprise meeting, with the boisterous drunkard Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis). The group's adventure spans the globe, with each destination bringing more danger and that crucial step closer towards unravelling the mystery.<br/><br/>From the moment the picture opens, the film's tone and mood is set: mystery and adventure merged with fun and frolics. The classy, hand-drawn, animated titles use the signature silhouette imagery with style and sophistication, making the wit and wonder evident even before audiences have graced their eyes on the monumental motion capture work.<br/><br/>In a rather lacklustre year for animation, with the only true blossom of beauty being Studio Ghibli's impeccable 'Arrietty', Spielberg's latest thankfully ends this dry-run with a picture that explodes with vibrancy, craftsmanship and realism. Unlike Robert Zemeckis' motion-capture entries (The Polar Express [2004] and A Christmas Carol [2009]); The Adventures of Tintin is an entirely different bunch of blistering blue barnacles – every frame enforces impeccable detail and naturalism, and like the best animated pictures, viewers will forget they are watching digitalised representations in no time. Whether the visuals are mind-blowing as in the all-important action sequences – or brilliantly subtle – like the red, sweat-streaked cheeks and brows of Tintin and Haddock as they trek through a desert – this film is a clear example of just how magnificent technology is in this day and age.<br/><br/>Without a shadow of a doubt this is the year's finest animated entry – expect an Oscar nomination and a deserved win. As well as its tremendous visual flair, the feature's script is a revelation: beautifully written and whimsical dialogue that is frequently hilarious and manages to merge the three classic tales so seamlessly. Considering Hergé's stories are separate volumes, the typing trio behind this movie are able to make a sensible structure with the texts, making the film flow as gracefully as its perfect imagery. As well as the laughs, the script provides great character development for those new to the world of Tintin without insulting audiences with an hour's lesson. Young children will have no trouble picking up who's who in the early stages, before settling back for the incredible roller coaster ride of the second and climatic act.<br/><br/>Action fans will gain greatness from this movie too. Expect high octane chases, pirate swordplay and more bullets than a Sylvester Stallone entry – just a lot less gore and swearing. In fact, although The Adventures of Tintin is action-packed, its PG certificate is justified; I cannot recall anything remotely damaging or frightening for young eyes, so parents have nothing to fear with this one when deciding on their half-term picture.<br/><br/>The film also sees the much needed return of composer John Williams who provides yet another dazzling and effective score. The music captures the essence of the film in an instant and compliments it throughout.<br/><br/>The voice casting is collectively brilliant with Bell and Serkis being the obvious standouts. Bell's inquisitive tone and frequent high-pitched bursts mirror the speech bubbles Tintin utters in the comic panels. When reading a Hergé story, this is exactly how the character sounds in your head. Serkis steals the show as Captain Haddock and is given splendid dialogue to growl through bitter Scottish chords. Haddock's often stupid remarks and forgetfulness is beautifully represented through the animated character. Daniel Craig is also fantastic as the less-than-trustworthy Ivanovich Sakharine while Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are side-splitting as the lovable policing dunces Thomson and Thompson. Plus Snowy is absolutely wonderful.<br/><br/>There is no doubt that Spielberg's adaptation will be top of the box office upon release and hopefully those new to Tintin will be influenced to re-visit the books and television shows of yesteryear and become more involved with one of the century's most beloved and important literary creations.<br/><br/>Verdict:  'The Adventures of Tintin' is quintessentially the perfect family film and has plenty to offer audiences of all ages. This is an incredibly joyous, thrilling and comically genius adventure. Hergé was onto a winner with his thoughts towards Spielberg and he can rest easy now knowing his tales have been faithfully and beautifully translated into a cinematic masterwork. Great Snakes, it's good."
"aaronjbong","10","129","173","11 November 2011"," This is a Splendid Re-creation!
","Since 1981, Spielberg has become an avid fan of this gorgeous ""Tintin"" comics and has been longing to create a film about it. Before he and ""Tintin's"" master, Herge could meet, Herge passed away. However, Herge's widow decided to give them the rights and began the adventure to re-create this marvelous wonder of art.<br/><br/>Adapted from three of the comics, Spielberg's re-creation of the comics introduces us to Tintin (Jamie Bell), a Belgian reporter who gets caught up in all sorts of adventures. One day, he found a model of a ship, the Unicorn and bought it and brought it home. However, when Tintin was buying the ship, two men came to try to buy the model, Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and Barnaby. Later, Tintin discovers that the model holds an important secret and somehow, the secret is linked to the real ship itself. On the way for answers, he meets the grumpy Haddock and head off to an adventure spanning around the globe with his white fluffy dog Snowy.<br/><br/>The animation is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. It's not right to call it a CGI film as the motion of the characters are much smoother than that of CGI films. Tintin's animated self looks stunning (even though he looks kind of different from his comic-self) in his blue long sleeves. Snowy is fluffier than ever. Captain Haddock is grumpier than ever. All of the animation is simply breathtaking and the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I like how they change scenes. While most other movies just shift scenes normally, this film uses a little imagination and is ingenious in shifting scenes. They can change from a scene of shaking hands to a desert scene by using the outline of the two hands into the surface of the desert. This thing is just entertaining and great in its own right and deserves some reward.<br/><br/>The movie itself is fun to watch. The story is compelling, the lines are natural-sounding, and the action is plenty of fun to watch. It is great excitement to watch and I was hooked from beginning to end. Great plot + awesome action + breathtaking animation equals up to amazing movie.<br/><br/>The 3D is perfectly fine. The depth is seen and the 3D just makes the movie even more fun to watch.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend you to watch this film. ""Tintin"" fan or no, this is sheer fun to watch. If this movie is out in your country, watch it immediately. For U.S. citizens, I'm sorry if you still have to wait for a while but I promise you, this is like no other movie. This movie is over the top and is plenty of fun to watch. A full 10 out of 10! Thanks for reading my review on ""The Adventures of Tintin"". I do hope this review is of good use to you."
"Lyra-gp","10","159","231","25 October 2011"," Riding and Remembering the shivers of an adventurous childhood
","When about a year ago, at the supermarket, I saw on the Empire magazine's cover the 3D reproduction of one of my childhood's toon-idols my eyes popped out. 'WHO is directing WHAT???' - the question that echoed in my mind: It was a bit of shock finding out that one of my favorite directors was working on a movie from a character I considered buried under the dusts of time. The astonishment was soon replaced by excitement and I made the way back home from the supermarket hopping and smiling. <br/><br/>Today I decided to take an adventurous break from my dull academic life and went to the cinema to watch it. No wonder the room was almost full, despite the fact that the movie will be officially released tomorrow. As soon as the opening credits appeared on the screen I felt a shiver of excitement running through my spine as I was visually meeting an old friend from my childhood again; to my pleasure I felt the same sensations I would feel when I was a child. That's one of the VERY good points of this production: the spirit of Herge's Tintin, in Spielberg's movie, remains UNALTERED. There are some cases, though, in which the characters are even better and more deeply characterized than in the comic strips. <br/><br/>OK, let's release now all the excitement about this movie. If I had just five short seconds to say how I think this movie is I'd chose 7 words: Mesmerising from the beginning to the end. That's quite true if you consider that even the opening credits are little shining pearls of direction and creativity. <br/><br/>The general impression you get from this movie, talking about direction, is that nothing could have been better. Spielberg's direction is, in this case as well, a real warranty of general great quality. Three things I particularly appreciated: -The movie flows perfectly; it is kind of a pleasure for your eyes and for your brain to follow the adventure. -There's literally a STORM of brain-waves (and here comes the Spielberg's touch); especially, in the connection phases between one scene and the other the director totally expresses his genius, turning the open ocean into a pond, making two shaking hands become dunes in the desert and so on (you'll understand what I mean when you'll watch the movie) -The 'camera's movements' literally pull you into the movie and you can't help feeling excited or scared according to the situation.<br/><br/>You can tell it's a Spielberg's movie even just looking at these things.<br/><br/>Although all the things I have listed until now are enough to candidate the movie as the best movie of the year (in my opinion) there's still something I must remember: The quality of animation. I really could not find a proper term to define my astonishment when my eyes approached the beautiful places and landscapes shown in the movie. They look perfect, shining and bursting with emotions, sensations; they almost look like paintings: For instance, there's a sunset in the movie that I will hardly forget. It's the same with the CGI models: you can see the wrinkles on the character's faces, even their sweat. <br/><br/>Furthermore, some words about the actors: Bells and Serkis are maybe the sole two living beings who could have given birth to the cinematographic version of the two main characters. The first succeeds in the hard challenge to provide the audience with a convincing and faithful interpretation of the beloved protagonist (he did A GREAT job indeed), the second is a delightful surprise again, with a funny Scottish accent and a very good interpretation. <br/><br/>One last word goes to one of the best composer alive: Sir John Williams. There's nothing to do, every piece of music he creates is able to touch the deepest strings of our hearts. With a soundtrack (already bought at the HMV store) that ranges from the epic tones to the mysterious ones he gives us another example of his limitless genius, because he still remains one of those composers able to make us cry.<br/><br/>Finally, Tintin - The Secret of the Unicorn, is one of the greatest surprises of the year. Another great adventure in the archive of the most spectacular stories of humanity, told by a MASTER story-teller (Spielberg). A movie you will hardly forget."
"Sevenmercury7","9","112","162","24 October 2011"," A rollicking good adventure
","What begins as a fun, nimble little mystery in the first act soon kicks into comedy-action-adventure high gear when junior reporter Tintin, with his brave dog Snowy, stumbles upon boozy Captain Haddock (an excellent Andy Serkis), whose family legacy may prove pivotal in a race to uncover the secret of the Unicorn.<br/><br/>From that point on, it's more or less non-stop comedy—some fizzles, most of it works—with gags ranging from jaw-dropping blockbuster chase antics to throwaway background humour. Captain Haddock works brilliantly for the most part: he's unpredictable, endearing, and colourful in all the ways Tintin himself isn't. While the youngster is well played by Jamie Bell, he's mostly just there to work out the clues for the audience. Tintin and Haddock make for a good double-act, though: brains and brawn, cunning and in-over-his-head rashness; together they'd make a good Indiana Jones. <br/><br/>The plot is a by the numbers mystery/adventure/treasure hunt, complete with bumbling detectives (so-so comic support from Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), exciting sea plane action and hidden clues, but it's brought to life in gorgeous visual style. While the script only comes alive in fits and starts, the whole film is bursting with rich detail, and is given added depth by a good, solid use of 3D. The virtual camera-work throughout is stupendous.<br/><br/>One extended chase sequence through the flooding streets of a North African city is so dazzling and dizzying it reminded me why no other filmmaker can match Spielberg when he lets his imagination out for a spin. Another action scene, told in flashback, depicts a breathless pirate showdown in a storm, and features some of the most playful transitions I've seen since Ang Lee's Hulk. There's a pretty good villain, too, played by a wily Daniel Craig.<br/><br/>Snowy, while definitely smarter than your average cute canine, is also given to chasing cats, digging up fossilised bones from the desert, and gobbling sandwiches at decidedly inopportune moments. In other words, he's an instant audience favourite.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a rollicking good adventure, one of Spielberg's most fun movies in a long time, and I'll be buying it on Blu-ray next year."
"DrunkUniStudent","8","150","221","22 October 2011"," A Great film for all ages
","I went to see this film in a free screening and took my nephew and niece with me, seeing as it was a family film to try and get different reactions to the film.<br/><br/>Let me start off with my view of the film, I've been a fan of Tintin since I first saw the cartoon back in the early 90's, though never read the comics. When I saw the credits of who wrote, produced and directed the film, you think to yourself this film is going to be awesome, there is no way with all that talent they can't possible f**k this up (and they didn't). You have Spielberg directing, Peter Jackson as a producer. Also the writing team great with Steven Moffat, known for Sherlock, Dr who, Coupling and another of my child hood favs, Press Gang. Finally you have Edgar Wright, who wrote and directed Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World.<br/><br/>The version of the film i saw was 3d, as it was a preview and i didn't have a choice. Normally i watch all my showing in 2d as i think its personally a fad and a rip off and the films i have seen excluding Avatar, i didn't think the 3d aspect improved the film going enjoyment one bit. This again is my option while the 3d is nice, and the shots going through glass and water was really good, there was nothing else that would have me pulling out another £2 a ticket. I would have been happy with a basic 2d version.<br/><br/>On to the film story, TinTin (voice by Billy Elliott's Jamie Bell) buys a handmade ship in market. As soon as he buys it he gets a number of offers of people willing to buy it from him, which TinTtn rejects. When he gets home Snowy, Tintin dog, breaks the ship and a hidden clue rolls out, which begins Tintin trying to work out what it means. Tintin then gets kidnapped by the evil Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig), who is after the clue. This where Tintin mets up with Captain Haddock as they set of trying to work out the meaning of Tintin clue.<br/><br/>The film is a really mixture of action and adventure. We see the heroes on board ships, rowing boats, fly airplanes, riding camels, having car\bike chases and crane fights. The time flew past for me and not once did i feel bored, this was probably down to the amount going with the film, the quick pace of the action and the different locations of the characters were always in. It reminded me of the Indiana Jones films a lot, where he is on the hunt for treasure, and he only has half of the clues, and the bad guys have the others half and both sides are trying to get the other half for the themselves. He then needs to go around the globe via different transportation to get the info he needs to find the treasure.<br/><br/>There is also a large amount of humour in the film, seeing as Moffat, who wrote coupling helped write it, this is no big surprise. While i got the jokes neither my nephew (3) nor niece (8) did. So I am assuming that these were aim at the adults watching.<br/><br/>The characters the film makers can't chance much from the original Hergé comics, but Tintin I did find too goody goody, the captain is great character, who is drunk loser, but has a kind heart and wants to do the right thing. The bad guy, Sakharine, is perfect, scary enough to make you believe that he is ruthless killer who is a greedy and after revenge, but on the other had not going over board to make the kids feel scared or afraid of him when he was on screen. There is also the two comic relief characters of inspector Thomson, who are on screen just enough to make you smile at the pratfalls and their stupidness, but not too long for the jokes to wear thin so you're sick of seeing them.<br/><br/>My rating of the film would be 4 out of 5.<br/><br/>On to the kids view of the film. 1st my nephew who is 3 years old (4 in November). He told me he liked the film a lot especially the pirate bits, but he didn't understand why the pirates were bad. He also said he liked the motorcycle chase because the bikes were cool. As i was sitting next to him i could tell the film was slightly too long for him as he started to fidgit a bit in the last 15 mins.<br/><br/>My niece who is 8 (9 in December), i didn't get a lot of information from her, when i asked if she liked all her answer was yes it was good, and when i asked what her favourite bit was, she told me all of it.<br/><br/>As a reference for taking children during the half term break, i would say 4 and under while enjoy the film like my nephew did, but they won't fully understand the plot of the film or why certain things are happening, but for 5 years old and up this film and adults included this is a must see."
"jan_kalina","8","86","125","30 October 2011"," ""I will find that ship. With or without your help!""
","And Steven Spielberg has found that ship and that ship has sailed him to a brand new technology for filmmaking. Yes, I'm talking about motion capture or as Spielberg calls it ""perfomance"" capture. This technology is a like a new toy for Steven. You can feel the joy for filmmaking from every shot, every detail. He plays with the camera in a way he never could while making a live-action film. For example in probably the best scene of the film the main character, Tintin is gliding on a wire and the camera is following him throughout the whole scene in a continuous shot. But you can still say, you still see that this is a Spielberg movie. You know this is a Spielberg movie since the opening title credits that will remind you a lot of the opening credits in Catch Me If You Can. Even the music is very similar.<br/><br/>The main character is Tintin, who is a journalist who we never see doing any journalism though, but that doesn't matter because he is the textbook example of a heroic boy with boy scout qualities. The voice of Jamie Bell fits perfectly for the character. Andy Serkis gives here an incredible performance as Captain Haddock, the drunken sailor who to me was often reminiscent of a grumpy Harrison Ford. The story did seem as too much centered on Captain Haddock though, you could even say this should have been called ""The Adventures of Captain Haddock"" instead of Tintin. Daniel Craig is unrecognizable as the main villain Sacharine. Although his voice did jump to his normal voice in one line but otherwise you didn't know it was him. Of course I can't forget to mention the lovable dog, Snowy. He steals almost every scene that he is in. He is very realistic, he acts like a real dog and even gets his own chase scene. I'm telling you will adore this dog.<br/><br/>The animation is magnificent, the motion capture has gone a long way since The Polar Express. It looks very realistic, especially all the features on Captain Haddock's face. The beard, the wrinkles and the eyes, they all looked amazing. Especially the eyes, they aren't so dead-eyed anymore as in The Polar Express.<br/><br/>The action scenes are brilliantly written and directed, the angles of the camera, the drive of the action scenes, timing of all the jokes(physical or visual) is genius. Because Spielberg is a genius. He is the master of adventure movies and there never will be another genius in adventure movies like him.<br/><br/>Overall Spielberg has created an old-fashioned style adventure movie for the whole family to enjoy,where the important things are just the hunt for the treasure, the friendship two people can make and the most important thing of all that it is an entertaining ride. Spielberg never disappoints, it doesn't matter if you are a fan of Tintin or not, you will enjoy this film nonetheless"
"keuhkokala","Null","78","118","20 October 2011"," Blistering Barnacles! The adventure film of the year!
","Having grown up with the Tintin comic books, I was doubtful of this project. I'm not a fan of the motion-capture technology and I feared the world created by Hergé would be sanitized for American audiences. But there was no need to worry. Tintin is a funny, exciting and tremendously entertaining adventure movie. It's also Spielberg's most entertaining film since Jurassic Park.<br/><br/>Tintin (Jamie Bell) is a young reporter who gets tangled in the affairs of smugglers when he buys a model ship from a scrap meet. When he gets kidnapped to the smugglers' ship, he meets Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis). He's a pure-hearted old drunk, who has information on a great treasure, told as a legend in his family for generations. He just needs to get sober enough to remember it. The adventure takes the pair to the Atlantic, Sahara, Morocco and finally back home. Tintin lives in an unmentioned European city that could be Brussels, London or any other one that has a sea port, really.<br/><br/>True to the comics, Tintin himself doesn't really have any strong characteristics. So it stands to reason that the minor characters steal the film again and again. Captain Haddock's alcoholism may not be suitable for the younger children, but it provides some of the film's most hilarious jokes. Almost as good are Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as bumbling Interpol detectives Thompson and Thomson. Familiar faces from the comics pop up now and then, but don't overcrowd the film. The focus is still on the main characters.<br/><br/>Even the 3D isn't just a distraction, as Spielberg has truly gone off his way to make use for the technology. Action scenes are shot with a long single shot, where the camera goes around to wild angles. There's a strong sense of being in on the action and forgetting you even are wearing a pair of painful glasses. The film takes a while to pick off steam at first, but after that the action varies from pirate battles to crane fights. The most outstanding scene is the motorcycle chase near the end, which would give Indiana Jones a run for his money.<br/><br/>The film's story is faithful to the comic book, and thus ends promising more. I hope there will be, because I was willing to follow Tintin and Haddock on new adventures straight away! I'd say it's among the best, the most innovative comic-book films with Sin City and Scott Pilgrim vs. The World. The film is excellent escapism from the dreary day-to-day life and it made me smile for the rest of the day."

","Even if you've never heard of the Tintin character, let alone read the classic Herge comics, this movie of his adventures is terrific from start to finish, complete with invigorating characters, dazzling effects (special and otherwise), exotic settings, and unabashed, wall-to-wall exhilaration and excitement. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell) is a young-lad reporter who, apparently, finds himself in extraordinary situations with some frequency. While shopping in a local market, he purchases a model boat called the Unicorn. Almost immediately, Tintin and his faithful canine friend Snowy are pursued by the mysterious Mr. Sakharine (Daniel Craig), ostensibly so that the latter can complete his collection. But of course that's not the real reason, is it? No, he's after more, much more. It all has to do with the Unicorn's real-life namesake and what happened to it (scuttled at sea) and, more importantly, what it carried. Right off, Tintin (okay, Snowy) discovers a scroll hidden in the model's mast that may be a clue to something bigger - but there are two other scrolls.<br/><br/>It's an old-fashioned treasure hunt. Tintin runs into a frequently inebriated Captain Haddock (voice of Andy Serkis), who has a strong connection to the original Unicorn and to the scrolls themselves. With Haddock and Snowy at his side, Tintin races across the globe to solve the mystery before Sakharine, a journey that takes him to multiple continents, fighting bad guys with swords, guns, fists, and feet. It's a throwback movie; a movie quite similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, itself a throwback to the serials of the early 20th century. And, of course, the director here is one Steven Spielberg, whom you might recognize as a progenitor of that Raiders universe himself.<br/><br/>The movie is animated, both literally and figuratively, and the animation is so exquisitely realistic that it's easy to perceive it as completely lifelike. The action is intense and relentless, but because of the depth of detail in the animation, it's tough to imagine it as anything other than a terrific live-action film. When Tintin leaps from building to building or from a moving car, we actually cringe - can he make it? <br/><br/>Here's an added bonus - apparently, the movie is very close to the source material. Tintin has not been updated or modified to mollify new audiences; remember, so many Americans have never heard of the intrepid reporter. And there's no time waste on explaining who Tintin is, or what he is, or how old he's supposed to be. You know why? Because it's irrelevant, that's why. He's just an adventuring dude with a smart dog and a lot of panache. <br/><br/>Bell, Serkis, and Craig are all superb in their roles (the latter two have dual roles each). Simon Pegg and Nick Frost show up as Interpol agents named Thompson and Thompson and offer excellent comic relief; are they bumbling, or are they just that good? It's the latter.<br/><br/>There really is so much to like about this movie, and it's one of those rare films that can be recommended not only to children in general but to girls and boys alike. It's artful, engaging, fascinating, and wonderful to behold."
"rangdetumpy","Null","57","86","21 December 2011"," The film doesn't completely work for Tintin loyalists (like me who rates the Tintin Comic Books 11/10)
","Billions of blue blistering barnacles, Ten thousand thundering typhoons – for a whole generation these were the epitome of cuss words thanks to Captain Haddock. I am one of those in late 20s who grew up reading ( mugging to be precise as Thomson & Thompson would have said) Tintin and almost worship Herge for the genius intelligent stories created in the black and white times of our grandpas. Being an hardcore Tintin loyalist the excitement to see the boy sleuth of screen was certainly brewing high. But the movie left me wanting more. It left a mixed reaction in me and here I come one by one at different levels.<br/><br/>Story Level – Hollywood have adapted many novels for big screen and most of the times it has failed to recreate the finesse of the original work. Spielberg's rendition of Tintin somehow managed a mixed reaction in terms of story. Firstly selecting ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" make sense as that shows the boy sleuth meeting the gold hearted Captain Haddock for the first time and in the first encounter Tintin comes face to face with the perennial drinking habit of Captain. ""The crab with the golden claws"" had enough spice for a full fledged film but may be Spielberg wanted some adventure which prompted him to juggle with ""The secret of the unicorn"" and ""the crab with the golden claws"" thus making a concatenation of two stories. Personally I felt that the two stories have been woven wisely with liberty taken in creating an ancestral fight between Captain Francis Haddock and Pirate Red Rackham. Somehow the cocktail was well crafted with the story oscillating between two original books. But the second half was outright outlandish as Spielberg merges his own imagination in creating a full fledged action film which took away the essence of Tintin. The subtlety, intelligence were missing as the director chose to make a 80s Bollywoodish action climax which had no connection to the original one. Moreover the movie ended in the way the comic book ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" ends yet Spielberg hinted a sequel which is related to Red Rackham's treasure. That shows the sequel will be a total new story by Spielberg (or Peter Jackson) with touches of original. It will be strictly for those who have no idea of what actual Tintin is all about. I mean Spilberg could have named it anything Tom Dick and Harry if not Tintin specially for the second half.<br/><br/>Character Level – Spielberg is almost perfect in designing the characters. The look and the way the screen Tintin reacts brings in nostalgia of childhood days when we imagined (and discussed amongst friends) how Tintin would have behaved if made on screen. The attire to expression was all nicely done. Same goes for Snowy, the cute loyal dog of Tintin who can fight with the goons to save his beloved master. In fact children will fall in love with Snowy after watching this film. In one of the scene when Tintin gets kidnapped Snowy follows the car of the goons to the ship were Tintin was deported. The scene indeed brings out the pathos and concern inside Snowy for his master. Coming to Captain Haddock the characterization isn't as perfect as the comic book. The laziness and craziness in the first half were apt but then Captain fighting in the second half is too hard to digest. The detective duo Thompson and Thomson is appropriate and so is famous nightingale singer Bianca Castaphiore. But Spielberg should have included the verbal fights between Castaphiore and Haddock though he hinted Haddock and Snowy's disgust for Castaphiore's opera. Coming to the villains I am not convinced of Sachcharin as the main villain. The original had Bird Brothers as the villain duo which was more convincing than the screen one. In fact if they wanted to include a dreaded notorious villain then Rastapopulous (the evergreen big nosed enemy of Tintin) would have been the right choice. Even malicious Captain Allan has been relegated to side kick of Sachcharin. Captain Francis Haddock and Red Rackham's characters were true to the original book and it worked well.<br/><br/>Technical Level :- Frankly speaking the 3D effects were disappointing though the animation was top notch. The shadows and the structures created the by gone era with utmost precision. The fight sequence between Captain Francis Haddock and Red Rackham was one of the best sequences in the film. With brilliant camera-work and fine editing the scenes looked captivating on screen. Thought the fight sequences in the climax were loud for Tintin purist but at technical level those are a treat to watch and would be lapped by those who don't have a clue of ""actual"" Tintin. Dialogues were plain pedestrian and thanks to morality lectures by Captain it becomes ridiculous as a Tintin loyalist to sit through in the second half. As a director Spielberg has lost his midas touch long back which is echoed by this film again.<br/><br/>As a whole Adventure of Tintin started of brilliantly but lost its true sense with faulty narrative towards later half. Tintin loyalists would feel cheated but then they would still watch it for Nostalgia. Non-Tintin fans would lap it for the action. But believe me the Belgian reporter who resides in the heart of millions deserve a better on-screen representation thus doing justice to original masterpiece created by genius Herge. Whatever may be the fate of Spielberg's Tintin please go and read the original comic series. Each is brilliant in it's own way..On-screen or off-screen Tintin and Snowy rocks!! Tintin the film 6/10..Tintin the comic book 11/10"
"piratecannon","8","7","8","26 December 2012"," Spielberg Strikes Again
","When I learned that Steven Spielberg was tackling the beloved TinTin comic strips so as to make a feature film faithful to the source material, I was admittedly indifferent. I didn't read these particular comics as a kid, and I wasn't a fan of the Polar Express gloss that (I imagined) would lend an unwelcome veneer to what could have been a lively action movie a-la Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>I suppose I owe the venerable director an apology. The Adventures of Tintin thrives on its comic roots (as opposed to being hindered by them), and the seamless transition viewers are treated to finds our not- so-innocent hero—he is carrying a pistol, after all—globe-trotting between some truly spectacular action sequences that are directly reminiscent of Spielberg's actioners of old.<br/><br/>The story we're presented with is a nifty little mixture of what I can only label a Holmes-esque detective story and a whip-crackin' adventure tale that—as many other critics have noted—takes some of its cues directly from Raiders of the Lost Ark. There are times where some of the action is a little too slapstick for my liking, but there's no getting around the fact that Spielberg once again showcases his bravado as a creator of ingenious thrill rides (the sort that, in my humble opinion, are often conspicuously absent in recent Hollywood fare).<br/><br/>Where the movie stumbles is in its decision to have the rosy-cheeked Tintin dole out lessons on alcoholism to a blissfully out-of-touch sea captain who exists for little more than comic relief. In fact, there's a particularly awkward scene where our protagonist barks at his sidekick at the mention of alcohol, only to never revisit the issue (and, in fact, to completely ignore it until said captain symbolically kicks a bottle of whiskey over the side of a slick pier.<br/><br/>This is small potatoes, though, because Tintin soars in almost every other aspect—in fact, one has to wonder if there's much more that Spielberg and company can do to perfect the formula that's made him the blockbuster mogul that he is.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a family movie with some teeth, Tintin is just what the doctor ordered. That's a nice contrast to the usually gooey stuff that crops up during most holiday seasons, isn't it?"
"thehairthieves","4","74","122","27 December 2011"," Could have been great
","I was really excited to see this film, as I'm a big fan of Tintin, both the comics and the TV series from the early 90s. I was also pleased to see that the American influence would be primarily limited to Steven Spielberg, with the cast being mostly British and also having Peter Jackson on board. Things started off quite well, with the film sticking closely to the comics and TV episodes, keeping a good pace which got me into the film early on. I was also very impressed with the motion-capture animation and the 3D effects, even if some of the characters didn't look quite right. <br/><br/>However, soon after Tintin and Haddock crashed in the desert, things started to go rapidly downhill. The key to this was the fact that the story suddenly veered off onto its own tangent, almost disregarding the original story and the fact it had based so much of itself on the originals up until that point. <br/><br/>What also infuriated me was the silliness of it. Of course, a film like this should have a dose of silliness, there's no question of that. But there was far too much, which really ruined it for me. The climactic scene of the duel in the cranes is a prime example of this. It was just too silly for me to take it seriously. Not only that, but this would never have been in one of Herge's original stories. <br/><br/>My last gripe is that the film seemed far too long, particularly towards the end. A lot of scenes could have been either shortened or cut all together, as they didn't further the plot or provide anything to the enjoyment. This is another reason why I didn't enjoy the climax of the film, I was bored by the time it got around to it.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that this is a film which had great promise, as Tintin is perfect for an action-adventure movie, but the fact that a lot of the film ignores the original stories ruins any chances of that. I would say that any major deviation from the original stories should only have been done if absolutely necessary to make the film work."
"sdebeaubien","6","37","58","28 December 2011"," Just too.... ridiculous
","Aside from the badly stereotyped characters, and the overly ridiculous action sequences, I liked the movie, and thought it was OK. But, I just came away feeling like somebody had put me on a thrill ride and told me I was supposed to have fun and that I would come away feeling exhilarated but instead I came away feeling set up.<br/><br/>I just couldn't shake the feeling. My wife loved it, thought it was every bit the thrill ride. Well, I have to give it those moments. Visually it was very appealing. But then, I started wondering if I'd ever seen any of the original comics that this was based upon. Turns out I haven't seen those either. So, I won't downgrade it on the fact that apparently, it was not very true to the author's original intent.<br/><br/>Instead, it felt like Indiana Jones on steroids. It seemed to me they did things just because they could. You know what I mean, they took the type of silly Raider's stunts and had them move to the next level of ... difficulty. That's a poor word to describe action shots, but you get my drift. They just stretched it a bit too far I thought. Then, there's the plethora of silly characters who add nothing to the story but give us some bizarre attempt at comedy.<br/><br/>I liked the dog Snowy the best. As he had to be mainly a dog and be subject to some limitations, his portrayal in the movie was at least mostly believable. Not that a comic book should be believable or anything - it's just that I think I wanted to like Tintin and even to think he was a hero, but I couldn't because of all the far-fetched stuff happening around him and to him. Dueling cranes ... what next Mr. Spielberg, dancing hippos? Oh, no, Mr. Disney already did that."

","***WARNING*** CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!!!<br/><br/>I am a HUGE fan of the Tintin comics and have read them all countless times and was excited to hear that Steven Spielberg was making a movie based on one of my favorites: ""The Secret Of The Unicorn"". <br/><br/>After hearing some reviews from ""loyal"" Tintin fans I went to see this movie hoping that it would at least be OK. Boy was I wrong. Tintin has been betrayed people. Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson should be ashamed of themselves. It seems like they were so in love with their technological toys that they forgot the most important thing about the film - the story, the characters and respecting Herge. They have practically spat on the great man's grave with this horrible movie.<br/><br/>1) Story - Why did the writers find it necessary to mix three comics into one movie? The Secret of The Unicorn clearly has enough material to make an entertaining movie with Red Rackham's Treasure as a sequel. Sakharine was never a villain. Nor was he Red Rackham's relative (that really is retarded). Nor did he have a pet falcon. Nor was he obsessed with revenge on Haddock. He was simply an innocent antique collector. The Bird Brothers were great villains in the comic and the story had a lot of mystery and intrigue in it - which this movie has NONE. <br/><br/>2) Characters - This is where I hated this movie the most.<br/><br/>Haddock - How could they get this so wrong? Haddock comes off overacted, silly, unfunny and just plain annoying. I never knew whether he was drunk or sober. A distinction that is always made in the comics. And why the hell is he Scottish? There is a scene in the movie where the plane is running out of fuel so Haddock burps medical alcohol into the fuel tank of a plane. That is after the alcohol slipped out of the bottle and was floating in the plane like they were in space. When Sakharine threatens to kill Haddock I was hoping that he would...cause that Haddock was a jerk.<br/><br/>Tintin - So dull, annoying, lifeless and just frustrating. Tintin also did something in this movie that he never did in the comics. He gave up. And then Haddock does something that he never did in the comics. He gives some garbage speech about pushing through walls and being true to your self. What the hell?? NOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Please people go and buy a copy of ""Tintin in Tibet"". You will find that Tintin never gives up and Haddock does. That was about the 6th nail in the coffin for me but it was certainly the biggest.<br/><br/>This movie is nothing but boring Hollywood rubbish made by two men that ruined a great story and some great characters and made it into a typical American blockbuster filled with CGI and special effects crap. It is not fun and it is not interesting. The special effects and CGI are not a big deal and I don't know what the fuss is all about with the Baghaar chase scene - I couldn't even tell what was going on, it was like a pinball machine. Tintin was never about action scenes or CGI. Tintin was always about the story and the characters and that is what people fell in love with when reading the comics. And that is what has been screwed up the most in this horrendous piece of crap. <br/><br/>Please people do yourself a favor, save your money and go and buy a comic book and experience the real Tintin. You won't regret it. <br/><br/>Rating: 1/10..."
"jacquescronje","2","50","82","28 December 2011"," Nothing like the books, what a disappointment.
","Spielberg ignored the story lines of the book completely and created a messed up hodgepodge of random events that made no sense. Why did Sakharine become the villain? He was an idiot ancillary character in the books, not related to Red Rackham. <br/><br/>No Bird brothers, no trip to go look for the treasure, no Calculus, no personality for Snowy.... <br/><br/>The whole thing brought back horrible memories from Kingdom of the Crystal Skulls. It just made no sense, Spielberg blew it.<br/><br/>For all Tintin fans, this will be a huge letdown, but for people looking for a standard 'dip your head into the trough' movie.....<br/><br/>Oh well, 2/10 for the CGI."

"richard-856-600640","4","35","56","12 December 2011"," What the hell was that?
","Went to see this last night. I had serious reservations, because of what I had heard about the film, and because frankly, the previews just didn't look right. But I had similar reservations about Avatar, and I ended up liking that one a lot. The technology: The opening sequence was a tribute to the original animated TV series, where Tintin seems to run pretty much everywhere, but seemed disjointed and odd. When the photo-real action began, it didn't get any better for me. Tintin looked greasy, and his eyes were like glass balls in his head. None of the characters seemed to be able to walk normally. I got the impression they were all weightless, sort of like the characters in Shrek. This is odd to me because mocap should capture an actor's weight as he moves around, but this didn't make it into the film. There is one scene early on when a character runs into a light post, that makes it look like the light post had a force field around it. Other scenes, where Tintin is running and jumping, or when Haddock stumbles and falls, and particularly everything Milou does... just don't look right. I've seen other mocap films where the characters moved very realistically - Monster House, Avatar, even Final Fantasy. So why do they not look right in this movie? Maybe I'm too hard to please. The 3D was nice, however: never jarring, rarely gimmicky. I got a nice feeling of depth without the forced look that post-produced 3-D movies get.<br/><br/>The story: There are some spoilers here, but quite frankly, if you haven't read the books, it won't make any difference to you; if you have read the books, you might as well read on, so you won't end up sitting there for 100 minutes waiting for Tintin to go off on a trip to recover the sunken treasure. I grew up reading Tintin in French. I know all of the Tintin stories. Le Secret de la Licorne / Trésor de Rakham Le Rouge was one of the best. Some people who also have read Tintin say that it was good for the producers to throw in the Capitaine Haddock meeting Tintin story from another Tintin adventure - why? That took up about half the film, and caused the producers to throw out pretty much all of the second book - yes, they totally deleted the entire expedition to the tropics, the underwater adventures, meeting Professeur Tournesol, and put in scenes that were probably deleted from the last Indiana Jones film. There were some laughs, and from time to time, I saw past the dead eyes and clumsy movements of the characters, but overall, it just didn't work for me. Some of the minor details also left me cold. At one point, Tintin pulls a gun out, and it's not a Browning Hi-Power. It looked like a Walther PPK, or some other smaller handgun. I can't be sure, but I fondly remember Tintin ALWAYS using a Browning Hi-Power pistol. It's the Belgian pistol of choice, and Hergé was a proud Belgian. I could be wrong about this, so call me on it if I'm wrong.<br/><br/>The 1930s: it looked like a 1930's period piece. Interesting, because Tintin's early adventures were set in pre-war Europe, but it's going to be odd in the sequels when they try to make Objectif Lune, when Tintin goes to the moon.<br/><br/>Language: I saw this in French in the theater, and quite frankly, it was disappointing. Everything was in English. I was hoping for some sort of attempt to retain the core language of Tintin, including props, news clippings, street signs... it's all in English. I guess I was expecting the same sort of excellence you get in a Pixar film, where they take the time to change the title sequence, and some if not all of the text in the film to the language that it's dubbed in.<br/><br/>Chase Scenes: Spielberg can't seem to let this go. He inserts incredible chase scenes into his films. The scenes go on too long, and the characters perform stunts that are completely ridiculous, even in Tintin's world. The Morocco chase scene that everyone is talking about just went on and on and on, with weightless CG characters bouncing along like pin balls. One chase scene inexplicably had a tank appear, dragging a stucco building along with it. Not sure what that was about.<br/><br/>Overall: It was a crushing disappointment. It played like a Tintin- flavoured pulp action flick set in the 1930s. So, should you go see this? I have two recommendations for you: 1) If you like Tintin, and hate it when producers make unnecessary changes to good stories when they make a movie, don't pay money to see this in the theater. 2) If you thought the last Indiana Jones film was good, run! don't walk to the theater to see this. I swear, the only missing was the nuclear bomb/fridge stunt."
"Redcitykev","Null","19","28","16 November 2011"," Visually Interesting but...
","First up I have to admit that as a kid I was never a big fan of Tintin - he was always that strange kid in a comic book from some other place! - so, with no great expectations regarding this film, I approached it with an open mind.<br/><br/>What I discovered was a film that, although visually very interesting, seemed confused and muddled. First off Tintin is, as I understand it, a Belgian boy reporter, so why were all the characters in the early market scene talking in mock cockney al-la Dick Van Dyke and doing deals in pound stirling and why were all the big houses seemingly a mix of North European Chateaux and English Country Houses? Next the story line starts off with an interesting premise - a mystery hidden within a model ship - but soon descends into a flimsy excuse for dashing from one big set piece to another - including a totally bewildering sequence in Morroco with tanks and bazookas etc (were these left over from the war, or is the story line set during WWII? If the later then where were the Nazis? etc), and by the time any real conclusion is reached I felt so exhausted by all the chases, explosions, pirates, opera singers who can shatter glass (like I didn't see that one coming from a mile away!) etc I no longer really cared! And of course there was the now obligatory open end allowing for the inevitable follow up! What so disappointed me about the film was the fact that this came from Spielberg, a past master at such fast paced adventure films. It seemed that he was not certain himself as to which film he was making - an animated version of a world-wide classic series of books or an animated version of Indianna Jones? There were odd little clues littering the film (a tail of a crashed plane in the dessert with a swastika on it, the aforementioned tanks etc) that seemed to suggest the later but the whole enterprise became so muddled that I guess in the end it didn't really matter.<br/><br/>Finally, for all the marvels of the animation this was, for me, a film without soul. The character of Tintin was just a cipher (as I believe he is in the books), Haddock was just a buffoon, the Thompson Twins plan silly and the other characters utterly forgettable! The only character I came away really like was Snowy the dog! For all the hype this is basically, like this years version of The Three Musketeers, a film that may keep the youngster quiet for a couple of hours, but one that made me feel like ""ok, watchable but so what""!"

The 3D in this film is spectacular and it's well worth seeing this film in 3D if you can.

"GirishGowda","8","34","59","13 November 2011"," Billions of blue blistering barnacles! Tintin and Haddock make a spectacular debut!
","I still clearly remember the first time I was introduced to Tintin's world. It was the winter of 1997 and I was just an 8-year-old kid who had come home from the hospital after a freak accident. I was supposed to stay in bed for a month. The next day after coming home from work, my mom brought me ""The Black Island"". I instantly fell in love with the artwork, the soulful story, the endearing nuanced characters and exciting adventures of Tintin. I quite admired Tintin and during the course of the month I devoured all the books in the series. I kept re-reading them till I was 14 or thereabouts and every time I delved into the world of Tintin, it was like an epic adventure. Frankly it didn't matter that I knew what the story was or how it ended. That was the power of Herge's masterful storytelling. Subsequently, I also loved the 1991 TV series which was extremely faithful to the narrative of the books. So, as you can well imagine, I was very excited when I heard that one of the best and one of my most favorite directors, Spielberg was directing its big screen adaptation. <br/><br/>Herge was a fan of Spielberg's early works and had written in a note that - ""If anyone can bring Tintin successfully to the screen, it is this young American film director, Steven Spielberg"". Almost three decades after Herge's death, his wish has finally been fulfilled. ""The Adventures of Tintin"", the first big screen adaptation of the world-renowned and beloved classic comic books of the same name has been released all over the world. The animated world of Tintin is amazing to look at; every little scene has been done in great detail and care. This isn't Pixar CG animation, nor Disney's hand-drawn animation. Herge's world is created wonderfully using WETA digital by motion capture technology. The sense of wonder never ceases to exist in this world and the human emotions on the animated characters have never been richer. We can sense Spielberg's love and admiration for the original source material through the almost noir atmosphere of the film and the effort put into the characters to make them as interesting as they are in the books.<br/><br/>PLOT: Our young, well-known reporter Tintin buys a regal model of a three-masted sailing ship, 17th century ""The Unicorn"", for a good price. But he is then immediately accosted by the sinister Ivanovitch Sakharine and the mysterious figure of Barnaby, who both try to buy the model from Tintin, without success. Tintin does his research on the ship and discovers that Sir Francis Haddock was the sole survivor and captain of the ill-fated ship. Sir Francis' last words were that only a true Haddock would figure out what happened on that last voyage of The Unicorn. He returns home to find his model of the Unicorn stolen. When he breaks into Sakharine's mansion, he uncovers the truth about the existence of other Unicorn models. Along his journey to uncover the truth, he is kidnapped by smugglers. While trying to escape, he teams up with the drunkard, Captain Haddock of the Karabudjan and thus begins the epic adventure of Tintin. <br/><br/>The movie is a combination of three books - ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", ""Red Rackham's Treasure"". The desert scene is taken from ""The Land of Black Gold"". While the narrative of the stories remain somewhat the same, the creative liberties taken somehow takes away the essence of what makes the character of Tintin - ""TINTIN"". I didn't admire him, like I admire the comic character. Due the fact that this movie is being released in 2011 and aimed for a completely new generation of kids and adults who may have never even touched one of Herge's masterpieces, the writers have gone for the quick paced roller-coaster ride form of storytelling. But Spielberg knows that at the center of every great movie, the hearts of the audience must empathize with the characters. He makes one of the most memorable, lovable, animated characters in history with Captain Haddock. Haddock shines over Tintin and it is to be expected since all the three books which were adapted were telling the story of Haddock's ancestors and his origins. While I did enjoy the movie, it was very jarring to see Tintin chasing after the falcon in such an unrealistic way. Herge's Tintin, while being intelligent, courageous and caring, never would have done what Spielberg's Tintin did in that particular sequence. I am not being a purist and blasting it apart. On the contrary, I got over it soon enough and even enjoyed it. Also, its quite refreshing to see that even though it is PG movie, it still showed drunkards, murders and Haddock's swearing. Interpol agents Thompson and Thomson have a small part in the movie and they are hilarious. I was glad they didn't overuse the incompetent, blundering idiots. That made them all the more likable.<br/><br/>The movie ended with the possibility of a sequel. I hear Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings) will be bringing ""Tintin and Prisoners of the Sun"" to the big-screen next. I hope to see many more Tintin movies if it has its heart in the right place like this one did. Die-hard fans of Tintin may not find the movie to be as emotionally engaging as the books, but its an excellent endeavour nonetheless. This is the one of best action-adventure movies of the year. Master filmmaker Spielberg's first foray into into the world of animation and motion capture, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a spectacle to behold and cherish. It may even be nominated for Best Animated Picture next year. Take your kids, friends, family and have a jolly good time at the movies. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Guaranteed to bring you to arousal, if you're sexually attracted to crap, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is an animated adventure by director Steven Spielberg. The film was based on a series of graphic novels by cartoonist Georges Remi.<br/><br/>Remi's strip-cartoons revolved around Tintin and Snowy, a young adventurer and his trusty canine. Billed as ""movies on paper"", they offered complex (for their time) plots, an impeccable sense of pace and were renowned for their ""ligne claire"" style, which utilised uncluttered panels, no hatching and bold, clean imagery. This style would go on to influence everyone from Warhol to Lichtenstein to Chris Ware.<br/><br/>In almost every respect, Spielberg's ""Tintin"" is the opposite of Remi's. Whereas Remi's aesthetic is minimalist, Spielberg's is one of excess. He opens with an over-long title sequence, for example, and uses a roving, constantly moving camera which simply can't compete with the elegant, locked down compositions of Remi. And where Remi's characters and landscapes were beautifully abstract, Spielberg has opted for a wholly awful aesthetic, with photo-realistic locales and creepy, pseudo-realistic characters. It's uncanny valley hell, especially if you're familiar with the real-life actors upon which Spielberg's heroes and villains are derived.<br/><br/>Epitomizing Spielberg's obsession with excess is the motion capture technology used to animate ""Tintin's"" characters. Such technology allows computer models to replicate even the minutest of expressions as they occur in real-time on live actors. But every cartoonist knows that less is often more. Remi conveyed more with a simple black dot than Spielberg's army of microprocessors and virtual muscles. Like ""Avatar"", Spielberg's ""Tintin"" is art for technology fetishists. Those who fall for the latest product roll-outs and believe that technological objects are empowered by dint of their intrinsic properties.<br/><br/>""Tintin"" takes 24 slow minutes to get to its first action sequence. Here a realistic looking dog in a realistic looking town does cartoonish, unrealistic looking things. It's a tasteless juxtaposition. Compare to Disney's action-pups in ""Bolt"". Compare too to Yuri Norshteyn's many primitively designed, yet wonderfully animated animals.<br/><br/>""Tintin"" then enters its best segment, our heroes battling villains on an old cargo ship (taken from Remi's ""The Crab with the Golden Claws""). From here we progress to a desert town, where Spielberg attempts to dazzle us with an elaborate long take in which Tintin bumbles from mountaintop to coastline. Like all the exposition and action in the feature, this sequence is dull, and pales in comparison to Zemeckis' many recent, similarly conceived sequences (""Beowulf""). Also included are a battle on a pirate ship and a climactic fight in which dockyard cranes spar. The latter sequence is dull, the former shows us two things we've never seen before: ships firing their cannons at one another through the crests of waves, and ships entangled at their masts, swinging wildly like oceanic pendulums.<br/><br/>Old fashioned (they're based on stories almost a century old), ""Tintin's"" plot needed severe updating for savvy audiences raised on modern animated films. Likely to appeal to those unfamiliar with animated features, Spielberg's tale is predictable, slow, never surprises, and his audience is always ten steps ahead. Worse still, Tintin's an annoying character (why British and Scottish accents?), soulless in the eyes, built by morticians and devoid of personality. Tom McCarthy, Tintinologist and author of ""Tintin and the Secret of Literature"", would accuse Spielberg of not understanding Remi's creation. ""Gauche and anachronistic, Spielberg's adaptation is not just a failure,"" he'd say, ""but an assault on a great body of art so thuggishly moronic as to make one genuinely depressed"". ""Tintin"" made almost four hundred million world wide. Spielberg spent a little over 2 weeks doing hands-on direction.<br/><br/>3/10 – Better recent animated films outside of Pixar, DreamWorks, Disney and Miyazaki: Chomet's ""The Illusionist"", Lunak's ""Alois Nebel"", Hosoda's ""Summer Wars"" and ""The Girl Who Leapt Through Time"", Oshii's ""The Sky Crawlers"", ""From Up on Poppy Hill"", Satoshi Kon's ""Paprika"" and Yeon Sang-ho's ""The King of Pigs"", arguably the best animated feature of 2011. Worth one viewing."

","This isn't the worst movie ever made, but it certainly lacks... well, anything of value. It all just meanders around, always making you think that something is about to happen, but nothing ever does. In many ways it's very similar to Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but it feels twice as long and is even less entertaining. There's a terribly weak MacGuffin that sets everything into motion (or at least the appearance of motion), then a young man goes chasing after it for little reason other than curiosity, then he partners up with a salty older man whose key characteristic is that he's a hopeless drunkard (a simple switch of focus from older male lead to younger). Oh, and there's a terrible, hopelessly mean baddie... who does what villains do. There are several instances of Indiana Jones-like chase scenes and blah, blah, blah... It just gets bogged down in so much, ""been there, done that"" territory, all the while spinning and whipping you around during long, increasingly boring attempts at ""set pieces"" where the camera seems to never stop flipping and turning and careening in and out of bubbles or reflections in swords or puddles and drawing faaaaar too much attention to each transition between nearly every shot! So not only is there nothing going on, there is SO MUCH nothing going on that it's difficult not to throw your 3D glasses to the floor and stomp out only an hour into the whole mess... which is precisely what we did (well, it may have been an hour and 15 minutes into it). Oh, and the last straw was really the fact that the MacGuffin is simply sunken treasure... Give me a break! There MUST be more interesting things to search for in this world besides freaking sunken treasure!!! Sure, it may have turned out to be something a bit more interesting, but after an hour and however long, it was too painful to imagine sitting through another 30 or so minutes of the blandest bit of flashy mediocrity I've seen in ages."

","I am sorry for my English but I am french.<br/><br/>To me the movie is really bad in itself, even without thinking to the original comic.<br/><br/>But you can guess it's largely worse if you dare to compare it to the very clever and rich Hergé piece.<br/><br/>In fact there are several problem:<br/><br/>1- The story is empty, it has no link at all with the comic, they took three episodes, they mixed them and kept only the action scenes. They added other action scenes that are completely absurd and ridiculous.<br/><br/>To me the most idiot thing, its the fact they added an highlander touch with the bad guy and haddock which is completely anachronistic and silly. The crane fight reminds the worse of Michael Bay, thats a shame they ruined this way such a subtle and class stuff for a ""rain man"" audience.<br/><br/>Also the characters have no way a link with the original ones. Haddock don't fight at all, and don't act like Tarzan, thats absurd.<br/><br/>2- The directing and the edit are absolutely awful. We cant breath, all go too fast, the camera is always moving, the transition are supposed to be hype but it has no class at all. Thats shallow and hysterical.<br/><br/>3- The visuals are ugly, OK the sets are cool, but the problem is about the character who are really boring and unbearable.<br/><br/>4- The music has no personality, its sad to see such a great guy as John Williams doing something so impersonal.<br/><br/>Big disappointment made to please American audience, and sacrificing the original spirit of tintin.<br/><br/>Even the little Belgium cartoon made on tintin which has not been made with thousands millions of dollars in early 90's is better, cooler, funnier, and more smart:"

","When I found out I was to see Tintin, I thought I would see something that Spielberg wouldn't have been able to denature. Boy was I wrong. There are a few deviations from Herge's work that are interesting. Thus, as Rackham le Rouge becoming the ancestor of the guy looking to put his hands on the treasure. There are elements that I suspect have been lifted from Disney, which also work out (the fight between the two dock cranes which is almost identical to the fight between Donald and his uncle ""manning"" one excavator each). The rest is standard Spielberg stuff, and it takes over Herge's work. Chain reaction as the water rushes down from the palace to the coastline? One more meaningless chain reaction of events that litter Spielberg's movies. Where are Herge's jokes? Gone. Herge's logical presentation is sacrificed to Spielberg's not-sure-what (e.g. in the movie the coordinates of the treasure single the castle, but at the castle, then Tintin yells he knows where to go and find the treasure as the coordinates of the treasure point to a specific place!!!!)."

","I knew Tintin from childhood cartoons so I was excited to see the movie version. I was sadly disappointed with this film and I hope Spielberg won't make another. The only reason I gave this film a 4/10 was for the animation. That being said, the computer generated characters were probably great to some but to me they seemed creepy. I story was corny and telegraphed itself to all but the feeble of mind. I wish they had updated the story a little. I also forgot how annoying the two comic relief characters could be. This movie's story was so bad that any small child would be bored to death. Too bad, Tintin had potential but I hope this is the end."
"Lagomorph01","4","31","60","28 October 2011"," Visually stunning, story wise boring.
","When going to film school, there was one mistake that I saw a lot of the beginning directors, cameramen, editors and the like make. They were all so focused on the technique behind the film, that they forgot to focus on story and the characters. Watching Tintin and the Secret of the Unicorn made me feel like I was in film school again.<br/><br/>From the first shot on, walking into the world of Tintin feels amazing, you see that everything was treated with the greatest care and eye for detail, and even though they still can't quite seem to get eyes right, the whole movie looks absolutely amazing. Strangely enough, you don't get the time to enjoy the beauty of it all, because right after the initial scene you're taken into a roller-coaster ride. It's there where this movie is starting to show it's flaws. There's very little breathing time left for the movie, and because of this, you never really get to feel or care for the characters. They never become lovable, they don't get their moment to shine and they're never genuinely funny.<br/><br/>Watching the whole spectacle, one begins to wonder if Spielberg purposely chose to abandon all basic storytelling rules and just go with it, or if he was distracted the whole technique of motion capture while making it. At least, to me, it feels that way.<br/><br/>As a result of this, the movie falls a bit flat. You have a great introduction sequence, but after this you're sucked into one two hour action sequence which is barely followable because of all the different layers of action going on on screen. Steady camera shots have been replaced by a constantly moving roller-coaster cam, which gives beautiful lenghty shots, but gives so much information that it's barely followable en sometimes even stomach turning.<br/><br/>Another part where the technique doesn't compliment in the storytelling is with the sometimes slapstick humor. Because the characters look so real, except for some facial features, as a viewer, you can't really accept some of the things that happen to them. If a piano falls on a cartoon character, you think it's funny because you accept that he'll just come out of it unharmed except for the fact that the piano keys are (completely playable) sticking out of his mouth. If that same thing happens to a human, we know that he would have broken every bone in his body and, if still alive, would have to be driven to the intensive care immediately. These kind of things feel illogical in the movie and take the viewer away from the viewing experience.<br/><br/>Storywise they took the easy way out. The situations feel forced and uneasy, like they wanted to put as many locations in the film as they could, and the plot, told by action instead of dialogue, is rather laughable. I don't like to compare the source material to the movie in a review, but the way they translated and hollywoodised the story feels out of place and never genuine. This feeling even goes as far as the soundtrack, because even the music by the brilliant John Williams seems flat, uninspired and never truly memorable. We never hear any of the compositions that Williams excels at, the recognizable orchestrated themes introducing plot elements or characters, telling a story of their own. But to be honest, these elements never really get enough screen time to have their own theme.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it feels like the movie was focused on technique, and while it looks truly beautiful, it lacks in all the other departments. And in a world in which computer graphics get prettier every day, this movie, in a couple of years, will be forgotten with the rest of the for-their-time beautiful, but lacking story wise, computer animated films."
"TheHighVoltageMessiah","8","9","14","21 December 2011"," Much Better Than Expected
","I'm an American Tintin fan – yes, believe it or not, they do exist – and when I first heard that Steven Spielberg was at the helm of a three-dimensional rendering of Tintin, Haddock, Snowy, and their world, I became somewhat worried. First of all, the creations of Hergé seemed so fitting for traditional animation. Transforming the characters and putting human eyeballs in the circles of Tintin's eyes felt wrong. On top of that, I was afraid (particularly after the trailers came out) that the film would just be a vapid wild ride that failed to do justice to the well-loved comics.<br/><br/>But, now that I've seen it, I confess I liked it much more than I thought I would. It isn't perfect, but it's spirited and fun – and mostly in keeping with the original comic books. The opening credits introduce Tintin and Snowy in silhouette and give watchers a taste of the boy reporter's adventures. After that, the film switches to motion capture. I was surprised at how well this worked. It felt for the most part like the same environment evoked by Herge, only morphed seamlessly into three dimensions.<br/><br/>The story is a lively and rip-roaring yarn full of charm and humor. It follows Tintin as he teams up with Captain Haddock to discover the lost treasure of the captain's ancestor, while staying one step ahead of the icily devilish Mr. Sakharine. Episodes from ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" are interspersed with the general plot of ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", but everything comes together fairly smoothly. The film is mostly true to the essence of its source material, even if it is not entirely faithful to the letter. I, for one, was overjoyed to see the old sea dog, Haddock, so endearingly drunk. (Andy Serkis stole every scene he was in.) I was glad to see Tintin so adventuresome. The Thompsons were a riot in their slapstick clumsiness. And it was a delight to see various Tintin side characters pop up – like Alan, Nestor, and most especially, the beautifully shrill-voiced Bianca Castafiore.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, there *were* certain action sequences that were overly excessive. The chase in Morocco careens this way and that so crazily that it soon becomes inane. Characters tumble and plunge and things wheel and whirl about in a way that strains credulity. By becoming so overblown, it kills suspense. How can the audience be exhilarated in a section of the film where the most madcap occurrences go on – and characters suffer little to no injury? It jars viewers out of the spell worked elsewhere in the movie. If such scenes were toned down and given some semblance of reality along with being exciting, they would have worked better, in my opinion.<br/><br/>(Also, the filmmakers add a plot twist involving the ancestry of the antagonist that I find tacky and unnecessary. Plus, in my eyes, it was poorly handled and turned out as a rather awkward revelation. See the film to fully understand my meaning.) <br/><br/>All in all, though, I'd recommend Spielberg's ""The Adventures of Tintin"". If you're a fan, you may have a bone to pick here and there, but should still enjoy it. If you are unfamiliar with Tintin, you ought to be pulled in anyway by his entertaining escapades – and I hope your introduction to him encourages you to seek out Hergé's original works."
"Andy-296","5","13","22","25 December 2011"," Disappointing
","A huge disappointment by two genuinely great directors specialized in popular entertainment, like Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. The secret of The Unicorn was the first Tintin book I read (my parents give it to me as a present when I was 9 years old, more than thirty years ago). It is also one of my favorite Tintin books. This might be why I felt so disappointed by this. Absent from the movie is all the subtlety in the book. What is present here is a very heavy handed, video-game like approach.<br/><br/>In theory, this could have been a match made in heaven, as previous works by Spielberg especially (like the Indiana Jones franchise) have a strong resemblance to Tintin, in terms of plot and in terms of the epoch (the thirties and the forties were the epoch were both Tintin and Indiana have their best outings). In practice, the film doesn't work. Let's try to analyze why.<br/><br/>Let's first concede that Tintin is difficult to bring into the screen (previous adaptations, both animated and live-action, have failed). I think one of the reasons is that Tintin lives in a very stylized world, and this becomes quite obvious when one transplants Tintin from a drawing in a paper to a photographic medium (even in the form of computer animation).<br/><br/>The charming plot of the book (Tintin finds by accident a manuscript hidden inside a model ship called the Unicorn that might be a clue to a hidden treasure, and soon sees himself chased by other people interested in that treasure), has some minor changes, but those changes are generally for the worst. For instance, the slimy Bird brothers in the book were better villains than Ivan Sakharine in the film, who was not one of the bad guys in the original book. Mixed up with the plot of the Unicorn (and in a not very convincing manner), appear elements of other Tintin books, especially The Crab with the Golden Claws, another favorite of mine.<br/><br/>Lastly, the animation is not completely convincing: the problem of the unrealistic eyes (the so called uncanny valley, which many have pointed already in The Polar Express, and which evidently hasn't been solved) makes for a Tintin that is slightly creepy. By the way, the photography is some scenes is too dark and murky, when the Tintin books are famous for the use of bright colors and little contrast (the famous clear line style)."
"TourettesPersonal","8","13","22","3 December 2011"," Recapturing The Excitement
","The Adventures of Tintin is a movie made by the most brilliant filmmakers of Hollywood and there is no doubt that this movie will be good. They got Steven Spielberg directing, Peter Jackson producing, Edgar Wright co-writing, and some great actors. The execution, it's a load of big fun. Steven Spielberg recreates his classic trademark action sequence. The performances were excellent. The animation is uncanny valley but it's done well though. The film may have its dragging moments but throughout it's undeniably enjoyable.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the performances. Jamie Bell really brings Tintin to life. Andy Serkis is always great at motion capture and he actually steals the show as Haddock. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are always a good pair. Even without their faces, they are still fun to watch. Daniel Craig gives a brilliantly fascinating performance. The motion capture helped their fancy movements. Even though it looks weird.<br/><br/>The film has Spielberg. After all of his alien movies, he returned to action adventures. He keeps it big and exciting. Every action scenes are ridiculously thrilling. The mystery works enough telling it. The weakest parts might be the over introduction of the characters. The opening credits already shows who Tintin is. The beginning of the story just stretched it a bit more longer. Haddock's introduction is also stretched. Maybe to make things clear but it's a little bit dragging. The rest of the film enjoyable.<br/><br/>The animation, like I say, is weird for the characters but it makes it easy for its action sequences. Visuals are incredibly spectacular and it obviously makes the whole adventure exciting. The score is fancy. When it comes to the action scenes, it gets adventurous. And the homage of the original Tintin is scattered. The cinematography fits to its animation. The camera is shaky in a different manner.<br/><br/>Fans of Spielberg and Hergé's Tintin comics will definitely love this movie for recapturing their classic homage. While the other moviegoers might find it fascinating. Yes, the movie's excitingly thrilling and undeniably enjoyable. Since this is just the beginning of a series, It's a perfect reintroduction of an iconic character. Although, it lingers too much. I hope it gets more bigger in the sequels. Again, it's big, exciting, hilarious and really enjoyable."

","I'd never expect a Blockbuster movie to be worth of paying any attention beyond entertainment, but this one was even below my expectations for what one would call ""entertaining"". And of course it was not even close to what Herge had created. With tons of computers, 3D technology and over $100 million, Spielberg failed to achieve what Herge simply did with a pen and paper. As a great Tintin fan, I now feel terribly offended (both for what I just watched and for the fact that Spielberg also calls himself a fan) and as a passionate film goer, I just feel sorry for how art is the last thing that's noticed in mainstream American cinema.<br/><br/>I Borrowed Spielberg's (yes, it's not Herge's) Tintin from Netflix (I insisted not to pay for it, because of all bad things I'd heard about it) and watched it out of curiosity (just curiosity - to see why other Tintin fans didn't like it), and found it even below my expectations. Everything is terribly superficial here, as the original story and characters have been destroyed and turned into some lame boring and dull Hollywood crap. In a word, the original work's spirit is completely lost here: Tintin is about mystery, reality (I stress on this: Tintin is one of the few comic book characters that feels real) and humanity, but Spielberg's interpretation is all about some stupid and unreal action and some annoying 3D techniques, plus, a camera that moves and moves and rotates around the characters over and over! I had a feeling that I'm in a thrill ride, and wanted to puke couple of times. It's interesting that Herge's hand-drawn characters look more real than Spielberg's superficial CGI characters. And if those camera moves and actions don't excite you, there's really nothing beyond, as characters, events and story are all superficial and about action. No wonder why in couple of months, no one talks about the movie anymore, while Herge's work is still fresh after decades.<br/><br/>Score: 1/10"

","The animation in Tin Tin is exceptional. Very impressive; however, that does not a movie make. My uncle is a really, really snappy dresser but one of the most boring public speakers that I've ever heard even though he looks good. The same thing applies here. There is very little plot and almost no dialogue. The whole movie is a chase scene. Did you see Casino Royale? It opened with that fantastic chase scene between Bond and the Haitian? It was riveting! They were up and down construction equipment, flying through and over walls, it was breathtaking. Tin Tin is that scene for a whole movie and while that might seem like a compliment, it is not. Twenty minutes into the movie you find yourself saying, ""Enough already...okay...I get it..."" It got very old, very quickly. I found my mind wandering and looking at the animation of the ocean and the boats and other things that were well done. Boring, boring, boring. Kids will probably like it but that doesn't make it a good movie. Go watch a Pixar movie again."

","I went into Tintin with great expectations, I intentionally ignored any trailers or reviews as I wanted to go into the film without any prejudice, unfortunately the film did not live up to my expectations, worse than that, I found it to be an utter bore.<br/><br/>First though, the positives. The film is visually spectacular, it's vibrant, detailed and just a joy to behold. The characters are designed wonderfully, almost like they were ripped out of the series and placed into a 3-dimensional world. The 3D, if you decide or are forced to watch it in the format, is great for the most part. There are some shots that stood out as looking spectacular in 3D, in particular a long corridor shot on the ship really impressed me.<br/><br/>The direction is also great, throughout the many set-pieces in the film, Spielberg's hand guides us through these scenes with flair, and you can tell he's taken advantage of the format with some wonderfully creative shots.<br/><br/>On to the negative, and in my opinion they outweigh the positive.<br/><br/>The film feels jumbled and at times I felt like I was dragged kicking and screaming into the next bombastic and usually unnecessary set-piece. There were so many chases, escapes and battles there was never going to be time for character development, let alone a story that could be told well. Let's not forget that this film will be an introduction to Tintin for many people, and action fans will lap it up. More discerning film- goers with a desire for something a little more substantial will leave disappointed.<br/><br/>To me, one of the most important parts of the series is the relationship between Haddock and Tintin, and it is not well developed in the film, a real missed opportunity in my opinion. The film really dragged, which was a huge disappointment for me. I was relieved once it was over, but I hope it makes enough moolah for a superior sequel to be made."

","A MUST SEE movie!!<br/><br/>Saw it in 3D with original English speech. Wow what a movie. Putting ion my professional glasses as a 3D illustrator - the 3D was simply stunning! <br/><br/>All details were done to perfection, materials were literally photo-real. All was modeled, - no shortcuts, such as facades added just a texture. The animations - done mostely by motion tracking - were 100% natural, mimics as well, - even tongue movements at closeups were done - and they looked real! Amazing!<br/><br/>All characters in the movie are modeled so they are photo-real and at the same time stay true to the Hergé world. So you can say that it is made as cartoon characters with a photo-real look. That fact that they are not completely human-like is actually liberating for your mind, - because you switch of your brains automatic dissecting scanning of how a human look like - which still often start some alerts ""This is not a real human"" (amazing what our brains can do in a split of a second). Thereby you see the characters as figures and your are not disturbed by the many ""no human"" alerts, that often appear when you see other 3D animation movies.<br/><br/>I have put the weight in this review on the technical aspects of the movie - because this is what I am best at, - and there are many others that can make a better review of the plot etc. My impression however is, that movie has all elements a movie of that kind needs, - excitement, - humor, - action - and you never know what is waiting around the corner, - even though you have read ""the book"" - the mix of the 2-3 books is done with such caution and artistic ingenuity. And as all good movies it stop just when you have taken the jump from a cliff - and just can't wait to see what will happen then ...

When a story of this extraordinary caliber is handed to you on a silver platter and all you have to do is translate it onto the big screen, how is it even possible to fail this tremendously?

"addiewhiz","8","4","5","30 December 2011"," Satisfies, Gets the Job Done
","I got the opportunity to see ""Tintin"" just yesterday, and my bottom line is that it's definitely worth seeing and delivers just about what I had expected out of a ""Tintin"" film.<br/><br/>I was in anticipation of this film upon the announcement that there would be a ""Tintin"" movie and that it was going to be made by Stephen Spielberg and Peter Jackson, but other than that, I was not expecting much. I also had some familiarity with the ""Tintin"" because I used to read the comic when I was younger.<br/><br/>It appears as though, for this film, Spielberg has taken a page out of his own ""Indiana Jones"" films, as many of the scenes in this film entail high speed chases, adrenaline filled acrobatics, and daring shootouts. This of course, is fitting because the Tintin comic contains many such sequences.<br/><br/>The film delivered in the sense that it stayed largely true to the comic book series on which it is based. Many of the characters looked exactly as I had imagined their 3D version would look in the movies, and as far as the artistry goes, I think the author of the series, Hergé, would approve. In addition, Spielberg manages to use 3D as much more than a simple gimmick in this film, as it helps many of the characters come alive, especially towards the end of the film, where Tintin, the title character is riding through the streets of Baggar in the climactic action sequence.<br/><br/>The nature and antics of the characters also stayed largely true to their comic book origins. This is especially true for Thomson and Thompson, who were just as I had imagined an animated version of them would be.<br/><br/>However, it addition to my praise, I do have some points of criticism. The first point, I had expected and thus it did not bother me as much as it would have had I not read the original comic book series. ""Tintin"" is essentially the story of a series of static characters that have fantastic things happen to them. None of these events or happenings have any effect on the characters personality, beliefs or point of view and each of the characters finishes, by the end of the story, at the same place they began. Tintin will always be a courageous reporter with a large traveling budget, and the villain (in this case, Sakharine) goes through no change of his own, or at least we are not shown any change in his character after he loses to Tintin.<br/><br/>My other complaint is a relatively small one, but it did begin to bother a little bit as the film wore on. There is a certain transition effect that Spielberg uses, at first innovatively, but then repetitively. At one point in the film, we are looking at a lifeboat on a calm sea, and then, objects start to form in the sea around the lifeboat until the sea becomes a puddle on a street that someone steps in. At another point, Tintin and Captain Haddock shake hands and the bumps on their hands formed by the protrusion of the bones on their knuckles become sand dunes in the desert. Spielberg uses this type of transition several times in the film, and at first it appears to be rather creative. However, it feels a bit overused by the end of a film. It felt slightly like the first time I learned how to make presentations on Microsoft Powerpoint, and became extravagant with the way in which I used the animation functions. At first it's fun, but later it becomes a little annoying to watch.<br/><br/>So the bottom line is that this film is good, not great. I'm sure it met expectations that Tintin fans had, but it really doesn't go above and beyond that. In the end, I would say that this movie is worth watching once."

So when I heard about the film announcement back in 2009 you could imagine my reaction. However as the release date for the film grew ever closer and new news was being released about it like the mo-cap format, I was slowly becoming more and more disinterested. Until last weekend when I was actually dreading going to my local cinema to watch it. I'd heard mixed reviews about it from friends and family. But never the less I went into the film with an open mind. About 2 hours later I came out with a literal headache, views of the film were spinning round my head, so I thought I'd tell you my review of tintin: the secret of the unicorn.<br/><br/>For me this film was hard to watch for a variety of reasons. Reason number 1- Their wasn't 5 minutes in this film that didn't go without action, it was just ridiculous, half the action in the film never even happens in the book. My problem is that with kids films these days, they have way too much action and too many silly scenes, its like the directors of these films think that children are so uneducated that they can't even follow a simple storyline. This is all too true in Tintin, I may be exaggerating a tad , but I would go as far as saying it was quite insulting to the intelligences of kids around the UK. Children CAN follow simple stories and they don't need big explosions every minute to keep them stimulated.<br/><br/>Reason 2- Back in 2010 I saw an interview with Steven Spielberg, their he was asked ' is the film true to the books' and he replied yes. It isn't. The whole focus point for Tintin and the thing that makes it great is the sense of adventure in the story. However in the film they hardly stick to the story of the book, so they pretty much devised their own story. This for me just made the film feel like any other cartoon film, because the classic story wasn't their to make it stick all together. For example the secret of the unicorn is part one of two books however at the end of the film they do all of part 1 then just skip the whole of the 2nd book. Although, it wasn't just the story that frustrated me it was also the characters. In the books Tintin is an innocent young reporter who cares about others that's why I was annoyed to find out that in the film he's quite angry and trigger happy! Also his friend captain haddock is made out to be a maniac to literally can't behave properly without alcohol whereas in the books he's civilised and lovable.<br/><br/>Reason 3- My 3rd and final reason is that I had the unfortunate experience of seeing this film in 3-D. Yet again the 3-d in this film was completely unnecessary, their wasn't one moment which was made for 3-D. Yet again I found myself enjoying the 3-D adverts more than the 3-D film and yet again found myself watching the majority of the film without the glasses. 3-D is just a gimmick for all these big 'movie' studios to rake in as much money as possible and frankly conning movie goers! Films shouldn't be in 3-D unless they were made for it!<br/><br/>As you most likely know Herge said if anyone was to make a film of tintin he wasn't want Spielberg to do it. Frankly for me he didn't do the job. That is why I think that it will be very interesting in a few years when the 2nd film is released with peter Jackson instead directing."
"premium90","1","33","68","19 November 2011"," Absolutely terrible. Nearly fell asleep.
","I'm not going to mention too much about this film due to being so disappointed with this film. Like many, I grew up reading the comic books as a child and then later in my teenage years the cartoon. What can you say about this film. Positive points is that the graphics are far superior than ever before. It really looks real life and the expression of each character is brilliant. Straight away you know that it is tin tin, pardon the orange tinge to his hair. I am very sure he was kind of blonde right? Anyway.... we decided to watch the 3D version. Oh yeah. 3D....... <br/><br/>Back to it. Positive points only is the fantastic graphical presentation throughout the film. I can not fault it one bit.<br/><br/>Now, the bad thing. The whole film. I nearly fell asleep. Roughly at 30 minutes, I had to move around to keep myself awake! Oh no. I had another 1hr 10 minutes of this film to go through. I am not being funny! 1hr 10 minutes. My head was telling me, another 30 minutes the film will pick up. Yes..... actually no.<br/><br/>1hr 40 minutes later, I felt I was robbed of my life. I'm not joking. I thought it was the worse film this year. I am not kidding.<br/><br/>Now for the 3D. 3D... another gimmick and another big con. I'm sorry but if this film was not considered to be 3d, leave it as it is. Why oh why! The trailer looked 3d but this film surely not so. If I was you and you are desperate to watch the film, stick the digital 2d version.<br/><br/>All in all, the one point is for the amazing attempt of the graphical presentation of the film. Pity about the film. I will not be watching the sequel."
"IonicBadger","4","22","43","28 October 2011"," Great productions values but the story had me irritated more than once
","I have been a tintin fan since I was six years old but this movie destroyed the story elements completely.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg decided to mix and match two different stories into one and for someone who has not seen any Tintin it might work well.<br/><br/>But for me who have seen the animated series and read the comics I was furious.<br/><br/>So much was changed storywise and I could not understand why and way to much slapstick humor that just hurt to watch, some funny elements but mostly it felt forced.<br/><br/>But despite this I have to say the production value was great fantastic animation, that is going to have pixar feeling more than a little shaken.<br/><br/>I just wished they stayed true to Herge's story"
"allotati","1","25","50","23 March 2012"," All Over the Place
","This is a scatterbrained nightmare. How disappointing to see such a great idea become spoiled with a plot rushing so quickly and ill character development. When are the great directors and movie makers going to get the fact that the movie scenes need to STOP MOVING AROUND ALL OVER THE PLACE MAKING ONE FEEL LIKE THEY HAVE CAR SICKNESS. YOU KEEP DOING THIS WITH ALL THE FREAKEN FILMS!! <br/><br/>The animation is brilliant, but the editing, the development of the story was ruined with the rushed pace and all the action scenes. There was no time to make a connection with the characters. Dear movie makers do you really think we are that short sighted? What happened to the more sophisticated films? How could Spielberg make this kind of film, along with the latest Indiana Jones film? <br/><br/>It became unwatchable, like Hugo. Dear movie makers, ""What is wrong with your insight?"" Such a sad indication of where this country is headed. A movie targeted to a different generation who need action films with constant movement in order to feel entertained. There is more to life than that. Whatever happened to peace and quality of the moment in films. There is more to animated films than ONLY FREAKEN ACTION!! Stop wasting time and money and make some GOOD films for a change that are engaging. Even the music by John Williams could not keep us connected to the film! What does that say!<br/><br/>What's up with the characters having humongous noses? It was so annoying to constantly see that."
"moorthyvlr","6","12","21","16 November 2011"," Did not reach my expectation
","I went to see this movie expecting to see the unveiling of Tintin in 3d. The visuals were fantastic. Still a lot of effort is needed to get the attention to explore the world of Tintin.<br/><br/>Tintin is a very popular comics. They have also made animation series and few movies. In the 3d era the expectations are always high.<br/><br/>The messed up part is the blending of other stories in the singular plot. There were some innovations but messing up with villain character is not wise.<br/><br/>The story would have gone well if concentration was given to the basic plot and its corresponding story and made improvisation on the details.<br/><br/>That would have been my expectation."
"Adhogati","7","17","32","11 November 2011"," An Absolute Romp for Tintin Fans!
","I would have given this movie an 8, but that would have been a disservice in general. While those who have read and loved Tintin would immensely enjoy every frame of the movie, those who are being introduced to the Character the first time around are likely to miss a few things here and there.<br/><br/>Yes, Tintin is brilliantly swashbuckling, and Haddock amazingly entertaining, but the story seems a trifle hurried while the pacing in some sequences in patchy.<br/><br/>What deserves a 10 on 10 however is the way Red Rackham's tale is woven into the story and how it was so evocatively presented, along with reference to a few characters which paved the path for any sequels that would be forthcoming.<br/><br/>Top marks to Spielberg an Jackson for sticking to the books even while weaving an original story line! Must Watch!"
"PipAndSqueak","3","19","37","6 November 2011"," Colourless
","Herge-Tintin-Snowy-Captain Haddock-The Thompson Twins - these are all much loved icons from the French films I was introduced to in my youth. I then began consuming the comic book versions. Film first, comic book second. I really will be surprised if children that age now, being introduced to Tintin from this modern English speaking version, will quite get the romance and desire to read the comics. I hated this film for its 'flatness'. The John Williams music is particularly dull and rubs the shine off a number of the action scenes. The animation too is not convincing enough - I found the characters' eye direction is quite often wrong giving well drawn figures a wooden feel. It felt like all the speech was in a monotone - the impression maybe got through that appalling music. I really don't want to waste any more time seeing this again to confirm or deny my assertion. I was bored. I expect children will be bored too."
"GTDMAC","10","5","7","2 July 2012"," Spielberg has done it again!
","It took both Spielberg and Peter Jackson to put this film together and it shows. Two supreme storytellers who's combined efforts are better than the sum of the parts. How often does that happen? I've read tons of reviews of John Carter that talk about how good it is and how it got bad press from the start. John Carter didn't make 370+ million dollars worldwide! (I wish it did but it didn't.) Tintin did. Why? It gave the fans EXACTLY what they wanted. A magnificent adventure! And who better to give it than the two greatest adventure creators of the 21st Century! John Carter would have been MUCH better done as an animated adventure but they wanted to go live and look what happened. These days you need real buildup not just a ""who's on the list to be John Carter this year?"" kind of attitude. JC didn't have the buildup like Tintin or certainly not like the Avengers and so there was no momentum to carry into seeing the movie. With Tintin everyone was stunned BOTH directors were collaborating and it shows. It's a work of art in every sense of the word. From the magnificent vistas to the hair-raising action sequences this is the state of the art in adventure movies today. Of course, Andy Serkis, Cary Elwes, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Daniel Craig and Toby Jones wouldn't have it otherwise! and let's give credit to Jamie Bell for the most believable Tintin voice yet! Great job all! The only bad part of all this is that there are certainly Tintin characters the fans would have wanted in the movie but aren't present. Chief among them is Professor Calculus. My hope is this is the first of many Tintin adventures and the dowsing doctor will be appearing in the next film coming soon."
"ma-cortes","7","8","13","16 November 2011"," Exciting and overwhelming retelling based on Tintin stories by means of Motion-capture technology
","Charming and worthwhile adaptation about timeless and quintessential European comic book . First and entertaining ¨Motion-Capture¨ Tintin rendition with exciting adventures set mostly in Africa . Original plot inspired on the popular and famous comic books by the genius Herge . Since his creation in 1930 with ¨Tintin in the land of Soviets¨ the success has been unstoppable . Within the next 80 years Tintin became one of the most popular European comics of the 20-21th Century, due to its well-researched plots, appealing characters, humor, political thrillers, & real world settings. The tale is ordinary Tintin album , with adventure in exotic places, this time on desert of Sahara and an African town located in Morocco. For those of you not familiar with Tintin, let's just say that every Belgium kids and most European children under the age and grown-up have been excited by his comic book adventures for over half a century . The picture will appeal to the fans of the popular animated hero named Tintin and his faithful sidekicks as well as the comic-books nostalgics . Having bought a model ship , the Unicorn, for a lot of money at a market stall Tintin (Jamie Bell) is initially intrigued that the mysterious Mr. Sakharine (Daniel Craig) should be so eager to buy it from him, resorting to kill and kidnapping Tintin to join him along with his band as they travel to Morocco on an old cargo boat. But someone else is in search of the ship as Sakharine has bribed the crew to revolt against the ship's master, drunken Captain Haddock . Tintin and Captain Haddock set off on a treasure hunt for a sunken ship commanded by Haddock's ancestor . But Tintin, Snowy and Haddock getaway , arriving in Morocco at the court of a Sheikh , who also has got a model of the Unicorn . Haddock tells Tintin that over three hundred years earlier his ancestor Sir Francis Haddock was forced to scuttle the boat Unicorn when attacked by a piratical forebear of Sakharine .Tintin accompanied by his wonderful dog Snowy (or Milu) and Captain Haddock helped by the Inspectors Thompson and Thompson( Simon Pegg, Nick Frost) attempt to discover what is so desirable about their ancient and apparently worthless boat. After a while, the truth comes out and battling over-the-top bad guys .<br/><br/>This is a funny , thriller ,action-packed , adventure comic book adaptation with hilarious moments here and there . This ¨Tintin and the secret unicorn¨ is an enjoyable Hollywood production, a wonderful and straight forward approach to Herge's original source material being splendidly directed . It has Tintin and his inseparable friends captain Haddock , the botcher Inspectors Thompson taking on , as always, against stupid , ruthless enemies and mean international delinquents . It is given the full ¨Motion Capture¨ deluxe treatment in this superior Holiday film. The production values & acting are both excellent, with just enough attractive to appeal to the Tintin fanatics , and with great doses of action , case of the potentially thrilling elements . This Motion-capture action movie of the popular ""Tintin"" comic-book magazine brilliantly captures the outrageous adventures, tongue-in-cheek, satire, comedy , roller-coaster action taking the characters and some elements from original stories . A marvelous recounting of Tintin stories and Andy Serkis demonstrates once again his versatility on screen in this marvelous adventure . Special effects add an impressive touch , but it is Andy Serkis as captain Haddock who really steal the show , he manages to capture pure magic with his stunningly awesome portrayal of the grumpy drunken and it is definitely worth a look . It's fun and different approach to Tintin classic character with top notch effects by means of ¨Motion Capture¨ a technique developed by Robert Zemeckis in previous films as ¨Beowulf , Polar Express and Christmas Carol¨. A highly recommended film that nobody should miss it especially during holiday time . ¨Steven Spielberg's adventures of Tintin¨ still ranks as one of the best adaptations of the Tintin classic ever . This amusing movie is accompanied by lively musical score composed and conducted by the classic John Williams , Spielberg's usual . Full of humor , it's a funny entertaining for kids and grown-ups . Entertaining screenplay is partially based on the known comics by Herge such as ¨The secret of the unicorn¨,¨The treasure of Rackam the Red¨ and ¨the crab of the golden pincers¨ but originally written by Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish . Based on the unforgettable characters created by ""Hergé"" born under the name Georges Remi on May 22, 1907 in Brussels, Belgium. As a child, Herge had a gift for drawing but never had any formal training in the visual arts. He attended both school and the boy scouts during the World War 1 and post-World War 1 era. After he finished school Herge published his first ever cartoon: ""The Adventures of Totor"". 1929, Herge introduced a cartoon about a traveling Belgium reporter (Tintin) accompanied by his fox terrier (Snowy) traveling the Soviet Union. By 1930,Herge published the very first Tintin book: ""Tintin in the Land of the Soviets"". After that , followed a weekly magazine in 1946 . Later on , it's published successful comic books as ¨Cigarrettes of pharaoh, Treasure of Rackam the Red ,Tintin and the scepter of Ottokar¨. Tintin soon became Herge's ""ligne Claire"" (French for clear line) legacy. The later adventures of Tintin involved other locations of the world from China ¨The blue Lotus¨ all the way to America as ¨Tintin in America¨. After completing 23 books, Herge passed away on March 3, 1983, leaving ""Tintin & the Alpha-Art"" (The 24th book) unfinished . Later on ,Raymond Leblanc produced the following films: ¨Tintin in the lake of Sharks¨ and 1970 ¨Tintín in the temple of the sun¨. The picture will appeal to Tintin comic-books buffs. An agreeable , funny adaptation from a great comic book."
"hario-s","Null","14","26","19 November 2011"," Boring and mislead story
","It is flaws and boring movie for me as a big fan of Tintin. Though I know every Tintin's cartoon movies didn't show the exact lines as it is in the book, but this one is completely unbelievable. The most unacceptable thing is the antagonist Sakharine, where suppose to be Murray who's the one that fighting for the treasures. Sakharine known only one of the man who stole Tintin's model, and later his parchment also stolen by Murray. Not even Murray's name mentioned in this movie.<br/><br/>Combining three books into one might be interesting for people who doesn't familiar with Tintin. But combination of three books that split far from its originality, could make a mislead.<br/><br/>I put 4 out of 10 votes, because the quality of the 3D animations are incredibly great. Best 3D characters and represent real Tintin and friends as I've imagined."
"Watch_And_Learn","3","19","38","8 November 2011"," Seriously ?!
","Was it for real?<br/><br/>This ""movie"" is really bad. It is like an animated cartoon, but with hideous graphics/characters (Gollum was a good idea in LOTR but you can't seriously make a movie with full Gollum style...well Tintin made it) and no fun (if you laugh for nothing you might find haddock funny though), so I really wonder what's the point. <br/><br/>There isn't nostalgia neither, the Tintin cartoons made in the 90's are far better than this movie, you should watch or even re-watch them instead of this, I don't know if they were ever broadcast on TV in the US (btw I'm French). To be fair, I will conclude by saying children are bound to like this movie (especially the lame captain Haddock), but that's it. I really wish you good luck if your children want you to go to this movie with them. I went with friends and we only had fun by seeing parents who were boring while their children were enjoying the movie. That is to say we didn't get much fun neither, but at least we tried to ...<br/><br/>PS: I forgot to mention they didn't even made a soundtrack for this, which makes the film even more boring."
"loujordan","1","23","48","21 December 2011"," epic fail, I expected anything better
","this was the least entertaining film I've seen in a long time. I never read a Tintin book, I don't know the story, I just knew Spielberg knows how to make great films and went blindly in to experience something great. It was horrible. From start to finish, I felt like I was watching TV on Nick Jr., nothing compelling in the story, nothing funny about it even though they throw bad joke after bad joke at you relentlessly.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, if you are taking a 6-9 year old to this movie, you are in the right boat. And it is a great technical example of what they can do with digital rendering and 3-D. Just don't expect much depth or something that'll last in your head or heart. It's like a teenager wrote this, not a professional artist.<br/><br/>It was a total waste of an evening out with my wife who felt exactly the same about the movie. I'm generally open and forgiving, but this was an epic fail."
"jafar-iqbal","7","2","2","21 November 2012"," A very fun entertainer
","Those of you old enough might remember the Tintin show that, if I'm correct, used to come on Channel 4 early in the mornings. It was great, really fun to watch. So I had a keen interest in the movie when it was announced, especially after knowing that it was being directed by one Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>The Secret Of The Unicorn is about Tintin (Jamie Bell), the brave young journalist always on the lookout for a story. Purchasing a model of a ship propels him into an epic adventure across the world, assisted by the drunk Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), and thwarted by the evil Sakharine (Daniel Craig).<br/><br/>Since it released in the cinema, I've seen this movie about four times, and I always enjoy it. Mostly because it has all that charm you expect from a Spielberg charm, but with the added bonus of it being a motion capture animation. The digital effects are absolutely sublime, and need to be seen in HD to be properly appreciated. The highlight has to be the incredible chase sequence involving Snowy the dog and an eagle, with blatant comparisons to Indiana Jones and The Goonies apparent. On the other hand, there are sequences in the movie which are perhaps a bit too far-fetched. Yes, it's an animated film, but we're trained to think of this as 'real life'.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, it's a good affair. I think Andy Serkis is the star of the show; Haddock is a great character, and he does it justice. It's fun to see Daniel Craig do something a bit sillier than usual, and Jamie Bell is his usual solid self. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg are comic relief, somewhat, but their talents are wasted, I think.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this a thumbs-up. Whether you're a fan of the original books, or the TV show like me, you'll enjoy this cinematic version. With a sequel already earmarked (especially considering the end of this movie), this could turn into a very successful franchise. Good stuff."
"ryancauchifilms","7","2","2","12 August 2012"," A reasonably satisfying, fast-paced romp for all ages
","Since 1929, 'The Adventures of Tintin' by Belgian artist Hergé has been delighting children and adults alike with its bold, unique visuals and engaging stories of adventure, global intrigue and mystery. The exploits of this wide-eyed, globe-trotting reporter and his lovable pooch Snowy, have been translated in over 50 languages and adapted into every conceivable medium. Perhaps the most popular incarnation of the character was the animated series produced in 1991 by Canadian entertainment company Nelvana. For this reviewer, it was a staple of after school television viewing – it closely replicated Hergé's signature style and had some pretty spot-on voice acting and music. <br/><br/>When it was announced in May 2007 that master filmmakers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson would be collaborating on a 3D animated film based on the beloved comic strip, it quickly became one of the most anticipated films in recent Hollywood history. But when the November 2010 issue of Empire Magazine released the first production stills from Spielberg/Jackson's TINTIN, I was shocked. The characters – Tintin, Snowy and their rarely sober companion Captain Haddock – looked like they had just disembarked from THE POLAR EXPRESS. They were dead-eyed, creepy and uncannily lifelike. Hergé's distinctive texture and style seemed absent altogether. I adore Spielberg and Jackson but this left me wishing that a traditional animator like Sylvian Chomet (THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE, THE ILLUSIONIST) were at the helm of this film. And all those trailers and web documentaries that followed didn't do much to change my opinion that THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN would rank among other fan-boy disappointments such as SPEED RACER and ASTRO BOY. <br/><br/>Thankfully, this reviewer was only partially correct. <br/><br/>From its fun, Saul Bass-inspired opening credits sequence (think Spielberg's CATCH ME IF YOU CAN) to the very last scene, THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN is a reasonably satisfying, fast- paced romp. It may not be as charming or absorbing as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, but it certainly succeeds in the 'family adventure' sub-genre. <br/><br/>The screenplay by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish combines elements of 'The Crab and the Golden Claws' (1943), 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' (both published in 1945), and reunites KING KONG costars Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis – as Tintin and Captain Haddock, respectively – for an around-the-world adventure for a lost family treasure. Both actors, especially Serkis, the undisputed 'go-to' guy for motion-capture acting, give pretty okay performances and are accompanied by a colorful supporting cast; including Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who provide welcome comic relief as bumbling detectives Thomson and Thompson, and Daniel Craig, who plays against type as our nefarious villain Ivanovitch Sakharine - who I swear is a self-portrait of Spielberg himself! Sadly Toby Jones, Tony Curran and Gad Elmaleh as Tintin favorites Silk, Lieutenant Delacourt and Omar Ben Salaad are given very little to do. <br/><br/>While the quasi-human designs of the characters will outrage some Hergé purists, this film is undoubtedly another technical achievement for special effects house Weta Digital, who earlier this year gave us the very compelling chimps in that other Serkis vehicle RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES. The animation is detailed and meticulous and certainly improves on what Robert Zemeckis (BEOWULF, A Christmas CAROL) and other pioneers of the format have achieved in the past. Proof of this is the spectacular battle at sea between Haddock and Sakharine's ancestors, Sir Francis Haddock and Red Rackham (also played by Serkis and Craig). This is one of Spielberg's finest action sequences, combining impressive tracking shots and madcap action, with some of the most creative scene transitions ever committed to cinema. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the climactic chase through Morocco. All done in one shot, it is innovative at first, but questionable and tiresome by the end. <br/><br/>There are few nice 'for-the-fans' moments, such as a very clever cameo appearance by Hergé at the beginning of the film. Yet some things may prove a little hurting, such as the absence of the eccentric Professor Calculus (who featured prominently in 'Red Rackham's Treasure') or the memorable scene in 'The Crab and the Golden Claws' when a hallucinating Haddock mistakes our hero for a bottle of grog. Hopefully these will find their way into the sequel, which is set to be directed by Jackson. <br/><br/>So, was it Hergé's Tintin? No. Was it Spielberg's best film? Definitely not. But it is still worth a look!"

","""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"" is one of the finest motion capture animation movie yet . It is made with Steven Spielberg at its helm is no surprise for he is master in using the latest technology to the hilt for the benefit of his movies.<br/><br/>As a person not exposed to the ""Tintin"" series of comic novels in his younger age I went into the theaters with an open mind , excitation of watching a movie in 3D boosted by very nice things written & told about the movie in the media as well as word of mouth.<br/><br/>The most striking & prominent thing that comes to once mind is that watching the first sequence only made one go speechless about the technical wizardry of the creators. One has not come across such an awesomely made animation in 3D so far. Except for the comic book like humans everything else look better than the natural ambiances.<br/><br/>The house , books , birds , deserts, ocean , river , ship , palaces , ....all are done with such minute precision & flavor that one can't but appreciate the hard work of all those involved in its creation.<br/><br/>When it comes to the movie per se since I was naive to the ""Tintin"" series of comics , I found the story & the happenings on screen a bit childish. The story of a young journalist trying to solve the secret of the Unicorn , a ship which carried loads of treasure on-board which got sunk when pirates attacked it in one of its voyages with the help of the descendant of the captain of the original ship. That there is another person , Ivan Sakharine , who is supposedly descendant of the chief pirate who attacked the ship in the past , is also on the pursuit of the treasure that got lost along with the ship. The ensuing cat & mouse game is the story.<br/><br/>Story wise there is nothing much to expect considering it is based on a comic book catering to the age group of 3 to 15. May be the story might have enthralled those who are familiar with the comics when they were younger & might have given them the chance to relive those days of innocence & liveliness . But those who are not familiar with the comic series it won't affect much , myself being one such.<br/><br/>Technically as said earlier the movie is top class. It will be the bench mark for all other live animation movies to follow to emulate. The technical team at Weta Digital should get all the credits that are due for them.<br/><br/>John Williams background score is good aids in transforming the viewers to the comic book world.<br/><br/>On the whole , ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"" is an enthralling piece of work best enjoyed in a 3D digital theater & is worth every penny spent.<br/><br/>Bottomline : For the child in you..."

My main reason for watching this was because it was a Spielberg movie. After about ten minutes I was hooked. This is one of the few family movies that is actually a movie that adults can watch without feeling like its a chore. The best way to describe this is that it is a cartoon version of ""Indiana Jones"". The good ones, before Lucas added aliens.

"smirnoff103","Null","14","27","31 October 2011"," A bit too much of everything
","I went to see the movie the first weekend it was released here in Belgium with some big expectations due to the role the movie had here in the Belgian media before its release.<br/><br/>I heard the intro was ""stunning & creative"" etc. but this was the first deception. It was a simple 2D animated composition with the covers of the Tintin albums where you see the cast, nothing special.<br/><br/>But from the moment the first frame started I was simply blown away by it's CG. It's really like you are thinking ""is this 3D or real ?"". With only the exception of the faces of the characters everything looked real to me. The first scene is ""shot"" in Brussels on the ""Place du Jeu de balle"" from the Marolles district where there is a daily famous flea market. That same flea market is shown in the shot, where a caricaturist (who is clearly Hergé) is doing a drawing for a customer who sits in front of him. When the drawing is finish he gives it to that customer with the words ""There you go, I think it's quite resembling..."" on that sketch is the (famous) Tintin portrait in 2D, you then understand that that customer is Tintin. This was for me a nice & original allusion to Hergé in the movie.<br/><br/>The storyline is a mix of ""The Secret Of The Unicorn"" together with ""The Crab With The Golden Claws"" with a few changes. The sheikh in the movie is a ""good"" guy and not a drug baron (although it's not 100% clear if he's not) like in the album and Bianca Castafiore appears in the movie too. The part in Baghar (a fictive port city in Morocco) is also different than in the album. They escape from the sheikhs house and are pursued by his guard and by Sakharin (the bad guy in the movie) and his men. This scene is really too much exaggerated for me and is not what would happen in a Tintin album could happen. It gave me more the impression that I was in a scene from Uncharted 2 (a video game) with that bike and collapsing buildings than in a Tintin movie.<br/><br/>The movie ends like in the Secret of the Unicorn album too and has an open end (like in the album) into the direction of the album ""Red Rackham's Treasure"".<br/><br/>That's ""in short"" what the movie is about story wise, the scenario is rather well written and the mix of both stories is also nicely done, the extra elements are believable and possible and gives an extra dimension to the story. During the movie I also saw a few camera angles that were typically ""comic book-ish"" like it was directly from a still of the album. But what really irritate me in the movie was all the ""special camera moves"" in the movie, like the hundred ""pass through"" elements and so on. The movie was also quite short in comparison with other movies.<br/><br/>In short, it's really a ""sick"" movie for CG and the story is interesting but ""tribute-wise"" it's a bit too ""Americanized"" (with ""action-action-action"" most the time) and some jokes are more ""Looney Tunes""-ish (like the belch of Haddock in the airplane tank), and that's clearly not what Hergé's work is about.<br/><br/>I think I might go check the next (if there will be some) movies only for the CG and to see the mixes of different stories but I think at the end I will be a bit disappointed too."

","I always thought that Tintin was a bit more serious and thoughtful, but as I was afraid of, Spielberg can ruin even this fine character with his one-note silly childish Indiana Jones style. Oh how I am bored with it.... That wasn't really a Tintin story but just another kids' movie squeezed into that guaranteed money making format which is as exciting as picking up same brand bubblegum over and over never ever considering anything else.<br/><br/>Storywise there was no climax in the story, maybe because it was a combination of multiple stories. Silliness and action just ruined every possible moment. And that too obvious cliffhanger at the end was just like a slap in your face: ""Pay more, you fool.""<br/><br/>I give 6 just for this being Tintin and the fact that the shoes had nice details.

"martinrobertson300482","7","13","27","26 October 2011"," What a total nostalgia trip!
","I had many off the ""Tintin"" books when I was a kid, and fondly remember the Sunday morning cartoon. So was super thrilled that Steven Spielberg off all people was tackling a movie version.<br/><br/>First off, the fact that this movie is 3 off the original stories mixed together will probably not please everyone. But I welcomed it as a way off bringing these characters too the big screen, and in a way that is familiar but not exactly the same as I remember. The thing this film had going for it over everything was its nostalgia, and it still had many moments that provided that, even if it was truly trying too fit a little too much into the one movie (I'm pretty sure there's a fourth original story mixed in here somewhere but I'm not entirely sure!) <br/><br/>This new ""Tintin"" movie has more than a whiff off ""Raiders of the lost arc"" about it, which will also divide audiences. I however liked that it was as if Spielberg was back on familiar turf, and bringing this character to life in a way he, as well as others would off envisioned it anyway. Indeed, there is so much talent involved in this film, it's hard to imagine anyone not admitting too how well made it is, even if they do disagree with its direction. Spielberg does a terrific job, and the voice actors are all amazing. Yes, even Andy Serkis as a ""Scottish"" captain Haddock. Daniel Craig especially though, is surprisingly ace as the villain off the film.<br/><br/>Film is action packed too and is actually funny. I don't quite remember laughing as much at the old cartoons, even though they were at times attempting to be funny. My greatest fear was that the totally irritating Thompson twins would ruin the movie. But someone here has made the right decision off not having them in the movie much, but having them in there a little as it wouldn't be the same without them for many I'm sure. The same can't be said for captain Haddock however, who gets a serious amount off screen time, perhaps even more than Tintin himself. Heck, you could even say this was a ""Captain Haddock"" movie, not a ""Tintin"" one.<br/><br/>All off the films cons seem too be outweighed by pro's however. There's even no faulting the ""charmless"" motion capture animation, as the film is often trying too be as amazingly visual as possible, and for the most part - succeeding. I can't help but think that there is perhaps too much action though. The original cartoons were never as far fetched as this adventure un-ashamedly is . There are many ""cartoony"" moments that seem un-fitting, and some off the over the top spectacle has clearly just been thrown in there in an attempt too impress us with ever more tiresome 3D."

","Saw this while spending Christmas stateside with my in-laws.<br/><br/>I was asked if Tintin was really big in England. I said no. Most of the fasmily seem to think Britain loves Tintin so I guess this was some marketing ploy for the US. To be honest in the UK my family never goes to the movies for Christmas but when in Rome.<br/><br/>Anyhoo I had read some euphoric reviews on here so my expectations were quite high. All I can say is that the reviews were either by fanboys or studio plants because I found Tintin to be a dry experience.<br/><br/>Surprisingly given the names involved the cinema was less than a third full. There wasn't much reaction except to one striking scene. Obviously I'm far too old for Tintin but I got the impression that some younger viewers- not from my party- were not into it.<br/><br/>Oh well, even if the flick was weak a Xmas visit to the pictures made a welcome change of pace."
"CinemaClown","Null","3","4","15 May 2015"," Underwhelming!
","From the filmmaker who has enriched the world cinema with some of the most adventurous, dazzling & unforgettable films ever made, The Adventures of Tintin marks a couple of firsts for Steven Spielberg. In a massively successful career that spans 4 decades, it's his very first foray into the medium of animation & also marks his first stint with digital filmmaking.<br/><br/>Based on the immensely popular comic book series by Hergé, the story of The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn follows the fearless journalist Tintin, his pet dog Snowy & the permanently drunk Captain Haddock who together set off on an adventure to unearth the secret of a ship that sank 300 years ago & was once commanded by one of Haddock's ancestors.<br/><br/>Co-written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright & Joe Cornish, produced by Peter Jackson and directed by Steven Spielberg, The Adventures of Tintin opens with a brilliantly composed opening credits sequence that wonderfully pays its homage to its source material but after that, it feels like an inconsistent mash-up of Hergé's Tintin & Spielberg's Indiana Jones that isn't as rewarding as expected.<br/><br/>Spielberg's direction is still worthy of mention for he shows a great comfort in what is a new filmmaking experience for him & is never hesitant to try a few experiments with the camera, for animation makes possible a number of sequences that would be too difficult to capture in a live-action scenario. The editing however is a mixed bag for it fails to provide a tighter plot & a brisker pace would've sufficed a lot.<br/><br/>The animation is gorgeous for the rendering captures the authentic ambiance of the comics, every frame is richly detailed, characters aren't entirely computer-generated as is the case in most animated features but make use of motion-capture to bring the real performances of the actors behind the voices, and the ever dependable John Williams once again chips in with an adventurous, mesmerising & light-hearted score.<br/><br/>The cast consists of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg & others and all of them chip in with fairly good performances. The characters look exactly like their comic book drawings, the voice acting as well as the motion-capture performance by all is commendable, Tintin's beloved dog Snowy is a great comic relief & whether it's humour or entertainment, the film has a few cheering moments for everyone.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is underwhelming as far as what was expected from it but it still makes up for a good ride, if not a great one. The entire picture feels like the writers were unsure which aspect to favour more: character depth or big-screen spectacle, & they end up half-way on both. Nevertheless, the film promises plenty of fun, entertainment & wonders to its viewers. It's just that it won't be remembered in the years to come."

","As a fan of Hergé's comic book series, Peter Jackson, Steven Spielberg and Andy Serkis, this film was a must see for me. And I wasn't disappointed! It was fun, action packed, enjoyable, well made and had a great score by John Williams.<br/><br/>The story's basically a bunch of Tintin comics merged in one epic adventure, but it's mostly based on 'The Secret of the Unicorn' (and possibly the sequel will be 'The Treasure of Red Rackham!) and it has some great little treats for the fan-boys. The motion capture technology really delivered, the characters looked amazing, halfway into the movie I even forgot I was watching animation.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis did a really good job, I loved him as Captain Haddock, who was my favorite character in the comics too. The storyline was great, lot of funny scenes and lines, I had a great time at the movies. I recommend it to those who are familiar with Hergé's series or are fans of Spielberg and Indiana Jones or just great action-adventure movies in general."

","Avatar's motion capture techniques showed what was technically possible with the new computer toybox at film directors disposal. Spielberg and Peter Jackson clearly wanted to play in the digital sandbox but needed a film to demonstrate what they could do.<br/><br/>Tintin is perhaps a suitable choice, realistically he would not work with real actors and creating the action inside the computer, allows literally anything to be shown on the big screen.<br/><br/>Crash landing airplanes in the desert, intricate chases set in a bazaar with impossible stunts, fifty gun galleon's firing broadsides in monstrous seas, Spielberg directs like a kid let loose in a chocolate factory.<br/><br/>Jamie Bell fleshes out the eponymous Tintin with bad guy duties falling to Daniel Craig as Sakharine. Captain Haddock, who spends the entire film in pursuit of his next whisky bottle is provided via Andy Serkis, no stranger to these new acting techniques.<br/><br/>It is interesting to see echos of the actors through their motion capture work, not just in their voices but in their facial actions, the way they move, walk and act.<br/><br/>For the uninitiated, Tintin is a ""cub"" reporter providing newspaper articles on fantastic adventures and scrapes that he often finds himself embroiled in, all set within a largely recognisable 20th century backdrop. The film is based on three of the many books written by Herge', this is classic boys own adventure stuff, lots of derring do in a wholesome family kind of way.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around sunken hidden treasure and a model ship, ""The Unicorn"", which is a good excuse to bring pirates, generational revenge and other dastardly plans into the mix. The story wends it's way through a Junior ""Indiana Jones"" sequence of events and is accompanied by a rousing John Williams score to suit the action on screen.<br/><br/>Tintin is aided by the ""Thompson Twins"" (Frost and Pegg) who are part of Interpol but are inherently inept and stereotypically British, including obligatory bowler hats and umbrellas. Whilst they are designed as the comic relief, here they do not add to the story and tend to drag the action down whenever they are on the screen, notably the wallet scene which appears childish and out of place.<br/><br/>The ""animation"" is beautifully done, clearly pushing the envelope of just what is possible even further ahead. With almost infinite camera angles at his disposal with the new technique, Spielberg has fun mixing up how the audience views the action. Tintin appears real, the audience complaint of ""dead eyes"" and the simulation of realistic sea and water issues, obviously now fixed. The technique pioneer, ""The Polar Express"" is already beginning to look quaintly old fashioned and creaky in comparison.<br/><br/>Star of the show must be ""Snowy"", Tintin's ever present canine friend. Animated to perfection, with all the best action, looks and comic touches. Pet shops will need to stock up on Wire Fox Terriers, to keep up with demand.<br/><br/>The film is fun and obviously orientated towards a family audience, the Thompson twins do mar the action but the film recovers with some excellent sequences, notably a post plane crash propeller incident, dueling port cranes and an exciting motor-cycle sidecar chase.<br/><br/>Interestingly released in the UK and Europe before the US, as the character is perhaps better known on the European side of the Atlantic.<br/><br/>Looks good in 3D with some decent depth gags but probably not compulsory to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Provided the film is not taken to seriously, there is much to enjoy. Superb action with fantastic state of the art motion capture and CGI animation techniques.<br/><br/>Kids will love the film and there is sufficient depth to keep most parents interested and the send off certainly indicates there is more of Tintin to come.<br/><br/>Recommended, especially for big ""Snowy"" fans<br/><br/>http://www.julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"
"tedg","Null","4","6","10 January 2012"," WETA Gold
","There are only three ways to turn on your mind. The third is too dangerous to even sketch.<br/><br/>The most common is to allow it to do what it wants, tracing known pathways and presenting known patterns. All imagination comes home to rest.<br/><br/>But then there is art, which in my book is able to coax the imagination out of the familiar. Sometimes this immediately extends what you know, making your house bigger. Sometimes it centers on that oldest of organizational keys: space. Sometimes it is cinematic. That's what we have here, sometimes.<br/><br/>Oh, there is the story-stuff, inherited from a Belgian comic. That is discardable. And there is the cloying story-boarding of Spielberg who I believe is living with the growing fear that he will die never having made something essential.<br/><br/>But behind all that is the WETA parts of this film. Spielberg does his spiel in telling the story. And he gets the lion's share of the money and credit because he owns the property. But he turned all the spatial management over to Peter Jackson and his special effects house, WETA. And we are far better off for it.<br/><br/>Elsewhere, I have celebrated what WETA digital fx has done, which is to take the concepts pioneered by Pixar and extend them in deliberate, engineered excess. The Pixar idea was to reinvent the personality of the camera. Since it is a virtual perspective, it can use space and movement beyond what we accept at the range of a physical camera. Much of Pixar's success, I believe, is in how they reframe who the viewer is in the story by reinventing how our eye discovers.<br/><br/>The Pixar ideal is to do this in ways that are imperceptible. The WETA philosophy is to always be a bit beyond the comfort level, always overloading our mental abilities to sort things out spatially. This both gives an exhilarating film experience and on each viewing an extension of how the mind sees. It literally expands our ability to perform spatial reasoning — which for most of us is most of our reasoning.<br/><br/>We saw this in the Lord of the Rings projects, which despite cumbersome story and distracting heroics were visually aggressive. I believe that 'King Kong' was made solely to perfect some insights, which I presume come from founder Jamie Selkirk.<br/><br/>(The weta is a species of insect unique to New Zealand which comes in a broad variety, filling the role that in the rest of the world is taken by mammals. (New Zealand has none.). A common characteristic, the one every kiwi child knows, is the ability to jump aggressively. They have been essentially unchanged for 500 billion times longer than the average film, yet every jump of the bush weta is unique. Without wings, they have the ability to perturb their path. You can see the analogy in the movements of the camera in earlier projects, like 'King Kong.')<br/><br/>There are three scenes here where it is obvious that Spielberg turned over complete control. The first is a seabattle between two ships. This is pretty darn masterful, because the Pixar/WETA camera philosophy has been used in an ironic, comic way in the later 'Pirates of the Caribbean' episodes. You can see the anti-irony here where the battle is truly between the inventors and masters of the treasured technique, and the Disney (and now Pixar itself) thieves. I was ecstatic.<br/><br/>The second is a chase scene through a Morrocan village which was a pure advance over anything that has come before. Here there is no irony, though movie buffs will find a great many references to other chase scenes as reimagined by better camera perspectives. Two I will tell you to look for are the reference to the Geena Davis stagecoach chase in 'Cutthroat Island' and the little girl parkour chase in the recent 'Columbiana.'<br/><br/>See this in 3D.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
"aslett","9","7","13","25 March 2012"," The world reinvented
","Spielberg won't get the credit he deserves for it. That's the way it is with successful directors. If this was by a relatively new presence we would be fawning over them, calling them a genius. (Or genii, as this involves at least two big talents, Spielberg and Peter Jackson). Remember what was said about Monet? ""Just an eye, but what an eye!"" Well, these two men each have a fantastic eye and more than that in spades. It is a good story if not a great story. Young Tintin buys a model boat that is stolen by villains and he is sucked into a mystery involving lost treasure and family vengeance. The cartoon element of the characters does detract from our emotional involvement, as does the peculiarly uncomplicated nature of the hero. But I think everyone should see this movie because of the way it blurs our distinction between the world and its imitation. Those same people who criticized Spiderman's CGI movements might well have occasional words to say here but I'll ignore them too. This is not the comic brought to life or the real world in animation. Not a Toy Story or an Avatar. This is the world reinvented. You can do what you want now, unhindered by bleary eyed actors with agendas of their own. Forget gravity or rainy days – unless they help the story. Jackson's production company has produced a world that sparkles like our own. (Perhaps better if you come from the same place I do). Andy Serkis is the star (for me) and does a fantastic turn as Captain Haddock with a raw Scottish accent that happily rises to a Sean Connery impersonation from time to time. I say 'happily' because the villain is played by another Bond, Daniel Craig who would have done better to showboat a little to keep up. Jamie Bell has a direct, youthful, no-messing part as Tintin – a wise choice as he never sounds whiny. The brilliant pair of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are unnecessary as the overly stupid Thompson Twins. But things other than people crave your attention too because they appear to have been created with such care: the swell of the waves, flaming sails, the glimmer of cobbles, inky clouds around crackling lightening, the glow of skin in sunlight, and on and on It has to be compared to Martin Scorcese's more human Hugo for a variety of reasons but I'll mention only one. Scorcese begins his film in a suitably cinematic and impressive way with an impossible long take in Hitchcock fashion, the camera wending its way like the eye of a God narrator, through windows and buildings and over constrictive machinery. Spielberg waits nearly an hour and a half before giving us a two and a half minute sequence of continuous choreographed adventure. It's a chase for secret documents, the maguffin, down a sparkling hillside in North Africa on a motorbike that will eventually fall apart while buildings are torn asunder and characters woven in and out of frame in a complexity that boggles the brain. The thing to do is forget your qualms and skepticism about CGI and animation. It's a film I wish I could watch as a young boy in 12 B.C. (Before Critics)."

","Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson teamed up to produce what was supposed to be the greatest adventure tale since ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Instead they have produced a 130 million dollar albatross that will likely hang around their necks for years to come.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm exaggerating. Perhaps I'm too sensitive to the fact that a childhood hero like Spielberg is capable of churning out such mediocre fare. Perhaps its just sour grapes that talented scribes like Joe Cornish, Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright fumbled on a comic book adaptation that can write itself with the amount of mythology embedded in it. Perhaps I'm overreacting to the fact that the directors of ""Schindler's List"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" produced a bloated spectacle in Zemeckis-vision whose plot can be surmised in four words (those words are 'Tintin searches for treasure' by the way).<br/><br/>The story intertwines the lives of a dull protagonist (Jamie Bell), his intelligent dog a drunken sea captain (Andy Serkis) and an evil ne'er-do-well with a 150 year old family grudge (Daniel Craig), all looking for hidden treasure in a paint-by-numbers adventure. The cast then participate in a series of increasingly elaborate and admittedly dazzling action set-pieces to find their elusive macguffin. That's basically it. There's no B-story, moral or point. After a ten minute setup, the film is essentially one big long car chase only with boats, planes, and motorcycles in addition to cars.<br/><br/>This is not to say it isn't exciting. If that's all you're looking for in a film ""Tintin"" is a perfect holiday treat. I would even recommend seeing it in 3D since Spielberg technical talents are on full display. But for those of us craving a little more meat on the bone, this film will bring out your inner cynic, right down to last few sequel-baiting minutes.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"
"guyincognito1","8","7","13","29 October 2011"," Ultimately impressive effort
","Now, I can understand why both critics and average Tintin fans alike might have felt a little let down by the story. Spielberg and Jackson merged two stories into one, and while others may feel that this was a negative aspect of the film, I maintain that it was the most practical (and effective) thing to do. After all, we need some knowhow as to why Tintin and Haddock meet, otherwise it is just confusing for all those people who haven't read a Tintin comic in their life. <br/><br/>I must admit,this is the first time I have experienced Tintin in English (having read all but one in their original French) and it was very impressive how they were translated into English, although I doubt Spielberg even glanced at a French copy, and merely used the English. There have been comments as to the non-heroics of our 'hero' as opposed to 'Snowy', who really steals the show. But in the comics, it IS always Snowy who does the real work, the amount of times he saves Tintin are uncountable! One thing I will say though, is that the motion capture coupled with the CGI made a slightly weird contrast to Spielbergs love of close-ups, and not in a good way. Otherwise, it gave the movie a real comic-book atmosphere. For me, this has been a real privilege to watch, and a joy to see one of my childhood heroes brought to life. It's a bit too like Spielberg's other films to merit a nine (no film is ever worth ten), but ultimately this is a genuinely good film."
"rkitextwo","2","9","18","3 January 2012"," Not PG
","I have to say I am disturbed by this movie, only because it's rated PG. The animation is amazing. Very real. One might ask ""why animate it then""? But that's another topic. My review is only regarding the inappropriate content for a PG movie. There were many scenes with guns and swords. A man getting shot dead right at Tin Tin's door. I was really shocked. Multiple gun fights, swords fights, knives. One of my kids said ""I was really surprised by all of the guns, I wasn't expecting that."" Mind you, he loved it, but it just wasn't appropriate. Also, the alcohol references were very abundant. My son said ""I thought the drunk parts were funny."" That's nice. My 9 year old son thinks being drunk is funny. I think the violence and alcohol were over the top. I'm only reviewing this movie because as parents we depend on the rating system. Ten years ago, there is no way that would have passed as PG. I review all content for PG-13 movies. I shouldn't have to do that for PG movies. The fact that's it's animated may make some believe that you can ""get away"" with cartoon violence, but this movie is so real, you can't even tell it's animated is some parts."

","After I finished watching this movie I still couldn't understand what was the story?

Captain Haddock became a drunk scott, they used too many puns in one sentence at times, felt like he was a liability instead of a helping hand, wont mention too much about the plane scene 'physics' burp for fuel?, crane wars? what were they thinking. Even the pirate scene didn't help there was more to it than just that. All the characters were better portrayed in the cartoon than the movie they don't have them all like the professor. I remember the twins Thomson and Thompson kept changing their disguises, Haddock had hiccups (*hic*) when he was drinking, snowy was more adorable had thought bubbles on dogbones or what would happen to him or trying to explain to tintin what he was saying. Tintin was not much of a sleuth in this movie everything just happened to fall into his lap, originally I'm sure he sometimes said ""lets search for clues"" and he pulls out a magnifying glass and starts elaborating on his findings etc and each clue would lead to another, which was better told in the comics than the movie.<br/><br/>Its so bad you could fall asleep, the only thing good was the introduction with the paintings reminiscent of Tintin and in one scene tintin had just one bullet to take down an airplane that was so funny in a corny way."

","...or as we say in Dutch: ""Duizend bommen & granaten!""<br/><br/>Like you've probably noticed I went to see 'The Adventures of TinTin: The Secret of the Unicorn'. To be exact; I saw it yesterday, a week after the world premiere here in Brussels, Belgium. I don't want to spoil a lot about the movie, because I'm aware that people from the USA have to wait until the movie arrives in their theatres on the 21 of December 2011.<br/><br/>As a Belgian it is quite logical to know who TinTin (Dutch translation: 'Kuifje', literally translated in English it would be 'Tuft' because of his hair) is. The comics of TinTin are quite known and popular here because of Hergé his Belgian origin. Also because of the fine memorabilia that you can get of TinTin, Snowy, Haddock, ...<br/><br/>But back to the movie review. I had quite high expectations with this movie. The reasons are simple; 'Will Spielberg honour Hergé's heritage?', 'Will TinTin be the TinTin we all knew and grew up with?', 'Is there a chance that the characters will loose their power of imagination and innocence when they talk and move?', ...<br/><br/>Well... I'm happy to say that Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson did a marvelous job. They took the effort to know TinTin and do him honour. You get to know the brave, unselfish and energetic TinTin. You see how loyal and fearless Snowy is. Or how much of a goof Capitain Haddock is, but also very proud of his background. You'll see how confused and know-it-all Thomson and Thompson are in their own humorous ways. Really if you are a TinTin fanatic or you just appreciate TinTin, you will find pleasure in the characters and the storyline.<br/><br/>Now, an other aspect of the movie is the fact that it's in 3D. And I do believe it was the right choice to wait and film it in 3D because, believe me, it was beyond beautiful. For me 3D is about details details and details. If you can't take the effort to make it as real as possible, you better don't start with it. But yet again, they did a splendid job. The first 10 seconds of the movie I was blown away because I thought it wasn't an animation movie that I was watching but a real one. It's from the moment that you see the people their faces that you notice that it is an animation movie. Not in a bad way, because the people had the typical characteristic features that all of Hergé his characters have. Which I was glad to see because that made the experience of hergé his comics coming alive more fantastic. But like I said it was all in the details. If you saw a close-up shot of TinTin for example, you saw the little hairs on his head moving in the wind. Or you saw the leaves of the trees in the background slowly moving like leaves do in real life. There are also a few scenes that took place on the sea (in broad day light or at night) and it was amazing how real it all looked. you could imagine yourself standing at the coastline and experience the glistening of the sun on the sea surface. Also the transitions from old to knew or from a scene to a new scene were scrupulous done. I just loved it and admired it.<br/><br/>It's just amazing to see a comic coming alive. A comic with a special style, clear lines, in a way kind of atypical compared to other comics.<br/><br/>So for those who love TinTin, or for those who love animation coming alive in 3D, or for those who just like a good movie that is easy to follow and that makes you laugh. Go and see 'The Adventures of TinTin'. It would be hard to believe that you will leave the theatres disappointed after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the next adventure of TinTin.<br/><br/>J."

","Being a fan of tin tin from my younger days i was utterly disappointed with this tin tin flick! the story line has been changed in to just action sequences, no character development what so ever and here i said it again the story has been changed in to a piece of garbage!!!! now the cgi is good but if you are a tin tin reader you will hate what they have done with the story!!! i guess part of the fun with tin tin was the characters but here you don't get much connection to them! the last good movie Spielberg did is years ,many years before just like George Lucas they just hang on to their past glories. capitan horlock is gone from the parts of story and he is the coolest character there.

"zhangyingmath","3","6","11","2 January 2012"," point out a few flaws
","Having been a big Tintin fan since I was 11 years old, I am a bit disappointed by this one, even though it is a Spielberg. The picture and the 3D aren't too fancy. Actually, for both TVs and films adaptations, I have found nothing able to convey the subtlety and 'gentleman like leisure' in Herge's cartoon. I mean, in the cartoon even when Tintin, Haddock or Professor Calculus was in danger, they would always walk out with ease like gentlemen. That's Herge's humor. But in the film all is lost. Let me just point out a few things: 1. In the cartoon even Haddock was often drunk, alcohol almost never got in his way of anything. 2. Nester, servant at Marlinspike hall, never talks that much ! 3. The fight in Morroco, with the plane, motors and tanks reminded me of 'raiders of the lost arc', while Tintin's glide down the hilly town reminded me of Rio de Janeiro as in 'Rio'. Come on, show us something new please!"
"thanhlienanh-vo","7","6","11","14 November 2011"," Decent animation, bad Tintin movie
","Short review: As a regular animation, this is a decent one. Fluid motion, beautiful visual, fabulous action scenes, you got it on. As a Tintin movie, this is a bad one and I hate it.<br/><br/>Granted, the opening says ""based on the story"", so technically it's not a theatrical adaptation, just ""based on"". For all Tintin readers out there (I don't dare to say ""fans"" as I do not claim myself a fan, but I read Tintin throughout my childhood), the movie will not relive your memory in its glory.<br/><br/>The story do not follow closely with the original The Secret of the Unicorn. Instead, it uses the core idea of 3 leather scrolls and Red Rackham's treasure hunting, mixes up some elements from The Crab with the Golden Claws and Land of Black Gold, glorifies a minor supporting character into the main villain and thus completely change the essence of the story. I, as a purist, do not like mixed smoothies, thank you.<br/><br/>Visually the movie is stunning. I quite like the beautiful color palette. Life-like rendition of the characters and fluid animation more or less take off the minimalism flavour from the comics, but I can bear with that. After all, it gives the movie a fresh look.<br/><br/>The movie features some fabulous action scenes, as expected from any animation and as expected from Steven Spielberg. However, as I feel the essence of Tintin's adventures is more about wits and the story as a whole, having Tintin and Captain Haddock flying across Bagghar on a motorbike chasing a hawk is out of place. Lots of people will enjoy these fast-pacing and humorously breath-taking chase scenes though.<br/><br/>The rest of the complaint lies on Jamie Bell's terrible voice acting as Tintin which sounds flat and emotionless, the plain jokes that I find it hard to crack a smile, the unlikeness of Tintin as a whole (his facial expression is weird). But then again, what more can I ask?<br/><br/>As said earlier, this is not a terrible animation and I'm sure many will enjoy it. However, if you just want to watch this because of the original comics, you can skip it. Nothing will be missed. Or if you've watched it, like me, you'll have to find and read the original comics again, to purify yourself from the movies.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit: http://voicemotion.wordpress.com/"

","I have been a fan of the Tintin books since the age of seven, and so I definitely had to see Steven Spielberg's performance capture adaptation. And I must say, I am impressed. I will say that some scenes went a little overboard with the action, but otherwise ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a very fun movie. It is of course a combination of ""The Crab with Golden Claws"" and ""The Secret of the Unicorn"". I could tell what they dropped and added, and which character's roles they expanded. Overall, I am very pleased with this adaptation. Jamie Bell plays the titular young journalist/detective, although Andy Serkis is particularly neat as Capt. Haddock.<br/><br/>All in all, Hergé would be proud of this movie. I also hope that ""Hergé's Adventures of Tintin"" (the cartoon series that ran from 1959-1962) comes to DVD eventually.<br/><br/>Also starring Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost."
"MovieGeekBlog","8","8","17","23 October 2011"," Action-packed for the whole family
","For a start I was very pleased to see how respectful Spielberg was with the handling of the original material. After all, this is the man who wanted to turn Harry Potter into an American, combining several books into one (A bad, bad, bad idea Steven!). The story of this film actually combines several of the Tintin books, but as far as taking liberties that's where Spielberg stopped. Everything else is precisely how the Belgian creator, Hergé had imagined it: with that same sense of adventure, mystery, intrigue, action and fun. In other words the same mood and atmosphere that made the comics so successful (at least in Europe) and incidentally, in a way those same elements that were also at the centre of one of Spielberg's classic, Raiders of the lost ark.<br/><br/>Spielberg pays homage to Tintin's creator right from the start by having Hergé himself appearing as a street artist drawing a portrait of Tintin the way we are used to see him in the comics: pure genius!<br/><br/>On the whole I must say that I wasn't as bothered as I thought I was going to be by the motion capture animation. In fact you stop worrying about it about 5 minutes into the film. The characters look more cartoony than realistic and that helps getting away with the fact that their eyes (especially Tintin's) are slightly dead. This is first and foremost still an animated film (I can place a bet right now that it's going to be nominated at the Oscars next year, and probably it's going to win one too!). One thing is for sure: it does look magnificent! From the moody dark shadows reminiscent of those film noir from the 40s, to the great vistas straight out of a David Lean classic, the impeccable cinematography (Spielberg is even credited as Lighting Consultant) is not just beautiful but impressive and atmospheric.<br/><br/>Spielberg in his first animated venture (and his first use of 3D too!) looks like a little boy who's just been told he can do what he wants for his birthday: he appears to be liberated from any restriction he may have had on a normal feature film and seems to have a lot of fun in finding new beautifully inventive ways to transition from one scene to the next in a way you could only do in animation (or with a lot of very expensive CGI): Spielberg's camera floats, glides, flies, moves through glass, shoots straight into mirrors and gives us views which would otherwise been virtually impossible and yet, most of the times it's never showy, it's never forced or indulgent.<br/><br/>It's like watching a master at work who knows exactly where the camera should be at which time. It all culminated with one of the most impressive and perfectly executed chase sequence ever portrayed on screen. Impressive not just because of its pace and its edge-of-your-seat thrills, but also for its meticulously choreographed technique: in fact it takes place in just one impossibly-long shot, which adds to the tension and to the sense of fun. If you ever wondered why didn't they just film the whole thing for real, that sequence alone (which by itself is worth the price of the entire ticket) should serve you as an answer.<br/><br/>I just wished that same tension and fun of that sequence had been present throughout the rest of the film. Don't get me wrong, this first adventures of Tintin is a roller coaster ride like few others. Essentially it's one action set piece after another, and yet somehow I felt there was a strange tendency to resolve problems much too quickly. It's almost as if Spielberg was so preoccupied to get us to the next action sequence that he almost forgot how to makes like the one we were watching. I give you a few examples: a chase sequence at the front of the film, ends much too soon before it has time to climax. Later on there's a scene where Tintin has to steal a key from a bunch of sleeping goons. A lot of time is spent setting up the dangers and then just when the sequence is about to get fun, Tintin gets the key. There's another scene where Tintin faints close to the propellers of a plane and once again he gets saved much too quickly.<br/><br/>The comedy aspect of the film is a bit of a hit and miss: the Inspector Thompson and Thomson are obviously aimed at the younger crowd, but they're also the weakest characters (we had a glimpse of that in the trailer itself, as one of them falls off the stairs: a scene which in the theatre where I was, full of kids, was received with dead silence), on the other hand Captain Haddock is perfect. I don't know whether it's the script, or Andy Serkis's performance or both, but most of the jokes around him seem to work perfectly. Same goes for the little dog Snowy who is in almost every scene of the film, even if just in the background licking a massive bone in the desert. The audience I was with seemed to love him and so did I.<br/><br/>And finally Tintin himself which in this whole 3D world is probably the most two-dimensional character. Aside from the fact that he seems to get a kick out of solving puzzles and getting into adventures, we know very little about him. I'm not really blaming Spielberg for that, this exactly how Tintin was in the comics, but I do wonder if some character development would have been really seen as sacrilegious by the hard-code fans. Certainly not by me.<br/><br/>My full review here http://wp.me/p19wJ2-ro"

","Well, Im not a big fan of Tin Tin nor have I seen any of the series or episodes or even on TV. Last night, i got a chance to watch a paid preview of Tintin and to tell you honestly, its not that good. Firstly, the 3D was not that impressive. I would advise watch it in 2D. ( You wont miss anything much). Half of the film, i was able to remove the 3D glasses and actually see it more brighter and crisp in 2D. ( seems to me only some scenes were 3D). Secondly, There is not much story or twist of anything. Its just a normal boy chasing for a map to different parts of the globe which I feel even Puss n Boots could do without being called a detective. The story was simple but I left the theater in the end wondering to myself as to why I couldn't wait to watch this at home and why did I spend 300 bucks to watch it. Hmmmm. Actually, I then realized because I had read so many reviews on IMDb saying its awesome that I just fell for it. Then I realized half of this can be paid reviews. Sigh!!!!. Finally, I don't know much about TinTin but after seeing this one, Im not that satisfied nor Am i coming out of the theater smiling. And I also don't think Im gonna watch a sequel which is what the end suggests or so. I would have rather watched Rango....."
"chicagopoetry","2","15","38","10 November 2011"," The 99% Want Their Money Back, TInTin
","I just watched TinTin and I couldn't help thinking what a horrible waste of 130 million dollars. Why are the Occupy people protesting Wall Street, when the biggest waste of American dollars is by far coming out of Hollywood. I mean, I guess if you're a fan of TinTin, or if you find some significance in the fact that a mediocre combination of Raiders of the Lost Arc and Pirates of the Caribbean was created in 3D animation, you may find some value in this big dud. But looking at it from my perspective, from someone who when he first saw the poster for this bomb thought it was for a Rin Tin Tin movie, and who has never even heard of TinTin, but beyond that who values movies for their plot, acting and plausibility above all else: this is by far the worst movie of 2011. If Steven Spielberg had bothered to actually make a live action film, he would have had to train a dog to act like it understands the English language, justify how our heroes flew to Africa on fumes burped out of a drunk, create all those big noses and make them look realistic, and actually instruct the actors to act. Now that would have been a good movie. Instead, we get an eagle that has somehow been trained to fetch a particular shred of paper, characters who know they are in danger yet without fail wander off to get whacked on the head and captured and who insist on pointing out the obvious (""Two boats are missing! One of them must have been a decoy!"" --duh). And if you aren't familiar with TinTin forget about it, because this story jumps right into the adventure from moment one without introducing the characters or allowing us to understand their motivations. I said to myself, okay, some red headed kid with a weird haircut is doing all the things I would expect from Indiana Jones--why should I care? And for an animated film, this one isn't exactly for kids. TinTin carries a pistol and uses it, people are tied up and dropped into the ocean to drown, someone tries to shoot someone else with a bazooka, along with various other PG violence. So who is the target audience? It's too silly for adults and too violent for kids. What a waste of 130 million dollars. Blah."

"dbdumonteil","10","6","12","11 November 2011"," The curse of the crimson pirate.
","Since 1947, they have been making movies starring Tintin; the first one was some kind of puppet show based on the ""Crabe Aux Pinces D'Or"", an extract of which was screened some years ago on TV. But the movie itself seemed lost before it reappeared on DVD. Then, in the sixties, there were two movies with actors starring a Tintin lookalike, Jean-Pierre Talbot, but only the first one was entertaining. It was Tintin Et Le Mystère De La Toison D'Or (1961) while Tintin Et Les Oranges Bleues (1964) was a disaster. Then, there were two full feature cartoons: Le Temple Du Soleil (1969) and Tintin Et Le Lac Aux Requins (1972). To be complete, we can mention two series of MTV cartoons, the Belvision ones in the sixties which haven't aged well and the Ellipse ones in the nineties which were faithful to the comic books.<br/><br/>Spielberg's work is the movie the ""Tintinophiles"" have always been waiting for. A cross between Le Crabe Aux Pinces D'Or and Le Secret De La Licorne with a dash of Le Trésor De Rackham Le Rouge thrown in for good measure, plus hints at On A Marché Sur La Lune (bubbles of whiskey) and L'Affaire Tournesol (the Castafiore breaking glass with her voice). The screenplay was carefully worked but begins to falter when Tintin and Captain Haddock are in Morocco. But it regains its strength in the basements of Moulinsart. The opening sequence is a delight: Hergé drawing a sketch of his hero is pure genius. Having replaced Haddock's visions (the bottle of Champagn) by the epics of his ancestor on the Unicorn in the desert is probably the best idea and shows Spielberg's and Jackson's knowledge of psychoanalysis latent in almost all Hergé's work. Turning Sakharine from a harmless collector into the villain was also an asset because it allowed an unexpected connection with the past.<br/><br/>Tintin and Haddock are close to perfect but the Dupondts leave a bit to be desired: their sensational comical power is not fully exploited. And if we appreciate the smart introduction of the ""Milanese Nightingale"", we may regret the absence of professor Tournesol. We hope they save him for the second installment.<br/><br/>No doubt about it: Spielberg and Jackson pulled it off with gusto. Even Milou isn't insignificant as he was in the sixties works. The scene with the sandwich on the ship belongs to him.<br/><br/>""Tintinophile""'s honor: this is superb entertainment. To be precise: this is superb entertainment"

"stuka24","5","4","7","31 January 2012"," Too many chases, not enough substance.
","If you've read Tintin when you were a child, you'll have high standards for an adaptation. Unluckily, even with the best means available, this film disappoints on many levels.<br/><br/>First the plot is nonexistent. If you take away the chases on ship, land, in the city and the desert, you'll get a story that can be told in one paragraph. This is an action movie, with no regard to story.<br/><br/>Secondly, the images themselves are not at all believable. We understand that nowadays every film has to be 3D or perish, but... I'd have preferred something way simpler, like the ""old fashioned"" Disney films of I guess the 60s, like Tom & Jerry, Donald Duck, to Thundercats, Transformers etc. 20 years later.<br/><br/>Tintin is not just a funny hairdo who fights down thugs. He's got a humanistic content that's blatantly absent in this movie. Tintin is intrepid but with the mind, not with his fists.<br/><br/>Captain Haddock is way worse. A constant drunkard, this film is basically Tintin's struggle to get him out of this addiction. And rather repetitive at that.<br/><br/>D. Craig as Rackham is way better, but he's not as central in the books as in this film, that already is selling us a sequel before it ends. The Thomsons are OK, I didn't like ""Snowy"", thought it was too humanized.<br/><br/>""Upcoming"" on IMDb has a great positive review; I'm not glad mine cannot be so positive. ""Ra-gp"" (another user)'s review is right about the technical aspects being fine, like some creative montages. Music by John Williams is of course dutifully fine.<br/><br/>Maybe I was so disappointed because I expected a lot. I don't like motion-capture films like Zemeckis', and I'm afraid this film will win many accolades. Its commercial success doesn't relate to the qualities of the comic book, which just wasn't a cartoon in the American sense of the Spider man, Superman and so on. Summarizing, to put it in PC games' terms, I wanted ""Myst"", a game of mental riddles and beauty, and got ""Counter strike"" with a tint of AA/ addiction's recovery.<br/><br/>Disappointing."
"marzolian","8","4","7","3 January 2012"," Liked very much, but some of it was ""too much""
","It's like nothing I have ever seen before, and that's some of the highest praise that I can give to any piece of art. Most of the time, the characters' faces are almost completely lifelike and yet there's still a hint of their hand-drawn origins. The backgrounds are often entirely believable, but in some scenes they erupt into detail that has simply never been shown on screen before. A fantastic job by the director, the cinematographer, the graphic designers, or whatever all these people's titles are.<br/><br/>There is a downside: several times I turned to my companion and said ""That's too much"". I don't want to be a spoiler but often there was just too much action and too much detail, and a couple of scenes just went on way too long. Occasionally, a scene had me wondering whether it actually shot and then digitally manipulated, or created using motion capture, or created entirely in a computer. But the fact that I was thinking such things meant that I had been distracted; there was so much going on that it had overloaded my brain."

","Tintin couldn't have been put into better hands than that of Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson. Both of them confessed lovers of the boy reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, they knew exactly what to do with what they had and executed it to perfection.<br/><br/>Motion capture is a relatively new creation in the film universe, and here it was used as i hope to see it used further in the future, to bring old favourites back into the limelight and remind everyone why they were loved in the first place. It is the best i've seen yet and is almost photo realistic throughout, the acting too helps this along and works with pretty much perfection. The characters seem believable and while there isn't a load of deeply emotional moments, they still get emotions across clearly and strongly, and you can find you connect with them easily, most importantly they seem real and make you care about them. My one issue is that Daniel Craigs accent seemed to fluctuate a bit and in parts simply not fit the character he is portraying.<br/><br/>It doesn't tread too far from the average treasure hunt movie, it is all focused on the adventure and the relationships between the main characters. But it find a way of being a league above the run of the mill adventure movie. The set pieces within it are stunning and make for some extremely memorable sequences.<br/><br/>The Moffat, Wright, Cornish writing trio, pulled an excellent job of making the film accessible to all audiences, and not resorting to any cheap comedy to maintain the interest, it is a clever sharp script that entertains with complete ease. Even though in my eyes some of the side plots and a couple of separate parts seem a bit under developed and dwindle off into nothing. For example i would have loved to see some more of Thompson and Thomson, as even through the use of motion capture Simon Pegg and Nick Frost have a seamless chemistry between them.<br/><br/>It is a rare moment that i would recommend something to be seen in 3D, but due to the fact this is partly animation in a way, it too works very well, and helps you get immersed into the world you are put in. It only has one cheap use of 3D and i see this as to appeal to the younger audiences seeing it, other than that it is used to layer the environment very well and just makes it seem that step more real.<br/><br/>Other than a few niggles, this film just goes to show what the masters of cinema can do with the technology around and something they love. With Jackson already confirming he's directing Tintin 2, and Spielberg most likely producing, i'll be first in line to see it, and i would put money on me being the first if we're lucky enough to be treated to a third installment as the plan is currently. As long as they keep the formula they did with this film, i can't see that changing anytime soon. Roll on 2 and 3."

I don't care how good the film looks, it was just filled with unfunny humour and exposition. My two stars are for the animation alone. It also had John Williams' worst score for a film - I had the feeling he couldn't have cared less about it. The poor script writing is what makes this film interminably dull - and we can thank Steven Moffat for that. Anyone who's ever watched Doctor Who will know that Moffat loves his exposition. He just can't help but get characters waffle on about what's happening in the film, and what will happen if they don't stop the bad guy etc etc. The whole film felt like an ordeal that had to be overcome.

"davidgkimberley","5","5","10","26 November 2011"," Spielberg has spoilt Tintin
","I went into this film expecting the worst but hoping for the best, as an avid Tintin fan as a kid I always kind of felt, and now feel, that he should be left in his original form and not tampered with. Firstly, a lot of people have complained about really basic things like the voices, cinematography or music. None of that stuff really bothered me, I actually thought the voices were pretty good (apart from perhaps Thomson & Thompson) adaptations, people are always going to have had created their own imaginary voices for the characters but I think this was done well and pleased most people. The cinematography was pretty decent, though it felt very inappropriately Indiana Jones-esc in the last quarter, and the music was absolutely fine - I don't think Tintin really needs an Indie like score, it wouldn't really work.<br/><br/>Several things, however, really REALLY bugged me. Firstly; the film is supposed to be a combination of three books (The Secret of The Unicorn, The Crab With the Golden Claws and Red Rackham's treasure) but I just didn't see the point in that at all. The bits in the film which are good are the bits which are just direct copies of Herge and I just don't see why Spielberg couldn't have just followed exactly a book, or two books, especially given that any of the books is effectively a storyboard and script in itself. All that happens as a result of this is a wobbly first half of the film, which isn't that bad, and then a really really crappy second half, that utterly misses the original books - the Bird Brothers aren't mentioned once and the main 'baddy' is someone, who in the Secret of The Unicorn, plays a very very minor role. There's two action scenes which are both straight out of Indiana Jones but that, at least, for me is the complete opposite of what Tintin is supposed to be - he's supposed to be a very precise, intelligent, cunning character not a loud Hollywood directed moron who blows everything up. There is also an extremely clichéd ""never give up, never let anyone tell you blah blah blah blah"" type speech from Haddock to Tintin that's just awful; firstly because he could easily have not put it in and more importantly because that, again, is not what Tintin is about and it never happens in any of the books. <br/><br/>All of those things, and other minor details, just make the film feel really unpolished, as though it was a real lacklustre effort that went into making it and at its best its completely average. This actually made me really angry, Tintin is a legendary character who deserves the utmost respect and that just wasn't given to him at all. What is more I just don't get why Spielberg felt the need to warp the story in the way that he did because it ruined it completely. Most importantly though, I fear Tintin could really be mutilated for a new generation of readers, I would bet that most kids going to see this film (and Tintin is, as much as I love it, for kids!) haven't read any of the books and they've been given this completely false image of a really amazing, fun character. Go and see it, because you kind of have to, but prepare to be let down really badly."

","I read a few reviews of this movie before taking my 8 and 6 year old nieces to see it - an adventure tale about a kid detective and his dog! Based upon the popular children's' comic! I read many headlines such as these, and then I almost took my nieces out of the theatre because the film had so much adult content. To summarize some things about this film, the ""kid"" detective carries a gun, a man is shot and killed within the first 20 minutes, and one of the main plot points is that one of the characters is always drunk. Kids see way too much violence in our media nowadays, what happened to funny, interesting, kid-centric PG movies? Shame on Spielberg for making a ""children's"" film with so much violence and adult topics. Also, because it's animated it seems that it's for children, but it's most definitely not. This should be rated PG13, DO NOT take your young children to see it."

","I think most of the people seemed to await the Tintin movie with mixed feelings since except of the (horrible) french movies from 1964 and the really great cartoons (1991-1992) nobody really dared to touch the great work of Herge. I as well had mixed feelings when I went to watch it since I grew up reading the comic books and watching the cartoons, which in my view still are unmatched since they were created with Herge himself included in the process of drawing them. Anyways, it was exciting to hear that Steven Spielberg ( whom Herge by the way called the only one being able to make a movie out of his work ) and Peter Jackson were working together making a movie out of a beloved childhood memory. Many people were put off by the fact by the look of Tintin or the fact that they used different comic books and made a new story out of it, which is understandable. But once you have seen the movie it does not matter anymore because the spirit and the love, which Herge put in his characters can be felt strongly while watching it.<br/><br/>Talking about the story, as I mentioned before the movie is a mix between different comic books. But the main part still is out of "" The secret of the unicorn"". It was surprising to see how they managed to stay that close to the comic book even tough they mixed in other parts and added some new features. In the comic book the evil guy Sakkharin is a harmless elderly guy and the conspiracy about the Unicorns Treasure has nothing to do with him, except that he is a collector and Tintin mistakes him for a robber. Also, Tintin already knows Captain Haddock out of ""The crab with the golden claws"" in the original comic book. In the movie they decided to make them meet exactly the way as they did in ""The crab with the golden claws"". Luckily they also threw in some of the main villains of that book, like the first mate Alan. It might sound a bit confusing while reading, but in the movie it all makes perfect sense. Since I am a big fan of the comic books I was really critical in the first 30 minutes of the movie but the way they captured the spirit of the books made me forget about it really quick, I can not say that enough. To make an example, every figure they took out of the books has exactly the same clothes as Herge drew them, that is attention to details! The characters are obviously great! Tintin is captured pretty well, even tough many complained about the way he looks. The problem here is that, even in the comic books he does not have any facial features at all. For instance Captain Haddock, Thompson and Thompson, Nestor all these characters have really specific facial features like beards, glasses etc. But with Tintin it is different in the comic books, his face is kind of plain and only his red cheeks and his hair is what makes him look special! So in my view, they did a good job with that! Toby Bell's voice acting is decent but he probably could not show off a lot since Tintin is not really talking that much in the movie. One thing is for sure, Andy Serkis was the best choice they could have made for Captain Haddock. He is absolutely amazing! He is funny, he is swearing exactly like in the comic books and he just has you in his ban the second he starts talking in his amazing Scottish accent. The only flaw with him is that they overdid his drinking problem a bit. In the comic books it is not as bad as it was displayed in the movie. The comic book Haddock likes drinking and occasionally gets drunk, the alcohol problem is shown in a subtle way, but movie Haddock is a alcoholic. Maybe they wanted to make it educational? But this is just a minor flaw in an otherwise great character! Nevertheless, with the main villain there are some problems as well.. I just do not get it why they chose Sakkharin... in the comic books he plays a minor role and they had a choice of many many great classic villains: Rastapopoulos, Dr. Mueller and more.... At least Haddock's first mate Alan is in the movie, but he is just not important to the story, whereas in the comic books he plays a major role. I understand that they could not have made him the main villain since he is only a thug of Rastapopoulos in the comic books but he would have been better than Sakkharin. Anyways, Daniel Craig's voice acting is good, but still the movie lacks in having a great main villain.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is surprisingly good!. Nevertheless, Tintin and The secret of the Unicorn has some minor flaws and I still do prefer the cartoon series from 1991-1992 but there are many references to the cartoons and the books that make you forget about all that while watching the movie. For instance they break through the wall exactly as in the comic books, Haddock does kick a whiskey bottle exactly as in the comic books and the characters look mostly exact like in the comic books. ( Sakkharin, Haddock, the flea market salesman, Alan ( amazing ), Tintin's housekeeper... I am getting distracted here ) I find it amazing that Herge has a small role in the beginning of the movie where he asks Tintin if he has already drawn him before and Tintin answers: Occasionally. ( You might discover some Herge character portraits in the background ). Now I am really getting into the details so I might as well wrap this up: Great movie, great fun if you liked the comic books you are gonna love it!"

","The Adventures of Tintin is a great adventure movie for kids and probably for anyone who read the Tintin comics as a child. I only had maybe two or three of the comic books when I was young, so I was not expecting too much.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is absolutely impressive. The characters, hair, skins and clothes look so realistic it's almost scary. But because the faces are straight from the comics, it never drifts off to uncanny valley.<br/><br/>The story itself is supposed to be taken from three of the books and is nice to watch, but not too exciting. It is remarkable, though, how many guns and shooting is displayed in a Spielberg movie.<br/><br/>I saw this in IMAX 3D and while the sound was impressive, the 3D effect is not too eye-catching, except for a few specially-for-3D moments. The 2D Blu-ray Disc will surely be a great demo disc.<br/><br/>All in all I was glad that I won the tickets to the presentation, especially in consideration of todays 3D ticket prices. The ending was a bit of a letdown and came too soon after the big ""boss fight"" shortly before the end."
"robipatr","9","3","5","2 September 2017"," Severely Underrated
","The Adventures of Tintin is an Indiana Jones-type adventure, spanning across the globe, with likable characters, and a cunning villain, voiced by Daniel Craig. The animation is fantastic, and it really helps you feel like you're part of the action. My favourite scene is when Captain Haddock (played by Andy Serkis) has a flashback to his pirate ancestor, fighting off intruders. My one criticism is when Captain Haddock fights the villain. With a crane. A crane sword fight. It's fun to watch but it's so unbelievable. <br/><br/>A movie that should be brought up more. 8/10"
"bdgill12","7","3","5","1 January 2012"," Light on plot but heavy on excitement; the animated Indiana Jones
","I'd like to believe that everyone agrees in the following sentiment: the fourth Indiana Jones film is terrible. (Well, everyone except George Lucas.) Even Steven Spielberg seems to understand the train wreck he put on screen in 2008, though he won't come out and say that in order to protect Lucas. That movie stands as one of the worst experiences of my cinematic life, a slap in the face of Phantom Menace proportions. But after having seen The Adventures of Tintin, I feel a little bit better. And I move that we officially strike Kingdom of the Crystal Skull from the record and name Tintin the fourth Indy film. Seconded?<br/><br/>Tintin (voice by Jamie Bell) is a young journalist with a knack for breaking major stories. When he comes across a model of a man-o-war ship known as The Unicorn, he senses a story and begins digging around into the history of the ship and its cargo. Soon he finds himself caught up in the midst of a generations-old battle between two seafaring families, the Haddocks and the Rackhams. After joining forces with Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), the last of his line who keeps an important secret buried beneath years of alcoholism, Tintin and his dog Snowy undertake a globetrotting trek to foil the plans of Sakharine (Daniel Craig), who wants to steal the Haddock birthright.<br/><br/>There aren't a lot of animated movies that qualify as true adventure flicks but Tintin is one of them. From the dynamic opening credits until the conclusion, the film runs at full sprint, rarely stopping to take a breath. It is the very definition of a thrill ride as Tintin and his pals find themselves in one dangerous situation after another. At times it plays out like a video game, jumping from one level (as it were) to the next but in this case, I think that fits the story well. This is sheer fun and exhilaration and the quick shifts in setting and plot should make it easy for kiddos to follow along while parents dig into the Spielbergian adventure.<br/><br/>The characters within Tintin are strong if somewhat limited. Tintin himself is kind of a baby-faced Jack Bauer, a master of all trades from shooting guns to flying planes who always manages to stay one step ahead of his opponents. Haddock provides outstanding comedic relief and a touch of brute force to back Tintin's brains. In fact, I think the film takes off when Haddock shows up. His presence provides a second gear to Tintin and his relative buffoonery allows for fun and outlandish plot points that keep the ball rolling. All of this begs the question: has any actor ever had a better year without actually appearing in person on camera than Andy Serkis has this year? He's THE reason why Rise of the Planet of the Apes worked and he is easily the best part of this film in my book. If Tintin doesn't quite measure up to Indy, Haddock is a better Sallah than John Rhys Davies ever was (heretical statement, I know). And while Sakharine isn't exactly a pre-war Nazi, his power grows throughout the movie and he becomes a suitable villain.<br/><br/>The only real complaint I might voice about Tintin is the paper-thin plot. While the video game-like feel works overall, there are times when I might have preferred some exposition. There are a few interconnecting story lines that serve to advance the narrative and that's good because there isn't a whole lot of time devoted to character or plot development. Even still, at times it comes across as if the plot was picked out of a list of creative writing prompts, though the way Spielberg dives into said prompt is often deliciously entertaining. In addition, Tintin is to motion capture animation what Avatar was to 3D: it is the exception not the rule, the example of what the technology is capable of delivering in the right hands. Robert Zemeckis bankrupted a company trying to master the art of motion capture but in my mind, he never came close to achieving what Spielberg does here. Tintin is an absolutely gorgeous film that thrives on beautiful landscapes and exquisite details. Tintin may be light one plot but it is heavy on excitement and the visuals serve to deepen the experience, making this one of the more enjoyable films of the year.<br/><br/>Please check out my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com and ieatfilms.com"
"Chickenwafflefilm","10","3","5","30 December 2011"," Movie Of The Year
","Steven Spielberg, you have done it again. This is his latest movie (and his first animated one at that) based on the classic Tintin comics created by Herge. Despite the fact that this is his first animated film, Spielberg does not disappoint and actually delivers a fantastic movie. Now, where did the idea for the making of this film start? Mr. Spielberg of course. What's interesting is that he wanted to make it a live action film. So he contacted Peter Jackson of Weta Digital to produce a ""CGI"" Snowy (Tintin's dog). Jackson's reply? That live action wouldn't do it justice. So, the outcome was a motion capture film. Real actors, really acting; covered in a layer of the most realistic animation out there. From Morocco's streets to Captain Haddock's nose hair, the detail is so great that it makes you think: ""Why would they want to make it animated if they bothered with the little things? Why not get real actors?"". Why? Ill tell you why. Because when using animation, you get the real look of the characters without murdering them, without complaints from people that this actor would have been better, or looked more like this character and all that. Now, the movie's plot is taken from three of the original comics. ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", and Red Rackham's Treasure"". The story is fantastic. The cast as well. Now, I'm sure Andy Serkis is going to be in every motion-capture film till the end of his days. Let's see the accomplishment: King Kong- did the real screaming and growling for King Kong; Lord of the Rings-people insisted Serkis be nominated as best actor even though the role was done with motion-capture; Rise of the Planet of the Apes; fantastic job as Caesar; Captain Haddock-full of life, extravagant, one of a kind character. I'm a big fan. Now, people are saying that the movie didn't do the comics justice. I for one, think it did. Sure they weren't ""COMPLETELY"" faithful to the comics in a sense that they merged different comics and all that. But you see, that's the problem with people! They are huge fans of lets say, a comic book. And when they watch the movie, they get angry because they didn't follow every tiny detail. The director and his crew need their artistic freedom! Keeping only the essential and key elements. That's what they did here, and it worked. <br/><br/>Directing: Steven Spielberg is great when filming live action. He's much better when it comes to animated films! The way he interpreted the scenes and especially the scene where ******* ******* makes a transition between himself and *** ******* *******. It is fantastic, well played and i cant praise it enough.<br/><br/>Effects: Take the most realistic animation you have ever seen while staying just short of the border between animation and reality and multiply that by a million. The result? ""The Adventures of Tintin""<br/><br/>Acting: Superb. No exaggeration here. It was great. Especially...wait for it... Andy Serkis.<br/><br/>Over-all: This may be a bold statement. To me, this is the movie of the year. Nothing i say can express my feelings for this movie. It's a big ball of freaking' awesomeness, and you need to see it. ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"" is the definition of a great movie."

","My review is in a simplified format - avoiding all the waffle, idiosyncrasies and ego massaging.<br/><br/>Visually outstanding and faithful to original books. The narrative is not really in the spirit of the original works though, because the movie is overwhelmed with action set-pieces and only tentatively embraces the Arthur Conan-Doyle/ Agatha Christie-type action-mystery genre. Overly-elaborate fight scenes, including swordplay using cranes. Too much of 'I thought I'd already killed you.' and Mwahahahaha...

","After missing the special Director's preview this past Thursday i finally got the chance to see it last night with my friend who was not actually willing to go for this flick simply because he is a huge Bollywood movies fan. But as i was planning to see this movie since the teasers started on the you tube & unable to find a ticket for a Bollywood movie which was sold out even for the next morning show i eventually wound up to buy tickets for TINTIN.<br/><br/>Now straight to business.. the movie i saw was in 3D so i liked the technical part & special effects. This movie has some very great 3D effects we all have seen since AVATAR. i was clearly hearing the cheers from crowds & a couple sitting right next to me who were every now & then making a wow! sound. i liked the detailed background picture sequences & every things was so realistic that it does justice with its 3D aspect so i am giving 10/10 on the technical parts including sound effects also.<br/><br/>Now comes the screenplay. Well it can be a 50:50 argument that many people who had been a loyal fan of TINTIN era might find the accounts of the story or the thriller level not up to the mark..but i beg to differ here. I have seen the old Tintin animations and i did not kinda enjoyed them simply because it was so simple i mean no fancy artwork & story was just relied totally on twists & breakneck speed events...but i gotta tell you i loved this movie not because of the story or the amount of the action but the way it has added the technology to represent the right spirit of a TINTIN ADVENTURE. I always wished that a Tintin series should be modified for the taste of our younger generation so that this Gem in the comics industry can regain the place which rightfully belongs to it. So the Director has nicely kept the pace alive during the whole movie & no one felt dull for a moment in the cinema hall so the credit goes to the director & script writers.<br/><br/>Also movie has lots of funny moments which helps the audience to connect with the story in a much positive manner who has not been aware of the TINTIN character especially in Asian subcontinent. While every body coming out of the Cinema hall i remember had a smile on their faces & an expression of satisfaction that they have viewed a fine piece of cinema; so thanks to Steven Spielberg who not only believed in the possibilities of this project but also decided to finance it completely. and his ability to turn simple projects in to a blockbuster can be seen here once again.<br/><br/>SO overall i liked this movie very much..i would also tell you that this is my first animation movie which i have seen inside a Cinema hall..simply because i used to believe that an animation cannot be more entertaining then real actor's performance but i think i need to revisit my old belief.<br/><br/>i thoroughly enjoyed the movie so my rating is 10/10.<br/><br/>Catch it you won't be disappointed..tell your friends & family to see it & don't wait for a pirated copy because some things in life are worth spending money."
"Diptoman","6","4","8","11 November 2011"," From a Tintin fan who had been waiting for this film the whole year: Kind of disappointing, and below my expectations...
","I'll be honest here, I'm a big fan of Tintin, having read all of the comic books, and this was one film I was looking forward to the whole year. But sadly, it was kind of a letdown.<br/><br/>Supposedly based on ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"", the film follows none of the story lines and instead creates a new story with a brand new villain, Ivanovich Sakharine, who wasn't really a villain in the original ""The Secrets of the Unicorn"". Minor deviations from the main plot can be overlooked, but seriously... this? <br/><br/>...And the story continues, mixing the settings and scenes from all the three comics, mainly during the action sequences. This new plot seemed very much forced and lacking the natural flow of the actual story. For those who've read the books, the base story used here is from ""The Secrets of the Unicorn"" in settings from ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", with the ending from ""Red Rackham's Treasure"". There was too much random shooting and blasting (in short, action), and too less stealth and humor for a Tintin story in the film. Was this staying faithful to Herge's Tintin? I'd say no.<br/><br/>Now, as for the character representations, I felt Tintin's role was given justice, while Haddock's definitely wasn't. Haddock is famous for his antics and his language use, and that wasn't quite captured well at all. He even gave serious advice at one point! Sure, some of his actions invoked laughter, but I expected much more! Occasional humor was also provided by Thomson and Thompson, and I enjoyed them thoroughly. Sakharine excelled as a villain as well. However Allan, though in the actual story was quite a character himself, was reduced to a mere order following thug in the film. Bianca Castafiore, who wasn't there in ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"", made an appearance in the film, but Professor Calculus, who made his first appearance and was an integral part of ""Red Rackham's Treasure"", wasn't in the film!<br/><br/>Though the story hardly followed ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" at any time, the ending did. Any sequel of this film would have to completely divert from the original story as well, because in the comic, Tintin and Haddock found the treasure after a failed search in the ocean, while in the film, they found the treasure first and then found directions for more.<br/><br/>In short, I'm unhappy because the story of the film didn't follow the actual story, which could've been excused had the story of the film been an entirely new one with a good plot (such as in, say, ""Sherlock Holmes""), but it wasn't, and it used parts from the original stories to create a very linear but nevertheless jumbled-up plot, which didn't appeal to me much.<br/><br/>Well, that's enough of looking at the negatives, there are a lot of positive aspects to the film as well. For a start, the animation (using motion capture technology) and visual effects were mind blowing, spellbinding, and very awe-freaking-some, and this is probably the best visual treat of this year. Attention to detail was amazing, and it was often easy to forget that I was watching an animated film. The soundtrack was very fitting and blended with the atmosphere very nicely.<br/><br/>I saw some people criticizing the film because it didn't give any introduction to Tintin, and that he's too lackluster as a character and all that, but I'd like to give the film credit for portraying Tintin's character like that, because he essentially was in the comic books as well. Tintin is a reporter and gets into trouble wherever he goes, and that's all we need to know to enjoy the stories.<br/><br/>Overall, this film could be fun for Tintin first timers, but for a veteran like me, it wasn't. It failed to give me any nostalgic feelings, but on the other hand, the stunning animation and special effects partly managed to counter those deficits. I wouldn't discourage anyone from viewing it, but I wouldn't encourage it either."

When I was kid I was a big fan of Tintin, so I knew all the comics, and I had read them a billion times. I knew that they would let Calculus out of the story, this was weird, because he is one of the key characters of that story, but how they solved this was really clever. It was really fun to watch this movie, and I would like to see it again soon, and I don't have that with a lot of movies.<br/><br/>this is a movie recommended for real Tintin fans, but also for the people who doesn't know Tintin."
"lcastilla","Null","6","14","3 November 2011"," a boring movie about a great comic book
","As an avid reader of Tintin comics(in fact of all high quality comics), I was terribly disappointed by this movie. Nice graphics but a terribly boring story line. The film will bore, I believe, those of us over 55. There are so many other Tin Tin stories the producers could have used for the first Tin Tin film. But no!, they had to use this ""three ship story line"", with a captain Haddock as an incredibly foolish drunkard. The movie is much too long, boring and childish. Yet it is perhaps worth watching on a home video where you can stop it while you get a snack, or cut it in half to see the second half some other day, but certainly not worth sitting down in a movie theater for almost two grueling hours.Sorry Spielberg, I loved all your other films!!"
"jmhoggard","8","6","14","25 October 2011"," A splendid attempt to capture the magic of Tintin
","When I was a child, I devoured the Tintin stories, I used to visit the library every week and take out as many as I was allowed - over and over again.<br/><br/>So I was worried, despite the names of the Director and Producer, that this wouldn't quite capture the joy of my youth (I'm now 40).<br/><br/>However, I had nothing to fear - and despite being an amalgamation of several Tintin stories I think it flows rather well with more than enough set pieces to fill a film.<br/><br/>The relationship between Tintin and Snowy and Tintin and Haddock work really well and having read some of the other reviews it annoys me somewhat that the other reviewers say ""voiced by"" - that does a great disservice to the actors involved - in particular Serkis (Gollum, King Kong) as Haddock. ""Performance Capture"" (ala Avatar) really does capture the nuances of the actors performance - Serkis really is Haddock - he fills the character and at times the screen and scene.<br/><br/>I think only Thompson and Thomson let this aspect down - I love Pegg and Frost, but were they right to play the bumbling Twins? Possibly not.<br/><br/>From a computer-geek point of view - the 3D is good, but I won't miss it when I buy this on standard Blu-Ray when it comes out and there were times when I forgot I was watching a computer generated scene - the level of detail on skin, hair, clothing is truly staggering.<br/><br/>Indeed Spielberg makes good use of the technology to create sweeping camera shots that pass through glass and water that would be impossible had this been a live action film.<br/><br/>Finally, for me the most telling tribute to this film, is that I took my ten and four year old daughters, who have no history with Tintin at all, to see it and they absolutely loved it - they giggled and whooped and gasped at all the places I think they were supposed to.<br/><br/>If you have no history with Tintin then you should enjoy this as a feel-good, family, rip-roaring adventure and if you're a die-hard Tintin lover, I suggest you leave your baggage at the door otherwise you will disappointed, because how could you be anything else?"
"dalelawson-1","5","5","11","27 October 2011"," The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn Review
","After hyping myself up for The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn last night I went into the film with high hopes, as I enjoyed the old cartoon series. I won't say I was disappointed but it didn't meet my expectations. <br/><br/>The most disappointing part for me was the soundtrack. Whenever the tempo began to increase, it would then just drop never quite achieving an emotional response from me. When the rest of the film resembles classics like the Indiana Jones trilogy, it is understandable why the audio track let me down. <br/><br/>The plot was very similar to the cartoon episodes, The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Secret of the Unicorn, which the film was based on. For obvious reasons these episodes had to be combined so for the film to flow properly. As is any movie based on a TV show, comic or book; there are also many scenes that have been cut and plenty of new scenes and stories added for the plot to make a little more sense. But like I said, a large number of movie adaptations do this and so I won't dwell on the altered plot too long. <br/><br/>Soundtrack, and plot, aside this film was still enjoyable to watch; perhaps even more so I you're a child watching for the very first time. The aspect of the film that made it so enjoyable was not the plot, soundtrack or even visuals, which were as fantastic as expected thanks to the technology of motion capture. But the characters themselves are what made this film. Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) was fantastic, we saw him angry, loyal, worried and most importantly drunk. They stuck very close to his character from the cartoons, and comics, as you'd hope Spielberg would. Jamie Bell, or Billy Elliot as may of us know him, gave us the character of Tintin. Unfortunately Tintin was a little emotionless throughout the film and the voice acting wasn't perfect, but even this is easily forgotten when Inspector Thompson (Simon Pegg) and Inspector Thomson (Nick Frost) are on the screen. These two characters are as precise to the comics and cartoons as they could be. When they are on screen the audience cannot help but have a grin on their face and laugh at the simplest of slapstick comedy. But to say that they are the highlight of the film puts Daniel Craig to shame. As Daniel Craig is well known for Bond I, and others, often criticise his acting ability. But when he provides such a slimy villain as Sakharine I am forced but to give him credit for his acting. Absolutely nothing about this character resembles Craig in anyway; be it look, motion or sound. Craig has done an improbable job providing The Adventures of Tintin with a dastardly villain. <br/><br/>Finally I have to write a brief note about the look of the film. Now it doesn't look like the Tintin comics or cartoon (i.e. Hand-drawn) but I had never expected it to in this day and age. The characters all look like the cartoon version of themselves but 3D computer models instead. Thompson and Thomson have to be once again referenced as they look as similar to their cartoon counterparts as they possibly could do, whereas Tintin seems a little too lifelike in this world of big nosed, squinty eyed characters. The motion capture animation makes the film very lifelike and is likely to be the future for all forms of animation eventually. <br/><br/>To summarise this film, although it doesn't meet all expectations, it is still very much a Tintin movie. We get the enjoyable relationship of the two protagonists (and snowy), as well as the slapstick, comedic breaks of Thompson and Thomson, and the villainous Sakharine. The film feels like a children's Indiana Jones movie, as one would expect and it is only let down by an unfulfilling soundtrack and a slightly predictable plot. All in all The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is well worth a watch, if not just for the nostalgia.<br/><br/>http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/"

","Though not a movie I would usually be drawn too (it looked a bit unabashedly ""kiddie"" for my tastes), it came highly recommend from a family member obsessed with Spielberg filmmaking. I gave it a try and, while it won't top any of my ""best-of"" lists, it did provide a great deal of adventure, drama, action, and humor, pleasantly surprising me in the process.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Adventures of Tintin"" focuses on the young Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell), a kind of Indiana Jones-type adventurer along with trusty sidekick dog Snowy. When young Tintin buys a model ship at an auction one day, he is suddenly thrust into a race for treasure involving a drunken sea captain (voice of Andy Serkis) and his nefarious foe (voice of Daniel Craig).<br/><br/>I would say that the long-lasting effects of this film will be two-fold:<br/><br/>First, I would still categorize it as very much a children's movie. It could probably best be described as ""Indiana Jones for the elementary set"" in terms of its combination of all genre elements. Had I first viewed this film as a child, I know that I would have watched it again and again! For adults, of course, it also functions as escapism.<br/><br/>Also, the somewhat controversial animation (is this middle ground needed between reality and Pixar-like animation?) is truly a sight to behold. I honestly am not any sort of expert on the subject and thus have no predictions for the future of the format, but the visuals are as top- notch as anything you'll see anywhere else. It is just...different.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Adventures of Tintin"" just seems like Spielberg's childhood epic. Perhaps the film can be appreciated even more if one has read the comic novel stories it is based on (I didn't even know about this until after the viewing!). On the whole, though, a very entertaining flick that makes for great family viewing."

","As an avid reader n collector of the Tintin comic books and a fan of the television show, i thoroughly njoyd this awesome flick. Fans of the original comic books will be happy to see a faithful adaptation of the books, and fans of Spielberg's Indiana Jones' series will be more than impressed with the action sequences. The animation is simply breath-taking and astonishingly lifelike for the most part. Once again i wanna state that the animation is one of the most beautiful I've ever seen. It's not right to call it a CGI film as the motion of the characters are much smoother than that of CGI films. All of the animation is simply breathtaking and the best I've ever seen. The action and especially the chase sequence was awesome. The film is gorgeous, and probably the best motion-capture rendering to date. The colors pop, the 3D is adequate, and the characters and settings are so lifelike they sometimes looked real. Simply put: a visual feast. Me n my kids had a good time in the theatre."
"Lejink","6","2","3","16 March 2015"," Tintin out
","As a young teenager I avidly borrowed as many of the Tintin comic books from my library as I possibly could and indeed many years later as an adult, bought them all to have them permanently. I was therefore more than curious to see what Steven Spielberg would do with the character, with this, the first big-time movie feature of the young Belgian reporter and his faithful dog Snowy.<br/><br/>I really appreciated the title sequence with the lettering in the original style of the books but must admit that afterwards I found it difficult to completely accept the motion-capture technique employed. I guess it's a similar criticism which was levelled at say ""The Polar Express"", where the characters depicted are more human than cartoon, putting at odds somewhat the toon-town type various stunts and action sequences which occur to almost-human looking characters.<br/><br/>I also felt that there just too many of these big set-pieces which gave me battle-fatigue in the end. There's no shortage of ingenuity or spectacle in some of these scenes but coming in rapid succession as they do, they got a bit too commonplace in my view. Characterisation not unnaturally is shallow and distinctly one-dimensional while the story is relentlessly episodic. When Tintin and / or Captain Haddock miraculously escapes death for the umpteenth time, it takes a little of the suspense away for what comes next.<br/><br/>Of course it's difficult to comment on the acting given it's all done in the animation and to be honest I barely noticed the big-name voice actors employed. I wasn't impressed by the super-confident reference at the end to a sequel which four years after first release still noticeably hasn't seen the light of day.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, quite a lot of the movie I did like and there were some spectacular directorial flourishes to enjoy, none more than when a handshake between Tintin and the Captain dissolves into a landscape. Still, I found it on the whole a bit too loud and crash-bang-wallop for my tastes, so that the characters were almost overpowered by the action raging around them. <br/><br/>Would Herge have approved? I'm not so sure, this looks a wee bit like one of those vanity projects big-name directors can indulge themselves in without completely taking their audience along with them."

","Paramount Pictures now offers you on DVD and Blu-ray last year's theatrical hit, The Adventures of Tintin. Racking up an impressive list of award nominations, including an Oscar for the music, the film took home the International Animated Film Association's Annie Award for Animated Effects in an Animated Production. The characters, although animation, look more like real people than cartoon. In fact, twelve-year-old KIDS FIRST! youth film critic Brianna Beaton says, ""I almost forget that I am watching an animated film, and several times I get lost in the moment and think it's real life.""<br/><br/>See Brianna's full review on video.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsaNqmAYnzQ<br/><br/>This is a great animated film! I absolutely love it. The Adventures of Tintin has lots of action and mystery, and will keep you on the edge of your seat. I almost forget that I am watching an animated film, and several times I get lost in the moment and think it's real life. I like Snowy, Tintin's dog, because he is very loyal and will go anywhere with Master. <br/><br/>The fearless reporter, Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell), and Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis) set off on an adventure, hunting for a sunken ship, the Unicorn, which had been commanded by Haddock's ancestor. Trying to find three scrolls, which contain clues to where the treasure is hidden, Tintin and his new friend, the Captain, become closer and closer friends as they get deeper and deeper into their adventure. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg (War Horse) directs this outstanding film and reminds me there is a little kid in all of us. This film sends a great message that sometimes you just need someone to rely on when going through your own adventure. <br/><br/>I recommend this film for ages 8 to 13. And because of all the suspense and tons of action it has, I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. The Adventures of Tintin is truly a great treasure and a must-see, so get your copy on DVD or Blu-ray and enjoy the adventure!"
"Rectangular_businessman","9","2","3","6 January 2012"," A pleasant surprise
","When I was a kid, I used to watch the ""The Adventures of Tintin"" animated series from 1991: That series was my first contact with the all the stories and characters created by Hergé. Even when I never became a ""Tintin"" fan (At least, not a die-hard fan) I always found that series to be funny and interesting, being a faithful adaptation of the original books. <br/><br/>When this movie was announced, I had some doubts about it, because I heard that it was going to be made using motion-capture animation. While that visual technique works very well for video-games, it didn't have very good results in animated films (Just like in the last three movies made by Robert Zemeckis, and in the atrocious film ""Mars Needs Moms"") <br/><br/>Fortunately, ""Tintin"" ended being a much better movie than I was expecting: Not only the quality of the animation is vastly superior to feature films such as ""Beowulf"" of ""The Polar Express"", having an incredible level of realism (Despite the fact that there is still something a bit awkward about the movements and expression of the characters.) But the best thing about this film is that it respects the true essence of the source material, being an exciting adventure flick from beginning to end. Just like the original Hergé comics, or the animated series from 1991. The action scenes were excellent, having all the Steven Spielberg ""touch"" in all of them, being incredibly faithful to the books in which this film is based.<br/><br/>""The Adventures of Tintin"", along with ""Rango"" and ""Kung Fu Panda 2"" is one of the best movies from the year 2011, and for me, it was one of the most enjoyable flicks that I have the chance to see in the last year. Even when I don't like motion-capture animation, I found this movie to quite entertaining and enjoyable. I highly recommend it for the whole family."
"supernma","9","2","3","31 December 2011"," Non-Stop Fun Makes ""Tin-Tin"" a Winner
","I'll first admit that I knew very little about Tin Tin going in, and have never read any of the stories - therefore, I am reviewing this strictly as a standalone film and not as an adaptation.<br/><br/>Spielberg's latest (aside from ""War Horse"") is nothing but carefree fun and excitement from start to finish, never waning or dragging its feet - a true roller-coaster ride. The film is basically a series of clues leading to a series of chases and cliffhangers, all perfectly laced with moments of humor and whimsy, making for a concoction that both children and adults can enjoy. The mystery itself is not all that interesting, but it is told with such vigor and spectacle that you don't really notice or care (and if you do, you're watching it for the wrong reasons). The film is simply meant to entertain - as pure as adventure can get, and nobody knows how to film an adventure story quite like Steven Spielberg. His trademark uses of lighting and clever transitions are all present, and the look and feel of the film all has a familiar tone (reminiscent of the Indiana Jones films most obviously).<br/><br/>As far as looks are concerned, the film is gorgeous, and probably the best motion-capture rendering to date (in that the entire film is motion-captured; I am not comparing this to ""Avatar""). The colors pop, the 3D is adequate, and the characters and settings are so lifelike they sometimes looked real - I never saw any of the infamous soullessness that the motion-capture method has become stigmatized with. Simply put: a visual feast. The actors do a great job as well, delivering their lines with gusto and an optimistic innocence missing from most films today; the artists did a fantastic job capturing their subtleties and mannerisms.<br/><br/>John Williams also delivers a suitable, spirited score (although not particularly original: a blend of ""Catch Me If You Can"" and the Indiana Jones theme).<br/><br/>Overall, the film was a blast - a good old fashioned adventure romp with no real consequences or depth, but simple and pure. Some have labeled it as forgettable, which I couldn't disagree more. As I said earlier, the story itself is not particularly gripping, but the style in which it is told paired with the impressive animation and thrilling, roller-coaster-like action set pieces is what makes ""Tin-Tin"" something I could watch over and over again.<br/><br/>If I did not address issues other reviewers have highlighted, that is because I do not find fault in them. If you can't have fun at this film then you've lost, as Tin-Tin would say, your thirst for adventure."
"tavm","7","2","3","31 December 2011"," Steven Spielberg does justice to Herge's creation with The Adventures of Tintin
","When I was a kid during the late '70s, I was familiar with a magazine called ""Children's Digest"". During that time, the publication had inside its monthly pages a serialized comic that featured a boyish hero named Tintin of which the first I had read was the middle part of ""The Secret of the Unicorn"". That story would continue the following year as ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" of which I managed to read all the way through. And so it is about four decades later that having remembered those adventures, I decided to go with my movie theatre-working friend to watch Steven Spielberg's motion capture version of this adaptation of Belgian cartoonist Herge's creation. It had the great sense of humor and entertaining action sequences one would expect from the director of the Indiana Jones spectacles and while the last action set-piece may have been one too many, it wasn't a complete waste of time. And seeing characters like Tintin, his dog Snowy, Captain Haddock, and the comic relief detectives of Thompson and Thomson brought a big smile to my face in the way they were depicted. Also kudos to frequent Spielberg collaborator John Williams for providing another entertaining music score (though it's not as memorable as his classic ones for Jaws, the original '77 Star Wars, E.T., and the aforementioned Raiders, that's for sure). Really, Spielberg's done it again! So on that note, The Adventures of Tintin is highly recommended."
"jacob_enriquez","9","2","3","31 December 2011"," True to the comic books
","I was an avid reader of the Tintin comic books as a youngster and I also watched some of the first cartoons of it. After seeing the trailers on TV, I told my wife that we had to see the movie (she has never heard of Tintin). The movie was awesome! It was true to the comics, the CGI graphics were amazing, the 3d effect was cool, lots of excitement with added humor. One thing that I noticed was that Tintin seemed to look like he's in his late teens or early twenties. While in the comics I've always perceived him to be in his mid to early teens. Also, Tintin seemed to have a serious demeanor about him in the movie, whereas in the comics he seemed more jovial. Nevertheless, this is a must watch if you were a Tintin comics reader or not (my wife wasn't and she still enjoyed the film). Oh and what's with the extra $3 charge for 3d movies?"
"coneill97","6","1","1","10 May 2020"," An Enjoyable Yet Underwhelming Animation
","While Tintin is a fun, exciting film, I had expected more given the creative team involved in this movie, including Steven Spielberg as director, Edgar Wright as co-writer and Peter Jackson as a producer.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a fantastic title sequence magnificently scored by John Williams, which sets the tone for the film to come. Although I had not read the source material by Hergé, I was certainly aware of them and appreciated the wonderful nod to the original, iconic, two-dimensional artistry of the comic book which took place during Tintin's introduction scene. From here, the movie quickly distinguishes itself from what came before, with the motion capture animation feeling fresh and inventive.<br/><br/>The motion capture technology works very well here. All human characters are easily able to display genuine emotion on their computer-generated faces, never feeling lifeless or distracting. While the human characters are beautifully realised and have a realistic look to them, the animals feel closer to standard cartoon animation. Moments featuring a cat and a herd of cows stood out from the rest of the films visual look. Even Snowy did not seem to be rendered as well as Tintin or his human counterparts, although his presence is never distracting.<br/><br/>The cast does a great job with Jamie Bell doing a great job of bringing the titular character to life. And while it was nowhere near their best collaborations, it is always great to see Simon Pegg and Nick Frost on screen together. It was also fun to watch Daniel Craig give an enjoyably villainous performance. Andy Serkis, as Captain Haddock, was the heart of the film, however, getting the only real character arc in the film.<br/><br/>While the movie was entertaining and engaging throughout, the ending was slightly anticlimactic. It ends abruptly on a cliff-hanger, without any real resolution. This is particularly frustrating since we are still waiting on a sequel almost ten years after its release."

","The Adventures of Tintin is beautiful. Its CGI brings this film to life, as it looks exactly like a live-action film. This film has incredibly loud scenes, including the crashing of water or the sirens of a boat, or even a few scenes including shouting. But those aren't worrying. There is no blood in the film, just brilliant acting and animation but there are scenes of alchoholism. There is a captain on a boat who is addicted to whisky. There are several bottles of whisky on the floor, and you can see the liquid round his face.

","A kidnapping and a mutiny kick off the start of what becomes a dangerous and profitable journey for that most famous of Belgian boy detectives and his loyal fox terrier, Snowy.<br/><br/>What you get in the end is minor Spielberg and minor Tintin. At least its heart is in the right place.<br/><br/>As a drink-plagued captain with a bulbous nose tells his young friend: ""You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it.""<br/><br/>Here's hoping they follow their own advice and come up with a long- awaited sequel!<br/><br/>Revisiting the joys of childhood can be a perilous experience, and so it proves here, even if what's good outweighs what's bad. Director Steven Spielberg serves up an enjoyable lark of a cartoon adventure featuring that marvel of European comics, Tintin. If it lacks the cohesion and charm of Hergé's original, it keeps you in your seat till the end.<br/><br/>Spielberg's enthusiasm and talent is on bright display. Too bad the film veers more in the direction of his old ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" than Tintin himself. This adventure involves three lost scrolls which together present a key to finding a great treasure. To get them, Tintin (Jamie Bell) and his new friend, Captain Haddock (a note-perfect Andy Serkis) will have to brave the wiles of the evil Sakharine (Daniel Craig), a ""sour-faced man with a sugary name.""<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of motion-capture animation, even well-done animation such as this, which is presented with a nod to Hergé's ""clear-line"" style. Colors are deliciously bright, with a strong sense of depth and detail in every frame. Yet the adjustment from print to film medium gives the original characters a whiff of the grotesque.<br/><br/>After some opening credits that employ the clear-line style as well as a John Williams score and animation that seems a nod in the direction of Spielberg's classic beginning to ""Catch Me If You Can,"" we are dropped quickly into our fast-moving story. Hergé himself pops up to say the first line of dialogue, seemingly blessing the enterprise with his presence, before Tintin finds himself in a case of mast distraction involving a search for a missing piece of a ship model.<br/><br/>This opening section is so enjoyable you wish it could continue forever. It does last a while, all the way up to the point where Tintin and Haddock fly a seaplane in the desert wastes of Bagghar. There's a couple of welcome appearances from the Thom(p)sons (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg), and some harrowing battles that allow the director to recycle old tricks in motion-capture form.<br/><br/>Humor, too. Asked if he can fly a plane, Tintin replies: ""I interviewed a pilot once!"" Haddock and Snowy later vie for a drop of the hard stuff in zero-G, a film highlight. <br/><br/>After that, Indiana Jones takes over. The result is too crowded and chaotic by half. In a March 2015 review here, jc-osms describes his ""battle fatigue"" with some of the setpiece action scenes, and I heartily concur. As dams burst and derricks clash, Hergé's gentler approach is missed.<br/><br/>But ""The Adventures Of Tintin"" did connect with audiences, especially outside Spielberg's native land. That provides motive for a long-promised sequel, hopefully involving second-unit director and co-producer Peter Jackson, who unlike Spielberg grew up reading Tintin and will perhaps invest a film with more of the original spirit, like he did with his Tolkien adaptations.<br/><br/>As it is, I don't think the film stands well enough on its own to be remembered. But as a foundation stone, it could yet prove the start of something quite grand and fun for generations of Tintin fans yet unborn."

"Tweekums","8","1","1","1 December 2012"," A fun family adventure film
","When young reporter Tintin buys a model of a sailing ship he has no idea what an adventure it will lead him on. The model itself isn't that valuable but it holds a clue to a cast treasure that has lain at the bottom of the ocean for centuries. To be more accurate it holds the third of a clue; to find the treasure one must reunite three scrolls secreted onto three models of the ship; The Unicorn, and legend has it with these three scrolls a member of the Haddock family will be able to find the treasure. It takes a while before Tintin learns this of course; at first he just knows that a couple of people are very keen to buy the model off him and one of them won't take no for an answer. Shortly after one of the potential purchasers is shot dead in Tintin's doorway he is kidnapped and taken aboard a freighter bound for Morocco. If he is to survive he will have to get off the ship along with its drunken captain Captain Haddock; the last descendant of Sir Francis Haddock; captain of the Unicorn!<br/><br/>When I saw trailers for this film I thought the CGI looked a little too good; distinctly in 'uncanny valley' territory but when I came to watch the film itself I soon stopped noticing it; in fact I think it may be the most realistic looking fully animated film I've seen. While the characters don't look quite real; often due to their large noses, they do look surprisingly human. The use of motion capture rather than more traditional animation means that the movement looks particularly natural; so much so that when something cartoony does happen it comes as quite a surprise.<br/><br/>The story is a good fun adventure that can probably be enjoyed by all but the youngest children. There is a good plot but it isn't convoluted and never gets in the way of the almost constant action. There is a degree of violence although it is rarely bloody; in fact the only blood I recall was part of a clue and definitely not excessive. The cast of fairly well known actors does a fine job although none of them look like themselves due to the characters being made to look like their comic counterparts rather than the actors. I'm not sure how the story compares to the original comics as I never read them but it is a fun film for the whole family to enjoy."

","on a whole i'm not all that enthusiastic about CGI photography, especially in animated movies. i think that the emphasis on reality and live action squeezes the spontaneity out of the characterizations and backgrounds. i happen to like the painted, impressionist quality of the backgrounds in traditional hand drawn animation. however i did like this movie and found it involving. it was very similar to 'Polar Express' for me, liked the film but didn't warm to the process.<br/><br/>personally i think Disney and the amazing Pixar do this better. Disney and Pixar give their CGI animated films a true characterized and stylized look that hand drawn animated films embody. 'Polar' and 'Tin Tin' lack the animated expressionism that say a 'Cars' or the incredible ' The Incredibles' has.<br/><br/>i did like 'Tin Tin' surprisingly despite it's short comings as a animated feature. i've read the 'Tin Tin' comics and would have to say this is a more than adequate adaptation. it also had a lot of charm and well done action adventure. the main character of Tin Tin and his doggie Snowy were also well conceived with Tin Tin himself being very adventurous and intriguing. the overall story was fairly involving as well.<br/><br/>all in all, not a great film and not as arresting a ground breaker in photography as you would think, but it was a good kid's flick and had a lot to offer in terms of conception and storyline.<br/><br/>for me CGI doesn't quite cut it over traditional hand drawing, so on the whole, i still prefer sticking to what's tried and true to the form, Disney's 'Dumbo' or 'Fantasia'."

","In the very first scene, Tintin is having a street artist paint a portrait of him. When it is finally unveiled, it looks exactly like the way Tintin looks in the old comics and the animated series. It is a very funny gag, but it is a dangerous one, because to me, it is difficult to outdo the old movies, for nostalgic reasons, if nothing else. The joke might also symbolize that The Adventures of Tintin is deeply rooted in the old adventure tradition, even if it looks new.<br/><br/>That being said, the film feels unmistakenly modern, for better or worse. There's really not a boring moment, with frantic, gravity-defying action from start to finish, but sometimes I almost wished that it were more steadily paced and drew from other aspects of Tintin as well.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a very fun film. The clumsy Thomson and Thompson are hilarious. The alcoholic Captain Haddock is almost too unlikable, though. Visually speaking, the animation is quite terrific, with stunning images of exotic locations, it has lots of good visual gags, like when a guy falls outside a pet shop and canary birds are circling around his head, and the transitions are innovative, like when Haddock's hand smoothly turns into the North African desert. The ending suggested that there will be a sequel, and if Spielberg et al. are able to refine Tintin's transition into the 2000s, I am very much looking forward to it."

","The first thought that came in my mind after watching the film was that I should not have read the comics before watching the film. Though I had not read the part on which this film was made but I did felt unsatisfied. The reason I suppose was that we have a habit to portray the characters in our own sense and when it doesn't match with what we see, we declare the presentation bad. Because of this philosophy I should not comment much on the film but I did not liked how captain haddock was portrayed. He should have been shown in much more anger rather than a bumbling fool. Although we see him doing foolish things in the comics also but that has style in it. The focus for most of the time was out of tintin. But that didn't bothered that much. Now coming to the story, I would say that it was not so interesting as there are much better present. Overall this was a disappointment for me.

","The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn is based on Herge's famous Belgian comic from 1929-76. It is directed by Steven Spielberg, master of adventure, and produced by Peter Jackson, who brought the technological wonders of The Lord of the Rings. It also stars a host of actors including Jamie Bell as the titular character, as well as Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Toby Jones and of course motion-capture expert Andy Serkis in the co- lead role. Not fully-animated but not live action, this film uses the motion-capture technology of the slightly nausea-inducing Polar Express and Beowulf. However, with Peter Jackson at the technological helm, the motion-capture is superb.<br/><br/>The premise involves Tintin, an ambitious and mystery-loving reporter and his dog Snowy who uncover a mystery involving the famous disaster of The Unicorn. This leads them to the drunk Captain Haddock (Serkis), the only one who knows the secret. However, villain Daniel Craig is also after the mystery. This leads to some absurdly fun moments.<br/><br/>Every actor is fantastic in their roles, especially Serkis' Haddock and Frost and Pegg's bumbling detectives. The film felt a lot like Indiana Jones, especially with Spielberg and John Williams' amazing score. Writers Joe Cornish, Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright deliver plenty of witty dialogue and the action scenes, most notably the motorbike chase in Morocco, had me buzzing with excitement.<br/><br/>The bad points of the film is that it is VERY fast-paced; a lot of things happen for a one hour and forty minute film, so it feels a bit rushed and it can be easy to lose track of the story. Nevertheless, Tintin is a fun, suspenseful and immensely enjoyable film, surprising me for its PG rating. A great Spielberg mystery adventure."
"mmushrm","7","1","1","17 March 2012"," A very good adaptation
","This movie is visually very good. There were times when I almost forgot that it is an animated feature and not live action.<br/><br/>The story plot and pacing is straight out of the TinTin adventure comics. I have to admit that it is a throw back from the action anime movies that we are now used to (dark, gritty, suspense etc). So while watching I felt that the movie was missing something. But when I thought about it and the TinTin comics I had read as a child, the movie is a true adaptation of the comics. A simple tale of mystery, action and adventure<br/><br/>The best way I can summarize and praise the movie is that The Adventures of TinTin is a visually stunning and accurate adaptation of the TinTin comics."
"StevePulaski","9","1","1","16 March 2012"," Not even a wee bit conventional
","In elementary school, The Adventures of Tintin graphic novels were the only thing I would read. I have read a majority of the books, which came in a large, hardcover format boasting three adventures in one book. That's what they were. They weren't stories, comics, or even vignettes; they were adventures. Involving, consuming, and utterly motivating adventures about a young journalist named Tintin who would go on mysteries and solve cases with his loyal companion, Snowy, an intelligent white dog.<br/><br/>Too bad I haven't read a Tintin adventure in a blue moon, so comparing it to the original works by the Belgian author, Hergé is simply out of the question. My memory has faded and time is greatly limited. With that being said, I can say that from the vague details that I remember, the film adaptation of the comics is true to its original, breathtaking source material. The story centers around Tintin (Bell) and his dog Snowy, who are caught up in a whirlwind of trouble after purchasing an antique model ship at a European flea market. It turns out, the ship contains an ancient scroll that, when put together with two others, reveals a message. Tintin teams up with the rum-guzzling Captain Haddock (Serkis), and gets assistance from the simple and dense Thomson and Thompson (Pegg and Frost) to discover the truth about the ships and what powers the scrolls might possess.<br/><br/>The film has a very good sense of action, and in today's world, that's one of the highest compliments I can pay to a film. We see beautifully recreated European cities, which is a break from the droning, ordinary cityscapes we are victim to so much today. I am also known to grow weary of special effects and chase scenes, but here, I was simply amused and in awe, especially by one that takes place in a skimmer plane that eventually ends up in the Sahara desert. I dare not spoil it for the viewers-to-be, but I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching an action scene unfold.<br/><br/>Some scenes are so tricky and complex, we wonder how Spielberg could've possibly held onto coherency while directing them. But he does. And that's the beauty of the man himself. I recently watched his underrated drama The Terminal, and noticed two things I never saw in Spielberg's work before. One, he has an uncanny sense of detail and an intricate focus on the little things in the background. He also never becomes pictorial, meaning he doesn't rely on background distractions and unnecessary supporting characters to unintentionally muddy the meaning. He's smart, attentive, and very, very crafty. The second thing I noticed is how well he directs films in condensed, claustrophobic spaces. An airport, where The Terminal took place, is not the easiest place to shoot at. Neither is deep in a cave like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, but Spielberg always does it and does it well. Some shots in Tintin are so complex, multifarious, and alive that we wonder how one man could've directed them without going mad or over-the-top. Just watch the film, then search up clips from an incoherent, maddening visual spectacle like Transformers: Dark of the Moon and you'll get two gleaming examples of art and junk.<br/><br/>I mentioned the film is animated. That it is. I've noticed some have mistaken it for live action online. Seeing the poster in the theater, I thought it was live action as well. The film utilizes the motion capture animation I haven't been so fond of recently. After seeing the dreadful Mars Needs Moms, I thought I'd be content if I never saw the tactic used again in my life. For that film, it was absolutely needless. There was no reason to go through the extra time, money, trouble, and agony to fit actors for suits and make them act out the motions of their characters just for a lame, forgettable space cartoon. Here, it's extraordinary. It seems Peter Jackson (producer on the film) and Spielberg have discovered a way to iron out the kinks in the procedure (even though the eyes still look a bit unnatural). Some scenes, like when the three are lost at sea, are absolutely breathtaking and you may even be amazed what you're watching is animation.<br/><br/>I fear that too many parents will rob their kids of the joyous experience The Adventures of Tintin will likely bring them. The film is filled with life, action, fun, and colors for the kids, and there's enough wit, interest, and grandiose ideas to share with the adults. It's an experience, whether you're a fan or not. Like many detective stories, it has substance in its story, but the true adventures are with the characters. Spielberg has had one of his most productive and successful years, directing a period epic, finally awarding a graphic novel with a film adaptation, and producing Real Steel, Super 8, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon. But the great thing about a film like Tintin is it knows its characters, setting, and plan inside and out, while other action films continue to ""play it by ear"" to see where the next missile will land.<br/><br/>Starring: Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, and Nick Frost. Directed by: Steve Spielberg."
"serge-logelain","6","5","12","30 October 2011"," OK but not as good as I expected
","Visually stunning, this movie lacks what makes the difference between a super movie and good one: a thrilling and clever storyline. Spielberg's Masterpieces like ET, Raiders of the lost ark etc.. made me expect much more. Only the visual part was fantastic, the 3-D effect was also a perfect addition in my opinion. A real work of art. However, to my regret, the magic did not happen today. I felt this movie was more at the level of Peter Jackson's King Kong ... not convincing in the end. I found the story too disorganized and too distant from the original comics series. The pace of the story also did not work for me. It is too action packed and, for a first movie, the characters are not enough 'constructed' to me. There were some good parts but some really bad ones (the Baghard scene with the Castafiore, the fight at the end ...), and not enough funny parts. It is a good attempt but it falls a bit short in the end, I think."
"AvBaur","7","5","12","30 October 2011"," A good adaptation of the Tintin comics--but it could have been better
","As a big fan of the comics I could think of quite a few ways in which this could have been better, but for the most part, I quite enjoyed the movie. It's very true to the comics, and packed with exciting action set-pieces. There is a flashback sequence of a crazy sea battle that is positively jaw-dropping. I didn't love the last set-piece involving cranes, though, and I don't understand why they left out the underwater treasure hunt from the comic--I thought the film could have used another interesting location. Visually, it's a bit of a mixed bag, although it certainly looks much better than any of Robert Zemeckis' mo-cap films to date. Some of it looks really stunning and some of the characters (well, Haddock) are fairly cartoony and work really well, while others are too realistic, and look a bit stiff and artificial (Tintin himself, Snowy, and the villain). All in all, I think a less realistic, more consistent approach would have probably worked better. A few more exotic, visually interesting locales wouldn't have hurt, either.<br/><br/>Still, I hope the movie makes some money and Spielberg and Jackson get to make a second one. Despite my reservations, they did get a lot of things right and I would like to see them adapt some of the other great Tintin books. Maybe they'll even find something interesting to do for some of the characters from the comics that made brief appearances in this one without contributing much at all."
"RadiSadek","3","4","9","25 October 2012"," Awful! Just Plain Awful Hollywood Crap or How To Make Money With Any Story You Get
","This movie should be considered the symbol of Hollywood stupidity, lack of inspiration and greed. Please let me explain why. <br/><br/>I have been an avid reader of Tintin since I was a small kid. I have read all of the Tintin comics several times(in french). Enough to know them by heart, actually! My favorite one is ""Tintin au tibet"". My favorite character is Haddock by far! I have even read books and commentaries about Tintin. <br/><br/>In my opinion, Spielberg's Tintin resembles Hergé's Tintin on the surface, hence in nothing. This proves that Spielberg is either not telling the truth by saying that he is a big Tintin fan, or that he made this movie for the masses. In either case, it is a bad movie. Here are the facts proving my point:<br/><br/>-Hergé's Haddock is a true depiction of human error and weaknesses: alcoholic, selfish, choleric, but in the same time so kind, funny and lovable. In other words, human. On the other hand, Tintin is the perfect hero: always trying to do good, never hesitating, very strong, etc. <br/><br/>-Spielberg's Haddock is unfunny, unkind and actually not lovable AT ALL! But the best comes in the end: when Tintin was hesitating and Haddock was so sure about doing the right thing and going for adventure and blabla. No!!!!! You cannot do that, Mr. Spielberg. This single thing proved to me that this director hasn't understood anything about Tintin.<br/><br/>It's all about the money honey! That's it and that's why the quality of movies sucks these days! Examples are numerous.<br/><br/>I don't want to debate anymore, but I would like to add that the movie is boring. Only the graphics are OK, but personally I don't go to the movies for the quality of the special effects.<br/><br/>And what about Haddock and his sheep-lover joke? Is this supposed to be funny?"
"shriharipandula","Null","4","9","23 March 2012"," Fake!
","First, a word about Rotoscopy: Rotoscoping is an animation technique in which animators trace over live-action film movement, frame by frame, for use in animated films. Originally, recorded live-action film images were projected onto a frosted glass panel and re-drawn by an animator. This projection equipment is called a rotoscope, although this device has been replaced by computers in recent years. In the visual effects industry, the term rotoscoping refers to the technique of manually creating a matte for an element on a live-action plate so it may be composited over another background.<br/><br/>Now! This movie is as real as live. Of course, it would be. It's rotoscoped. If the end result was to appear lively, why animation? Why bother? That apart, it killed the nostalgia, the brand value I have for Tintin. Mercilessly."

","The unusually named intrepid boy reporter Tin Tin buys a model sailing ship at a street market: this proves to unlock a mystery involving murder, adventure, and treasure.<br/><br/>Herge's Tin Tin comics stand alone: Herge's beautiful clean draughtsmanship perfectly complements stories which blend adventure, action, mystery, and comedy. In many respects it is surprising that they have not been adapted for the big screen before now (there is a decent series of drawn animation adaptations going back several decades). I imagine that the main problem with a big screen adaptation was how to go about it.<br/><br/>I guess that there may have been two main problems with a live action adaptation. One is the fact that the set pieces would not have been easy to achieve with live action. The other would be that people are often unhappy with the casting choices because they may not resemble their hand drawn equivalents.<br/><br/>CGI would appear to offer the ideal solution to these problems, and Tin Tin is Spielberg's first animated feature. It looks splendidly realistic with the sole exception of the characters. Many of the featured characters look facially like CGI modelled cartoon characters (which, of course, they are), while others look realistic, and this divergence is somewhat disconcerting. Tin Tin, apart from his trademark quiff, looks oddly realistic rasher than like his cartoon self and this, too, is a little disconcerting. However, many members of the audience are not going to be familiar with the originals, so I suspect that the decision to model like this is a good one.<br/><br/>Because apart from that, everything else here works well. The story powers along wonderfully - if anything, a little too well, because there is scarcely time to draw breath. The animation is excellent, sometimes breathtaking, and the 3D works well. John Williams' score is first rate, the motion capture performances are all fine, and the voice work is good (although I felt Daniel Craig's voice, though unmistakable, did not suit his character). There is a point of view that Tin Tin himself is somewhat devoid of character. While there is some justification to this, a) Jamie Bell's voice characterisation is excellent, b) Tin Tin has always been something of a blank slate because c) he is the tabula rasa on which a young audience writes their own character identification.<br/><br/>This movie is, above everything else, great fun."

"nickmesafilms","8","3","6","17 March 2012"," The Adventures of Tintin (2011) - Adventure + Mystery + Spielberg = AWESOME!
","Director Steven Spielberg and producer Peter Jackson has teamed up to make a film adaptation of the classic comic book series of 'Tintin' by Herge'. This movie is like a crossover of Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones"" movies with Sherlock Holmes. Now, we are left with ""The Adventures of Tintin"", and I'm surprised that this movie did not get nominated for Best Animated Feature Film this year. This is an entertaining and beautiful adaptation of a colorful comic book series. With the use of motion capture animation, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" makes the animation look crystal clear perfect, compared to ""Mars Needs Moms"", when they use this animation in a creepy profession. Jamie Bell plays Tintin, a young journalist, who tries to unlock the mystery of the lost treasure of a lost pirate ship, called 'the Unicorn'. With a scene-stealing puppy named ""Snowy"" on his side, Tintin then teams up with Captain Haddock, portrayed by Andy Serkis, the motion-capture genius that brought us Gollum from ""Lord of the Rings"", King Kong in the 2005 remake, and Caesar in the Planet of the Apes (Rise). Haddock is a permanently drunk sea captain, whose the ancestors of his past might be a clue to get to the lost treasure, before his arch-enemy, Rackham, portrayed by Daniel Craig, finds it first. We also get some comic relief from the hilarious Thompson twins, portrayed by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. Watching this movie from start to finish, is quite a wonder. I love those type of adventure stories, crossed over with a crime-mystery tale. The animation is such a wonder, the action scenes are just awesome, and the acting is just superb. Jamie Bell is clever as Tintin, Andy Serkis is awesome as Haddock, and Daniel Craig is good as the evil Rackham. The only thing that bothered me was there were some scenes in this movie that were not quite suitable for family audiences. There are scenes were people actually die, and some scenes include alcoholism and violence. That's not suitable for a child. The rest of this movie is super wonderful. This is a magical and entertaining motion picture that only Steven Spielberg can make. If you're in the mood for a family-fun, action-adventure, and crime- mystery Spielberg movie, then batter up! ""The Adventures of Tintin"", in my review, ""a fun and entertaining adventure-mystery flick""."
"MovieCritic33-6","6","3","6","8 February 2012"," ""Billions of blistering barnacles!"" A Review on The Adventures of Tintin;
","ACTORS: Jamies Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, and Simon Pegg.<br/><br/>PLOT: Tintin (Jamie Bell), a reporter from Brussels gets tangled up in a mysterious adventure to find out a secret upon the purchase of a model of the Unicorn, a three-masted sailing ship. With the assistance of his faithful dog Snowy, Thompson and Thompson (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg), and the short fused Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis). They plan to thwart the plans of a vengeful villain, Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig).<br/><br/>ACTING: The best voices come from Thompson and Thompson (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg) and Sakharine (Daniel Craig). Tintin (Jamie Bell) I found to be too irritatingly whiny and Captain Haddock (Andy Sekis) to be an overly obnoxious Scotsman.<br/><br/>Tone: A humorous, rather lighthearted, action adventure in the vain of Indiana Jones (so do expect some mature themes and content).<br/><br/>SCRIPT: Loosely based off three of Hergé's Tintin comic books, The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn, and Red Rackham's Treasure.<br/><br/>PROS: Incredible CGI and 3-D visuals. Intriguing and enjoyably fun (for the most part).<br/><br/>CONS: Unlikeable voices for the two lead characters. Drags out in scenes. Plot loses itself at times with the stellar CGI and 3-D visuals. A few cheap gags.<br/><br/>VERDICT: If you liked this film, than watch the cartoon from the 1990's, I still found this film to be enjoyable but the cartoon is still more pleasant to watch. Spielberg and Jackson should have focused on one story instead of three. They portray Haddock a little over the top as an excessive drinker and I find they used him as a gag one too many times to earn some lousy laughs. They tried too hard with making an action packed adventure that they forgot the simplicity of the comics. Having said that I did find the film to be imaginative and nicely interwoven between stories, even though I did not see as necessary. Definitely preview before buying."
"gid_rulz","8","3","6","4 January 2012"," Does the name no harm
","So as a 17 year old, I grew up after Tintin was big but i was always a fan, but making it now a lot of the audience would not know exactly what Tintin is about. When i heard Spielberg and Jackson were involved i was extremely excited and then the trailers came out it was right up there as one of my most anticipated movies for the holidays. <br/><br/>The motion capture animation is absolutely astounding, i saw this in 3-D and even though usually I'm not taken back by the new, high tech fads but it was beautifully done and there were some incredible effects made. It's obvious that Spielberg and Jackson had a huge amount of fun making some awesome transition shots and beyond imaginable action scene which were so out of this world but just purely entertaining. <br/><br/>There is a few issues with this film though. At time the dilogue is rather stilted and seemed really unnatural. The big issue though is the pacing of this film, it goes from huge-faced pace scene to slow, wandering shots that just can get rather irritating, but it only becomes really bad with about 15 minutes left in the film. <br/><br/>The jokes in this are brilliant, Thompson and Thomson have some incredible humour, while the small, subtle jokes are easily the ones that take the cake. Its definitely got a lot that kids will enjoy, with quite a lot of slapstick, but there is a lot of long speeches that might be a bit confusing for the really young kids, i say maybe only take kids 10 and up to this one. <br/><br/>This is the first film i have seen in the cinemas since the first Harry Potter Deathly hallows came out and this was definitely a film that i was proud to see. If you are a fan of the comic books you will definitely agree it does no harm to them, and they have done great to try and bring it to a new generation. This could be a big franchise and i recommend it highly, its not the greatest film ever, but its certainly worth the cash and time. 8/10"
"selarom-yar","8","3","6","2 January 2012"," Tintin at 10:10
","I saw this movie last night at 10:10pm. It was truly a great movie. Yes, it is not photo-realistic like, for example, Avatar, but is it motion-capture heaven! When Spielburg does his trademark ""rush close-up to the eyes, you see the wrinkles and even the translucent fuzz on the face of Tinti. The set designs the art work and the action as well as the drama parts are well done and crafted.<br/><br/>Ah, the music. I have to admit that if it were not the masterful music of John Williams ting the scenes together and pushing the plot long the story would have been lost. At times when the plot slows down and it is looking for either a way out or to change in a different direction, John Williams music comes to the rescue.<br/><br/>I have grown up on the movie of Spielburg and the music of John Willimas and I have seen all of the movies, I have to say that they have a working symbiotic relationship to film making. When one needs help the other is there to provide assistance. A question comes to mind, can Spielburg make a movie without that symbiotic relationship with John Williams? Can the filmmaker survive with the composer? Oh, yes, the story line. It maybe that the story is based on 2 or even 3 of Tintin adventures, but what a masterfully telling of it all. Some will be against about it, but remember just like Lemmony Snicket where that have to interweave 3 books together to make a movie longer, besides the adventures of Tintin were times interrelated like any good serial are. The writers had to intertwine the stories together to make and sensible whole. If they were to make a movie out of one, like some people will say that it should be done that way, then it will be a ""short movie"" and not a ""feature movie"". Now what fun will that be that you have to come back to the theater to see part two, three, etc. Yes, it will be a great money maker but it will destroy the theme of the movie and the story line.) So even though have not read Tintin, or have not even heard of Tintin, this is an excellent introduction to him and his adventure.<br/><br/>Why 8 out of 10 stars? At times (rearely) the story stumbles and if it were not the music of John Williams to the rescue, we would have been lost in the thicket.<br/><br/>Long live Snowy!"

","Young and confident investigative journalist Tintin (Jamie Bell) purchases a model boat of the Unicorn, a three-masted sailing ship, from a market, only to be approached by the sinister looking Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig) who offers him triple the amount he paid for it. He refuses and, along with his trusty dog Snowy, takes the ship home, only to unwittingly coming across a cryptic note that was preserved with the model that mentions a secret involving the mysterious ship and a family line called the Haddocks. Tintin is kidnapped and taken aboard the ship of Sakharine where he finds the drunken Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), locked in a room with only whisky for company. The two must combine their wits and unravel the mystery of the messages which may lead to them to secret treasure.<br/><br/>The original comic books by Belgian artist Herge, and eventual cartoon series that came from it, have a huge dedicate and passionate fan base that were both eagerly awaiting and dreading Steven Spielberg's re- imagining. Not being a fan myself, I would imagine the fans would be happy with this effort, as although the look of Tintin is certainly very different, the old-school feel of the original works is certainly there. The film combines three old Tintin stories - The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure. This is possibly the film's biggest floor, as although it certainly looks amazing, and the film has a definite nostalgia-tainted, labour-of-love feel, the story just isn't up to scratch.<br/><br/>The performance-capture animation is without doubt the most close-to- life I've ever come across. It captures every facial movement and the subtle expressions that allow the actors performance to come through the CGI. Jamie Bell injects a likability into a hero that might have come across as an annoying know-it-all. But the film really belongs to Serkis. Now a veteran of the whole motion-capture malarkey, his Captain Haddock allows him to show what he can do as an actor. He gets all the best lines and is involved in the more memorable scenes, notably when he's had a drink or two.<br/><br/>Thank God for the performances then as the plot has a lot to answer for. Combining the blockbuster minds of Spielberg, Peter Jackson, and long- time Spielberg collaborator Kathleen Kennedy, it's quite shocking that this is the best they can come up with. These are the people responsible for some of the best works in the mega-bucks department - E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial (1982), Jurassic Park (1993), the Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) - which all combined great storytelling, genuine passion, film-making know-how, and some old fashioned cinematic magic. Where Tintin certainly has the passion, the story just seems wafer-thing and very un-movie like, so to speak.<br/><br/>Understandably, they wanted to keep the adaptation close to Herge's original vision, but I just felt like I was watching an extended episode of the cartoon series that happened to have some very expensive animation. There is one notable set-piece, which involves Tintin, Haddock and Snowy fighting Sakharine at high speed for the last clue that may lead them to the Unicorn treasure, that would have been near- impossible if filmed in live-action. This scene, if anything, promotes the use of motion capture to take film-making to new levels, but it also happens to be amazingly choreographed and executed. But apart from that scene, the film never give me the shiver down the spine or got my pulse racing like the aforementioned films certainly did.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about the film, however. The most annoying thing about the original cartoons were the Thompson and Thomson twins (here played by newly-appointed Spielberg bum-chums Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), and here they are given little more than extended cameo roles, and it's clear that they're best enjoyed in small doses. Craig is fun as the villain, although his character is rather one-dimensional and thinly-written. It's also fun to spot the little winks and homages to the originals, that includes a truly brilliant introduction to Tintin. Hopefully when the inevitable sequel comes along, Spielberg can take the passion from this and put it into a better story. But this is satisfying enough for the time being.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","I'm afraid for most of this film I was positively bored and just waiting for the end. Cons - 'charmless' motion capture that does not work (sorry, no I'm not, Andy Serkis, this development in cinema should be stopped now), 3D (what a con because it adds nothing to the film and they charge £2 extra at my kino), far too reminiscent of Indiana Jones (Tintin can stand on its own), too long Spielberg sequences (the crane and the pirate fight episodes were interminable), and the referential visuals (even got in 'War of the Worlds!'). So, no, not a good experience. It bounces along in familiar Herge vein at times, but the cartoons were as good if not better. The voices were not bad, but Tintin and Captain Haddock are too nice and schmaltzy American-like, witness the dear old Captain battling drink and alcoholism towards Spielbergian redemption - oh dear, oh dear! And my final rant - Brussels (for US audiences, I suppose) is made up of cockneys and English people! Please, Steven, don't insult Europeans even if you spend a lot of your time insulting Americans!!!!"

","First off I have been reading Tintin over and over since I was 6; I am a huge fan to the point where I can mostly name the book from one picture. Since hearing that Steven Spielberg was making a film of the books I was concerned that he would not remain faithful to the original books and the level of detail and storytelling would get lost in the bid to make a one off blockbuster.<br/><br/>I went with my 9 year old son, who is also a fan of the books, to see the film this afternoon, and I was blown away. <br/><br/>The book is based on ""The Secret of the Unicorn""; however as all the characters need to be introduced Mr Spielberg needed a mechanism for doing that and so decided to weave ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" into the story line, which seemed a little odd from my perspective but my son was bowled over, it was a bit clumsy at times but it did work.<br/><br/>Mr Spielberg doesn't remain 100% faithful to the story line however there are large parts of the film lifted straight from the book, but the need to fit the story into a film that kids will sit through and the sheer amount of the story that needs telling he does a very good job, that said there are subtle nods to the original characters of the book, I won't go into too much detail in case you haven't seen the film, but for those who are fans of the books will smile when they see them. The story is an epic, reminding me of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" in the telling and running along at a rate of knots meaning if you blink you will miss something.<br/><br/>The quality of filming, 3D and sound have all been discussed to death here already so I won't go into detail other than it's all top notch. All in all much better that I thought it would be and well worth a couple hours of your time, and if it gets you to read the books, you will discover a great set of stories. I hope Mr Spielberg follows through with other stories in the series, my favourite being ""Red Sea Sharks""."

","I just came back from watching Tintin and first thing I have to say is that I enjoyed it! I'd been afraid that Spielberg would mess it up and that digital Tintin wouldn't be my cup of tea, but it was fine.<br/><br/>The opening scene was perfect, I got so excited at Hergé making a caricature of Tintin (it's a pleasant, personal scene) and the market actually being the Foxmarket in the Marollenwijk in Brussels! I'm also glad Spielberg decided to go for an animation, because that way they could make all the people look the same way they do (from their clothes to their faces) in the strip which was such a joy. And oh, I loved the articles on Tintin's wall referring to strip titles and Bianca Castafiore's appearance! I hadn't seen that coming, it was fun! I also thought Tintin's portrayal was interesting. In the strip he's pretty blank, but in the film he felt more like a real human being. The scene where he went ""I can smell it all over you"" to Haddock with an annoyed tone is what made him feel most real to me.<br/><br/>The story itself was nice, though I felt a bit bad they turned Sacharine into a bad guy, but oh well. They combined some strips and they did it well, I think.<br/><br/>The only negative point is Captain Haddock. Captain Haddock was a bit too much of a hopeless drunk for laughs for me. In the strip he's still a bad ass alcoholic, but in the film he's whiny and pretty dumb. Especially that cheesy speech of his to Tintin didn't feel like something Captain Haddock would do.<br/><br/>I also have some mixed feelings about some scenes - mainly the pursuit in the Moroccan city - being so obviously made for 3D. That's just me though because I don't feel the necessity of 3D in films and think of it as a way to rake in a bit more profit.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm happy. The excitement around the film made me pick up and reread the Tintin strips again, reminding me how much I loved to read them again. I feel tempted to go see it again. I'm even slightly wishing for another Tintin film, but as the majority of sequels are disasters I'm fine with only one Tintin film.<br/><br/>8/10!"

","I adore movies and stand in wonder at the imagination and brilliance of those able to create them. So, this is a first for me; writing of a movie that left me aghast, and from such a posse of exceptional talent, beginning with Spielberg.<br/><br/>I am appalled. This movie did not leave me cold; it transformed me into a popsicle. What was that insipid background music from John Williams? I imagine he looked at the initial cuts and longed to come down with a longish illness so that he could get out of the contract, and concluded to just put notes to paper and get the hell out of there.<br/><br/>So much acting talent and so little to work with; I can't find fault with anyone who trusted Spielberg to pull it off. After all, this is Spielberg. The man is a genius; surely he must have a vision that eluded those who could not see it in reading the script. Nope, their intuition was correct. This movie was a stinker from start to finish; from concept to credits.<br/><br/>I hope that Spielberg bounces back with ferocity and a killer flick. Adventures of Tintin needs to be forgotten and relegated to the movies-that-should-never-have-been section of collective memory."
"sascha-17","6","2","4","2 March 2016"," Spielberg doesn't understand Tintin
","Minor spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>While impressive on a technical level, this big-screen-adaptation of the Tintin-adventures fails to capture the essence of Hergé's brilliant creation.<br/><br/>The problem is ""tone"". What was, in its comic-form, a semi-realistic detective-story for adolescent boys has been turned into a cartoon-y slapstick-fest aimed at preschoolers.<br/><br/>Tintin of the comics existed in a semi-realistic world. Yes: There were moments of silliness and convenient coincidences, but generally speaking, the world Hergé created adhered to a kind of realism and seriousness. And that's precisely why I loved the comics growing up. Here were tales your parents would let you read, but which treated you and your intelligence with a kind of ""respect"" rarely found in other kid-friendly comics.<br/><br/>Not so in the movie, which bombards you with one wacky, mind-numbing action-scene after the other and dumbs down its story and characters to appeal to 6-year-olds.<br/><br/>Let's just take a couple of examples: The Unicorn ""dream-sequence"" of the comics was presented as a realistic sea-battle - in the movie it looks more like something out of a Looney Tunes-skit. With burning ships getting lifted from the sea, people performing impossible feats of athleticism, etc. All of which defies any sort of real-world-physics.<br/><br/>Characterization - for example: The Thompson-twins. These two were never a favorite of mine in the comics either, but the movie takes their stupidity even beyond slapstick-levels - as evidenced in their scene in Mr. Silk's apartment. Sure: In the comics, these two guys were mostly incompetent and naive - but in the film they act like a pair of lobotomized chimps.<br/><br/>Tintin's and Haddock's escape on the plane. In the comic, this was a pretty intense and disturbing scene. Haddock was acting like a borderline psycho, trying to knock Tintin out because he wanted to fly the plane himself. In the film, it's just another collection of physically impossible stunts, ending with Haddock belching into the plane's gas-tank. Seriously? <br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point of criticism and that is a lack of restraint on the part of the film-makers. Yes: a film done entirely in CG gives you incredible freedom. You can place your camera anywhere you want to, you can have characters perform incredible, physics-defying stunts. But in Tintin, they've taken these two ""advantages"" so far that it actually hurts the movie overall. When your hero survives one impossible stunt-sequence after the other, the novelty of it all wears off pretty quickly. Consequently, we stop caring - because we've seen him survive this sort of stuff over and over again, so why should be get invested when the 10th such sequence comes along?<br/><br/>Lastly I have to address the poor choices in screen writing. Even though this film is called ""Secret of the Unicorn"" it throws elements of at least one more adventure into the mix (""The Crab with the Golden Claws""). I can see why they did this in order to have Tintin meet Haddock, but I can't help but wonder why they chose either ""Unicorn"" or ""Crab"" as starting points in the first place. <br/><br/>Neither are exactly among the stronger Tintin-stories - a fact which the screenwriters seem to acknowledge themselves by switching tons of details around like cutting characters or transforming a minor character from the comic into the film's main villain.<br/><br/>6/10 - mostly for its technical strengths and to acknowledge the relative ""audacity"" of adapting a comic-series that's probably not very widely known in the US."

","First, I have never read the Tin Tin comics so I just have the movie to go by. I thought it was great! The story flowed well, the characters were very well done and the animation was fantastic. I really enjoyed the way that the film introduces us to Tin Tin in the opening credits. It was a good thing too, because the only thing I disliked about this movie was the beginning - it didn't seem to introduce anyone really well and seemed a bit rushed, so I kind of felt lost for a bit. After that though, I found myself really caught up in the story. The characters were great and I loved the dog! I really forgot it was animated, it seemed so real."
"stevenbaldock13","4","2","4","16 April 2012"," Great film thats not very good.
","The hard to fathom title is exactly how I felt about this film. On one had it had good humour, pleasant effects, a good story and lots of action. On the other hand it had too much silly action, the story got to the conclusion in a hap hazard way and after the scene was set, the effects to often felt like a bit of an excuse to have wildly unrealistic action scenes. <br/><br/>Things were going very nicely for the first 20min. The story is set with intrigue surrounding a mysterious model ship that a lot of people seem to be very interested in. Tintin finds this ship in his possession and after a man is shot trying to warn him of the dangers involved with those who possess it, I was sucked in wanting to know what is so special and who are the people that want it so badly. The ship is then stolen during a break in but a clue is left in Tintins apartment. After some investigation and introductions of other characters Tintin gets kidnapped and locked up on a ship. He manages to escape from his guards and ends up meeting the interesting and funny drunk that is captain Haddok.<br/><br/>So far so good I thought. We had some interesting characters, some investigation work, a bit of action and the start of a mysterious story that could lead to anywhere. <br/><br/>This is where things started to go downhill. Haddok and Tintin escape the ship and manage to steal a plane from their former captors. Que the unneeded ridiculous action. The plane runs out of fuel mid flight and the only thing to do is to get Haddok to climb out to the fuel tank and pour some medical spirit in to it. Needless to say it doesn't work and they crash land. Don't worry though everyone survives, including Cpt Haddok who was riding on the front of plane. From this point on, the action snowballs in to a big ball of silliness that I found too much and really quite boring. <br/><br/>This film could have been brilliant if it had stuck to the same pace as the first part but instead it shoved too much craziness in when it just needed to take a break and remember that the main character is great at solving puzzles. Think Indiana Jones and the crystal skull if George Lucas had made the whole thing from animation."
"The-Sarkologist","7","2","4","6 January 2012"," Not anywhere near as good as the books, but quite entertaining nonetheless
","I love the Tintin comics and have done so since I was in Primary School. I remember that I would scour the shelves in the fiction section of the library looking for books that I have not read, and attempting to get my hands on those that I have not read. To date I believe that the only comic I have not read would be 'Tintin in the Land of the Soviets' though I also believe that I may not have read 'Tintin in the Congo' as the only version I ever remember was one in German, and my research has revealed that both were not translated into English until after Herge's death.<br/><br/>Tintin is a Belgium reporter who goes on quite a few wonderful adventures throughout his career. While the first couple of comics involved him simply as a reporter traveling to foreign lands, since the Cigars of the Pharaohs, he evolved into an independent crime fighter, and slowly grew a number of allies around himself. The Thompson Twins (two bumbling detectives labeled the greatest detectives in the world), Captain Haddock, an alcoholic retired sea captain, and Professor Cuthbert Calculus, a rather eccentric scientist who is a little hard of hearing in one ear. The Thompson Twins and Captain Haddock appear in the movie, but the books upon which the movie is based appear before Calculus is introduced into the series, so as is understandable, does not make an appearance. Obviously, there is his loyal Terrier Snowy.<br/><br/>This movie is based on two of the books, Secret of the Unicorn and Crab with the Golden Claws. While at first I thought that it was only Secret of the Unicorn, after Tintin was kidnapped and woke up on a ship, it became clear that the plot had moved away from the original book and had incorporated a second one. After the film, I sat down and watched both of them from the cartoon series, and of course my suspicions were confirmed. However, it does not faithfully stick with those two books. In the book Sacarin is a minor character what appears a couple of times, however in the film he turns out not only to be the villain, but is also the descendant of the Haddock family's arch-enemy Red Rackham. This never appears in the book nor is the Haddock family curse.<br/><br/>The difficulty with making the film would be trying to find out which would be the best book to turn into the film, considering that there are (I believe) over twenty of them. To somebody new to Tintin, it would be very difficult to make one of the later books into a film since there is a lot of backstory involved, and while my favourite would be Cigars of the Pharoahs, it appears that they wanted to have Haddock make a major appearance in the film, which does not happen in that particular book.<br/><br/>I could go on for a while picking it to pieces, but I really do not want to do that because I did enjoy the film. They did capture the adventurous nature of the Tintin books quite well, though I could see a lot of Spielberg's influence in it (which is not surprising because he is the director). While I never consider Spielberg films to be really high on my list (I will never get the six hours back that I spent watching Close Encounters – twice) he does make entertaining adventure films, as the three Indiana Jones movies testify (not counting the fourth, which I suspect not many people do) and The Adventures of Tintin does not disappoint. However, being the purist that I am, I always find myself wanting to go back to the books themselves, as they are so much more entertaining (particularly with Snowy's dry comments)."
"Eumenides_0","8","2","4","2 January 2012"," It's full of adventure
","I was having a look at my shelf full of European comics (as opposed to my shelf full of American comics), and my suspicions were confirmed: I only have one Tintin album in my collection. And my memories of reading it are very sketchy. I probably enjoyed the art; I've always admired Hergé's style. The story I can't remember. Something about the young journalist never appealed to my reading tastes.<br/><br/>So the prospects of a film adaptation never fascinated me. But I allowed myself to be dragged into the movie. Perhaps it was this lack of interest that resulted in such a fantastic experience for me.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie I kept waiting to hear the Indiana Jones theme. That's how fast-paced and exciting the movie was. The Adventures of Tintin doesn't waste time setting up the first arc. As soon as the animated credits sequence starts we're promised adventure, mystery, dashing escapes, humour and action. And action is what we get in the form of naval battles, swordfights, feverish car chases, and much more. The movie plunges the viewer right into the story, with Tintin buying a mysterious model ship at a flea market only to be warned by a terrified man that his life is now in danger. With his curiosity roused, the intrepid journalist's investigation takes him aboard a ship where he meets Captain Haddock and Sakharine, a criminal in search of a sunken treasure.<br/><br/>The movie is first and foremost an introduction to Captain Haddock, as well as his rehabilitation. When Tintin meets him, command of his ship has been taken away from him by a mutinous crew and the poor Captain is consoling himself with copious amounts of alcohol. We learn that Haddock descends from a long line of worthless ne'er-do-wells, with the exception of an ancestor who once loyally served the King of England and allowed a fabulous treasure sink rather than let a pirate get his hands on it. For someone who's mostly familiar with the world of Tintin through the 1990s animated series, uncovering Captain Haddock's mysterious background acted as a gripping way to reintroduce me to Tintin. I don't know what fans will think about this adaptation, but I believe the movie succeeds as a gateway to casual viewers.<br/><br/>The motion capture animation originated many fears and has generated a lot of criticism, but I wish to assure viewers what director Steven Spielberg does with the animation surpasses Robert Zemeckis' disappointing forays into this technology. The movie is closer to Avatar than The Polar Express. The animated characters are expressive, fluid, slightly exaggerated, and always captivating. Spielberg is a filmmaker who knows how to use technology and has always been in the vanguard of new techniques, so I have no ideas how anyone could fear the animation will be anything less than stellar. The characters not only seem to be imbued with independent life, but the world Spielberg creates is full of little details and visual jokes that will keep viewers coming back for multiple sessions and, when it comes out in DVD, using the Pause button a lot. The first of such details is the affectionate cameo of Hergé in the first minutes of the movie, complete with a nod to his original artwork.<br/><br/>I wrote I kept expecting to hear the Indiana Jones theme, but that's not just because of the similarities. Sadly this movie isn't perfect. John Williams fails to find a worthy main theme for Tintin. I don't believe anyone will come out of the theatre humming the theme he composed for the movie, let alone remember it after a couple of days. Being an avid film score collector, I made the mistake of listening to the music before watching the movie, and I found it bland. It works remarkably well in the movie, I later discovered, but it's not an iconic theme that sticks in one's memory. And that's a shame because Tintin is a hero who deserves a theme instantly recognizable as his theme, as easily as Superman is recognised by the theme Williams composed for him in 1978. I fear Williams' efforts will not dethrone the theme Ray Parker and Tom Szczesniak composed for the animated series, in the minds of fans.<br/><br/>Is things movie going to be a success or a failure? I can't say. Motion Capture movies tend to fail at the box office, as Zemeckis can attest. And Tintin, in spite of being a mega-star across the world, is irrationally obscure in the USA, which is not yet a negligible market in this globalised world. But I urge viewers to give it a chance; if nothing else, for 107 minutes you'll be in the presence of Steven Spielberg's old magic, which nowadays is rare indeed. That was once a great selling point. I hope it can be again.<br/><br/>And if there are any sequels planned, may they come as quickly as possible."
"joshua-l-quimby","9","2","4","28 December 2011"," Loved the books as a child, the movie pays a fitting tribute
","I grew up reading various of the Tintin books as I could find them from our school library. Leading up to this movie coming out, I decided to read the books in chronological order. That said, I found this movie was remarkably close to the books, taking such a large amount of material direct from the stories. In many cases, I knew the scenes frame-by-frame before they came on the screen. In modern Hollywood, where many classic comic books have gone way off base (I think of the X-men and Batman movies, for example), I believe this is the most accurate depiction of a comic I have seen yet. Sure, they replaced Herge's basically nameless bad guy (an art collector) with someone who has more vested interest in the story and they added several stunts that were unrelated to the books (the much maligned crane fight). Sure, they also cut most of the exploration for Red Rackham's treasure, but it would have been unnecessary and the end seems to indicate they may still pursue it in a sequel. But, this is still very accurate and very similar to the writing of Herge. The majority of complaints that I have read seem to surround characters not having enough background and the plot not being very clear, but even that is authentic to Herge. Many of the Tintin books start by Tintin being shot at, kidnapped, attacked or something for no apparent reason. The story just jumps from item-to-item as Tintin discovers the plot and explains it to Snowy, Haddock, etc. There's not a lot of background, Tintin sees a sinister plot and he pursues the bad guys. If you downgraded the movie because of that, you did not know enough about this story going in. I would like to see future adaptations have this same level of authenticity."

","I have always been an ardent devotee to all good stories of adventure fictions genre. Though the two men,Hergé and Steven Spielberg are from two very dissimilar time and medium of work, their extraordinary accuracy and minuteness in every detail work put them on the same high pedestal. I have huge appreciation for marvelous master workmanship delivered by both Hergé and Steven Spielberg in their respective fields. Even if I tried, I couldn't say that I am the only one in my immediate circle, who knew who Tintin was before the release of this movie. To begin with, I have many friends from childhood who very much like myself, have been justly allured by the inescapable appeal of heroic Tintin. I have no hesitation to say that I probably was the most obsessed-by-Tintin kid in my group. My husband who is a Swedish is naturally not new to Tntin either. He also grew up with Tintin books. But I took this obsession far more seriously and probably somewhere down the line of my subconscious search for Tintin I had discovered Tintin in my European husband ( Of course I am joking but I happened to have heard this joke number of times from my family). That being said, it becomes quite evident that I had been slightly flawed...

"rodionmyshkin","7","2","4","5 December 2011"," Please be more faithful to Herge, Mr. Spielberg....
","Well, expectations were really high. Spielberg. Jackson. Tintin. What more can you ask!!! But sadly, I guess, you could have asked for a bit more faithfulness to Herge. The movie is worth a watch, but could have been loads better. Starting with the credits, you seem hopeful that the pace of the narrative will take your breath away from the word go. Yet Spielberg and company take their time, which is a good thing. People new to Tintin may need to tune up to his zest for adventure and story. Spielberg did try hard to break free from his Indiana Jones tradition, essentially upholding its roots, to showcase a comic adaptation which is worthy of his efforts. The animation is wonderful. Even without 3D glasses, it looked sharp and detailed. Still, there is not much to bring out in the 3D World, where I hope Jackson would prove his worth in the next installment. The hunt for the unicorns, in the first half, tries to hinge on Spielberg's plot turns from the original. The writing is a bit off in a few places as you miss out on some of Tintin's genuinely ingenious ideas. The best parts of the film all come in the second half in the form of Haddock's flashback in re-creation, the final port showdown, and the unbelievable single-shot chase scene which truly was the treat for me.<br/><br/>As far as performance goes, it's Jerkins' Haddock that is most faithful to Herge. His short-tempered madness, delusional frenzy is easily the driving force in the second half. Tintin is good for most parts, but I did feel he was an Americanized version lacking some of Tintin's Hergeian sensibilities. Thompson and Thomson were under utilized – I can't see the logic why, Mr. Spielberg. They are an integral part of the Hergeian world. But I am happy to see Snowy, Tintin's Man Friday, given enough screen presence. His antics were enjoyable and fun.<br/><br/>All n all, I guess, the creators missed out on building a coherent end. Combining Crab with the Golden Claws, Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, there seemed very little time to come to a lucid finality with this one. The reference to the Eagles' cross, which is scarcely stressed before, acts as a simple lucky find. The secret in the three notes were also given less attention. Maybe Mr. Spielberg thinks they are a bit outdated. Hope at least he is saving it for Peter Jackson to uncover its clues next time around. Hey Jack, show our Spielby how to make film adaptations, my man. You are exceptional at that. Ho, ho, ho, and a bottle of rumRed Rakham's treasure, here we come!!!!"
"Boba_Fett1138","7","2","4","3 December 2011"," A promising start to a potentially great new film-series.
","Personally I never have been a too big fan of the whole Tintin franchise. Neither the comics or television series could ever appeal to me and I was never too big on its premise, characters or visual style. I therefore could also never really understand Spielberg's fascination and passion for the franchise. However having seen this movie I can perhaps understand it. The time period and settings are all perfectly adventurous and the movie offers plenty of entertainment.<br/><br/>The way I see it; this movie is a great first introduction of its characters to the world and its showcasing the many possibilities of making Tintin into a long running series of adventurous movies. Potentionaly it really could become a great, quality series, that will offer entertainment to many, for many years to come. As things are looking now, there will be at least two more Tintin movies but why stop after that really? With its motion capture and other computer techniques, the possibilities for the series are literally endless. They could do whatever they want with it and can get as crazy as they want to. Even when the actors will be too old for their roles they could still play them, since the movie and all of its characters come entirely out of the computer.<br/><br/>And yes, the animation is way better than I could had ever anticipated. with one movie, Spielberg succeeds at what Robert Zemeckis has tried to do for years; creating a good- but above all, realistic motion capture movie. The movie is incredibly smooth and wonderful looking, especially with its stunning backgrounds. But also the characters themselves are quite flawless. The way they move around, their expressions, it's all like you're watching a real movie!<br/><br/>This is also thanks to the professionalism of all of its actors. Andy Serkis is of course the go to guy, when it comes down to motion capture acting but with this movie he is once more showing his incredible range and versatility as an actor, playing Captain Haddock. You might not even know its him, since he's speaking with a fat Scottish accent. There are way more actors in this movie that you might not even recognize. Daniel Craig as the main villain, Jamie Bell as Tintin, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Thomson and Thompson. Would you honestly know it where them, when looking at their performances or listen to their voices? They of course also look nothing like themselves, since they play characters based on well known comic book characters, though eventually in the movie they still like more human than cartoons.<br/><br/>I actually think it was a great move to go for a realistic approach, as far as regarding the movie its look. I always feared that the movie would be far too cartoon like looking, with exaggerated colors and typical cartoon looking characters. But as it turned out, all of the characters are very human looking, with only some slightly exaggerated big noses, which was distinctive for Hergé's, the creator of Tintin, drawing style of its characters. Perhaps the only real still cartoon like looking character in this movie is Snowy the dog.<br/><br/>With its exotic and far off locations, its John Williams musical score, the time period its set in and its many action, this movie does definitely feel like an Indiana Jones movie at times. Especially the action stands out, even though it goes far too over-the-top at times but you could of course 'blame' this on the simple fact that the movie got based on comic books. Spielberg finally even gets to show his love for the good old swashbuckler genre, by throwing a couple of spectacular sequences, involving pirates and some good old fashioned sword fights.<br/><br/>Yet I don't really regard this movie as perfect entertainment, since the story still seems to be lacking a bit. I actually had a hard time following the story and things got quite messy at times. There is not always a good flow to it, though the movie also never starts to get truly bad or boring, or anything like that at all. It's just that a better written, or better constructed way of storytelling, could had improved this movie significantly. Seems they were more focused on getting the technology and looks for the movie right, rather than its story. So who knows, maybe for its sequels the movies will feature a slightly better written and more tight story in it, since they already clearly know how to get the visuals right and know what the possibilities with its technology are.<br/><br/>So it's not the perfect entertaining movie but still a great and promising start to a series, that potentially could become a wonderful- and long running one.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"griffo-86546","6","0","0","27 June 2020"," Close, but not quite
","The good:<br/><br/>The animation and visual effects are amazing with a breathtaking level of skill in crafting an incredibly detailed, elaborate, colourful and realistic world. Judging this movie on visuals alone would warrant giving this movie a 10, and, similar to Avatar (2009), it seems that some reviewers have done just that.<br/><br/>The voicing and characterisations of Thomson and Thompson and Bianca Castafiore are great, in the appropriate doses and true to the books. The various nods to the books are also welcome. The cuts between Haddock retelling the fight between Sir Francis and Red Rackham were well handled, even if the fight itself was somewhat embellished and over the top.<br/><br/>Another reviewer lamented the lack of a love interest, but I am including that as a positive that one was not introduced into this story for the sake of it. A love interest is NOT a mandatory ingredient for an excellent movie or TV series for that matter, and especially not the contrived variety of love interest that you see far too often in most Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>For the most part, the movie is fun.<br/><br/>The bad:<br/><br/>The movie can't decide whether it wants to be a children's movie or a nostalgic movie for adults. On the one hand, there are guns, swordfights and murders. On the other hand, the humour seems to be mostly targeted at children, for example, where Snowy is used to try to create laughs.<br/><br/>Another issue is that too often the movie gets swept up in long action sequences, which can feel like a rollercoaster at times. But just because I love rollercoasters, does not mean that I want to be on one for 2 hours.<br/><br/>Some reviewers have criticised Tintin's character as being devoid of personality and whilst there is some merit in that, it is consistent with the books. But where there is limited material to draw on, it is even more critical that the personality that does come across is true to the source, and here the movie fails at one key point in the movie by portraying Tintin as a defeatest.<br/><br/>However the real failure in my mind, is the depiction of Haddock. Others have mentioned that the voices of Tintin and Haddock were not what they imagined from the books and whilst I agree, particularly with the comments about Tintin's whiney voice and Haddock's unnecessary Scottish accent, I acknowledge that it would be difficult to please everybody. I expected Haddock to be a lot more stoic and have more grit like one would expect from a man who has spent years at sea. Here he seems just too silly and cartoony, particularly with that giant nose. I don't know if it's the giant nose or the way he moves around but he also appears to be on the plump side in the movie but not in the books.<br/><br/>It would be better if the books were followed more closely, but that can be forgiven with the limited time that the movie had. In particular, finding the treasure was anticlimactic when the whole adventure was based on finding the scrolls. It would have been better to have more of the movie dedicated to searching for the treasure itself as in Red Rackham's Treasure, and Professor Calculus was sadly missing, but both of those aspects may be covered in the sequel.<br/><br/>Finally, the problem with an ultra-realistic and lifelike cartoon is that it makes it harder to suspend disbelief in things that you can normally get away with in a cartoon, for example, Haddock burping into the plane engine to keep it in the air, and the numerous times the parchment is lost and regained by a whisker during the chase scene in Bagghar. I think that it would have been better to simply decide on a cartoon or a regular movie and stick with it instead of trying for a hybrid."

It really did bring back my childhood memories with this one, and the tale of the Unicorn well that is what managed to persuade us to get mini-me to watch it.<br/><br/>I really can't get over the animation on this it was truly amazing, but then I expected nothing less from two of my favourite directors! What a duo. We are taken across land, sea, desert and even a bit of the sky! It was amusing and thrilling with a lot of action and I know I am looking forward to the next one!"

","Very fun movie all around and it has great performances to go with it! What's not to love? I grew up with Tintin and have been reading tales and stories of him ever since i was a child, and although i did recognise the fact that they spliced 3 stories together (even noticed it as a kid when it came out) I am not opposed to the changes, as i believe a completely accurate retelling would've gone against the Tintin legacy."

","Now, who doesn't enjoy Tintin? Or a great action adventure? 'The Adentures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn' has it all: action, adventure, humor, drama, fantasy, and solid storytelling.<br/><br/>Ok, so this is what I refer to as cheat animation, since it is not entirely animation. Real actors were used, and a lot of the scenes were actually performed by these actors. So its not just an animated film with voice over work. The result, however, is incredible. 'The Adventures of Tintin' is visually stunning and the characters are life-like (needless to say). Interestingly enough, Tintin wasn't my favorite character here. Captain Haddock was. He was the most interesting character with the most fascinating back story. He was humorous and all-round likable.<br/><br/>The film cleverly combines fantasy elements in this action adventure. There's a lot of slapstick humor and although I generally don't like slapstick, I didn't mind it much here. Off course, also keeping in mind - being animated - it would be aimed at a young demographic, although off course to be equally enjoyed by adults. The pirate battles were incredibly well done.<br/><br/>'The Adventures of Tintin' is an all-round top notch production, with a captivating story, compelling characters, beautiful animation and excellent voice-over work. This is a film to enjoy again and again."

","Let me just start off by saying, just like Catch Me If You Can this film has so much effort put just into the opening credits alone, Steven Spielberg puts SO MUCH effort into all of his work and you definitely can see it in this movie, too! The motion capture looks so realistic that after a while I even forgot it was a motion capture movie. Just like some of Spielberg's other work, this film has developed a cult following since its release which is VERY understandable.<br/><br/>We get into the plot of the film and this is when it gets really interesting, Tintin purchases a ship for a pound at a market and this item, supposedly, has a lot of background history, Tintin goes to a library and researches about the ship and discovers that it was a replica of a ship made in the late 16th century, but just as Tintin returns home, he comes back to discover that his ship had been stolen by a man at the market who said bad things happen when people take hold of this item. He goes to the Marlinspike Hall, a big bulky dog comes chasing after Tintin and his puppy, but Tintin's dog toughens up and they become friends.<br/><br/>Tintin enters the Marlinspike hall through a window, little does he know that our antagonist, Sakharine, Red Rackham, played by Daniel Craig and his supervisor are staying in this place protecting the first original ship. Our protagonist then gets knocked out by an old man, Nestor, he finds out that the ship Red Rackham has in the Marlinspike Hall is not his, it was a second one which Sir Francis made and they're both identical. I could study this film all day and never get bored because of how much of a fun time it is and it has also got to be my favourite film of the decade!<br/><br/>Score: 10/10"

1. Stunning animation and special effects, from the characters, properties, and landscapes.
2. A thrilling mystery full of cool action scenes.
3. Successful motion-capture technology adaptation.
4. The humorous Captain Archibald Haddock played by Andy Serkis is enjoyable.
5. Great lesson: persistence.
6. The story is interesting.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1. The antagonists always missed the target when firing guns.
2. How possible could the opera singer destroy the bulletproof glass with her voice?
3. The chance of survival of Tintin, Snowy, and Captain Haddock on the ship, on the seaplane, on the lifeboat, on the dessert, and during chasing scene in Bagghar was tremendously high, with no injury.
4. Tintin's house was accidentally very close to the port, therefore Snowy was able to keep up.
5. When Red Rackham's ship was stuck with Sir Francis Haddock's, it was too heavy to swing above Haddock's ship.
6. When Sir Francis Haddock was trying to escape, no one was guarding. When he was setting the ship on fire and fighting Red Rackham, no one woke up.
7. How could Sir Francis Haddock survive after he destroyed Red Rackham's ship? How could he know the coordinate of the drown treasure?
8. Captain Haddock was fit and strong enough to hang onto something and hold his weight.
9. The destruction in Bagghar was massive, how could it be easily solved?
10. How could Tintin and Captain Haddock attend the The Milanese Nightingale? There should have been invitation and heavy guards. Captain Haddock and Tintin did not wear proper clothing. When Captain Haddock was making a mess, guards should have started securing him.
11. If the miniature model of the Unicorn was very valuable, how could it be sold in an outdoor market for just 1 pound? Could the seller not understand the value? How could it be there in the first place, because it was supposed to be given to a Haddock only?
12. How could no Haddock understand that there was secret message inside the model ship? How could Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine know that? If there was no survivor from Red Rackham's side, how could the secret and story be passed down?"

"williampsamuel","7","0","0","10 April 2019"," A Fitting Tribute to Classic Adventure
","Since its creation more than eighty years ago, The Belgian comic Adventures of Tintin has been one of the most successful entries in the 'boy adventure' genre, with millions worldwide following the exploits of the young reporter. Yet the strip has never gained a particularly wide following in the States. But that may be about to change thanks to Steven Spielberg's brilliant film adaptation.<br/><br/>Wasting no time on set up, Tintin jumps strait into the action, with the purchase of a model ship leading almost immediately into a rousing, highly improbable series of adventures that will take Tintin across oceans and deserts in search of a fabulous sunken treasure. Along the way, Tintin, his faithful dog snowy, and the perpetually drunk Captain Haddock will face off against mutineers and Arab tribesmen, narrowly escape all manner of sudden death, and receive the dubious aid of the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thompson.<br/><br/>Lacking even a hint of subtlety, Spielberg's Tintin is one of the most ridiculously -and awesomely- over the top adventures since the original Indiana Jones films, with its sheer implausibility never becoming a problem. With this kind of movie, knowing that the hero would be dead a hundred times over in real life is part of the draw. After all, in a world where a baby faced reporter and a small dog can survive plane crashes, shootouts, and a high speed chase with rocket launchers, it's not hard to imagine that you could be a dashing hero as well.<br/><br/>Tintin is heavy on the action, with lots of fisticuffs, gunplay, chases, and -via rum-fueled flashback, swashbuckling pirate action strait out of Hollywood's golden age. There are also plenty of laughs, mostly related to Haddock's continual inebriation and the Thompsons' incompetence. Perhaps the funniest moment in the film comes when Haddock finally sobers up. The film is rather weak on character development, but that's forgivable given that this is an action thriller and a kid's movie. I also found some of the big twists to be fairly predictable, but I'm sure that most younger viewers will be suitably surprised.<br/><br/>Visually, Tintin is a real treat for the eyes. Utilizing the very latest in CGI, the animators have created a world that is remarkably lifelike and yet at the same time highly evocative of the original comic's art. The soundtrack, by veteran composer John Williams, is excellent as well. Although it may lack the spectacular flourishes of his work on Star Wars and Jurassic Park, Tintin's jazz infused score provides a good counterpoint to the onscreen action.<br/><br/>It may not be Spielberg's best movie, or even his best kid's movie, but Tintin is still great family entertainment, fully on par with Pixar's recent offerings. And it's a fitting tribute to the venerable comic, lovingly made by one of its biggest fans. I'm sure that Spielberg had lots of fun making Tintin. And I'm sure you'll have lots of fun watching it."

","1 January 2012. One of the best animated adaptations to the full theatrical screen of a comic strip character and storyline. The technology has arrived at a point along with the strong script that resonates with its original cartoon material. Perhaps almost overly long with an almost forced condensing of an immense amount of material of three of the series stories, the film nevertheless manages to create a magical experience that neither live action films based on human characters in a real world nor the fantasy animation of animated characters can reproduce. In the best of both worlds, Tin Tin can feature amazing physical action that audience are willing to suspect their disbelief and experience almost Disneyland spectacular ride for themselves. At the same time the film effectively captures both the spirit and the personality of the original cartoon strips themselves. The transformation to film is somewhat more dark, at times, and physically intense than the more passive colored flat 2-D images on the page. Whether or not the animated technology will subsume the live actor performances within a decade is another matter."

It gets boring when they just easily solve things with no hardship at all.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
It feels like Hadokks was supposed to be the character that justify's Tintins blandness but he never does that, he is just a man that drinks he has no character arc at all cause they focus more on the story than characters.<br/><br/>VILLAIN

"Animated_Antic","9","0","0","16 October 2018"," A fun and exciting adventure from Steven Spielberg.
","Director Steven Spielberg really is a director that understands how much of an art form animation is. Since the 1980's, he has been involved in animation in someway which included producing animated films like ""An American Tail"" and ""The Land Before Time"" and founding the famed DreamWorks Animation Studios though despite his huge achievements, he had yet to actually direct an animated movie. Then in 2011, he went and directed the animated adventure ""The Adventures of Tintin"", based on the famed Belgium comics by artist Hergé and boy was it an exciting ride. With great source material like this, you'd have to either go big or go home. Spielberg went big as he brought on some big talent to work on the movie and it surely did pay off.<br/><br/>After young journalist Tintin (Jamie Bell) buys an antique model pirate ship called the Unicorn at a market in Brussels, he and his dog Snowie discover that there is a huge secret behind the ship that the model is based off of. Then one night, he discovers his model ship has been stolen and goes off to discover that the model ships have a mysterious past when the owner of another model named Ivan Sakharine (Daniel Craig) has also had his eyes on the same ship that contains a tiny scroll which will lead to an ultimate treasure. He has gotten one of the ships himself which contains the scroll. All that's missing is a scroll to a third model of the Unicorn. During a scuffle, Tintin finds himself captured and finds himself partnered with a drunk captain of the ship named Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis). Hoping to uncover the actual secret of the Unicorn, the two escape the ship and plan on finding the hidden treasure before Sakharine does.<br/><br/>While watching ""The Adventures of Tintin"", I began to see that Spielberg really dug down into his routes from ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and the other Indiana Jones movies to make this film and he was the perfect director to helm it. Not just because of his experiences with Indiana Jones, but also because the author of the comics, Hergé, was actually a fan of his work and believed that he could be the only one to do his work justice as he was very unpleased with prior attempts to bring the Belgium reporter to life. Spielberg also brought on some great talent to work on the movie which included Peter Jackson producing it and Edgar Wright as one of the co-writers and they really make a fun and exciting ride for this film. There is lots of fun adventure in the story and it really does have a fantastic combination of the great action from ""Raiders"" and the fun tone of ""Tintin"" and it also didn't lack in the humor as well. I was surprised at how funny this film was, but then again when you have the director of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" working on your movie, you know the comedy is gonna be great. I was intially worried about the animation considering it was motion capture and I still remember the dreaded ""Mars Needs Moms"" which was released the same year. Though luckily, my worries quickly passed over when I saw how great it was in the end. Considering that the animation was provided by Weta Digital, the same company that brought to life Middle Earth in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, they really hit it out of the park. It doesn't go into the uncanny valley and it really does look beautiful. The characters also were great and you couldn't have picked better actors to play these characters. Jamie Bell as the adventurous and brave Tintin, Andy Serkis as the drunken Haddock, Daniel Craig as the evil Sakharine, and Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as the bumbling deceives Thompson and Thompson couldn't have been more perfect. They also don't ham up their roles either and give it all one hundred percent and I'm really happy they did. If I did have to criticize something about the movie, it's that some of the action scenes do go on a little too long. I love good action, but sometimes they can get boring after a while and after so much action, I really needed to catch my breath.<br/><br/>Still though, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is yet another fantastic action/adventure from Steven Spielberg. With a fun story, great motion capture animation, and characters that live up to the source material really make it a fun ride that's on par with the ""Indiana Jones"" pictures. It's certainly something to check out, even if you're unfamiliar with the original comics."

","This is not aimed at adults. I'm a guy, and I watch movies aimed at adults (sometimes maybe even literally--too much tmi there, no doubt); yet I still have to give ""The Adventures of Tintin"" very high marks. One way to put it is that the animation is as clever as ""Sin City"", but the mood is the polar opposite. I strongly dislike excessively pollyannaish films, since they don't at all reflect the world I seem to be living in. This is why I don't much care for Spielberg movies, which always seem to spring from the mind of a simple-minded, optimistic, eunuch. I hardly read any Tintin growing up, so I'm no fanboy and could care less if it followed the source material well or not. This was just a really well-made, fun, PG movie that parents can safely watch with children without worrying about moments of uncomfortable blushing. Surprisingly, I'm not at all embarrassed or ashamed to admit that I really enjoyed it. Simply put, the family-friendly story was satisfying enough, the run-time wasn't excessive, and the visuals are frankly fantastic. I would tire quickly if I watched too much uncomplicated ""feel-good"" stuff like this, but every now and then, a little bit of it might do the mind good."

","Although a Belgian, I've never been particularly fond of Hergé's work : when I read the Tintin series as a child, I liked it well enough but I did not adore it. As an adult, I can recognize its technical prowess and abundant imagination, but I still don't think it's as stellar, innovative or unique as some critics would have it. (Still, credit where credit is due : with ""The 7 crystal balls"" Hergé created one of the most scary comics of all time. The moment where a grinning Rascar Capac, both alive and dead, enters a building can wipe the floor with about 99% of the horror scenes contained in movies, comics or novels. It is the essence of nightmares.) <br/><br/>As a result of my lukewarm attitude, I began watching ""The adventures of Tintin"" without particular expectations. I'm pleased to say that it's both a clever, respectful adaptation and a pleasantly watchable movie. There are (at least) two brilliant set-pieces worth the price of admission alone : the first is the episode where captain Haddock tells of the heroic adventures of his ancestor, and the second is a long and bonkers pursuit through a North-African country. All over the movie there are touches of wit, satire and invention, just as there are moments of clever observation : note the scenes, for instance, where the poor have to queue for water in order to survive, while the idle rich surround themselves with fountains, canals and swimming pools. Authors have written 500-page works on social inequality that say less. <br/><br/>I watched the movie with some youngsters, who all left dazzled and enchanted : no mean feat in these modern times.<br/><br/>The scene where Bianca Castafiore sings is very well done - there is a truly glorious stream of music coming out of her mouth - but I was somewhat amazed by the choice of music : if I remember correctly, the various comics had her singing ""The jewel aria"" from Faust. The jewel aria too is delightful, plus it would have allowed the great diva to perform in Germanic peasant costume, complete with blonde braids. Perhaps some Tintinologists can help me clear up this matter."

","I enjoyed watching this recreation of Tintin's The Secret of the Unicorn. The voice performances made me care for their trouble and made the mystery engaging to be part of. It also changed my opinion about the motion capture animation style. <br/><br/>To begin with, you must know that it doesn't deliver a movie completely true to the comic book, because some characters have been given pretty big roles despite minor roles in the source material. Fans will perhaps feel offended by these changes, but I am forgiving, because what we got was an exciting take on the characters we love. <br/><br/>I am still impressed by how Red Rackham's involvement with Captain Haddock is portrayed. It really kept my eyes glued to the screen just like many of the other action scenes. They can be pretty intense. <br/><br/>It makes for an action-packed mystery with great voice performances to keep you engaged and entertained."

","For some reason we had to watch this movie in French class in 8th grade.<br/><br/>Rating - How the hell is this movie rated PG? I was under the impression that graphic depictions of blood and violence weren't appropriate in children's movies. I'm not saying that kids movies can't have violence and/or stakes to the plot, but this movie gets pretty bloody. There are a lot of scenes in this movie with machine guns as well. There is a scene where an old man gets shot to death, then has to write out his final words in blood. Based on the overall content, this movie probably would've worked better as a life-action adults' film. All you would have to do is make the plot slightly more complex and it would've been better. <br/><br/>Plot - The story is a simple, kinda predictable crime story. Its ok. Pretty entertaining, but the runtime is a bit long. <br/><br/>Characters - The dog is the most intelligent character in this movie. The human characters are all really dumb. <br/><br/>Animation - The animation in this movie is absolutely phenomenal. <br/><br/>Scene Transitions - Almost every transition is the same thing - the camera zooms in on an object and it fades to a similar object somewhere else. One example of this is a boat in the ocean fading to a foot stepping in a puddle. I have nothing against this type of transition, but when almost every scene transition is the same thing it gets visually boring. I spent a lot of the movie complaining about this along with some of my classmates. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie isn't as entertaining as it could be. It could've been a lot shorter, which would've made it less boring. The animation was great, but most of this movie is really dumb."

","The Tintin comics have been in my life since Primary school, I have no favorite when it comes to any of Tintin's adventures. I was no fan of the cartoon adaptations, i t was just like reading the comics without seeing the speech bubbles. But I was thrilled with this one, the animation was so realistic, it was like watching an actor play Tintin instead of voicing him, this time I felt Hergé's creation had finally come to life. Being a long standing fan of Tintin, I understood the merging of 'The Secret of The Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' but was aghast when I saw 'The Crab with The Golden Claws' was also added, it sort of made the film's plot seem rushed. And why change the villain? Plus, I felt his real grudge against Captain Haddock was also stretched too far, though I liked the nail biting duel between them. Captain Haddock has never been a character I was fond of, in this movie I simply hated him. Sorry if I am been dramatic , but Haddock's passion for alcohol makes him behave foolishly and do stupid things, he was downright annoying and irritating more than he is in the comics. And as for Tintin, he is ever the optimist, why make him suddenly decide to give up when it seemed the villain had won? That was wrong of the writers. And while he seemed more realistic than in the cartoons, he remained the enigma he was in the comics. What do we know about Tintin? A reporter who travels a lot and gets into mysteries accompanied by his white fox terrier Snowy. What is his family background? Why doesn't he have a girlfriend? Does he work for a particular paper or does he sell his stories to different papers who pay him for it? We still know little of him, after all these years. All the same, I liked this movie and I LOVED the wonderful homage to Hergé by depicting him as the street artist sketching Tintin. Hergé (rest in peace) will be glad how far his creation has lasted."
"texlaw-04452","5","0","0","19 April 2017"," Disappointing for one reason!
","Since seeing the movie, there has been one thing that has continually nagged at me about Spielberg's treatment of Tintin. I have loved Tintin books for around 40 years so you have to bear in mind this is written from a long loved Tintin Fan's perspective. Interestingly, I have also long loved Spielberg's movies with one of my favourites being his first, the haunting masterpiece, Duel. So what did Spielberg get so wrong with the movie? To answer this you have look at what is the book series appeal. It is 3 things. The story lines/scripts, the Ligne claire artwork and the character design. It is the character design that Spielberg fails at for one reason only. In the books, every character, without exception, has a cuteness about them. Every character from the main cast to the most evil villain has a cuteness about their face. Admittedly this cuteness did decrease with the later books(compare Dr Ridgewell from Broken Ear to the same in Picaros)however they were still cute characters. In the movie, it is like Spielberg has gone out of his way to make a lot of the characters ugly and grotesque. The one's that especially come to mind are Haddock and the Thompsons. Compared to their book counterparts they are ugly and command no compassion or empathy especially when in the books their cuteness offsets their character's short comings. Tintin only just escapes the ugly and grotesque label however compared to the book, he is still a lot harsher. This can also be attributed to the dead eyes that Spielberg did not get right. Additionally the storyline and splitting up of story elements was also disappointing but could have been forgiven if the characters had not been destroyed."

","Based on the legendary comic albums by Hergé, The Adventures of Tintin was an attempt by Steven Spielberg to bring the very European hero to the American audiences. And no better man to do it, since Spielberg himself has self-admittedly drawn a lot of influences from Tintin for Indiana Jones, for example.<br/><br/>And what a fantastic film. Based on three of Hergé's albums: The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, it tells about a sunken treasure and clues to its location hidden within old artifacts, one which ends up in the hands of a young reporter, Tintin, pulling him into the plot. Along the way nefarious plots are uncovered, colourful (and occasionally hilariously foul-mouthed) characters are met, exotic locations are explored and all in the name of good fun, excitement and, above all, adventure. Picture perfect plot and the action supports it beautifully. It's exactly the same brand of thrills that made the Indiana Jones trilogy such an iconic adventure classic. Glad to see that Spielberg had at least one of these still left in him.<br/><br/>He also gets the characters very well. Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) is exactly the same kind of pure hero in a fictive cape we've come to known from the comics. Daniel Craig as the villain is a lot of fun and captures the archetype of a cultured baddie beautifully. But my, and probably everyone's, favourite character is without doubt Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), a drunken rot of a sailor, who still shines from within with past glory and a core of iron and timber.<br/><br/>My only real gripe with the film is that I'm not a fan of the motion-capture style of animation utilized. All the backgrounds look great and allow for some really fantastic action segments, but the characters themselves teeter just on the brink of uncanny valley. Their faces are expressive and their motions have been captured well, allowing for some really good acting moments, but the skin textures are more than a little plasticky. Overall the quality of animation is good, but it could have been better.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, The Adventures of Tintin is a great film. I really hope they make a sequel because this is easily a franchise equal to Indiana Jones in terms of potential."

","There are many great reviews already pointing out the excellence and at the same time serious issues with this animation film.<br/><br/>I can agree to most of them.<br/><br/>Being an computer professional and animation fan, I can really appreciate what is done here. The effects and attention to details in every dust, mirror, glass. The smooth transitions between scenes parts of the story is spectacular.<br/><br/>I have no problem to give the technical side a 10, it is stunning.<br/><br/>But the story. Yes, it say ""The Adventures"".

For many that will not be an issue, but if you are a Tintin fan it can serious ruin the pleasure.<br/><br/>I saw the film some time ago with my kids and we enjoyed the movie, but that was it. They don't know the world of Tintin and nothing was conflicting for them.<br/><br/>But now, if I try watching it again, the fun of the stunning animations effects has gone away and it is very hard to enjoy the movie because it raises a conflict inside. The characters, the scenes, the stories, it simply makes no sense anymore.<br/><br/>For me a good movie, is one you can watch more times.<br/><br/>This movie, I could only once - sorry. Now I can go through every frame in still view and enjoy the details, but that is it.<br/><br/>I can't watch it as a movie anymore.<br/><br/>10 for effect, 0 for story<br/><br/>IF the creators had kept the story intact, make 2 or 3 movies with less endless effects - there could easily had been 2*8-10 instead of 1*5.

"JoelPeterBrown","10","0","0","22 April 2015"," A Review Break 4 Casting Directors: Tintin
","On the meaning, worldview, characters' behavior and interpretation. <br/><br/>On Meaning: describing what the story is trying to say. It appears to me that the story has a good message, and one that I picked up came from the scene when Tintin was sitting in a lawn chair discouraged from the looks of it as the captain approached him a pep-talk of encouragement. In that I got to thinking about all that went on in the film, and this is what the story is trying to say, don't send out the wrong signals of failure, and don't give up on the journey in search for answers.<br/><br/>On Worldview: describing what values are in use by the characters or in the plot. One value that I picked out in the movie 'Tintin' that is used by the characters are the following: Abundance, Accomplishment, Achievement, Activeness, Advancement, Adventure, Ambition, Aggressiveness, Agility, Amusement, Boldness, Challenge, Competition, Discovery, Drive, Eagerness, Encouragement, Endurance, energy, focus, humor, outdoors, skillfulness, wisdom, zeal, winning, and wealth. What brought me to this is that the characters was always fighting in various scenes. The captain seemed to have been fight for his ship and gold in his hallucinations, Tintin was fighting for the answer to write his newspaper story. Moreover; one scene that pointed this out for me was when the captain encourages Tintin with these lines, ""...fight for want you want."" <br/><br/>Discussing the characters' behavior based upon biblical principles. The biblical principles that Tintin's behavior reminded me of perseverance/focus - 'seek and you will find.' Because all throughout the scenes Tintin was always searching from something and he was focused on finding it, whether if it was as simple as a magnifying glass to something much harder like the secret poems with that revealed the hidden numbers when pieced together in which he always found what he was looking for. The biblical principles of the captain's behavior reminded me of edification/temperance 'Do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths, but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen.' and 'Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with a continual lust for more' why I chose these for the captain is whenever he wasn't drunk, he seemed to be in his right mind and would say words that would lift another character up as this would confound you after seeing him doing foolish thing after drinking alcohol. Two other character's behavior that remind me of biblical principles is the two cops (Thomson and Thompson), as they showed sympathy/Justice/Mercy 'To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God.' the scene that gives an example of this is when Thomson and Thompson are in the library of wallets with the thief that has been pick-pocketing people searching through different wallets, and both cops aren't even aware that the owner is a thief that stole all those wallets.<br/><br/>On Interpretation: describing what the movie means to you personally. What the movie means to me personally is don't quit on your journey in finding answers, and you will find the answers that you have been searching for being uncovered as you write your story through the adventures that life takes you. The biblical scripture that I can connect this film to comes out of Philippians 3:12-16 as it says, ""I'm not saying that I have this all together, that I have it made. But I am well on my way, reaching out for Christ, who has so wondrously reached out for me. Friends, don't get me wrong: By no means do I count myself an expert in all of this, but I've got my eye on the goal, where God is beckoning us onward—to Jesus. I'm off and running, and I'm not turning back. So let's keep focused on that goal, those of us who want everything God has for us. If any of you have something else in mind, something less than total commitment, God will clear your blurred vision—you'll see it yet! Now that we're on the right track, let's stay on it.""<br/><br/>The color and animation looked beautiful."
"orourkec-292-269155","7","0","0","10 April 2015"," It is a well done motion picture, even if it isn't fully made justice.
","I'm a fan of the Belgian Tintin comic books, so because of this imagine how I felt when I first learned that Tintin was made into a film and was coming to cinemas soon. When I first learned about this, I directly had a crescent-shaped smile forming on my face. I saw from the trailer that it was a half animated, half reality movie, which I thought perfectly represented Herge, Tintin's creator's world, rather than as a reality film. I felt excited to go and see this film, and to see how the comic book would turn out as a movie. I was excited to see the final result. But of course, whenever you go to see a movie, whether it is a half reality, half animation film or reality film, you're unsure whether the movie will be good or bad and you just keep your fingers crossed that the film will be good. Well, I felt confident that the movie would be good, because I realized that it was directed by Steven Spielberg, which surprised me, because I knew that Spielberg never ever made a computer-animated motion picture before in his longtime directorial career, and I was curious to see what he could do with a computer-animated motion picture adapted from a comic book for the first time in his life. I also felt confident that the movie would be good, because I knew that Spielberg was a talented director who made many successful films in his directorial career, and since the only distinction between The Adventures of Tintin and any of the movies that Spielberg directed is its thorough use of computer-generated imagery, I thought that this film would therefore be 'easy pie' for him to direct and make into a good film. Now, let's talk about my opinion on the film. What I thought was good about the movie is that it is incredibly well shot, has many truly admirable scene pieces, a good dose of healthy humor for both children and adults, an intriguing story (in its own right), nice tonal shifts, exciting action sequences and smart transitions. I liked Captain Haddock, and thought that he was an interesting character, because he is spirited and funny and he cheered me up with the things he said and did. Snowy also was a sympathetic character, and so was Tintin and the Thompson detectives. I thought that The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rhackam's Treasure comic books combined into a perfect and suitable hole for The Secret of the Unicorn film chapter. I liked the voices from the entire cast, and I thought that it was perfect and that it suited the characters they were playing. The quality of the computer-generated animation is arguably astounding. However, I thought that the flooding of the town of Bhaggar, the ship getting accidentally attached to the other ship, and getting itself pulled over it from the big waves, and the cranes battle scene were all a little too far-fetched-out and a little too American in style. Something else I would criticize in this film is Tintin and/or Haddock's lack of a character development. Nevertheless, I still think that The Adventures of Tintin is a fun and interesting film. My rating: 7.4/10"

","Being an avid Tintin fan since my childhood and admiring Steven Spielberg's work, I was really eager to discover this movie and I wasn't deceived.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is very enjoyable to see. It's looking like real characters while it's an animation movie. The Unicorn ship is a pure beauty. <br/><br/>Concerning the plot, I was disturbed at first because it's not the story I read in the comic books but I have to say that the events are really combining well giving the story some sense. A few characters are missing but I didn't expect them to appear like Professeur Tournesol. Maybe we'll enjoy to see him in the next sequel.<br/><br/>The only thing I maybe complain about is the tempo which is a bit low. Some moments are really sleepy and boring.

"willcundallreview","7","0","0","10 January 2015"," Adventure done right
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn is an animation adventure film that lives up to what you might expect and matches the skill of the original content expertly. With a story that also contains massive action scenes and a beautifully rich style of design, Tintin comes to the screen with a big crash, but lands very very safely. I felt it was a solidly good movie and here below is why so.<br/><br/>The story is very nicely done and paced well too with lovely locations used and characters who although very quirky, also imaginative. I felt the action quota in terms of fighting is not there but chase scenes are abundant and some of them are beautifully choreographed and put together using just immaculate style. It has it's humour too, not overly hilarious but has it's moments of light heartedness even in the moments it seems most unlikely.<br/><br/>People such as Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis and Daniel Craig lend their voices to the movie and do an excellent job in the process creating characters you don't just instantly connect with their voice actor. I like Jamie Bell as Tintin but he can seem slightly annoying at times, as if he is constantly in your face. Andy Serkis as Haddock is good and although his voice is rough and Corse, it still turns out well worked.<br/><br/>It is directed by Spielberg and written by a trio of writers who use the Herge originals well and also manage to not seem too authentic or too much like the comics. The style used for the animation for me is one of the most beautiful seen and is moved along fantastically. The animation has to be one of the best things because not only is the movement nice but also things such as the sea are defined with glorious colour and depth that really takes your eye to it.<br/><br/>My main criticism has to be the slightly fast pace of the movie, now I know Tintin is like that and I understand but sometimes things seem slow then boom Tintin is off and doing stunts impossible to achieve. There isn't too much to say negatively about it but it could be said the movie never quite reaches epic proportions and stays relatively at the same level from start to end.<br/><br/>This is truly one films for the kids and it highly enjoyable for a younger audience as I believe it has been made for. Saying that adults will also enjoy I think and unless you hate animation films then you shouldn't have many problems with little Tintin and Snowy on their adventures. If you like Indiana Jones then this is basically along the same lines although it's Tintin and Spielberg obviously brings his past in with him on this one.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a 7/10 and felt it a solid one of that, not quite a VERY good film but not far at all and a great effort is put in to make it good. Tintin I feel may make fans of the original adventures slightly nervous or watch with suspicion but I felt it was put in safe hands and executed with a swift touch and not over done or anything that could damage it's credibility as a legendary adventure series."

","What a fun, what a ride and alas it ended so very quickly.<br/><br/>Mind you, this is a Steven Spielberg film and he worked with Peter Jackson in production design. So this film has to be great or at the worst level good, and it indeed is great for me. No drama, no romance, rather no girl in the whole film actually. It's a straight adventure that is reminiscent of Indiana Jones in many ways. <br/><br/>I remember collecting TINTIN pages from the weekly magazine THE WEEK and making it into episodes. Alas, I lost those pages but I found him back again with this movie. <br/><br/>Every frame is picture perfect and is very well crafted. Be it the first scene of the look of ship through mirror or last scene of finding the treasure, every frame is top quality. With production budget that this film has and the brains that worked for the film, the minimum expectation is awesomeness in every scene and then it has to rise above the script to be called as a great movie. Now, if the first 15 minutes sounded bore then this film is not for you coz that was just the build up and basis for what lies ahead.<br/><br/>Once Haddock enters, he takes the film head on and makes it an adventure worth more than our money and time. Haddock, the captain who has a very typical accent came out in the best form and better than what I ever imagined. Best lines of the movie were by Haddock while the reactions for them by Tintin were mostly innocent and at times hilarious. <br/><br/>Though it's a great watch, I still cannot say it's a must watch for all those unaware of existence of tintin and you need to be really patient for great moments on screen to happen.<br/><br/>Best aspect was animation and yes, it is the best animated movie I saw all this year and this may well receive the best animated film Oscar. I also loved the way camera moved and the way and the way sets were designed.<br/><br/>The best scene in a Bike feat, the way Tintin hung to the wire just on handles, awesome. I loved it a lot and it was a laughter riot in theatre.<br/><br/>I would go with 4/5 for Tintin, this movie has to be watched for Haddock more than Tintin."

","When I heard about this project I was skeptical and worried that Hollywood is just going to cash in on it. Since it's a European comic, I expected that they are going to americanize the source material and take out the essence and taint some of my fondest childhood memories. That's why I ignored it when it was in the theater but recently I came around and bought the DVD. And now I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't go to see it in the first place. Spielberg and his writers were obviously fans of the comics and appreciated it for the same reasons I did and the result is phenomenal. Sure there are a few compromises here and there, in the story, in the characters and how it translates from comics to a 3D animated movie, but overall Tintin, Snowy, the Captain and Thompson and Thompson were just like I remembered them - only pity is that the Professor was absent, who was one of my favorites. The story itself is a blend of 3 comic albums and works great for a movie, really good pacing and a good mixture of mystery, adventure and simple fun. And even if you don't know the comics, the movie is a very good introduction to Tintin's adventures around the globe."
"martinlest","9","0","0","3 July 2014"," Loved it!
","I got to love Tintin when I lived in France. As far as I recall, there were Tintin cartoons on TV in the UK when I was a small child (late 60s?) and I certainly enjoyed them. But the books are truly, truly wonderful (as most reading this will know all too well already!). My French became pretty fluent as I lived in Paris and reading in the original language only added to the pleasure.<br/><br/>That said, I feel that those who are missing out on the pleasures of the film by comparing it with the books are, well, missing out! Of course it's almost a cliché, 'the film is a disappointing rendition of the book'. This may often be true, but usually only because people who have read the book obviously come to the movie with expectations: I saw all the Harry Potter films (on DVD), for instance, then (inspired by the experience) read all the books. Then I watched all the films again. The books win hands down (in spite of my admiration for Daniel Radcliffe). But my impressions of the films were influenced the second time around by remembering the books. I liked them better on my first go. But I am stating the obvious here....<br/><br/>So, all these comparisons with the 'bandes désinées', whilst understandable, are a bit of a red herring (or do I mean. a 'red haddock'?) IMHO. Yes, the film has some things I didn't get (too much Haddock and not enough Tintin, I agree) But watch the film as an artwork (and it is that, I think) in its own right and how can you not love it?"
"cleary-joshua","8","0","0","2 June 2014"," Spielberg goes back to his roots with an Indiana Jones style adventure movie...
","With films like ""Duel"" and ""Jaws"", Steven Spielberg perfected the 'high concept thriller' – movies that could really be summed up in one sentence. Over time, he moved onto more personal dramas, and then at the start of the 2000s, futuristic science fiction. Most of the time he's extremely successful in finding new genres, but it often feels far departed from his original ideas. With ""The Adventures of Tintin"", he goes back to his roots with an Indiana Jones style adventure featuring everyone's favourite boy detective. It's visually stunning, extremely exciting and a movie for all ages.<br/><br/>The film follows Tintin, played by former 'Billy Elliot', Jamie Bell, on a quest involving a sunken ship – the Unicorn. Along the way, he meets drunken ship's captain, Captain Haddock, played by motion-capture pioneer Andy Serkis, and the villainous Ivan Sakharine, played by Daniel Craig. The adventure takes them all over the world, to different locations and landscapes, which are all visually exciting and provide for great action sequences. We later discover that Haddock and Sakharine's rivalry goes back generations, and there are some fantastic scenes which show the two's ancestors fighting just as the two are now. The supporting cast is also great, especially the choice of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thompson.<br/><br/>What makes this unique as a Spielberg film is the use of motion-capture animation, a new realm for the director. He takes to it extremely well, embracing the visual possibilities that it presents and allowing him to direct the camera towards the action straight away. In numerous chase scenes, the excitement comes partly through the chaotic camera-work, in scenes that would not be possible in live-action. He can give you different perspectives, particularly those of Tintin's dog, Snowy, and much more easily give you information that the protagonists don't have.<br/><br/>The script is extremely sharp and often very funny, making this well-paced adventure even more enjoyable. It never feels slow, always taking the adventure to a new place with a new lead which is just as interesting as the previous one. The scene on the plane and fight sequence on the old ship are particularly enjoyable. The one problem the film has is its ending, which is far too sudden a cliffhanger, and doesn't leave the events of the movie resolved enough to be satisfying. It would work much better if there was a firm finale to one case, which leads to an even bigger plot for the inevitable sequel. This is partially what the writers attempted, but it's not complete enough to work. The very fact that a sequel is being made excites me, however, since this is a constantly enjoyable adventure movie, which does justice to Hergé's original comics."

","Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) and his loyal dog Snowy are sitting for a portrait in Paris. Behind them, clever folks are pickpocketing a good deal of the crowd. After taking delight in his picture, Tintin finds something else to love. It's a model ship and its selling for a song. Strange what happens next. Just as the lad makes the purchase, not one but two gentlemen try to buy the ship from its now owner but Tintin won't do it. He takes it home, finds out its name and goes to the library for research. When Tintin and Snowy return, the ship is gone! This leads to finding the estate of the original ship's owner, another model, and the kidnapping of Tintin and his dog! Soon, they are at sea and the captain is after a part of the model that Tintin didn't know he lost! The lad escapes with a drunken sailor and goes hither and yon, trying to get back to Paris and avoid the nasty men who are after him. Will a boy and his dog have the advantage? They will when they are as smart as these two! There's really nothing so bad about this film, so the director, Spielberg, hasn't committed a sinsin. But, it is complex and not really a younger children's flick at all. That said, it is sensational to look at, with a design that is bright and colorful. Also, the actors voicing the characters, including Bell, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, are first rate, too. The film also starts off quite action packed but loses a bit of steam in the middle before finishing nicely. Especially fine is a scene where an opera singer shatters the glass of everything in sight. So, older kids and folks that are young at heart, especially longtime fans of Tintin, will like it. But, it has to be called good, not great."

","I'm a huge Tintin fan (the books) and have read those books over and over again and I know them like the back of my hands. I've been so excited to watch the movie since it was announced.<br/><br/>Whether it's brilliant or not, I have mixed feelings.<br/><br/>First of all, Spielberg and Jackson are among my favorites and yes they have done a good job. The film is very entertaining and the animation is remarkable. You can be satisfied with the movie and think it was worth your money. However as a hardcore Tintin fan I didn't like the fact they changed the story and even the characters. I felt that Tintin's and Captain Haddock's personalities were extremely different from the books. They have changed them to bring humor, entertainment and even flow to the changed storyline. I also felt they went overboard with trying to make the movie funny.<br/><br/>Beside those issues which I'm sure I'm the only one who has them with this movie as a fan of the books, it did not feel like a waste of time.

"Turfseer","5","0","0","2 September 2013"," Adults will dig all the 3D motion capture technical wizardry but its narrative is best viewed by prepubescent boys
","'The Adventures of Tintin' has been described as a ""3D motion capture computer-animated epic adventure."" Like many Spielberg productions, the story represents a hearkening back to yesteryear. It's similar to Spielberg's 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' series, in that it involves a search for lost treasure, in the spirit of the old radio and movie serials. It also involves the struggle between a clear cut noble protagonist and calculating, villainous antagonist.<br/><br/>I never really was able to figure out how old Tintin, the young journalist protagonist, is supposed to be. Somehow probably between 16 and possibly 22. Anyway, the plot is not overly complicated. Tintin buys a model ship, the Unicorn, at a flea market and it's actually one of three models, that contain a scroll. When pieced together, the three scrolls, reveal the location of sunken treasure. <br/><br/>Tintin's model ship is stolen by Sakharine, the antagonist, who later is revealed to be a descendant of Red Rackham, a pirate who attempted to gain possession of the actual 17th century ship, The Unicorn; but he ends up being thwarted by the ship's captain, Sir Francis Haddock, who intentionally sank The Unicorn, in order to prevent Rackham from taking possession of the treasure on board. It turns out that Haddock's descendant, Captain Haddock, is manning an old freighter, which Sakharine takes over by inducing a mutiny amongst the ship's crew, in order to pilot it to Bagghar, a fictional port city in colonial French Morocco, where he intends to steal the third model ship, from a powerful, well-to-do sheik. <br/><br/>Where 'Tintin' really takes off is in the deliriously choreographed 3D motion capture computer-animated sequences. There's a chase involving Silk, a pickpocket, in late 40s (?) or early 50s (?) Brussels, who has stolen Tinton's scroll from Unicorn #1. Then there's another great sequence where Tinton and a drunken Haddock escape the freighter in a lifeboat and eventually make their way to Morocco in a stolen seaplane. If that isn't enough, Sakharine steals the third scroll during an operatic concert for the Sheikh, given by a woman who reminded me of Margaret Dumont (from the Marx Brothers). Finally, there's a great chase scene, where the good guys finally apprehend Sakharine.<br/><br/>'Tintin' falls flat in its attempt to be periodically humorous. There are two Scotland Yard detectives, Thompson and Thompson, who are too inept to be funny and then there's Captain Haddock, whose drunk act, proves ultimately tiresome. Tintin himself simply doesn't have enough idiosyncrasies to be a compelling protagonist, and comes across as a generic sleuth. What really kills 'Tintin' in terms of narrative, is the lack of a romantic interest for Tintin or at least some kind of female foil, that could spark things up. Tintin has a lot of action for prepubescent boys, but adults will probably find quite a bit of this stuff, simply juvenile. I recommend Tintin for all the technical wizardry, but the target audience is really best suited for ages eight through twelve!"
"bob the moo","Null","0","0","1 September 2013"," Weak on suspense, plotting, atmosphere and characters but has some great set-pieces and is enjoyable for its constant movement and noise
","Like many others, I grew up on the Tintin books although I didn't really have strong feelings about this film one way or the other; I didn't see the character as something to be protected nor something to get excited about seeing in a film, although I was interested. Happy to wait till I could get it at home (and then some) I watched this recently and did so with the knowledge that the commercial and critical response to the film's release last year maybe hadn't been all everyone was hoping. The plot sees Tintin buying a model ship that several people seem very keen to get their hands on. This simple purchase leads to murder and soon he is caught up in a race to uncover treasure before the mysterious Sakharine can find it first.<br/><br/>The film offers a decent story with core parts of it coming directly from the original books but mostly it doesn't do a great job of delivering it. There isn't a strong base to the plot and there isn't really anything that made me invest in what I was watching. This was ironically caused by what the film did pretty well, which was to deliver near constant movement. The film does have some very well constructed and delivered set-pieces which flow really well and look great in terms of the spectacle and the way the ""camera"" moves around them. There is the problem that there is almost too many of them and at times the film feels too frantic and with too little peril or investment. It is not because it is animated, it can happen with films where the characters just seem to never really be in danger. It is very good as a family- friendly action movie though and although I found it not to be particularly memorable, I did find it enjoyably light and fluid.<br/><br/>The animation is quite amazing in terms of how realistic it looks. There is still a very odd look to the characters, where they are realistic enough to forget they are animated but not so realistic that they stop looking a little bit weird. This would have maybe been a problem if the film spent long on the characters but to be honest it all moves so fast we're never lingering long on the characters. The voice work is OK but most of them struggle because they don't have a lot of character or fun dialogue – even Haddock is a little less colorful than I expected. Bell and Serkis are solid while Pegg and Frost are perhaps a bit too obvious. I liked Craig as the villain as he had something about him as a character which was added to by the voice-work, but mostly this seemed to be a film about movement and as a result the performances never seemed particularly important.<br/><br/>Tintin got a bit of a bad reception but it is a perfectly fine family film with some great set-pieces and plenty of movement. It is weaker when it comes to suspense, tension, plotting and characters and it is hard not to see those having an impact, but generally it is enjoyable for what it is."
"cat_ranchero","7","0","0","27 December 2012"," Good in parts...
","It's all very well made with state of the art animation and motion capture to the fore. All the performances were very good with Andy Serkis standing out as Captain Haddock. It did, however, feel like a series of set pieces stitched together by a rather flimsy adventure story. Far too much is left to coincidence for anything to be credible I'm afraid, which is probably why I wasn't really a fan of the Tintin stories in the first place. Over all, it didn't quite work for me; however, I would be interested to see what they do with the next instalment.<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDED (Just)<br/><br/>My score: 6.9/10<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","To be honest, I didn't exactly read the Tintin comics this movie was going to be based on, but at least I went to see this in theaters in 3D with my sister, her boyfriend, and my brother to see if it would really make us feel excited. After the film progressed and ended, it did and boy were we impressed. While the movie isn't a masterpiece, it's a great homage to the first three Tintin comics I've recently read (I've read them a few months later and thought they were good, too).<br/><br/>However, I will admit that it does have two flaws that ruined the film for me. I liked the original concept of the story's usage of the first three comics, but it included too many characters and the comedy, while funny, could've been timed better. At least I do enjoy Thomson and Thompson's hilarious moments especially in the beginning of the film. Aside from it's flaws, it has some redeeming qualities including the brisk pacing, it's spectacular visuals and the CGI faces on Tintin, Haddock, and the others were exactly like the ones from the comics. The characters are well-developed and the relationship between Tintin and Haddock was terrific. The villain is great with some great enthusiastic voice work from Daniel Craig. Other voice actors like Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Simon O'Pegg did great and portrayed the main characters and the comedic sidekicks perfectly.<br/><br/>The strongest aspect goes to the fantastic action sequences and the music from John Williams, although not one of his best in a movie so far, is beyond memorable it ranks with his music from the Indiana Jones movies.

","Young optimist and detailed reporter TinTin (Jamie Bell) comes across a model ship named the Unicorn in a small market at the center of the town. Supposedly, this ship was commanded by Sir Francis Haddock, was carrying a secret cargo and was lost at sea following a battle against a band of pirates headed by Red Rackam. Centuries later, TinTin discovers a clue inside the model ship that he purchases that could lead to the finding of the treasure of all treasures! However, little to his knowledge, there are three model ships of the Unicorn, with each of them containing a piece of the clue that leads to the treasure, and Red Rackham's ancestor known as Sakharine (Daniel Craig) is also in search of the discovery as well. Coming to realize that Sakharine is indeed a villain and will do whatever it takes to find the treasure first, TinTin and his faithful dog Snowy seek the help of the last remaining ancestor of Sir Francis Haddock known as Captain Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis), and together, all three of them must race against time, overwhelming odds and many foes in order to seek out and claim the bountiful treasure that belonged to none other than Sir Francis Haddock himself!<br/><br/>Based upon the famous children's series from Herge by the same name, ""The Adventures of TinTin in 3D!"" is a 2011 motion capture film that is directed by Steven Spielberg (War Horse), produced by Kathleen Kennedy (Jurassic Park) and Peter Jackson (King Kong, 2005) and has a movie soundtrack by composer John Williams (Catch Me If You Can). The film stars Jamie Bell (Breakdown), Andy Serkis (13 Going On 30), Daniel Craig (Casino Royale, 2006), Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead) and Simon Pegg (Star Trek, 2009). ""The Adventures of TinTin in 3D!"" was released through Paramount Pictures, Amblin Entertainment, Columbia Pictures and Nickelodeon Movies. ""The Adventures of TinTin in 3D!"" (2011), for a motion capture film, is a really good attempt! Here is my official movie review.<br/><br/>First of all, although I thought the stories were interesting, I am not a fan of the two motion capture films that Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future) helmed; including ""The Polar Express in 3D!"" (2004) and ""A Christmas Carol in 3D!"" (2009). However, I feel that director Steven Spielberg did a great job with ""The Adventures of TinTin in 3D!"" (2011). The motion capture sequences of the film were extraordinary, and the detail was breathtaking as well! The background music was decently placed, and there was a good mixture of both a story and character development to boot. Even for an Animated film, this movie really pulls you in and holds your interest quite well. The voice-over acting performances by the main leads, and the supporting roles as well, were quite entertaining if I do say so myself.<br/><br/>However, I do feel that Steven Spielberg could have done with less comical scenes throughout the movie; including a scene involving one of the characters spinning round and round by means of a propeller, and also a scene where a hotel building literally slides down the road in a small town, carrying two men inside. In my opinion, the other flaw of this movie is that the running time could have been a little bit longer. I understand that this movie was designed with a children's audience in mind, but the general public and film critics alike could have used a slightly longer and more explained movie at times as well. With these minor flaws in mind, ""The Adventures of TinTin in 3D!"" (2011) was an enjoyable and thrill-seeking adventure that definitely held my interest throughout the entire picture! This film is intended for a children's audience, yes, but teenagers and adults could and will enjoy this project as well. Overall, congratulations to the cast and crew of ""The Adventures of TinTin in 3D!"" (2011).<br/><br/>""The Adventures of TinTin in 3D!"" (2011): Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Sonje Fortag, Toby Jones and Daniel Mays.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 star rating."

","The first motion-capture adventure into the world of blond-haired blue-eyed reporter Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell), Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and fox terrier Snowy throws us into the remarkable secret of the Unicorn. Engulfed by the fantastic imagination of Belgian artist Georges Remi we travel the world by sea, by plane or by foot, traversing through vast waters, deadly deserts or the mysteries of the streets of London. All in search of a treasure map leading to the gold from the Unicorn, the sunken ship of Sir Francis Haddock. Along the way evildoer Sakharine (Daniel Craig) attempts to foil the youngster's plan and claim glory for himself.<br/><br/>A spectacular and engaging experience in computer enhanced animation based on tremendous motion capture trumps ""Avatar"" given its vastly superior story and likable characters. Pinned down to perfection every scene is a feast for the eye, unremittingly fast-paced and entertaining. Be it following the exploits of a wrist-happy kleptomaniac in a London market or a duel between 20 metre high cranes Tintin never drops a beat delivering on a promise of high-octane adventure.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg manages to keep Tintin as fresh as cuisine sushi, destined for the household of every movie-lover irrespective of age, race or back-ground. Nonetheless Tintin fails to grasp the animal magnetism of his soul-mate Indiana Jones, while the boyish charm does wear thin with time, albeit this is thankfully counterpointed with the drunkard crass character of Captain Haddock, who ignites immediate engagement. Nonetheless the love affair with perfection does have its downsides, as the story delivers an overdose of action, leaving a sense of fulfilment of expectations about half-way through the movie and a lingering hope for final credits soon after. The story itself is essential fun, but wanton of unexpected thrills given the limited charm of the title character. A clash with destiny on the future of filmmaking is nonetheless an unabashed success, albeit one fraught with the stigma of pure unabated enjoyment bereft of deeper content. Nonetheless Spielberg rides his storm with pizazz delivering us into an ultimately charming world of adventure and fun straight from the drawings of Remi."

You hit a wall, you push through it."" – Captain Haddock.<br/><br/>Check out my full review at: http://reelstorymovies.blogspot.com/2012/04/adventures-of-tintin.html<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's computer animated children's movie, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a fun, thrill ride, which is suitable for older kids and adults all the same. The movie, fashioned from the most popular European comics in the 20th century, is a dazzling rendition of the famous Belgian artist Georges Remi (1907–1983), who published the series of comic albums under the pen name of Hergé.<br/><br/>As far as source material is concerned, Spielberg's adaptation of Remi's famous work revolves around the story of meeting, and then collaborating with the drunken, and kidnapped Captain Haddock, who has had his ship taken from him after a mutiny.<br/><br/>The classic Tintin character, Captain Haddock, played by Andy Serkis, escapes with Tintin and snowy (his white fox terrier dog) and embark on an adventure together to find Captain Haddock's grandfather's sunken treasure on the Unicorn.<br/><br/>The tale is engaging and exciting. It was well-directed and was filled with suspense. The action scenes, while implausible and hearkening back to Spielberg's days directing Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, draw you into the fantasy world unfolding on the screen.<br/><br/>The most impactful point of the movie is when it appears like all hope is lost. The bad guys have gotten away with the secret message Haddock left, Tintin and Haddock are stranded, and Haddock gives a rousing speech to encourage Tintin to push through this ""wall"" they face: ""Failed. There are plenty of others willing to call you a failure. A fool. A loser. A hopeless souse. Don't you ever say it of yourself. You send out the wrong signal, that is what people pick up. Don't you understand? You care about something, you fight for it. You hit a wall, you push through it. There's something you need to know about failure, Tintin. You can never let it defeat you.""<br/><br/>While the animation is similar to any other animated film, it lacks Hergé's signature ligne claire style, which characterized his comics. Tintin is easily recognizable by his red hair, and the front which sticks up, but Hergé's signature style is largely absent in the animation of Tintin.<br/><br/>Tintin and Haddock's ""stick-to-it-ness"" is a highlight of the movie as they endure impossible odds, are faced with countless detours and missteps, yet continue on in their pursuit of the goal.<br/><br/>It reminds me a lot of the Christian life. That it is a marathon, not a sprint. That there are ups and downs, there are failures and successes, and to continue to run the race, pursue the goal, that is key. That is and will always be the point: to never give up and to continue on until the end.<br/><br/>In Philippians 3, Paul urges his fellow followers of Jesus to press on, like him, even a great apostle who has planted several churches with great results. He tells the Philippians: Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. - Philippians 3:12-14<br/><br/>As Christians today, we need to follow Paul's example. We need to exhibit this same type of never give up, never say die attitude that Captain Haddock spurs Tintin on to, even when it looks like all hope is lost.<br/><br/>I also liked the team that Haddock, Tintin, and little snowy, formed as Haddock was a lost and drunken soul, desiring adventure and purpose, and snowy was a little dog, but both played a very important role in the trio finding what they sought: treasure.<br/><br/>In order for us, as Christians, to go the distance we need each other. We need people to keep us focused on what really matters. We need those around us to encourage us to continue when we are ready to give up. We need someone to tell us that we can do it and we must go on, and not let us settle for failure.<br/><br/>Haddock's word ring true for us too in this life: ""There's something you need to know about failure, you can never let it defeat you.""<br/><br/>My Score – Overall Rating: 8.25 out of 10 Plot: 9 out of 10 Character Development: 7 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Audio/Visuals: 8 out of 10"

They left the movie open for a sequel, resulting in a somewhat dull anticlimax. The movie was very exciting and thoroughly enjoyable, but I left feeling a bit disappointed, due to the blunt and boring ending. All the action seems to happen, and then we are left with this action-less, dull climax to wrap everything up, and it does the movie as a whole no good.<br/><br/>Apart from the ending though, this movie is exciting, funny and an overall quality film. I recommend this to anyone, as the vast majority of this film is superb, but I did leave feeling somewhat disappointed with the ending.<br/><br/>But maybe that's just my bad feelings for sequels.

In my eyes that makes the film a success, the characters of Tintin (and Snowy), Captain Haddock, Thomson and Thompson are almost identical to my memories from childhood, a joy to watch. Several people have commented on the accents not being European but when I imagined the characters talking whilst reading the stories, they were talking in English accents. <br/><br/>Speaking of voice actors, every cast member (Jamie Bell, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Andy Serkis) is on form, delivering joy and menace appropriately. Jamie Bell in particular gives his Tintin the sense of youthful adventure that I imagined he would do.<br/><br/>The story is a combination of several of the Tintin books and whilst the pacing is uneven at times, the story is a nice mix of adventure and danger. The first third of the film is fantastic, the initial set-up, introduction to characters and the plot as a whole are very well done, add to this a fantastic opening title sequence (think Catch Me If You Can) and it draws you right in. Whilst the rest of the film doesn't live up to these inspired first minutes, it certainly holds its own and has that kind of Spielberg magic where it just has a slightly magical feel to it.<br/><br/>Read more at: http://thegiff.typepad.com/film_flare/"

","Courageous reporter Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock set off on a treasure hunt for three scrolls hidden within a model ships while fending off the villainous Sakharine.<br/><br/>There's something delightfully wonderful about the visual experience that Steven Spielberg's Tintin offers yet it is still a stilted adventure. Based on Hergé's comic book series Tintin is a celebrated European character (much like Asterix the Gaul which would be amazing if produced in the same medium). John Williams gives a solid yet Indiana Jones sounding score. The characters are wonderfully faithful and the detailed CGI cast really capture their spirit successfully. There is an array of famous actors Jamie Bell(Tintin), Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig to name a few and their voices and movement really bring the characters to life.<br/><br/>It's an immense first outing for Tintin, although like Spielberg's use of the motion capture technology, it feels like it's trying to find its feet. You can't but help feel that the first instalment may have fared better under Jackson's direction (given his experience with the technology) overlooked by Steven's watchful eye. Then have Spielberg direct the next one. However, it wasn't meant to be. With all the focus on the action there is little mystery that Tintin is renowned for and while the action is wonderful along with the slapstick comedy there's something missing that writers Moffat, Wright and Cornish exclude and that is a true sense of mystery.<br/><br/>Although it has some awe-inspiring set ups it is just not as fun or as intriguing as you'd possibly expect given Hergé's source material."

","The Adventures of Tintin<br/><br/>Belgian journalists must be the most relaxed members of the world media, since nothing noteworthy ever happens in Belgium.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, however, the reporter in this animated-adventure has plenty of article fodder outside of new waffle toppings.<br/><br/>When a model ship he picked up at a bazaar becomes the object of the pirate descendant Red Rackham's (Daniel Craig) pursuit, the young scribe, Tintin (Jamie Bell) and his dog Snowy, set off on a journey to prevent Rackham from obtaining the other ships.<br/><br/>Along the way, Tintin teams with a drunken sea captain, Haddock (Andy Serkis), whose ancestors first battled Rackham's water-rat relatives over now-sunken treasure.<br/><br/>Based on the comic book series by Hergé, this Steven Spielberg helmed motion-capture version not only captures the characters perfectly, but also the rip roarin' adventure synonymous with the brand.<br/><br/>Hopefully, it spawns other European comic book film adaptations, like, say, Amsterdam's Red Light District Defenders.

","Tintin is a young European journalist who also solves crimes. After buying a model ship, he becomes involved in a mystery about a pirate treasure and finds his life is in danger.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. The motion capture technique is fascinating and so well done. Some characters look cartoonish while others look very real; the scenery is strikingly beautiful. The action-packed story is part pirate swashbuckler and part Indiana Jones adventure; the combination makes for a spectacular and exciting film with a sweet, smart, and very likable young man at its center.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, especially for adults, and you don't have to be familiar with the graphic novel source material to enjoy it."

","Picasso said 'Good artists borrow, great artists steal."" There's a lot of borrowing in this film. When, the opening credits rolled on Tin Tin, I inwardly groaned. John William's score and the title sequence were a rip-off of 'Catch Me If You Can'. Spielberg's own rip-off of 1960's title sequences. <br/><br/>Spielberg (and Williams) repeat themselves in this movie, but there is enough that is new and fresh to save the day. If you remind yourself that this movie is intended for an audience that may not have seen all the clichés that are used, it is quite a good movie. <br/><br/>First and foremost, the animation is stunning. It manages to cut a line between comic book and realism that is fresh without feeling contrived. Your mind's eye comfortably settles into this world. The effects are subtle and effective. The back of a hand morphs into a desert dune. A desert dune morphs into an ocean wave, all beautifully done. <br/><br/>The story incorporates 3 Tin Tin books in rather seamless fashion. The core relationship, that between Tin Tin and Captain Haddock (both beautifully voiced by Jamie Bell and Andy Serkis) rings true. <br/><br/>John William's score, while cutting no new ground, serves this adventure as well as the score in Indiana Jones. In fact, there is not a lot to separate them. <br/><br/>But if you forgive these gents from repeating themselves and look at the film with new eyes, it's really a very fine and entertaining work. Seen it before? Yes. Seen it done better? Not really."

","""The adventures of Tintin"" was destined to be a 10/10 with its sublime graphics & animations (it is simply staggering) which sets a new visual benchmark for all animated movies to come. The characters are very well researched, Spielberg has captured each and every character's traits to the most minute detail. From the main protagonist Tintin down to even the secondary thugs and goons are in keeping with the main franchise. Thomson & Thompson are exceptionally hilarious & Captain Haddock is captured perfectly from ""the crab with the golden claws"". The direction is superb, as we have grown to expect from Mr. Spielberg, and so is the voice acting (Jamie Bell in my opinion is the only human being alive who can bring life to the beloved character of Tintin). The movie was made with an obvious love for Tintin and all the magic it wove over the years. <br/><br/>That being said I gave this movie a 8/10, simply because of the story line and the love-hate relationship it gave me. Do not get me wrong it is by no means sloppy, but I just wished that Mr. Spielberg would have stayed a little bit truer to the original franchise rather than trying to mesh ""the secret of the unicorn"" & ""the crab with the golden claws"" together. Doing so they have omitted key aspects of both stories (for example the Bird brothers are nowhere to be seen except in the opening sequence, there is no mention of the drug smuggling ring) & have created loopholes in the story (since he hasn't met Captain yet Tintin buys the model Unicorn for himself but the problem is he immediately knows there is a story behind it just because 2 more people were interested in buying it - sounds a bit ridiculous to me) & sequences where the lovers of the original franchise go ""Oh! no"". However there are modifications to the story that I loved. The move to make Mr. Sakharine the villain and a descendant of Red Rackham was in my opinion a genius move. I also loved all the new action sequences. However I just wished that the creators just picked one story and stuck with it.<br/><br/>I grew up with Tintin books by my side. I know each and every story by Herge like the back of my hand. So I maybe a little bit prejudiced and may sound like an old fart when I say that ""The adventures of Tintin"" could have been a masterpiece but sadly falls short.<br/><br/>However I am grateful for Mr. Spielberg for giving a fading hero a beginning he deserves..."
"jd-mstr1","8","0","0","4 March 2012"," Fun and Exciting: Now This Is A Blockbuster
","There are many reasons that The Adventures of Tintin works; the main reason is Steven Spielberg. Yes, the film is based off a European comic strip, created by Herge; however, Spielberg brings it to life in only the way Spielberg can. He adds some exciting elements to the film that take a decent storyline and elevate into a whole lot of fun.<br/><br/>Tintin follows a boy named Tintin, who lives in England. He begins the film by buying a model ship. The model ship contains secrets to a hidden treasure, and after a series of events, Tintin decides to find the treasure. While the storyline is nicely written, it's been done before, and the writers do little to make it seem fresh. What shines in Tintin, instead, is the sub-plots. Each one is well crafted, and I found myself enjoying the different parts to it. In the end, the sub-plots come together to turn a boring/average story into a pretty good one.<br/><br/>What takes the film to the next level after the sub-plots is Spielberg's direction. He is a master of creating scenes that can manipulate the audience's emotions. Some dislike him for that; I'm not one of them. In Tintin, Spielberg brilliantly uses motion capture and animation to give us some truly exciting scenes. My favorite is a fascinating one-shot chase in Morroco. This scene proves why animation and motion-capture are important elements to a film, such a scene could not be accomplished if the film was made in live-action.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I found myself hoping for a little more from Tintin. The movie was fun, but it wasn't at the same level as Spielberg's Indiana Jones films, which take the action/adventure genre to a whole new level. I think part of the reason why Jones succeeds more is that the story lines, while being basic, are told very well in the films. More importantly, the characters-especially Indiana Jones-are richer than Tintin. If these elements can be corrected in the sequel (assuming there is one) then Tintin 2 will be a great movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Tintin was a fun and exciting ride. It might not be perfect, but it entertains us the way a film should. I give it an 8 out of 10!"

","When it comes to bringing the character of Tintin alive on screen even the best of Hergé's fans would not dispute that the project was in safe hands of the creative genius Spielberg. And to top it up with 3D, makes it better than the best. <br/><br/>The grandeur and glory is undoubtedly at its best, however it leaves more to desire as you walk out of the cinemas. The narrative sways in pattern of troughs and crests. And the flashbacks which are far-too-many ensure it hits the bump at regular intervals. The 3D visuals might hold attention but after a while the novelty wears thin. The lighter moments of Haddock and Thompson Brothers seems to have failed to translate on screen. <br/><br/>To put in simple words, you fail to get that Pixar feeling (blistering barnacles!)."

You just wish these guys who can pour unfathomable sums of money into a film could make it a little more engaging. I guess showering a screenwriter with gold coins ain't necessarily gonna pay off the way pouring money into the animation would.

","Next to chocolate and waffles, Tintin is one of Belgium's greatest exports, a character beloved by millions all over the world. Now, Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson have taken on the challenge of bringing the young reporter to motion-captured life.<br/><br/>Tintin (Jamie Bell) is a successful and famous journalist who has worked on a number of high-profile stories. He stumbles into a new adventure when he buys a model ship that drops him into a historical mystery involving sunken treasure and a centuries-long feud between two families. Along the way, he has to stop the dastardly Sakharine (Daniel Craig), find the clues to the treasure and work with the alcoholic Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), who must reclaim his ancestor's treasure and lift a curse that has plagued his family.<br/><br/>The casting is absolutely pitch-perfect throughout. Bell and Serkis truly are Tintin and Haddock, a chalk-and-cheese relationship with Tintin as the man who has to keep Haddock on the straight and narrow. Tintin possesses more of a deadpan intelligence, whereas Haddock is a reactionary bruiser. Craig too makes a great villain; his voice was almost unrecognisable throughout as he ruthlessly fulfills his ancestors' tradition of thievery. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost continue their great double act as the bumbling detectives Thompson and Thompson. Snowy the pup will easily challenge Gromit and Milo (from The Mask) for best movie dog.<br/><br/>From the getgo, there are plenty of homages and references to other ""Tintin"" stories that will please fans. Spielberg shows respect for the material, for the most part, while still make a movie the whole family can enjoy. It's a historical and modern mystery with a family feud, a treasure hunt, international adventure and bits of action-comedy tossed in.<br/><br/>This light romp matches the tone and style of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade with plenty of homages to previous Spielberg films. Spielberg kept the period setting and uses a film noir style for the city scenes, fitting for the classic look of old cars, clothes and guns. This movie is a proper, old-fashioned adventure that takes Tintin and Haddock to exotic locations that would have still been a mystery in the 1930s. It was particularly impressive during a sequence when the movie flashes back and forth between the present to a pirate battle in the 17th Century in terms of how it was cut together. The entire production was action-packed, exciting and comic.<br/><br/>The comedy of ""Tintin"" was mostly physical, slapstick or revolved around Haddock's alcoholism (because alcoholism is always funny). There are some witty lines and jokes for older audiences, but there are a couple of jokes involving burping when you would expect Spielberg and ""Tintin"" to be above that.<br/><br/>We all know that previous full motion capture films have failed to impress. But The Adventures of Tintin delivers with realistic little details such as freckles along cartoonish features. Because of the animated world, Spielberg was not limited by the realities of a practical filmmaker and came up with really impressive action sequences throughout. He certainly knows action and it is impressive that the effects in ""Tintin"" were more realistic than in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull."

","... is clearly gripping the viewers who have reviewed this film before me. I've never read a line of the Tintin books so I had no strong feelings either way; I have seen a couple of Spielberg films but again found them fairly ho hum. Nevertheless I decided to give this one a shot but it might have been a shot of strong liquor because I kept nodding off. This is not to say it was bad but clearly it wasn't that good. Unlike some posters the three D didn't bother me but neither did it enhance what seemed a fairly bland plot and I found myself straining a little too hard to discern the actors behind the effects. If I hadn't known, for example, that Andy Serkis was playing the old sea dog I'd have been hard put to get beyond the bulbous nose - I've seen Serkis on stage in London several times before he became well known, often in small theatres where one is close to the stage - and I still don't know who Daniel Craig was. On the other hand many posters have stated that this is a fine example of a 'family' film and I'll go along with that."
"Joejoesan","Null","14","68","11 October 2011"," Nice movie, but surely not the next Indiana Jones
","After Mars needs moms I thought that making computer movies with 'realistic' humans in it, was a bad idea. But here is another attempt, this time by movie legend Steven Spielberg and the Lord of the Rings himself, Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>As we all know The adventures of Tintin was a billion years in the making. After Raiders of the Lost Ark someone told Spielberg that there were a lot of similarities between Indiana Jones and a European comic hero called Tintin. So the filmmaker bought the movierights, lost them and eventually obtained them again to make this first Tintin movie.<br/><br/>In the comics Tintin is a young reporter who travels all around the world to chase after a good story. He has visited Russia, Tibet, Africa, the Middle-East and even Nazi-Germany. The first comic was published in 1930. And although the kids don't read the comics anymore, almost all European grownups know this hero. Tintin's best friends are a white dog named Snowy and a noisy sailor called Captain Haddock. And he gets a lot of help from two rather clumsy Interpol agents, Thomson and Thomson. In the Spielberg movie these characters also appear. In fact, the director stays pretty true to the comics.<br/><br/>After the first trailer I wasn't anxious to see The adventures of Tintin on the big screen. But after the German TV-commercial which showed a lot of action, my hopes for an unforgettable movie event began to rise. Does Spielberg still have the magic to make something incredible and make full use of the computer effects?<br/><br/>Unfortunately the answer to that question is no. The adventures of Tintin is good fun, that's true. But I don't think it will live up to the big hype. The story begins when Tintin buys a model ship, the Unicorn,on a market. Turns out it contains a secret message that will lead to the search of a lost treasure. Tintin gets kidnapped, gets acquainted with captain Haddock, travels to Morocco and finds out what villain is behind all this and why he wants to have his revenge on the Maddock family. <br/><br/>The good things first. The visuals of The adventures of Tintin are truly stunning. The story takes place in the 1930s and has an old European city (Brussels? Paris?) with old pittoresque streets, a boat, airplane, desert, palaces and exotic Middle Eastern alleys in it. But even better: the computer animated characters look very convincing. I even think it's the best I've ever seen, although I guess they're not meant to be very realistic. All of them have a caricaturistic face, usually with a big nose or extra wrinkles. Contrary to the comics there's a lot of action in this movie. The best one was already seen in the German TV-commercial, that's when Tintin rides a motorcycle. Well done. There's also a great seabattle with pirates.<br/><br/>Okay, then the rest. What I didn't like about The adventures of Tintin was the hero itself. Actually he's quite dull. Unlike Indiana Jones he doesn't have any rough edges. He can fight alright, but you know he will never play it dirty. Tintin has an angelic face that tells you he will never be harmed or injured. There goes the suspense! Thanks to framed newspaper clips on the wall of his living room we get to know that Tintin is a very successful reporter who has written several important stories. But why couldn't Spielberg tells us that with some pre-story scene like in Raiders of the Lost Arc? That would have worked much better. <br/><br/>Captain Haddock is much more interesting though. He starts out as a alcohol addict and even stays that way. But he's funny as hell. Great voice performance by Andy Serkis. Even Tintin's dog Snowy is more exciting than Tintin. <br/><br/>The story doesn't work either. It keeps being pushed forward by Tintin saying: ""Wait a minute, now I understand"" after he has decrypted another clue. The audience can't think along with the characters. They must accept that what they're saying is true and hope that something interesting or entertaining comes out of it. Although the story takes place around the same time as Indiana Jones and also has old motorcycles, planes and Middle Eastern streets in it, Tintin has little to do with our favourite adventurer. And that's bad, because I really was hoping that Spielberg had found a new kind of hero. The movie doesn't end with a bang but instead has some sort of cliffhanger. That didn't satisfy me at all. <br/><br/>The Adventures of Tintin is good fun. It has some nice scenes and especially captain Haddock and Tintin's dog Snowy are very funny. But both Spielberg and Jackson are talented enough to give us more than just 'good fun', aren't they?<br/><br/>I hope they'll do much better in the already planned sequel.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Leofwine_draca","2","3","9","2 January 2015"," A mo-cap mess
","This is a horrible film, but then I knew I'd hate it outright as I'm somebody who actively hates motion capture and who believes that CGI is the worst thing to happen to cinema. The only mo-cap film I didn't mind too much was BEOWULF, but that was more for the story than the execution; unfortunately, THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN takes everything a step backwards.<br/><br/>Spielberg has made a film for kids and kids alone. The humour is juvenile, the plot and characters simplistic in the extreme, and the acting is so mannered and manufactured that no adult would take it seriously. Jamie Bell's wooden Tintin is a charmless creation, still saddled with those dead eyes and carved wood expression that mo-cap results in. Still, Andy Serkis spares him the embarrassment of being the worst actor in the thing; I never could work out if Captain Haddock was supposed to be Scottish or Scandinavian, because Serkis is all over the place.<br/><br/>The story and characters only vaguely resemble the original comic books by Herge (of which I am a big fan) and most of it boils down to the kind of incessant, entirely routine CGI action that nowadays blights many a Hollywood movie. It's like Jackson's THE HOBBIT: THERE AND BACK AGAIN, with endless chase scenes and swooping camera angles; none of it means anything, there's no realism or danger, it's just bland and safe. It's no surprise that Jackson has his fingerprints all over this and, unfortunately, in Spielberg he's met his match as a purveyor of soulless entertainment. I'd love these guys to go back and make real films without relying on CGI all the while but I fear it will never happen."

The life-like yet animated feel of the movie impressed me. Plus, Steven Spielberg, Steven Moffat and Peter Jackson working on the same movie? C'mon. <br/><br/>It starts off somewhat dark, with suspicious characters and red herrings being introduced, alongside a mystery for our beloved Tintin to solve. It soon turns into a fun, comedy-filled, whirlwind of an adventure that has viewers at the edge of their seats. Adventures on the high sea, plane chases and a desert trek give the audience a delightful variety of scenes to keep them interested. The presence of comic relief characters, much like in the comics, Thompson & Thompson and Captain Haddock, provide a light-hearted atmosphere to the otherwise serious plot. Throw in amazing animation and CGI and you have a movie worth paying for. <br/><br/>I loved every minute of this movie. Every thing was so wonderfully woven together to form this positively delightful masterpiece. It was definitely a nostalgia trip for the adults in the audience, and a light-hearted adventure for the kids. 8/10."
"ElMaruecan82","9","3","9","30 October 2011"," A great adventure film for all the family. To be precise : a great family film for all the adventure...
","Steven Spielberg's ""Tintin and the Secret of the Unicorn"" is an entertaining action-packed and mystery-filled adventure film that, beyond all these epithets, respects the spirit of Herge's adventures of Tintin, the classic worldwide famous, comic-book series, and take this from a fan who grew up reading the albums, rereading them in French and English, and watching the animated features. In seven words : Steven Spielberg made a great Tintin movie.<br/><br/>Recently, I've been very critical toward Spielberg, but I knew he had a particular fondness on Tintin's stories, and you could tell by watching some of his films, the ""Indiana Jones"" series to say the least, remember Short Round in ""Temple of Doom"" who was inspired from Tintin's best friend Chang. Interestingly, Indy's profession as an archaeologist was as much as a convenient excuse for living exciting adventures as Tintin being a reporter (after all, we've never know for which newspaper he ever worked) but in this film, Tintin mentions his job several times, and his curiosity is less guided by a blind appetite for adventures than a strong and professionally oriented desire to know the secret of the Unicorn. Yes, he's an adventurer but his quest of the truth is what justifies the adventures, not the opposite. And the strength of the film is in its ability to be more a mystery than an adventure film.<br/><br/>Now, I'd like to get to the point that would inspire most criticism from the fans, or let's say, the most purist of them. For intellectual honesty's sake, or in the name of this Tintin-esque quest for the truth, I know some aspects will bother the hardcore fans. In fact, as it often happens for movies adapted from comic books, the story is a combination of many plots devices extracted from different albums. The problem is that the ""Secret of the Unicorn"" is only the first opus of a two-part story, the second being ""Red Rachkam Treasure"", which happens to be one of the most exciting and escapist of all Tintin's adventures, one of the funniest, and MY personal favorite. I was so impressed by the film that I wanted it to be followed by a sequel set overseas. But Spielberg chose to combine the story with the ""Golden Crab Claws"", the famous album where Tintin meets Captain Archibald Haddock.<br/><br/>The idea per se, isn't a blasphemy as long as it respects the spirit of ""Tintin"" stories, to those who remember the other Tintin films, many of them took shortcuts with the albums, while some of them, were based on original screenplays and not faithful to that unique ambiance exuded from the iconic comic-book series. Spielberg tactfully used the greatest elements of both albums with the redemption of Captain Haddock, turning from a drunken loser in the beginning to the proud, larger than life and ferocious descendant of the Knight François de Hadoque, famous for his epic outbursts of rage, his thundering typhoons and other blistering barnacles. As soon as Haddock makes his entrance, the movie takes a new dimension, with the growing complicity between the two characters as a heart-warming core.<br/><br/>Still, I can't help but feel frustrated for the underuse of ""Red Rackam Treasure"", which would have made one hell of a story. Especially for the whole twist that concludes the adventure, Spielberg's ""Secret of the Unicorn"" is less a treasure hunt than a treasure secret hunt so  why not make a sequel with the actual treasure hunt? Well, I try to reassure myself figuring that Spielberg might do another film involving seven crystal balls, Incas, or a red and white rocket flying to the moon, who knows? Or maybe he wanted the story that introduces Haddock, but ""Red Rackham""'s introduces us to Professor Cuthbert Calculus, who'd have been a better comic relief than Snowy or Thompson and Thomson. But let's no be so purist, comic-books have codes that movies don't have and vice versa, a director, and a Tintinologist like Spielberg is allowed to take some distances.<br/><br/>So, even, if the movie flirts sometimes with fantasy, or create many dizzying and exhilarating sequences begging for a 3D version, everything would have been pointless without the constant respect toward Herge's legacy. I appreciated that the film was clearly set in the 40's, which provides the perfect mood for such noir and exotic-set adventures, as much as I love the dazzling cinematography, and the inspirational message of the film. At the end, adults were thrilled, the Tintin fans were trying to recognize the subtle hints of other adventures, including a nice cameo-homage of Herge (will you catch him?), the non fans were enjoying a nice film, and children were laughing at the more slapstick parts, and Tintin's adventures had their shares of slapstick too. Not that it was funny every time, but there was the perfect dosage between action, fun, and remembrance of how great Tintin's comics have always been.<br/><br/>So, I'd like to thank Spielberg for having finally fulfilled his long-life dream. Now, we can finally say that Spielberg made a Tintin movie, which was the greatest reconciliation between two arts that seem to only unite for super heroic films. Tintin is another kind of hero, many will find him bland or asexual but this have always been Tintin's personality, a sort of idealistic exaltation of youth's adventurous spirit, but whatever ""boring"" you'd fin in that Yin, you have the Yang in Captain Haddock's colorful personality, and both contribute to one of the greatest dynamics that structure the film. The facial expressions are extraordinarily made, conveying Herge's particular 'clear line' style  they were drawn differently, but you could tell it was Tintin, Haddock and Snowy, on a pure technical achievement, the story is a success.<br/><br/>But on the field of storytelling, of thrills, and excitement, the film is a triumph that will delight the hearts of all the fans from 7 to 77."

While the arresting beauty of the animation will hold you sway for a while it cannot sustain the onerous weight of such an uninspired yarn on its own. Then to top it off it's a damn serial! So now I have to wait 3 years to find out if Tintin and Captain Haddock get the rest of the treasure? Sorry, I'm getting too old to wait around that long. I suspect this title will soon end up in the bargain bin."
"lionsroar91406","5","2","5","6 December 2011"," The Adventures of Tintin - A Little Thinthin
","One of the reasons I was interested in seeing this in the first place has to do with wanting to keep up. It's a little like reading a book you'd rather not just because everyone is talking about it. Given the stature of Spielberg and Jackson, I'm guessing this is a film people will be talking about. It's basically the same reason I went to see Avatar (2009). Going in I hoped that Tintin has more going for it than Cameron's Smurfs meets Dances With Wolves film of two years ago. At least I'm not already familiar with the plot points of Tintin, which is a plus and a chance for surprise. My one concern before I saw a frame of film was the possibility that I would experience the uncanny valley, wherein the animation looks too human for its own good. I can honestly say that once the film started the uncanny valley wasn't so much an issue as was why they shot this movie the way they did. Using motion capture, the actors played their parts, only to be animated over. This has been done many times before and while Tintin is far superior to The Polar Express, as a viewer I wondered why they didn't either animate it from the start or do a live action version of the story? What they ended up with is a hybrid that is sort of like watching cartoon characters walking about in the real world. I would have been happy if the entire film was animated in the same style as the opening credits. It wasn't shot this way to save money, as it reportedly cost $200 million. It comes off as stunt filmmaking, as in we can do it this way, so why not, rather than is this the best way to tell the story. Except for a few prosthetic noses, it's hard to know what about Tintin couldn't have been done as a live action film. I won't go in to the plot of Tintin, since it has not yet been in theaters, but it's somewhat convoluted plot has to do with lost treasure, cryptic clues and family feuds. And it is heavy on action, almost to the point of distraction. Spielberg doesn't seem to be satisfied with being the most commercially successful director of all time; he must also want to be known as the director with the most action per minute of film. This film almost makes the Indiana Jones franchise look like a walk in the park. There is one action sequence that frankly goes on so long your mind can start to wander. This is not to say that Tintin is all bad. Just that it could have been better. There are things that the film does well. Spielberg obviously knows his craft. The choice of shots and the way the humor is set up are good. But as with some of his films, story takes a backseat to the visual. And like Avatar, this is a very visual film. Sometimes, though, the film seems to be an extended cutscene from one of the Uncharted video games. The film comes dangerously close to assuming you're familiar with Tintin and that it doesn't need to set up the characters at all. Saved from the possibility of an exhaustive exposition sequence, the viewer is given no backstory for Tintin, save for a few visual clues. Again, having never read the comic, I don't know if Hergé never bothered to explain his past or that the filmmakers decided the viewers who didn't already know would want to research it on their own after seeing the movie. As an example, our only clue that Tintin is a boy is that everyone refers to him as such in the film. Otherwise, he could be a young-looking thirty for all we know. And this brings up a point about the marketing for this film. As consumers of pop culture we have become accustomed to long build ups for films, TV shows and video games and so I am somewhat surprised that there was not more of a push to get Tintin out into the public consciousness before releasing this very costly movie in America. Whether or not this will effect box office remains to be seen. It is also really hard to figure out how they chose the cast for this film. Since no one had to necessarily look like their parts why, as an example, cast Daniel Craig at all, when the characters he plays don't look like or even really sound like Daniel Craig? I have nothing against Craig as an actor, but it is hard to know what he brings to the role that others couldn't, since he literally disappears on screen. I'm not surprised that Andy Serkis is prominently used. After all Peter Jackson is involved, so Serkis can't be far behind. It is a somewhat similar relationship as Tim Burton and Johnny Depp or Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. If you see Jackson's name as producer or director I look for Serkis in the billing block. I know that there has been a ground swell about what a great actor Serkis is ever since he was Gollum in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, but what we're really left with is him as a voice actor. While motion capture can follow movements, it's hard to know where the actor ends and the CGI takes over. This is not to take away from Serkis's talent, but it would be nice to see him act as an actor rather than a fancy prop. After having seen Tintin at a holiday screening at Paramount, I can honestly say that I would not put down good money to see it. But I'm sure I am in the minority of holiday filmgoers. The Adventures of Tintin will be a big success. After all, they've already set up the sequel. Literally."

","Better than the comics. <br/><br/>First of all: This is not a Steven Spielberg movie! You can easily recognize it by the style of the movie. It is a Peter Jackson movie, therefore I was disappointed not to see his name loud and clear on the screen, but I recognized his company ""Wingnut"". :-)<br/><br/>Sure, Spielberg has its merits. - Lately: Real Steel And also his failures (my opinion): - Cowboys & Aliens - Transformers (all of them) Or moments where he is 50/50: - Super 8 But his strength lies in the past: - Back to the Future - The Goonies - Gremlins - Poltergeist Those are simply unforgettable and got him his fame.<br/><br/>Now when it comes to Mr. Peter Jackson it is a whole different thing. This man has practically only successes. My favorites are: - District 9 - The Lovely Bones (also with Steve, but also this one is more likely a Peter movie) - King Kong - The Frighteners - Braindead (the second best) - Bad Taste (the best of them all)<br/><br/>Why all this listings. Now when you look close and you know all those movies you can judge by the style that Tintin is a Peter Jackson movie.<br/><br/>To the movie itself: I never really liked the comics as kid. They were somehow chaotic and weird. The movie manages to bring a little bit order into Herge's original story telling style, but still too much of it remains. Still it gives you an entertaining time, but let's hope that not all of the comic series will make it to the screen, that would simply be too much."
"choudari1506","4","3","11","13 November 2011"," Not a Spielberg Movie
","I couldn't believe myself, that this a movie directed by Steven Spielberg. Got a chance to watch this movie in 3D and had to shell out a good amount of money for this. I am compelled to write this review as i was completely disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie starts on an interesting note with TinTin in a market place buying a souvenir of Unicorn and a host of characters warning about the consequences of having the Unicorn and asking him to return it. However, as soon as the other characters get introduced, the first half completely wanes out and becomes completely predictable. By the end of the first half, i felt like walking out.Instead, stayed back to watch the second half as i had to justify the money spent on the ticket.<br/><br/>In the second half, though the movie seems to be picking up some pace, again the movie becomes a drag and predictable making your visit to the theater a customary one.<br/><br/>The characters of Thompson brothers is just there for the sake of it. Captain Haddock seen in his drunken antiques doesn't arise any interest apart from a few scenes. The scenes of TinTin and the Captain fail to create any magic and look too Obvious and dumb. The character of Sakharine was the only character which was interesting. <br/><br/>If you had watched the classic TinTin series, which you would have certainly if you are reading this review, then please stay away from this. The screen adaptation is a complete drag. Neither the Story nor the screenplay could do no justice to the classic animation character. It is better, to watch the classic animation series of TinTin then this forgettable master-piece from Spielberg.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie doesn't deserve any stars. I had to give Four, only for the effort which was put to bring the animation to life which was so clear and vivid.<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A SPIELBERG MOVIE!!!!!!!"

","There have not been many huge animation surprises this year, and after just watching the movie, my conclusion is that ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is not a huge surprise too. Don't get me wrong. The movie is still good, very good in fact. It is just that I expected as it is the mastermind Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>The movie starts off by giving us some background information of the story and the adventure begins very soon, and it gets pretty exciting scene after scene. This movie shows the main character, Tintin's determination and curiosity that drive him to tirelessly pursue the truth.<br/><br/>The animation is great; the voice acting is great. Though I haven't seen for myself the difference between 2D and 3D, but still, judging on the intensity of the scenes, the 3D should be a better, and undoubtedly worthwhile choice.<br/><br/>As Steven Spielberg first try on animation, this is not disappointing. For me, this is the best animated film of the year, but as I've mentioned above, 2011 hasn't been a very active year for animated films. My guess is that ""Tintin"" will most definitely get nominated for Best Animated in the Oscars, and quite possibly will win. After all, Spielberg is a big name and this movie isn't really bad, and it is released in the right time, too."
"kevin1111-1","2","2","6","17 June 2013"," So painfully dull my family could not bear to finish it
","The good: The cgi is outstanding, the most realistic I have ever seen. John Williams' score is wonderful, as always. The casting works well, the acting is acceptable. <br/><br/>The bad: Everything else. I hate to criticize the story, as it is beloved and a classic, but it needed much fleshing out and expanding to work as a movie. Instead it seems as thin as the newspaper it originally appeared upon. There are no subplots, no character development, nothing to draw us into the story, nothing make us care about the characters and what happens to them. Some predictable things happen, and we are left uncaring and bored.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is a disaster -- a terrible waste of time, money and talent. Many other reviews say it was a good story ruined by the Hollywood treatment. Instead it seemed to me the exact opposite, a thin story which worked as a comic but needed to change a lot more in order to work as a film. Other similar projects have worked in the past because they were properly rewritten for the screen. This one, instead, was just Tintin the comic, remade in cgi, and that didn't work at all."
"babakm","3","2","6","28 December 2011"," Much Ado About Nothing
","I very much disliked this movie, not just because it was not a TinTin Adventure but for the fact that it had intentionally aimed for the box office.<br/><br/>Although it may not be sinful to just look at a movie as invest and return game, but when someone plays this game with one of the most delicate artistic aces of the contemporary comics then it shall be considered invidious.<br/><br/>What I understood from this movie was, Spielberg probably was reading a few pages from some of the Herge's creation, one night, when unfortunately he also watched Quantum of Solace and Transformers in a row. The result is not a re-creation of TinTin but just a clueless, meaningless action movie.<br/><br/>As oppose to most TinTin books where every frame and dialogue is there for a purpose, here in this melange you can swap dialogues between characters or even watch the movie from the end to the beginning and nothing would matter as there is no plan except rumble, shootings, hit and run and a few cliché words between players.<br/><br/>The most colourful character of TinTin adventures, Captain Haddock, is pictured so dumb that someone with no background could not imagine why he has been so loved for many years. Even TinTin lacks the good judgement purely because special effects, 3D and a good animation can replace his intelligence.<br/><br/>Irony is, many Hollywood movies depict the terror when machines try to overcome human. May be that's what is happening now, so even a smart director like Spilberg relies more on computer than his talent."
"devcybiko","4","2","6","25 December 2011"," An amazingly animated Sunday-morning cartoon serial.
","WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW: THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN<br/><br/>MINI-REVIEW : An amazingly animated Sunday-morning cartoon serial.<br/><br/>RATING : See it in theaters If you're under 12, otherwise wait for the instant download (Rating System: ""See it in theaters,"" ""Wait for the instant download,"" ""Don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>Tintin is a youthful reporter with lots of street cred. He purchases a replica of ""The Unicorn"" - a 17th century schooner (with three masts, double decks, and 50 guns). No sooner does he get it home when bad things begin happening. Someone steals the ship from his flat. Then they come back and ransack his rooms. Then a man comes to his door to warn him of impending danger, and the man is gunned down by machine gun fire. But before the man expires, he spells out a clue on a nearby newspaper in his own blood. Tintin deciphers the clue as a remote city in the Middle East. But before he can follow up on the clue, he is abducted and taken prisoner on a cargo ship. And we're off<br/><br/>""The Adventures of Tintin"" is the big-screen version of a series of comic books published from 1907-1983. Stephen Spielberg helms this recreation and his talents are evident on the screen. In many ways, the movie resembles an Indiana Jones adventure: it is set in the same time frame (the 1940s) and there are a number of thrilling chase and fight scenes.<br/><br/>The feature is animated with the same technology that brought us ""Polar Express."" However, a lot of the technical problems have been solved. The eyes in ""Polar Express"" were creepy as they didn't seem to track correctly and gave a sort of vacant zombie-like presentation. This problem has been solved exceedingly well in ""Tintin."" Not only does Tintin's eyes move in the direction you expect them to, you can see Tintin focus on a bit of writing and watch his eyes move subtly from left to write as he reads.<br/><br/>Also, the hair and skin in this feature is so realistic that at times you think you're looking at real people. This is especially true of Tintin's trademark shock of ginger hair. Tintin's dog Snowy stares down a Rottweiler whose features are so detailed that you might believe it was an actual dog and not computer graphic imagery. The humans were so realistic that only their cartoonish noses gave away the fact that they were rendered.<br/><br/>While we're on the subject of CGI, the physics in this movie is uncanny. Feathers float, people and objects in the water bob. In almost every situation in this film you would believe you were looking at real-life objects in real-world physical reactions. Almost – there is one chase scene that taxed the limits of the CGI physics and some things look unnatural. But you'll be willing to overlook it since it's an animation.<br/><br/>So let's talk about the problems with this film. Firstly, if you've never read the comic books ""Tintin"" is based upon you may be a bit lost. Tintin is introduced to us without any description of his age. He looks like he's about 12 but as a reporter has many credits (exposed through a pan-shot of his wall-adorned news clippings). He talks like a youngster, but fights like a prize fighter. In the early scenes, Tintin appears to be somewhat inept. His dog Snowy repeatedly finds the clues or saves his bacon. I began to think that this would be carried through the entire film. But no, Snowy becomes almost irrelevant, even an annoyance at certain points. So, Tintin's character is not well defined.<br/><br/>Another problem with this film is the ""serial"" feel to it. I felt as though we were looking at about 10 episodes of a series of cliffhangers. I have no doubt that Stephen Spielberg knows more about storytelling than I do, yet the concept of a clear goal for Tintin doesn't materialize until about halfway through the movie – and that caused me to feel bored at about the thirty-minute mark. Writer Steven Moffat (well-known for his work on the reboot of ""Dr. Who"") seems to have been ham-strung by keeping true to the original comics.<br/><br/>Finally, the target age of the audience was unclear to me. I didn't do any research on ""Tintin"" before going to the film so I was expecting something that would appeal to all ages. The level of sophistication of the plot and dialog was reminiscent of the old ""Hardy Boys"" mysteries. I asked a young man of about 12 years what he thought of the film and he was enthusiastic about it and wanted to see more. He especially like the swashbuckling sword fights. However, while my date enjoyed the film, we agreed that is seemed to lack a certain maturity that would appeal to adults. In an age where Disney and Pixar films are constructed to appeal to both adults and children, it is a definite negative that it was designed to appeal to only children. The film was produced in association with Nickelodeon which leads me to wonder if a ""Tintin"" animated series is in our future.<br/><br/>So, if you're a young person who likes adventure, or an adult who loves the original comic book, you need to see this in theaters in 3D. But if you're not, you might want to catch this in the summer on instant download to enjoy the animation. And if you are not that much into the leading, bleeding edge of computer animation, don't waste your time."

","I love it! The animation was top notch, it stuck more or less to the plot, and it wasn't wrecked with childish humor. It brought back the true feel of a Tintin novel, down to the looks and attitude of all all the characters. That's how I imagined each and every one of them. I thought for sure that they would mess up on at least Snowy, but they didn't. Must see adventure movie. Very innovative chase scenes, high quality humor, excellent voice acting, flawless 3d, deep characters, evil bad guys, clanging sword fights, everything that will make a perfect pirate/detective movie. It's not even that hard to understand to someone who hasn't read the books. If you haven't seen it, see it."

","I entered the cinema hall and the credits started and immediately there was an action sequence in the first five minutes. There is no building of characters or story. At the beginning itself it seems that half the story is over and we are seeing the second part. <br/><br/>No story building. The director has no qualms. He plunges straight to the action scenes without telling any story. Coming to the characters, Tintin isn't that striking. The range of face expressions are very limited and get boring from the start of the film. Also they have mixed two to three stories of the comics and even then they can't get the story right. Captain Haddock, such a humorous and inimitable character has been turned into irritable and childish puppet. It's so sad that they messed up. Why are they so hell bent on including so many action scenes one after another. Anyone who read the comics and loves them is in store of a great disappointment. <br/><br/>They have missed the dumbness of Thomson and Thompson, the wittiness of captain haddock and the cleverness of Tintin. All they have done is churn out another movie which follows the Hollywood formula. Sad as it is that they have turned a lovable story into one of their escapist movies."

"DICK STEEL","Null","2","6","6 November 2011"," A Nutshell Review: The Adventures of Tintin
","Regular trips to the bookstore when I was 10 had introduced me to the world Herge created with his jetsetting baby faced reporter Tintin and his faithful canine companion Snowy, and I was hooked enough to slowly but surely, get all the stories ever created, sharing them through the book club with my primary school class on the joys of these adventures. And I probably can gauge how well received those stories were, being read and re-read again countless of times by many, that they were expectedly returned in less than pristine condition. I still have those books and from time to time turn to them for timeless adventures that only Herge knows how to craft, building a world of likable characters and a universe in which they operate in.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson now translate this for the big screen. There have been other adaptations, animated ones that I've seen before as a kid that took place on Black Island and on the moon even, so to go down that animated route wouldn't be to introduce the stories to a whole new 3D generation. Making it live action would mean to discover a new cast who would demand a lot for the number of potential sequels that can be made in their likeness. So the best alternative is to marry both worlds and have it animated, but voiced and moving as if they would in the real world through motion capture, and what had been delivered is nothing less than a flawless piece of moving art that had leapt out of the pages of a book, and onto the silver screen. A 3D IMAX one at that, and I seriously urge everyone who has the intent to watch this to do so in this format that does justice to the tremendous amount of work and effort to finally kickstart what could be a lucrative franchise.<br/><br/>Those who are purists may want to steer clear of this, but I suppose having it adapted by Steven Mofatt, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish meant an amalgamation of known Tintin adventures, but given that modern day sensibilities in terms of narrative development and action sequences shot, yet having Spielberg's astuteness in keeping things true to the spirit of the books. With recognizable highlights from The Crab with the Golden Claws, Red Rackham's Treasure and of course The Secret of the Unicorn, the scribes have fused together a very fluid action adventure that moves at breakneck speed, never wasting any frame with Spielberg showing he still has what it takes for something family friendly while upping the ante through his works, redeeming himself from his last attempt being the terrible Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull that he had unceremoniously diverted blame of its prime weakness to George Lucas. Here, he got that smooth flowing narrative, allowing him to focus on how best to bring across the screen adaptation for a family friendly audience.<br/><br/>And Tintin fans will be delighted with Jamie Bell's voicing of Tintin, and Andy Serkis playing the role of Captain Thunering Typhoons Haddock, being essentially what's envisaged of that role of the drunken sailor. Bit characters like Thomson and Thompson (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg, excellent naturally choices I must add) the bumbling Interpol cops, Nestor the butler (Enn Reitel) and the Milanese Nightingale Bianca Castafiore (Kim Stengel) all make appearances even though some did not feature in the original tale, such as Senorita Castafiore who possesses a quality that worked so well in the diabolical scheme concocted here, with Daniel Craig taking on the role of the scheming Ivanovich Sakharine. Only Professsor Calculus is left, who is primed for the next film if it flows logically as a follow up film, and thank heavens nobody in the right mind decided to follow recent trends in making animals talk, so Snowy behaves very much like a dog, and in my opinion almost always steals everyone's thunder through its antics, providing just cause to peel your eyes away from the main proceedings, and following him anywhere that he roams on screen.<br/><br/>From the opening credits to little nuggets of easter eggs scattered for fans to spot, such as the first look at Tintin's home where we see articles from other well known adventures such as The Broken Ear and King Ottokar's Sceptre, one suspects the larger adventures from the books such as Destination Moon may be primed for future film installments should this one prove successful. Peter Jackson takes over the sequel and I'm waiting with bated breaths for that one, before the third movie in which both Spielberg and Jackson will share directing responsibilities, and if they are anything like this one, I'm signing up already. And do head to your local bookstores as well if your interest is keen to pick up those books again, because a whole new generation will be introduced to the film, and one can bet that their interests will be piqued right after this wonderful film treatment. It's always a joy with adaptations done right, and this is clearly something highly recommended!"

","The Adventures Of Tintin is a great movie with a very well developed plot and a fantastic voice cast. It is an extremely engaging story that kept me at the edge of my seat from start to finish, with a fun, layered adventure that we have not seen in movies in a long time. The concentration on the three main characters is very strong, that being Tintin, Captain Haddock and Tintin's dog Snowy, we get a great sense of their relationship, with a connection formed that is powerful, making the film even more interesting. <br/><br/>I feel like the movie let itself down a little by being so short. Only running at roughly 100 minutes, it ended a little abruptly, feeling as if Spielberg and Jackson had a specific run time given and were struggling to keep with it, so they had to rush the overall conclusion to the story. It felt a little underwhelming as a result of this, it did not have the most satisfying finale. <br/><br/>The voice cast is phenomenal, delivering intense, dedicated performances. The likes of Jamie Bell, Daniel Craig, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are all given a chance to shine in their respective roles. However, the highlight for me had to be Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock, a very layered performance unlike any other he has done before, he is certainly the most intriguing character. <br/><br/>It has an Indiana Jones vibe to it throughout that made me smile. Action packed and beautifully animated, The Adventures of Tintin is a delight for anyone looking for a good family or adventure film. <br/><br/>Tintin joins forces with a sailor to stop a treasure map from getting in to the wrong hands."

","Well, I'm not going to tell a lot from the movie itself since I don't want to spoil other people's fun who come to see the movie. However I can say that Spielberg and Jackson did a mighty good job on bringing Belgiums favourite character Tintin to life.<br/><br/>Visually the movie was just stunning, Tintin, Snowy, Haddock and the other characters and their surroundings we're just so lifelike, it took me several minutes to become aware of the fact that this is a animationfilm just like Beowulf. With the main difference... Tintin's clearly on the highest sport of the ladder. I don't think it's technically possible to make a character so realistic as Spielberg did. If this technique is expanded, Hollywood shiver and quake, cause real actors won't be necessary anymore. Throughout the entire movie you will keep asking yourself the question whether these characters and environments are real or fake. Personally, this film lands just below Avatar in case of visuals and effects.<br/><br/>Now, I do have a remark and I don't want to spoil the Tintin-fans their fun, but after seeing this movie I genually believe that you shouldn't do 3 comics in a movie which lasts for almost 2 hours. There are lot of elements of the original story in it, but I just couldn't help myself saying in mind that this isn't right. This isn't how the original story goes... However, if you're not a Tintin-fan, or you don't have read any of these stories you will find this movie quite entertaining and it will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout some very exciting scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, a really good movie that is definitely a must see for every movie-fan and I do smell an Oscar in this movie somewehere... Don't know exactly which one, but there is. If you doubt on deciding which movie to see... choose this one, you get a lot for your money in return.<br/><br/>(ps: excuse me for some grammatical mistakes in this review)"

","Animation is taking interesting courses these days. Technology is being conquered by creative thinking, and that is giving us new ways to see. I suppose it's always been like that throughout history.<br/><br/>There are several nice things about this film, I was really pleased with it, in what it does well. First, we have Spielberg back. The good one. There is one S. with an uncontrollable will to entertain, and be clever about it. That's great, the guy who gave us Indiana Jones, ET, Minority Report, etc. Than, there's the S. who wants to put his name in the book of serious filmmakers. The guy from Schindler's list, and the disastrous AI. I don't like that director. And than you have the million dollar making producer, who sometimes directs what he was only supposed to produce. That's a business, i'm OK with that one. This film is great in how it revives the 1st Spielberg, the one i've grown up loving. He's here, with no prejudice or failure, brilliant in his visual conception of the grand arch of action. Now, he's together with Peter Jackson, who's been building a world of interesting toys for the creation of cinematic visual worlds, something he began doing in LOTR. These 2 guys do fine here.<br/><br/>Than we have Tintin. I'm totally into the books, I know everyone by heart. I don't have the personality to become a geek about anything, but I do know a lot about the books, its contexts, the author, etc. I understand there will be a number of hardcore fans who will dismiss any changes made to the original stories, as well as the blended elements from several albums. I'm fine with that, because mostly I think the changes were made to favour the visual ideas that were to be fulfilled in the minds of the makers. From the first half-hour or so on, this film is conceived as a succession of grand action sequences. These required different sets. So they include the Karaboudjan bits to take us first to the sea, than to the desert, and finally to the Moroccan city. There we have the less believable sequence of the film in terms of actual physical depictions, but also the one where the possibilities of the virtual eye are more pushed forward as far as this film goes: we have an extended chase sequence, using several transportation mediums, crossing several sets. The character being chased is a hawk, who obviously is free in terms of motion. Vertical space, multiple points of view (he is not grounded), that's the stuff that makes this sequence, where the camera and edition choose to change stance and pov multiple times, and where the spatial conception of the place reveals to us. I personally would have like to have had more of the hawk's point of view, but i was pleased. That and the other action sequences are why the film is built as it is.<br/><br/>The first half hour of the film actually looks from another film universe. It's a tense, noir sequence, of clues and allusions, shadows and mystery. That's actually much more what Tintin is about, in terms of its dramatic core. He is a character of adventures, but hardly an action figure. I'll keep this first half hour as what the film should have been about, if there wasn't a world of visual opportunities to be got from the animation according to WETA.<br/><br/>The need for the 3D, apart from the possible (but arguable) commercial appeal of it, eludes me here. I'd like to review this on a 2D version, just to make sure the 3D brings nothing new to it. And that's a pity.<br/><br/>Of course there is also a possible line of argument, on whether the visual flat representation of Tintin's drawings in the comics would be fairly transposed to the screen. I actually think it is, as the dynamics of the drawings are aptly maintained even if using a different visual personality. The old Tintin cartoons that tried the transition to television are far less successful, although they try hard to be like the books.<br/><br/>The initial credits are an incredible bit on their own, Pink Panther like.<br/><br/>My opinion: 4/5 good news, we have a new director called Spielberg back."

","The Adventures of Tintin (2011): Dir: Steven Spielberg / Voices: Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Toby Jones, Tony Curran: Impressive visual treat based on the classic character. Tintin is a young journalist in Europe who, along with his trusty dog Snowy, become involved in a plot that surfaced when a model ship that he purchased is stolen. Apparently there is a scroll object inside that is one third of a puzzle in need of solving. After being abducted and thrown aboard a ship, he meets the drunken captain Haddock who is also a prisoner. Steven Spielberg seems to be reflecting upon his success with Raider of the Lost Ark, where similar adventures took place. Jamie Bell voices Tintin who is intelligent and optimistic. Andy Serkis voices Haddock who is the only one who can solve the plot at hand. His drunken mishaps result in much amusement but his back story involving a lost treasure and the loss of a ship render him one to root for. Daniel Craig voices the villain Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine who is after the three model ships, and shares a past with Haddock. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost bring much comic relief as inspectors Thompson and Thompson who are trailing a pickpocket voiced by Toby Jones. Tony Curran voices a Lieutenant who is an ally to Tintin. The film is wondrous to look at with its lavish detail and shadows and lighting. It is pure entertainment at its very best and it presents Spielberg's boyish nature for adventure while his War Horse is released at a similar date showcasing his serious nature. Either way he often wins than not. Score: 9 / 10"
"squirrel_burst","9","1","2","11 January 2015"," Exhilarating adaptation of the books that excites the eyes
","""The Adventures of Tintin"" is non-stop action and thrills. It's groundbreaking in the way that the 3D motion capture is used to perfectly adapt the stylized illustrations of Hergé and also manages to avoid that uncanny valley look that has plagued so many films made in this style. Fans of the original comic books will be happy to see a faithful adaptation of the books, and fans of Spielberg's Indiana Jones' series will be more than impressed with the action sequences. Some of the humor falls flat and the movie runs slightly too long, but the visual style and chase sequences make it a terrific adventure film. If you want an example of what animation can do that would never work with live actors, look no further than the elaborate chase sequence towards the second third of the movie, which is done in one continuous shot and is truly amazing. The film is worth seeing for that sequence alone. (3D Theatrical version on the big screen, August 2011)"

","I Really Really Enjoyed this Movie. I was put off for a Long Time Watching this because I thought the Animation was a bit too lifelike in the trailers, but I was so wrong. The Animation is some of the Best I've ever seen. <br/><br/>I've read some of Tin Tin's Adventures years ago & was a Fan but not enough to make me Rush to the Cinema to see this. That's why I think I got such a Pleasant Surprise on my Viewing. <br/><br/>The Storyline to the Movie from what I've read is an Amalgamation of 3 Classic Tin Tin stories. It's a Full on Exciting & Thrilling Ride from Start to Finish. With Clever Jokes & One Liners to keep even the Hardcore Fans pleased. <br/><br/>The First & Second Act Breezed by in a Glance, with Puzzles & Quick Thinking on Tin Tin's part making it a Joy to watch, But I did find the Third Act Dragged Out a Little & I put it down to Captain Haddock being so Incompetent it became Annoying. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong the Action was Top Notch & it Brought me back to Watching Indiana Jones as a child which is clearly what Spielberg was aiming to achieve here. The Whole Team behind this Movie should return for the Sequel which I hear is being Planned for 2015. <br/><br/>Nitpicking aside I would totally recommend Tin Tin to anybody who Loves Action & Adventure with a Good Splash of Comedy thrown in to Keep you Smiling.<br/><br/>A Special Nod to Snowy being One of the Main Stars of the Show.<br/><br/>Great Snakes!!!"

","I've got to say, I did not expect to like it as much as I did. I don't know how faithful it is to the original comic, but it was a really fun and insanely creative adventure film. All the characters were memorable and likable in some way and the CG animation was stunningly detailed while keeping the cartoonish quality on the animation. All the actors are good (I actually thought that the lead actor was Elijah Wood, but it turns out that it's the guy who played Billy Elliot), but special attention should go to Andy Serkis (who you may know as Gollum) on his performance of the drunken ship captain. It shows that he's got a great comedic delivery and can hold his own as a secondary lead. Hopefully he gets more diverse work because of this rather than just voicing monsters. Steven Moffat and Edgar Wright penned the script with one other person and they give the film a very offbeat quality that I think puts this above a lot of animated adventure films. All in all, a really good experience that I wish I'd caught in theaters. Also, gotta give special props to Simon Pegg and Nick Frost who play two very amusing dry comic relief characters. I always love when those two are in a movie together and this is no exception. Go see it."

"JPfanatic93","7","1","2","21 September 2013"," Tintin's off to a good start
","Steven Spielberg's first foray into the realm of motion capture, for which he used the classic comic adventures of Hergé's Tintin as the source material, combining elements from such beloved tales as The Crab with the Golden Claws, Red Rackham's Treasure and of course, The Secret of the Unicorn itself. Using real human performances from accomplished actors, the otherwise fully animated characters seem that much more convincing, making it a fine blend between animation and live-action, about as close to the original comics as an animated movie could hope to get. The young reporter Tintin (charming Jamie Bell) stumbles upon a model ship, the Unicorn, at a flea market, and soon gets caught up in a plot to find the location of the actual ship that sunk hundreds of years ago, loaded with treasure. The sinister Sakharine (Daniel Craig) is after his model and several others like it, to solve the puzzle of their predecessor's whereabouts on the bottom of the ocean. Tintin and his loyal dog Snowy team up with the ever drunk Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis, the undisputed king of mo-cap), a descendant of the Unicorn's commander, to keep Sakharine from achieving his goal and find the treasure first, for which they'll have to brave storms at sea, plain crashes, scorching desert crossings and the excessively high pitched voice of the Milanese Nightingale, Bianca Castafiore. Meanwhile, back at home, bumbling inspectors Thomson and Thompson (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg) – no relation! – are out to catch a shrewd pickpocket. Tintin may be the hero of the piece, but it's Haddock, Snowy and the two policemen who deliver the best lines, funniest gags and most memorable characters overall, just as in the comics: compared to them, Tintin himself remains fairly dull overall. Anyone who has ever seen an Indiana Jones movie and kept thinking of Tintin will be pleased to know Spielberg has perfectly carried over the tone of his Indy films to this first Adventure of Tintin, which is also quite suitable for a younger audience (and should adequately warn kids against the dangers of rampant alcohol consumption). Producer Peter Jackson is supposed to direct the next installment, but working on The Hobbit trilogy has thus far kept him from doing so. Hopefully he will pick it up soon, since it would be a darn shame if there ended up being just a single Adventure of Tintin."
"SnoopyStyle","7","1","2","14 September 2013"," Good solid CG work
","If you're familiar with the great TinTin comic adventure books, then this grand sweeping adventure story is exactly what you'd expect from this franchise. Steven Spielberg uses a real CG motion capture technique. It looks pretty good. The facial expressions are head and shoulders better than Polar Express 7 years before. The eyes are getting better. The haunted blank face is no longer there. However it's still odd to try to pass a cartoon for real people.<br/><br/>There is too much POV camera movements in long sweeping scenes. It's tiring for the eyes. And we've seen it before. There's no need to dwell on it. It's as if Spielberg wants to show off. It adds nothing to the storytelling. As for the story, I did find Captain Haddock annoying when drunk. I think it's supposed to be funny, but it's not funny. I really didn't find any jokes funny."

","I've never read the original Tintin comics, but even I can recognize that charming cartoon character with the big round head, the small tuft of blonde hair, and the cute white dog at his side. It has been decades since the character's genesis, but even today, he proves to be just as endearing as ever, thanks to this 2011 computer-animated film.<br/><br/>The Adventures of Tintin offers a heck of an adventure, with loads of eye candy for audiences of all ages. Most of the film is comprised of action setpieces that are really inventive and involved; it's almost like a vaudeville act, with characters tumbling, falling, flying, and colliding with each other, resulting in even more crazy damage, more problematic situations, and sometimes inducing some decent laughter. One of the film's most awe-inspiring scenes is a continuous shot, lasting for what must be a full five minutes or so, with the camera tracking Tintin and the Captain riding through a town, chasing animals, with buildings getting wrecked all around them. The timing and choreography of each scene is so precise, it's brilliantly entertaining. The film suffers very little drag in between, and there's always enough elements of danger and peril to keep the stakes high. At the same time, it's never too high or scary for younger audiences. If there's anything to complain about, it's just that it's almost too much. Many scenes strain believability, and can become very absurd.<br/><br/>In spite of the relentless action, however, the film's story is left with limited room to breathe. It jumps right into the mystery and adventure, without any introduction to the characters or the world they inhabit. It isn't hard to catch onto things as the film goes along, but there's no real background to Tintin, and it makes him flat and rather less interesting. It's the mystery element that drives this plot, but even then, the mystery is quite predictable and thinly developed. Really, the movie is built on the action, with one scene leading to another; it's serviceable and fun, but nothing terribly deep or compelling.<br/><br/>This film has top-notch animation quality. The amount of detail, precision, and movement is phenomenal; there are moments that look so real, it's amazing. This film has decent voice-acting; it can be a bit tiresome to listen to Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock, but Jamie Bell, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, and everybody else provides quality performances. Writing is not bad, and it generally gets the job done, but some more depth would have been welcome. This production uses some very awesome-looking settings, locations, props, costumes, and character designs. John Williams' music score is not bad.<br/><br/>This film definitely entertains with its imaginative adventure sequences, and it comes close to replicating the same kind of energy and tone as a typical Indiana Jones picture. It is a film that audiences of all ages can enjoy, even if the story is a bit lacking. Recommended.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Average | Film: Perfect)"
"redx1708","4","1","2","2 February 2013"," Could have been great.
","OK, let's start with the positives: The technical side is rather awesome and it's definitely fast pace action all the way. Also i kinda liked Bianca Castafiores' aria. And that's about it. This is Spielberg and Jackson and not Herge. Jackson managed to do Lord of the Rings without doing too much damage to the original script, but that seems to be completely impossible for Spielberg. What happened to the charm? What happened to the humor? Where is Tournesol, and why for 1000 blundering bazookas (i'm sure the Captain would have said), was it necessary to change a great adventure into a disaster like this. The story works well enough in the beginning where it pretty much follows the original, but then all of a sudden it seems like Spielberg feels compelled to outdo Herge. WHY???? There was nothing wrong with the original. As a matter of fact it worked a whole lot better than this. Shame on you, Steven!!!"
"adrongardner","8","1","2","7 January 2013"," Surprisingly good
","The Adventures of Tintin is an excellent apology for Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. Spielberg lives up all his serialized, globe trotting, treasure hunting, pirate chasing fantasies he flooded into The Goonies and The Last Crusade. As the property sat on the shelf for so many years, it's pretty easy to see very strong parallels particularly in Last Crusade, but this is a superior work.<br/><br/>Animation has come a long ways from Polar Express, but the characters still look as if their heads are too big. It's still not quite right but not too distracting.<br/><br/>I'm keeping this one short because you're better off not taking my word for this and just seeing it yourself. The last third lacks the intrigue and adventure of the earlier parts of the story. Either from budget reasons or deadlines, Tintin seems to settle into too many clichés toward the end to put a quick finish on the story rather than actually flesh out something more in line with the careful characterizations of what came before. <br/><br/>Minus one point for the big headed Daniel Craig character and minus two points for the flat and cliché finish.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Bring on the next one!"

There are plenty of genuinely funny moments throughout the film to go with the numerous action sequences. It is also surprisingly violent for a PG rated film. The plot is pretty far fetched but to be honest when a film looks this good it doesn't really matter. <br/><br/>I watched this with my two young sons and they enjoyed it even more than me.

"DubhDoo","8","1","2","2 January 2013"," Spielberg delivers a rollicking adventure that never loses sight of its source material
","Prior to watching Steven Spielberg's 'Tintin' adaptation, I decided to read the three Hergé stories upon which it is based, 'The Crab with the Golden Claws', 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'. I instantly fell in love them, finding them to be simple and innocent yet rollicking and charming adventures nonetheless. Despite the mixed response to their big screen counterpart, I felt at ease going in; why? Well, a film directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson, scored by John Williams and written by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish couldn't be bad could it? Thankfully, the answer was positive, with the film turning out to be far more enjoyable than expected.<br/><br/>'The Adventures of Tintin' follows the eponymous character (Jamie Bell) and his dog and loyal companion Snowy as they stumble across a model of a sailing ship called the 'Unicorn', this attracts the attention of the villainous Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig) who desperately desires the secrets it holds, which results in a globe-trotting adventure as Tintin encounters the not-exactly-sober Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) whilst attempting to foil Sakharine's plan to stop them as they try to uncover the mystery the 'Unicorn' has to offer...<br/><br/>It's been quite a while since Spielberg last delivered a rollicking romp – War of the Worlds was let down Dakota Fanning's never ending screams and a too convenient ending, Munich was rather good but not exactly classic Spielberg and as for 'Crystal Skull', well, let's not go there. So it was time for the Maestro of the Blockbuster to make another adventure that could sit nicely alongside 'ET', 'Jurassic Park', 'Jaws', etc, and with 'Tintin' he has done exactly that. Of all the Spielberg films, 'the Adventures of Tintin's' closest cousin is (unsurprisingly) 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. In fact, no more than two years after Indy's debut on the silver screen did Hergé give the director his blessing as the only man capable of successfully translating his creation to the big screen. <br/><br/>Spielberg is a man who knows how to handle the beloved Belgian reporter and it is clear that both he and his key companion, producer Peter Jackson adore the source material. Whether it's Hergé's 'cameo' at the beginning of the film, the blink-and-you'll-miss-it inclusion of 'Le Vingtième Siècle' (the first paper Tintin appeared in) or the similarly fan-pleasing appearance of Bianca Castafiore, it is undeniable that the dynamic duo possess deep reverence for the original comics. <br/><br/>However, Spielberg and Jackson understand that Hergé's creation and most of the world outside Central Europe have not enjoyed a lengthy waltz, so this is more than just a film for Tintinologists, presenting newcomers with a fast-paced and deeply enjoyable adventure tale. It has moments of humour that children and adults can enjoy simultaneously and great set- pieces, most notably the breathtaking Baghar-set chase sequence, which is, in my opinion, one of the finest actions sequences Spielberg has ever produced. <br/><br/>After Robert Zemeckis' 'The Polar Express' retreated into 'uncanny valley' with a one-way ticket, some doubted the potential of fully mo- capped feature films. Spielberg has learnt from Zemeckis' unfortunate mistakes, utilizing the technology by portraying things quite unfilmmable (an army tank unwillingly carrying a hotel through a busy market anyone?) and performing wonderful camera moves, best seen where Haddock tells the intrepid reporter of his ancestor, Sir Francis and the sea battle he was part of, with the lens seamlessly flowing between his telling of the story and the battle itself, helping to build momentum retain the brisk pace and immerse the viewer in the heart of the action.<br/><br/>The film has its flaws though; Daniel Craig's villain is somewhat drippy and bland, the final set piece is a bit anticlimactic and some of the Thomson's gags fall flat, but in the end, these minor problems do little to affect the movie as a whole. Jamie Bell remains the ""blank canvas"" of the comics and is likable all the same, however it is Andy Serkis who stands out in the cast; no surprises there. He is perfectly suited to the role of Haddock, giving the character a Scottish accent, but the film its heart. Overall, this is an enjoyable romp for viewers young and old, both familiar and not with the source material. It's action-packed, visually beautiful, light in tone and great entertainment. When choosing a suitable filmmaker, Hergé couldn't have been more right."

"eatfirst","6","1","2","14 September 2012"," Beautiful to look at, charming to watch, easy to forget
","As his first full animation, Tintin may appear to be something of a new departure for Spielberg, but in every other respect, what we have here is a familiar and vintage caper that demonstrates just how easily the Bergster can knock this stuff off in his sleep these days.<br/><br/>The unavoidable comparison that springs immediately to mind is with his Indiana Jones movies: The period setting (not exactly specified, but easily 30s / 40s in feel) bathed in a nostalgic glow, a globetrotting adventure in search of some lost treasure, voyages by tramp steamer or bi-plane, even a chase through some north-African market streets. Just a quiff instead of a fedora, and the formula is all in place. Now it's fair enough to point out that Raiders and its sequels were hugely inspired by an older generation of serial comic book adventures from the 40s and 50s in which Tintin rightly holds an esteemed place, but seen from a modern filmic perspective, there is a strong sense that we've seen this done before, and in at least some respects, better.<br/><br/>First, the good stuff. Tintin is beautifully animated, in a manner which is rich and detailed, but also retains a touch of period comic-book style which never draws attention but feels just right for this world. There are many stunningly visualised edits between locations, or shifts in time from story to storyteller, that match the very best that Spielberg has ever delivered in his live action movies. There are also several bravura action sequences, all of which are executed with wit and perfect pacing and never feel forced or out of place, and usually come with some charming touches of humour. While some of the broader slapstick moments fall somewhat flat (no pun etc.), just keep watching that dog, often in the corner of the frame away from the main action for some of the most gentle moments of incidental pleasure that the movie has to offer.<br/><br/>However, for me, there's no getting away from the most glaring problem with Tintin, and that's Tintin, the personality vacuum at the centre of the whole enterprise. Utterly devoid of any notable or involving character traits, he functions purely as a nominal protagonist around whom a plot can revolve, but never to whom our empathy may adhere. And speaking of plot, therein lies the secondary failing of Tintin (which sounds like a title for a sequel if ever I heard one). Many adventure stories may rely heavily on a MacGuffin to drive them along, but in the best examples (and again, there's no getting away from the Dr. Jones comparisons here, and all of them unfavourable to the cherub-faced reporter), this is merely a plot device to lead our hero to some greater and more profound end (reconciliation, enlightenment, the saving of a life, or the world, or a little piece of home), but in Tintin the MacGuffin is the whole plot, and so, having been kept pleasantly charmed, if not totally thrilled along the way, I arrived rather unexpectedly at the end, with things much as they were at the beginning."
"sebling-427-68246","10","1","2","19 July 2012"," Greatest comedic action film since Raiders of the Lost Ark
","A fabulous action movie. I am always wary of 3D animated films that try to depict this level of realism, but Tintin pulls it of with aplomb. The human motion, and particularly the facial expressions are absolutely spot on, the sweet spot of exaggerated realism which allows a very engaging performance by the actors ...and animators!<br/><br/>As an action film it has flawless pacing, showing that Spielberg has not lost his touch, as long as someone else writes him a good plot! And that's where Tintin comes through where so many action films fail. It's not just the plot, but how it is scripted, drawing you into love of the genuinely likable characters, otherwise, we would not CARE if they get shot by the bad-guys, or got run over by that ship. The salt so often missing from action recipes.<br/><br/>And it's funny!<br/><br/>Bravo."

But, between, it becomes a non-stop action extravaganza going from boat to desert to opera to port. It is just too much and the final fight with cranes looks like ""Transformers"". It's above all the Spielberg of ""Indy 4"" who focus only speed that commands the camera, in spite of his old self taking a few shots: the duel about the fuse is a bit ""Hook""ish and maybe the best sequence. This CGI picture isn't wonderful: if the actors have indeed been shot live, it would have been better to keep the original shot.

","I guess I went into this with very little background. I know my son owned a collection of Tin Tin comics when he was younger. I know that this is really a significant character to a great many people. Hence, like ""The Lord of the Rings"" the portrayal of these figures is going to bring angry disappointment to a segment of our viewers. Personally, if we were to take away the amazing animation and substitute real people, this story would be like a hundred others I have seen. It is the Saturday Morning serial portrayal of a reluctant hero who finds himself in incredible scrapes. What bothered me is that I never really cared. When I saw Hugo (a contemporary of this film), I was able to identify with the central figure, and though he was an animated character, I still cared about what happens to him. I'm sure people will see my criticisms as unfair because this is more Indiana Jones than a subtle story strong on character development. I just never felt connected."

Like the another movie about detective, The Adventures of Tintin also has given us clues how to solve the puzzle. overall for this movie is good. Captain Haddock also had a important role to help Tintin to solve the problems, although he also make Tintin ""busy"" because of him. this movie had a humors scene, serious scene, and action scene. <br/><br/>I think this film is worth to be watched for Tintin Lovers."
"amahlanand","4","1","2","9 May 2012"," A Complicated Take on Simplicity
","It was a pity that the unbelievably realistic animation couldn't salvage a plot so rapid that it was barely digestible. That can be difficult to tolerate at the best of times let alone during a big screen version of an old school comic renowned for its simplicity. <br/><br/>With the likes of Spielberg and Jackson at the helm, I expected something a bit more compelling. The whole production felt pretentious, shoving so much in terms of its convoluted story and advanced animation style down the throat in order to seemingly detract from the fact that the plot line was ultimately quite ordinary with a plethora of plot holes. I do feel sorry for younger viewers who wouldn't have a clue what the heck is going on for the majority of the film. Admittedly, I didn't. <br/><br/>All the same, the plus point was unquestionably the animation which was a descendant of other decadal animated film landmarks such as Toy Story and Shrek. You would have been forgiven for thinking that this was a live action movie at times such was how realistic the animation was. Certainly kudos to technology, but we do need to draw a line between animation and live action. After all, the pull of a cartoon comes from the animation itself. <br/><br/>You always try to derive good, tame fun out of these animated flicks, even if the story didn't quite stack up and the voice acting certainly did that for me. Although there were times I could scarcely understand what Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock was blabbering on about in that strong Scottish burr, that was really the charm of his performance. I would also campaign for a spin-off Thompson and Thompson film with Simon Pegg and Nick Frost doing the honours. They vastly entertained as a comic duo (not for the first time) and did so in a kid's setting on this occasion rather than the more mature set up we are used to seeing them. I bet that sort of movie, which would barely need half a decent story, would fare much better than this with all audiences. <br/><br/>I definitely wonder, is this the Tintin that Hergé envisaged, even if a 21st century iteration? In all honestly, it does not seem to be. There were so many aspects to be admired, but admired for what reason?"

"chaugnurfaugn-269-83012","5","1","2","24 April 2012"," Further Evidence That Spielberg Has Lost Interest
","I tend to have a fairly good method for judging whether or not I think a film is worthy of praise or guilty of some cinematic flaw. I base my method on whether or not I'd watch it again. Films I love, I can watch more than once, sometimes many times. In the case of The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn, I won't be watching it again.<br/><br/>Not that this is necessarily a bad film. The voice-acting is of a decent standard (the strangely under-employed Serkis predictably stealing the show); the animation is technically advanced and at points breath-taking. The story is a hybrid of two or three Tintin books and there are a variety of nods, winks and tips of the hat in the direction of hardcore fans, which I suspect hardcore fans will either love or hate.<br/><br/>But there are underlying problems here which seem to be the trademark of modern Spielberg efforts. Long gone are the days of ET and Close Encounters. The shine is gone from Spielberg's talent and while the remaining vestiges of, admittedly, higher than average ability continue to glimmer from time to time, there's a veneer of tarnished weariness about this once epic director. You can't help wondering if Spielberg has lost his love for movie-making and is, at this point in his life, merely going through the motions.<br/><br/>Less subtle are the glaring problems with this movie, beginning with what must be one of the longest and most irritating opening credit sequences I've ever had the misfortune to sit through.<br/><br/>The animated characters are at best unendearing, at worst outright creepy. From Haddock's piggy little eyes to the oddly life-like yet simultaneously corpse-ish features of the peripheral characters, something clearly went wrong at the effects stage. I'm reminded of the failed attempt to inject realism into the cast of The Polar Express, resulting in a variety of horrible computer generated manikins somewhat akin to, but not quite precisely like Tom Hanks if Tom Hanks were to be returned from the dead without his soul.<br/><br/>The heir apparent to Red Rackham is the most disconcerting in terms of inhuman humanisation, being the least cartoonish of the animated cast his obviously unreal features are the most wrenching. His face is beautifully modelled, but only in the same way that a waxwork is beautifully modelled. His expressions never quite come to fruition and it's often hard to tell where his eyes are pointing, giving the impression that this might not be an animation at all but live action featuring bored actors in masks.<br/><br/>Where the animation succeeds in boiling over to nuclear proportions is in the action sequences, from the breath-stealing view of a Moroccan coastal town to the eye-popping gorgeousness of The Unicorn surging through mountainous waves. The battle between Red Rackham's ship and The Unicorn, while ludicrously over-dramatic, will satisfy even the most demanding eye-candy addict.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the emphasis in Tintin was always on exposition, soliloquy, thoughtful puzzle solving and unlikely gun fights in which nobody gets hurt or bleeds. This all lent itself uncommonly well to Herge's comic book format; neat and precise as the lines of the figures he drew and the frames within which their adventures unfolded. But on the big screen it makes for a long-winded and awkward experience. And rather than embellish the moments of calm, the sudden and explosive action sequences work only to throw the intelligent aspects into stark relief.<br/><br/>I wanted to love this movie. But I've suspected for a while now that Spielberg is in some kind of artistic decline and did not, for this very reason, raise my hopes particularly high. So I didn't love it, though it was somewhat entertaining."
"mvmarianisenlle","6","1","2","20 March 2012"," Nothing extraordinary
","I think the problem was my expectations were so much higher than what the movie turned out to be. <br/><br/>The story is quite mediocre and the characters are not as fully developed as they should have been for such a big production. I mean, the ""bad guy"" was nothing but plain ordinary and Tintin... quite the disappointment in my opinion. Then there was the problem with the design of the animation. In my opinion, it wasn't well done. I would have preferred it with real actors. It would have done a better job at catching my attention instead of being distracted by the lack of emotion of the characters. This movie with a good lead actor would have been another thing entirely.<br/><br/>The only two good things on it are Snowy and the drunken captain. I would even see the sequel just for the latter! Every bit of his dialogue was hilarious."

The motion capture technique is fascinating and so well-done. Some characters look cartoonish while others look very real; the scenery is strikingly beautiful. The action-packed story is part pirate swashbuckler and part Indiana Jones adventure; the combination makes for a spectacular, witty, and exciting film with a sweet, smart, and very likable young man at its center.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, especially for adults, and you don't have to be familiar with the graphic novel source material to enjoy it."
"kosmasp","9","1","2","13 March 2012"," How could this not be nominated for Best Animated Picture?
","I know it is ""performance capture"" and all, but there are still animators at work here. And they did a terrific job too. Before the Oscar nominations went out, I had one clear winner: This movie as Best Animated Feature. Didn't happen, because it wasn't even nominated. Puss'n'Boots was on the other hand. Really? Nothing against that movie, it's OK, but nominated for best Picture? Really? <br/><br/>But back to this. Not only one of the better animated (actually the best I remember seeing in 2011) movies I saw last year, but also one of the best movies in 2011 period. Spielberg did it again. I can't explain how he did it, but the movie works very well. Great comedy and action value, the set pieces work very good. I even remembered some of the comics (characters) from way back when I read some of Tin Tins comics.<br/><br/>Of course Tintin and the other characters do have many names in different countries. In Germany he's called Tim (the Dog is called Struppi). The original name of the dog also seems to be Milou and not Snowy (though I have no clue what that would translate to). But no matter what you call them, this movie is awesome"
"unrealgeeman","8","1","2","6 March 2012"," Positively surprised. Great movie!
","I had my doubts. <br/><br/>I was never a fan of tin tin as a kid so I saw this movie without ""any"" tin tin background and after reading a few reviews, that was probably the best, since many users can't really accept this as a ""tin tin"" movie but I don't think it is meant to be linked to the cartoons or comics that much to be honest. I didn't have any problems understanding the story in this one so I'd be so bald to call it completely independent of the cartoons and comic books, so relax. The comics are still there for you tin tin enthusiasts who can't accept this version of tin tin :) <br/><br/>I think the script is very good. I enjoyed this movie a lot.<br/><br/>I find Cap'n Haddock hilarious. The British humor is boiling out of his ears in this one. I would say Haddock's character in this movie is like Jack Sparrow in the curse of the black pearl mixed with a little monty python and a brilliant accent. A drunken sailor that somehow succeeds in the end.<br/><br/>The animation and graphics are surreal. I saw that some reviews said otherwise and that is beyond my understanding. This movie is gorgeous, you can't deny that even if you didn't like the script. <br/><br/>I do have to say that I did find the middle part a little bit dull but Haddocks moments really made this movie. Hilarious and I repeated them every five minutes in my head and found myself laughing every time the rest of the day.<br/><br/>Great movie for the family i'd say. No blood btw for y'all thinking of showing your kids this.<br/><br/>I can't rate this as some users as a tin tin movie since I have little to no experience of the tin tin character but I can rate this a a family comedy, and it really was entertaining."
"TheDoomSong","5","1","2","4 March 2012"," Tintin is not and never was Indiana Jones
","""The Adventures of Tintin"" starts out strong and quickly loses story, logic and heart in a plethora of over the top action sequences that feel so incredibly close to Indiana Jones that one might start to think Spielberg wanted to make up for the disastrous ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"".<br/><br/>That first half an hour of ""Tintin"" stays very close to the comic book and that's when the movie is strongest. The CG animation is absolutely gorgeous and the transition of Hergés drawing to the big screen is a success.<br/><br/>But as the movie progresses it gains speed and loses almost everything else. And that's not because Spielberg decided to blend different stories to one adventure. If that's the only thing he'd have done, we'd still be left with plenty of Hergé's brilliant stories and witty dialogue. It's because Spielberg cannot help himself and drowns the movie in big setpiece action sequences which are either ludicrous, or feel like they belong in an Indiana Jones movie. (In one case Spielberg actually uses an action sequence that was scrapped from ""Raiders""). John Williams' score does not help at all, because it too borrows heavily from his own compositions for the Indy movies.<br/><br/>Spielberg doesn't stop at that. Haddock's memories of his grandfather and Reckham the Red are presented visually and in full detail. And what Haddock remembers has nothing to do with captains, ships and pirates but instead feels like a copy of the overblown sea battle in the third ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie.<br/><br/>All in all ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is too loud, fast and grand. It lost the beauty and cleverness of the comics and feels like it was made for an action-hungry ten year old Transformers fan instead of a fan of the comics."

I read them 10 times each. REAL TALK. (kevin hart fan right here) Long story short, the movie was nothing like the books. It was a collection of meaningless action sequences. There is no depth, suspense or atmosphere. Also the animation didn't do anything for me. <br/><br/>However, despite its flaws, its still a Tintin movie which has Daniel Craig.

For a generation of fans who were living on a daily diet of TINTIN's adventures the characters in this movie may seem hollow like the wooden Pinochio. Also Captain Haddock is so pitiable ,not like the fiery self in the comics.The element of violence in the movie shows that the director doesn't understand the philosophy of comics like TINTIN or Asterix or animations of Hayao Miyazaki where characters are not divided into good and bad , they are simply human beings with all the failings ."

","First of all, I really wanted to like this movie. As someone who grew up reading the stories, my whole family and I were excited about seeing it. But here's why it didn't work. The beginning cinematography was beautiful and reminded me of colored pencil drawings (like the book). Also, I paid the additional money for 3D, which I liked, when it appeared. But the 3D was severely underutilized. The movie disintegrated into good cinematography and poor character development. Just like in the books, when we first meet Captain Haddock, he is a literal ""wreak"". But, in the movie is he never allowed to move beyond a immature drunkard. He never becomes worthy of respect. (The crane fight, BTW, was silly and unnecessary.) Hollywood interfered again by turning Tintin's race to get the ship into a cataclysmic event that destroyed a city. Hello? This is Tintin! He slips in, he slips out, he gets the job done. If only the director's could have trusted us to have a good time without unnecessary destruction and drama in the movie. The details of the books are not dramatically dangerous and exciting 100% of the time, but along the way, we feel like we get to know the characters. It would be nice of Hollywood to do the same."
"meeza","8","1","2","16 January 2012"," ""Tintin"" is not in the top ten-ten of my favorite movies of the year, but I liked it!
","Steven Spielberg's first computer-animated movie ""The Adventures of Tintin"" marks another gold cinematic star on this master's legendary directorial resume, and also signifies that there is no genre Steven cannot helm. The protagonist Tintin is voiced by Jamie Bell. Tintin is a young intrepid reporter always looking for an adventurous story. He sails on one when he buys a model ship called the Unicorn that includes a scroll that might be the key to a fortune. The problem is that the villainous Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) is hot on Tintin's tail to devour him of the Unicorn with its scroll. However, Tintin is no tonto; and with his magical dog Snowy there is no adventure Tintin can't handle. I love Tintin's cool, calm, and collective demeanor in facing even the most challenging of situations. Tintin teams up with Captain Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis), whose ancestor was the Unicorn's first ship rider, in order to find the other model Unicorns with their treasured scrolls. Spielberg does incorporate the movie with some of his infamous storytelling themes and directorial techniques of his past iconic movies such as ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Catch Me If You Can"", and even ""E.T.""; but in a more fast-paced family entertainment mode. Spielberg's team of screenwriters (Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish) verbally insert the movie with plenty of wit and exhilaration. And how can one not be impressed with the movie's ""true-to-almost-life"" animation. The only knock I have against Tintin , like the movie business itself, is that there was a bit too much piracy in it; at times it seemed like a computer animated version of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At Tintin's End"". Nevertheless, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is tintinlating enough to garner a viewing adventure. **** Good"
"tomhemingway11","9","1","2","10 January 2012"," Spielberg is back on form!
","The Adventures Of Tintin is an absolute joy to watch. For the first time since 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' has Steven Spielberg managed to make an action adventure film on an equally enjoyable level. So trade the fedora hat for a spiky patch of red hair, the snakes for a faithful dog companion, the boulders for tanks and you have The Adventures Of Tintin.<br/><br/>The film follows a winding narrative that puts the young Belgian detective on a worldwide hunt for the lost treasure of the unicorn ship. With the Unicorn, Spielberg has found the perfect MacGuffin which is guaranteed to maintain the audiences interest throughout. Jamie Bell possesses an innocence and an ingenuity that makes Tintin a well rounded, likable character but the REAL treat is about a 1/3rd into the film when Andy Serkis appears as Tintin's 'side-kick'(?), Captain Haddock. The different sides to his character provide great moments of levity; the perfect antidote to the mostly straight faced but kind hearted, Tintin. Other notable actors lend their voices to the film; Daniel Craig sinks his teeth into the role of the antagonist (Playing against type has never been so much fun!), and the double team of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are well cast but possibly under used as the hapless Thompson twins.<br/><br/>Spielberg will impress his audience with the inventive plot and a fantastic cast delivering great performances but does the technology suit the structure of a Tintin story? The answer is a definite YES! Motion capture has moved on since films like 'The Polar Express' and at times during this movie, you will find yourself forgetting you're watching a cartoon. The element of 3D that is offered as opposed to the two-dimensional format (well worth the extra money) compliments the motion capture and has some of the most impressive use of this new format you will ever see. Notice how you can see dust floating in the air and can almost feel the blast of explosions. There are several action scenes that make best use of the 3D involving an edge of your seat, riveting, roller-coaster ride of a chase.(But I don't want to give too much away).<br/><br/>The direction of the film is superb with Spielberg masterfully crafting an engrossing 2 hour old school action adventure movie, with heart, for audiences of every age by including enough stunning use of 3D/motion capture, sticking a few self-referential jokes here and there and most important of all, making it a fun, enjoyable film that will bring a smile to anybody watching. It is not an overlong film and ends just as it may begin to outstay it's welcome by leaving the door open for an inevitable sequel. Peter Jackson... Take the director's chair and try to beat this. Spielberg is back!"

","My best friend went to see this twice before she took me to see it. She's now completely obsessed with it. Me? The best I can say is meh.<br/><br/>The main reason I saw this was for Steven Moffat. I love his work on Doctor Who, he's the best thing that ever happened to the show, but he wasn't up to his old tricks with this. I think I wouldn't have been so disappointed had I not known that one of my favorite writers was involved.<br/><br/>The film was a lot of fun but there was one little thing that bothered me enough to knock 4 points off the score. TINTIN!! Boy was he boring!! He had no personality, he was just sort of a talking cardboard cutout!! I didn't care at all about him!! If he'd been randomly killed off, I wouldn't have felt bad at all. As for the other characters, they were okay but Tintin brought it all down. I liked Snowy a lot and that other guy with them, Haddock or something, he was okay. But I just wanted Tintin off the screen. If that's how he was in the comics, no wonder Americans don't know who he is. I've never seen a more lifeless character in my entire life and that's saying a lot considering I've seen some pretty awful movies with horrible actors. But I felt like whoever played Tintin didn't have anything to work with and that's the fault of the writers, which brings me back to my immense disappointment with Steven Moffat. I mean this is the guy who wrote for the 11th Doctor, my favorite Doctor of all time, and he didn't give Tintin any personality.<br/><br/>And of course I could go on and on about the over the top, self indulgent ending that screamed ""OF COURSE THIS MOVIE WILL HAVE A SEQUEL, YOU'RE PAYING FOR IT!!"" While the movie was good in its own right, I won't be seeing the sequel."
"BigWhiskers","7","1","2","8 January 2012"," Ambitious but kind of falls flat
","I've never read the comic book or watched the nick cartoons of Tin Tin so I went into this movie without any type of expectations which is good. Most animated films that have so much money tossed into them with big name directors and voice over actors tend to get so busy and overblown that you forget what the heck it is you're watching. With Tin Tin, it is a mixture of Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean -a lot of action with some humor thrown in. The movie does give you lots of eye candy but the characters do seem to babble on especially Captain Haddock who comes across as an alcoholic schizophrenic - the movie may be nickelodeon backed but it's really hardly something for kids with all these references to alcoholism,mental breakdowns and violence. It wasn't rated PG with cutesy in mind. The plot revolving around a sunken treasure ship and those who will do anything to get it has some fun but in the end it falls flat due to too much going on and not enough fleshing out of the characters. For those like me who knew nothing of the stories beforehand that helps instead of filling up the screen with car chases and unbelievable escapes - entertaining but doesn't tell a good enough story. 7/10."
"asetoyan","7","1","2","26 December 2011"," Spielberg would've have done a better research
","Modification of the story-line was surprising and somehow awkward. Milou's (Snowy's) gestures were understated, this dog jumps out of the album when you read the comic, I expected more from the animation. Captain Hadock's nose was an exaggeration, the Duponts (Thompson's) and Nestor are fit in a tintinophile's memory. In my opinion the technique of the fading from a scene to another, in the couple of instances, although creative, didn't belong to this adventure. The scene where the blue suited man pointed to letters in a newspaper with blood, was silly, a Spielberg scene is expected to be of a higher standard. On the other hand I should praise the character of Tintin, Alan and couple of the Captain's crew, they were well represented!"

","Highly anticipated film especially in the French speaking world. First, visually the film is amazing. The true to life reproduction of Hergé's universe is without reproach. The original story taken from unrelated stories in the series is also very interesting. We were well warned and is easily accepted. We really get the impression of seeing a whole new adventure without knowing what will come next. What comes next, are characters that are underdeveloped. This is particularly true of the two main heroes, Tintin and Haddock. The exception here might be Snowy. We don't find the essence of their personalities so well defined trough the 24 albums of the series. Where are all of Haddock's unique expressions? This original story is full of totally impossible situations that the albums never reached, which unfolds at a frightening pace. Finally, I found the humour sparse and not really that funny. It's obvious that the market aimed for are the young video game playing boys. If this film brings a whole new generation to Hergé's universe, that would be a good thing. The next film of the series is likely to be closer to the essence of Tintin, as Peter Jackson will be the director. He is admittedly a Tintin fan since his childhood. Spielberg came to Tintin in his late thirties, after being told of a vague resemblance to a well-known archaeologist."

Firstly the lead character: a jauntily quiffed youth in his original bande dessinée in essence has absolutely zero personality, so without his artistic style, there's very little left to root for.<br/><br/>Secondly, the visual treatment. Is this an animation or is it reality ? It straddles the middle ground between the two and fails to convince us of either. The strongest elements are when the film accepts it's origins and is overtly cartoony: Snowy and Haddock, playing for laughs work well. The CGI however only really feels justified in action, in particular an exuberant extended chase, here the technology genuinely adds something so kinetic, imaginative and crazy it belongs in a comic. I can't help thinking that if the film had either focused on being a fully live action or a living 3D treatment of Hergés style it might have been more successful.

"dvc5159","7","2","7","6 November 2011"," For 1 hour and 40 minutes I was a kid again
","There was a time where kids found entertainment by reading the daily comics or even buying them at the local bookstore, awaiting the adventures of their favorite superhero. ""Tintin"" was my childhood favorite, and although it wasn't in English when I read it, they were (and still are) extremely exciting and humorous page-turners.<br/><br/>I've always awaited the next one, but I was disappointed when I found out that the comics were old and that the author had already died. I wasn't disappointed that they were old, heavens, no - I was disappointed that there were no more adventures of that intrepid reporter, his faithful dog, and his wide variety of friends and enemies that always makes for such an exciting read. Years later the 1991 animated series popped up on Cartoon Network Asia, and it was a fixture for me. The series is brilliant - as loyal as a Belgian animated series could be. I've always thought that if Hollywood decides to make a movie, the only person who could've done it and pulled it off was Steven Spielberg (""Indiana Jones"" took inspiration not only from James Bond but also from Tintin).<br/><br/>Flash forward to 2011. Spielberg was directing, and both he and ""Lord of the Rings"" Peter Jackson are producing it. I became hugely excited. Despite knowing that it was going to be filmed in 3D animation, I walked into the (2D) theater with high expectations. And despite its flaws and slight deviations from Herge's comics, I was not disappointed. There was a sigh of relief - a ringing thought that kept saying ""Spielberg has done it.""<br/><br/>""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a great film for the family to be on the edge of their seats. The plot is ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" dashed in with bits of ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"". The mystery and intrigue are combined with engaging and at times outrageous/hilarious action sequences - one of which is a seamless, spectacular one-take chase scene which exudes a high energy level not sensed since those in the ""Indiana Jones"" films - there's a real high sense of adventure throughout the film. The effects are top notch and apparently show the best of motion-capture technology - it is so good that I forgot that I was watching merely animated characters and that I was watching a comic book unfold on the big screen. Spielberg and Jackson have triumphed with the motion capture here, making Robert Zemeckis' previous runs with the technology look pale in comparison. Crisp and colorful cinematography by Janusz Kaminski, fluid editing by Michael Kahn and yet another lively and bombastic score by John Williams make this an even more entertaining watch.<br/><br/>As for the good (motion capture) acting, Jamie Bell captures the Tintin character nicely. His look and speech is there - as well as his sense for intrigue. Andy Serkis is wonderful as the grizzled Captain Haddock - his comic timing and gruff voice perfectly embodies the character - although there are moments which makes the character too goofy, even more than his comic counterpoint. I didn't even realize it was Daniel Craig as the voice of the villain Sakharine with a slight dastardly sneer in his voice. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost don't get enough screen time as the dim-witted twin detectives Thomson and Thompson but their silliness matches the comics' counterparts but I feel it is not as humorous as when I first read it. They get the job done, though.<br/><br/>Somehow I don't like plots which are cobbled up from lots of different plots into one. They just don't blend together nicely, and this film is no exception - this being its biggest flaw. Right from the start of the movie (after the stylish beginning credits similar to Spielberg's own ""Catch Me If You Can"") the film never really focuses on its characters and goes straight for the mystery and the story. Haddock even takes center stage in many scenes instead of the titular Tintin. The characterization is at the mercy of the action-packed spectacles, and heart-pounding intrigue. It's a shame because the characters are interesting by itself - intelligent and spontaneous (Tintin and Snowy), cantankerous (Haddock), dastardly (Sakharine), silly (Thomson and Thompson), but not insulting to the audience nor stereotyped. If the film had 20 extra minutes devoted to its characters, then we just might have the first CG-animated motion capture classic. It's a bit of a shame, really.<br/><br/>Despite it's flaws, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a rollicking good time at the movies, a serial adventure with lots of action, excitement and humor, and perfect for families with its lack of adult content (apart from alcohol content and some intense action sequences). The effects are seamless and easy on the eyes (haven't seen the 3D version yet - though I've heard its very good). This is truly a Spielberg film - his entertainment sense still going strong.<br/><br/>For 1 hour and 40 minutes I was a kid again, fists clenched during the action sequences. Yet the characterization and their motives do not get their due, but I suspect that this was merely a way to introduce the world of Tintin to today's fast-paced audiences, and predicting that if they loved it, the characterization will be put into the sequels. Something like that. Maybe. Here's hoping.<br/><br/>It isn't as brilliant as the comics or the TV show but you could do much worse than ""Tintin"", because at least it doesn't have pointless action, choppy editing or shaky camera to ruin the effects; or cardboard, stereotyped characters to chew the scenery. ""Battle: Los Angeles"" or ""Transformers"" anyone?<br/><br/>Overall rating: 80/100"

","first of all i am a big fan of TinTin so i already watched the movie while i knew the story, so of-course the story was great for me from the start ! but from the movie the Side the 3D was awesome ! of the best 3D i saw ever close to reach Avatar 3D and maybe passed it in some sense !, music was good but could be better! the flow of the action and sequence was as i Expected or even more, fast no time to take your breath the only thing i didn't like was the very BIG nose of every one, Hadok character had a big nose but not this big ! same for detectors ! if you are a big fan of TinTin then watch it you wont regret it, if u do not even know who in hell is Tin Tin then u will feel even better because you do not know the story ! anyway i think they will make a chain of movies after this one ! and for me i am going to attend them all !"
"FantasticFearOfMisterBobo","8","2","7","5 November 2011"," Maybe the most fun i've had all year!
","This review contains no spoilers. I don't normally write reviews for movies but i enjoyed this movie so much and i want to show that a mo-cap movie can be good to all the naysayers. First of all the movie starts with a stylish cartoon opening credit which basically sets up the style of Herge's books and the movie. We are soon brought straight into mystery only 5 minutes into the movie and doesn't stop in to the credits roll. We are introduced to Tintin in a really great way which i won't spoil along with the rest of the movie's great humor which put a smile on my face throughout and will with a lot of kids and adults. Jamie Bell is really great as the the boy journalist setting a real fun and adventure thirsting character like Mr Spielberg's other adventurer. The rest of the cast also shine in their roles with Andy Serkis playing a sublime and brilliant haddock who is a very complex and original character to get adapted to the screen but is pulled off so well by the mo cap master. Even more Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are funniest on screen as the Thompson twins who take on their roles with enthusiasm to give a flawless and and great performance. Finally Craig gives a good performance as Rackman with a evil and typical bad guy role though doesn't shine no way as much as the rest of the cast. However in the end it doesn't come down to one of the human cast to steal the show but tintin's partner and pet snowy with his cuteness and Wit that makes him irresistible to anyone. What makes this movie even better is its use of the mo cap tech which includes some astonishing set pieces which couldn't be caught in real life from a motorcycle chase through the streets of morocco to a OTT crane fight which is so over the top you don't care due to the amazement of it all which Indy 4 failed to do. Really i couldn't expect anything less from writers Moffat, Wright and Cornish who have already created remarkable stuff in their lifetime which is applied to the movie to create a remarkable adventure story with a good plot and some amazing design and love. However this movie does come with some flaws including some bad dialogue throughout the movie and some undeveloped characters which i would have loved to have seen more of. Thought this no way spoils the movie which is the most fun i have had in the cinemas this year. This movie is fun and really funny which never stops. It also includes some of the most breathtaking scenes since avatar with the action and adventure of Indiana Jones. Even more john William's score really fits the movie and once again enhances Mr Spielberg's work. A return to form for one of the best directors of all time."
"PeterRoeder","7","2","8","29 October 2011"," Excellent
","This movie is really excellent. More like an Indiana Jones movie really it grips the viewer from start to finish and you leave the cinema feeling uplifted and better about humanity. Both Tintin's dog and the people in this movie are better than people in real life and that makes it a splendid story. I'm not sure where Hergé got his storytelling drive from but he sure was an excellent storyteller. In another review a user said that the story has been changed but that seems fairly useless to say because the movie does not claim to be an adaption of one comic-book but rather to be based on the whole series. Moreover, the story is quite good, I think. Naturally, it would be logical to adapt Tintin to this modern-day martial artist Bruce Lee/James Bond type of character but actually this is not the case. In the movie he remains the Tintin we know and love from the great comic-books."

","It's school holiday time and I wasn't particularly looking forward to another kids film at the cinema. Tin Tin looked liked the best of a bad bunch of the choice of movies on but I couldn't be more wrong. This was a belter of a film.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg , The Adventures of Tin Tin is the exciting story about three antique model ships and their link with lost treasure . The animation is amazing , maybe the best I have ever seen and I didn't even see it in 3D. It's funny and has non stop action. One scene in particular when Tin Tin is chasing an eagle through a town is fantastic .<br/><br/>If your stuck for something to do this week , you won't go far wrong by taking them to see this brilliant animation."

"saytosandeep","8","1","3","15 March 2014"," MY REVIEW: The Adventure is Out There!!
","Tintin, the name we are familiar with but never know much about him. Legends like Steven Spileberg and Peter Jackson club together and start a new animation franchise The Adventures of Tintin. The first outing is directed by Steven himself. So what is it that makes Tintin movie special? I will say it is the state of the art animation made with the help of motion capture technology, the relentless action drama and detailing which will remind you of Indy movies. Movie never tries to be utterly funny like other animations around; it keeps itself serious about its mission and succeeds by a margin. Although Tintin himself is not a funny guy but his pet Snowy and ally caption Haddok provide enough fun moments. Lack of any female character does not bother. So if you liked Indy movies or Pirate movies then it will sum both of them for you in animation format. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for The Adventures of Tintin. There is sequel planned and this time Peter Jackson will be taking the command and we all know how much Peter loves adventures."
"dromasca","7","1","3","9 February 2014"," an amazing technical experience
","Having made some of the best and some of the most successful movies in the history of film making, Steven Spielberg has nothing to prove to anyone but himself. He is the complete master of the subjects and themes, genres and styles, and I suspect even of the financing of his films. Thus I am not surprised at all to see him pick Tintin as a hero for this film made in 2011 in which he plays on the ground of movies for children while allowing his own childish self to enjoy the making and the story and experimenting with the almost unlimited possibilities offered by computerized animation.<br/><br/>There are two things that I did not like in Spielberg's version of Tintin. One is the de-belgization of the character. Titin as a character has a Belgian flavor and although his appearance and the the one of the surrounding characters created by Herge are respectfully preserved, the rest is all but lost in translation. The second is the fact that there is too much action in this film. Yes, Spielberg is a fantastic action director, but he seems to have become at some point too much absorbed in creating action at the expense of creating emotion. Kids today already have at hand a lot of action movies, TV shows, games. If this is to be a film for kids and if parents take their precious ones to see a film by Spielberg I would expect then to experience emotion and not so much action thrills.<br/><br/>Otherwise The Adventures of Tintin is an amazing technical achievement and a superb visual experience. It's almost a masterpiece in hyper-realistic cartoon making if you believe such a combination exist. I must just honor the names of the people in charge with the art – they are Andrew L. Jones and Jeff Wisniewski. I will be excused however that I expected more from the great film-maker named Steven Spielberg."
"chris-j-ironside","10","1","3","7 November 2013"," Genre defining
","This is the greatest family adventure film I've seen - truly fantastic!<br/><br/>The animation is simply breath-taking and astonishingly lifelike for the most part, the storyline is good (as you would expect from an adaptation of the Herge classic) and it's superbly witty and exciting. I adore this film and have watched it a great many times without tiring (although I will admit the kids sometimes request we watch something different!).<br/><br/>The casting is good, Jamie Bell does a great job as the roving reporter, and Andy Serkis plays a mean Captain Haddock. I am sometimes a little less convinced of Daniel Craig's character (Sakharine), but not enough to damped my enthusiasm for the film. Thomson and Thompson are the best characters in the film, a tribute to Pegg and Frosts ever fruitful partnership. Finally, Snowy, wonderfully brought to life by Peter Jackson's studio: managing to instill a considerable degree of character into a subject with neither facial expressions or vocabulary.<br/><br/>I can't speak highly enough of this film and cannot wait for the next in the series."
"chelz72","5","1","3","14 August 2013"," Lots of gun violence, fighting, and glorification of alcoholism!
","I rented this film to watch with children, ages 7 & 8. It was a good reminder that just because a film is animated and marketed towards children, does not mean it's actually appropriate for them. I was alarmed how much CRIME was in the movie. Breaking and entering, TONS of gun violence and almost every scene consisted of a fist fight. Not to mention the glorification alcoholism- the Captain drank bottle after bottle of whiskey, and when he was sober, he was forgetful. Even the dog slipped him a mickey to get what they wanted out of him.<br/><br/>I'm not a prude, mind you- I love the Asian Extreme directors, Tarantino, and the likes, but I'm an adult with strong critical thinking skills, and my strong critical thinking skills, along with my teaching background and interest in how media effects children prompted me to write this review to warn other parents and caregivers of children to be wary of this film and to remember that animation does NOT equal appropriate."

","Even though, for the most part, I did enjoy The Adventures Of TinTin very much, I found that at a running time of 2.5 hours it constantly cried out for some very serious editing.<br/><br/>I'd say that about a good half hour's worth of sheer uselessness could've easily been axed from this one's story and no one would've noticed the diff one way or the other.<br/><br/>But, of course, at the hands of director Steven Spielberg the viewer was put through a long, drawn-out hell before he came to his senses and got to the story's point.<br/><br/>Yeah. Instead of a quick-paced, tightly packed story of, say, 2 hours, here, way too much time was spent re-telling a tale from yesteryear. And having TinTin take an extended adventure over to North Africa, only to find out (to my growing frustration) that what really mattered when it came to solving the whole mystery of the Unicorn was right back in good, old London.<br/><br/>I don't know about you, but, for me, all of this needless rigmarole only left me with a sense of disappointment in this film's final product."

"siderite","7","1","3","26 January 2013"," Really ridiculous story, but consistent with the original comics and really well done
","This is by no means a masterpiece and, by storyline, one might think it is pretty silly. But if you remember the comics (I know, drawn almost a century ago, pretty hard to remember) they were exactly like this. The focus was on adventure, on the bright reporter Tintin and his faithful dog and the positive, cartoonish way the world is depicted.<br/><br/>The film itself is 3D, which doesn't really help it. And I mean that. I can imagine this in a anime style or even that French style of 2D animation and I believe it would have been better. Also, being the original Belgian comic, it would have made more sense in French. I mean the Tintin and Milou names really do sound better in French. But that doesn't mean the film wasn't really well done, because it was.<br/><br/>I can still remember how it felt when I was reading the comics and it felt funny and dangerous at the same time. When the iconic beads of sweat jumped from Tintin's head I knew things were serious. The film goes too much in the direction of kid films, with very little tension.<br/><br/>I have to conclude, though, that it was a well made film. I didn't enjoy the 3D animation, but it was well done. The story, consistent with the comics, were a bit too childish, but still nice. I wonder what direction they will go in the next series. I really expected less, but I got something outrageously fun. However I do wonder how the new generations will receive it. Will it feel like a weird European Bugs Bunny? Because then they would have completely missed the point. It's all about adventure! The kid version of Indiana Jones."
"brutalkid1997","10","1","3","1 January 2013"," Absolution amazing --- *Contains spoilers!
","Now this is one hell of a movie, Amazing animations and graphics, well directed and perfect yet a tiny bit slow, i'll get to that later on.<br/><br/>Now this movie is ambitious and miles smarter than your average 3-D family film, why, because of the plot the plot was very well done, and the voice acting was superb.<br/><br/>This is the plot so yeah <br/><br/>Tintin (Jamie Bell), a young journalist, and his dog Snowy are browsing in an outdoor market in a European town. Tintin buys a model of a three-masted sailing ship, the Unicorn, but is then immediately accosted by the sinister Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig), and the mysterious figure of Barnaby (Joe Starr), who both try to buy the model from Tintin, without success. Tintin takes the ship home, but it is broken during a fight between Snowy and a neighbor's cat. As it breaks, a parchment scroll slips out of the ship's mast. Snowy spots it but is unable to alert Tintin. <br/><br/>Now the cat got in from the window and the animation for tintin were a little off as he fell on the couch or chair, either way both leather. So apart from this little mistake, it was greatly done Next!<br/><br/>Tintin visits Sakharine in Marlinspike Hall, where he learns that there are two model ships. Tintin puts the scroll in his wallet, only to have his wallet stolen by Silk. (A wallet thief) Later, Tintin is shot at, then abducted by accomplices of Sakharine, and imprisoned on the SS Karaboudjan. On board, Tintin escapes and meets the ship's nominal captain, Haddock (Andy Serkis). Haddock has been supplied with whiskey by first mate Allan (Daniel Mays), who is working for Sakharine, and thus is permanently drunk, and unaware of the happenings on board his ship. Tintin, Haddock, and Snowy eventually escape from the Karaboudjan in a lifeboat. Sakharine sends a seaplane to find them, which the trio seize and use to fly towards the (fictitious) Moroccan port of Bagghar, but they crash in the desert.<br/><br/>Now in this part things get weird on the plane but they were all accurate, for comedy anyway. This movie only gets better as you'd think, its a kids movie, no guns no blood, nope a guy gets shot up then writes a message to tintin with his blood on a newspaper.<br/><br/>Dehydrated in the heat, and suffering from a sudden lack of alcohol, Haddock hallucinates, and starts to remember stories about his ancestor, Sir Francis Haddock (Andy Serkis), who was captain of the Unicorn during the 17th century. Sir Francis' treasure-laden ship was attacked by a pirate ship, led by the masked Red Rackham (Daniel Craig), and, after a fierce battle and eventual surrender, Sir Francis chose to sink the Unicorn, and most of the treasure, rather than allow it to fall into Rackham's hands. It transpires that there were three models of the Unicorn, each containing a scroll. Together, the scrolls will reveal the location of the sunken Unicorn, and its treasure.<br/><br/>Yea he loses it but for a good cause, and the action sequence on the ship was awesome. Realistic and amazingly done. Next!<br/><br/>The third model ship is in Bagghar, in the possession of the wealthy Omar Ben Salaad (Gad Elmaleh), but it is encased in a bullet-proof glass display case. Sakharine's plan is to stage a concert involving famous diva Bianca Castafiore (Kim Stengel), the ""Milanese nightingale"", whose penetrating singing voice will be able to shatter the glass case, allowing Sakharine's trained hawk to fly down and steal the third scroll<br/><br/>She really was very high pitched, unforgivably i know nothing of opera as i can not stand it, so she so high pitched she shattered all the glass, including bulletproof glass. Other then that haddock wanted another beer, great message for the kids, and then screws up, great message for kids, they then have an amazing fight sequence.<br/><br/>After a chase down to the harbor, pursued by Tintin and Haddock, Sakharine finally escapes with all three scrolls. Tintin chases him back to Europe and arranges a police reception for him on the dockside. Haddock and Sakharine, who is revealed to be the descendant of Red Rackham, replay their ancestors' swashbuckling sword fight, using dockside cranes, swords, and even bottles of whiskey. Haddock is eventually victorious and Sakharine is promptly arrested by Thomson and Thompson<br/><br/>This fight scene was long, well animated and well performed.<br/><br/>With the three scrolls in their possession, Tintin and Haddock find that the indicated location is Marlinspike Hall, and that the hall had been built originally by Sir Francis Haddock. There, in the cellar, they find some of the treasure, and a clue to the location of the sunken Unicorn. Both men agree to continue the adventure.<br/><br/>So the plot is great, the animations are amazing and this was overall 10/10- it was slow in places yet it fitted well. Recommended."
"jboothmillard","6","1","3","23 September 2012"," The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn
","Based on the popular comic books by Belgian animator Hergé, when I was a kid I used to love the cartoon, from the theme tune to my favourite character Captain Haddock and his catchphrase ""blistering barnacles"", and I was definitely interested to see if writer Edgar Wright, producer Peter Jackson (Heavenly Creatures, The Lord of the Rings) and director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) could create a great motion capture computer animated version. Basically young reporter Tintin (Billy Elliot's Jamie Bell), with his dog Snowy, is in a European market and buys himself a model of the Unicorn, the three-masted armed naval sailing ship, and he is approached by sinister Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and the mysterious Barnaby (Joe Starr) who both want the model ship, but they don't get it. When Snowy gets into a squabble with a cat Tintin drops the model ship, unknowingly breaking out a parchment scroll that rolls out of the mast and under a chest, but the dog can't get his master to retrieve it, and Tintin wants to find out more about the Unicorn from someone who may know more than he is letting on. After an encounter with incompetent detectives Thomson (Nick Frost) and Thompson (Simon Pegg), Tintin goes to see Sakhaine, who has another model of the ship, and after returning to his place he finds it ransacked, but Snowy points him to the secret scroll, which he reads before putting it in his pocket which is stolen by pickpocket Aristides Silk (Harry Potter's Toby Jones). The young reporter ends up shot and kidnapped by the thugs of Sakharine, and he wakes up on the SS Karaboudjan, where he meets Captain Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis) who has been made permanently drunk with tons of whiskey supplied by Allan (Plus One's Daniel Mays), but he helps him and his dog get away in a lifeboat. After being attacked by a seaplane, that they manage to bring down and use to fly to Morocco, the trio end up in the desert during a storm, and in the heat, dehydration and lack of alcohol Haddock hallucinates his ancestor's life, captaining the Unicorn during the 17th Century. His memories see Sir Francis Haddock (also Serkis) battling against Red Rackham, the descendant of Sakharine (also Craig), who was trying to steal the priceless treasure on board the ship, and Sir Francis chose to sink the ship rather than let other pirates get the treasure, and there are three model ships with clues as to the location of the shipwreck and the fortune. Tintin has two of the scrolls, and the last one is guarded in the home of wealthy Omar Ben Salaad (Gad Elmaleh) in a bulletproof display case, and Sakharine plans to distract people with famous diva Bianca Castafiore (Kim Stengel) in a concert and use her voice to shatter the glass, and this does work. But Tintin, Haddock and Snowy manage to get the third scroll before the bad guys, and a big chase ensues to keep hold of it, but the villain manages to steal all three and get away, but there is an arrangement where the police gather back in Europe, Sakharine and Haddock combat, and at the end Thomson and Thompson arrest the criminal mastermind. The end of the film sees Tintin and Haddock, with Snowy of course, work out the key to the three scrolls and the puzzle, which leads them to Sakharine's place, Marlinspike Hall, and in a further part of the cellar they find some of the famous Unicorn treasure, as well as a clue to where the rest of the treasure can be found, and Tintin and Haddock agree to go on an adventure. Also starring Mackenzie Crook as Tom, Tony Curran as Lieutenant Delcourt and Cary Elwes as Pilot. Bell is a good choice to play the young adventuring journalist, Serkis does well as the drunken captain and faithful friend to the hero, Craig in near unrecognisable as the sinister villain, and Frost and Pegg do get some giggles, it is a little odd that Professor Calculus is missing. The motion capture animation, where the actors play out the scenes and it is animated over, is clever, Spielberg certainly puts creative filmmaking into the action which is full excitement and fun, the big chase for the three scrolls is a continuous shot that keeps you watching, is may be paying more attention to thrills than the charming stuff the cartoon created, but overall it is definitely an animated action adventure to see. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music for John Williams, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Film and Best Special Visual Effects, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. The Adventure of Tintin cartoon show was number 77 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Good!"
"tvsterling","10","1","3","9 July 2012"," Pioneering New Style of Filmmaking
","Tin Tin is nothing more nor less than the eventual new prototype of motion pictures. Just like Citizen Kane it represents a watershed, a turning point. Let us compare the film to what it will replace in Spielberg's bag of tricks; The Indiana Jones series. Sad fact is Harrison Ford has, like all human beings, grown old. Not so with Tin Tin. He will be forever young, forever a youth at the threshold of all his adult power; forever fresh faced, no grey to sully the bright red cowlick, no wrinkles will ever spoil the pink smooth skin. Like John Henry vs the Steam Hammer mere flesh is bound to lose. Harrison Ford is mere inferior flesh. Tin Tin will never enter rehab. Perhaps his voice actor or his motion capture double will but they are mere company men on salary or contract & easily replaced. No pique, no fits of ego, ALL the weakness & sins of the flesh ended at a stroke. NO PRIOR COMMITMENTS. He will always OK the script and he works cheap. NO 50% of the gross for his services; The whole persona package a mere fraction of a star in his or her prime. As long as a backup of the computer models exists somewhere in any computer, anywhere even a hundred years hence there can be a Tin Tin revival whenever the public is willing to watch & be entertained by one.<br/><br/>Back to comparing The assumed retired Indiana Jones epics. Do you realize what the bill would have been to wrangle the cars, ships, planes & other assorted vehicles that added such variety & interest to the movie? ASTRONOMICAL. Many would have to be cheated out of less valuable cars etc & NOWHERE near the realism of the street traffic could be generated at ANY COST. Could any production company afford to crush a classic Rolls Royce Limousine such as the villain's? Crash land a Bellanca in a howling storm? The Indiana Jones movies must have allowed legions of studio carpenters & prop-makers to acquire a tidy retirement. Ditto for the costumers & make up artists.<br/><br/>The movie has a vast sweep of period cities & exotic locales. The bill for Security Alone in let's say, Tangier as a close guess for the sultan's palace sequence would cover the CGI for ALL the locales in the movie. Boys & girls the game is over. Movie making is a money making business & when a world class action adventure movie with non stop camera movement & virtually no limits on ANY & ALL production values can be knocked together for a mere $130,000,000 & post an immediate gross of $371,940,071 well then the writing is on the wall. Bear in mind that this film pioneered the new production style. It will be even cheaper once this is routine. The film is way outside the traditional fairy tale or fantasy realm; That is the essential difference. This new sort of photo realistic CGI might not appeal to older film audiences & a few might even reject the look but almost everyone else will be vastly entertained & THAT is the object of the exercise, to entertain. This, due to the business parameters that it shatters is the future of film.<br/><br/>As for the film content itself; Vastly amusing & exciting entertainment. A worthy successor to the Indiana Jones series. I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br/><br/>As an after thought I feel I should credit Zack Snyder's ""300"" as the forerunner of the new style & technology. The term 'Virtual Back Lot' has been bandied about; seems to me an apt name. However; It takes a Spielberg with his massive administrative talent to truly turn the corner & that would be ""Tintin""."
"daddysarm","8","1","3","12 May 2012"," good movie PLUS you can watch with your kids. Thumbs up BUT
","I have to say the screenplay/plot was a mish-mash. Did they just throw a bunch of Tintin stuff together? The character ""motivations"" & the plot contrivances were also weak.

But Tintin & Snowy spend 20 minutes in the house & ""VOILA!"" The actions of the butler & who exactly he IS were also just ""VOILA!""

"TxMike","Null","1","3","8 May 2012"," Wonderful, cutting edge motion-capture animation, but for me a 'so-so' film.
","This movie, 'Tintin', of course got a lot of advanced publicity and true to its producers and directors is a smashing success. It is hard to say how it could have been improved. It certainly reminds the viewer of scenes from 'Raiders' and young Tintin certainly is an Indiana Jones type of action hero. <br/><br/>But I watched it with a general low level of interest. I can suspend by disbelief when I am viewing real actors playing roles. Especially when the action includes things that 'seem' possible. However viewing animated characters do things which seems impossible, for me, is akin to watching old Roadrunner and Wylie Coyote cartoons.<br/><br/>The plot is fine, young Tintin is wandering through a flea market and buys an old model ship, which his cat and dog fight in his apartment breaks off the mast. Inside the mast he finds a metal tube with something written on a piece of parchment. Soon his apartment is robbed and the model stolen. He eventually learns that three models were built and each had a message, when put with the other three may give directions to a great hidden pirate treasure.<br/><br/>So this takes Tintin and old sea captain Haddock on a harrowing journey all over the world, repeatedly narrowly escaping capture and/or death. And eventually to the treasure. <br/><br/>Jamie Bell is super, voicing Tintin. As well as Andy Serkis voicing Captain Haddock. Plus the villain is voiced by Daniel Craig. Plus a bunch of other established actors. <br/><br/>There is an interesting 8-minute DVD extra on how the Tintin movie came to be, including a clip from something Peter Jackson put together, with his own face for Haddock. And, in fact in the movie itself Haddock looks mostly like Peter Jackson. <br/><br/>Tintin's face and expressions looked very familiar to me and very much like a red-headed version of Nathan Corddry who plays Adam on the TV series 'Harry's Law' starring Kathy Bates. It had me wondering if they used him as a model for the animated Tintin.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: After Tintin and Haddock managed to get all three parchment notes, superimposing them and looking at the characters through light formed geographic coordinates, and when they followed them to an old mansion found it was Haddocks's and a hidden basement contained treasure."
"urchinltd","10","1","3","9 April 2012"," Total value for the money
","Its very rare these days to leave a cinema feeling totally satisfied from all the expense but Tintin ticked all the boxes. How anyone can rate it 2 stars of less is beyond me. They obviously have agendas I cant comprehend. Some of the purists have negative comments but then who would want to make it like the original concept which would have been impossible to commercialise. I have seen the Toys stories and the Smurfs and have a reasonable grasp on what deserves a 10 or a 1 star and TinTin definitely a 10 with all the family excited all the way through. Can work out why IMDb have a 1 star review on the home page when its got a 7.5 general rating ??? Definitely a must see for film for all the family !!"

Having seasoned motion capture actor Andy Serkis (Gollum, King Kong, Caesar) on board would have been a big help i'm sure... Great story, great pacing, great score, great drama, great action.... The best adventure story since ""Raiders of the Lost ark"" all those years ago. Just go see it... Now.. Why are you still reading? GO NOW! ""Whats that Snowy?"""

","TINTIN is the best movie of the year, and Steven Spielberg's best movie in more than a decade. The movie is fun, exciting, hilarious, creative, awesome, and, in the final scene profound.<br/><br/>Some people complain about motion capture animation, but I've always found the complaints exaggerated and ignorant. Animation is not supposed to have the same degree of facial expression as a great live-action actor. And, any complaints about the facial expressions in the TINTIN movie are even more ridiculous when considering that the main character in the original comic has pinprick eyes!<br/><br/>THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN is an exhilarating, family friendly roller coaster ride. The action is thoroughly exciting. Spielberg introduces the three heroes in a steady, captivating way so that the story's frenetic action doesn't get in the way of one's sympathy for them. The comedy is playful and perfectly pitched. It adds immensely to the fun. Also, the motion capture animation is beautifully detailed.<br/><br/>TINTIN is a throwback to Steven Spielberg's earlier work. In fact, his classic movie RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK reportedly was compared in France to the Tintin comic books on which this movie is itself based, and that's the movie this movie most resembles.<br/><br/>Best of all, TINTIN has a strong moral, redemptive world view. (SPOILERS FOLLOW) Good conquers evil, an alcoholic sidekick finds sobriety, and the villain goes off to jail instead of being killed. THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN also has positive overt references to the Cross on which Christ suffered and died for our sins. That's actually one of the clues to where the treasure lies. Also, at the climax of the whole story, there's an overt reference to ""St. John the Evangelist,"" the man who wrote the Gospel of John, the Book of Revelation, and three epistles in the New Testament. This content gives the movie a strong Christian allegorical, symbolic, or metaphorical sense where light from the ""sun"" reveals the final clue to the mystery of the hidden treasure. The light from the desert sun also helps sober up Captain Haddock enough so he can tell Tintin the story about how his ancestor's treasure got lost in the first place. Of course, in TINTIN, the treasure is gold and jewels, a family treasure. All this imagery, however, suggests that it's at the foot of the Cross, in the light that Jesus offers to all men (John 1:9), where one's true treasure lies. That's the best message you can send to any audience any time."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","3","21 February 2012"," Outstanding action
","I saw Tintin with no expectations, having never read a single one of the comics. Suffice to say I had a pretty good time with it.<br/><br/>The plot itself is the usual formula for a film like this. While the opening credits were brilliant, I was losing more and more interest with it in it's first act. The reason is because the characters are never developed enough for us to care greatly. I was interested in the least, but I wasn't incredibly intrigued by them. The way the plot was unfolding was becoming way too dull, but then the film did a 180. When? When the action started of course.<br/><br/>I don't mean to sound like action was what I come to expect to any film like this, but it greatly improved this film. It's one of the most action-packed films of the year, moreso than I would have thought. There are a countless number of outstanding action sequences, and I mean outstanding! The sweeping cinematography during these action pieces, along with the roaring and impressive sound effects and the perfectly balanced score really bring magic to it in ways you wouldn't expect. Like I said, there are a lot of fantastic action scenes here, not just a few. <br/><br/>I really liked this film, but it's only because of what I mentioned. As a whole, the storyline is pretty thin, and the dialogue often dull, if at times funny. This needed a stronger management of the plot and more fully-developed characters. Still, it's hard to really look a the negative side here. Since the film rarely slows down, it's always moving, always very entertaining and always roaring with energy. Did I mention the incredible action sequences? Oh, and forget Uggie from The Artist! Snowy is all around perfect and the best dog of 2011!"

","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland <br/><br/>As if an adventure monster had vomited all over the screen, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a non-stop adventure film adaptation from a beloved European adventurous comic series. But while it holds that Spielberg-ish Indiana Jones archetype and an all-star cast of voices (including the likes of Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Toby Jones) it does get to a point where if you are not invested in the (over-excitable) Tintin character, then you simply won't care about the story itself (visuals aside). Directed and co-produced by the aforementioned Steven Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can) and co-produced by visual genius Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) using the highest caliber stop-motion animation (maybe ever seen), ""The Adventures of Tintin"" exhibits the partnership of two great directors, in conjunction with a quirky, yet (at times) only slightly entertaining interpretation of what European children's mysteries are all about. OK, so maybe the reason why I am so lukewarm about this material isn't because it didn't look nice (because it does) or didn't contain an adventurous story (because it does that too); but speaking as an admitted novice to the beloved tales of Tintin, the adventure and the characters all were such that I really felt no attachment to anything on-screen as the million dollar climax approached. In this reviewer's opinion, ""The Adventures of Tintin"", while visually stunning, may leave many American audiences with a storyline which they may inevitably become bored with.<br/><br/>The story follows an all-too-nosy boy named Tintin, who is (from the visual exposition) a part time reporter, part time amateur sleuth and part time ambiguous teenage nuisance. Within the first two seconds of the film he becomes involved in a storyline centering around an obnoxiously alcoholic Sea-Captain, the sinister Mr. Sakharine (the bad guy) and their quest for a model ship, which is thought to lead to three sought after scrolls, which could lead to some sought after treasure. From there Tintin's adventure sends him and the Captain all over the world, as we soon find out that this young boy's thirst for adventure is only rivaled by the Captain's thirst for alcohol. With action sequences of a fairly high caliber and some of the most illustrious, wide scoping CGI generated landscapes, there is no question that Spielberg knows how to direct the hell out of a film; no matter what genre. Where this film falls apart though is with the actual story and its connection, or lack thereof, with audiences. Spielberg and Jackson assume that everyone going to see a movie about Tintin is familiar, if not a huge fan of the comic series; big mistake. The fact is, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" contains almost no back-story and simply hurls the audiences right into a mystery with no real rhyme or reason. And while this may work for the devoted followers of the comic series, for the rest of us, it may feel as if we came into this movie midpoint, thus losing many novice supporters right away. This leads me to the character development. The characters, do tend to get rather annoying, especially because with little set-up it is hard to build connections with any of them. In fact the only character I cared about was the dog, who constantly held a Disney-esque animal lovability throughout. As for Tintin, audiences will either love or hate his personality almost immediately, and the Captain, brilliantly performed by Andy Serkis (or as I like to call him, the future of Hollywood) is a character so dumb and buffoonish that he is, for the most part, unlikable. Long story short, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is not a movie one walks into disinterested in the Tintincharacter and walks out interested in Tintin's plight.<br/><br/>Final Thought: ""The Adventures of Tintin"" may not hold the funniest storyline (with tons of Euro humor), but is clearly, on a purely technical level, one of the best animated films of the year (even though some critics will whine about their love for the forgettable ""Rango""). Why this movie was snubbed from an Academy Awards nomination for Best Animated Film, may serve to be the biggest snub of the season. In saying that, on a purely entertainment level, allow me to reiterate that ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is just OK. And if me saying that has angered you to the point that you decide to leave me a drawn-out comment on how I am just a stupid American or about how you loved reading the Tintin comics as a child, thus if I would have read them then I would have understood the film better, I will have to stop you there because I am only here to review the content of the film itself, not the comic. <br/><br/>Thank you very much!

","Just back from seeing this amazing film. Read the criticisms before I went and was a bit unsure of what to expect. But what a fantastic surprise this film was. A laugh out loud visual feast. The CGI was outstanding, the storyline was very well done, direction was brilliant and disappointed is not a word I would use any where near this film. I grew up in the Tintin era of comics and hardback books,and did not feel at any point that this film deviated from the originals. I could go on for quite a while about the actors who voiced the parts and also the direction and the brilliance of the CGI work but I won't. Great film, go and watch it and enjoy! This film is a glimpse into the future of cinema. To all the die-hards who have knocked this film by not being true to the books and comics, stop taking yourselves so seriously."

","The movie has all the elements i was looking for, the action sequences were simply marvelous. Characters Sir Francis Haddock,Red Rackham brought life into the movie, snowy is amazing and Tintin is exactly how i thought of, his trademark hairstyle and looks are brilliant even the minutest detail was perfectly portrayed. Tintin story needs no review, i was spellbound for the time i was watching the movie, the only word that came into my mind during the movie was ""wow"". This movie is worth watching in 3d and is for people of all ages, its got action its got comedy and most importantly, it has got ""Tintin"". I would recommend this movie to everyone. Hats off to the movie crew,they have done a brilliant job getting Tintin to big screen in 3d."

","I have to start by saying that I'm totally unfamiliar with Tintin. I'd heard that there was a cartoon series years back but had never watched it.<br/><br/>I vaguely remember various controversies about the comic strip being anti-American, pro-nazi or racist. I assumed that these elements would be sanitized from the film.<br/><br/>So going in as a person with an open mind and no expectations? The Adventures Of Tintin is pretty meh. Its not awful but its not good.<br/><br/>Given the high profile names and talent involved it should have been much better.<br/><br/>That's not to say it's all bad. There are a couple of nice moments.<br/><br/>The nice moments probably came from Wright who unfortunately left the picture. I'm deliberately keeping the review spoiler-free plot wise but would add that I don't get this style of animation.<br/><br/>I saw this at a screening but there's been no marketing for this that I've seen.<br/><br/>I think this left me with a similar feeling to Cowboys and Aliens. Not bad but underwhelming and left me with a vague sense of disappointment ."

","Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull was a wonderful entry in the Indiana Jones franchise and was wrongfully hated on by fans of the series, with the Adventures of Tintin there was a much stronger fan base that were anticipating great things from the Master of Film and so was I despite the fact I have never read the comics they have been quickly glanced at by me but nothing more than that anyway the trailers griped me and I got really excited having know that the Master of Film was back directing again after another 3 year absence which is common for him at the moment, anyway did the film meet my expectations or did they sink down faster than Haddock's ship?, well I was wonderfully entertained thrilled jaw dropped and just wonderfully relieved although I was not worried about the film at all I knew it would be wonderfully entertaining I was relieved that Steven Spielberg's directing abilities had not declined or slowed down they were the same as always this film has a wonderfully fast pace to the outstanding action sequences and the breathtaking fluidity of the movement of the camera as we're flying around with Tintin and Haddock as the camera literally is flying around the screen like a balletic movement or performance is simply outstanding film making of the highest standard and Steven Spielberg must be commended for that. Martin Scorsese does not make movies like Steven Spielberg! Martin Scorsese makes the same type of movies over and over again with no versatility or change of style it's boring the only film of his I will ever watch again anyway is Hugo that's an outstanding movie really wonderfully cinematic and a stunning tribute to the old days of cinema just an amazing technical achievement and a great example of how films should be made but aren't anymore which is a deep shame, anyway I bring Hugo up in this Tintin review because Tintin shows us the future of motion picture film making with motion capture technology and Hugo takes us to the old fashioned days of motion picture making with images sound and color, Tintin has an outstanding visual language what I am referring to is how the shots look clearer and the characters feel different and look different because of this motion capture technology which enhances humans's emotions and textures, the technology was perfected in the Lord of the Rings film series over a decade ago to great critical acclaim and admiration by the film industry, anyway why do I love Tintin so much apart from the outstanding motion capture technology and the stunning flying balletic movement of the camera? it's because of the story the characters the locations the performances by Andy Serkis who played Gollum in the Lord of the Rings films and Jamie Bell who I loved in Billy Eliot which I watched recently and adored I love his charming performance in that film really lovely film that one! anyway Snowy's my favourite character in the film he's so lovingly recreated from the drawings I quickly glanced at in the comics an outstanding achievement from WETA Digital the same team who perfected Gollum in the Lord of The Rings and Snowy's emotions are so perfectly recaptured in the film to comic interpretation or at least as I see it!, The Score By John Williams is another masterstroke of film score genius his new themes are perfectly interwoven into the body of the film, it has always interested me that Tintin's theme is not given a full concert arrangement you hear the first few bars of it but that's it it never develops or changes other than the few notes you hear they are always the same notes that you hear every time Tintin is referred too you always hear the same tiny hints of Tintin's theme it's very quick and very sudden like 5 second variants of the same melody or theme there's one melody for Tintin a very quick theme which has always interested me why the main character does not have a fully developed theme in the film and the supporting characters in the film all have fully developed musical identifications Snowy the pirates the villains all have themes outstanding themes all the same which all have concert arrangements I really love Snowy's theme it's really fast like he's running along a garden path or a road that might be one of my favourite themes composed by John Williams it's so perfectly integrated into the character I can't not imagine seeing that character now without hearing his theme that's the outstanding gift of John Williams's music he composes music for the character and so the character becomes ingrained into the musical identity for the film so when we see him on the screen you hear or hum it straight away that's John's gift his skill he is the master of film music and an incredible asset to film scoring! I really love this film because it gives me a wonderful feeling inside of the fact that this is a wonderful family film and an underrated one at that the film was hated and dumped on by the hardcore fans of the comics because they just thought it was another Indiana Jones Film Don't listen to those stupid people they are wrong and stupid and quite pathetic to even suggest that this is just another Indiana Jones film it's not please give this a chance it deserves a chance to be loved and appreciated don't let it go down the same route as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull did when it was forgotten about it does not deserve it, it should not receive such harsh negativity by anybody!"

","Adventures of Tintin, The (2011)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg's first animation movie is also his first in 3-D. Based on the popular comic character, reporter Tintin (Jamie Bell) and the drunken Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) try to discover the three missing pieces that will lead them to a treasure. I must admit that I wasn't aware of the comic, the characters or anything dealing with the subject until I realized that Spielberg's name was attached so obviously I'm not the main target that this movie was going for. Obviously many, many people love this character even if the film didn't go over too well here in America. Considering I wasn't familiar with the subject I left the theater rather amused at how much of a good time I had. I will say that I wasn't overly impressed with the 3-D effects and I had wished that I had gone for the regular version and saved a few bucks. I will also admit that I didn't care too much for the story but it certainly wasn't bad enough to keep me from enjoying the film. What I enjoyed most about the movie is the non-stop action and downright amazing visuals. Many people have compared the film to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARC, which I think is fair but what this movie does is go all out and deliver the type of action and stunts that not even Indiana Jones could pull off. It seems that our two heroes get into every type of trouble imaginable from a ship battle, to being in the sea alone on a small boat to the most amazing scene, which has them on a small plane flying through a deadly storm. I'd be willing to say that this scene alone was worth the price of admission and the level of entertainment here is so strong that what follows almost feels like a letdown. I thought the two actors did a fine job in their roles as did Daniel Craig in his part. Again, I didn't get totally caught up in the story but this might be due to me not being familiar with the work. Still, the terrific direction by Spielberg and the amazing beauty of the visuals make this one worth seeing."
"anwhitver","10","1","4","29 December 2011"," I am stunned
","I was raised on Tintin. When I heard there was going to be a movie, and who was involved in making it, I was filled with a mix of excitement and dread. If there were people who COULD do Tintin justice, this was the right group, but could they pull it off? I saw the previews, and remained skeptical. The animation comes uncomfortably close to the dreaded Uncanny Valley. When the credits started, I had hopes. As I watched the film, I was enraptured. They did it RIGHT! The characters are themselves, the action is thrilling, the humor a mix of slapstick and sharp wit. What impressed me most, however, were the movements. Somehow the film translates the still-panel comic with it's exaggerated stances into motion. I think anyone who knows the comic will see what I mean. It was fresh, new and familiar all at once.<br/><br/>My best advice for someone new to the world of Tintin is to go in with these expectations: 1. The laws of physics are wobbly in Tintin's world. Ignore them. <br/><br/>2. Expect random slapstick and enjoy it.<br/><br/>3. Tintin is Tintin. He is glue of the story that holds the colorful characters about him together. Don't let yourself be disappointed by the unfashionable straight-forwardness of his character. He is what he needs to be."

","When I was watching this movie, I could not get over how terrific the CGI was in this movie. I have not seen CGI better than this. Though, I was also slightly disappointed with the character creations. Mainly because of the big noises. I know that this is considered a cartoon, and have big noses is usual for a cartoon, but I have yet to see a cartoon type thing, whether CGI or not, that looks totally realistic. The look of TinTin compared to the rest of the cast just did not seem to fit for me. That was my main issue. <br/><br/>There were some parts in which I felt the movie dragged a bit. I did think it was entertaining though. I was happy to see Andy Serkis in this. Known for a lot of CGI movies, which seems to be every movie he is in now, he actually has lines in this one. He plays the drunken Captain Haddock, a guy who can not take two steps without having a sip of ye Ole whiskey. Jamie Bell did a great job, fitting the character of the title character. The way his character looked fit with his voice. <br/><br/>You might enjoy it or you might not. The Adventures of TinTin is one hell of a ride, though."

","Fantastic film, being from Spain, I use to own the entire comic book collection, ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" was one of my favorite ones, I remember perfectly spending hours in front of that piece of art. The movie in my opinion is fantastic, both directors really follow Herge's paths, the storyline is suddle and at the same time doesn't loose paste on the action sequences. I loved the colors really close to the sense of color in Herge's collection. The effects were great, the 3D aspect (not being a big fan of it) was treated very careful, this guys did not go all over the top with it. The music in the other had was a little dull, was not bad but considering that ""master"" Williams composed, I was expecting a little more.

"jantoniou","8","1","4","26 December 2011"," Great fun and adventure
","I went into ""Tintin"" knowing virtually nothing about the original Hergé novels other than they were very well-regarded. <br/><br/>Anyway, lacking any bias one way another as a Tintin purist coming into the movie I was primarily interested in entertainment value and it's more than fair to say ""The Adventures of Tintin"" packs a whole lot of entertainment into its lean frame. There's only an infinitesimal amount of room for non- action in this wall-to-wall action-adventure. You don't get much slack to breathe in this romp through a plot that carries you around Europe and North Africa. <br/><br/>Tintin is the perspicacious reporter always on the prowl for a great story. There's no waiting for him to find one. This one turns around a model of a clipper ship called The Unicorn that he finds randomly in an outdoor market. Immediately multiple people descend on him to either attempt to buy it from him or warn him about it. And so begins the bramble of a plot that brings in the sodden Captain Haddock - wonderfully voiced and acted by Andy Serkis - to companion and accelerate Tintin's adventure. In fact, Haddock becomes a crucial component of his story. <br/><br/>There's a lot of fun to be had in ""Tintin,"" a good deal of humor - some great, some not-so-great - and a heap of mind-swerving visual play. It's a bit dizzying at times, but too irresistible to warrant real criticism. From raucous runs through North African towns to flashbacks to a pirate battle that easily rivals any from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series. <br/><br/>""Tintin"" has more than its share of disbelief suspension but that has a natural tendency to happen in a film that is 100% CGI-driven where sometimes animators do things just because they can. Some visual tricks come completely out of nowhere. Not so much bizarre but just kind of out of place - like multiple buildings that move down the hill of that North African town. I didn't get where they fit into the pretty wild action and what the point was. Maybe when I watch it again I will. <br/><br/>That said - the animation is unique and first-rate. Being an homage to Hergé, the character model are quite different and fit what a Tintin purist probably expects; e.g., Captain Haddock's head is unusually large in proportion to his body. <br/><br/>I didn't find issues common with motion capture animation to be much in evidence; i.e., primarily the creepy ""dead eye"" (aka ""Uncanny Valley"") that had largely killed motion capture animation for me and pretty much everyone (e.g., ""Polar Express"" and virtually anything done by the Robert Zemeckis'/Disney's now-defunct Imagemovers Digital). Though some have taken umbrage with this and think the glassy-eyes and waxy skins are still there, I was actually struck by the realism of the animation, primarily of Tintin himself - though clearly Haddock and the ""Thomson Twins"" are intentionally cartoonish. Somehow it all works though. <br/><br/>Overall ""Tintin"" is tremendously entertaining, a great adventure and plot that keeps your pulse racing. Tintin, his trusty dog Snowy, and Haddock are fun and engaging characters you want to spend time with and lose yourself in their world. Easily worth seeing."

","Went along to see this ( at Peter Jacksons 'Roxy theatre - great location) in 3D with my 9 yr old daughter. I thought it may have been more of a boys movie, however that didn't end up being the case. I knew/enjoyed the comics as a kid - however although the characters were all knew to my daughter, she was also impressed. Plenty of action, and a storyline that was easy enough to follow. I felt it kept both kids and parents interested throughout - some of the action sequences were particularly well done. I wasn't too sure about the format i.e. sort of in-between cartoon and realm characters, but it works well in this instance. In usual Jackson/Speiling/Hollywood tradition the ending is left open for a sequel ... which no doubt will follow. I Wont say its an all time great film, but compared to some of the current kids holiday rubbish around ( i.e. chipwrecked ) I think its well worth the entry fee."

","A brief background: It seems that Tintin is popular everywhere in the world except the US. Even Indians have heard of him. My wife was dying to see it, and I had read one volume I bought her; entertaining, but I was certainly not a huge fan.<br/><br/>Now the movie: very entertaining film. The film tries not to stray away from the depictions of many of the characters of the comic, as well as mannerisms. You certainly won't get the same style of storytelling that you saw in the Herge comics, but the story is as intricate and fun to follow as Spielberg's previous adventure outings. Caat is excellent in all respects, especially Andy Serkis as Captain Haddock. While the action may be more dynamic than what was in the Tintin comics, it is certainly fun and exciting. The CGI is great, especially for translating a comic (a live film would have only detracted from the storytelling). And all this was without watching the 3D version.<br/><br/>Overall, even if you have never heard of Tintin, or are vaguely familiar, it will be a fun ride."

","I am a big fan of the Tintin comics since my schooldays and for 2 hours I was a child once again.<br/><br/>The movie is combination of comics The Crab with the Golden Claws, Secret of Unicorn and ending of Red Rackham's Treasure. The movie includes introduction of Tintin and Captain Haddock from Crab with the Golden claws and rest is from Secret of Unicorn. The only part from comic Red Rackham's treasure is where they find the treasure at Marlinspike Hall. I would have loved if Professor Calculus was introduced. Also I did not like the change where they changed the descendant of Red Rackham was Sakharine but it makes sense for people who have not read books and gives story more depth.<br/><br/>The attention to details given is just fantastic. Like in the opening scene,the background portraits seen are all characters from different comics, the red jeep used in chase scene is same one from The Land of Black Gold and so much more ! If you are as avid fan of books as I am,you will absolutely love it.<br/><br/>Everyone has done great with the character voices.Andy Serkis is undoubtedly the best Haddock ever. A must watch for book fans!"
"jadepietro","7","1","4","22 December 2011"," Tin Tin Jones to the Rescue
","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>The Adventures of Tintin is based on a series of classic comic books created by Georges Remi under the pen name of Hergé. The series was one of the most popular European comics around the 1930's and had a resurgence of popularity in the mid-fifties, when producers Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson were avid fans of the series. Their interest resulted in this starry-eyed 3-D adaptation of this fictional hero and his exploits. <br/><br/>This animated version of Tintin is an energetic lark. Back then, the stories were humorous adventure tales with a tinge of fantasy that fascinated children with their swashbuckling dare- doings. This film gives the characters a more modern look and realistic edge to the original source with a slight Indiana Jones flavor thrown in for good measure. While the film is not always successful in its trendy mix of state-of-the-art animation with its old-fashion storytelling of yore, it is still a worthwhile experience for children and parents to savor and enjoy. <br/><br/>Storywise, the film is a rather routine outing as our hero and his loyal dog, Snowy, go in search of buried treasure. ( The film is based on the first three books from the original series. ) Buying a model of a ship called The Unicorn, Tintin ( Jamie Bell ) encounters Mr. Sakharine ( Daniel Craig ), a baddie who will stop at nothing to find three scrolls that will lead him to wealth and riches. Soon they are all journey bound, along with a drunken Captain Haddock ( Andy Serkis ) and his motley crew, ready for adventure.<br/><br/>The screenplay adaptation by Stephen Moffet, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish does a concise if not exciting job with its subject. There is enough fun and thrills provided for the kiddies, although the film's humor is forced and only moderately amusing. In this version as in the original source, Tintin is the serious type. So much of the liveliness comes from the supporting cast, including Inspectors Thompson and Thompson ( Nick Frost and Simon Pegg ). All of the voice-overs provide the needed zest to the animated characters and their dilemmas. <br/><br/>Yet, some of the charm has been lost in Spielberg's transition to update Hergé's original illustrations with more photo-realistic qualities, a decision that sometimes detracts rather than enhances the film's endearing characters. The realism of some of the film's characters seems totally artificial and contrived, and the rendering of authentic skin tones becomes considerably overambitious and fussy in its detailing. This results in more attention being given to the impressive technique and craftsmanship and less to the overall appearance of Tintin and his entourage. Many supporting characters are just stylized caricatures with exaggerated profiles and grotesque facial features that are at odds with the film's photo- realism emphasis. There remains an overall plastic vagueness in the film's main character, a blandness that persisted in the human forms of earlier computer generated animated efforts like Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express (2004) and Disney's A Christmas Carol (2009) and here, the character design is only slightly improved. ( Perhaps, the media of animation cannot yet master the realities of live action subjects so easily. )<br/><br/>But the film does triumph in its action sequences. The camera's flowing movements and contrasting textures of objects, rather than people, is unparalleled in its artistry. The motion capture technology works more often than not. Shadows and lighting effects produce dramatic results, specifically with reflections found in windows and mirrors. Computer generated vistas of oceans and deserts supply enough local color and their transitions from one scene to the next are seamlessly achieved. The elaborate compositions and unique perspectives make one forget that what is being seen up there on the screen is purely imaginary in its execution. The background details of Hergé's comic book world are quite stunning to behold with certain individual segments generating much wonderment and awe. ( Snowy's car chase, Tintin's motorcycle escape, and the notable pirate sequences are memorable exercises in CGI advancement, skillfully directed by Spielberg and creatively drawn by his talented crew. ) <br/><br/>The Adventures of Tintin is a delightful homage to Hergé's much loved classic tale. This film should result in an even wider audience of today's younger generation of moviegoers. We can now appreciate and admire the craft of two artists with their own worldly visions, brought together to create a lovely cinematic treat for this holiday season.

"Chris_Pandolfi","8","1","4","21 December 2011"," Spielberg Gets Animated
","Like his ""Indiana Jones"" films, Steven Spielberg's ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is a rip-roaring action adventure that takes many cues from the Saturday matinée serials of yesteryear – equal parts detective story, travelogue, chase film, treasure-hunt fable, buddy comedy, and stunt spectacular. The key difference is that it's of the junior division. The age of its hero is never given, and yet he looks and sounds no older than sixteen or seventeen. Naturally, this does not stop him from getting into sticky situations, and it certainly doesn't prevent us from getting into the spirit. It's also a 3D animated feature (a first for Spielberg) brought to life via performance capture, a process I persist in believing allows for imaginative visuals. The animation was made possible thanks to producer Peter Jackson and his special effects company, Weta Workshop.<br/><br/>It's adapted from a comic strip series that has been hugely popular in Europe since its inception in 1929. But it has remained largely unknown here in the United States, save for a small cult following. I confess, up until six months ago, I had never heard of the original comic or even of Belgian cartoonist Hergé, the series' creator. I couldn't help but wonder: Would that leave Americans ill prepared for this movie? If there's one thing I can't abide, it's a film adaptation that has only those intimately familiar with its source in mind. Gratuitous pandering to a fan base with no regard for general audiences is, as far as I'm concerned, an inflated form of elitism. What I'm thankful for is that ""The Adventures of Tintin"" has been made accessible to people like me, who have absolutely no baggage and are just looking to have a good time at the movies.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Tintin (Jamie Bell), a plucky, scoop-hungry boy journalist whose neat blue sweater and nicely combed red hair gives him a wholesome boy-next-door appearance. At his side is his faithful dog, Snowy, a white fox terrier. He immediately finds himself in hot water when he purchases a scale model of a three-mast sailing ship at an outdoor market; he's pursued by agents of the sinister Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (Daniel Craig), who has a model ship identical to Tintin's and is passionately in search of a third. The models themselves don't matter. What does matter is that vital bits of information have been hidden within each of them, information Sakharine is looking for. Eager to be on the case, Tintin does some research and discovers that the models represent the ""Unicorn,"" a seventeenth-century treasure ship that was attacked by pirates.<br/><br/>Tintin gets into even more trouble after being kidnapped by Sakharine's cronies. Now a hostage on a rusty steamboat, he joins forces with the ship's captain, Haddock (Andy Serkis), who's clueless, perpetually drunk, and maddeningly peculiar. How does he fit into Sakharine's scheme? Tintin knows that the key to unlocking this mystery lies buried within Haddock's mind, specifically in his memories – which have been repressed due to his years of drinking. In the meantime, a series of death-defying escapes leads them both to the fictional North African city of Bagghar, where the third model ship is located. Sakharine is, of course, hot on their trail, leading to yet another round of high-octane stunt sequences that are physically impossible but a great deal of fun to look at. I'll give Tintin this much: His life is anything but boring.<br/><br/>Films like ""The Adventures of Tintin"" make a compelling case for animation as the ideal medium for action extravaganzas – which are, by default, offshoots of the fantasy genre. When you're not bound by the limitations of reality, when entire worlds can be created with the click of a mouse and a few strokes of a keyboard, the possibilities are endless. Keep this in mind as you watch a spectacular chase sequence, during which Tintin and Haddock ride a motorcycle down narrow alleys, over rooptops, around tight corners, and eventually across a laundry line dangling above the streets. If the filmmakers have no need to fret over the laws of physics, then we have no need to question its plausibility. We can just let it happen.<br/><br/>The film is undoubtedly suitable for families, although the little ones are unlikely to make much of its quirky sense of humor, especially in relation to the character of Haddock. Adults and children alike may be a bit confused by a superfluous subplot involving a pickpocket (Toby Jones) and the detectives shadowing him, bumbling identical twins Thompson and Thomson. One is played by Simon Pegg while the other is played by Nick Frost, and honestly, I don't have a clue which is which. Since they look exactly the same, and since their names are differentiated by the placement of just one letter, I guess it makes no difference. All that really matters is creating an atmosphere of fun, which is exactly what Spielberg has done. Of all the animated films I've seen this year, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" is certainly one of the better ones.<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

","When Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson team up as director and producer, the outcome is easy to predict: they can't fail. They've unearthed the work of Belgian maestro Georges Prosper Remi, better known as Hergé, and have given it the American kiss of life. <br/><br/>The titular adventures are a dextrous amalgam of three Tintin stories: 'The Crab with the Golden Claws', Red Rackham's Treasure' and 'The Secret of the Unicorn'. As far as I can tell the three writers – Steven Moffat (of Dr Who fame), Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish – have remained faithful to the spirit of the comics and animated series. <br/><br/>The performance-capture technology used produces a veritable feast for the eyes. It is of such a high calibre that there is little room for improvement. The visual effects trounce those seen in 'Avatar' – and at a fraction of the cost ($130m is chicken feed nowadays). The great thing about the technology is how fluid the camera can be. We see angles and movements that no director, however skilled, can attain in real life. The long kinetic sequences are immeasurably impressive. <br/><br/>After buying a model of a ship bearing a unicorn, Tintin is immediately pursued by a nefarious man with the ironic name of Sakharine (Daniel Craig). Tintin slowly learns the reason for why he is being hounded and decides, in the interest of good journalism and adventure, to uncover the secret of the unicorn. <br/><br/>Into his quest he befriends Archibald Haddock, a gregarious sea captain who has a cruise ship of a nose and a weakness for whisky. Their perilous mission takes them across Europe via more modes of transport than you'll find in a Bond film. <br/><br/>The jokes are funny and varied. The persiflage between Haddock and Tintin is masterfully written. Andy Serkis, as Haddock, again brings a cartoon to life and it's about time the man was recognised for it. Jamie Bell, though not Spielberg's first choice, does well as Tintin. I've not heard him speak anything other than his Northern dialect before, but his refined English would stand up in any Received Pronunciation test. The famous bumbling police officers, Thomson and Thompson (identically sounding Simon Pegg and Nick Frost), are on hand to provide laughs and incompetence. <br/><br/>The film is atmospheric, which at times has a semblance of film noir. The only thing I recall about repeats of the Tintin cartoons from the '90s is that I couldn't follow them. That's not a problem here. If audiences don't assume the plot for themselves, characters reveal them for us. You just sit back and enjoy the ride. <br/><br/>I saw the film in 2-D because I am not convinced that 3-D is the way forward (see my review of 'Avatar'). Like all the kids I saw this with, I can't wait for the next one. <br/><br/>www.moseleyb13.com"

"pranaygmerchant","Null","1","4","20 November 2011"," Great Thundering Typhoons...its a Fast paced adventure....Spielberg doing what he does best!
","First of all the director (Spielberg) has done a tremendous job of making this an unforgettable adventure. Secondly the writers deserve a great round of applause for making the story so engrossing, fast paced and entertaining. A lot of liberties have been taken with the script (making it quite different from the original comic)to make it enjoyable. The atmosphere created and the overall look and feel is absolutely similar to that of the comic. It transported me back to my childhood days of reading the comic. The movie has some great edge of the seat moments with the right dose of action, adventure and humour. Spielberg surely knows how to concoct a successful entertainer which can be enjoyed the entire family.<br/><br/>The CGI and the camera work/the various angles shots is just tremendous. The cast is fabulous delivering great dialogues. A special mention to snowy the dog who creates lots of funny moments.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT: My only complaint with the film is that how does Capt. Haddock who has heard his Grandfather narrate the story of his ancestor visualize Sachrine to be Red Rackham's descendant since the story was narrated. <br/><br/>Well, nobody's perfect but this one surely comes close being one of the most entertaining films of 2011.<br/><br/>Cheers!"
"Kessler1996","7","1","4","20 November 2011"," A Treat For Those Who Grew Up With The Comics
","""I am entirely confident that I shan't see a better film this year."" That is what I said upon seeing J.J. Abrams' 'Super 8' earlier this year. Quite a claim, huh? But I have adequate justification for it: that was a film of genuine excitement, with such originality in its screenplay to give good, fun thrills, devoid of cheap gimmicky clichés, and an impressive debut for the child actors. It was a film I so thoroughly enjoyed that I went to see it twice! I have never, ever done that before with a movie so it was certainly a significant cinematic experience. It was so earth-shatteringly good that I labelled it the cinematic highlight of 2011, primarily due to its levels of excitement and enjoyment. I was so sure nothing would come close until last night. Sitting in my seat of the Apollo Theatre watching the latest offering from director Steven Spielberg, 'The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn', I wasn't so sure if my claim was all that accurate.<br/><br/>Adapting the 'Tintin' comics, the sensation created by Belgian artist Hergé, into a film was an excellent idea. The comics, so rich in witty humour, unique characters, and plot lines that unravelled themselves stylishly like movies of the film-noir genre, were universally popular with everyone! It all seems unaffected by age, even now. There is very rarely a dull line of events in these comics because they are almost always accompanied with either the foundations of a new sub-plot shadowed by the story's primary story, or a select snippet of physical humour or some witty line. These comics are a golden opportunity for international attraction; everyone knows of Tintin. <br/><br/>The premise of this film (based on the three Tintin adventures 'The Crab With The Golden Claws' (1941), 'The Secret Of The Unicorn' (1943) and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' (1944)) is simple enough: Tintin (played by Jamie Bell), walking around a crowded market, spots a beautiful model of a ship called ""The Unicorn"" and, admiring it, he buys it. An American (who later turns out to be an ill-fated FBI Agent), having failed to buy it off him, warns that he's entering a world of trouble with that ship, just as the film's villain, Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig; a very appropriate choice for his dastardly and malicious, yet very suave, tone of voice) wants the ship, too. Later, Tintin discovers a secretly-hidden scroll inside it and discovers that three identical ships each contain scrolls that unlock the secret of the treasure of Red Rackham. Kidnapped by Sakharine's men and bundled onto the Karaboudjan, he meets the ship's Captain, Archibald Haddock (voiced with a Scottish accent by Andy Serkis). <br/><br/>The essence of the characters seems to have remained generally intact in this film. Yet it was somewhat lacking the ordinary amount of foolishness from the bumbling-but-adequate Police Inspectors Thomson and Thompson (with the perfectly-chosen voices of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost to voice them). I can't argue that pursuing a master pick-pocket and smashing into a lamp-post is not what can be expected, but these two are known for their (eventually) efficient and cunning police work, underlined constantly with their iconic word rearrangements! They are forever correcting each other incorrectly (such as ""It's insanely perfect,"" one says, only to have to the other say, ""To be precise, it's perfectly insane""). That isn't truly shown in this film. But on the whole, it's all there: Haddock's light-weight alcoholism and characteristically elaborate insults still remain (such as, ""Miserable molecule of mildew!""), Tintin's thirst for adventure is forever unquenchable, Nester remains Haddock's extremely tolerant yet quietly patronising manservant in Marlinspike Hall, Thomson and Thompson still the clever twits of the story. Whether or not Tintin's constant narration of every thought that ran through his head was strictly necessary, or indeed accurate to the original character, is beyond me. It did wear a tad thin, I have to say! <br/><br/>Continuing the wonderful working relationship they've shared since 1974's 'The Sugarland Express', John Williams, who has written the music for all but two Spielberg-directed films ('Twilight Zone: The Movie' and 'The Colour Purple'), writes the music here. It is quite a strong element of the adventure, with Williams composing themes so distinguishable that you can guess what character is going to come up next. The Thom(p)sons have their own theme, Haddock has his own ""drinking theme"", arising whenever he craves some of his favourite 'Loch Lomond' whisky, and Tintin has his own ""mystery-solving/ thinking theme"". The body of the score is upbeat trumpets, superbly intricate riffs of the piano, and violin quivers in the more suspenseful moments. It's reflects the Tintin adventures to great approval. <br/><br/>I am so pleased to say that whatever childhood memories I had of the Tintin comics were presented rather loyally on this silver screen adaptation. Amongst all this, there is, however, a new memory I will be taking away with me: the CGI wizardry of the film. I found the concept of transferring one of history's greatest comic book characters to a computer-generated format peculiar, but I can say that it was the right decision. Not the most immediate idea, but one that works. <br/><br/>According to numerous Spielberg interviews I've read, every frame of the film took five hours to create using the CGI photorealism format. Again, minute features are accounted for: the fibres of a sailor's jacket, the scattered refractions of sunlight on a man's beard, the pores on Tintin's face – all there. As producer Peter Jackson put it, ""They look exactly like real people – but real Herge people!"" This film will doubtlessly be remembered as a digital-animation triumph of the decade, let alone just 2011.<br/><br/>'The Adventures Of Tintin: The Secret Of The Unicorn' is more than a kiddies' movie endorsed to make a shedload of money. It is so much more than that. It may well be the new 'Super 8'."

"SPaS","Null","1","4","13 November 2011"," ""That Spielberg guy can make pretty good movies""
","As quoted by my 8-year old son right after seeing this, Spielberg's latest movie. Well, ditto. The Adventures of Tintin: The secret of the unicorn is one damn fine adventure yarn and by far the most enjoyable entertainment movie from mr. Spielberg since the original Jurassic Park (-93). Technically it's nothing but well made but production values aside, this movie has a HEART. A honest, warm heart. Something Spielberg's offerings have been lacking for a long time. After Spielberg's ""serious season"" I found his ""War of the worlds"" to be cold and cynical. After the travesty of ""Indy 4"" I was afraid he's just lost his ""honest touch"" for good. For Tintin I had hopes, but dared not to expect much more than trivial entertainment with fancy graphics. Well, I'm happy to say I got more than I bargained for. Sure we got the best eye-popping technology money can buy, and a polished script, but above all, I say above all, this movie made me feel like a kid again. our basic movie night turned out to offer some great dad & son - time. Provided by Herge, Spielberg & Jackson. Thanks, guys, we'll be waiting for the sequel!<br/><br/>PS. I believe the prolonged 30-year wait helped the movie. First of all, there's technology: only this way the look is right. Peter Jackson was right to persuade Spielberg out of the live-action option. And before Avatar this look wouldn't have been possible. Second, the geeks. Now we got 30+yo fanboys, comic-cons and a ton of movies from comic books to prove that there's money to be made if you invest in a movie from a comic. And that you get better feedback the more loyal you stay to the source material. Third, I think a younger Spielberg would have been too cocky to do it right. Age and a couple of misfires (especially Indy 4) can teach you a few lessons about film - making."
"tomimt","7","1","4","13 November 2011"," Well I'll be damned, it's actually a good yarn
","I've never been the biggest fan of Tintin. For me his character has always been a bit too bland, while his adventures have been entertaining enough. But out of Franco-Belgian comics I've always preferred Lucky Luke and Asterix before Herge's comics. So with that I went to see Steven Spielberg's and Peter Jackson co production and Spielberg directed Tintin movie. And what a blast it was.<br/><br/>Firts of, as you might know, the movie is done with mo-capped CGI animation. Every previous endeavor at the field have been a mishmash of pretty pictures, but eerily human like and appalling characters. Not this time around. WETA uses all the tricks they've learned in doing movie effects like in Cameron's Avatar. They've pulled out all their cannons and they deliver a visual blast of unmatched animation and scenery. On a very few fleeing moments there's that feeling of unsettling eeriness present on a couple of minor characters, but I do dare to say that all the main characters and the majority of the side characters leave that feeling far behind and in many moments you just forget, that you are watching a CGI creations facial movements, as the emotion is fully present in every expression and the eyes steam of life.<br/><br/>The story of the movie revolves around captain Haddocks lost family fortune and villains, who are trying to take his rightful heritage away from him. Tintin stumbles upon this by an accident, when he purchases a miniature of a galley Unicorn. Sure enough, there are some holes in the plot, but Spielberg drives the plot forward with such an enthusiasm, that it is easy to forgive a hole or two, especially when we are treated with great deal of visually splendid action and humour. This all is lazed nicely with a soundtrack of John Williams. Over all the atmosphere is straight from old adventure movies, which dared to be fun instead of foreboding and gloomy.<br/><br/>Voice cast does a good overall work as well. Andy Serkis is good as Haddock and Pegg and Frost do a good job as Dupont & Dupond (or Thompson and Thomson, how ever you want it). Bell manages to breath some life in Tintin as well and over all he's a bit more rounded up as a character in the movie than he ever was in the comics. It's perhaps the facial expression, which are a bit more telling in the movie that they ever were in the Herge's images.<br/><br/>Also, what was a pleasant surprise, the character traits of Haddock have not been sacrificed in the altar PC culture, as he still is the same cursing drunkard as he is the books. Dupont and Dupond are the same incompetent detectives and Tintin is smart as ever while Milou, Tintins dog, stays as his loyal friend and edgier alter ego.<br/><br/>The 3D works nicely on the movie. It's not necessary for the movie, but it's not distracting either, it's merely there to give some depth to the picture so it's not necessarily worth the extra price.<br/><br/>All I can say is, that the more I think about it, the more I can recommend it."
"ssvikas","7","1","4","13 November 2011"," Very enjoyable; retains the charm from the original comics
","After being used to so many of sci-fi and hi-tech films seen in Hollywood, one has to admit that while watching this, there are many 'Why don't they use Google' moments. But it takes a lot to bring these comics to life while retaining the simple charm of those old comics that most of us would have read as kids. <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson have planned this as a trilogy and this is the first of the three and based on three original comic books: The Secret of the Unicorn (1943), The Crab with the Golden Claws (1941) and partly Red Rackham's Treasure (1944) and takes you on an adventure from the city to high seas to Saharan deserts.<br/><br/>Being a first, it establishes the characters: Tintin (Jamie Bell) as a journalist with a white fox terrier called snowy and how he meets booze loving Captain Haddock (Andy Serkins) as they attempt to thwart Ivan Sacharine's (Daniel Craig) evil plans. And, then there are the twin detectives Thomson and Thomson. <br/><br/>Comic timing by Captain Haddock is well done. The moment when he uses his alcohol breath to restart a plane is probably the funniest. And his lines 'billions of blue blistering barnacles' are sure to evoke your memories when you read those comics. It would be nice to see a return of these characters in the sequel and the other regulars such as Professor Calculus. Hope a sequel covers Tintin's Indian adventures too.<br/><br/>Many of the earlier versions of Tintin in motion picture or television shows haven't been impressive. Although I was skeptical about how this movie would turn out, Spielberg's genius makes it tick. Although the story deviates from the books at certain places, it doesn't affect the end product. There is a flow in the story, although it combines three books, there the thrill of non-stop adventure and a bit of drama. <br/><br/>The special effects are its high point. Filmed using motion-capture, i.e., translating actors' real movements in a studio to characters on screen, it seemed a good decision to retain it as a comic rather than enact it live retaining the charm that Herge's comics. Also, the creator believed that only Spielberg could do it that well. Nevertheless, considering that it was an animated film, the 3D could have been much better though. <br/><br/>While, I'm not sure whether those who have not been fans of the comics would really find the film interesting, it's still a worthwhile watch, irrespective of your age. This film works well for comic book enthusiasts and also for those with kids."
"Davidon80","9","1","4","13 November 2011"," Spielberg's best since Saving Private Ryan
","The movie opens with the classic 'Amblin Entertainment' logo, already the audience know they are in for something truly special. Then we have an opening title scene reminiscent of Henry Mancini meets Hitchcock in their hey day, oh how the cinematic juices are on overdrive. Then the story starts, bang wallop the pace is relentless, and the CGI just jaw dropping. In the first 20 mins I have my fingers crossed thinking don't stop, please, this is the most fun I've had in a cinema in a long time, please don't drop the ball, and the movies fast pace just keeps coming. Set piece after set piece, mcguffins, chase sequences, back stabbing, red herrings a plenty and jokes to boot. I haven't laughed this hearty in a cinema for a long time, and the jokes are spot on, not childish or aimed at the tween market but baldy, relevant and delivered with gusto.<br/><br/>The music sweeps me away, and as I'm watching all of cinemas finest moments come rushing back at me and I find myself comparing this movie with cinematic classics like Indiana Jones and Lawrence of Arabia mid movie. I fight the urge to make a conclusion just yet, knowing this movie is still not over and needs a final kick in order to make a final judgement call. I hold my breath as Tintin swerves and dives along sweeping me away into this scrumptious world and finally the movie closes. There's a climactic fight sequence at the end which I find a little out of place with the classier tone of the movie prior and I do wish there was time for a final hurrah something to take Tintin closer to a 10 rather than a 9, but it doesn't happen. The credits roll and the movie is over.<br/><br/>A part of me is sad that I didn't get that last cinematic slap in the face, but I'm satisfied. I think back to what other movie has taken me on such a journey and had made me smile and nothing comes to mind (not even Toy Story 3). I realise that for the duration of the movie I was a kid again, I had somehow gone back to my youth and was thrown back into Saturday mornings in front of the TV. holidays spent prowing the channels at mid day to find a movie treat, weekdays running home to catch the weekly cartoons. How long was I in that world for? 80 mins? maybe 90 mins? Tintin's run time is 104 mins, and none of it wasted.<br/><br/>Spielberg has returned to what he does best. For too long Spielberg has been preoccupied with being a different type of director, one that is more refined and tackling the political and the social, to the point where he was in danger of being forgotten Copolla or Lucas style into the great cannon of directors who were once great but now passed their prime. Tintin has him roaring back into the hearts and minds of the mainstream and will surely unleash a new franchise that will be eagerly anticipated in the years to come. Rumour has it Peter Jackson has secured the sequel, Guillermo DelToro is attached creatively. Spielberg has surrounded himself with the new crop of creative minds in the field and the results are sheer bliss for the cinema goer.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Andy Serkis for delivering some high quality voice acting, this guy just keeps morphing into new and wonderful things, literally. JOhn WIlliams score is pitch perfect and again is a return to form.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie, from Tintin to the hired thugs are fleshed out and full of life, props to all involved. Spielberg conducts these elements like a true maestro. Classic. One to be cherished for years to come and quite possibly in the top tier of Spielberg's work."

","No Spoilers - just the overview of the film. Whew! saw the 'Secret of the Unicorn' on the first day here in Malaysia. I had written on the release of the first poster last year , that this might be the end of how we had imagined the voice of Tintin and the swears of Haddock in our heads as Spielberg is going to replace it with his vision and imagination for us . But thankfully, he has managed to sync his vision quite well with what I had :) On the Movie - I Was blown away , it is one roller coaster which doesn't even allow you catch your breath right from the first scene. I agree with Spielberg when he says ""it is an unapologetic shameless adventure"". The Secret of the Unicorn was the first Tintin book that i read, back in 5th Standard and have been a big fan of Herge and a Tintinomaniac since then, so i can understand why some of the loyalists seem to be irked on seeing many elements of the original story changed and tweaked in this movie . But as far as I am concerned I think those tweaks only adds and not take anything away from the original unabashed romp and class of Herge. Only Spielberg could have managed such a feat! <br/><br/>The movie can never come close to the joy of the book but I don't think it is even meant to. On screen Spielberg and Jackson delivers something which is fantastically as close to what fans would remember of Tintin and also gives a whole new generation of people who haven't savored the magic of Tintin, a reason to dive into Herge's world. So all those who are cribbing, just sit back with a fresh mind and watch Spielberg transport you to your childhood. Cant wait for the second and third in the series! Hopefully it will be the Seven Crystal Balls/ Prisoners of the Sun followed by Destination Moon / Explorers of the Moon. Cheers"

","I have been a massive fan of the joys of Herge's ""Tintin"" for 32 years. I was eight years old when my brother handed me one of the books. Ever since then, I have been hooked.<br/><br/>When there was rumours about a film being made, I was very dubious. I felt like that right up to the moment of watching it last weekend. I had seen trailers of the film and I was very excited because it looked very good. I had been waiting for 4 years to see it, now I have.<br/><br/>I thought the whole film was fantastic. The characters were very true to the book. The comedy, the adventure and the scenery were absolutely stunning. The animation was first class.<br/><br/>There are two things I didn't like about it, though. One was there should have been more European scenes and the other is that the film had been changed a lot from the book.<br/><br/>I was disappointed, but the portrayal of the characters made up for it. Bianca Castifiore looked like so much like the character in the book. So did the others. Herge would have been pleased with the result."

The one who was just interested in bringing magic to the screen rather than Oscar baiting? He's back in what must be his most family orientated movie since Jurassic Park. Of late, the great director has added elements of darkness into his movies, but here is the film we wanted the Kingdom of The Crystal Skull to be.<br/><br/>From the very upstart, it's clear that the only way this movie could have been made was the CGI world we are given, because some of the stunning set pieces and 3D would never have made it into the movie.<br/><br/>The voice performances are flawless, and it's great to see Craig playing the villain with such a gleeful pantomime sneer, and not taking it seriously. And he has one of cinemas greatest robberies by using an opera singer to steal something.<br/><br/>The story is beautiful, and the score by Williams fives it that little bit more of a 'Raiders' feel to it.<br/><br/>It does start off very slow, but once we meet the wonderful Haddock, the film never lets up on the action until the very end. The chase from the Sultans palace for the scrolls has to be the action sequence of the year.<br/><br/>Seamlessly made in one exquisite shot, the 3D really brings the film to life, and their are some angles that could not have been made possible if it were live action.<br/><br/>And it's very humorous, the Thompson twins are more or less the comic relief, but there is a Lot of humour coming from the rest of the characters.<br/><br/>It all ends with the hint of a welcome sequel, and features one of the best references to jaws ever made.<br/><br/>Spielberg is back, making the sort of films that made him the biggest director of the eighties.<br/><br/>Magical stuff."

","The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn I am bedazzled! It was a ride alright. Even the Ferari roller coaster ride in Abu Dhabi wouldn't make me this dizzy. Yes...Tintin makes his arrival in a visual extravaganza.<br/><br/>Some say 'Looks can be deceiving'. And I say 'I have been deceived!' The visual detail is so engrossing that it gave me goosebumps every other second that the story got lost in the milieu. Then by the time I regained my consciousness I was in the middle of some desert being attacked by Pirates of the Caribbeaniesque(Part 3) hallucinations. Have I gone nuts! Apparently not.<br/><br/>Well this is what I have to say. The basic story of the movie is taken from three Tintin comics and it stays loyal (Edgar Wright was part of the Screenplay team \m/). The adventure is something along the lines of Indiana Jones with no Pit-Stops whatsoever. Jump-Run-Hit-Swim-Cut-Copy- Paste goes the format. Since Tintin is an iconic character, there is no much demand for showing the type of character he is. But present it to someone who doesn't have an inkling of who Tintin is...Alas, the characters come across as cardboard cut outs with a shady plot-line that is hard to keep up with. <br/><br/>Andy Serkis proves that he can act as a normal human being also and that too with absolute perfection. <br/><br/>All in all...it is visual romp with sprinkles of Tintin and Serkism added to it."

","I enjoyed every minute of The Adventures of Tin Tin. The story in not only fast moving, it's beautifully designed all the way through including the opening graphics. The carefully drawn Herge comic-strip style book has been translated into film perfectly. Tin Tin books, are not just fun to read, they are imaginatively adventurous and carefully designed and drawn. Translating all this so faithfully into CGi 3D and 2D film format is a brilliant achievement. I didn't want it to end. We watched it in 2D, as we all have slightly imperfect eyesight and find watching an entire feature film in 3D a bit uncomfortable. I suspect anyone with a lazy eye or astigmatism might have difficulty in really enjoying a film in 3D. I found myself smiling all the way through the film. Although it is an exciting adventure, it also has a really entertaining storyline. The pickpocket who catalogued and archived all the wallets he stole, Snowy's stunts when Tin Tin is kidnapped, the timing of the stunts, the bumbling Thomson twins and the brilliantly swashbuckling Captain Haddock. Probably, as with the books, this is a film I would want to watch again and again. The exciting and stylish world of Tin Tin offers such delightful escapism, I think I will want visit it again."
"moviexclusive","Null","1","4","2 November 2011"," A old-school action adventure in the vein of his earlier Indiana Jones movies, Steven Spielberg's 'Tintin' mixes action, humour and mystery into one thoroughly enjoyable ride
","Following the somewhat disappointing 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull', Steven Spielberg makes a rip-roaring comeback to action adventure territory with his 3D motion-capture adaptation of the legendary comic book series by Belgian artist Herge. The platform couldn't be more befitting- after all, Herge had thought Spielberg to be the only director capable of filming Tintin before his death in 1983. What however took Spielberg so long to realise his vision may not be immediately apparent, but once you see the jaw-dropping action on display, you'll realise that the wait was worth the while.<br/><br/>The first in a planned trilogy, the British screen writing trio of Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish have drawn largely from the comic 'The Secret of the Unicorn'- with bits from 'The Crab with the Golden Claws' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure' weaved in- to fashion an old-school romp that sees Tintin (Jamie Bell) setting off around the world to uncover some ancient treasure, while staying ahead of his Russian rival Sakharine (Daniel Craig). Except for some 17th century intrigue that explains the origin of the treasure, the straight-forward storytelling saves Spielberg from navigating potential narrative complexities to focus instead on the visual spectacle. <br/><br/>And what a spectacle it is, starting from the lovingly rendered photorealistic landscape of what may be 1930s Paris. The re-creation of this olden-day Paris is amazingly detailed- of cobbled streets, outdoor flea markets, men wearing bowler hats, well-coiffed ladies, and even the occasional pickpocket. Spielberg draws from old-school cinema's romanticisms of Paris, and thanks to modern-day CG wizardry from Peter Jackson's Weta Digital, the result is nothing less than an absolute gorgeous feast for the eyes. Younger auds may not appreciate these details, but those who grew up with the comic and the animated series will certainly relish the painstaking effort that has gone into each vivid frame.<br/><br/>Our advice is to enjoy these minutiae while you can, because once the whiz-bang action starts, you probably won't have the mental capacity to notice them. Unleashing his inner-child taste for adventure, Spielberg conjures up some of the most thrilling action sequences you'll see this year. The first major setpiece takes place against Tintin's daring escape from a steamer after being abducted by Sakharine. Together with a Captain Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis), whose ancestry can be traced back to the ancient fortune, Tintin pilots a seaplane right into an electric storm- and you can guess how exhilarating it gets when the Captain climbs out of the plane midflight to top up the tank located on the nose of the plane with his own whisky-infused breath.<br/><br/>But probably nothing can prepare you for the next elaborate sequence set in Morocco where the last and final clue to locate the treasure is hidden. In pursuit of the nefarious Sekharine, Tintin sets off on a bike chase through the narrow streets, with water with a broken dam gushing down the alleys and passageways. Most awe-inspiring is how Spielberg films the entire ten-minute sequence in just one single shot (the logistics of this alone worth checking out the extras once the DVD is released), and the relentless pace at which this unfolds will keep you on the edge of your seat to say the least. If the climactic sequence between two dock cranes controlled by Haddock and Sakharine comes off slightly less exciting, it is only because topping the earlier breathtaking setpiece would likely be quite an insurmountable feat, but not for a lack of the same visual bravado- the beautifully composed shots weaving in and out and between the cranes just as awesome.<br/><br/>These shots are testament to Spielberg's prowess as a visual storyteller, and besides the splendid action, other quieter moments also stand out- in particular, a scene where Haddock while walking through the scorching desert relays his family history that unfolds with a galleon emerging and disappearing from the sand dunes as if sailing up and down the crashing waves of the sea. It's hard to imagine how Spielberg would have been able to accomplish this live-action, and it becomes immediately clear why he had chosen to film this mo-cap style- despite the criticisms that have accompanied the format.<br/><br/>In the hands of such a great filmmaker however, the technology liberates rather than constraints- and thanks to the impressive work by the folks at Weta, gone too are the dead-eyes problem that plagued earlier efforts like 'The Polar Express' and 'A Christmas Carol'. Spielberg also gets a leg-up from the great character work of Jamie Bell, Daniel Craig and especially Andy Serkis- quite probably the king of performance-capture work following 'Lord of the Rings', 'King Kong' and this summer's 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. There is no doubt this is the best mo-cap work ever done, and a definitive giant leap forward for the medium.<br/><br/>Certainly, technology alone doesn't make a great film, but Spielberg has employed it in service of a rollicking old-school Indiana Jones-type action adventure with pulse-pounding action, some generous sprinkling of wit and humour (courtesy of the bumbling detective duo Thompson and Thompson played by hit comedian pair Nick Frost and Simon Pegg), and not forgetting a glorious score by John Williams that evokes both noir- mystery and a grand sense of adventure at the right moments. Indeed, Herge didn't get it wrong when he thought Spielberg capable of bringing the sleuthing boy reporter to the big screen- and with a stylish Saul Bass-type animated credit sequence and a nod to the original comic strip of Tintin right at the very beginning, Spielberg undoubtedly has his heart in the right place."

","'The Adventures of Tintin' is just the most stylish and visually stunning animation of 2011 – a beautiful effort and unique creation from director Steven Spielberg. It is a pity, however, that it didn't receive a nomination for Best Animated Feature because this film is far away better than the other animations that were nominated.<br/><br/>The scenarios were so creatively made – the backgrounds - that sometimes I thought that they were real scenes, not animated and like 'The Polar Express', this film captured real human movements to built the characters on the movie making them appear much more natural and their faces much more expressive.<br/><br/>The movie is based on three Tintin stories and for those who have already read them may notice some strangeness. Some radical changes were made – especially in the villain's character – and the situations presented in the tree stories were all mixed to make only one story that could fit in the film's necessities. That is the only thing I have to complain about – and I am not saying that the plot was bad, but just different from the original.<br/><br/>Overall, a good film that deserves high remarks on its visual production. Although it is an animation, it is a much more an adult film. There are some gun shots and deaths – nothing shocking, obviously – but uncommon in traditional animations aimed for kids. Also, the vast majority of the audience that was watching this film was adults – actually, I didn't see any kid watching it."
"aquarius012273-1","8","1","5","23 December 2011"," A Glad Venture with Tintin
","I had a certain amount of uncertainty, even trepidation, at first: would Spielberg do it justice? This is the movie adaptation of a much-beloved comic book series that we have grown up with. We are intensely familiar with the spread of delightful characters created by the Belgian comic book artist and writer, Georges Remi (or, more popularly, Hergé). The adventures were breathtaking in their imagination - oh, the places they went and people they met! - and the drawings had such motion, such flow - despite being bound in the two dimensions afforded by small box-panels - such cinematic quality, with long-shots, close-ups, masterful use of light and shadow. Would Spielberg (Director) and Peter Jackson (Producer) do it right?<br/><br/>There was also the question of the animation technique. I am not a fan of the motion-capture animation, having been sorely disappointed by the 2004 release, The Polar Express, which popularized this technique; the computer-aided process could successfully animate a vast range of motions of the characters except the eyes, giving the on-screen characters a rather zombie-like countenance with expressionless, dead eyes. <br/><br/>Well, I am happy to report that my trepidations were unfounded.<br/><br/>The animated credits at the inception were exquisitely done; visually pleasing, with intelligently placed graphics and moving images, and more than a passing nod to certain animated sequences made popular by the created-for-TV animated adaptations of the books, we thoroughly enjoyed it. The animation and effects in the main movie didn't disappoint either. Even with their animated feel, the characters came alive on screen; their interactions were fluid, with an unexpected élan. Depictions of nature and the action sequences were crafted adroitly and realistically; Hergé would have been proud.<br/><br/>So what about the main gripe against the movie that I have been hearing from my fellow Tintin-enthusiast friends? The story... as it almost always is. This is what the Tintin Purists found most offensive and whine-worthy. The writing team, which includes the British Writer Steven Moffat (of Doctor Who fame), did not stick to the original storyline and chronological sequence of events described for these characters. They took major elements, story and visual, from no less than three Tintin books, and resynthesized the narrative into a cohesive plot that moves at a fast and smooth pace.<br/><br/>Granted there were inaccuracies that jarred. The real story behind acquisition of the Marlinspike Hall, for example. Professor Calculus featured in the original storyline in a major way, but not in the movie; the meeting between Tintin and Captain Haddock also didn't quite occur as depicted in the movie; and the entire series of events surrounding the models of the 17th century ship Unicorn were imagined very differently by Hergé, from which the movie deviated significantly. The movie narrative, based primarily on The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure, nevertheless incorporated random plot lines snatched from many of the other adventures.<br/><br/>However, Tintin Purists (me included) need to understand one thing. Spielberg's Tintin movie of 2011 is being presented primarily to an audience that has largely no previous exposure to the comic book and its characters, unlike the audience in India or various European countries. The US movie-goers may or may not take to the franchise, at all; consequently, there may or may not be any sequels to this production. To account for this unfortunate element of unpredictability, the writing team must have had to incorporate as many plot elements as they could, in order to make a story that is enjoyable even to the uninitiated.<br/><br/>Well, it worked. It was a GREAT effort. I must admit, Bianca Castafiore was as delightful as I have always imagined her, even though in this movie, she didn't sing, ""My beauty past compare..."" What was also fabulous was the inclusion of Easter-egg like inside jokes that only the seasoned Tintin aficionados would get. Right from the first scene, there were displays, on the sly, of the comic-book characters that we so love. Certain elements of the desert scene were so reminiscent of The Crab with the Golden Claws, and a later scene at the dock allowed a surreptitious glimpse of the peculiar brand of cigar as in the Cigars of the Pharaoh. There were several others: Can you find them all?<br/><br/>Needless to say, I loved the movie, and hope Spielberg would not stop just with one. After all, material is plentiful in Hergé's long list of creations!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Not that I am hoping for marital strife, but I like it when Steven Spielberg wants to get out of the house. This year he has delivered awards contender ""War Horse"" and this crowd pleasing motion-capture animation film (also) for the whole family. If you are unfamiliar with Tintin, it is a long-running, extremely popular European comic series by Herge', who passed away in 1983.<br/><br/>Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) is an investigative newspaper reporter who looks 12, but clearly isn't. He lives on his own, travels the world and is treated like an adult by those with whom he crosses paths. There is an early scene where Tintin is sitting for a local artist and the resulting portrait is the exact simple look of the comic series. Tintin has a trusty sidekick ... his genius little dog, Snowy. Together they go on adventures that Indiana Jones can only dream about! This particular story focuses on the hunt for the lost Haddock family treasure. Tintin literally stumbles into the drunken sea Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) who is more concerned with his next swig of whiskey than the the fact that he has been kidnapped by the bad guy Rackham/Sakharine (Daniel Craig). This bad guy has unlocked the mystery location of all the clues to the lost treasure and needs Captain Haddock for the final step. Unfortunately for him, Tintin and Snowy get in the way and try their darndest to stop him.<br/><br/>The action sequences are amongst the most exciting and thrill-packed that you will ever see. They look like ""Jonny Quest"" on steroids. The story is quite convoluted and complicated and small kids will be totally lost on exactly WHY the characters do what they do. But it won't much matter, because the visuals of each scene are captivating. There are even a couple of Interpol agents on the trail ... Thompson and Thomson (voiced by Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, respectively).<br/><br/>Spielberg has always done nice work when he can go after a kid's imagination - even big kids like me. The look of this movie is pretty amazing, especially when compared to the 2004 ""The Polar Express"". If you doubt how far technology has come, look at these two side by side. Herge' creation is given script work here by Steven Moffatt, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. The great John Williams provides the score. This is one you can bring the kids to and all will enjoy."
"supremekingdan","9","1","5","10 December 2011"," Spielberg's apology for Kingdom of Crystal Skulls
","Tintin is one of my favourite cartoon characters. Hergé's 23 Tintin books all have charm, humour and excitement, and it really did seem like that charm only worked on the printed page. Why? Because pretty much any attempt at a film adaptation has ended in utter disaster. That is, until I found out Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson decided to have a go at it. When I found out they were making a film of my three personal favourite Tintin stories, I was more hyped that I was for the last Harry Potter movie. It's one of the best directors of all time, a great choice of producer, a talented bunch of writers including Doctor Who's Steven Moffat and Hot Fuzz's Edgar Wright, all working on a film of one of my favourite comic book series of all time. How could I not be hyped?<br/><br/>But I've got to admit, when I watched the trailer I was slightly let down. It looked like the film would revolve purely around epic action. There was nothing subtle about it, the film didn't look like it would have any of the light humour that the original series was known for. It almost looked like just a money-grubbing blockbuster, similar to the Lost in Space or G.I. Joe films. My expectations hadn't been completely let down; the trailer had good things in it and the poster looked cool, but it just looked like too much. I heard that this was all to ""spice it up a bit for the mainstream audience"", but this was pushing it.<br/><br/>So I went to watch it with my brother at my local cinema and we both just cleared our minds of expectations. I knew there was never a chance it'd be completely bad considering all the talent involved.<br/><br/>So the movie started. The first 20 minutes were... okay. Nothing awful, but I did feel it was more going through the motions of the book more than anything. The 2D title sequence was great and there was a clever little moment involving Tintin getting a caricature of himself done, with the result actually looking like one of Hergé's original Tintin drawings, but other than that nothing really stood out. It got things started and introduced all the characters I know and love, but I never really felt an air of tension and excitement.<br/><br/>Then, almost out of nowhere, things immediately picked up. I'll try not to give anything away, but it's got something to do with a ferry. From then on, the film really starts, and we are given a truly exciting adventure without a single second of boredom. The film plays out like Spielberg's Indiana Jones films. In fact, I'm willing to say that if you replaced Tintin with Indiana Jones, this would have been the real comeback people wanted. It's got that epic feel that I feared from the trailer, but somehow it manages to carry the charm of the original books all the way too. As it turned out it didn't really spice things up at all; the exciting atmosphere came purely from the original books.<br/><br/>The story is evenly paced and well put together. Fitting three comic books into a runtime of 100 minutes is no easy task, but the filmmakers do it beautifully, actually mixing the stories together to create one. The voice acting is also pretty good too. Andy Serkis was awesome and seeing Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as the series' comedic double act Thomson and Thompson was a pleasant and clever idea.<br/><br/>The animation is amazing. The mix of motion capture and fully computerised animation is used to its full advantage. Robert Zemeckis would be proud. The shot is also never still; the camera always seems to want to move. This can be a bit irritating at times, and a few of the shots are a bit exaggerated, but there are still great moments. In particular, there's an electrifying shot during a chase scene which you can see in the trailer. It's awesome.<br/><br/>Overall, Tintin is a great film which manages to capture that exciting Hollywood feel of Spielberg's Indiana Jones films, while also capturing the good humour and charm of Hergé's original stories. It's definitely worth a watch."
"Kalin-Thalis","8","1","5","7 December 2011"," Hergé said only Spielberg could do Tintin justice and he was right.
","As many reviewers here, I'm was a Tintin fan from a very young age. It was always a gift when I got a new graphic novel to read. As said in the title of this review, Hergé said that only Steven Spielberg could do Tintin justice in making a film and he was not mistaken. Spielberg honours the artist is such a magnificent manner, in the beginning of the movie which was a bliss!<br/><br/>The basic plot is to find the location of the Red Rackham's treasure. Tintin embarks on an adventure that takes him into a dangerous game in finding the scroll that will reveal its mystery. I don't want to spoilt too much of the plot, so I'm going to keep it very basic. In between I'll also explain where some changes were made and why this was, in my opinion, a necessary sacrifice. <br/><br/>The beginning of the first act is basically the same as in the plot. Tintin finds a replica of the Unicorn, which was a ship that held a magnificent cargo as he later discovers. Only minor changes were made such as the removal of Professor Calculus. All characters needed a proper introduction, because they are unknown to public, as graphic novel 'The Secret of the Unicorn' didn't introduce the characters at all. These characters also don''t know each other, which is why a scene such as Haddock meeting Tintin was inserted, so that they are properly introduced as in the graphic novels. So in case. You just knew them from previous albums. My guess is that Calculus will get a proper introduction in the sequel. Spielberg introduced this marvellous characters this in an inventive way, by firstly combining three graphic novels together. This isn't a full adaption of 'The Secret of the Unicorn'. Some wouldn't call this faithful to the graphic novel or to Hergé. And I can't completely disagree with them. But is that necessarily a bad thing?<br/><br/>A film is a different medium than a graphic novel so from when I heard the news that a film was going to made based on Tintin, I knew immediately that they were going to be changes. In my opinion the combination of three graphic novels was a good move, which allowed Spielberg to use the best work of Hergé, so I wouldn't call that unfaithful. And as long as it is faithful to his work than I am pleased. <br/><br/>The second act brings you to a very action-packed scene on a boat that takes them to Morocco. These scenes were based on the graphic novel of The Crab with the Golden Claws. It's in this act that we get introduced to Captain Haddock, which the villain Ivanovitch Sakharine First I have to tell you that Sakharine was no villain in the original graphic novel. But making him the villain was interesting to see, because it bound it to a new story to enjoy. Haddock slowly starts to remember the original story of his ancestor Sir Francis. In the graphic novel he find the story in his journal. In the film he slowly begins to remember it in a truly inventive way and in sequences, rather than just immediately. This made the film more funny and the visuals were spectacular. When we get to Morocco we see scenes of another graphic novel namely the King's sceptre. <br/><br/>A scene I really enjoyed is the chase scene. Most of the chase is, as if it was filmed in one very long shot, that doesn't cut. This made it like a roller-coaster ride, which was truly action packed and very enjoyable to watch. The climax of the film is not found in any of the graphic novels, mainly because Sakharine, as I said earlier, he was no villain at all in the original story. The ending is based on Red Rackhams' Treasure and this is where I got confused about the sequels. Because the ending implies that there will be no direct follow-up to the story and I hope that I'm wrong. <br/><br/>About the visuals and the 3D, I can only say that I wasn't disappointed. This was a big budget movie, so I didn't expect that Spielberg would use Hergé's actual style to make an animated feature like they already did in the past. I've already seen evidence of past live-action films and the attempt Spielberg made in some early tests that another live-action film would have looked quite silly. Motion capture was a very good choice, to stay faithful to Hergé's drawing style to some point and make this a very colourful and detailed spectacle. <br/><br/>As for the 3D, I can only say that it was very subtle. It didn't distract me in any way. Spielberg found a nice balance so that this film can be enjoyed in 2D as well in 3D. It won't let you down. And I'm not a big fan of 3D, but I did enjoy this. The style of the visuals combined with the setting really brought me back to the past setting seen in the graphic novels. And John Williams' music only improved this with his music, which never lets me down. The Soundtrack, in my honest opinion, isn't Williams' greatest work, but it is very good. <br/><br/>So was this a faithful film to Hergé's work? I would definitely say it was. But every Tintin fan will have a different opinion on this. There might have been changes in the scenes and of course the general story, but that doesn't make it less faithful to his actual work. And that is, what in the end, what matters."

Too many hands and the pencil snaps. But not before creating a tedious pattern of artwork; a maze to trap the first etching. The first etching burned in mind since I was eight was Tintin's coif. At 25, curling my thin gray hair at the cinemas I had expected Tintin to do the same or worse. After a low whimper I resigned to reality. Then I learnt to admire snowy's shining black nose and pristine white fur and look less at ""the forever 17's"" flaming hair and rosy cheeks and suffer in envy. This was until, envious I realized, the object of my envy suffered as well. At the screenwriter's hands and Spielberg's hands for tossing him into speeding traffic, swelling ocean waves, a glider ( he had learnt to fly by interviewing a pilot!), sand dunes, a mirage; the thick of the plot and the spray of alcoholic vapors in Haddock's breath. You couldn't have expected it to unfold any quicker. Schadenfreude is a sweet feeling! ""I don't remember anything about anything,"" replies Haddock when Tintin pesters him about his past. A few scenes later kids again explode into laughter and applause when they see Tintin riding through a clothesline with only the front tire and handles of a motorcycle and Haddock, the alcoholic brings a sputtering engine to life with his breath. I scratched the three elements it takes to make successful mass movies from my list- pop songwriting, over the top action, deus ex machina. If all this reading has made you dull and hungry then I will offer you the plot thick as soup. Tintin is at a fair where he spots a miniature of a ship called the Unicorn ( which also happens to be the title of the movie). This is no ordinary ship there are legends about it which only Tintin is aware of at the moment. He buys it. The diabolical Sakharine reaches the fair just then to get back the ship from Tintin. Tintin is intrigued. He puts on his detective coat and sets to investigate. He learns that the ship has information about the whereabouts of a treasure hidden by an ancestor of the Haddocks who wishes his treasure to be found only by one in his line of descendants. So how does Sakharine fit into the plot? Well not only is he after the treasure he seeks revenge. Sweet revenge! From whom? It couldn't have been more obvious. In an original piece of writing we see flashes of the past in the present and the future too in the present. What else could Tintin mean when he says there's another 300 kilos of gold buried in the Sea at the end of the movie. But with every bad movie as it is with the good there is always something to learn. Spielberg is an innovator. The characters have been animated so close to reality that you would forget you are watching a ""cartoon film."" I had actually much prefer to watch animated movies than model turned actors. With pirates of the Caribbean and the pirates there is such an excessive presence of pirates, treasures and monsters why can't a story of the ship and the sea be something different like Life of Pi or twenty thousand leagues under the Sea."

","I have loved the Tintin-albums ever since I was little. I remember going to the library, having a few on loan most of the time. They are great stories and also artistically great. There has been some controversy lately about supposedly racist content in the Tintin-albums, but honestly I don't think most people who read the albums see them that way. And also, you have to consider that these are very old cartoons written in another time. Anyway, it was with a mix of fear and anticipation that I went to see this movie.<br/><br/>I have to say the resulting movie has given me mixed feelings. It's a very divided experience with the first half feeling more like the albums. It's a puzzle mystery, the slapstick comedy of Thomson and Thompson and in general classic Tintin-fare. The second half contains a lot more action and feels like classic Spielberg-fare more than anything. I have nothing against Spielberg, but I'm not so sure that making Tintin into Indiana Jones is my preferred choice. Since I watched the movie in 3D (the only way to watch the movie with original language here) I found a little extra testing with the many fast and pretty roller-coaster-like action scenes.<br/><br/>Considering that the movie is based on more than one album (three if I remember correctly), it can be a bit strange for those of us who know the stories. But in the end I think that the writing was above expectation. Even though the focus on action sequences in the latter half of the movie was a bit overdone, I think that the movie is very watchable. Tintin looks a bit creepy at times with his pale and waxy complexion, but Haddock is very well done and transports the character from the albums superbly. Although I don't remember him as having such a big nose...<br/><br/>In the end I would have preferred a more toned-down movie with more emphasis on mystery and less on action. But I guess they have to sell their video games and appeal to kids with ADD as well. Considering that there will probably be a bunch of sequels I can always hope for a more subdued experience next time. I guess mostly I'm just happy they didn't ruin it.<br/><br/>I give it 7/10."

","In general, the production of ""Tintin"" alludes to one simple truth: Be in love the fact that he takes over. If you can not - do not pull at all. After these excellent titles appear character. Then, second, third, and others. And together with them in the viewer's head slips inevitable thought that he watches the story where it extends everywhere terribly pleasant, warm feeling of reverent attitude. Spielberg and Jackson seemed to hold in his hands a miniature teddy Tintin, and say, ""my darling you, you are very dear to me, and I will remove your story worthy material."" Absolutely healthy sentimentalism outstanding people.<br/><br/>Knowing, like any other spectator, Spielberg never imagined that he could be such a virtuoso. Prohibitive ease, despite the tremendous excess of saturation of the plot, and attention to all of its many parts in any of the episodes. As soon as the protagonist goes further and further into his investigation, Spielberg gradually more and more pressure on the gas pedal. One hundred and seven minutes to rapidly and consistently growing material, which completely faithful to the original source. Active adaptation to the original concept of the comic book is included in the first minutes, without showing any mercy to the audience confidently shooting his own power head.<br/><br/>Without even the slightest hint at a weak point. Uniform attention to all stages of production shows itself in all its glory, when the taste and color work appears in every way as devoid of attacks, as well as differences. No one pulls the blanket over himself.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis is high time to give that a Oscar, for such an outstanding job on their heroes in the mo-cap. Need more detail feel the subtleties of this technology in order to understand the extent to which the operator is masterpiece Janusz Kaminski as full a picture happy chaos, perhaps, even a child will notice. It's hard not to pay attention to scenes that are removed by a single plan, despite the fact that in one scene the hero of more than ten times the change in location of the local scale, and, incidentally, is not he alone. In other words, each more than five hundred times catch the question, ""well, that my friend, do not ever figure out how we managed to remove it?"" This is primarily Spielberg stormed the adult audience. The all-new level of animation, which is achieved by getting rid of the known problems of motion capture technology of the past. A release is going brilliantly and simply, Spielberg holds the highest bar for directing a massive amount of detail frame. It should be noted that in the past that no one has yet succeeded.<br/><br/>Not for nothing is actively publicized the names of the writers that are very well managed approach to adapting the source material. Originality extends to absolutely everything, every time changing its color, presented in the form of humor, in the form of interior parts, or separate dramatic characters, and so on. Perhaps somewhat lost because of his age cult composer John Williams. He manages to keep the bar full, but no more. If earlier it was possible to look over the projects he has worked to close my eyes and still feel full majesty only with your ears, here we can hardly see a similar picture. As a small minus someone may also take into account the lack of female characters, unless you count the fleeting appearance of a opera singer.<br/><br/>""The Adventures of Tintin: Secret of the Unicorn"" will amaze children of its history, and adults - an approach to it. An exciting and large-scale, original and fresh, colorful, funny and warm movie adventure, as a symbol of exquisite masterpiece of modern animation"

","Spielberg bought the rights of the adventures of Tintin, at least those starting with this episode when Captain Haddock comes into the picture. So we will have one film every Yule season, at least, if the actors survive the series or do not age too fast, though the digital processing of them enables them to age unseen in their digital skins.<br/><br/>The choice of technology and actors is perfect for those roles that are so well known that they do not admit any kind of mistake. The Dupont-ds are supposed to be perfect, and what's more perfectly dumb and inefficient, which they are. The very antagonistic representation of the Belgian policeman or inspector seen as Hercule Poirot for example. I must say the dog, Milou, is less convincing in that processing. He is processed slightly too much and smells as if he were just out of the dog's beauty parlor. The Castafiore is a marvelous superb operatic monster and she is truer than she could be in real reality.<br/><br/>The story is an old pirate story and Captain Haddock is an ignominious drunkard but he is fabulous in the desert and when he is reliving the adventures of his ancestor. At that level the film is quite a success for those who like pirate films and sea fights with sail ships, fire, canon powder, sabers and swords, etc. The falcon is also a good chap who fulfils his part quite well.<br/><br/>What Spielberg managed with great success is the great variety of landscapes, seascapes and other locations that is extremely important in this comic strip that leads the readers from the popular suburban areas of Brussels to the Sahara desert, the French foreign legion, the Atlantic by boat and the Atlantic by hydroplane, the unstable setting of a ship or a flying plane, as well as the disturbed stable setting of a city of a harbor. The duel with harbor cranes is quite a good idea indeed and spectacular.<br/><br/>Those of you who have known Tintin when you were the same age as the comic books will find it realistically done. Those who are from a younger generation will like the action and the special effects, and of course the chase for the treasure. You will only get the first leg of it right now, but next year, it is a promise, you get the second leg. After that If I believe the images of the opening credits you are going to get the moon, Tournesol and quite a few more of these adventures. I saw an allusion to Tibet too which is an earlier period, hence surprising. Have a good voyage in comic land.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","Strangely enough, this film is almost 2 months earlier here in Europe than its North American premier near the Christmas time(I watched it at 29th Oct with friends here), particularly this is a mammoth-budgeted blockbuster animation and not until I had finished it in the IMAX cinema, I become forthrightly certain that the sturdy word-of-mouth will allure even a larger audience into the theater during the Yuletide season and its US territory will be effortlessly seized like here in Europe. <br/><br/>In fact, Tintin is just one of the two enthusiastically-hyped films from director Spielberg this year, WAR HORSE (still under its veil) will rush into the Christmas field as well with some more potential Oscar buzz. Now it's rather too early to predict which one is better, but aiming different spectators, I optimistically expect it will be a win-win situation, and basely according to my enraptured experience with Tintin, Spielberg is back at his top form after the universally- disappointing INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL in 2008. <br/><br/>From the technique angle, this cutting edge performance-capture animation has surpassed any precedents which endeavor to blur the boundary between animated feature and real-person features. After the tepid responses from a clumsy pioneer FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRIT WITHIN (2001), Robert Zemeckis' misfired THE POLAR EXPRESS (2004) and BEOWULF (2007), Tintin is truly an innovative triumph, all the subtlety and details are represented immaculately with accuracy and verisimilitude. Thanks to this state-of-the-art cutting-edge advancement, seamlessly matches with the Indiana Jones-que adventure structure, being a non-fan of the original cartoon books, I was stupefied to witness the smoothly fabricated world, everything is miraculously tangible (my favorite part is with Bianca Castafiore and the subsequent eagle- chasing bravura) and the narrative doesn't lose its fuel until the very end, which leaves its audience no time for any distraction (as a matter of fact, it is indeed the story of Captain Haddock, Tintin is demoted as a sidekick during the latter part). <br/><br/>We all know film is a world of imagination and somehow this film is foreboding that here comes the arch enemy of actors, high-tech could be the kryptonite of this glamorous yet sumptuous occupation, which had been proposed before when the ill-fated FINAL FANTASY first came into being! By the way, I cannot figure out Daniel Craig and Andy Sekis' voices in the film, I was pretty sure Craig could not be the villain, and it turned out to be my mistake! <br/><br/>This is no question this is one of the best animation in this century, if the academy acknowledge its admission (accidentally news came out today Tintin is officially on the shortlist of BEST ANIMATED FEATURE category of next years' Oscar race), it will without any doubt be the definite front-runner!"
"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","5","1 November 2011"," Dazzling visuals, strong score and great cast, could've been even better
","I was much anticipating The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. It looked interesting, the cast on paper are great and I am fond of both John Williams and Steven Spielberg. I am also a fan of the comics and the animated series which I saw over and over in English and French.<br/><br/>When I finally saw the film, I admit I was slightly disappointed but actually while there was room for improvement I thought it was good.<br/><br/>First of all, the visuals are truly dazzling, so much colour and you can tell in both the settings, character designs and cinematography that a lot of effort had gone into it technically. John Williams' score is not among his very best, but it is strong and memorable with some of Williams' distinctive style.<br/><br/>The story is a great idea and while there are some slow spots it is thrillingly told. There are also some masterly touches to Spielberg's direction, particularly the back of a hand morphing into desert dunes, the galleons on the ocean enacting a sea battle and a motorcycle chase taken on one shot.<br/><br/>Against all this, part of me felt it could've been more. For me, despite the brilliant voice over from Jamie Bell, not much is done to make Tintin particularly compelling. The script is mostly good, but the comedy could've been timed a little better. This has nothing to knock Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, their delivery is as enthusiastic and as witty as it ever could be, but sometimes the presence of Thomson and Thompson jars with the overall tone of the film.<br/><br/>I loved the cast. Bell is brilliant, Pegg and Frost are good as are Daniel Craig and Toby Jones but I thought the standout was Andy Serkis. Not only is he a lot of fun to watch and hear, but for my money Captain Haddock and Snowy were the two most engaging characters.<br/><br/>All in all, a good film with several strong things, but I wasn't entirely blown away by it. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","Warning - some light spoils - As an early reader, in my young age, of the whole collection ""The Adventures of Tintin"", I took great interest in Peter Jackson & Steven Spielberg's handing on this monument of European & world culture.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the graphics deliver here some tremendous effort, the kind of which everybody could bow to...<br/><br/>... But, but, but.<br/><br/>Tintin was not, and was never to be a real young man that Hergé could meet in a Brussels square and take as a subject for a portrait. Tintin WAS Hergé, an idealized expansion of his will to meet the world and solve any of the problems he meets there, so little or so huge they could be.<br/><br/>That's the only way Tintin is : solving, solving, solving everything everywhere to save the day, his life or the world occasionally. Never has he be an antiques seeker with a whip in his hand or in his head. And he just was here BEFORE Indiana Roller-coaster Jones. Here, in Europe, the real Europe, or elsewhere in the world, the real world, the world before, during and after WWII.<br/><br/>What is really fascinating about the whole serial albums of Tintin, is the way it deals with great international affairs of its time : as close as possible with the Great Story, as clear as possible to be understood by young readers, and as subtle as possible not to hurt, not to expose them.<br/><br/>It began in 1930 with Russian soviet-ism, then animal hunt and colonialism in Africa in 1931, then US gangsterism in 1932, then Egyptology and opium traffic in British colonies of Near East 1933-34, then Chinese-Japanese relations in 1936, then the Chaco War in south America in 1937, then counterfeit money in Scotland in 1938, then political plot in central Europe in 1940, then opium traffic again between western Europe and Morocco in 1941, then a competition between scientific teams seeking for a mysterious island where... giant mushrooms grew in 1942, then a domestic affair involving antique dealers stealing antiques in 1943, then a submarine tool to seek a sunken boat in 1944, then a mysterious curse driving scientists into a mad suffering illness in 1948, then a solitary expedition in the mountains to try and cure the curse in 1949, then some oil war in Arabia, then a secret scientific missile project sent to the moon in 1953-54, then the search of a sonic weapon of mass destruction in eastern Europe in 1956, then some slave traffic in Indian ocean in 1958, then the loss of a Chinese friend in Tibet/China in 1960, then a very tiny domestic mystery in 1963, then some air hijacking in the Pacific Ocean in 1968, then some revolutionary war in South America in 1976, then some traffic about modern art in 1986, alas unachieved.<br/><br/>All of these where carrying subtle connections with the harsh world and the pleasure is to find them, and remember them.<br/><br/>Does it allow to be puzzled all the way ? I don't think so and it certainly happened.<br/><br/>For example, the villain in ""Le Crabe aux Pinces d'Or"" (The Crab with Golden Claws) was lieutenant Allan Thompson, dealing with opium traffic in the Cargo Karaboudjan, but that we hardly see in Spielberg's film ; Allan Thompson was obviously an American trafficker. So, guess, why did Anglo-Saxon translators of Tintin call the Dupondt policemen 'Thompson', and hide Allan, without even mentioning his name, behind some guy named Ivanovitch Sakharine ? hmm ? So with the villains in the Album ""Le Secret de la Licorne"". They where the Loiseau Brothers, stealing antiques, detaining and chasing Tintin in a castle they were being occupying for two years, as were the Nazi Germans occupying castles all around Europe and... stealing art everywhere, kidnapping and detaining people to ask them informations. Loiseau means ""The Bird"", as the German emblem was an eagle. But we don't see the Loiseau Brothers at all (except on a tiny picture in the market place) in Spielberg's movie.<br/><br/>So, apart from breathtakingness, can we say this is faithfulness ? No we surely can't. Not only something is gone, but something of the real Tintin is kinda kidnapped.<br/><br/>But Tintin, as we know him, has always been able to escape from kidnappers."

","When I was a teenager, my favourite comic books were ""Asterix"" and ""The Adventures of Tintin"" by Herge. You can guess my excitement and anticipation when I learnt that titans Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson were collaborating to bring Tintin to life on the big screen. However, when I saw the trailers for ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of The Unicorn"", I was a bit apprehensive.<br/><br/>Will they capture the spirit of discovery and adventure of the young Belgian reporter? Can they flesh out the many wonderful characters of the comic books? The trailers weren't that impressive. Well, just after 10 minutes into the media screening last Friday, my fears were dashed - and I was transported back to my childhood again! The movie contains elements from three of Tintin's adventures: ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" (published in 1945), with some parts of ""The Crab With the Golden Claws"" (1943), and a bit from ""Red Rackham's Treasure"" (also 1945). It opens with Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell) buying a model of an old ship called the Unicorn at an outdoor market in an unnamed European city. As soon as he pays for it, two other guys come along to try and buy the ship too! They are a sinister-looking Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and an American named Barnaby (Joe Starr).<br/><br/>Expectedly, Tintin refuses to sell, and he soon discovers that the model ship contains vital clues to hidden treasure involving a Capt. Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis). The ensuing adventure takes Tintin, Haddock and the boy's faithful dog Snowy over the seas to the Sahara and a fictional Moroccan city of Bagghar in search of hidden treasure.<br/><br/>For me, the most important part of the movie is its richly detailed retro charm that coloured Herge's comic strips of the early 20th Century (especially the pre-war years). Tintin and Snowy are rendered in the performance-capture shots exactly as they were in the comics and the ageless boy reporter seems to be a tad more mischievous than his comic book persona. Serkis' alcohol-loving Haddock looks so realistic that we mistake him for a live character.<br/><br/>Enhanced by 3D, CGI animation affords all sorts of 'impossible' action and stunts and Spielberg exploits this to the full with almost non-stop chases and spectacles. Tintin's chase of a thieving bird through the streets and rooftops of Bagghar is one of the most exhilarating chases I have come across in the cinema. Herge's brand of humour is reflected in the comic relief provided by Nick Frost and Simon Pegg as Interpol officers Thomson and Thompson, respectively. The gags are all very PG-type comic relief, and not hilariously funny.<br/><br/>Some Herge purists may argue that the movie lacks resonance and an emotional connection to its protagonist. That may be true but personally, I don't remember having much emotional connection to Tintin when I read the comic books. He was a young hero with whom I identified, that's all. Also, watch out for Spielberg's tribute to Herge in the opening scene at the open market. The legendary Belgian author is shown as a street artist who does a sketch of Tintin, looking like one of the original strips. Good for you, Spielberg. (Full review at limchangmoh.blogspot.com)"

Thereupon begin the adventures (and misadventures) of Tintin and his adorable and sharp-as-a-tack companion Snowy, as they set upon investigating the cause of the robbery. <br/><br/>It is a gripping journey of a treasure hunt that begins in Brussels and swiftly traverses the waters of the Atlantic, taking us to the enchanting Kingdom of Morocco.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis (Gollum of The Lord of the Rings), who doubles as the drunken but proud Capt. Haddock and his courageous grandfather Sir Francis Haddock intoxicates us with both roles as he unveils the mysteries of The Unicorn.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig is remarkable as Sakharine and his ascendant, the rapacious pirate Red Rackham. <br/><br/>Inspectors Thompson & Thomson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) bring some chuckles with their outrageous stupidity!<br/><br/>Weta Digital has presented brilliant visual effects authenticated by veteran John Williams' composition (elevated to a high by the magical utterance of the Blistering Barnacles & Ten Thousand Thundering Typhoons!)

","You don't have to be a die-hard freaky fan of Tintin like me to keep this movie in your wish list. Though, it does help :). So after years of waiting, I finally get to see it before it's release in India. SS & PJ take you on a roller-coaster ride that makes you want for more. First of all, kudos to the duo in selecting the best story to start the Adventure of Tintin Series (technically its not the first, been attempted earlier in human cast and in animation, but you haven't missed much if you don't know about it). Among the many master pieces of Herge, The Secret of the Unicorn + Red Rackham's Treasure, The Seven Crystal Balls + Prisoners of Inca, The Cigars of the Pharaoh + the Blue Lotus, are actually the best Sequel stories. By making the right choice, the pace of the adventure is well set.<br/><br/>In fact, the Tintin theme, with which the movie starts is a well crafted intro which gives the fans of these books a great view of all the well know adventures. Then comes the master stroke, which even Herge would agree has given this movie a brilliant twist. SS & PJ actually mix & mash stories from the Crab with Golden Claws (the book in which Captain Haddock makes his debut) & the Secret of the Unicorn to make a new masala spice. By doing this, they have made sure that the true fans, who otherwise know the story at the back of their palm are also kept engrossed. And then they have added some new story line and sub plots which even Herge had not thought of. So new or old fans, are treated democratically.<br/><br/>The comic books till now lacked voice, music & the specific action like the gait & the walk for each character. The duo has managed to score well in all these departments. Thus giving life to ones childhood fantasy. So there's every know element, from Great Snakes to Blistering Barnacles, from the naughty Snowy to the stupid Thom(p)sons, from well mannered Nestor to the ear deafening Bianca Castafiore, from the rogue mate Alan to the guy who taught me the meaning of Kleptomaniac as a kid. But where they win your heart is with the real life feel animation and the brilliant merging of scenes. Look out for the Saharan desert turning into the sea and the Captain's description of the fight with the Pirates. Its like the comic book images being flickered in front of you and you cant stop drooling.<br/><br/>By the end of it you would want to live longer just to see the next installment in which Cuthbert Calculus, the absent minded cum hearing impaired professor, makes his debut. But for now go for this adventure armed with your 3D gear with or without popcorn. Ten stars from me."

","Lets start with the bad parts....<br/><br/>Straight off - let me say that the rating of ""U"" is wrong. It should be ""PG"" at least. Example; A man is shot dead in the doorway of Tintin's apartment and there is blood all over a newspaper. Call me old-fashioned - but this is most definitely not what I want my 8 year old to see. He didn't particularly want to see it either. There are a lot of machine guns, shooting and male posturing. There is not one female character, not a single one, that could have softened this film.<br/><br/>I was disappointed too, with the portrayal of Captain Haddock - who is shown as a shocking messed up old drunkard. I grew up in the 1960's with the cartoon version of this and the books and I don't remember him having such an issue with drink. In the film Haddocks' drink problem is shown more than it needs to be, and it crosses over the boundary into the glorification and humourisation of alcohol. Having lost a brother to drink I didn't find it humorous in the least, and as such I didn't want my son to see it either.<br/><br/>So,why the 7/10 rating? Well - it looks GREAT! Really clever innovative imagery. Worth seeing just for that alone. The story is pretty good and age appropriate for children. The action is fairly relentless and the film captures a lot of what was good about the original French books and cartoons. Every good story covers a lot of ground and ""Adventures of Tintin"" certainly does that. There is a lot of the Indiana Jones movies reprised in this film, and I liked it for that too.<br/><br/>Overall - this is typical Spielberg, actually - not particularly good Spielberg. It doesn't need the alcohol and the shooting, it did need a female character of some sort. It's OK OK, well...Mmmm, but don't take children under the age of 10 to see it."

","From a fan of the Tintin comics, this film is mediocre. Herge was an amazing story teller, but this film strayed so far from the original comics that it's not worth the time. <br/><br/>Captain Haddock wasn't funny in this movie, which was the element that made the books great. This animated version Haddock was just irritating to watch.<br/><br/>Tintin was portrayed so flatly, that I didn't feel any attachment to the character.<br/><br/>The entire film felt rushed and pieced together randomly, not fully developing any elements.<br/><br/>Please do yourself a favour and go read the original comics."
"MihaiSorinToma","5","0","1","16 August 2017"," A superbly animated failure
","This is the story of a well known boy, Tintin, who works on an article regarding a model war ship and its history which ultimately gets him into a lot of trouble. While the ship itself is rather insignificant, it contains a secret message that leads to a priceless treasure which lays at the bottom of the sea. Together with a famous but drunk Captain, he must solve the mystery and find the missing treasure before the bad guys get to it first.<br/><br/>It's a cliché story, featuring a bunch of stupid, idiotic and mentally retarded characters who generally try to reach their goal, if they remember which that is of course. It's as linear and as predictable as it gets, nothing and nobody from it managing to stand out of the misery. This movie has one upside, a very big one. It is absolutely superb animated, in a lot of scenes being difficult to tell the difference between it and reality.<br/><br/>Despite this major advantage, they decided to rule out most laws of physics, a lot of mind boggling events almost shatter your intelligence. I understand that it is, despite all, an animation which isn't supposed to be realistic, but when you do everything you can to draw it as realistic as possible and tell a plausible and apparently serious story, you cannot insult the general public like that. I mean, how can you tell me that a drunk person can burp inside an empty airplane tank and give it enough fuel to continue almost as nothing happened and even after the same plane crashes into the desert, it continues to spin it's propeller although buried into the sand...It leaves you speechless. The finale is as stupid as the rest of the movie, leaving room for an upcoming sequel, unfortunately.<br/><br/>To sum it up, a stupid movie in every single way which receives five stars from me only because of its gorgeous appearance and nothing else. A huge disappointment!"

","This digital animated film recreates one of the most famous stories of the comic Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. Directed by Steven Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson, with soundtrack of John Williams and a script by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, the film features the voices of Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, and other voice actors.<br/><br/>I was never an avid reader of Tintin, but the comic strip was, for me, a good company during childhood and adolescence (still is, sometimes). But I never had a good impression of films based on comic-strips, as always end too stylized or unrealistic. In this case, keeping the film as an animation, I was waiting for something like the comic, and many similarities with the magazine. But my expectations were far from being met by this film, which does not seem able to capture the essence of Tintin. The script, despite being good and consistent to the cinema, don't link to the comic where it was based. On the contrary, it almost rejects it by mixing elements of another magazine and invent many other things that don't fit in the Tintin image, issued by magazines. Therefore, characters seem rather forced, and their reactions don't seem true to what might be expected in the magazines.<br/><br/>The dubbing work looks very good, I didn't notice delays or errors. Most of voice actors used here are seasoned actors, with an excellent voice modulation capability, knowing well how to put voice to achieve the desired effect. The work of animation and visual effects are excellent, very colorful and striking. Its the wonder of digital animation. The soundtrack is very good but I expected something more intense.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is quite interesting and entertaining but becomes boring at certain times and almost can't create a real sense of mystery, suspense and adventure."

","I am not a fan of Tintin, and I wish this movie was made using different characters.<br/><br/>The action in this film is very similar to a 007 movie. Only, it has even more action, more stunts, more dynamics, and better settings. The action scenes are even more exaggerated than in a Bond movie which can be a little annoying at times.<br/><br/>What is an achievement is the unique graphics. This looks like a landmark because the color rendition and the dynamic of the movements are not only realistic, but have a degree of representation that makes the whole picture look like truly enjoyable. It doesn't look like real life and it doesn't look like animation either. Rather, it looks like something in between, something new that finally makes an animation pleasant to watch, as opposed to all other animation movies to this day.<br/><br/>The only downside - and a surprising one for a Spielberg movie - is the soundtrack. It just lets down the movie.<br/><br/>On the other side, the action is brilliant, even by Spielberg standards. It simply doesn't stop without being overwhelming. The sets are beautiful and catchy.<br/><br/>I hope there will be other animation movies using this animation technique.<br/><br/>And while there, it will be nice to see Spielberg directing a James Bond movie"

","I must admit I'd never heard of Tintin, probably too old? But I caught this film on television and loved the look of it! For the first couple of minutes I even thought it was live actors, it looked so life like, even though some of the characters looked a bit caricaturist? It had a great look all the way through it, and I couldn't help but wonder that with this sort of technology, how long before they can bring some of the old legendary stars back to 'life'? Imagine new films starring the likes of Clark Gable, Bing Crosby, Errol Flynn, Cary Grant and so forth? Mindboggling for sure, but it seems the technology is almost at that point! I imagine the thing probably preventing someone trying is the legalities of it all? But, after seeing this film, it's fascinating to dream about what could be just around the corner?

","So they changed the dog's name to ""Snowy"" because the French name doesn't translate! Spielberg and Jackson are releasing a new ""TinTin"" in 2016 and I look forward to it. The animation backgrounds alone rival the best action scenes from any live-action film. The story is a bit repetitive, but the action never stops. It's a great family film for all but very small children and exceeds ""Polar Express"" which is a statement I thought I would never make. There is a lot of Spielberg influence and it will somewhat remind you of an Indiana Jones adventure. ""TinTin"" is a young French reporter, with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and adventure. Of course in this version, he speaks English. Tons of impossible stunts and explosions that work better when animated. So realistic except for the intentional ""comic book"" look to some of the characters (The Scotland Yard Detectives and Capt. Haddock have huge noses) that you forget it's animated. The dog is amazing and had to be ""dropped in"" fully animated next to the motion capture footage. This is ""Premium Pixar"" style computer animation, created by Peter Jackson's WETA Studios in Australia. Basically a classic globe-trotting ""chase movie"" kept almost bloodless because it is fully animated. So clean it's barely even ""PG"". However, the Capt. does have a drinking problem and it's a bit violent at times. Lots of broken glass from shattered rum bottles hitting people and huge sprays of bullets that tend to miss their mark. Very few ""bad words"" if any. Many plot twists that keep you guessing until almost the very end. Argh! It's all about buried treasure and family honor! If you like Disney's ""Pirates"" series you will like this as well, even though it is not live-action!"

","There's something odd about the name Tintin. It just doesn't sound complete, does it? No first name, just Tintin. I'm not familiar with the Belgian comic book character on which this film is based, so I'll just have to go with my impressions of the story as I viewed it with no preconceptions.<br/><br/>What you have here for all intents and purposes is an Indiana Jones type adventure with some innovative twists written into the story. With it's emphasis on a fabled Man O' War sailing ship, The Unicorn, there's also a bit of a 'Pirates of the Caribbean' flavor to it as well. The hero Tintin seemed to be a young boy to me, so when I saw him mixing it up with Sakharine's henchmen I had to wonder about that a bit. Apparently the character is a newspaper reporter, so he can't be a kid, but that's still the impression I had throughout most of the story.<br/><br/>The thing about the film's style of CGI had me consider something I hadn't thought of before. You can do a whole lot more with this type of picture than with live action as you're trying to simulate various action aspects of the story. For example, in the chase through Bagghar, it would be impossible to have a falling building tilt over on it's side (or would it?). I guess anything's possible today with the technology that's available, but this style seems to stretch those boundaries. Another thought, it would be absolutely criminal to wreck a whole bunch of classic 1930's autos like they did here, so once again, the possibilities are unlimited without actually destroying stuff. So that seems like a plus.<br/><br/>Overall, I rather enjoyed the picture. Very colorful with a good rapport for family style entertainment. It had interesting characters and a fair amount of humor, and even a worthy canine companion for the hero. It doesn't make me want to run out and look up the stories that the script was based on, but that's not necessarily a negative. Reading some of the other reviews of the picture I see fans of the writer Herge coming down on both sides, both positive and negative. For once I'm not in that bind, and simply enjoyed the film for the entertainment it offered."
"per-181","8","0","1","31 July 2012"," Visually amazing, otherwise OK
","Being a long-time Tintin fan, I had pretty low expectations when I bought this movie – but of course I had to see it. For the first time ever, motion capture and animation work perfectly – the realism is fantastic, down to the tiniest hair. Sometimes you could swear it is live action on film, though it isn't. The animated Milou (I refuse to call him Snowy, what a silly name!) is the best I've seen in that genre; totally believable.<br/><br/>The story is OK, a mix of different Tintin plot lines, nothing to complain about. But the dialogue and the voice casting, oh my! Haddock should have been a much more growling, non-Scottish, powerful character – and he swears ten times as often and fifty times more creatively in the comic albums. The Thompson cops aren't nearly enough stupid sounding (thanks to the very overrated Pegg/Frost duo), Castafiore should have been hitting false notes all over the place, and so on. And why is Tintin ginger? He's as blond as blond can get.<br/><br/>But these are minor quibbles. All in all, extremely entertaining – and I'm looking forward to the sequels."
"Kakueke","8","0","1","20 April 2012"," Did Spielberg Succeed?
","In recreating Tintin novels for a movie, Spielberg faced a difficult challenge. Did he succeed? <br/><br/>I think Spielberg made a good try, particularly in the early scenes. The depiction of the story locations the Old Street Market, 26 Labrador Road, Marlinspike Hall, and aboard the ""Karaboudjan"" ship made me feel I was in a Tintin book in a fair attempt. Snowy's chase of the cat was right on point with one and more actual occurrences in Herge's books.<br/><br/>But recreating Tintin in another medium for more than 100 minutes is a big task. As one other commentator on this board put it, the panels in the Tintin books are uniquely stylized, and this raises two questions. First, can they be recreated on screen, and second, if not, can Spielberg do anything that in its own way equals Herge's stylization -- artwork, dialogue, atmosphere, action, progression -- in terms of magnitude of achievement?<br/><br/>My answer in both cases is no. Except for the first three not-fully-developed (and sometimes silly) Tintin books and the last, with its mediocre story, to me, there is nothing like Herge's accomplishments with Tintin. It is hard to think of anything that will grip a reader more. Tintin books are so fully absorbing, unique, and compelling in storyline, atmosphere, and drawing detail that I do not think they can ever be matched on film, by Spielberg or anyone else. Even if Spielberg literally copied the dialogue, art, and panels, something would be lost with the film continuum as opposed to separate panels in the books. But no one is going to do that anyway, which leaves me to declare only that no one who makes a Tintin film with his own touches is ever going to match Herge. This is different from, say, taking something that was based only on written prose such as The Godfather, the story of Gordon of Khartoum, and the Seven Pillars of Wisdom and putting it on the big screen (incidentally, ""Lawrence of Arabia"" will always be No. #1 with me on visuals). Yes, you can outdo prose and some drawing in terms of dramatic impact and entertainment (although some will subjectively say, a written format was still better for them).<br/><br/>Having said that, I have a positive comment on the visuals. I went into this movie expecting overfast, confusing, and bloated action scenes because that is the trend of today. It is true of standard movies with regular people, so with a 3-D, motion-capture, computer-animated adventure movie, I certainly expected even more, as the norm. I am happy to say, I did not find anything overdone until the falcon chase scene and the final conflict, starting around 1:20. Otherwise, I found enough breathing room and thought the action scenes were fitting when measured against the action-packed Tintin books themselves. Starting at the very beginning with ""Tintin in the Land of the Soviets,"" we know that the series will have a lot of wild rides, escapes, and chases on land, sea, air, and under water, even in outer space, as well as frequent fighting and combat, plus slapstick. <br/><br/>The portrayal of the characters themselves I consider separately. Herge's Tintin was incorruptible and had character, poise, and heroic qualities. However, it is not an original comment to say he did not have much personality, as compared with, say, his basically equal co-hero Captain Haddock, Professor Calculus, Bianca Castafiore, and others. But should we demand Spielberg deviate from this and give him more personality? <br/><br/>I suggest yes, some embellishment could have been done. There could have been some introspective discussion between Tintin and Haddock, for example, or Tintin could say more and emote more, or some inner thoughts of his could be revealed. He could even express his likes and dislikes for food or products or have hobbies. Perhaps it was decided that with this first film, which also captures the first meeting between Tintin and Haddock, not much would be done, but embellishment of Tintin's personality is a possibility for future films. In any event, I and others would welcome such an effort.<br/><br/>As for the complaint that linking Captain Haddock to the bottle was overemphasized vs. the Captain as a person, I felt this a little on the first watch, but on the subsequent watch, I said not really. For one key thing, he even lectures Tintin on not giving up, reversing roles that were displayed in several different Tintin books (including two cases in which Tintin used the bottle to change the Captain's mind). I also note that the two books this was based on, ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""The Crab with the Golden Claws,"" were the ones in which the Captain's whiskey and rum-guzzling were most prominent. So I cannot find much fault here, and even in other books, his drinking is always a theme. <br/><br/>I also had no problem with the inclusion of Bianca Castafiore, though she is not in either of the two books on which the film was (mainly) based. Her persona and physical appearance added something, and Spielberg's engineering of a voice for the glass-shattering Milanese Nightingale complemented Herge's genius. Captain Allan, Haddock's ancient rival, could have been given more personality. The absent Professor Calculus? Ready for the sequel. As for Thompson and Thomson, I thought Spielberg, using wit, actually managed to make them even more dense and bumbling in their quest for the pickpocket than in Herge's ""Secret of the Unicorn."" <br/><br/>All in all, a good effort by Spielberg, but I hope to see improvements in characterization in other Tintin films by him or whomever."

","Does Steven Spielberg ever sleep? I mean, the man vanished for three years, and in the course of four days released two films, The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse. The later received a Best Picture nomination. I have yet to see it, but I have just seen TAOT and it's pretty safe to say that Spielberg is back in his comfort zone.<br/><br/>His last film, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, was one of the highest grossing films of 2008. But a lot seemed disappointed by it. I personally liked it. Sure some parts were a little hokey and the final twist was a little out of this world(haha get it?) but other than that I thought it was good, old fashioned, Spielberg-ian fun. And it's safe to say that The Adventures of Tintin is the same way.<br/><br/>Spielberg's film is his first animated film, and it's based on a European cartoon by Herge. Tintin(voiced by Jamie Bell) is a journalist, who, with the help of his dog Snowy and a drunken captain named Braddock(voiced perfectly by Andy Serkis, who hsould have won an Oscar by now) to find a treasure.<br/><br/>The film is very similar to that of one of Spielberg's Indiana Jones films. It has the wild adventure, atmosphere, and dry humor of those films, which makes this a film that Spielberg was born to direct. The Adventures of Tintin reminds us of why we go to the movies, and why Steven Spielberg is one of the most famous directors of all time.<br/><br/>This is the best animated film of 2011. Yes, it's even better than Rango, which I really liked. It's so much fun. It's too much fun, to be honest. It's good to have one of Hollywood's finest directors back on the big screen.

","When I first saw the ads for this film my heart sank. It's been years of watching every beloved story from my childhood get butchered by Hollywood. Now Tintin? Damn! I didn't like the character design--why didn't they just reproduce Herge's characters in conventional animation? I felt sure they were going to make Tintin into some gloomy anti-hero with a tragic back story like the pouting brat in the last Indiana Jones movie--ugh!<br/><br/>Then I read a New Yorker review--a very negative review--complaining that the movie was non-stop action. ""What's Tintin's motivation? What's his background? What does he want?"" the review asked. And I thought ""Maybe Spielberg really did capture the naive spirit of Tintin.""<br/><br/>Did he ever. The Tintin stories are globe-trotting adventure at its innocent best, and so is this movie. No, Tintin doesn't suffer from angst and self-doubt--he's Action Boy! What's his motivation? An unquenchable thirst for adventure, that's what.<br/><br/>It takes a few minutes to get used to the character design, but you soon realize it's perfect, nothing like the creepy waxworks of Polar Express. I realized that two hours of looking at Herge's simple line work and flat colors would have been tedious. And the more naturalistic figures help to make the adventure thrilling.<br/><br/>The movie gets all the little things right, too. Captain Haddock's drinking is handled well, played for laughs but with a serious side. The secondary characters are great, especially the thuggish Allen. Even the Thompson twins, who got kind of annoying in the comics, have the right weight.<br/><br/>There are some sly references to other Peter Jackson and Spielberg films, good voice work all around, and even a cameo appearance by Herge himself. Snowy is just perfect--you feel he could have stolen the show, but Spielberg, who usually dumps on cuteness by the truckload, restrains himself admirably. For creative use of animation, this movie ranks with Toy Story or The Incredibles.<br/><br/>I wouldn't want every adventure movie to be this simple, but I'm glad this one came out just as it did. If you can't have fun watching Tintin, you don't know what fun is."

Steven Spielberg had a really good imagination for this wonderful scene! I also liked the scene where Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock were racing on their motor bike to get their last paper-clue from the Unicorn stolen by their enemies. The racing amused me very much(especially when Tintin gets his motor bike hanging on a electricity line(I THINK it was an electricity line, if it was one)! The racing was my favorite part of the film! This good Captain Haddock is always so funny!!! What made me really laugh was when Haddock was pointing a rocket launcher to blow up the vehicle of his enemies. Unlucky, he did not realize that the weapon was pointing at the wrong side and it shot behind him. You will not believe what incredible disaster he caused with his weapon, hahahahaha!!! Many scenes of the movie were very good! The only scene I wanted to ignore was when la Castafiore, an Italian woman was singing(her voice was so strong that she broke many glasses)! Captain Haddock is the funniest character in the film!! There was a LOT of GOOD actions.But the Thompsons and Haddock have a fat nose(that sounded pretty odd for me).

","I don't know if it's just me, but in all fairness, I found Tintin to be like a big, greasy burger from McDonalds. Sure it has the power to tempt you with its big lettuce and cheese and tomatoes and it's juicy patty... But even despite the yumminess of the burger, it's a dull experience overall as you've devoured nothing of actual substance.<br/><br/>I'll admit, for the first thirty minutes of Tintin, I was hooked. I hadn't read a single comic book, watched a single cartoon or even encounter a piece of literature that bore the name ""Tintin"" as a child, so this was all new experience to me. Unfortunately, the fun only lasted for thirty minutes. About two hours later, I left the cinema not only feeling dazed from all the 3D effects and always moving camera shots, but also wondering why they even bothered to try to make CG animated film out of something that clearly looked as if it wasn't meant to be a film.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong guys. I don't mean any disrespect to Stevie S, as he is a fantastic filmmaker and has made dozens of fantastic films throughout his career. But frankly, Tintin was just... Boring.<br/><br/>I think the biggest problem lies in its protagonist. Tintin is a very empty character and almost a Gary Stu. Everything seems to go exactly as planned for him and he seems to have no weaknesses or defaults. I'll remind you yet again that I didn't know anything about Tintin before going in, so I'm not sure if I missed the point of anything but really... He was just a dull character, and not interesting enough to warrant an entire movie based around him. <br/><br/>It really is a shame because Haddock, his partner was a fun and quirky character, and kept me watching. And the spine tingling chillingness of Daniel Craig's Saccharine was just mesmerizing, gorgeous to watch even and how he played the evil character nicely. So... Couldn't the movie's own damned protagonist do anything to show he's worthy of a movie?<br/><br/>I also don't know of this is just me, but I could tell the writers were trying to force too many eggs into one basket. I have no idea what stories this takes inspiration from but I just feel like this was just a bunch of stories mashed together with no cohesion. <br/><br/>However, at least it looked pretty. At least it gave me something to look at when I wasn't trying to wrap my head around the not very interesting story, or how many of those there were. Alas, this is a film I could see myself putting on at parties as a background type thing, you know? But if I were to try and sit through the film again, I'd have a headache from it all. So I guess my review should be a 3/10... But it did look pretty, so I'll give it a 5. For one it could have been a lot worse.<br/><br/>Hey, for one, we could have gotten another ""Immortals"" with this one. At least we didn't. At least."

","'THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN': Four Stars (Out of Five) .<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson produced this modern American adaptation of the popular long-running Belgian comic series (of the same name) by Georges Remi (who used the pen name Herge). The comics were about a young Belgian reporter named Tintin who got into many adventures with his dog Snowy and other companions he met along the way. Spielberg directed this first film in a planned trilogy under the agreement that Jackson will direct the second. He's been a fan of the series since 1981 when his classic action film 'RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK' was compared to it by critics. This 'performance capture 3D film' has been seen by many to be very much like another Indiana Jones film for Spielberg (except in animated form). I'd have to agree; if you're a fan of Tintin or Indiana Jones you're almost sure to enjoy this action adventure.<br/><br/>The screenplay was written by Edgar Wright (of 'SHAUN OF THE DEAD', 'HOT FUZZ' and'SCOTT PILGRIM' fame), Steven Moffat and Joe Cornish and based on three comic books from 1941 to 1944 ('The Crab with the Golden Claws', 'The Secret of the Unicorn' and 'Red Rackham's Treasure'). The story revolves around a clue to hidden treasure that Tintin (voiced by Jamie Bell) unwittingly comes into possession of when he buys a model ship, known as 'the Unicorn', at a market stall. He discovers that many want this clue, especially a man known as Sakharine (voiced by Daniel Craig) who will kill to get a hold of it. Tintin soon finds himself kidnapped (as well as his dog Snowy) by Sakharine and his men and aboard a cargo ship sailing to Morocco. On the boat Tintin teams with it's drunken Captain, Haddock (voiced by Andy Serkis), and together they try to beat Sakharine to the treasure by escaping and finding the other clues.<br/><br/>Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Toby Jones also do nice voice work in the film. The movie is a tad slow-paced at times but for the most part it's pretty action packed. The 3D animation looks spectacular and it's easily the best animated film I've seen all year, which makes it surprising that it didn't secure even a nomination for Best Animated Feature at this year's Oscars (especially when films like 'PUSS IN BOOTS' and 'KUNG FU PANDA 2' did!). It did get an Oscar nomination for Original Score though (by Spielberg's usual partner in crime John Williams) and won Best Animated Feature Film at the Golden Globe Awards. It should be seen as an impressive achievement by just about anyone's standards and deserves much more recognition. Hopefully more new fans will discover it over time.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ"

","We got a lot of good animated movies in 2011, Kung Fu Panda 2, Rio, Rango, and Whinnie the Pooh, but Steven Spielberg's, The Adventures of Tintin was my favorite. Maybe it is just because I'm a Spielberg fanboy and like anything he does. Not true, sure I haven't hated anything he has done so far, but I never saw 1941, and I wasn't a big fan of Catch me if you Can. Also, while I did enjoy them I was never the biggest fan of the Indiana Jones movies, they're fun, and I own them, but they didn't blow me away.<br/><br/>Tintin is Spielberg's first animated film, and man was it a lot of fun. The action scenes are so well choreographed, and they are able to get angles that they can't get in live action. The films highlight is a motorcycle chase through Morocco, which is a three minute chase scene all in one shot, not one cut, and it was amazing.<br/><br/>The acting is great, Andy Serkis plays Haddack and he is absolutely hilarious. But the one who steals the show for me was Snowy, he was funny as hell, and just so cute. And Thompson and Thompson have quite a few funny moments as well, although they aren't in the movie that long.<br/><br/>But that's all well and good, but what about the animation. I have actually only seen two motion capture animated film before, The Polar Express, and Monster House, both of which I really liked. However this animation is done by the same studio that did Avatar, and it looks great. While I was pretty much always aware that I was watching a cartoon, the animation is so well detailed that I can totally see people being fooled by it.<br/><br/>Tintin is one of Spielberg's best films, in terms of my personal favorites I would actually put this in front of Schindler's List. And there are supposed to be two more Tintin movies, the next one to be directed by Peter Jackson and produced by Spielberg, and the third to be co-directed by both of them, and I can't wait."

","My next movie review is on the movie ""The Adventures of Tintin,"" starring Tintin, Snowy, Captain Haddock, Thomson, and Thompson. I honestly had forgotten about Tintin. When I saw the previews for this movie it brought great joy because this is something that was apart of my childhood. Even though the cartoon series is a little blurry to me. <br/><br/>This movie is about the courageous Tintin going on a quest to find buried treasure! He gets clues as to what is going on and his curious nature attacks immediately!<br/><br/>Even though its a little typical I thought it was a well put together animation film. I liked it a lot and I'm looking forward to getting it on DVD. The adventure in the movie was on point! Everything you could ask for in this kind of movie. This movie was fun, exciting, adventurous, and had some comedy in it too. <br/><br/>I think lots of kids would like this movie. The only thing about kids watching this film that you should be aware of is that there is someone getting shot down in the movie and the captain is drinking though out the movie. If your child is mature enough to watch that than you and your family should have a great time watching this film. This is definitely going to be some kids favorite childhood movie. These type of films make me happy that I was born when I'm born so I can enjoy such movies.<br/><br/>A couple of little things that I liked about the movie are how the directors made a reference to the old ""Tintin"" television series. I also liked how when the pocket thief got smacked he had birds flying around his head. It reminded me of how cartoons were back in the day. It was a refreshing reminder. It immediately made me think of ""Roger Rabbit"" when the birds were flying around his head. Plus I thought Simon Pegg and Nick Frost were great picks to play the police officers Thomson and Thompson.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie an 8 out of 10. I enjoyed watching it and I can't wait to see the second movie that they obvious set us up for at the end of this one."
"MovieCriticDave","7","0","4","27 January 2012"," A wonderful ""Indiana Jones"" caliber adventure
","Animated films, having emerged from the shadows of second-tier theatrical status by the likes of Pixar, still derive their elemental success or failure from the quality of the writing. The Adventures of TinTin, a swashbuckling adventure adapted from the French comic books of the same name, is a delightful example of how great writing can combine with animated artistry to craft a wonderful film.<br/><br/>With the measured guidance of Steven Spielberg as its director, Adventures of TinTin sails effortlessly in a captivating but never overwhelming adventure of intrigue, humor, revenge, and harmless peril. TinTin, with his delightfully realized dog Snowy, exhibits a deft balance of action and story development that makes it impossible to look away as its story unfolds. <br/><br/>The story's title character, Tintin, embarks unknowingly on his adventure when nefarious characters become darkly fascinated with his purchase of a model ship from a street vendor. Realizing there is more to their interest than the ship itself, Tintin follows his instincts in a rousing worldwide adventure replete with fascinating characters, delightfully dislikeable bad guys, and a rousing conclusion, all wrapped in an unmistakably ""Indiana Jones"" themed and paced story. Combined with an Oscar-nominated score by the legendary John Williams, TinTin earns a hearty recommendation for adults and children alike.<br/><br/>The Adventures of TinTin is a hallmark for Spielberg, who provides a 3D version despite the fact it hardly needs it. A great story, converted into a visual medium by a great director, rarely needs such gimmickry, and TinTin surely falls in that class. You won't have to don 3D glasses to enjoy this fine film.<br/><br/>If only others borne of the 3D preoccupation would work so hard to create something even half so good, the entire movie-going world would benefit. <br/><br/>Bravo, Tintin!"

","My younger daughter is really the TinTin fan, but I'm not sure I could have gotten her to write this review. (it's hard enough to get her to do her homework.)<br/><br/>The modern version of Rotoscoping is done well enough where on occasion I could suspend noticing it was animation and not live action. In fact, this movie could have been done live action save for the search for an actor to play TinTin.<br/><br/>The movie does earn it's rating. Someone early in the film is shot dead in a hail of gunfire, but the impacts are shielded from the viewer and TinTin by the front door of his apartment building. My daughter wanted to duck out before this scene because she is enough of the TinTin fan to recognize the level of gunfire and the results in his stories.<br/><br/>Daniel Craig, who we're now conditioned to seeing as a hero (Cowboys and Aliens, Mr. Bond), is the villain here. In a complement on voice acting, to me he does not sound like James.<br/><br/>It may have been the theater, but for a children's series it was dead quiet at the beginning and quiet (almost except for my daughter, who tends to make a running commentary). When the lights went up, I found out that most the audience was adults, especially groups of adults. One group included an elderly lady with a French accent to whom I commented that she probably read the stories in French and not the ugly English translation.<br/><br/>The film works well enough to earn an eight in my book."
"ricardopthomaz","10","0","4","21 January 2012"," Blistering barnacles!!! Perfect adaptation!!!
","I am a huge Tintin fan since I was 12! I used to watch the Nelvana cartoon with my family back in the 90's and I never missed one single episode of it!! Besides, that's the TV series that introduced me to the character.<br/><br/>Having grown up with the series, at that time I had no idea that it was inspired on a series of comics written by Belgian writer George Remi (Hergé), so when Internet finally came in the late 90's I started to search for those comics, and boy, I had a hell of a thrill ride!<br/><br/>With that said, needless to say that I was eagerly waiting for this movie! Of course there is some other movie adaptations out there, but truth being told, they never made much justice to the supreme creation of Hergé.<br/><br/>By the way, Hergé used to say that the only person alive capable of taking his creation to the big screen was Steven Spielberg. And boy, he was 100% right!!<br/><br/>This first adaptation of the Tintin adventures around the world is brilliant!! More than brilliant!! It's perfect!! Seriously, the only thing more perfect than this would be if Spielberg copied the entire stories from the comics to the form of a movie. And don't get me wrong, he did keep the original story by Hergé almost intact in this movie, but being the great filmmakers that he and Peter Jackson are, they decided to have a take on more than one story per movie and put those stories to work together as a whole. Did it work? Oh yeah!<br/><br/>In this first movie of a hopeful long series of movies (Hergé made 24 Tintin stories!!) they decide to introduce us to the characters. They introduce to the Tintin rookies the main character, the reporter Tintin and his dog Milou, who are two courageous fellas who are always ready for adventure. We also manage to meet the Dupont twins on this movie, two silly and dumb police officers and Captain Haddock, the longtime friend of the main character. Even the Moulinsart Castle and the lovely Bianca Castafiore was there.<br/><br/>The stories chosen to this movie was ""The Crab with the Golden Claws"" (where Tintin and Haddock met for the first time), ""The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""The Red Rackham's Treasure"", three of the most exciting stories of the Tintin collection.<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic, fluent and the digital sets take your breath away. The acting is superb, they got the right cast to act, Andy Serkis as Haddock is spectacular!! And that's another strong point in the movie, the characterization of almost every character on Tintin's universe was kept intact, except for Dr. Sakharin, who in the original stories was never a descendant from Red Rackham, but it was a nice addition and brought more drama and interesting developments to the script.<br/><br/>The humor is top notch!! I laughed out loud with the drunk jokes in the movie, in fact, I laughed out loud in the entire movie!! It was fantastic!! Being able to see all those beloved characters from my youth in the big screen exactly the way I used to know them was just great!!<br/><br/>As for the story, well it's the story everyone as a fan already know. It was the same story we know from the comics and the Nelvana cartoon, but told differently, so, except for the Sakharin development, there was no surprises at all for me in terms of story.<br/><br/>The only character I missed on the movie was Professor Tryphon Tournesol. I just love this scientist. He is deaf, but doesn't know it, so he gets everything wrong and usually causes a lot of trouble, but he have a heart of gold. I was eagerly hoping to see Prof. Tournesol on the movie with his shark submarine, but I guess I'll have to wait for the next one.<br/><br/>And boy, I will be eagerly waiting for the next one, the one Peter Jackson will direct. I seriously hope to see more Tintin movies from now on. I'm also really sad that the film went so bad in the USA, I guess US people didn't get the point of Tintin, but I hope they will next time.<br/><br/>Anyway, great movie, wonderful adaptation, I hope to see more of this, and I will finish my review by saying: Great Snakes and Blistering Barnacles!! Go for Tintin!!! You won't regret it!!"

","This is probably Spielberg's best adventure film since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, and he demonstrates how awesome motion capture animated films can be. He takes to the medium like a fish to water, and the whole thing is just an awesome spectacle. It almost seems like the film is populated with human actors wearing cartoon costumes. Its odd, but not at all offputting. The performances are uniformly good, but once again we have a motion capture performance by Andy Serkis (here playing Captain Haddock) which is just outstanding. Not only the physical acting, but the voice acting, which he also performed, are absolutely wonderful. Jamie Bell plays Tintin. The character's an institution in Europe, but pretty unknown in the United States (thankfully I used to watch the British animated series, which aired on HBO in the early '90s - I vividly remember the subplot about the pickpocket that appears here from that show). Perhaps people will catch up to Tintin and be there more for the two sequels (which will be directed by Peter Jackson, who consulted with Spielberg, who has owned the movie rights since the '80s, on this one)."

","The Adventures of Tintin is an exceptional piece of work; this and Super 8 really seemed to capture the nostalgic, heartwarming tone of some of Spielberg other classics like Jurassic Park and The Goonies. The movie is very long, especially for a children's film, but it goes by in a flash. As I left the theater, I found myself wanting more.<br/><br/>The story is very convoluted and adrenaline filled. and it's sure to entertain kids, as well as adults that read the original Tintin comics. I'll admit I have not read the comics, so I don't know if this film follows the integral story ark of the comics or if they just made it up. But, standing on it's own, it's good. There's some pacing issues and I would have liked to see more done with the mystery of the Unicorn, rather than it being a cat-and-mouse/revenge scheme, but I digress.<br/><br/>I feel bad saying this, but the character of Tintin is very bland. Again, I haven't read the comics, but judging by this film, he's just a generic hero; a journalist that will do anything to get the scoop on the latest story. I wouldn't mind so much if they'd given him more personality. But for Tintin's weaknesses, the movie makes up for it with a lot of colorful side characters. Andy Serkis is enjoyable comic relief as the drunken, but good intentioned Captain Haddock. Daniel Craig is delightfully over-the-top as the movies villain Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine. And Simon Pegg and Nick Frost play a pair of bumbling, likable sidekicks named Thompson.<br/><br/>I'm glad the Peter Jackson and Steven Spielberg wait a few years to bring us this movie, because the special effects are great. I haven't seen it in 3D, but it's not converted, and there are a lot of scenes that, I'd imagine, would look great in 3D.<br/><br/>Final verdict: This is summer blockbuster brought to us in the winter. It's good fun for the whole family. If you can sit back and enjoy yourself for 107 minutes, just admiring the fantastic visuals and funny side characters. you'd like this. I myself wish it wasn't so simplistic, but for what it is, it's a good movie."
"kunalkhandwala","8","0","2","14 January 2012"," The adventures of our boyhood hero
","To do any justice to Herge's Tintin, its cinematic adaptation would have to be animated. But when you have two legendary film-makers who revel in fantastic adventures, a simple animated version would be quite banal by their standards. Enter Peter Jackson's WETA, which excels in performance capture animation, having created several LOTR characters and the Apes that took over our world recently. For Tintin's loyal fans worldwide (barring the non- existent ones in USA), the film had to create magic and capture the essence of Herge's adroitly written mysteries. Anything less would be blasphemy. With Steven Spielberg at the helm, our young journalist-detective is brought to life on the big screen in an inconceivable form that is both revolutionary and awe-inspiring. The lines between reality and animation have seldom been so blurry. Screenwriters Steven Moffat ('Doctor Who', 'Sherlock'), Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, draw inspiration from 3 of Herge's popular books to create a fun- filled adventure.<br/><br/>Upon procuring a model of a ship named 'The Unicorn', Tintin (voiced-Jamie Bell) soon discovers its historic legend of a secret cargo and its fateful end under the captaincy of Sir Francis Haddock. As he advances on his quest, guided by a hidden scroll in the model, Tintin ends up on the Karaboujan, where he encounters Captain Haddock (voiced – Andy Serkis), who is rarely sober and always on the edge. Aboard the ship, Sakharine (voiced -Daniel Craig), who had the other scroll, is in command of his gang that aids him in his pursuit of the Unicorn's secret. Tintin, Haddock and Snowy manage to escape, only to crash land into the Moroccan desert, a little ways from their destination, the port of Bagghar. This is where the final piece of the puzzle rests within the Sheikh's well protected model of the Unicorn. Now, it will take Sakharine's beguiling abilities, the acrobatic, relentless and witty efforts of Tintin, Snowy and Captain Haddock to retrieve this last clue to The Unicorn's Secret. But there is something more that Sakharine wants out of this quest....<br/><br/>The film is based on 3 books of Tintin's adventures: The Secret of the Unicorn, Red Rackham's Treasure and The Crab with the Golden claws. Even though the thrill of such an adventurous story could not be as engaging as the books or the TV series, Spielberg and Jackson must be credited for achieving such technological breakthroughs and relating it all to Tintin's spirit of unravelling great mysteries. The essence of Herge's books is still present and that is what Tintin fans worldwide, will certainly acknowledge. Spielberg and the WETA team make Herge's storyboard almost come to life. Screen transitions occur in bubbles and reflections but Snowy, who may not have a thought cloud, is expressive enough to be taken for a real white terrier. Apart from this aide of Tintin's, a testament to the film's technical achievement is notably in two sequences. Captain Haddock relives the story of his ancestor's encounter with the pirate Red Rackham by enacting it all. We are smoothly and unknowingly transitioned through the two periods as Francis Haddock and Red Rackham engage in a stunningly choreographed duel. The other, is an inconceivable sequence in Bagghar's streets when Tintin, Haddock, Snowy and Sakharine's forces chase his falcon to retrieve the scrolls it obtained from the Sheikh's model ship. Sakharine in a car chase, Tintin on a motorbike pursuit, Snowy's acrobatic chase, Haddock's balancing act alongside Tintin and a sliding hotel building, all filmed as a single, breath-taking shot. <br/><br/>At the end of it all, after marvelling at Spielberg and Weta's spectacular performance- capture animation technique that brought the boyhood hero Tintin on the big screen, one will be in equal awe of their ability to recreate the magic of Herge's works from familiar characters to iconic scenes and grippy story-telling. Thomson & Thompson are still the good natured imbeciles and there's the opera singer Bianca Castafiore whom Haddock simply cannot stand. Snowy is still the smartest dog around and our young reporter-detective escapes near death while unravelling a mystery, only to lead up to the next one. All of it, just as we read in Herge's books and watched it on the TV series. North America may be oblivious to Tintin's legend but the rest will have a blast at the most adventurous escapade led by Jackson and Captain Spielberg.<br/><br/>8.77 on a scale of 1-10."

Tintin's dog Snowy is the perfect partner and companion for our protagonist. He is integral to the plot and rendered wonderfully. As a small child my father read me Tintin books. Later I bought and enjoyed the many adventures myself. Snowy was my favorite character as Hergé would sometimes reveal his thoughts in one-word balloons.

A couple of people offer him money for it, but he refuses.

You get to hear an interesting story while at the same time watching it unfold before your eyes. My mom and I saw this in standard, not 3D. But wow, in 3D I think this movie would be absolutely amazing. When the ships are going in the water or a fight scene comes on, it would probably blow your mind. I think the movie had a good mix of action, mystery and adventure. I never really felt like I was getting to much or to little of any of them.

","Spielberg has always been the master of using the locale extensively - a fact subtly demonstrated by the ripples-in-the-water-glass scene in Jurassic Park. In a film by Steven Spielberg, the surroundings are rarely allowed to go wasted; almost everything is put to use in one way or the other, making the movie more vibrant and lifelike - as if the objects in the film have life themselves. Tintin follows this precedent. The Adventures of Tintin too involves the ardoit usage of the environs - may it be the falcon chase sequence or even the battle with the cranes. This trademark move appears succinctly in places, giving it a distinct Spielberg-ian feel and making Tintin another feather in his fedora. <br/><br/>Doing justice to the character created by Herge', Tintin (Jamie Bell) remains the bland, ageless adventurer that he originally was. A miniature, antique ship is broken in his apartment. He meets the villain Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig) in a dilapidated bungalow and chances upon another ship of similar make. Tintin's sense of adventure leads him deeper into the mysterious abyss and only when a man is shot at his door do the dangers of the situation dawn upon him. Never being one to shirk from trouble, he delves head-first into the adventure as he, Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis) and his dog, Snowy, are tossed from the land to the sea to the Sahara, into a farrago of pickpockets, detective lookalikes, an overambitious antagonist, an inebriated captain and Unicorns, all in a quest to find a sunken treasure and resolve vendettas that have returned to haunt from the dead. <br/><br/>This beautiful film reiterates why I hold well-made animated films so close to my heart. Animated movies, almost always, are filled with exuberance, joy and life. Rarely do they allow ennui to creep into your heart. With it witty punchlines, affable characters and adrenaline- pounding action-adventure sequences, Tintin the movie brings forth such excitement that is rarely displayed in movies. Through the interplay of bright colours, an overwhelming soundtrack and ebullient demeanour, it takes you to the point of wanting to jump and cheer the protagonist through this arduous journey.<br/><br/>Tintin precisely captures what an adventure means. Similar to the Indiana Jones movies, it doesn't tax your grey-cells by keeping the plot very basic instead. But the hardships the protagonists have to undergo to accomplish that goal keep the movie ticking, and make it so appealing. Tintin gets chased by a vicious dog, chases a falcon, flies an airplane, gets shot at - but keeps trudging along. By not delving into various intricacies in an attempt to superficially deepen the plot, the movie keeps the real Tintin alive - light-hearted, simple and pure fun - and it has been a while since we saw such films. <br/><br/>The target audience of the film isn't entirely clear, because it works well for everyone. Grey-heads who lived in the Tintin comic-book age will pounce upon the opportunity to revel in the nostalgia, while children, who have no idea of who Tintin is whatsoever, will also be equally delighted by the introduction they are provided with him. Very rare movies are able to accomplish the extraordinary feat of holding a natural appeal to people of all ages, so Tintin does score points here. <br/><br/>All the characters have been portrayed in a remarkable manner. Add to this the fact that they have been created by some of the most lifelike animation I have seen in recent years. Tintin is spot on; sharp as a whip, brave in the face of danger and persistent. The innocuous detective twins, Thomson and Thompson (Nick Frost and Simon Pegg), are classic comic characters; they unwittingly get involved into things of gigantic proportions without having a clue of what's happening. They are naive to the point of being nincompoops and the acts they commit under the impression of mistakes accounts for plenty of smiles, if not outright laughter. Sakharine is the perfect Tintin nemesis - evil, for difficult to despise - just as the villains of children's' movies are meant to be. Captain Haddock, however, steals the spotlight. This Captain and his alcohol-addled brain make a bold impression, one stronger than Tintin himself, bringing back memories of the original character. A Haddock always remains a Haddock, even if he is brought back to life after years of virtual non-existence. <br/><br/>Mr. Spielberg does nothing wrong in the film, yet it doesn't come across as extremely strong. This is the kind of film that you can watch hundreds of times for the very reason because of which it loses out, though slightly - the lack of complexities. It is too simple - a hunt for a treasure being the oldest trick in the book. However, Tintin isn't James Bond. He was always meant to be the soft-spoken, almost effiministic ideator, and that is how the world likes him."

","Welcome back Mr. Spielberg! Does anyone know adventure like he does? In his first animated adventure Spielberg brings to life the iconic comic book sleuth/Journalist and I loved every minute of it. From the streets of France to the desert, to the Ocean, to Africa and beyond, it has everything a great adventure needs and could want and has some truly terrific characters. Kids, adults, young at heart will love this action packed, edge of your seat thrill ride with a great mystery. Many of the complaints I heard about the film is that perhaps it was almost a little too action packed, as they did seem to cram as much as they could all into one film but you can't chastise them for being too ambitious. Being an animated film, even motion capture, means that they can do some pretty outstanding and crazy stunts and comedic moments but still keep it real. The motion capture animation is stunning and truly unique and I hope they do more of this type of animation and Spielberg and Jackson do it better than anyone.<br/><br/>The voice acting is brilliant. Jamie Bell captures Tin Tin absolutely perfectly. He has the innocence and the curiosity and the heroism down to perfection. Andy Serkis, a brilliant talent, who has made absolute perfection out of motion capture in films like Rise of the Planet of The Apes, and King Kong, and Lord of The Rings and now shines as Tin Tin's partner in mystery Captain Haddock. The alcoholic anti-hero is hilarious and fun however almost over used but still a lot of fun and the perfect balance to prim and proper Tin Tin. Daniel Craig is terrific as the villainous Sakharine, and his voice is barely recognizable. Nick Frost and Simon Pegg also do a great job as the comedic and bumbling Thomson and Thompson.<br/><br/>Tin Tin is part Indiana Jones, part old school mystery and all fun. Spielberg knows how to spin a story and no holds barred adventure and isn't afraid to tread lightly and follow politically correct movie barriers (a character is seen smoking and of course Haddock's insatiable drinking problem), neither of these things will send anyone off to buy cigarettes and a carton of rum and they are just a small part of the adventure. Maybe not for young kids but certainly older kids and adults will absolutely love it and for good reason! The story borders on being a little too complicated but it stays within the realm of understanding and when the film is all over you will wish to see it all again or better yet see another adventure of this terrific iteration of Tin Tin that was YEARS in the making. Do yourself a favor and see this terrific movie. The 3D was okay but as usual doesn't make or break the film. You can see it either way. 9/10"

","I went into this film looking forward to another Steven Spielberg spectacle, and I got one!<br/><br/>This film is truly one of the best films I've seen in 2011. It is certainly a perfect family film and a perfect fan-boy experience for those who either know the comic series or love adventure films like Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>I can without doubt say I loved this film. The action was good, the humor was good natured and it was a very simple and compelling story.<br/><br/>The past few mo-cap films I've seen (Beowulf and Polar Express) failed to amaze me, but this film gets it right in all degrees, (Not expecting any less from Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson).

","Despite the slight hype that went into this movie, I didn't find this movie to be all that great. But it's still a pretty darn good adventure movie that kids and adults can enjoy, in fact it's a good family flick. I could also tell a lot of effort has be put into this movie and the animation is really well done. I never even knew about the comic book that this movie is based and although the comics came out in 1929. It still has that modern feel to it that seemed well fitted into the movie. Maybe Steven Spielberg was a fan of this comic to the point he decided to make a full animated CGI movie of it which is understandable. I would too as well if I was a director and was a fan of a series of something while growing up. Again I didn't find this movie to be amazing or anything but it's a pretty good adventure movie that is worth taking the whole family to see.<br/><br/>6.8/10"
"estreet-eva","6","0","2","2 January 2012"," ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" if Indy was young and Belgian
","Spielberg digitally exercises his penchant for highly elaborate action sequences in this adaptation of the Belgian serial cartoon. The media allows the director to supersize these set pieces to epic proportions including floods and entwined flying sailing ships. Your reaction to the movie will largely depend on whether you find such rapidly unrolling mayhem exhilarating or tiresome. One suspects the film will split somewhat along gender lines with boys, in particular, finding the flying machines and crashing cars to be a good time. A note to parents that the action here, like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", is served up with a pretty healthy degree of gunfire and alcohol consumption by Captain Haddock and, oddly, Tintin's dog ""Snowy."" If the film has the feel of ""Raiders"", it surreptitiously cribs the entire main action sequence from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End."" In fact, the use of digit special effects, the presence of pirates and entangled, burning boats make the sequences difficult to tell apart. In short, the film isn't quite the ""event"" that Spielberg envisioned but it is solidly entertaining in that old-fangled cliffhanger serial way."

"Fields201","9","0","1","30 December 2011"," Surprisingly Fun
","I haven't seen a movie for a while because Twilight: Breaking Dawn had sucked the life out of me. Since then, I missed out on what probably were some entertaining films but I was drained and needed a break. Now I'm back in seeing Adventures of Tintin and I was very much entertained.<br/><br/>The story in a nutshell is that Tintin (which me and some other people thought that was the name of the dog but surprisingly it was the guy) happens to buy some ship from some dealer. Then for some reason, buying that ship meant he had some people who want to kill him. Interesting, because the dealer didn't seem like he had too many problems. Anyway, so the ship gets stolen and Tintin and his dog Snowy embark on some quest to retrieve the ship and some missing notes. It's all for this treasure, which, to my knowledge, doesn't go further than that. No one is trying to take over the world or anything, just some rich guy who looks suspiciously like Spielberg wanting to get richer.<br/><br/>I really liked the look and atmosphere of the film. The color and the lighting that they use is fantastic. The animation is top notch, too. I could even go as far as saying this is the best CG animation I have ever seen. Sometimes I literally thought it was live action. The action scenes are thrilling and they are easily some of the best action scenes I've seen in a while. I also loved the dog, Snowy.<br/><br/>A good film always has its shortcomings and I would have to say that the Haddock character who comes midway through the movie really bogs the film down, especially for the last half. He's annoying and just plain odd. The film had a really good tone going but some of his scenes make it feel like a totally different film than what it should be (like him belching into the fuel tank of a plane). Also, he has this weird back story which really doesn't make sense. I don't want to give anything away, but the payoff just didn't seem realistic to me. <br/><br/>If you liked Indiana Jones, the Uncharted games, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Goonies, then this film puts them in a blender and spits them out. It really is a great adventure film. I'm looking forward to part 2!"

","Took my two nephews to see this. There were other children with parents in the theatre. Spielberg really comes through on the animation. 3D animation brought it out even better. If you're into this, then you need to see this move. It has quite of bit of action. There are twists and turns wherever you turn. TinTin and Snowy fell into all sorts of mishap and adventure. My nephews particularly liked the scene with in the airplane. Yet, I observed that the movie theatre was very quiet. (Which they should be anyway). But when you're in there with children, usually you may get some oohs or aahs. There weren't any in this movie. In fact, I noticed some children sleeping. This movie really must hit a certain age group, as some children have moved on to the luster of their Wii games. This movie had too many ho-hum moments. But it looks like there would be a niche for this type of animation and it may catch on. It seems to be holding its own at the box office."

","The long gestating love-child of Steven Spielberg (directing) and Peter Jackson (producing), Tintin is unquestionably the most hyped motion picture released on Boxing Day in Oz this year, partially to its detriment. Utilising performance-capture animation for the first time, Spielberg has given himself the opportunity to craft some visually wonderful sequences – the chase at the beginning of the last act is terrific – but unfortunately can't quite concoct a story that matches. Regardless, Jamie Bell and mo-cap legend Andy Serkis share a pleasant chemistry as Tintin and Captain Haddock respectively, whilst the boy reporter's loyal dog Snowy is an excellent sidekick. The undercooked premise and failing comedic duo Thomson and Thompson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) aside, this is a fun-filled adventure worthy of a trip to the cinema, be it with your mates or with your little nippers."

","yes, I did enjoy most of this movie. Considering myself as someone who knows the books, backgrounds, chronology etc. by heart I would like to point out, where this movie fails and where not - just imho of course!<br/><br/>pros: - bringing the characters and images to life like this is nothing less but what I would call a great and impressive success! - directing/blending over to the background story works perfectly and is as smooth as it could get! - many references for fans honoring tintin's and Herge'e background. - opening sequence including introduction of Tintin in the beginning works fine! A deep bow for the books and their creator! (though it feels like just another spielberg'esque opening title... don't get me wrong: it worked perfectly! was just nothing new or rare to see...) - references to other books of the series worked just fine withing the situations! - the story preserved and worked on several layers and location together. - The music felt perfect! Original, appropriate and supporting! No annoying pop-songs just to sell soundtracks!<br/><br/>cons: - I still don't see any reason to go for 3D but to make piracy harder to film off the silver screen... it barely adds anything to the movie. It makes everything just darker, which I don't appreciate... Furthermore it seems to make filmmakers go crazy about pointy and flying objects... so far it only worked for me in Tron because it added dimension to the story, literally. - Though the books have their origin in the slapstick comedy in the 1920s it is a little overdone here. But that might be a matter of personal preference. - Haddock is a little to vulgar with his alcohol issues... running on fumes... well... those situations are what I would consider as clearly overstepping the boundaries of the originals... - mixing several stories felt a little bumpy and less thought through... more like a collage with more or less hard edges... - Spielberg... to put this the most respectful and diplomatic way: his way of story telling is absolutely nothing for me! I don't like being told what I see, I don't need characters to think aloud about what is going on... to be fair: he did worse in the past... still: if you need to explain what is going on, if you need off voices or repetition: please consider questioning the approach of directing in first place! - The whole story was cut down to pure adventure and treasure hunt, without leaving room for any deeper connotations... <br/><br/>I was excited when I learned that Moffat would write the script, honestly: I see his work based of the last two seasons of Doctor Who much more skeptical... I was not happy about Spielbergs involvement, though there might not have been any way around him for this project... after Indy and his long time involvement in the making/holding the rights... At least, and last but not least: I believe we all have to thank Peter Jackson for his impact on this work! Visually great and as faithful to the comic books as possible! Sadly Moffat seems not to care about plausibility nor about continuity and Spielberg did not care to fix this... <br/><br/>So it is just like with too many others: watch with your eyes only and skip all other parts of your head. If you are not familiar with Tintin at all: have a great time with a fine piece of movie."

Lots of larger-than-life, over-the-top action, not unworthy of the original material. Well worth seeing in 3D.

"barnabyrudge","7","0","3","25 December 2011"," Long-awaited big screen version of Tintin - fast, fun and beautifully animated.
","Steven Spielberg has had periodic breaks in his directing career – almost four years elapsed between Schindler's List and Jurassic Park: The Lost World; a three year hiatus from Saving Private Ryan to AI: Artificial Intelligence; and after Munich it was three years until the emergence of Indiana Jones And The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull. Spielberg tends to remain very active as a producer and executive producer whilst away from the director's chair, but movie lovers everywhere are always most eager to see what he will next come up with when wearing his director's hat. After the relative disappointment of the fourth Indy film (critically at least, though commercially it performed well), it's good to report that Spielberg is back to pretty good form with The Adventures Of Tintin: Secret Of The Unicorn.<br/><br/>Youthful Belgian reporter Tintin (voice of Jamie Bell) purchases a beautiful model ship at a flea market. Shortly after, he is approached by the menacing Ivan Sakharine (voice of Daniel Craig) who is desperate to buy the model, and who gets particularly aggressive when Tintin refuses to part with it. Slowly Tintin discovers that the model is one of three identical ships made many years earlier to show the whereabouts of a lost treasure. Sakharine turns out to be a descendant of notorious buccaneer Red Rackham. He has dedicated his life to tracking down the sunken treasure of Sir Francis Haddocke, captain of the Unicorn, a 17th Century treasure ship which was attacked by Red Rackham whilst laden with riches. Haddocke sank his ship rather than allowing his precious cargo to fall into pirate hands, but devised the three model ships to act as clues to the position of the vast treasure. Now Sakharine hopes to locate this unimaginable missing wealth. Tintin joins forces with hard-drinking Captain Haddock (voice of Andy Serkis) – modern day ancestor of Sir Francis – and together they race to be first to solve the riddle of the lost treasure.<br/><br/>In essence, Tintin is very similar to an Indiana Jones movie, with its combination of globe-trotting adventures and spectacular action sequences. It is Spielberg's first animated film and the animation is absolutely stunning throughout, with amazing attention to detail. The vocal acting is generally good, especially Serkis whose booze-sodden Captain Haddock is a wonderfully humorous creation. The story attempts to combine elements of three of the original Hergé books - The Crab With The Golden Claws, The Secret Of The Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure. At times, the narrative stretches coincidences to breaking point; at others, the action threatens to become almost too frenetic and overwhelming for the film's own good. But overall, The Adventures Of Tintin: Secret Of The Unicorn is a rip-roaring adventure caper that throws in everything but the kitchen sink for the sake of a good show. On this evidence, viewers will be looking forward to the inevitable sequel with plenty of anticipation."

Snowy antics make him the crowd favorite easily, but since we touched upon Haddock- well, he simply rocked. Andy Serkis is a superstar at motion capture (think Gollum, King Kong) and here he steals every scene as the grumpy but endearing, booze crazy Archibald Haddock...hell, so towering is he that they should have called this movie the Adventures of Captain Haddock! <br/><br/>The most enjoyable movie of the year so far, will satisfy old fans, and create new ones.

","The Adventures of Tintin (2011) directed by Steven Spielberg, screenplay by Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish. Starring (voices by) Jamie Bell, Andy Serkis, Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg, Daniel Mays, Gad Elmaleh, and Toby Jones.<br/><br/>Even before any real footage was shown, I knew that the Adventures of Tintin was going to be well done, because it wasn't done in live-action. I don't think the concept of Tintin would work all that well in live action (the French already tried this, and those films are not very good from what I've heard). Additionally Herge himself approved of Steven Spielberg, saying before his death that if any director could be perfect at making a Tintin film, that Spielberg was the one.<br/><br/>Thankfully I got exactly what I wanted, because the Adventure of Tintin is a great adventure film, based off one of France's most iconic characters.<br/><br/>The story combines three Tintin stories (The Crab with the Golden Claws, The Secret of the Unicorn and Red Rackham's Treasure), and puts them into one film. Tintin (played by Jamie Bell) a reporter (not Belgium for any fans who interested), stumbles upon, and purchases a model ship called the Unicorn at a market stall. Tintin becomes interested in it after the mysterious Mr. Sakharine (Daniel Craig, completely unrecognizable) wants it. Eventually Tintin finds himself embroiled in an adventure to find out about the secrets of the Unicorn.<br/><br/>The Adventures of Tintin is a film using motion caption (a term used to describe the process of recording movement and translating that movement on to a digital model), and admittedly that's probably where the Adventures of Tintin suffers most. While this isn't exactly the Uncanny Valley (I swear those posters with Bianca Castafiore look too real to be animated), it's still not the best it could possibly be. If I were to come in and having never seen a movie using Motion Caption (which Thankfully I have), I would find the faces of the characters to be freaky. The motion caption in this movie is however better than the motion caption that was used in the Polar Express, or 2009's A Christmas Carol, and does show some improvements, often veering between real and unreal. <br/><br/>The acting (or voice acting), is good. Jamie Bell is decent in the title role, although his character is not well developed (Tintin's character development is not the focus of the stories anyway). Andy Serkis does a great job playing the character of Captain Archibald Haddock, the descendant of Sir Francis Haddock (the Captain of the Unicorn), having a fairly decent Scottish accent (although to be fair his nationality was never directly been revealed in the comics). As I said earlier Daniel Craig comes off as being unrecognizable as Ivan Sakharine the villain (who's character was actually not a villain in the original story but a collector of ships), complete with a different voice. The team of Nick Frost and Simon Pegg add humor (and maybe some unnecessary humor) as the two inept Scotland Yard detectives Thompson and Thomson. The characters have some funny scenes, but I wasn't laughing at all their antics. <br/><br/>The score by John Williams (who else could score a Steven Spielberg film?) is well done, while not as memorable as Indiana Jones, it still has it's own beat.<br/><br/>The writers Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright, and Joe Cornish have written a grand adventure story, with some comical moments through in their for good measure.<br/><br/>The opening sequences is well done, with a jazzy tune, showing Tintin running through a series of comics.<br/><br/>The ending leaves the film open for a sequel, and I can only hope that the U.S. is willing to give Tintin a chance, because dismal box office in the U.S. may persuade Paramount to can the sequel they already announced (thankfully it's been doing gangbusters oversees, so that may change their minds).<br/><br/>The adventures of Tintin is a thrilling and fun adventure movie, featuring some of the better use of Motion Caption. With Tintin Steven Spielberg has crafted another fine adventure film."

","Tintin: ""How's your thirst for adventure, Captain?"" Captain Haddock: ""Unquenchable.""<br/><br/>My best overall entertainment for the family at 2011 holiday time goes to Steven Spielberg's The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn. The motion-capture and 3-D enhance the action, ramp it up if you will so that you are immersed in the action and wondering at how life-like the characters are even though animated.<br/><br/>Director Spielberg was reading the international serial books about young reporter/sleuth, Tintin, by Belgian artist Hergé, while working on his Indiana Jones franchise. It's easy to see the influences on both sides especially Spielberg's enduring child-like enthusiasm for adventure and his mastery of the camera point of view. We soar with planes and birds and spend not inconsiderable time up close with those expressive faces. <br/><br/>As in the originals, this Tintin adaptation, set in mid-twentieth Europe, is episodic with numerous mini adventures young hero Tintin (Jamie Bell) goes through to find a 17th-century treasure that 1/3 of the map he found in a model ship points to. Sir Frances Haddock (Andy Serkis) long ago planted three parts of the map, and a sodden contemporary descendant, Captain Haddock (Serkis), helps Tintin and faithful dog, Snowy, recover his family's fortune and reputation.<br/><br/>The action is non-stop, from motorcycle to seaplane (most of the vehicles Indiana Jones used as well), and the humor is pleasantly understated:<br/><br/>Captain Haddock: ""So you thought you'd sneak in an' catch me with me trousers down, eh?"" Tintin: ""Would rather you kept your trousers on if it's all the same to you.""<br/><br/>Most of all it's Spielberg's infectious enthusiasm that carries the picture. If for nothing else, enjoy the visual references to his earlier movies like Jaws and Indiana Jones and marvel how storyteller Spielberg can adapt a well-known series, and with the help of computer graphics, imitate a world so much like his own.<br/><br/>(in a plane) Captain Haddock: ""You do know what you're doing, right?""

Like Avatar, your eyes are unsure whether you are seeing something as photo-real or pure animation. Textures of the ground, skin, rusty walls, and so on have an incredible detail to them. Spielberg seems especially keen on the use of reflections in glass as part of his new bag of toys. There is nonstop movement from perspectives and transitions that are no different than a painter who makes optical illusions within his work.<br/><br/>I say Spielberg, along with Peter Jackson, have reinvented the genre, because the use of editing along with the camera choreography provides the benefits of editing in normal comics, where each panel acts as an edit. Each shot is essentially a work of art. In fact in this genre, it is less effective to try the action scene done all in one shot. It starts to feel too much like a video game. But what about story? George Lucas made similar advances with the new Star Wars Trilogy, but the story dragged. I am not familiar with the books the movie is based on. But you get a great idea of the tone as the young boy and his dog dodge bullets and find themselves in harm's way, albeit knowing that they can outsmart or basically allow the folly of the bad guys to do themselves in. So yes there is story. The adventures have a great deal of flair to them. One particular scene on a ship involves sneaking into the crews' barracks. The entire room is alive as the motion of the waves rocks the boat, causing the bodies and objects to slide back and forth with slapstick pratfalls that resembled an old Looney Tunes cartoon.<br/><br/>The extent of the boy's adventures is no doubt geared for young adults, there is no love interest. But it doesn't matter, when the momentum of the story and epic production cast a spell on the audience, you become a kid again yourself. One may actually experience that ""Indiana Jones Magic"", where you find yourself grinning as you watch the director spin a narrative that is as fun as a Disneyland ride. Part of that magic comes from the John Williams score (which borrows heavily on Indiana Jones). It ceases to amaze me how the man can still churn out intelligent music for so many decades. I didn't care for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, although I liked some of the over-the-top action sequences that had a cartoon like quality. In Tintin, it IS a cartoon, and the action sequences go even more over-the-top. The only complaint you may find is that there is almost too much action. By the end of the third act, your stomach may start to get queasy as you spin around and around as the action unfolds.<br/><br/>I give this a 7 out of 10 only because it is entirely possible that the sequel could be even better than this."
"mgruebel","7","0","2","22 December 2011"," A matinée adventure close to Hergé's spirit
","The dynamic duo of Spielberg and Jackson has done a very nice job here, bringing to simulated life the adventures of a young reporter and his always-drunk captain sidekick to find secret plans of treasure in a bottled ship.<br/><br/>There is plenty of adventure for young and old unfamiliar with Tintin, and of course a trip to childhood memories for those who know the comic books. There's every reason to hope Jackson will direct a sequel. Hergé took pains to explore very different aspects of comic story-telling in different Tintin books, so every one of these sequels could stand own its own, like the better James Bond movies.<br/><br/>Tintin comes off as the same 'Everyman' seen in the books; a character almost anyone can smoothly identify with, and who made the reader feel 'hmmm, maybe I could do that, too.' No superheroes in sight, even though many of the adventures are pretty crazy.<br/><br/>The PG rating is spot on, with a few deaths off-screen and some blood, nothing the 8+ crowd cannot handle. As in any good adventure film viewable by children, the heroes Tintin and Haddock never kill anyone (even when it appears so for a moment), although they fight and shoot with abandon. As in any good adventure film viewable by adults, there are some interesting characters and some plot and visual ideas you probably have not seen in any other film before. Snowy (Tintin's trusted dog) in particular gets some of these going. He's his own little 'silent dog movie' built into the greater adventure. If you go to see it twice, just focus on Snowy, and you'll see what I mean.<br/><br/>The visuals are extraordinarily well done. Their character matches the comic strip from title sequence to final credits about as well as you could hope to match the inimitable Hergé. Serkis knows motion capture acting. The 3-D was never annoying (well, one gratuitous cane- swing excepted), and I am easily annoyed by 3-D.<br/><br/>It gets 'only' a 7/10 because the plot alternates a little too much between almost stalling at times (in the characterization scenes), then taking off too frenetically (in the plentiful and fanciful chase scenes); and because character development could have been a little better (but the comics don't do it in a single book, either...). I left the theater as a very satisfied moviegoer."
"griffolyon12","7","0","2","21 December 2011"," Phoned in Spielberg and John Williams
","Like a Saturday morning cartoon, The Adventures of Tintin is brisk entertainment that is easily digestible, with plenty of excitement and laughs. Director Steven Spielberg crafts a children's film about a young intrepid reporter, named Tintin, and his uber-smart dog, Snowy, working to unravel a mystery involving sunken treasure. Simple enough concept, and Spielberg rarely strays from it to delve deeper into the emotions of the characters and add anything beyond standard stock characters -- in particular Tintin and the villain, Sakharine. However, The Adventures of Tintin flies by at a nice pace, with just enough missing pieces to the mystery -- and some highly imaginative action sequences every few minutes -- to keep the audience from zonking out. Spielberg deserves huge props on the masterful staging of a sequence where two construction cranes battle, smashing into one another. They cross in midair like large sword blades, one piloted by Sakharine, and the other by Captain Haddock, Tintin's sidekick. The imagination on display here and the near flawless animation and motion capture work from WETA, make The Adventures of Tintin an enjoyable thrill ride. Even if there is a lack of suspense cause we are never given enough time to delve deeper into characters and develop any real emotional connection, The Adventures of Tintin is a theme park ride. Short and enjoyable, but the thrills will most likely be forgotten a short while later.<br/><br/>I give The Adventures of Tintin a 7 out of 10!"

","It was totally amazing how Spielberg and Jackson handled this movie. I've been a huge fan of Tintin for 40 years and I think they were completely faithful to Georges Remi and all of Tintin's fans.<br/><br/>This was a difficult nut to crack - there are millions of Tintin fans, each with their own concept of how this movie should have been made. I think they developed the characters and plot for both existing fans as well as new ones. Had they just followed the storyline of the books, it would have been too predictable for people like me who have read them over and over.<br/><br/>I have been looking forward to this movie for three years (as soon as I heard that Spielberg and Jackson were handling it, my already-high expectations tripled.) <br/><br/>Thank you Steven and Peter for another thoroughly entertaining movie that is (hopefully) going to turn into a popular syndicate of many more to come."

","I went ahead and saw the midnight premiere last night with a few friends of mine, and I was surprised to see only two other small groups there. The theater was basically empty. I guess I should have expected that however, seeing that this is based off of French comics that never really kicked off in the US. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I must say that this movie is now my 8th favorite movie of all time. The animation was absolutely breathtaking and photo-realistic. The animated reflection and refraction of society through magnifying glasses, bubbles, water, etc... was unbelievable! The story line might not have been brand new, but it was executed superbly. Spielberg was sure to strip the story to its bare frame and then add on his own layers of pure ingenious symbols, motifs, and unique conflicts. Every scene was brilliant. The best scene in the entire movie is a chase sequence towards the end. It is by far the greatest chase sequence I have ever seen in my life. Nothing compares to it at all. Although this was Spielberg's first animated film, animation was no difficult field for him to master. If I don't see a sequel to this movie in a couple of years, I'm going to be one unhappy camper. This movie will win at least an Oscar for best animation this coming year, and it's sure to take you to a whole new world and back. See it in theaters. See it in 3D. Don't regret those 16 dollars lost. And watch it again and again. This movie is what storytelling is all about."

","Every successful movie needs a singular heroine without flaws, and this has it (as do Spielberg's other teen masterpieces) in Caucasian spades -- especially in the case of South Asia.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg delivers another unborn out-of-wedlock baby yet again, only this time it happens to be a weird red-headed genderless child with a teenage lesbian haircut. Whilst waiting for the relentless picture to end, my partner's response to me was ""He stole your merkin and put on that kid's balding head! And he gave him your culo!"" After looking over myself in the mirror for a few days, I wholeheartedly agreed and concluded that she was right on the money. At least the money I had paid her to conjoin with me at the seedy motel post cinema.<br/><br/>Yes, we had a lesbian good time at the midnight show, enjoying the fluent English-speaking pooch, evil eagle, and rollicking with the cast and chain-smoking crew of Cutthroat Island.<br/><br/>If we hadn't been kissing and hugging and cavorting so much, I might have missed some critical moments, but as it happened, the movie was too distracting with all the CGI and whatnot.<br/><br/>I was shocked that my 3 year old almost-unborn baby had to be witness to all this violence, but then I thought of Sophie's children and understood how it might be that Hollywood Magic could pose a very real traumatic theme for youngsters of any age (much like Nim's Island).<br/><br/>I was eternally grateful that the film completely disregarded potentially important socio-cultural-economic issues in favour of petty thievery, Scooby-Doo deep investigative research, hooch swigging ship captains, shrill opera divas and the profitless trade in bootleg bottle art (an unintentional swipe at downloading).<br/><br/>And praise god that there were virtually no women in the film (in truth, there were two), although there were a few Ahab-the-Arabs. If real life can't change my gender, at least Steven Spielberg can, temporarily. But I do want my merkin back.<br/><br/>Bravo!"

I like how the characters have been rendered: as almost life-like but still comicky.<br/><br/>The only minus I have, is the excessive action scenes. The palace-escape scene was too long, and crazy.

"blackarrowpro","9","0","2","13 December 2011"," This movie was fantastic!
","This is the first review I have ever written, and I am writing it purely because I love this film.<br/><br/>1) The 3D aspect in this film was brilliant! It was subtle and compelling, without being unrealistic and in-you-face. While I was in the movie, I removed my glasses for a few seconds to check that it was actually in 3D, and I could see the faint blur around characters. What I found fantastic about the 3D aspect of this film was that it was so believable, that you actually forgot that what you were viewing was entirely computer-generated. Some films abuse 3D technology so much that you feel that you're floating in out-of-space, but Tin Tin was done to perfection.<br/><br/>2)The storyline was compelling and fun. I've read some ridiculous reviews so far about how Spielberg 'ruined' the storyline by making it boring, and mixing characters and elements from different Tin Tin comics. SO WHAT? Spielberg never said the film was going to be called ""Tin Tin: The Crab With The Golden Claws"". In that case, if he mixed several comics, then people should have a right to be annoyed. But this film was about Tin Tin in general, and it gave people an overall sense of adventures and characters from a whole span of comics. Isn't it better for Spielberg to include references from several Tin Tin comic books, than to just go off on a completely different tangent without no reference to the comics at all? If that were the case, many of the die-hard fans would say that the movie had nothing to do with the soul and character of the original comics. Some people are just so damn fickle... On a more positive note: the storyline is beautiful and engaging, whether you are a age-old Tin Tin fan or just a movie lover.<br/><br/>I work in the film and animation industry, and as such I should be predisposed to picking apart any film that arrives in the cinema. However, I can say with utmost confidence, that Tin Tin is the greatest film from 2011.<br/><br/>--------9/10--------<br/><br/>P.S. To the person who claims to be a Tin Tin 'expert' and says that Spielberg has it all wrong because Tin Tin actually has BLONDE hair - you're an idiot."

He goes on about an adventure trying to solve the puzzle, and meets Captain Archibald Haddock (Andy Serkis) through his journey. The rest of the story is about how they solve the mystery together, and discover the lost treasure of the Unicorn.<br/><br/>Though everything seemed to have worked really well for the movie, I somehow wasn't totally satisfied when it ended.

","Steven Spielberg's computer animated adventure about a young boy Tintin, his little white dog Snowy, and an endearingly drunken Captain Haddock might be too much of a good thing – but it's a good thing nonetheless.<br/><br/>The frantic action is non-stop: from the minute Tintin sees a model ship called THE UNICORN, he's dead set on buying it. But a few seedy characters want it for themselves and the daring young investigative reporter needs to find out why – all having to do with the lineage of the underdog alcoholic Captain, held hostage at sea by the main antagonist: a greedy yet cunningly classy villain named Sakharine, much like Belloq from Spielberg's RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, which this movie tries hard to emulate by wielding a constant handing-off of perilous escapades.<br/><br/>The problem is we don't get to know any of the characters enough (who'd be more interesting if they were actually human) to care about them, or take part emotionally in their quest: which is too hackneyed to sustain genuine interest, although the dialog sets up each situation well enough and there are a few semi-witty moments by two keystone cops. But the best scenes involve Haddock, voiced wonderfully by Andy Serkis, recalling his father's pirate ship battles: the imagery of the tale surrounding the scene as he talks. And the rambunctious Snowy merely provides a peripheral mascot to the action, yet he's a character worth loving for no other reason than being furry and cute.<br/><br/>As for Tintin, he's got a heart for adventure but why exactly? Well perhaps it doesn't matter If you want two hours of nothing but thrills, this will do it for you. And with the constantly moving camera gliding in, out, up and around like a ghost on pep pills, it feels more like producer Peter Jackson's baby than Spielberg's.<br/><br/>But it's the John Williams score, and the feeling of being young again, that gives the iconic director his signature throughout: too bad the last half, as the action goes overboard, is written in vanishing ink.<br/><br/>For More Reviews: www.cultfilmfreaks.com"

","OK, so here it is at last. Spielberg and Tintin united! How much better can it get? Being 21, I was introduced to Tintin by my father as a child, like any french-speaking kid in this world ought to be. I've loved Tintin for as long as I remember, and got pretty excited when I learned Spielberg and Jackson were behind this pearl of a movie. The question is now: does it live up to the expectations of millions? Absolutely! The Adventures of Tintin begins with a charming nod to Hergé, and quickly builds up speed. As the story unfolds, you will meet a cast of classic Tintin characters like the Dupond/ts, Captain Haddock, the Castafiore, Alan, and so on so forth. They all are very true to the comic, while also feeling uniquely human. Haddock is a highlight. The gruffy captain is never quite doing anything right, which is exactly why you'll like him. Snowy must be the most enticing dog ever caught on film (as to say) and I do believe he will be a standout for most viewers. After 2 hours, the story has this great open ending (when you know what will come next!) and you will swear you were not seated for more than 30 minutes.<br/><br/>While the some may be putt off by the photo-realistic animation (The abhorred uncanny valley) I was absolutely delighted by the look and feel of the characters and set pieces. They all look so very real, and at the same time so very cartoony, I couldn't ask for more. The action sequence are as grand as Spielberg and Jackson can be (The morocco chase and the Pirate battle are instant classics) and John Williams delivers as usual (although there is no definitive theme that will be remembered as ""That Tintin Song"").<br/><br/>All in all, I was delighted by this movie, and so were my friends. Go see it, go love it, and read the comic books if you are not familiar with them, they are excellent."

Plus there's something changed from the book is there's ever a part of captain broke a dam with a missile launcher ! Or is my memory is starting playing tricks on me?

I would highly recommend you to watch this movie in IMAX theater, it would double your joy if your place have IMAX, it's pity, that I didn't make it in IMAX, so I would buy blu-ray 3D when it release sometime after, it's really good, worth your time in theater absolutely!"

","Ever since I was a kid, I had been aware of this series of adventure- type cartoon books featuring this pale young boy with his short red hair flipped up in front named Tintin. But unusually though, unlike many in my generation, I have to confess that I have never read even one of them. When I heard that Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson had teamed up to create an animated version of Tintin, I knew this was the perfect time for me (and my family) to finally get to know this famous guy.<br/><br/>The story follows intrepid young reporter Tintin (Jamie Bell) when a model ship he bought for a pound from a street seller was being relentlessly pursued by a mysterious man named Sakharine (Daniel Craig). Along the way, Tintin crosses paths with the alcoholic Captain Haddock (the versatile Andy Serkis) who was apparently the heir of a huge fortune of gold lost at sea, the very fortune also being sought by Sakharine. This race for the treasure leads Tintin and the Captain in an unexpected adventure of the highest order that spans land, sea and air! This action-packed contest of wills was also laced with most biting and slyly funny Continental humor, mostly care of the bumbling Inspectors Thomson and Thompson.<br/><br/>This was simply one of the most visually stunning movies I have EVER seen. The colorful and entertaining title sequence itself already draws you in. The motion capture animation is stepped up 100% from past incarnations as ""Polar Express"" and ""Christmas Carol."" This movie is beautiful and exciting at the same time, with just the right hint of nostalgia. The artwork is flawless. The colors were vibrant. The action sequences were exhilarating. The realism of this animated film (Spielberg's first as director) was astounding. You will be impressed by the scenes showing Snowy (Tintin's cute dog), sunsets, the ocean, galleon ships, the airplane, the desert, the falcon, the shattering glass, the battling cranes, all rendered with palpable texture. And we only watched in 2D! Definitely a must-watch for the big screen! 10 stars!"

","Before I get into to actual review, I must confess to not being familiar with the comics by Herge that the film is based on. So if you ask me, ""How much did they right?"" or ""Were they true to the spirits of the comics?"" you're honestly asking the wrong guy.<br/><br/>The film follows investigative reporter, Tintin (Played by Jamie Bell), and his canine companion, Snowy. While at the market, Tintin comes across a model of a legendary ship known as the Unicorn. What he soon discovers is that the model is one of three identical models that contain a secret scroll within the mast, each of which is sought after by evil Ivan Sakharine (Played by Daniel Craig). The scrolls contain a mystery that can only be solved by Captain Archibald Haddock (Played by Andy Serkis), a descendant of Francis Haddock, the original captain of the ill fated Unicorn.<br/><br/>First of all, I give high praise to the sound, which is incredibly mixed and edited, and features one of the year's very best musical scores - courtesy of the great John Williams. Secondly, I have even higher praise for how the movie looks. The film showcases brisk, snappy editing, fascinating film noir camera work, and slightly cartoonish, but near photo realistic visual effects by Joe Letteri and his team from Weta Digital.<br/><br/>It would be really easy for me to get really excited about the movie... if only the concepts were as fine tuned as the aesthetics. I think Spielberg and his team seemed so intent to nail the styles and visual looks of the comics (Did they? I don't know) that they forgot to keep a more narrowed focus on the screenplay. Now it's not that I anything against the story. It's pretty decent stuff, aside from a somewhat useless sub plot with a pickpocket (Played by Toby Jones), and an abrupt, awkward ending that sets things up for a sequel.<br/><br/>My bigger issues lie with character. The movie features an abundance of two dimensional characters, with the only character getting any full, proper development being Captain Haddock. But let me just ask this. If the movie is called ""The Adventures of TINTIN"", why is our lead character so less interesting than a supporting character? <br/><br/>Oh well, at least I found myself delightfully distracted by some really clever action sequences. Such as a daring escape from a cargo ship, an epic clash between two manually operated construction cranes, and a thrilling high speed chase through Bagghar that I'd easily jot down as one of the year's best overall scenes. However, a few creative action sequences in an hour and forty five minute movie doesn't quite cut it for me.<br/><br/>My arguments still stand, but I also realize that I can't be too harsh on Tintin. It is what it is, an entertaining popcorn movie.<br/><br/>**1/2 out of ****"

","Some have described this movie as ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" with Tintin, but to me it doesn't really have the charm of something like the Indiana Jones movies. I don't know precisely what it is, maybe I just need my explosions to be in live action for them to work. The animation techniques used in this film are absolutely excellent, but when your writing is this mediocre the whole motion capture thing seems like nothing more than a gimmick. Speaking of useless gimmicks, what is up with the 3D-effects in this movie? Or rather, where are they? When you're forcing yourself to pay extra and watch an entire movie wearing those glasses nobody likes, you at least demand that there will be some things flying into your face. Forget it, unless you count subtitles. It's not all bad though. The actors for instance are very good, particularly Andy Serkis as Haddock. The movie also manages to strike the exact tone the comic books had, it's pretty faithful to the original and you can tell the makers love the source material. Furthermore, it can also be very witty sometimes, which is something you may not expect. Overall it's pretty entertaining and I had fun, ""Tintin"" is a decent popcorn flick without being anything special."

","With set design and even lighting to be added later, Steven Spielberg was as free wheeling in his direction as he almost was of the first 'Raiders of the Lost Ark'. 'Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' could certainly have done with the injection of air and deftness of touch that Spielberg applies to TinTin. The reason to see the film, however, is the performance of Captain Haddock by Andy Serkis - only slightly enhanced by a veneer created by the bank of CGI animators at WETA.<br/><br/>Serkis channels a range of influences, from Rab C Nesbitt, Billy Connolly, Sean Connery and even not a little Marcel Marceau in his Rabelaisian creation and it is fascinating to watch.<br/><br/>Eminently Oscar worthy - three times the charm, Academy!"

","Based on one of my favorite childhood comic books, comes one of the best ever animation motion pictures of this year. The Adventures of Tintin (2011) does a fine job in keeping the audience entertained while compromising a bit on the original story line.<br/><br/>Plot: The Secret of the Unicorn is not the first book in the Adventures of Tintin and neither was the character of Captain Haddock introduced in this book. But I am not complaining <br/><br/>The plot kicks off right from scene one where Tintin unsuspectingly buys a three-masted sailing ship. The floor is immediately set for an adventurous journey. Far too many people seem interested in buying the replica model which sets the young man thinking, that it may hold secrets to something very important.<br/><br/>An attempted murder, a car chase and a burglary later he is proved right. Only that the perpetrators of the crimes failed in their desperate attempt to get what they wanted – a piece of parchment hidden in the replica.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we are introduced to the twins from the police force – Thomson and Thompson, who are in search of a notorious pick-pocket. They do manage to lay their hands on their target using an ingenious technique only to let him slip away (as you would expect from these comical characters)!<br/><br/>As soon as Tintin gets back home he is kidnapped. The rest of the story revolves around the journalist trying to escape from his captors, the introduction of Captain Haddock, the story behind the Unicorn and the secret treasure that lays at the bottom of the ocean floor. The hunt is on now in earnest.<br/><br/>Special Effects: I watched the film in 3D and, to say the least, I was blown away – not by the 3D effects but rather by the Performance Capture technology. It was scintillating to see the visuals. It was hard to believe the world I saw on the big screen was virtual. The audio effects adds up to the amazing graphics and sets the mood for a fantastic adventure ride.<br/><br/>Be it the noise of pencil scribbling on paper or the pumped up car chases with everything getting blown away, every sound and frame stand out as perfect. This is definitely one of the best visual treats and, needless to say, was a pleasure to watch!<br/><br/>Cast and Performance: Any avid Tintin fan would stand up and applaud the choice for the cast. It was perfect in my opinion. Everything from their voice to their demeanor matched my imagination. It was as if the characters of Hergé had magically come to life! Definitely two thumbs up for the cast.<br/><br/>It would be interesting to lookout for the casting in the sequel(s) (hoping there are many more to come). Surely, interests for doing voice overs in this series will spike; its about to get crowded with the best in the business eager to pitch in somewhere.<br/><br/>Though being an animated film, I would still go ahead with the performance section of my review. Because you realize, while watching this film, that this is simply NOT cartoons on canvas – anything but that!<br/><br/>Jamie Bell as Tintin, Daniel Craig as Ivan Ivanovitch Sakharine, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost as Thomson and Thompson all shine through quite easily and have been poignant in the rendition of their fictional characters. The others are not far behind by any means. The characters of lesser importance in the plot of the film, too, walk away with acknowledgment of a job well done.<br/><br/>But even out of this great cast, I am inclined to pick Andy Serkis rendering of the character of Haddock as the best. One will end up being mesmerized by the perfection that has gone to recreate THE most animated character in this comic book series.<br/><br/>Direction: You have moments of adventure, that of good humor (there are way too many characters to take care of this) and thankfully no drama. The film rolls on without any noticeable flaws. The performance extracted out of the characters, as I already mentioned, only add to the positives.<br/><br/>An average Tintin fan would expect nothing short of brilliance in direction.

","Tintin - Summer of 1996 was the first time I was introduced to Tintin comics by my dad.It was a second hand copy of ""The broken ear"", the 6th in the series of 25 comics. I was immediately sucked into the world of beautiful and quirky characters, witty dialogues & the adventures. 15 years hence, I went to the theater, unsure, but waiting to be wowed by Spielberg (his first animation film).<br/><br/>And boy, what fun it turned out to be. He comes up with a thoroughly nuanced, brilliantly shot and beautifully captured film that is so lifelike that you can almost feel the characters skin.<br/><br/>Die-hard fans of Tintin may not find the movie to be as emotionally engaging as the books, but its an excellent endeavor nonetheless. Spielberg's Tintin is unlike Herge's (the creator of Tintin). Though he is true to the spirit of the comics, he is shown to be a daredevil in the movie.<br/><br/>Mr. Spielberg gives us a great hero (or should I say side-kick) in Captain Haddock, who towers over tintin in most of the frames. The ever drunk, angry, spewing captain has some of the best lines in the film. He even makes him breathe fuel into a plane (sorry for the spoilers) in one of the films many chase sequences involving bikes, cars, planes and , hell, ships. Then there is snowy, who has a huge role in the movie. Snowy , the only CGI character in the films manages to hold ground of its own.<br/><br/>The passion to bring one the world's greatest comic characters alive on screen shows as Spielberg, who acquired rights of the movie way back in 1984, has remained as true as possible to the comics. He tells a classic tale of mystery, involving clues, quirky characters without any gadgets & gizmos. It has such an ""old world"" charm to it. This movie is an excellent endeavor to make the movie as emotionally engaging as possible.<br/><br/>I really could not find a proper term to define my astonishment when my eyes approached the beautiful places and landscapes shown in the movie. They look perfect, shining and bursting with emotions, sensations; they almost look like paintings: For instance, there's a sunset in the movie that I will hardly forget. It's the same with the CGI models: you can see the wrinkles on the character's faces, even their sweat.<br/><br/>Spielberg has truly gone off his way to make use for the technology. Action scenes are shot with a long single shot, where the camera goes around to wild angles. There's a strong sense of being in on the action and forgetting you even are wearing a pair of painful glasses. The film takes a while to pick off steam at first, but after that the action varies from pirate battles to crane fights. The most outstanding scene is the motorcycle chase near the end, which would give Indiana Jones a run for his money.<br/><br/>The film ends with the promise of a sequel (to be directed by ""lord of the rings"" fame, Peter Jackson) And boy, oh boy, I'am excited.<br/><br/>But for now, I shall be going back to the comics. Gonna be a long night, after a long time.<br/><br/>Shrini"

","Thanks to Spielberg who could so well carry it with his amazing technique of motion capturing rather action capturing where he moves the camera along with the protagonist on the screen. Beautifully manifested Tintin couldn't have received a warmer welcome to the film industry.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of Tintin comics and of course the animated series as well, especially the unrelenting Captain Haddock and who could forget the amazing duos Thompson and Thomson with their clumsy behavior who always managed to giggle me every now and then. Tintin and Snowy however used to be my heroes solving mysteries and defying danger at every step. When I found out that there was going to be a movie and none other than Steven Spielberg was gonna direct it, I was more than elated. <br/><br/>A perfect 3D fest right from the inception of the movie till the end, the movie has taken CGI to the next level with Spielberg's classic method of action capturing and boy I must say I was amazed as I kept on pointing how beautiful the effects appeared with every scene. Everything seemed so real, right from their countenances to the environment – the beautiful sea, the vast desert and every tiny detail. The story took us to one hell of a ride with Tintin solving the mystery and connecting the dots for us. Captain Haddock had never been portrayed that brilliantly, keeping in mind every tiny details and facial expressions. Snowy appeared ditto as it used to be in the cartoons and equally cute too. <br/><br/>Tintin, superbly portrayed by Jamie Bell, finds a Unicorn ship in the market and buys it only to encounter hell himself in the form of Sakharine (Daniel Craig) who is keen to get the ship for there is something in the ship that interests him. Tintin finds himself in trouble as Sakharine is hell-bent on getting the ship from the hands of the lad. Tintin however smells the foul play and since then takes us on a joy ride connecting the pieces together with the assistance of Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis – A perfect choice for the role .. He has gone so much better .. Andy Serkis for president !) who has been kidnapped by Sakharine.<br/><br/>The movie gives you a unique experience of 3D and motion capturing which I think is a must watch. Steven knows how to impeccably exploit technology. Go watch this one if you want to witness awesomeness in 3D."

","I felt so lucky to watch Tin Tin before the American fans and China's related department finally agreed to release it in China mainland.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, Tin Tin is a wonderful movie, with a complete story of adventure, attractive characters, appropriate humor and exotic scenery. The CG tech helped create so many beautiful scenes of chasing, exploding, fighting. However, i suggest that the movie is so exquisite that there are so many fine details on the screen will hardly be notice by most audiences. <br/><br/>The spirit of this movie seems common, but still there is a gap between western and orient suspicious stories.

","I am a fan of the animation movies. I believe that a story can be narrated so much better in an animation movie. Hence, when I saw that this was a classic character and a legendary director, I guess I set myself up for a lot more than what eventually got offered in this movie. The technology aspect of the movie is definitely impressive with effect of reality created being very high. However, I was a tad disappointed by the actual delivery of the movie. The narration is not crisp and felt a bit drag. The movie almost undermines the smartness of its audience (kids included). Also, at 107 minutes the movie is probably 15 minutes too long. The biggest failing point of the movie in my mind is that the crescendo moment of the movie happened at about 75% point in the movie and then the story just eases to an end rather than ending at a high point. All and all, the movie left me asking for more at the end of it without leaving an impression on my mind as such."

","Puritans will see flaws and see no need to combine the stories of 3 comics. But a book by book adaptation of the original comics would just be boring to people unfamiliar with Tintin. So fanboys aside, this is the must-see picture of the year. Action packed, funny and like a roller-coaster ride that ends too soon. As always Andy Serkis steals the show. Man this actor should be honored for his entire body of work that only seems to get better. Who doesn't remember Gollum from the LOTR (in all the parodies, homages etc. his precious is never overlooked), the very believable chimp Ceasar from Rise of the planets of the Apes, which many of my friends and family thought was a trained ape and now the absolutely stunning show-stopping performance as Captain Haddock.

","Tintin is an intrepid young newspaper reporter. When he accidentally comes into possession of one third of a treasure map, he and his trusty dog Snowy are thrown into a crazy adventure with a mad drunken sea-dog called Captain Haddock, in search of a legendary lost galleon ...<br/><br/>Spielberg's big-screen adaptation of the classic Belgian comic-books by Hergé/Georges Remi is a fabulous, visually dazzling, good old-fashioned family adventure story, which is both a terrific action film and a beautifully loving tribute to the comics which inspired it. Shot with live-action actors doing mo-cap and then completely CG reanimated (like Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf), it has all the stylish artistry of a comic, complete with bent noses, beady eyes and goofy clothes, but super-smooth animation through the frame. The movie is also masterfully edited by Spielberg's longtime cutter Michael Kahn - rather than chopping all the action scenes up, they are gloriously free form as our heroes rush across traffic-filled streets and the camera swoops and pans all around them. There is a sequence with Tintin on a motorbike chasing the villains through an Arabic town which is one of the most dazzling and dynamic scenes I've ever come across, and makes incredible use of the state-of-the-art animation technology. It's also a story with great values - I have two sons under the age of ten and the tone of this movie is perfect for them - full of action, mystery and comedy, but never gratuitous or offensive. The scene where Tintin and Snowy try to retrieve the keys from the bunkhouse is one of many hilarious highlights, and there are oodles of great fights, notably the flashback sea-battle with the pirates. Heroes are honest and true, villains are devious and scheming, and no time is wasted moralising or being sentimental. The cast are great, the key player being Serkis' crazy broad-brogued sot Haddock, who lurches from scene to scene permanently furious, self-pitying, gung-ho and sozzled, often all at the same time. Bell is terrific in the straight-ahead lead, never slipping into a tongue-in-cheek caricature, and also the only actor who actually looks like his on-screen character. Craig enjoys himself as the snarling villain Sakharine, as do comic partners Pegg and Frost (Shaun Of The Dead, Hot Fuzz, Paul) as the goofy Thomson and Thompson. I love the child-like quality of much of Spielberg's work - he has somehow never lost the giddy thrill of excitement he felt when he first discovered these stories and has transplanted that sense into this expertly crafted film. Written by Steven Moffatt, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish, based on three original Hergé stories, and produced by Peter Jackson. Cracking fun all round."

"xamtaro","Null","0","3","17 November 2011"," Not a straight out adaptation, but The ultimate homage to a much loved comic series
","Come on, admit it, if your first English comic was not Archie or Asterix, it most likely was TINTIN. The world spanning adventures of an intrepid young reporter as he takes meets unique people, unearths ancient secrets, brings corrupt businessmen to justice, travels to exotic lands and do what imaginative children can only dream about. Each book was a whole new genre including some that touched on horror and science fiction. Steven Spielberg's computer animated ""The Adventures of TinTin"" combines two books' story lines, and throws in some minor tweaks for coherence, but manages to stay true to the spirit of what made the original stories such a good read.<br/><br/>Purists would no doubt condemn the condensing of two stories, ""The Secret of The Unicorn"" and ""The Crab With the Golden Claws"", into a single movie. Why go through the trouble and change the story? Because, to be honest, adapting only a single story would not do justice to TinTin as a whole. The Secret Of the Unicorn is essentially a mystery tale like something out of Sherlock Holmes. No big action pieces, no worldwide adventure, no exotic locales. While the condensation of stories is jarring for those familiar with the originals, it is done in such a coherent manner that it seems like a single proper story.<br/><br/>Famous reporter TinTin stumbles upon a mysterious model of an ancient ship, The Unicorn, which lands him in the biggest case of his life involving a long lost pirate's loot, a clandestine plot to steal a royal treasure and an unresolved family feud. Along the way he meets Captain Haddock, a washed up ship captain with a drinking problem, who might hold the key to the mystery. If only he could stay sober long enough to remember.<br/><br/>Everyone is exactly how one remembers them either from the comic or the classic cartoons. The bumbling Thomson/Thompson twins, Captain Haddock's comical rage, TinTin's inquisitive nature, it is all there. Nostalgia is the order of the day as the film takes us back to a simpler time of childhood. The character chemistry, adrenaline charged chases and light hearted dialogue call to mind swashbuckling pulp novel adventures in the vein of Indiana Jones. Sadly, the flaws of the original comic are all there too. The film is so plot driven that little attention is given to character development. Like the comic, there may be one too many convenient turn of events.<br/><br/>Before you are turned away by the seemingly simplistic narrative, it will be the animation itself that would grab you back. Final Fantasy is yesterday's news compared to the animation in The Adventures of TinTin. Yes, they may have ""cheated"" by using motion capture, but the results are magnificent. Everything moves like how they do in real life; vehicles have a sense of mass, there is visible inertia in moving objects, and characters move like actual people. The stunning level of detail, right down to the pores on characters' skin and individual hair follicles, is coupled with designs very similar to the cartoony art of the comics.<br/><br/>Try thinking of Spielberg's ""The Adventures Of TinTin"" less of an adaptation of the comics but more of a homage to the entire franchise. The whole movie is littered with dozens of allusions and shout outs to other stories in the series. Fans would have a field day recognising all the Easter eggs and cameos. After a slow start, the show really picks up and never lets up; well written dialogue, excellent cast chemistry and timely humor providing endless entertainment. Whether you are a child endlessly pouring through TinTin comics in the library, or an ""ex-child"" who followed the cartoon on weekday evenings, The Adventures of TinTin is pure fun and a great way to see your favorite characters come alive.<br/><br/>http://thexamtaroshowvault.blogspot.com/"
"vikram-ry123","7","0","3","16 November 2011"," My Belgian Friend, Tintin!
","Last Sunday, sister 28, brother-in-law 32 and me 24; three of us all adults went to watch the latest Spielberg film ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"", we put some extra-large glasses in our eyes; the experience to watch a WETA digital animated motion picture technology in 3D is superb. John Williams' sound composition for the motion picture purpose is awesome.<br/><br/>Tintin is a legendary detective and journalist boy character by Herge. I was a kid, only 3, my sister and neighbor sister Lucy, both were 6 and they were good playmates. Lucy was my first love to introduce and love Tintin. Her father has two children, both are beautiful girls and every year they go to Calcutta international Book Fair, they bought TINTINs. It was in 1989; I was first introduced with the Belgian friend, ""The Calculus Affair"" or ""Calculus Er Kando"" – in Bengali is the first face-to-face introduction with all the evergreen characters from the history of creation.<br/><br/>In those days I was too little to understand the heavy ideas that Herge put into those large glossy papers. I like Tintin, his looks; Captain Archibald Haddock, ""Billions of blue blistering barnacles!""; Thomson and Thompson, their foolish intelligence and the smartest little ""Snowy"" or ""Kuttus"" is better known to me. I draw several poses and still keep those paintings with care. ""Tintin in Tibet"" was my first self-collection, that I saved from daily tiffin money in the school days to buy one by one in every month, it last only up to 6 of the books. Then a partnership collection with my classmate Arunava Roy, we pay half and half to read the complete series. ""Tintin and the Lake of Sharks"", was the last book we bought together.<br/><br/>I always look for the cheapest collection of Tintin and it was ""Anandomela"" – a leading teenage monthly in Bengal. They publish in two or three bunch edition in their magazines. I unpin those pages and set them into one single comic book edition. It was a huge part of my collection too. ‎ Dibyendu Nandi, my neighbor brother, he has the book ""The Castafiore Emerald"" (""Panna Kothai"" – in Bengali) I took it and didn't returned him for several months, finally he asked for the branch. I was intentionally waiting for his forgetfulness to grow up my collections but the trick didn't worked. The last book I read when I was 17, ""In the Land of the Soviets""; it takes time because it was the costliest of the whole series.<br/><br/>Recently, it was an exciting conversation with Premjit Nath, on 13 November at 14:38<br/><br/>Me: Yesterday I see both ""The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn"" and ""Immortals"" in 3D and my suggestion, attend them only in 3D the experience, just unforgettable!<br/><br/>Premjit Nath: If pocket allows only one; then which one?<br/><br/>Me: ‎Premjit da, Tintin TinTin I grow up enjoying this character so much, and Spielberg always fulfills the huge expectations of entertainment. Lots of unforgettable memories and emotions related with our Belgium friend Can't betray ""Tintin""! <br/><br/>Premjit Nath: Agreed can't betray our childhood friend.<br/><br/>About the film; people around the world read Tintin is well known about The Adventure of the Unicorn. So nothing to say special. And who didn't know Tintin, I am keeping the story in secret to watch and invent the adventures themselves."
"ryokan_wc","7","0","2","16 November 2011"," As its title suggests: Adventure!
","As the title suggests, i was prepared to join Tintin in a ride of adventure.<br/><br/>Voiced by Jamie Bell as Tintin, he bought a model ship which hid clues that ultimately forced him into a feud between two families (Haddock voiced by Andy S and Sakharine voiced by Daniel C) in search for the hidden treasure. Tintin with his adorable pet Snowy, investigated the mystery surrounding them, deciphering the clues along the way and met Haddock after his kidnap by Sakharine. They escaped and raced against time and Sakharine to retrieve all three pieces of the puzzle. In the start, it felt like an animated Sherlock Holmes with Snowy playing Watson. When they boarded the ship, it felt like Narnia 3: Voyage of the Dawn Treader and when Haddock recalled the story his grandfather told him, the scenes pictured that of Pirates of the Caribbean. Not that it wasn't good or original, but just that the scenes felt familiar.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the graphic and visual of the movie. The faces of the characters looked so real i had to remind myself that it was an animation. One of my favourite scenes in the movie was when Tintin and his gang were in Morocco and they were running away, at the same time snatching the scrolls, from Sakharine's men and bird. It flowed well with fast-paced action and humour. Another scene that captured my attention was the fight between Haddock and Sakharine using cranes. It was intense yet entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>How could an animation movie like this go wrong? It doesn't. It is a progressive story with mystery intertwined that blends well action with adventure, humour with intensity. Good visual and adorable characters. I was dumbfounded that Tintin was not a kid and what i thought to be a childish movie had the characters holding guns. I was wrong, but i was, to say the least, pleased. The adventures of Tintin gets a green light!"

This movie is also filled with very genuine humor which I think along with action scenes are the movie's biggest strength.Captain Haddock and snowy are very funny and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>I watched the movie in IMAX 3D, But If you view this in 2D you wont miss much, as there isn't much 3D effect except for some scenes.The motion-capture used for the movie is very photo realistic and you can even see the sweat clearly on the face of Captain Haddock in one particular scene.The animation quality is top notch and all the characters look very convincing and real, even though they are modeled after their comic book counterparts.Now I see why Jackson said that the film will look ""film noirish, very atmospheric"". Spielberg acquired rights for the movie 1983 and in 2011 he has gone all-out to leave no stone unturned. <br/><br/>So to ramp it up, Positive points about this movies are Action Scenes, Humor , Great Animation quality (Both the characters and the atmosphere). Only negative point would be the plot-line which Hardcore Purists fans of comics may not like.This is the only thing that may push it back from the great status to good.But for me Its a great film as a Jackson and Spielberg union movie should be and should definitely be watched in the theater.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to see the next sequel with Peter Jackson as its co-director."

This film has a lot of stand out moments which you would normally expect in a live action adventure film. Also a technical point, the editing was so different and unique.

","I've been a Tintin fan (got all the books) since I was ten years old (or thereabouts), so I was pleasantly surprised when the movie was announced. Considering that some previous attempts to put Tintin on the big screen had been underwhelming (the 1964 live action ""Tintin and the Blue Oranges"", or the animated ""Tintin and the Lake of Sharks"", 1972), I was a bit wary, considering that the script is a mash of three books. Watching the movie, I was pleased to see the cameo (of sorts) by Hergé (the cartoonist in the market), and the realism of the settings was quite amazing. I had several moments where I asked myself whether a scene was entirely CGI, or consisting of real environments and objects with the characters added in. But the photo-realism was a bit of a problem when it came to the characters. Whereas the comics work because they are obviously drawn, the realistic textures (down to Haddock's nose hairs) clashed with the exaggerated facial features. Many characters looked pretty grotesque, with big noses and all that. As for the story, it worked within the movie, and there were many faithful scenes, but the over-the-top action wasn't in the tradition of the comics all that often. Being loud, with lots of action and fast cuts, makes it more Hollywood than the comics (which might explain why Tintin didn't really make a hit in the US - he's too European). With the promise of a sequel, I hope that Spielberg will tone down the action a notch or two, and let the story speak for itself."

An excellent insinuation into the Herge's world with spectacular characterization and drastic dramatic changes into the plot, Spielberg creates yet another masterpiece and an instant timeless classic. Similar to Feluda's Jatayu, Tintin's Haddock creates an immaculate comic timing and magnificently crafted suspense which stays true to the lively spirit and ample humor of Herge's volumes. Pleasurable, idyllic and something that adheres to your mind like that of the taste of chocolate to your mouth, Spielberg caters us with an all-in-all common adventure-comedy whizz like that of the Indiana Jones genre......

At times, you'll really believe you are watching a real person rather than an imaginary one. The script was well written so it does not matter if you do not follow the series or know the characters because as the film progresses, you will slowly learn of them.<br/><br/>Finally, the success or failure of any animation depends on the voices behind the various characters. Amongst this talent pool of voices, the absolute standout performance for me must be Daniel Craig. He delivered the correct level of charm and menace in his vocal delivery as the chief villain. It was as if he studied all the villains from the Bond archive and reproduced it here. An excellent performance indeed.<br/><br/>So I am awarding this film full marks."

","I loved the movie and i give it 8 out of 10 stars. Why not 10 if you loved it? you may ask. Well, the beginning is a little boring but, for my astonishment, the break came out so fast! The plot is amazing and there are so many action parts that you don't have enough time to assimilate all. The big screen adaptation is very well made and the fans of Tintin will love it because it shows how smart, ambitious and curious Tintin is. Just like every other Steven Spielberg movie, the realization was amazing. The transition between scenes was very nice (like when Tintin shakes hand with Haddock) and the special effects to! My favorite special effects part is when Haddock and Tint are in the desert and the ship and the water appear. The lightning part is also very well done. The places were fantastic. The Bagghar Port is wonderful, the city where he lives (Paris, London? i don't know).. I recommend this movie if you want to spend a afternoon with family or if you're just a Tintin fan or if you just want to see a good movie... :)"

","For those who read Infinite Jest, the future seems (as Einstein also said) coming to us sooner than we think: with this installment the gap between real and animation has yet again been made smaller. But this movie is not only great in CGI. After all, the core will always remain the story, and atmosphere and this has also been handled with the greatest care. I was familiar with this best story of Tin Tin since the 70s and I never thought I would see it come alive so much as in this masterpiece. It is indeed a cross between Indiana Jones and the cartoon atmosphere of the Herge original; a nice treasure hunt in a romantic setting (detective film noir like city scenes, desert scenes in Marocco, airplaines, pirates, chasing scenes, humor, emotion, it is all there). It watched it in 3D and I must say this is the future too - it all comes so much more to life in comparison to 2D. This is simply a must to see 3D in theatres - go while you can!"

","Let's be honest here, Spielberg's Indy 4 was flat, CG heavy and, well, just plain stupid. It was the biggest disappointment since The Phantom Menace. However, with the help of Motion capture and a superb John Williams score, the director has finally got his mojo back. Tintin starts at breakneck speed, flowing seamlessly from scene to scene,the pace only lagging at the poorly written Thompson and Thomson scenes. You can tell that Spielberg is loving the freedom of Mo cap tech, giving him unrivalled visual freedom, delivering a stunningly beautiful adventure. Tintin is a likable and straightforward, whilst Snowy the dog and Andy Serkis's scene stealing Captain Haddock provide welcome comic relief and charm. Elsewhere, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost fail to breathe life into Thompson and Thomson, mainly due to the childish and unfunny jokes they are given and Daniel Craig makes for a reliable, if unspectacular villain. Then to the action. Stylishly choreographed and thrilling, Tintin's action rivals that of the Indy trilogy, in terms of white knuckle, relentless thrills. The Adventures of Tintin is Steven Spielberg's true Indy trilogy successor."
"the_rattlesnake25","6","0","2","10 November 2011"," It doesn't allow you a second to breathe...
","Recently Steven Spielberg has been one busy man, not only has he been producing numerous television and film properties over the past year or so, but he has also been juggling two directorial properties. While 'War Horse' isn't due to be released for another month, his latest offering, 'The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn,' is based on the classic, best-selling comic books created by the Belgian artist Georges Remi (who was also known under the pen name Herge). The comics follow a young Belgian reporter named Tintin and his dog Snowy as they go about their days solving mysteries and getting into various misadventures along the way. Directed by Spielberg, produced by Peter Jackson and written by the British trio of Edgar Wright, Joe Cornish and Steven Moffat, it marks a new turn in Spielberg's cinematic journey as he ditches live action for motion capture, and while the film takes full advantage of the technology at hand to create lavish environments, the story itself is too disorientating to hold an adult audiences attention for its one hour and forty minutes running time.<br/><br/>Tintin (Jamie Bell) along with his faithful dog Snowy, is enjoying his day meandering around a local market when he finds an intricately designed model ship called the Unicorn available for sale by a somewhat anxious merchant. Once in Tintin's possession, the ship sets off a sequence of events which sees the young reporter come up against the mysterious Ivanovich Sakharine (Daniel Craig), befriend the alcohol loving Captain Haddock (Andy Serkis), and help the bumbling Interpol agents Thomson and Thompson (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) in their many endeavours, as he attempts to unravel the mystery behind the legend of the Unicorn and the secret cargo stowed away by the ships fabled Captain Sir Francis Haddock. Action, adventure, explosions, and bumbling detectives follow as Tintin races throughout the world to solve the mystery of the Unicorn.<br/><br/>It is a phrase which is thrown around a lot when evaluating films within the action-adventure genre, but 'The Adventures of Tintin' is literally a non-stop thrill ride. But, while this phrase would usually be attributed to the praise of a motion picture, in the context of this film, it becomes a part of the criticism. From the beautifully crafted opening titles to the closing scene, there isn't a moment which goes by in which something isn't being blown up, jumped on, ridden or used as a makeshift weapon. It is as if Spielberg doesn't trust the primarily young audience members to actually engage with the film when a lavish action set-piece isn't taking place, and because of this, the audience is presented with a film which becomes disorientating due to its constant fast and frenetic pace. Also, due to the narratives exhilarating pace, the film requires that many of the large set-pieces take place one after the over, thereby once again detracting heavily away from their overall impact on the viewer.<br/><br/>Aside from the fast-paced nature of the motion-picture however, the performance capture works well, as the computer generated backgrounds, locations and scenery are a startling indicator of how far technology regarding motion capture and three-dimensional imagery has come in the last decade. When it comes to the characters themselves however, while the motion capture allows for startling facial detail, it cannot replicate the emotional disparity of real human beings. The script written by three of the most promising British filmmakers at the moment contains a multitude of in-jokes, friendly humour and an attempt at characterisation. But again due to the pace of the film, this aspect falls flat due to the central narrative stream taking precedence over everything else on-screen throughout its running time.<br/><br/>'The Adventures of Tintin' is a family-friendly, fast-paced, loose, action-adventure film that will no doubt be lauded by children across the land. It is essentially Spielberg doing what Spielberg does best: entertaining the public. But unlike the 'Indiana Jones' series and 'E.T,' among many of his other films, 'Tintin' is unable to cross generational boundaries to become a film for all the ages. While children will appreciate the non-stop, in-your-face action sequences which are constantly loud, bright and full of computer-generated destruction, older cinema-goers will no doubt become tired of the repetitive series of events. With a 'Tintin' sequel and even a trilogy potentially on the cards for the future, it would have been nice if Spielberg had attempted to scale back the action sequences for further plot and character development, rather than throwing every available device at the viewer hoping that something would eventually stick. While this approach may work with young children viewing the picture, it will almost certainly pass most adults by."

","Tintin! A classic comic which, I have not seen before. But although I am one generation behind, it is still so well known that I'm sure everyone has heard of it. After knowing that the movie animation is coming out, with two extremely big names as the movie's producer and director (as we know, they are Steven Spielberg and Peter Jackson), I know it is one movie I wouldn't miss.<br/><br/>And What more can I say, produced by two of the greatest movie makers of our days, ""The Adventures of Tintin"" was very well done. The graphic was really good and the story was very original, reminds me of how comic book adventure stories were supposed to be like. It didn't need to be overdone, just a nice animation telling a story the way a comic book story should be told, and suitable for audience of all ages!<br/><br/>I would really like to watch the Behind the Scenes too, as I know there was a huge amount of hard work involved. The movie was done by Motion Capture, just like ""King Kong"" and ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"". But unlike these two movies, Tintin was a full animation and MoCap was done throughout the movie. Which means the actors have to act through the story as well. Imagine how much precision had to be achieved with the actions to flow along with the story. I have watched parts of it in YouTube and it was impressive! Well done Weta Studio!<br/><br/>I have been watching the trailer again and again admiring the animation work. And I know I could easily watch the whole movie again too! And Thanks to Mr Spielberg and Mr Jackson, The Adventures of Tintin books must be selling hot again. I have two books myself now :). I realized Snowy the dog in the comic book actually talks. But I think it is a wise choice to not make the one in the movie talk. Cannot wait to start the book now.

","Ooooohhhh, what a movie, what an adventure, what a.... I can't... I'm lost for words !! How to describe the experience that is Tintin?? Even the opening credits will have you locked at the screen and it holds you there until the ending.<br/><br/>So we have Tintin, a young reporter, that comes across a model of an old ship: The Unicorn. And so the adventure begins. There are a lot of action scenes that are really fast paced, but just when you think: It's getting too much, they slow down and you can rest for a while. <br/><br/>If you've read the comic books, it helps of course as you remember a lot of things of your childhood. I advise everyone of you to read these comics and go see the movie, you won't regret. Best 10$ I've spend in ages.<br/><br/>Major props to Andy Serkis, who plays Captain Haddock perfectly. Jamie Bell as Tintin is also very good, but I'd have to give it to Steven and Peter for creating this epic, and hopefully successful franchise.<br/><br/>PS.: Try to avoid the 3D version... I didn't have any choice and although it was the best 3D experience yet, I still don't like the format. Stupid glasses and you get tired after 45 minutes...<br/><br/>Best regards, Raf"
"Rasa","7","0","3","7 November 2011"," Awesome technically, faithful to the comic books, but horrible soundtrack
","Fantastic story telling, quite faithful to the comic books. Technically a milestone in animation/motion capture. The things you will see here is unbelievable ! Unfortunately I am very auditive, and a good soundtrack can turn a bad movie into a good one for me, and a good movie into a bad one.. Unfortunately the last is the case here. I find John Williams' score here all to chaotic, and its not giving any depth to the scenes nor characters. I kind of liked the jazzy part with the intro sequence, but for the action scenes especially it gets really horrible. And a nice catching theme for Tintin would have been really nice.<br/><br/>But if you are not so auditive as me, I can only recommend it. And for all technically interested: Go and enjoy the state of the art of animation / motion capture."
"magical_boy1412","8","0","5","6 November 2011"," One of the Best 3D Movie in the Market
","First of all, the movie's graphic is awesome.<br/><br/>I don't study in this field, but seriously, watching it in the cinema in 3D gives me a brand new kind of experience. This 3D experience is quite different compared with other movies in the market - it's better. According to my uncle who works in this field, he said that the graphical quality of this movie is one of the best he has ever seen in his life! Besides that, the fast- paced story line and the actions also give you a kind of excitement throughout the 1 hour 48 minutes movie. Even though the story line is pretty normal for an adventure film, but the way Steven Spielburg tells the story is awesome - the flow is smooth and you never get bored at any point in the movie. What's more, Steven Spielburg has added some suspense element into the movie too - it blends in very well and makes the whole movie much more exciting. Oh, there are some humor elements in the movie too - which makes the film much more interesting and I did have quite some laughs in the cinema while watching it.<br/><br/>The opening credit of the movie is awesome too. I purposely write it in another paragraph because the way it's done is really impressive. During the credits, we can actually see a summary (in video, not words) of the whole story being told there. However, this summary doesn't contain any spoiler in it, but it does imply how ordinary the plot will be as a typical adventure film.<br/><br/>The only flaw in the movie is probably the ending part - it kinda ends out of sudden and makes me feel a little bit empty there, because I was expecting something else to happen there. However, from the way it's shown, it's possible that there'll be a sequel to this movie. And I'm really looking forward to it.<br/><br/>In short, a movie definitely worth a watch."

","I saw Tintin tonight, being very skeptical as someone for whom the Tintin comic strips have been a significant part of my childhood readings. Well, after spending 10 years not going back to the originals, that movie struck me as a faithful yet entertaining take on Hergé's legacy. Kudos to Steven Spielberg for remaining faithful to the original aesthetics and yet succeeding at shining at what he does best: making entertaining rememberable movies. Some Europeans (and especially Belgians) might criticise the process of Hollywood ""stealing"" European culture, but, as an European (and Belgian) who grew up in Hergé's work, I can only disagree and admire this impressive and entertaining, yet faithful adaptation."

I wanted my memories to be better than Hollywoods vision of a great European Comic Book Hero. (Alas I was to grow up really quickly)<br/><br/>This movie is a must see. I would defy anyone not to find something enjoyable about it. This actually took me to a different place and the beauty of the animation did more for me than Avatar managed to do.

","I saw ""The Adventures of Tintin"" this weekend and was gladly surprised how well this movie works. As a kid I read almost all Tintin Stories and watched the cartoons. I loved the exciting adventures that brought Tintin and his fellows all over the globe.<br/><br/>Now this Spielberg directed flick offers a great interpretation of Hergé's comicbook. It's almost like watching an Indiana Jones Movie. And I have to say that ""Tintin"" contains the elements I missed in ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". It has great memorable characters (ex. the constantly drunk Haddock), wonderful humour and a stupendous spectacular motorcycle chase through the city of bagghar. I would love to see Spielberg and Peter Jackson collaborating for an Indy Movie...<br/><br/>Now what really stood out was the CGI, made by Weta Digital, which is probably the best company in offering computer animated lifelike characters. ""Tintin"" offers, whitout doubt, the best Character CGI since Camerons Avatar. During the first 5 minutes of the film my jaw almost dropped when I saw how detailed and realistic the characters appeared on screen. You can see every single hair on Tintin's forehead moving in the wind. The eyes don't seem dead (which is a major problem in character animation), they seem very realistic. Some scenes are animated so well, that they almost look like live action footage.<br/><br/>""Tintin"" is a fantastic movie, the story is very simple, but it has wit, spectacular action and top notch CGI which is expected to win an Oscar (something would be wrong if it wouldn't)."
"LloydBayer","Null","0","3","5 November 2011"," Great Snakes!
","Back in 1988, cinema audiences were spellbound with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", a live action film that integrates conventional animation. 21 years later, James Cameron upped the ante with ""Avatar"", a superb universe rendered by 80% motion capture animation. Although Cameron took ten years to materialize what he often refers to as his pet project, Steven Spielberg has been an avid Tintin fan since the early 1980s. So you and I can only imagine what levels of passion and energy must have gone into the making of this film. In two words, stunning and spectacular! In terms of visual brilliance and sheer magnitude of scale, Spielberg as director and Peter Jackson as producer has outdone everyone else in the film making industry. THIS IS the new era of animation and more than just recommending this film as a must watch, I urge you to witness for yourself, what will soon be referred to as the groundbreaking turning point in the world of animated films.<br/><br/>Titled ""The Secret of the Unicorn"", Tintin's adventure here is actually combined with two other books by creator Hergé, namely, ""The crab with the Golden Claws"" and ""Red Rackham's Treasure"". Integrating these three books into one epic screenplay is the phenomenal work of British screenwriters Steven Moffat, Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish. With this movie, Tintin embarks on a perilous adventure when he buys a three-mast model ship for a steal. He soon learns that this scaled down version of ""The Unicorn"" is much more valuable than it seems and it is one of three identical models. After evading a mysterious buyer called Sakharine, TinTin discovers that each model ship is made to conceal a secret message. Before he can investigate further, Tintin finds himself bound and gagged on-board a ship. With the help of his trusty fox-terrier dog Snowy, Tintin is freed but literally bumps into the ship's skipper, captain Haddock. Consumed by years of ill-luck and dependency on the bottle, Haddock soon realizes that he is but a pawn in Sakharine's grand scheme of things and that there is more to the latter than meets the eye. Together, Haddock and Tintin must now outwit Sakharine in finding the other two model ships, but not before coming face to face with haphazard danger and a centuries old family secret.<br/><br/>Early reviews of this film compared it to the likeness of ""The Polar Express"", a 2004 animation that was one of the first to use motion capture technology. With Motion ""performance"" technology, the difference is huge as there is no real comparison to any other animated film so far. Digital 3 D adds extra depth and clarity but there aren't many moments that will have you bobbing and weaving or extending your arm to grab something splashed out of the screen. Jackson's trump card is Academy Award winning visual effects supervisor, Joe Letteri— the man responsible for visual effects from ""The Abyss"" (1989) to ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"" (2011) and almost every big budget movie in between that required a heavy dose of CGI. Once again, Letteri delivers beyond expectations with such visual quality, you have to see it to believe it. While close-ups are gorgeously detailed, wide-angle scenes look unbelievably realistic. Some background characters look so real, you have to look again to figure out if real humans were filmed. Character's noses are somewhat disproportionate and oddly shaped, but this is in keeping with Hergé's original art work from the comic books. On that note, this film stays true to the comic books with various characters popping up here and there, along with keeping with the Noirish period setting of the books. Tintin fanboys will savor every moment of the film. In the packed cinema hall, I could easily differentiate sections of the audience that were Tintin fans as compared to other viewers. Most probably intended by Spielberg, there are scenes and dialogue that only a true Tintin fan would recognize and appreciate.<br/><br/>Most notable as one of the Bielski brothers in ""Defiance"", this is Jamie Bell in his first ever lead role as the titled boy-reporter. Bell is perfectly cast and vindicates Amblin Entertainment's choice in bringing Tintin to three dimensional life. Voicing the villainous Sakharine and another character I don't want to mention, Daniel Craig is good but somehow appears more cynical than sinister. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost voices the bumbling Thompson twins and contributes to some of the comic moments in the film. For me, the show stealer is definitely Haddock with some of the best lines, best scenes and some great moments including a spectacular flashback. Kudos to Andy Serkis again! After Caesar in ""Rise of the Planet of the Apes"", this is his second lovable character this year. Other nostalgic characters include Aristides Silk as the pickpocket, Allan the goon and Bianca Castafiore as the Milanese Nightingale.<br/><br/>On a whole, this movie is not short of action, suspense and comedy and provides great entertainment for the whole family. There are plenty of Spielberg's hallmark swashbuckling moments as seen in his last directorial ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". As such, get set for one roller-coaster of a cloak and dagger ride with Tintin, Snowy and Haddock dodging bullets, ducking swords and chasing villains. For an animation, I did feel a void when it came to emotional characterization. Unlike ""Bambi"" or ""The Lion King"", there isn't a single moving or heart tugging moment. Then again, I don't think Spielberg intended for this as the books are too fast paced for any sort of emotional attachment with the reader.<br/><br/>On a final note, and if you think you see Spielberg's name all over this movie, I see something more: An Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Feature, as this may not be Spielberg's best movie to date, but it is easily the best animated film of 2011."
