"MR_Heraclius","9","46","49","13 February 2020"," The Conjuring
","""The Conjuring"" is one of the most thrilling horror film to have come out in recent times. It is up there with ""Sinister"" as one of the scariest films I have watched. Since it's based off of ""true events"", it makes it even more interesting. I can't quite give it a full 10 star rating because it does have quite a few jump scares, but at least a good portion of those jump scares add to the atmosphere of this movie. If you are a first time watcher of this movie, it will certainly disturb you for a while. It doesn't stick with me like ""Sinister"" does long after, but The Conjuring is a fun watch and I always love coming back for a rewatch every now and then."
"thejoshl","9","542","687","17 July 2013"," With virtually no sex, no gore and no cursing The Conjuring earns its R-rating on scares alone.
","Who would've guessed that the director of Saw would end up being the most inventive horror filmmaker working in the industry? James Wan brilliantly takes us back to the retro days of horror, delivering an extremely stylistic, visually striking horror film that stands tall amongst the classics. With virtually no sex, no gore and no cursing The Conjuring earns its R-rating on scares alone.<br/><br/>Set in 1971, The Conjuring focuses on the married paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren, who lecture at colleges across the US on all the interesting cases they come across. Just as they're thinking of retirement cue the Perron family; parents Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn (Lili Taylor) are scared for their lives and the lives of their 5 daughters claiming there is something evil in their now Rhode Island home. It doesn't take long for the Warrens to discover that the Perron's are being tormented by something supernatural, but what is it, and what does it want?<br/><br/>In short: The Conjuring is the most terrifying film I've ever seen. Trying to erase his name from the ""torture porn"" crowd has proved difficult for the director of Saw, however without a doubt he's finally done it. On looks alone this movie should be a PG movie, which would normally be frowned upon by the horror junkies, but despite having no sex, no gore and no swearing, James Wan's latest film has been slapped with an R rating anyway. If you're wondering how frightening it actually is I think the MPAA has spoken on its behalf.<br/><br/>Most horror films these days climax somewhere in the middle; and in turn everything that follows doesn't really have the same affect. In The Conjuring there is comic relief brilliantly placed throughout to bring you down from your own climax so they get another chance to build your fear up and startle you again. Wan understands the psychology behind tension and builds suspense through mere scene construction.<br/><br/>While obviously taking notes from the Exorcist and The Amityville Horror, the inspiration for this film derives from real case files from the Warren's, which is still their most famous case to date. Straying away from the ironic style made famous by The Cabin In The Woods, nothing on the surface of this story seems inventive, but I assure you the way in which this film works makes it one of the most creative films in recent memory. One thing I've always loved about James Wan is how he manages to take something so unoriginal, like the haunted-house- possession story in this case, and shows it to us like we've never seen it before.<br/><br/>The scares, pacing, sound design and camera work can only be described as precise. Together James Wan and cinematographer John Leonetti (responsible for the look of Insidious as well) give us a fresh visual style that, unlike most horror films, include a lot of wide shots AND movement. The cinematography is absolutely stunning, and not relying on shaky cam for its realism leaves a rather unique feel to the movie, separating it visually from any other movie you can narratively relate this to.<br/><br/>One issue I've always had with recent films in the genre was that they revealed the demons too much. Insidious and Sinister are examples where they hooked me to the story and then showed me too much. Fear of the unknown is the greatest thing a horror filmmaker has on its audience and Wan has definitely learned from Insidious. In The Conjuring the apparitions aren't revealed to the audience until way late, and even then they're far away or out of focus. Letting us use our imagination is what makes this film truly horrifying, and I think horror filmmakers should be taking notes from Mr. Wan.<br/><br/>This film is everything I wanted it to be and more, my only complaint about the movie isn't even something wrong with the film. Once again marketing has screwed us over and the trailer for The Conjuring reveals way too many of the scares. I avoided most of the trailers for this movie on command from James Wan's twitter account but it's hard to miss TV spots. I wish I went into this with a fresh mind so if you still haven't seen the trailer and want to see this film, please stay away from any of the marketing!<br/><br/>Ultimately the overall production value allows The Conjuring to stand out in an otherwise rotting genre. The acting is impressive, the practical effects are perfect and the classic 70s feel Wan was going for make for a great time at the movies. This is the first must-see film of the summer.<br/><br/>Our Rating: 9.0/10<br/><br/>Let me know on Twitter @thejoshl what you thought of The Conjuring!"
"skeletonman13","10","336","450","19 July 2013"," By far one of the best horror movies I've seen in a while.
","I'm an avid horror fan. Lately I've been thinking there isn't much that can scare me (though Sinister got under my skin). I appreciate James Wan's films, I love the first Saw, Insidious was a damn good modern ghost story, but like all reviews have stated for it, the movie kinda loses it's momentum in the final act.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is better, scarier, and more tense than Insidious. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's one of the best horror movies of the last 5 or 10 years. It goes back to the classic rule of horror film making, never show the bad guy fully to your audience. Plus this movie knows suspense, I tell you, I almost threw a water bottle at the screen from sheer terror once the scare finally happened. There are no fake jump scares, the movie earned an R rating without any blood, sex, or profanity, it's all from the terror that this movie builds upon.<br/><br/>Not only is the movie scary, but as a film itself, it's almost a masterpiece. The script, acting, direction, style, tone, etc were all simply top notch. Wan's camera-work here is by far his best out of any of his movies. The choice to set the movie in the 70s was a stroke of genius as it feels so authentic and all the more real. If this story were set in the present, it simply wouldn't be as a effective or scary. The 70s style film making, costuming, and hair styling are a great throwback to likes of The Exorcist & The Amityville Horror.<br/><br/>Though there are a few (extremely minor) flaws, such are length, repetitiveness, and a resolution that happens way too fast. I don't care, every horror movie (or movie in general) has it's flaws. There will never be a perfect horror movie, if there is one, I haven't seen it yet. But all I know is James Wan's The Conjuring is one of the best horror movies I've seen in a long time, and it's been a really long time that a movie has scared me this badly.<br/><br/>10/10 Don't miss this one, it's an amazing theater viewing experience."
"mungflesh","9","341","461","30 June 2013"," New life breathed into a classic sub-genre
","""Don't summon the devil, don't call the priest ...""<br/><br/>I was one of a lucky few to have seen The Conjuring at a preview screening for FrightFest 2013.<br/><br/>I went in totally cold, not having seen a trailer, nor knowing anything about the story or plot and it turned out to be one of the best scary horror movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is a nail-biting, hiding-behind-hands movie. If you've been disappointed with the likes of Paranormal Acivity and Insidious, this one is likely to deliver in areas where they failed.<br/><br/>It tells the supposedly true story of two paranormal investigators, who aim to rid families and properties of their suspected supernatural visitations, either by disproving them (if they turn out to be just creaky floorboards or slamming doors) or tackling them head-on if not. A leap of faith is required to buy into this theme but if you're okay with it, then the movies plays out pretty well within its genre confines.<br/><br/>The particular incident they are brought in to deal with is described as surrounding a spirit 'so malevolent' it was hidden from the public until only now. In fairly Amityville-like circumstances, a family move into a new house and discover the basement is sealed; boarded-up behind a doorway.<br/><br/>It's not at all surprising what follows, once they decide to take a look in the basement but it is surprising how James Wan has managed to take such a tired theme of haunting and possession and revive it so convincingly.<br/><br/>I am no stranger to these kind of movies but this one truly tops them all for tension and terror. I really enjoyed Sinister recently, which I found to be equally as scary but it lost its way a bit towards the end, whereas The Conjuring keeps tempo and has a fairly satisfying conclusion. <br/><br/>I particularly liked the way the film took a turn for the comical somewhere in the middle, only for perhaps five minutes, then came back firing on all cylinders as it headed to the finale. If this was intentional, to lure us into a false sense of security, it worked beautifully.<br/><br/>If you're the type to poo-poo this genre in general, I can't see you suddenly being converted to a believer but, if you enjoy classic horror like The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist, I can almost guarantee The Conjuring won't disappoint."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","75","101","16 June 2014"," It's November 1st, 1971, I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron, who with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.
","The key with The Conjuring is not that it has freshness on its side, as evidenced by the ream of horror fans arguing on internet sites about ""nothing new on the table"" , but while those fans will be going hungry for a very, very long time, The Conjuring does everything right for the splinter of horror it deals with.<br/><br/>There's a lot to admire about a horror film that in this day and age stands tall and proud against the ream of remakes, sequels and teen friendly slashers that ""haunt"" the multiplexes with all too much frequency these days. Free of gore and sex, this was automatically going to alienate a good portion of the lustful members of the horror fan base, but for those who like their horror served with appetising scares and a cauldron of suspense, then this delivers plenty to your particular table.<br/><br/>Forget the ""based on a true story"" tag, since it's kind of irrelevant in this new technological age, it's a selling gimmick that actually means ""this story might be true and we might have played with it a bit"". Regardless of hoax charges and embellishments, just buy into the premise, commit to it as a scary story in the same way as director James Wan has, for then the rewards are there for the compliant.<br/><br/>Story essentially is based around an investigation in the early seventies by paranormal specialists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who aided the Perron family as they were victims of dreadful supernatural events at their Rhode Island home. Wan builds it deftly, letting us into the Perron families lives as they move into what they believe to be a dream home. Then things start to happen, but again Wan builds it in slow instances, creating a palpable sense of dread, his camera work intelligent. So when the big moments come they have maximum impact and have us also yearning for the Warren's to get involved.<br/><br/>There is no over killing of the boo-jump scares, they are placed with care and marry up superbly with the mounting tension. Naturally all the cliché conventions of the haunted house movie are here, strange smells, creaky doors, ominous cellar and etc, yet these are supplemented with Wan's talented knack for a good scare and a very effective production design. From mysterious bruises and literal leg pulls – breath holding games of hide and seek – to bona fide pant soiling moments, The Conjuring is a lesson in sustained unease until the big finale is unleashed.<br/><br/>The script is devoid of cheese and pointless filler, itself refreshing in a horror sub-genre that suffers often with these problems. Joseph Bishara's musical score is an absolute nerve shredder, and again it's a refreshing accompaniment because it doesn't resort to telegraphed shrieks to tell us to be afraid, it never overwhelms a scene. John Leonetti's cinematography has Gothic textures, both in the house and outside of the lakeside farmhouse, while the strong lead cast of Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston come up trumps for sure.<br/><br/>Met with critical and box office success, The Conjuring justifies its reputation as a superb haunted house movie. 9/10"
"R-P-McMurphy","9","212","309","6 July 2013"," James Wan at his best
","""The Conjuring"" is a high class horror film, its hard not to be scared by it, we care for the characters and the story is compelling enough to make you feel interested the whole time.<br/><br/>Based on true life events, Ed and Lorraine Warren are paranormal investigators set to help a family terrorized by a demon, said to be one of the most terrifying cases of their lives which they hadn't shared with anyone...until now.<br/><br/>First of all, I loved that it takes place in the 70's, I agree completely with director James Wan's point of view that it is almost impossible to make a horror film set in the present. For example, the teenage daughters of the haunted family would be taking pictures of the demons with their iphones and would be posting them on posting them on instagram, basically the demons would turn into the victims and the humans would be the bad guys.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect though, there are a few plot holes in it, but still it does have some great scares in it that had me jumping out my seat and I liked the way it builds up tension and lets us know the characters before it starts with all the craziness. Not only is the movie set in the 70's, but it also has the feel of a 70's horror film, with slow zooms and filming styles you wouldn't expect from a modern movie. I really believe James Wan has outdone himself with this movie, I'll even go so far to calling it the scariest movie I've seen in my life. Thank you James Wan for this great movie and good luck with Fast & Furious 7.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great horror film, I guess it gives the feeling audiences must have felt when watching ""The Exorcist"", ""Don't Look Now"", or Poltergeist"" for the first time."
"chapy004","10","303","464","25 June 2013"," An instant gem among the classic horror titles.
","I got a chance to see this movie at the film festival, and boy was I TERRifically surprised! James Wan's 'The Conjuring' is one of those rare gems in the horror industry that finds a spot beside the classic titles of horror, 'The Shining', 'Poltergeist', and 'The Exorcist' due to James Wan's ability to balance an atmospheric dreadful tale involving wonderfully crafted characters with a haunted house that had my palms sweating and my heart pounding during some of the most horrifying moments (There are a few of those; make sure you empty your bladder BEFORE entering the theater).<br/><br/>The things that make 'The Shining', 'Poltergeist', and 'The Exorcist' good is that if the editor were to chop out all the jump-scares and those sequences that fry an image into your brain, you would still have a moody, edgy story that makes you sympathies for the characters and their struggle. This is what Wan does right in this film, and it's then that you realize horror is more than what pops out at you, or what makes you scream. Rather, it's that feeling of dread you get that escalates into sheer terror and suspense, aided by shocking scares.<br/><br/>BUT WAIT! All this not to say 'The Conjuring' doesn't have its share of frightening visuals and pee-your-pants moments; believe me when I say I also rank this as one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. Yet, Wan realizes here that jump scares aren't what moves a story along, but what defines that classic image everyone gets in their head when someone talks about a certain horror movie that frightened them the most, kind of like a celebrity's autograph in the corner of a huge poster of their face.<br/><br/>All of this hence to say, ""The Conjuring"" is an exceptional piece of film that pulls all the right stops to frighten the audience, leaving a lasting impression on your mind as well the recently tired genre of horror.<br/><br/>Movie Score: 10/10!"
"monkeybrainjam","Null","363","567","9 June 2013"," This movie is amazing

It also opens a door for becoming quite a paranormal investigator myself, looking up for all the details mentioned in the movie, and getting amazed by it' accuracy.<br/><br/>This film it's made to become a new classic in the horror genre, not only because it's quality, but because it's fright factor.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie it's paced down, let you know and love the characters. but the second half! oh boy! it's so damn chilling it will keep you gasping and crawling your hands.<br/><br/>Very well done"
"a-andrew900","10","235","373","15 July 2013"," Holy F*** is all people with me said while watching it throughout.
","This film was easily one of the scariest films of the decade, complete with a horror package that will make even those new to horror love it, if they are a fan of fear that is. This movie had every guy in the group at the edge of their seats with their girlfriends....it was an intense experience that cannot be missed in theatres. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmega hold their own as the Perron's and EVERY SINGLE child actor owned the screen. All acting was top notch and gave the viewer a throwback to original days of good horror, not the stuff we've seen nowadays. Time can only tell when a movie like this will come out again but we know now that James Wan is one of the best horror directors of our time."
"Red-Barracuda","9","134","214","28 June 2013"," A properly scary ghost story
","This latest movie from Saw director James Wan goes down a fairly traditional haunted house film route. In it, a regular family move into a new home and are immediately terrorised by a malevolent ghost; a married couple who specialise in dealing with paranormal activity are called in to help exorcise the evil spirit. It was seemingly based on a true story. From the above synopsis you could be forgiven for thinking that this is a re-tread of the likes of The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist. And I suppose in many ways you would be correct as the influence of these types of films is pretty evident. But that would only be half the story because The Conjuring is a film that definitely stands up on its own right and for my money is one of the very best horror films of the last few years. The chief reason for this is simply that at times it is very scary indeed. It's not a graphic horror film at all; it relies on the fear of the unknown and the unseen. It combines lots of the things that make traditional ghost stories so sinister – an old house, a hidden room, a witch, tragic histories, possession, creepy old children's toys and, of course, well-placed jump scares. This movie has all of these elements and uses them well. It doesn't necessarily bring a lot of new things to the genre but what it does do is expertly arrange several traditional ideas into a very satisfying whole.<br/><br/>On top of all this, it's a very well-acted affair. Particularly impressive are Vera (The Departed) Farmiga and Patrick (Hard Candy) Wilson who play the paranormal experts. They have a definite chemistry with one-and-other and bring a solid believability to their characters. And pleasingly they play things completely straight. Also of interest is the time period. Seeing as this is based around true events, its set in 1971. As well as being more authentic to the story, this has the added benefit of having a retro feel that harks back to the classic 70's American horror movies in which it derives much of its influence. And there is something refreshing in immersing yourself in a world without mobile phones and tweeting; a world without such things seems to work better as far as traditional haunted house stories go.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent horror film. If I had to criticise it in one way it would simply be that the intense finale wasn't as creepy as the build-up. The reason for that is really down to the fact that the slower build-up allows for moments that hit you out of left-field from nowhere and the quieter more deliberately paced sequences can be constructed up to a real genuine fright scene. By the end we know the source of the haunting and we are constantly tensed up during the final encounter meaning it doesn't have the same impact as the earlier scary moments. But I have to emphasise that this is really a very minor point and I really highly recommend The Conjuring to horror fans and more specifically those who like films about ghosts. Great stuff."
"Duveteux","6","109","175","7 August 2013"," Why Did I Fall For The Trap?
","I always do this. I see a film get 10 out of 10 and people rave about it being terrifying and I get my hopes up like maybe this will be completely different to what's out there right now. Maybe it will be a good ghost story, a good classic horror I'll lose sleep over or will repeat itself in my mind on the night bus home until I become paranoid of every dark figure on the street.<br/><br/>I remember the day I came home on a night bus scared to look out of the window cause even my own reflection might change into the face of another! You know what? It's been so long since that day I don't remember what that feels like anymore.<br/><br/>It's OK, I'll give it 6 out of 10. The last half an hour is better than the first hour. There's nothing in it we haven't seen before in the past few years.<br/><br/>I don't see the point of the doll possessed by a demon when it does nothing scary and is far too farcical to be considered scary. A creepy doll could easily be a simple porcelain doll with blank expression and vacant eyes staring. Remember when a room full of perfectly ordinary ornate dolls sounded ominous? It doesn't have to be a clown-like ventriloquist dummy with scars that doesn't even look convincingly like it was ever a child's toy but destined to be a demon conduit.<br/><br/>Maybe the doll was the idea of the person involved with the making of Saw. Cause it seems like it was too similar in its clownishness.<br/><br/>I'm ignoring the fact this is ""based on a true story"" by the way. Maybe the doll was real and did look exactly like that. Maybe everything in the film is spot on and why should they bend the truth to appease my want for seeing a horror movie that's different to others on offer out there? Fair enough! Coming from the people who told us absolutely everything in the Amityville Horror was true, though... I'm inclined to believe they've bent the truth somewhat and could have done more to make me scared of my own shadow.<br/><br/>The only good bits reminded me of other films, the crazy old witch ghost who vomits blood into the woman's mouth is suspiciously similar to the old bat from Drag me to Hell, which once again has been done - IF it hadn't been done it would have been a good bit, but because I can only think of something else when I see it...nah.<br/><br/>I'm fed up with them trying ghost stories and possession horror. Please find a new way to try and scare me because you only seem to be throwing the same things at me. It's like a ghost jumping out at me and hiding back away in the same spot for the next time I come in because it thinks ""it worked once, so this must be the only way to do it"". Only the first time will make me jump. Eventually it just becomes tedious."
"Simon_Says_Movies","8","143","235","22 July 2013"," A Gripping, Tense and Overall Masterful Genre Revival
","Like comedy, the horror genre can be a very subjective beast, finding or missing its mark as much do to its craft and execution as it does the particular individual who plops themselves into a theater seat. If something isn't scary to someone – someone who earnestly believes that of course – then a fright flick has failed at its core intent. Then we have something like James Wan's The Conjuring, an artful, confident throwback that succeeds in maintaining a high tensile level of pressure on our senses, crafting vital jump scares, a potent human element and all encompassing technical prowess. This is the type of brave, but stripped down horror filmmaking that forces you to analyze other elements besides just the full effectiveness of its frightening intent. Plus it's scary as hell. <br/><br/>The Conjuring completes a modern supernatural horror film trifecta started with Wan's own Insidious in 2010 and bridged by last year's unsettling Sinister. With these films the genre has proved that this is far from a dead, now inherently clichéd area of cinema and this effort is perhaps the best of all three. After breaking onto the scene in a big way with the trend setting Saw, the director took a bit of creative detour in the eyes of most with revenge thriller Death Sentence and supernatural doll flick Dead Silence (which is vastly underrated by the way) before rebounding with the aforementioned Insidious. For The Conjuring it seems Wan has taken everything he's learned – congealing everything he's found to be effective – and assembled them exquisitely and with ample new flare to boot. <br/><br/>The Conjuring pulls its inspiration from a case file of famed demonologists and paranormal investigators the Warrens, the husband and wife team who's other journeys inspired films such as The Amityville Horror. Here they are played respectively by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who are now both genre regulars with roles in Insidious and the upcoming Chapter 2 due this year for the gentleman and Orphan and television's Psycho prequel Bates Motel for Farmiga. We've all seen the painful trope of priests, exorcists, psychics and every nut-job in between showing up at the eleventh hour to save a haunted family but the way they're approached in The Conjuring stands as one of the film's greatest strengths. <br/><br/>Though it's something that should be completely obvious out of the gate (but still something those inspired by the Warren's stories forget) this is just as much their story as those experiencing the phenomena. In giving nearly as much screen time to this duo as it does the Perron's (a seven family troop lead by actors Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor and their five daughters) we grow and involve with these nine individuals so when things get terrifying we not only feel just as much for everyone on screen but everyone gets a satisfying arc. It's something so rare in most horror films. Though this dynamic is certainly not presented through these two separate camps – the fearful and the experts – but the men bond over their love of cars and their wives and the women over the unfathomable: harm befalling their children. It's a satisfying an utterly untapped approach for the genre.<br/><br/>But ""wait, wait"" you proclaim ""this is a horror movie after all, stop talking about the little girls and get to the scares!"" Graciously, somewhat rude reader. The Conjuring is creepy, intermittently nightmarish, tense, gross, unsettling, and in its purest form, scary. This is the type of film that dares you not to hug yourself or laugh nervously in the hopes you deflect some iota of the sensation of primal fear. But these emotions are never extracted in a manipulative fashion and the jump scares are orchestrated effectively through physical objects falling, bumping, banging and generally causing off-putting noises, not blaring, out of context musical chords. <br/><br/>The camera work is also fantastic employing every angle imaginable and even some very impressive point of view and upside-down-spin shots. It's easily Wan's best directed effort to date but never one that lets its style eclipse the mood. Similarly his use of sound both in the score (which utilizes your average brooding options as well as sharp, grating notes that call back to horror of days gone by) and practical noises such as a strained rope swinging or a door slamming shut. Again, it all adds to the experience and in eventually pulling of the major frights. <br/><br/>Like most fare of this nature, the restrained tension does take a bit of a hit heading into the finale, as subtlety is sacrificed for more overt horror to resolve the story. Thankfully this change in approach is handled with just as much aplomb and also manages to deliver one of the most effective exorcism sequences in recent memory – a victory made all the more notable thanks to the generally overexposed and silly nature of that staple. It's not the perfect ending that the previous acts demanded but one that by no means insults the audience and still remains scary (if in a more upfront manner). <br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest compliment I can pay The Conjuring is that it actually deserves a sequel. There are tales of the Warrens left to tell and the acting is uniformly strong enough that revisiting these characters would be more a treat then a chore. It takes a skillful filmmaker to take well worn themes and approaches (while avoiding gore and a high body count to boot) and make them seem as original as ever. Coming from a huge horror buff and one that experiences more disappointments then the average soul can handle, I can earnestly say The Conjuring is one of the best ever and what can serve as a fantastic induction into the genre for the uninitiated."
"billygoat1071","8","88","141","19 August 2013"," Bringing Back The Terror
","The Conjuring claims to be based on a true story about one of the Warrens' paranormal investigations. At this point, that fact doesn't quite matter, especially when this is mostly designed as a horror movie. And as a horror movie, its job is to offer real terror and take any ghostly elements seriously. The film isn't actually trying to give newer scares. This is old school stuff, but good old school horror movie stuff. This is the kind that gets to do more than pull off another jump scare trick. Another benefit the movie got is its director, James Wan, who delivers a crafty storytelling. The Conjuring is not terribly innovative, but I don't think it needed to. It's the execution that keeps everything so gripping, and I think we needed that in this suffering era of the genre.<br/><br/>The story is actually more than the haunting of the Perrons. The first act juxtaposed between their situation and the life of the Warrens. The Warrens side is a fascinating little exposition of their daily life and job, while the Perrons are introduced like any typical horror film that has a haunted house and family in it, the danger is slow burn until they get to realize they needed help. What makes this somewhat different from those clichés is we are also supposed to root and care for the investigators, like we do not want them to be harm by the spirits as well. For that, the tension becomes much effective.<br/><br/>Even at the less scary scenes, the film is also interesting. And yes, all the characters are worth rooting for. The major ones get their own stories told at the beginning and some flashbacks in the middle of the mystery. The performances are pretty enjoyable as they take the viewers into the characters' mind. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are excellent at exploring their roles and whatever they do are totally intriguing. Lili Taylor is engaging enough for shifting her character's innocence to something terrifying.<br/><br/>Most of the credit goes to director James Wan who makes it all compelling. We already accepted that jump scares are inevitable to our modern horror movies, but the better scares go when it shows its campiness, like the creepy update of the Annabelle doll, and some demonic masks and makeup. They are unlike to today's tricks that depend on gore and repetitive noise. There is also genuine terror can be felt in the quiet scenes. The finale is kind of ridiculous, but it's filled with energetic action which makes the ride even much fun. Apart from the scary stuff, the film continues to employ its style that serves a lot of magnificent shots. This could be one of the best looking movies I've seen this year. The music score brings sorts of good chills.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is no groundbreaker, but the film is best at recapturing the classic horror. Extra merit is fleshing out and adding depth to the story which made the ghost hunting investigation more thrilling. The craft is amazing and the performances are terrific. I think it has most of the things that lack in our horror films today; curiously setting the pieces together, relateable characters, good creeps, and full insanity. The Conjuring isn't meant to change the game, but because of the filmmakers' ambition and love for the genre, it is a marvelous experience."

Sure there's no gore, no nudity, no profanity... but so what? I see that same statement made in every horror movie review I read. The thing is... most horror films AREN'T filled with gore and nudity, and haven't been that way since the 80s. It's nothing new and it doesn't make this movie special.<br/><br/>By no means is this film deserving of such rave reviews. I'd give it a four out of ten at best. It was entertaining and the cinematography was great, but it's lacking in all other aspects.<br/><br/>This genre has been done to death. I mean honestly... you'll find every ghost story cliché you can think of right here in this film. If that's what you're looking for, by all means, watch the movie. Be my guest. But if you're looking for something new, fresh, and genuinely scary... The Conjuring isn't what you're after.<br/><br/>The amount of clichés is laughable. Off the top of my head, this film contains:<br/><br/>A typical old haunted house, suspenseful music leading up to disappointing jump-scares, loud banging noises, creaky doors, creepy dolls, creepy little girls, doors opening by themselves, objects flying around the room, stupid characters making stupid choices, minimal lighting and flickering lights, bad costume make-up, humorous whispering and 'demonic' voices.<br/><br/>I've seen it all before. Over and over and over again. When will film- makers dare to be different? When will they finally stray from the typical horror movie formula? Critics will tell you to see this movie for its nostalgic essence... I'm sorry, but nostalgic value is no excuse to blatantly copy ideas from classic filmmakers. <br/><br/>I'll admit that the suspense frightened me. I was expecting something shocking to appear on the screen any minute. The score was great and very atmospheric, but unfortunately, it all built up to nothing. The jump-scares, badly made-up faces and loud banging noises were laughable.<br/><br/>And may I ask why Reagan from The Exorcist was in this film? One of the ""spooks"" was literally a carbon copy of her. This movie was nothing but a copy of a copy of a copy.<br/><br/>And what was with that scene with the cameraman and one of the daughters? They stared at each other and flirted a bit, as if something was going to blossom between them... but nothing came of it. Pointless.<br/><br/>4/10"
"sccrwsmr","3","140","247","20 July 2013"," Did i see the same movie as everyone else?
","The Conjuring is not nearly as bad as it could have been, it did have some pretty solid jump scares and every actor could hold their own on screen. However; This movie had way too much going on, there were witches, evil dolls, possession, demons, psychic visions, etc. Waiting for each of the sub plots to come to their epic conclusion felt like watching paint dry as the scenario breaks into even smaller pieces and more sub plots appear. The ending didn't feel like an effective pay off at all, and call me simple but i prefer a bit of grisly violence in my horror movies which this movie was devoid of. <br/><br/>Not to mention the ghosts were not scary looking in the least bit (with the exception of that damn doll) and they looked like they were ripped right out of insidious, which just takes away from the movie.<br/><br/>This movie is just jump scares irrelevant to the plot and a boring excuse to cash in out the success of insidious."
"Likes_Ninjas90","3","127","229","14 July 2013"," The only lesson to take from The Conjuring is never to trust ""Amityville Real Estate""
","The only lesson to take from The Conjuring is never to trust ""Amityville Real Estate"". This terribly cliché and derivative haunted house movie is based on a supposedly true story. It's from the archives of Ed Warren and his wife Lorraine, two demonologists and paranormal investigators. If you believe this tosh you'll also believe they have seen vampires, werewolves and performed exorcisms. They did establish a legitimate organisation in 1952 called ""The New England Society for Psychic Research"". For all of its scientific breakthroughs involving vampires, this work has never prevented them from earning good dollars. After being discharged from the Second World War, Ed attended art school and painted houses that he said were haunted and then sold them.<br/><br/>One of their most famous cases was the Amityville story. In 1974 Ronald DeFeo shot his six family members to death as they lay asleep in their beds in a property in Amityville, Long Island. The following year, George and Kathy Lutz and their three children moved into the same house and claimed it was haunted. Ed and Lorraine were the lead paranormal investigators. Despite entire books debunking the supernatural aspect of the case, calling it a hoax, the Warrens became consultants on the terrible film adaptation four years later. It was followed by ten follow-up films, including a remake and a new entry releasing this year. Though they would deny it, the Warrens are also religiously motivated. They were devout Catholics and on one of their websites, Warren is quoted as saying: ""And I know that Biblical beliefs are facts because I've seen and I've heard and I've felt all the things that it talks about."" I don't know if they were fundamentalists, but that's how they're represented in The Conjuring.<br/><br/>There is a fascinating biopic to be made out of the lives of the Warrens but that would be overreaching for the film's director James Wan. Malaysian born but Australian-raised, he has failed to match his mega hit Saw, the start of a sadistic, repugnant series that led to the rise and fall of the torture porn sub-genre He then retreated from the excessive gore and faux-moral ethics to Insidious: a lousy haunted house movie that wasn't scary in the slightest. So rarely does The Conjuring divert from Insidious in story and quality that it could be regarded as a remake. The film is set in 1971 and like Amityville Horror and Insidious it involves a couple (played by Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) and their children moving into a two-story house by the lake, and are terrorized by strange noises, smells, creaking doors and more violent actions, like people being flung across the room. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga feature as Ed and Lorraine, and their investigation uncovers a history of witches, demon possession and human sacrifice that overshadows a numbingly repetitive main story of thumps, creaks and uncountable clichés.<br/><br/>One of the failures of the script by Chad and Carey Hayes and Wan's direction is that they have no sense of ""the uncanny"". In his essay ""The Uncanny"", Freud refers to the German word ""unheimlich"", which he says is the opposite of ""heimlich"" (homely), and therefore the contrary of what is familiar. Similarly, he argues the uncanny is a result of ""intellectual uncertainty"", meaning something uncanny can be one that a person is unfamiliar with and has not explored yet. There is nothing unfamiliar or uncanny in The Conjuring. By resembling other fictional horror movies, it diminishes the authenticity of the real case. The horror is merely a boring retread of genre conventions and it fails to subvert these tired staples. <br/><br/>The actors are confined to playing underwritten, stock characters in a two-story house, pitched on a grey block of land, with overgrown trees and too many banging doors. Wan loves Amityville but its outright plagiarism that the architecture of the house is identical. It also isn't scary in 2013 to have creaking doors and floorboards, and characters dumb enough to follow noises coming from dank basements and closets - it just shows a depressing lack of ingenuity. Long shots of eerie doorways telegraph potential big scares and are followed repeatedly by loud banging noises. If Wan had any subtlety as a filmmaker he would know horror is dependent on the imagination, not how loud you can make a film.<br/><br/>The Conjuring shares an uncomfortably firm relationship with archaic religious practices too. There are obvious iconographic references to films like The Exorcist and The Birds. However, the film's climax in a basement involving an exorcism isn't an extension of the horror but in the eyes of the film a probable means of healing. The self-belief in this brand of silly, fundamentalist exploitation is also compounded through laughable dialogue such as: ""God brought us here for a reason"", and ""Religious icons p*ss them off"". Yet if anyone takes this bunkum seriously they will be too young to remember the likes of The Exorcist and Amityville. Bloodless, tired and overly familiar, The Conjuring was a story not worth telling again but that could be the fault of its origins, and not just the derivative style chosen by its inexperienced director."

","First of, the whole hype about the ""doll"" has nothing to do with the whole plot of the haunted house the family just moved in.

The only jump you get from watching this movie is like jumping off your seat to head for the exit."
"AlukardsCastle","10","58","103","8 July 2013"," One of the Great horror movies.
","*Short Synopsis* We all know by now that this movie is based on true events. The film advertised how the family of the house kept quiet about the incidents for over 30 years because the public couldn't handle what happened. The movie is set in the 1970s when the family of a farmhouse begins experiencing paranormal events. The real life paranormal investigators Ed and Loraine Warren are called in to make sense of what is going on. Then the events become more intense and violent until the climatic conclusion. <br/><br/>This may sound like another typical ghost house plot, but this movie was so much more. I personally love James Wans work in the horror genre. I loved the original Saw, directed by him, and even some of the sequels which were not directed by him. I loved the intensely creepy movie ""Dead Silence"". I even liked his attempt at the thriller revenge film with ""Death Sentence"". Then he made a big comeback in the horror genre with the landmark film ""Insidious"" which terrified many, and made many think it was pretentious. The film was written by his friend Leigh Whannell, who also wrote and starred in Saw. It was polarized with great reviews and some negative reviews. But most great horror movies go through that type of reaction at the time of its release. Now it is considered a modern classic in the genre. It even has a sequel ""Insidious Chapter 2"" which is directed by Wan and again written by Whannell, so that seems legit! But before Insidious 2, James was rumored to direct another Horror movie. So then I began anticipating James Wans next movie. I heard about ""The Conjuring"" being in production, but that it wasn't being written by Whannell. I was slightly less interested at that point. Then the first teaser trailer came out. It was the perfect build up of tension similar to that of ""Insidious"" and some classic horror movies I will mention later. I wanted to see this movie. The official full length trailers were nice and creepy too. Now onto the review. <br/><br/>Not only is this a great horror movie, but it is a great movie in general. Many have compared parts of the film to ""The Amityville Horror"". Some have said it like it is a bad thing. But you have to remember that the investigators of this movie also investigated the real life Amityville house. The similarities are a nice touch in my opinion. But honestly, this movie makes Amityville look like a Disney movie. The characters in the movie are REAL. They make you care for them. You start to feel like these people are friends of yours or distant relatives while watching the movie. When things start to happen to them at night, you feel like you are experiencing it with them. This is something that is hard for a horror movie to do. Usually you just want to see the scary stuff happen to the people and watch certain characters die. The actors and actresses all do a wonderful and believable job. The music is very unsettling in a great horror movie way. This movie made me feel like a kid again being scared of the 'unknown' entities in the dark. Those are still creepy thoughts even as a grown up after watching a movie like this. There is creepy tension echoed throughout the film. The movie also manages to have some of the scariest images seen. When the apparitions finally reveal themselves, I started to cover my eyes like a child. There is something about the way James Wan directs these images. An image of an old woman ghost slowly floating over you. You have to see it to know exactly what I'm talking about. I honestly jumped in terror more than a few times. Something that rarely happens for me. There is even the typical James Wan aspect of the film featuring evil dolls. The first part of the movie has a lot of build up and some rather jumpy scary scenes. The final part of the movie is very intense with its scare value without turning into another mindless horror movie. Don't take your eyes off the screen or you'll miss some of the more subtle and creepy scary moments. There are seriously moments that will definitely keep children and some adults up at night. There is a perfectly set up scene involving a maid that is proof you can scare an audience without cutting someone up. <br/><br/>This movie will remind you of Insidious too with its style of directing, but this movie is also more of a traditional movie with many elements of horror. But honestly, this movie surpassed Insidious greatly with its scare value. This is undeniably James Wans best movie to date. This film can go on great horror movie lists along side ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", and ""A Nightmare On Elmstreet"" etc. I can see this movie becoming a hit at the box office as well. There is even a slight chance that this movie might be the first horror movie in a long time to be recognized at the Oscars....maybe! Dare I say it? This movie is scarier than ""The Exorcist""! But that's just my opinion!<br/><br/>See it in theaters if you have the chance! If not, then rent or buy it! Turn off the lights and get ready to be frightened."
"Blonde2291","3","50","88","13 August 2013"," A basic haunted house horror movie
","The Conjuring is a horror movie supposedly based on a true story. The story begins when the Perron family moves into a farmhouse in Burrilville in 1971. Many mysterious and frightening events soon follow. Fearful and surprised, they contact the Warren couple who have reportedly captured many demons and ghosts successfully before. After some inspection Warrens conclude that this is a powerful witch who is haunting the farm area including the house. Further analysis of the situation makes them realize that they immediately need an exorcism of the house. An application is sent to the Vatican for approval. But events take a different turn and Warrens have to start the exorcism of Mrs. Perron, whom the witch has possessed, without delay. As usual, the witch does not want to leave, speaks in Latin, levitates and tries to kill them by moving objects. But in the end, Warrens, like they have done so many times before, take over the powerful witch and condemn her to hell.<br/><br/>The story is based on true events, only if you take Warren's word for it. This movie gave me an impression that I am watching an episode of Supernatural TV show, only there were no wisecracking brothers. There are no special effects that have not been shown in other movies before. Most of the scary things happen in the dark only for a few seconds and nothing much is really visible. This is your average haunted house horror movie, nothing special about it."
"poochiewoochie","1","19","30","17 January 2014"," They spent 9 years in this house
","But one has to wonder why they did after seeing this movie and all that happened to them. If I moved into a house where my kids were terrorized and I became possessed by an evil entity I sure as heck wouldn't stay there 9 years. I say this because one of the Perron girls has stated that even though the movie did take SOME liberties most of what happened did happen. So is the movie just a condensed version of what happened or did these things actually happen in such a short time frame where the kids did not age and afterward they continued to live in a place were such ""horrible"" things happened.<br/><br/>Most of the ""history"" that the Warrens mention in the movie is bull****. The real Bathsheeba or whatever the heck her name was lived to a ripe old age and died after her husband. There was no witch or child sacrifice according to records. The boy in the video they showed that was possessed was never possessed and from what I understand he and his brother are suing or sued Lorraine Warren in 2008.<br/><br/>When all is said and done one has to remember that the Warrens were also involved in that fraud called The Amityville Horror so take any movie based on their records with a grain of salt. As for the Perron daughter she wrote a book on the subject so don't believe her either. Mainly because they lived there for 9 years. The paranormal has become such a huge business lately and the more demons you throw into the mix the more people want to see or read it.<br/><br/>I bought this on ebay. Put it back on ebay the same day I received it. Don't waste your money. If you must see it wait till it's in the $5 bin at Walmart which should be soon."

"Chakka5","1","57","110","29 August 2013"," Worst ad for the Catholic Church ever
","At no point was this movie scary. Every moment was entirely predictable. If a scary movie is not scary then what is it besides a failure? Sure it was written well enough I suppose would be the only positive to this movie. You will have to turn your brain off though, which is what they were aiming for to instill the fear of God in you, when stupid moments happen such as demons teleporting through metal. I am very certain after seeing this film that every exorcism movie is just an attempt to scare people into becoming religious. The oh so subtle nuances such as ""We're not what you would call a religious family."" ""You might want to change that."" and at the end of the movie, I am not sure if anyone caught this but there was a giant quote telling people to worship God and fear the Devil. Not to mention the convenience that you cannot move out of a haunted house, you need a priest to bless it. I guess the Catholic Church never grew out of the Renaissance days of forcing its need. If you think this review focused too much on the religious part then avoid this movie because they will shove it down your throat."
"thewillt08","9","69","136","24 July 2013"," Better Than Any Recent Horror Movie
","Hide and clap or clap and seek, whatever that game was it made me never want to play any version of hide and seek ever again. The Conjuring did something a horror movie hasn't been able to do in a long time. No, not scare the hell out of me but it didn't make me laugh. This movie was one of the scariest movies I have seen in a very long time. The jump scares were there but necessary and not as predictable. The story of the Warrens is one I have never heard about but the supernatural and demon possession is something I sort of believe in, and that made the movie feel more real. I really enjoyed this movie, let's see why.<br/><br/>A family is struggling on money and buys a house in the country off a bank auction. Little do they know, this house is haunted and has an awful past. When they bought the house you would think they would do the research on the history of the house but that is just me. From the mysterious leg tugs to the creepy doll that moves on its own, this movie knows how to scare. The terror and horror in this movie is overwhelming and lives up to the hype. It takes a lot to scare me in a movie and I have seen scarier movie there were many different ways this movie had an edge. <br/><br/>One of the first things I noticed was that all the characters looked pale. The opening scene is a side story with a few girls who are being terrorized by an old doll. Not only was the doll creepy but the poor girls looked terrible. There was no pigmentation in their face. In fact no character, even the Warrens had much color in their face. All the clothes the characters wore were dull colors and they were not vibrant. Almost every scene was dark. Even when the sun was out, it was cloudy and there were shadows everywhere. That was something I noticed early and it was the same throughout the entire movie and it made the movie scarier.<br/><br/>The scariest scene is easily when the mother plays hide and clap or whatever that game was called. Yes, I was too scared to remember, okay, don't judge me. Everything in this scene worked. The scared mother made the scare more believable and the acting she did. The music blended in well. The idea of turning on the lights is used a lot but it always works. She is running around the house trying to find the ghost and the jumps and spooks were great. The theater jumped and screamed at the end of the scene which ended in darkness and terror.<br/><br/>The major flaw in most horror movies is the acting. The acting in this movie, however, is actually pretty good. The family that is haunted has five kids and a few of them are stereotypical but they all do a good job. They each have a scene or two where they shine in their moment of terror. If they are scared then the audience is scared and the movie works. Seeing one of the youngest daughters sleep walk and bang her head against the closet was creepy and of course the entire movie starts with normal occurrences that are creepy and quickly elevate.<br/><br/>Was this movie perfect? No, there were some scenes where the movie slowed down and got a little out of hand. There are scenes that are supposed to be scary but aren't and they were hard to believe. The key to a movie like this is the backstory and the ""based on a true story"" gimmick. The Warrens are real people who were paranormal investigators but there were parts of this movie where this could not have possibly been real. There were times where I was taken out of the movie because a girl was being dragged by her hair because of a ghost or something. It is hard to make a scene like that work because it looks silly. <br/><br/>The characters of the Warrens themselves were unexpected. The movie focused on them just as much as it did on the family that was being haunted. The Warren's have a daughter of their own which was unexpected and she gets involved in a creepy scene as well. They had really good chemistry but their acting was a little weak at times. The Conjuring was a good time and I had fun with the movie but I don't think I would see it again. I think it only has the real effect once. <br/><br/>Overall The Conjuring is a very good horror movie. Is that really saying much? Well, you tell me. I'm not a huge fan of horror movies. They are usually poorly made and cheap, but this one was different. It didn't rely on jump scares and cheesy tricks, but rather clever movements with the camera and limited CGI. The presentation of this movie was great and the writing clever. The backstory to this movie interesting and I bought it. I believe things like this happen but the movie needs to exaggerate it to make money and a good movie. I usually hate horror movies and laugh at them but this one was different. I was legitimately scared and I had fun. The scare wasn't constant and it wasn't there long but it was there. Some movies the scare is always there but in this movie it was here in bursts. For being the scariest movie I have seen in a long time it gets the WillyT Scaredy Pants Award. That's my horror genre rating so it also gets the WillyT Recommendation."
"jcbutthead86","10","19","32","6 March 2014"," An Excellent,Scary,Terrifying And Suspenseful Supernatural Horror Film. James Wan At His Best.
","The Conjuring is an excellent,scary and suspenseful Supernatural Horror film that combines amazing direction,a great cast,non-stop terror and a creepy,intense score elements that make The Conjuring a great Horror film and is James Wan at his best.<br/><br/>Based on a true story and set in 1971,The Conjuring tells the story of Carolyn and Roger Perron(Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston)who along with their five daughters have moved into a new house on the countryside of Rhode Island. While the Perron's are in their new house,the family discovers that the them and the house are being haunted by ghosts and evil spirits. With nowhere to turn,the Perron's ask for the help of Lorraine and Ed Warren(Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson),paranormal investigators to get rid of the evil spirits and save their family.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is an amazing and frightening Supernatural Horror film that right from the beginning puts viewers on edge giving people a scary and emotional experience that no one will ever forget. The Conjuring is also an old school Horror movie in the truest sense because it's a movie that takes us back to the Supernatural Horror films of the 1970s and 80s combining a ghost story with a demonic possession story mixing together and combining elements of classics such as The Shining(1980),Poltergeist(1982),The Haunting(1963)with The Exorcist(1973)and The Evil Dead(1982). And While The Conjuring doesn't nessarily reinvent the Supernatural Horror sub genre,the movie gives a fresh and entertaining take on the haunted house genre. Another thing the is old school about The Conjuring is the movie's scares and suspense which are effective and done with great timing and detail with intense build-up that grabs you by the throat. Director James Wan uses simple things to make the film creepy whether it's someone or something knocking on wood,moving doors,showing things from a distance giving viewers a sense of dread. The jump scares are not just in The Conjuring because it's a Horror movie but are in the film because they have meaning and power. Another thing that I love about The Conjuring is the way the movie uses atmosphere to make the movie scary using the darkness,haunting sounds and the characters reactions to the chaos going on all around which adds to the film's dark tone and the movie works greatly without blood and gore(although there is a couple of bloody moments in the film). Don't get me wrong while I love blood and gore in Horror movies,The Conjuring didn't need or require it because the whole film is about messing with you mentally than physically. You can almost say that The Conjuring is a continuation of James Wan's other haunted house movie before this one the terrific Insidious which shares some similarities with this film. At 112 minutes The Conjuring moves at a steady pace and there is never a dull moment and when watch the film you will be craving for more. One of the great things about The Conjuring is that this film is more of a character driven Horror movie like The Exorcist,Poltergeist or The Sixth Sense because with The Conjuring there is enough time and length for viewers to get to know the main characters in the Warren's and Parron's. While we don't get to know about the past history of the two couples but we see enough to feel sympathy for the Warren's and Parron's because when the scary stuff starts to happen we want them to survive. What makes the Warren's and Parron's great characters is that they don't feel like Slasher movie stock characters waiting to get killed off in the first 15 minutes but feel like real people dealing with a drastic situation. I love that the movie takes it's time with build-up not only with the scares and suspense but also with the characters which in my opinion makes the movie effective and makes The Conjuring a great and remarkable film. The ending of The Conjuring is terrific,scary and at the same time surprising because it's open ended leaving viewers with questions rather than answers.<br/><br/>The cast is outstanding. Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson are excellent and memorable as Lorraine and Ed Warren,the paranormal investigators. Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston are brilliant as Carolyn and Roger Parron,the couple who's house is haunted. Shanley Caswell(Andrea),Hayley McFarland(Nancy),Joey King(Christine),Mackenzie Foy(Cindy),Klya Deaver(April)and Sterling Jerins(Judy Warren)do wonderful jobs as the kids in the film. Shannon Kook(Drew)and John Brotherton(Brad)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by James Wan is brilliant and stylish,with Wan always moving the camera with tracking shots,hand-held movements and creative angles giving the movie a creepy and frightening atmosphere. Great job,Wan.<br/><br/>The score by Joseph Bishara is terrific,haunting and intense and matches the movie's scary energy. Memorable score,Bishara.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love Horror Films,Supernatural movies or James Wan,I highly suggest you see The Conjuring,an excellent,scary and suspenseful Horror film that is James Wong at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

"samjbar2","4","25","45","8 September 2013"," As an avid fan of horror, I found this extremely disappointing.
","OK, to begin with, I have been a member of this site for six years, and only come on to review something if I think it's utterly amazing. This movie has such a high rating that I felt like it was time to toss in my two cents, and for the first time because of how BAD a film was, particularly when considered in light of how GOOD it's SUPPOSED to be. And I am not just going to bash on it; I have thought out reasons for why I disliked it.<br/><br/>I do in fact think that the lead actress (whom I enjoy in other things as well) did a good job in her role. I find it pertinent to mention that I am, was, and always will be willing to give movies a chance which have been ""done before,"" plot-wise. For instance, I think the plot of random killing of innocent folks as they try to protect themselves from within a house has been done plenty of times, including in The Strangers - but I still thoroughly enjoyed You're Next, which is in a similar vein. I also in no way shape or form demand that a horror movie be extreme in its delivery for it to be genuinely scary or worthwhile. Session 9, for example: fantastic in my opinion, with very little blood. The original Pulse, as well. Although that one's not scary the entire time, there are some scenes that really unnerved me.<br/><br/>With these precursors, I'll continue with what I think are some legitimate drawbacks in this new possession blockbuster.<br/><br/>First of all, I do not understand the R rating.<br/><br/>No one dies. No one gets seriously hurt. Unless I'm mistaken, no one even swears in this movie - which again, does not MAKE a movie for me, I'm not 10 years old - but let's face it, the way that people talked even as far back as the '70s (the time period in which this is supposed to take place), people simply were not that squeaky clean with their rhetoric. Normally I'd be able to look past this because it's neither here nor there as far as the story goes, but it just seems to throw the vibe off a bit for me considering the lack of physical danger that the characters find themselves in. Or don't, I suppose. Which leads me to my biggest problem with this movie.<br/><br/>I, for one, did not feel a sense menace when it comes to the evil which plagues the characters. Maybe I'm jaded, maybe I've seen one too many horror movies, but it just wasn't there for me.<br/><br/>In the beginning, I gave it a chance as I do everything else.<br/><br/>By the time the first 75 minutes ran out, I was beginning to wonder if there would be ANYTHING that would truly make me feel as if these people were in danger. Personally, I found myself feeling disappointed.<br/><br/>To be clear, that does not mean that if I were in that situation and saw a girl who was definitely possessed, tweaking, and causing supernatural occurrences that I wouldn't see that as dangerous; particularly if one considers spiritual danger. My point is that I never felt like the characters were in any PHYSICAL danger. If there were more attached to legitimize the spiritual elements of terror maybe I could've gotten into it, but it seemed like the same regurgitated crap that only bible thumpers and closed-minded religionists would find scary. As proof of as unbiased of an opinion as possible, I'll state that I intensely enjoyed and was scared at certain points by both the Exorcism of Emily Rose AND the original Exorcist, despite the fact that I'm not even a Christian.<br/><br/>And to elaborate on those statements, I suppose I'd like to add that frankly the evil they face didn't seem all that powerful. Sure, there's some of the typical fare for movies like this (i.e. creepy faces, etc.), but in reiteration, nobody gets hurt really whatsoever. Most of what happens to Lili Taylor's character is a bunch of writhing around and stuff floating as far as that's concerned, nothing more.<br/><br/>It's for these reasons that I'm downright astounded that this movie got and has RETAINED a 7 star rating on IMDb, which I generally trust. Hell, it's the reason I went and saw this two hour disappointment. I'm not sure anyone will read this review, but it's definitely geared toward huge fans of horror. Trust me, if you really know what a good horror movie is, you'll think this one sucks. At most, it'll leave a bland taste in your mouth."

","A horrible, hideously cliché exorcism movie. The ""true story"" based plot could not save this movie from B actors and eye-roll-inducing jump scares. It was great comedy, however. It starts off with a typical, all-smiles Caucasian family. They move into a new, demon-possessed mansion. In fact, let's have a bonus round of sorts, with how much it resembled Dark Skies.* *Birds crashing against the house, girl knocking her head against an object, little kid seeing their own personal ghosts. And the cellar, don't get me started on the stereotypical ""dark, creepy"" cellar. I think this movie was marketed toward teens who are easily scared.

Another creepy film in which keeps horror with yet another haunted house that causes creepy goings-on in a family such as the followings classic pictures : the original ¨Exorcist¨ film (by Friedkin) that spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as ¨Changeling¨ (by Peter Medak), ¨Amytiville ¨(by Stuart Rosemberg) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Supernatural terror plenty of weird phenomenon , frights , scary beings , shocks , and eerie happenings . It deals with the Perron family formed by father (Ron Livingston) , mother (Lili Taylor , she researched The exorcist (1973) to prepare for her role) and five children move into an old house . Eight generations of families lived and died in the house before the Perrons moved in , but little do they know that the house is haunted . And some of the spirits from the families never left , deaths include two documented suicides, a poisoning death, the rape and murder of an 11-year old girl, two drownings, and the passing of four men who froze to death . Most deaths occurred within the Arnold family from which the nasty ghoul Bathsheba Sherman was descended . Paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson , this movie marks the third collaboration between James Wan and Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) work to help the family terrorized by a dark presence and ghastly mysteries in their farmhouse . There are three phases in this strange process : 1 : infestation , 2 : oppression and 3 : possession . They are attempting to find out the bottom of rare deeds by ways of the cellar and soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks . The mediums seek to uncover the fantastic secrets that has left a witch dangerously connected to the real world .<br/><br/>This is a haunted house movie that contains restless horror as when the invisible and threatening beings attack . It includes usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the scary entities with the ordinary ghastly shenanigans , the cracking floors , birds manifest as attackers , doors suddenly slam , screeching shouts , violent hitting , among others . Tension , creepy atmosphere , genuine chills , suspense is continued and appear lurking and menacing into dining room , hallway , basement and rooms . Great loads of screams , shocks , exploitation and terror abound with the usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the scary entities . It's recreated with magnificent make-up and high grade plethora special effects which are frightening and horrifying the spectator . Based on real events , in fact Lorraine Warren and Andrea Perron served as consultants to director James Wan and the screenwriters , they both claim the movie is accurate to the real story of what happened to the Perrons during the 10 years they lived in the farm house ; as they investigated the Perrons' Rhode Island farmhouse in 1973 and 1974 . The film was given an R rating by the MPAA . The MPAA said simply that the film was so scary that there were no cuts or edits possible that would make it a viable PG-13 film ; the filmmakers did not want to alter the film's tone and accepted the R-rating without any appeals . The movie broke box office records after bringing in a total of $41 million at the box office during its opening weekend . It stands as the third highest grossing opening weekend for an R-rated horror film behind Paranormal Activity 3 (2011) and Hannibal (2001). The Conjuring made a total of $137 million at the box office. <br/><br/>Eerie musical score by Joseph Bishara creating a spooky atmosphere ; not only marks the second film composer Joseph Bishara has scored a James Wan film, but it is the second time he has played a demon figure for Wan , as he portrays the demon embodiment of Bathsheba Sherman and previously played a lipstick-faced demon in Insidious (2010). Dark as well atmospheric cinematography by John R. Leonetti who modeled the film's cinematography and atmosphere after vintage 1970s horror films. The film was well directed by James Wan and it was shot in just a few weeks . Wan is an expert writer and filmmaker on terror genre as he has demonstrated in ¨Saw¨ saga , ¨Dead silence¨, among others . James Wan also directed his biggest success ¨Insidious¨ equally starred by Patrick Wilson and similar technician team , cameraman : John Leonetti and musician : Joseph Bishara . And of course , it was followed by ¨Insidious Chapter 2¨ . Furthermore , producers are preparing ¨Insidious 3¨ and ¨The Conjuring 2: The Enfield Poltergeist¨."

'Cause that's all that it was..... (Based on a true story? Ha! Spare me!) <br/><br/>And, if you view holy sanctimony in a similar way as I do, then The Conjuring will surely leave you more than just a little tiffed by its completely demented, over-the-top exorcism-rubbish, as well as its totally insulting, self-righteous, religious overtones..... (This film's final mini-sermon on religious faith was truly despicable beyond words) <br/><br/>When it came to its scare-tactics - From one utterly predictable ""thud & creak"" sequence to the next (ho-hum!), The Conjuring's story whole-heartedly gave complete license over to those of the Catholic faith and permitted these saintly ones to claim ""hauntings"" as being ""their"" territory, and their territory alone. (Yeah! So, like, lay off, you F.N. heathens!) <br/><br/>In The Conjuring's story - Ed & Lorraine are 2 real goody-goody, paranormal ""Supers"" who ""faith""-fully get down to yet another performance of a Vatican-approved exorcism. And, together, this dynamic-duo work like-the-devil to rid the plagued Perron home of its diabolically demonic possession.<br/><br/>If you ask me, I thought that ""Supers"" Ed & Lorraine were about as hilariously insincere and unconvincing as you could possibly imagine.<br/><br/>Like, I really wonder how much money these 2 charlatans-for-god charged for their ""services"" as frickin' ghost-busters. You certainly can't expect me to believe for a minute that they actually offered their ""super""-natural assistance out of the sheer kindness of their Catholic-hearts and that they received no monetary gain out of it.<br/><br/>And, besides all of that, I certainly thought that it was just a little too convenient (and not to mention, a total ""blessing-from-above"") that the Warrens just happened to live but a hop-skip-and-a-jump away from the Perrons.<br/><br/>It really killed me when paranormal ""Super"", Lorraine fell through the false wall on the 2nd floor of the Peron's house. And from there she went crash-banging down, about 30 feet, to the basement's hard, concrete floor without sustaining any real injuries to speak of.... Wow!..... (Now you know why I call her & Ed ""Supers""!) <br/><br/>All-in-all - The Conjuring was an ultimate mess of exorcism-movie clichés that sucked to heaven and hell, and beyond. And after you see the utter nonsense that this film expects one to swallow and accept at face value, I guarantee that it'll make a true disbeliever out of you, as it did me.<br/><br/>P.S. - I thought that this film's opening sequence with the ugly ""Annabellle"" doll to be one of the most absolutely under-handed bits of sucker-bait ever foisted on a movie-audience, ever."

The family finds a hidden basement which the entrance is locked with planks. Soon they are haunted by noises and ghosts and Carolyn meets the famous paranormal investigators Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson).

Their further investigation shows that a witch has sacrificed her seven-day baby to Satan and has possessed other mothers that lived in the real estate to kill their children. Lorraine and Ed bring his friends Drew (Shannon Kook) and Brad (John Brotherton) to help them to collect evidences to convince the Church that it is necessary an exorcism to save The Perron family from evil.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" is the scariest movie of haunted house and exorcism that I have seen in years and the best horror movie after ""Insidious"". The director James Wan, from ""Insidious"", makes another great horror movie using the usual clichés of the genre but with high quality.

Patrick Wilson, from ""Insidious"", switches position and now performs a paranormal investigator instead of a haunted family man. The magnificent camera work is impressive with unusual angles.

","I love horror films and I think a true horror film should be rated R. Unfortunately, over the years, the makers of films have tried their hardest to make everything they can into a PG-13 film, for reasons I cannot quite explain. As if there are that many 13 to 16 year old's whose parents will not take them to an R rated film to doom a good film to failure without them. Well this film is proving that they are not needed! For that I salute this movie and wish for its continued success. However, at the same time I am baffled as to why it is exactly doing so well. I went to this film and I have to say about the only haunted house cliché they were missing in this film was a cat scare. I was bored for a lot of this film to be quite honest. This film had some interesting story aspects and it also picked up near the end, but I just do not see what the fuss is about.<br/><br/>The story has a couple moving into a new house with their five daughters. Meanwhile, we are introduced to another couple who investigate paranormal activities. The family who moved into the new house seem to be coming under attack by a spirit and soon the paths will cross as the ones who investigate the paranormal come to the aid of the family. Things become dire when the mother of the family begins to act oddly and the strange presence that is tormenting the family finds its way into the home of the couple who investigate the strange happenings.<br/><br/>The acting is fairly decent which helped the film out immensely. As I said, I was getting bored here and there and it was only the acting that kept me awake. The scares were the typical loud noises in the night and at times I was reminded of various other haunting films such as Poltergeist, Amityville and a myriad of others. The film switches a bit in tone and turns into more of an exorcism movie, but that has been done before too in Amityville II: The Possession.<br/><br/>I do not want to give the impression that the film was bad, just a movie I have seen on more than one occasion. I find it strange that people are calling it original. It had good acting though and there were aspects of the story I enjoyed and thought interesting. To often though I felt that they used the book of haunted house clichés and were crossing off the ones they used. Like I said, I think they crossed off everyone, but were not able to cross off ""Open door and cat jumps out."""

And I am ignoring the plot holes, because they're almost unavoidable in horror movies and they weren't awful or distracting like some.<br/><br/>What makes a horror movie scary is if it could happen to you or you at least think it could. Jump scares, as are typical nowadays, are fun and I like them, but they do not make the movie. They should be added in to please those who want them and make things more exciting, but loud music/sound effects surprising you does not cause fear. And neither does making the ghosts over the top.<br/><br/>Okay, I guess I'll say what the film did well first. <br/><br/>They didn't show too much, which is good for building that creepy atmosphere, even though the atmosphere was lacking in other ways. The ghosts or demons were not shown very frequently, and when they were it still wasn't too clear, so it could still seem spooky. That's the one thing I think they did right, that a lot of movies (ie Mama) don't. And, unlike most religious horror movies, they did not make the religious people seem like nuts, so they did not ruin the story. Often religious characters are so unlikeable and illogical that they take away from the rest of it, but the characters in this were pretty decent, and you do hope that they conquer their haunted house and everyone makes it out okay. Which also leads to the actors, the main adult characters were all well acted. The kids and side/beginning characters not so much, but whatever.<br/><br/>That said, it still wasn't very strong. It didn't feel genuinely creepy because it went too far. You don't get the sense of foreboding, instead the ghostly activity is happening all the time, and they are not realistic enough to cause real scares. There is no build up for the scares, they are constant, and that makes them leave a lot less of an impact. Even the sort of silly scares can work if its built up to them enough and isn't overdone (like in the first Paranormal Activity). <br/><br/>I know horror movies aren't known for the realism, but it needs to feel like it could happen to be scary, at least in my opinion, and I'm not sure why so many people are giving this movie such good reviews because of it. Never in my life have I feared having chairs thrown at me from across the room by demons, or myself being thrown across the room. Nor have I feared demonic earthquakes that destroy everything, or someone in my family being possessed and floating around and sitting on the ceiling. Nor being burnt and killed if I walked out of my house. Witches are hardly scary on their own. This one even had floating guns that shoot at you and try to kill you. Guns are scary, but because of the people that use them, not because ghosts are going to steal them and kill you. If it could never happen and is over the top, it makes it ridiculous and silly rather that scary. It's little things that could be coincidental or could be your imagination that are really creepy, leading up to the big moments at the end. <br/><br/>It also had typical inconsistencies to fit the plot that are a bit annoying. For example the girls wake up when they hear a thudding (the sister sleep walking) but a large amount of glass breaking making an unusually loud crashing sound right outside of the bedrooms doesn't wake up anyone. The camera angles and the soundtrack were sometimes unfitting.<br/><br/>If you're a horror fan as I am, you'll probably enjoy watching this, but it isn't likely to leave a lasting impression."

","This is, without a doubt, one of the most overrated films I've come across in many years.<br/><br/>For me, the film relied far too much on jump scares rather than the actual story: it took about 60 minutes until it got going. The acting was mediocre, and I say that because I didn't feel sympathetic for the characters. Personally, I preferred Vera Farmiga (Lorraine Warren) in 'Orphan' as opposed to 'The Conjuring' - I feel as if she was wasted a bit here.<br/><br/>I never really got the director's intentions in this film and I feel there could have been more of a story to it. Films such as 'Martyrs' and 'Sinister', which I'd highly recommend, were both able to attach an equal amount of weight to the story as well as the horror.<br/><br/>As for the ending, it was extremely weak. In fact, it was pathetic. I think the conclusion could have been dealt with much better.<br/><br/>The film was okay, and I can definitely say I've seen worse horror films in my life, but I honestly can't see how people can rate it anything above 7. It just didn't do it for me, personally. I expected much more ""horror"".<br/><br/>A good film? Yes. A good ""horror"" film? Not at all."

","After the first 20 minutes i realised that i had seen this film before a number of times but under different names. This may have been based on a true story but that story has been done so many times before that it's just tired and predictable. I fell to sleep after about 30 minutes of this movie (a first for me at the cinema) and i think that sums it up. As i have to write a minimum of 10 lines to get this review on IMDb i would like to ask how this film has a 7.9 rating? Are people involved with the movie (the marketing team) posting positive reviews to get the rating up or have most people out there genuinely never seen a horror movie like this?

","I was anxiously waiting for The Conjuring to come out. Especially after the trailer was released. And here start the problems with this movie: the trailer is scarier than the actual movie.<br/><br/>The trailer involves the actual real family, much adding to the ""based on a true story"" gimmick. The problem with this is that it raises an expectation that we'll actually see real details in the movie. There's plenty of people filming events during the movie, and you're left with a feeling of ""if this was a real paranormal investigation, the only reason for not using real footage is that it's all fake"".<br/><br/>The only time the real family comes into the picture is a couple of family photos, on the end credits.<br/><br/>As other users have mentioned, the ghost scenes are highly exaggerated, way too violent, again contributing to the overall disappointment of what was supposed to be a ""real"" ghost story.<br/><br/>So after you get used to the idea that this is just another lame ghost movie, you're left with half decent performances from Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, and you're left sighing for Insidious.<br/><br/>There's basically one scary scene in the movie, the hide-and-seek+clap game.

","Haunted house/demon possession tale, allegedly based upon the exploits of real-life ""paranormal investigators"" Ed and Lorraine Warren, whose supernatural findings at one such house allegedly inspired the book ""The Amityville Horror"" (just as this film was obviously inspired by everything from ""The Exorcist"" to ""Poltergeist""). It's another screaming-Mimi, targeted at audiences with amnesia. The highly-derivative James Wan directed; he borrows (or rather, steals) from so many other films, his picture is like a vulture in a graveyard--picking clean the bones of cinema's past. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play the Warrens, here attempting to drive out the demon who's stirring up trouble in the farmhouse of a Rhode Island family in the early 1970s. Lili Taylor has the Linda Blair role here; she gets to spin upside while tied to a chair, vomit up blood through a bed sheet and speak in a guttural voice, ""You're all going to die!"" If there were any cinematic justice, this movie would have been laughed out of early screenings--but, astonishingly, it garnered some positive reviews from professional critics and attained a sizable audience.

","Directed by James Wan (Insidious, Saw, Dead Silence), The Conjuring is set in America during the 1960's. We follow the 'real' case-files of paranormal investigators The Warrens, who work against supernatural elements trying to possess the living, in this case the Perron family. The Warrens face a terrifying battle against a demon unwilling to leave...<br/><br/>One thing you can expect from a James Wan film is quality, with an impressive collection of horror titles behind him, disappointment was never an option. Unlike many supernatural films of late (Paranormal Activity, Grave Encounters) this film presents a nostalgic era before technology ruled the home roost (and the horror film), when a lonesome haunted house out in the sticks, and a creative eye for fear could hold the audience. The film creates a haunting atmosphere set around childhood themes; using games, toys and innocence to project the violence of this sinister entity. The POV of both families fighting 'evil' offers a variety of encounters and experiences, in a film that may have been less engaging otherwise. Although there is the usual line- up of jumps, Wan includes his own touch of originality making you leave your seat a few times. <br/><br/>The reveal is always a tense moment in a ghost film, The Conjuring manages to keep it together unlike many others (Mama). However, the reveal always seems a needless element, as the presence of the ghost is enough to create the fear, and putting a face to a ghost is unnecessary. The solid acting of the cast should be noted, along with a well written script with moments of comic relief, but don't get too comfy, as Wan will pack a punch to those unsuspecting. An example of how ghost films should be; packed full of jumps, and minus the showcase of evolving technology that captures 'found' footage. Wan conjures (yes) a decent horror full of childhood nostalgia and things that go bump in the night. <br/><br/>After all we all have that one childhood story that still keeps us 'adults' awake some nights... mine was the attic hatch in my room...<br/><br/>www.horrortrunk.com"
"phizzle21","3","2","2","2 December 2019"," ""You did good!"" ""No, you did!"" - The Conjuring
","(3 out of 10 stars, very minor spoilers only)<br/><br/>To my shock, this is exactly what the Warrens say to each other at the end of this movie after everything is over. Without a bit of irony to it. As if they had just rescued a cat from a tree and not performed a ridiculously over-the-top exorcism. It is probably also what James Wan and his screenwriter said to each other, when they finished making this film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, they did not!<br/><br/>Instead, they served us this overly long, sub-standard and by-the-book haunted-house-movie (based of course on a true story, yaaawn...) that is bloated by unnecessary side plots and filled to the brim with jump scares and stupid decisions from the film's characters. Worse of all, the movie fails to deliver on its main purpose: it is not scary.<br/><br/>The film suffers from a lot of over explanation. It starts already with the unnecessary opening sequence about the two dim-witted nurses that invite an evil spirit to possess the Anabelle Doll (well, sequels and spin-offs need to be seeded early on, right?). During the film, all the characters keep describing what they see and do which takes a lot away from the tension and is just, well, boring. On top of that, we are bombarded with pages of text, informing us that the Warrens are real-life-characters and that the depicted events are all so true. This is intended to up the believability and the scariness but it is just annoying.<br/><br/>For 1,5 hours, the moviemakers keep flooding the viewer with all available horror clichés. If you just a little well-versed in haunted-house films, you have seen it all. We have a remote house whose previous owners suffered a terrible fate. Only this time, they kind of multiply this device. There is a witch, a girl who committed suicide on the orders of someone, dead children, a woman who hang herself... I have to admit that I kind of lost track, because I did not care. Somehow, they all come back to haunt the family, though to me, it is never clear, what exactly they want. Only the dog senses that there is something wrong and - you guessed it - ends up dead. We have creepy children's toys. Hidden cellars. Spaces in between the walls. Loads of cobweb. Children's games (hide and seek in a haunted house, anyone?). Whispers. Sleepwalking. Birds, lots of them. I cannot be bothered to list all the tropes; others have done it already.<br/><br/>To make it worse, the director relies heavily on jump scares. Only, you see all of the coming from miles away, so they do not work. We hear weird noises, doors keep opening and closing on their own, people keep suddenly appearing, it is just all so tiresome.<br/><br/>There is no mystery as, right from the start, you know that the dead people are somehow still there and up to no good. The characters even talk about it all the time.<br/><br/>Wan and his writer keep weaving in all these additional characters, when it is already impossible to keep all the daughters of the family apart. The throwaway cop, the useless assistant, the Warren's maid and their daughter. Give me a break, the movie is already confusing enough.<br/><br/>With the Warrens moving in, they go all Home-Alone on the ghosts, with their camera booby traps and microphones. This is de-mystifying to a degree, it is kind of funny.<br/><br/>To complain about how stupid the characters behave would be crying over spilled milk. It might seem like we have to get used to this behavior in modern horror films, but I am just not willing to accept it. When you see a dead girl's ghost with slit wrists in a very dark room, whispering ""Look what you made me do..."", what would you do? Well, our throwaway cop decides to run right towards her. This is very exemplary for how the characters in this film act.
The finale is just so over the top, it is ridiculous. A lot of screaming and people flying through the air. It was really, well, boring.<br/><br/>I think this film made me realize that I just do not like haunted movies. I just keep wondering what these ghosts want. Why do they always slowly but gradually start to terrorize our heroes without harming them, opening and closing doors and doing all their boo-stuff. Why can they not just do their job and kill everybody right away, if this is what they want? Maybe they just want to see people suffer in the process. Well, I guess James Wan is my haunting ghost then.<br/><br/>Final question: Did anyone notice any conjuring in the movie?"
"eric262003","7","2","2","8 September 2014"," A Very Fun, But Standard Horror Film
","Usually horror films that claim are actually based on true events, you try your hardest to suspend any kind of scepticism in hopes that there's some form of truth lurking around. In the realms of the supernatural in horror films, I feel there is no need to spoon-feed our audiences any further than offering the material you have in front of our eyes. Are the situations faced in these stories real? There's a possible chance it may be. Is the story itself accurate? More often, they are not. ""The Conjuring"" directed by James Wan focuses on a haunted house story and delivers us some powerful, but mundane scares that exceeds above other movies, though the quality is quite lacklustre. <br/><br/>The opening ploy involving a possessed doll paves the way open to our leading heroes, a pair of paranormal investigators Ed and Leslie Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), the story turns its attention to the Perron family lead by Roger and Carolyn (Ron Livingston and Lilli Taylor) who in 1971 move into a condemned farmhouse in Rhode Island with their five daughters and their dog, Sadie. No sooner than they settle in which strange eerie stuff manifests within their surroundings as secret passageways start to unravel and the dog becoming very suspicious, refuses to even come into the house. The hauntings are thrown at them left,right and centre as mysterious bruises appear on their skin, clocks stopping for no reason, doors open by themselves. While these things happen it never feels rushed. Once they had enough, it was time for the Perron's to call the Warren's to investigate the paranormal activities going on in their house.<br/><br/>The Warrens eventually move in with the family to seek out what kind of supernatural occurrences is bothering the Perrons so that can gain permission from the Catholic Church to see if they can possibly perform an exorcism on them. Their research leads up the forces behind these evil intentions comes from a lady named Bathsheba (Joseph Bishara) who in 1863 was claimed to be a witch was caught trying to sacrifice her young child. And the movie just carries along with one thing happening after another either cementing the side story or just simply randomizing one scare after the next until we've reached the climax. <br/><br/>What makes ""The Conjuring"" compelling was the ensemble. As surreal as the story may be at times, they're all very convincing and the emotions they bring to their audience speaks volumes louder than words. Even the daughters, who are relatively unknowns succeed in delivering emotion range that never seems either forced or contrived. When the performers feel the fear factor, the audience will feel it as well. Therefore, for a horror film I felt the performances were actually pretty good. Not Oscar worthy, but the emotional manipulation really sells itself pretty good. The other factor is the level of scares. Sure it's been done a thousand times before for better or worse, but it is quite solid in its execution. The unsettling camera with its off-kilter angles create a spectrum of uncomfortable images and situations like ghosts materializing in the mirrors, eerie whispers, and doors slamming on their own. It's been done before, but the execution here is chilling and convincing. <br/><br/>However, the scares seem to only work but only in a subtle fashion and it lacks in terms of having a deep impact on its audience. Director James Wan ignores to develop a more impacted thread that can vibrate with the audience once the end credits are finished. It's something that could be taken into consideration. With the myriad of horror remakes and sequels, it's necessary to have a scene like in ""The Exorcist"" implanted into the story. For a film that tries to go beyond the fear factor of the paranormal, ""The Conjuring"" fails miserably. The digging for evidence is only depended on mainly for the action and not very much elsewhere. And from what is given to us the Warrens' believe that the Perron's are just another case file. Where do they go after this case has zero concern for us, but some fleshing out could have made this movie a lot better. <br/><br/>In an early scene that situates the Warren's lecturing at university students as they would prefer to be either labelled as ghost hunters or kooks. I think kooks best describes them. Although it feels as though the movie was based or inspired by actual events, but suspending one's disbelief seems to be the direction this movie is going. There's a lot of traditional horror elements that these kooks won't tell."
"alexcomputerkid","8","2","2","22 August 2014"," Still though, The Conjuring is a film that works though it does lack originality.
","If you say you like horror, you would have to know James Wan. He is a director who's only made a impact since the 2000's but it's a big mark indeed. He first created Saw in 2004 which was a clever and original torture film that later turned into six more films. Dead Silence came next for him which I've never seen but it has killer dolls in the plot that comes off as original even in pre-watch. Even though more of a physiological film, he created Death Sentence in 2007 which can be described as a crime film. He went back horror in 2010 with Insidious which felt something similar to the classic Poltergeist, with a family getting haunted by a demon and Insidious 2 came in 2013.<br/><br/>With Wan announcing himself directing the next Fast and Furious, it's now safe to say that horror may be done for him and he's going in another direction. Regardless of where he's going, I'm going to support him because I am a fan of his. The Conjuring as possibly his last horror movie fits solidly into his filmography though. <br/><br/>Based off a true story and set in the 70's, a family of six with five daughters move into a country house looking for a new start and really a new chapter on life. After what seems like random noises that could be found throughout any house, the Perron family starts to notice that these aren't random noises and they later contact paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Fleming) Warren. This is a haunted house film with also some homage to the 70's and of course it's horror. <br/><br/>If you ever seen Wan's previous work, Insidious which we have talked about, then you know what the The Conjuring is. Like Insidious, The Conjuring has a family, investigators and Patrick Wilson was also in Insidious. Still though, The Conjuring is a film that works though it does lack originality. <br/><br/>The list of why this works without originality is granted very long. Setting this movie in the 70's is fresh and innovating. Ed and Lorraine are the type of characters that are very interesting and the movie has a very cool premise. These are the type of characters I could watch quite often in movies to come. Lili Taylor in particular delivers a performance that stands above them all. The movie provides many scares, at least it did for me, and for a person who doesn't get scared by many things, that's definitely saying something. I can also appreciate the smart ending here that just makes you appreciate how much James Wan knows horror. <br/><br/>With a sequel set to be put out in 2015 and spin-off film coming out the first week of October in 2014, the future of this film is far from over. It is something I am surely looking forward to. The Conjuring won't go down as Wan's best work but it won't be his worst work either. I would put it in the middle o his filmography."

","Director James Wan has really come into his own with 2013's ""The Conjuring."" He teams up again with actor Patrick Wilson (they collaborated on 2010's INSIDIOUS), to tell the story of a normal family who moved into a house in 1971, and the spirits that haunt the house and then the family. A slow unraveling of pieces to the story helps keep the audience engaged, as we find out about several historical events which have brought tortured souls back to torment the house's occupants.<br/><br/>I found this movie to be suspenseful and scary, creating empathy for an otherwise normal family who did nothing to deserve the fear that was brought onto them, other than to move into a house whose previous occupants suffered unspeakable crimes decades before.

"YourFilmWhore","7","2","2","26 February 2014"," Genre Piece Well Done While Doing Nothing New.
","Ah, the often talked about The Conjuring that is supposedly about a ""true"" story of famous demonologists and paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren that even they were too scared of to speak about and let people know about for the longest part. Now, I am not going to debate whether or not if the couple this movie is based on are con-artists, or just got conned themselves, since honestly, this movie has zip to do about Amityville minus a little mention near the end of the film. Really, this movie is about a whole other not-demonic possession that Ed and Lorraine were at and the effects that some spooky crap had on a humble family. Now, if this sounds like you have heard of this story before, well, it is because you have. Honestly, one of the fundamental issues presented to the viewer here really is that they are going to be watching this movie thinking of plenty of other haunted house films, especially The Amityville Horror and trying to see how this film stacks to them but thankfully for this movie, despite treading heavily worn tracks, it does it in a way that is not completely idiotic or hair pulling bad. In fact, the scares in this movie are quite good, and sure, there are your usual jump scares because no horror movie would be complete without them, but the movie does build up some great atmosphere and this could easily be one of the better horror films to have come out in ages...if the script was any better. Now, characters are not complete and utter fools (minus a cop who is in this movie for really no reason as far as I can tell except to have handcuffs near the end just because), but really they are given a bit too much exposition to spout, and it can really annoy anyone who doesn't like being talked down. If I wanted to know the ins and outs of paranormal investigations in the 70s, I will read a book about it instead of watching a movie that is meant to entertain me, not educate. And thanks to this really heavy handed way of telling us what things do, and sometimes whenever there is really nothing going on in parts (Ed and Lorraine disappear for nearly 20 minutes in the middle of the movie to not be heard from till the crap really hits the fan. Nice to know this was ""their"" story and they are barely featured in it) and you find yourself just really bored with the movie, bam, the plot restarts and you remember why you were bothering for the first quarter of the movie. Because of this, it is hard for me to really recommend this movie at times, especially to those who are like me, starting to grow tired of the old and worn out clichés in horror. Will you hate this utterly after watching it? No, unless horror is just not your thing (which if so, what are you bothering reading my review for? :D ). Now are you going to love this and want to own the about seven different editions that are sure to come out on DVD? Probably not. It is just a bit too bloated and long winded to truly grip, though it is really well done, and can be straight out frightening at times."

","Rather a disappointing film. Everyone talking about how great it was made us ready to be terrified and it did nothing but disappoint continuously. In the first half there were some slightly scary and weird moments, when the spirit appeared behind the mum and the doll being introduced, but from there it just kind of went down hill for a long while. The back story of what happened to the other owners being brought to life (the hangings in the garden) and the mother being exorcised had to be highlighted as the scariest moments but it was nothing that hasn't been in other horror movies plenty of times.

I have never been that disappointed...<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was quite formidable and original but after the first twenty minutes it began to spin out of control. Piece by piece The Conjuring began to display elements stolen from other horror movies. Specific scenes that even a horror rookie can associate to some of the popular horrors out there, have been implemented throughout the movie... And the number of haunted house clichés could not have been any larger.<br/><br/>I am not trying to spoil anything but the ending was completely ridiculous. Last thing you want to do is to believe that this was based on real life events....<br/><br/>The jump scares were as predictable as it gets and the plots are being twisted for no particular reason with no positive outcome in any one of them<br/><br/>The only good thing is that the movie gives you an insight into the paranormal world and does it quite effectively, I personally kind of wanted to go and read more about demonology. For this the movie receives a plus.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen many haunted house or satanic horrors, you should definitely go and see this. On the other side, if you consider yourself a person who is quite educated in the horror genre, then you will be disappointed."
"joshcooley79","1","15","30","26 July 2013"," Why so Christian?
","This is essentially a SUUUUUPER Christian remake of Poltergeist, with a thinly veiled anti-abortion message. Yeah, it has some creepy moments and for a while it even seems relatively restrained, but it eventually devolves into the same old crap that you always see in this type of formulaic horror movie. There are many, many things that are so typical that it feels like you're watching a parody of a horror movie; moments that felt as if I'd somehow stumbled into an awful Scary Movie sequel. And then it all falls apart when it becomes so terribly, unashamedly Christian... Its stance isn't even as nebulous as the pseudo-New Agey stuff in Poltergeist (which was a very light touch compared to the heavy handedness here), and even literally spells it out for the audience that both the devil and god exist. Hooey! So if you don't mind going to see a schlocky horror movie--where there is never even any real danger--and don't mind that icky feeling that you've just dropped your money into a religious propaganda machine's offering plate, then... well, you probably deserve this ultimately anticlimactic, unsatisfying, preachy tripe."
"somf","8","16","33","8 July 2013"," This will become a horror classic
","I don't want to sound like a shill for the studio but this is the truth. You don't want to wait for this one to hit DVD if you are at all a fan of the genre. The Conjuring relies a lot on things that go bump in the night and do they ever bump. It will lose a lot of its effectiveness on even the best home system. I was reminded a lot of the original Haunting by the loud sounds in the film and how they were used effectively to scare the audience. <br/><br/>Lily Taylor rises above an overall solid cast to play the mother of the haunted family and she really delivers the goods. James Wan has made his best film to date with this solid horror film that hearkens back to the ones best remembered from my childhood, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, The Haunting, and Poltergeist. Being set in the 70's really helps give it the feel of those haunted house classics. <br/><br/>The movie starts with a nice subplot piece with a couple good scares and then slows down for about a half hour or so of setup before revving up into one hell of a scare fest. I don't want to reveal too much of the plot, other than to say it sure made me curious about the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren, the investigators in the film that were also involved with the Amityville Horror. Now if the filmmakers will just let this one lie on its own and don't try to milk the idea for a series of films like was done with the other famous Warren case, things will be just about near perfect scary."

","People are out going out of their minds (even critics!) proclaiming how fantastic The Conjuring is supposed to be. Don't get me wrong, I love a good horror film; especially one that doesn't cling to the modernist jump- scare paradigm, but rather builds terror around suspense and immersively- felt danger.<br/><br/>But I will never watch this movie except out of morbid curiosity and to justify my disdain for it.

"Michael Fargo","4","15","31","24 July 2013"," The reviews led me to buy a ticket....
","...and this is the second time recently (""Cabin in the Woods"" was the other) that reading about a film overrode my better judgment. What was true about both films is they were ""different"" than the usual horror film, and for some reason viewers here/reviewers in print thinks that makes them successful.<br/><br/>For one, horror films need characters that would behave similar to what an audience member would do. Wandering into a darkened boarded-up basement--more than once--where all manner of unnatural things/sounds occur becomes at first laughable and then tedious. Two, when new rules for demon possession have to be spelled out to us in anticipation for what's surely going to happen later in the film spoils the surprise. Three, the couple who ""rescue"" the family but also keep a room full of ""possessed"" objects in a special room in their own house was so ridiculous that whatever was bound to be the consequence had me cheering for the demons.<br/><br/>Finally a film that can make Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson dull, should be shelved permanently. Unfortunately, for reasons beyond my comprehension, this film is getting rave reviews. If you want to see a truly scary movie, find Jack Clayton's ""The Innocents"" or Robert Wise's ""The Haunting,"" and leave ""The Conjuring"" alone."

And yes, it has echos of other films like Exorcist, Amityville Horror and others.<br/><br/>Well structured with thrills and mystery, it is a good film and a logical extension to the ""Paranormal"" security camera series of films to something more dramatic and with more camera angles, lighting and camera movement.<br/><br/>Enjoy."

","I thought this was a good film. It had good character development. Good story development.<br/><br/>It had suspense. It had little shockers but had a happy, conclusive ending. However, it didn't have enough visualization of the ""bad guy."" This is unfortunate, and didn't enable me to suspend my disbelief.<br/><br/>The film could have differentiated itself from the usual by having the characters turn on the lights and calling the authorities.<br/><br/>This would have added a level of credibility to the story.<br/><br/>So here is my question to the powers that be. Why do so many horror flicks have to play out in the dark? Example, the person hears something. They then choose to walk into room after room without turning on the lights, and if they do, it's the dimmest one available, never the overhead light.<br/><br/>Also, when they go into the ""evil cellar"" the light never works. But they go in anyway, because for some reason they ""have to know."" A setup like that makes me feel detached and not care about the character. It makes them look dumb.<br/><br/>In a way, wouldn't it be logical in a drama horror for that person to be offed? Lastly, why not call the EMTs?

","2.2 of 10. The acting and setting make this nearly tolerable for about the first hour. The scariest part of the film is the growing fear that the plot development is already over and the film is going nowhere with no punchline or terrifying twist. Instead, the film is actually taking itself seriously and has nothing intelligent to add to the vast array of nonsense ghost/paranormal/exorcism films.<br/><br/>The horror of this film is that if you paid to watch this, you paid to get blasted with Catholic Church advertising for their priest, blessing, baptism, and exorcism scams. Look out, there are witches and demons in everything and everywhere trying to take you and your children. Quick, call demon busters and your local catholic church.<br/><br/>This film depends heavily on the audience's own imagination and gullibility.

","The atmosphere was boring, and half of the time everyone in the theatre was laughing at the stupid scenes the actors tried to pull off. Vera Farmiga's character was terrible, which is very disappointing because i find her to be a talented actress. As for the Annabelle doll, dear god, what was the point of her? She was useless to the film.. and Joey King's character (I don't think they even mentioned her name) was pointing at nothing behind the door, which was so melodramatic, and too thought out. If she scared, why would she point it out? FOR GOD SAKES IT COULD KILL YOU WHAT ARE YOU THINKING. Don't get me started on how annoying Carolyn was. She has unexplained bruises, her dog died, was locked in a cellar, and hadn't done anything to move out before contacting the demonologists or whatever the hell they called themselves. I know all the families money was tied into that house but her daughters were sleep walking and screaming all the time! Get the hell out of there! The exorcism part was the most action in the movie, and it only lasted 5 minutes. Every other scene was boring and too slow. Dare I say it, but this movie was honestly a waste of my time. I was so excited because of all the good reviews, but damn this film was terrible. Too many subplots were unfinished and thrown in, and it ended up in an overall mess. 12 dollars thrown in the gutter. ugh."
"uncertainwonder-1","2","9","17","1 August 2013"," boring, inconsistent, and funny
","This movie is nothing more than a boring, random collection of ""creepy"" scenes. No effort is made to connect these scenes with an actual, coherent story. So in honor of that, my review will be a random collection of my thoughts on the film. No effort will be made to turn it into an actual, coherent review.<br/><br/>I get the distinct feeling that the filmmakers made a cynical bet among themselves that they could make the most derivative, stupid, self-contradictory piece of crap, and as long as it looked nice and could make you jump a little, then they would have a hit. Judging from other reviews of this film, they seem to have been correct.<br/><br/>The movie is called ""The Conjuring"" even though there is no actual conjuring that happens.<br/><br/>The first ten minutes is about a doll. It's too bad the doll has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the movie because that was the best part. <br/><br/>The movie has something to do with a nice family that moves into a nice house in nice 1971 and is terrorized by something supernatural. It might be ghosts of dead children, or ghosts of people that committed suicide, or witches, or demons, or all of them. Since the screenwriters just stole ideas from other movies and threw them into this script, they clearly didn't worry that the movie makes no sense. <br/><br/>This movie even copies ""Paranormal Activity"" (which was itself a copy of other movies). Is it a coincidence that the same guy directed both of these movies? Basically, ""The Conjuring"" is really just ""Paranormal Activity 1971"".<br/><br/>The movie is partly about Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are real people that used to hunt ghosts and demons. They are most famous for being involved in the Amityville Horror, which was discovered to be a hoax (although this movie doesn't tell you that). There is a melodramatic subplot about how they want to retire, but they love each other too much and are too committed to their mission from God, so they can't quit. And they do get to explain the supernatural events to the family with lines like, ""Sometimes when you get haunted, it's like steppin in gum—you take it with you.""<br/><br/>I learned two things from this ""true story"" - First, the women in the Salem Witch trials were actually witches, and they worshiped Satan. Second, the Pope has to approve all exorcisms, and he doesn't like to help possessed people if they aren't Catholic.<br/><br/>While watching the movie, I was trying to keep a mental list of stupid things that happened. But there were too many - I literally lost track of them. I even started laughing towards the end, because the characters seemed to have lost any contact with real life and were just running around making the dumbest decisions they possibly could.<br/><br/>There are a couple of jump scares that still worked, and the cinematography was nifty. The groovy 1971 fashion is fun. So it doesn't fail 100% of the time. Just 97% of the time."

","I haven't been this scared from a horror film in years. The Conjuring promises to freak you out, keep you on the edge of you seat, make you jump, and give you an awesome story that has elements to it that have actually happened to a family who is portrayed in the film. The actors/actresses were all great at acting. It was awesome to see Patrick Wilson in the film because of his role in Insidious...I thought it was cool that it basically tied in with that. This movie definitely gets its roots from Insidious and The Exorcist. I couldn't believe some of the jump scares they pulled off in this movie, I mean, they were so real, it seemed. I hope people learn from this movie: Horror films don't need to have gore and tons of deaths to be good, they need good scares and a good story, and this film gives you both.

","So last week, I mentioned to some friends that I had not seen a genuinely scary movie in quite some many years. I waxed on about how I missed being scared by Freddy and Jason and was thus disappointed year after year by the new horror offerings.<br/><br/>So it was suggested, by those a decade younger than I, that I partake in this particular film.<br/><br/>While I am not completely disappointed, evidenced by the fact that I was able to sit through an entire viewing without being disgusted by poor plot development, I was nonetheless met with the tired old trope of modern Christian mythology being the centerpiece of the storyline.<br/><br/>In short, if you still cling to such ridiculous beliefs, you will likely find this movie entertaining. Otherwise, pass on this title. It requires at least a rudimentary subscription to demons and afterlifes in order to make a semblance of sense.<br/><br/>I liken it to The Exorcist for that simple fact. Additionally the plot is remarkably the same as that film in that a woman, in lieu of a young girl, is the victim of a demonic possession which requires one man to ""fix her"". It sucked in 1973 just as it sucked 40 years later."

Not really. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's a nice film. The director of photography needs some form of medal made out of some sort of metal for the disorientating use of shots that leaves you feeling seriously confused and uneasy adding to the tension.<br/><br/>Hooooowever, the film is horribly paced. You go a very long time without seeing so much as a hint of a ghost child and when you are hit in the face with horror it goes on so long you either get pi**ed off with being on edge or it loses the effect.<br/><br/>The film also seems a little confused about who it's main characters are. It gives equal screen time to both the parents of the family and the investigators and it's because of this overcommitment that you end up not really having enough time to care that much about any of them. <br/><br/>Is the film scary? Yes. Will you jump? Probably. Is it any different from Insidious or Sinister? No. If anything, the smaller character focus of insidious and darker ending of sinister make them superior horror films. <br/><br/>All in all, the film is like making the dirty love with Monica from friends; It's better than the phoebe's out there but it's not the Rachel you were hoping for either."

"p-jonsson","7","3","4","16 June 2014"," Fairly good classical exorcism type horror movie
","The Conjuring is a fairly classical horror/haunted house/exorcism movie. That was pretty much what I was hoping for. Slow and creepy build up to a final outburst and confrontation with an evil entity. This is a good movie although it is not really something new in terms of story. It is fairly impossible not to think about, and make comparisons with, The Amityville Horror when seeing this movie. I do not think it really deserves the glowing 9 or 10 star ratings that I have seen but it certainly do not merit those 1 or 2 star ones either. What were these people expecting? This is a solid effort of making a movie along the classical lines of supernatural possession. As I wrote, it is not really something new, but it is nice to see a new movie using this kind of story without just turning it into a CGI gore-feast. Sure, the movie also includes the traditional pitfalls that most horror movies apparently must have like people thinking it is a good idea to walk down into the dark and scary basement all alone in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>One thing that irked me with the movie though was the idea of phantoms and performing exorcism being presented as kind of normal and accepted things. Of the movie would have played itself out 70 or so years earlier maybe but in the 1970′s? It just felt somewhat surreal to see this ""ghosthunter"" make presentations and talk to people like supernatural entities and the practice of exorcism was just things that happened.<br/><br/>The we have the ending of course. Not that it was overly bad but Christ, if you are going to do an exorcism then do it damn it. Do not stop the procedure and look lost every time something goes bump.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was not sure whether I was going to be disappointed or pleased when sitting down to watch this movie. On the whole I was pleased. It was a nice to watch a movie that was going back to the traditional values in horror movie making and it was as well implemented as one could expect."

","If you take your movies as you find them, then welcome to one of the creepiest and scariest horror films of all time. <br/><br/>Essentially a hodge-podge of a number of proved themes and tropes (the ""cursed objects"" room from the series Friday the 13th; the classic and ubiquitous haunted house theme; paranormal investigators a la Hell House and Haunting; riffs off Exorcist etc), director James Wan (of the original SAW) basically gives a clinic in the correct way to do horror. <br/><br/>It is creepy terrifying and visceral. It builds like a prizefight, subtle at first, and by the end you are in the last round of a UFC match. And you are fighting the devil.<br/><br/>As horror entertainment, it does not get much better. You will probably sleep with the light on the night you see it. Or ask your grandkids to bunk over.<br/><br/>---------------------------- <br/><br/>The other way to look at this film is to de-construct it (like Whedon did with Cabin in the Woods) and say it is rather too dependent on other people's ideas.<br/><br/>And one could also say the script was a bit muddled.<br/><br/>For example, the opening sequence starts with the young daughter of the lead paranormal investigator sneaking into the room full of cursed objects --even though she had been told not to! -- and actually ""connecting"" with one.<br/><br/>Creepy. Manipulative. And just a little gratuitous -- but this is the result of trying to cram too many movie ideas into one script.<br/><br/>The ""happy ending"" (with sunlight and soft music) is welcomed as a relief by the audience (many of whom are trying to speed-dial their pharmacist by this point in the film) but also contains logic flaws big enough to drive a truck through. <br/><br/>Once again, the movie is about results and doesn't care how it gets them.<br/><br/>Now, if you REALLY REALLY want to see a horror film that relies less on throwing the kitchen sink at the audience, and more on pure smarts, check out IT FOLLOWS, released in 2015.<br/><br/>You're welcome."
"Bravesfan17","9","10","20","8 July 2013"," Scary and chilling. I loved it!
","I am usually not one for horror movies. In fact, I am very selective when it comes to seeing or skipping horror movies. However, I do find James Wan to be a very good director. I still need to see Insidious, but the first Saw movie, which he directed, is the only good one of its franchise.<br/><br/>The film begins with two roommates being interviewed by Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) , paranormal researchers, regarding a possessed doll which they named Annabelle. This interview is shown on a film at a college seminar where the Warrens are guest speakers. The film then cuts to Roger Perron (Ron Livingston), his wife Carolyn (Lili Taylor), and their five daughters moving into a new home in the country part of Rhode Island. However, their dog Sadie refuses to enter, being suspicious of the house. Shortly after, the family notices strange things happening. Carolyn wakes up with random bruises on her body. The clocks stop at 3:07. The daughters find themselves being messed with while asleep. When the girls are scared out of their minds, Carolyn goes to the Warrens for help. They take on the job for the Perrons. While there, the Warrens look for all details of why the Perrons' house is possessed.<br/><br/>The highest praise for this film goes to director James Wan. His attention to details show here. He does a great job of sticking to the story and script. His direction of each actor from Wilson and Farmiga to Livingston and Taylor, to even the daughters works so well that he got great performances from his actor.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga knock their roles out of the park as Ed and Lorraine Warren. Wilson does great as a man who has been through a lot with past jobs regarding other paranormal research, but shows that he truly cares for the Perrons' who don't know where else to turned to. Farmiga is moving as Lorraine, who can see more into the lives of everyone else. She is also moving as a mother who cares for her daughter and can see the pain of Carolyn. Livingston does some fine work as the Perron patriarch, who shows gratitude for the Warrens and loves his family. Taylor is moving as a mother and chilling in the film's final act. The daughters each do a good job with their role.<br/><br/>There were a lot of great technical aesthetics to this film. I enjoyed the camera work by DP John R. Leonetti. I also enjoyed Leonetti's work with natural lights and with regular lights for each shot. The production design (more specifically the house), is very well done and Julie Berghoff's work here with attention to details of making this house be haunted and believable is excellence. Composer Joseph Bishara makes some truly chilling music that makes each scene for effective in terms of scary and jumpy. The editing by Kirk M. Morri is effective and well put together. The makeup artists do a wonderful job. The sound design is also excellent, not just for the music, but the use of natural sound as well as putting other sounds to make the creepiness of what makes things sound scary even more effective."
"swp_1988","9","11","23","18 July 2013"," The Conjuring works with the tried and true and delivers pure, unnerving terror and dread.
","Horror, as a genre, just doesn't cut it in modern cinema. Audiences have become too desensitized to cheap images and loud noises to provoke a 'scare' that everyone has begun to believe that this is the norm. It has been the destruction of a great genre for the past 20 years and we've only had a shimmer of light maybe once a year, if we're lucky, on what truly can be done amongst the vast possibilities of horror. The Conjuring just shook the genre right back into place.<br/><br/>Based on true events, however dramatized, of one of the most shocking events witnessed by controversial paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, The Conjuring lays out the era of the 70's in stylish fashion right from the opening frame and it brings you head first into the atmosphere of the film right away. From there only director James Wan can guide the way...and dare I say it, he has set himself as an auteur of modern horror. He knows not to tamper with a tried and true formula of old-school horror and just goes for the heights of pure, unflinching dread and unbearable tension in nearly every scene, setting up his frames beautifully and timing it all so well, teasing the audience and building the tension as slow as he dares to go within his rich and frightening atmosphere. He delivers a shock or two with sound, but its all set out to test the audiences limits before he truly unleashes a flurry of evil and terror that hasn't been done in such a film for years. I found myself more than once feeling completely unnerved. That is a tough thing to do with me. It was also a nice thing to see that even though the script isn't deep with character development, that the time is still taken to intertwine the family within the evil and show that the power of family is a godly thing.<br/><br/>Great performances across the board are held higher thanks to a truly terrific performance from Vera Farmiga. She has had a fair share of dips in the last couple of years but 2013 is looking to be the year for her.<br/><br/>The Conjuring has to be seen in theaters. Letting the sight of a large screen and the encompassing atmosphere really take you in will have you experiencing all the familiar horror beats, but delivered with such methodical skill and pure terror.

","The first half of the movie has great directing technique, half way through the film it doesn't even have that. A horror piece can't simply rely on really cheap scares like frightening you with loud sounds.<br/><br/>The story is nothing impressive and it's filled with plot holes.<br/><br/>The funniest part of the film is when they cannot perform an exorcism because they need proof to show in order for the catholic church to allow it. The Vatican has ALWAYS relied on the scientific method to demonstrate that what they say is not utterly bullshit.<br/><br/>I think this film becomes comical at some point. A great deal of the audience members were laughing at the ridiculous violence portrayed.<br/><br/>I truly believe that the good reviews are done by critics that the production was able to please by inviting them to premieres, etc. I'm a real horror fan and this is a very dull movie. I believe if they wanted to do a film like this, they should have done something with an extreme level of violence. No one dies in the film! <br/><br/>Lastly I ask you two questions: Why the hell is this set during the 70s? This just adds to the level of cheesiness (if there is such a term) that this movie achieves. And, should there be allowed a disclaimer at the beginning of fiction pieces that says that the story portrayed is based on true events? Sorry to say this guys but there are no demons, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, etc. This kind of claim makes ignorant people believe that this crap is actually out there. Look at the wars in the world, kidnap, executions, etc. We should only be afraid of our fellow men; that, and crappy horror films like this one."
"hemispheres_89","2","9","18","20 July 2013"," This is the beginning of me starting to err on the side of caution with Mr. James Wan
","I don't understand the hype that this movie has been receiving, and I surely don't understand the reviews praising it. Did I see a different movie than everybody else?<br/><br/>This was terrible! I've been a huge James Wan fan ever since the first ""Saw"" movie was released. Then a few years ago, the trailer for ""Insidious"" was released and I was intrigued. I saw it on opening night and I was terrified throughout the entire movie. From the choice of camera angles, to the creepy violin music that rattled your nerves, to the devilishly haunting faces of the entities, it was probably my all-time favourite horror movie up to that point.<br/><br/>The Conjuring has NONE of that.<br/><br/>The first thirty minutes of the movie are the worst, but I had already assured myself that this was acceptable since the movie was probably taking time to warm up the audience and get us settled in. It's just too bad that it seemed to take the full 2 hours to ""settle in"" without ever really knowing what it's trying to accomplish. Any time a potential scare could be possible, it was left unrealized. This brings me to my next major point with this - the scares.<br/><br/>Boy oh boy, if I were to hand an award over to a film who supplied us with an overabundance of the cheapest and shoddiest scares, The Conjuring would take the cake. Doors closing loudly are NOT scary. Similarly, loud and pronounced orchestral music does little else except cause our bodies to jolt involuntarily. It DOES shock and scare people, but not in the way that horror movies are aimed to frighten. This leaves the viewer with a sense of doubt as to whether or not the film was truly scary, or just trying too hard to be scary. This is what I think a lot of these reviewers have fallen prey to; being duped into believing it was truly frightening.<br/><br/>Another point I want to draw on is the ending.....or so it seems. To me, the ending was dragged out for an hour and a half into its inevitable culmination. Demonic possessions, house needs to be cleansed, Ed and Lorraine Warren act as the heroes to defuse the situation. yadda yadda yadda. It's all been done before. That wouldn't be so bad if things were actually scary, but they simply aren't. Towards the last 20 minutes, the viewer must succumb to a ridiculous and appalling (action!!???) scene in which people are getting flung around the room, leading to a juxtaposition of hysterical laughter. What's sad about this is that I think Wan was REALLY aiming for that to be scary.<br/><br/>Now they already have a sequel in the works, before even receiving an attainable statistic on how well this movie will fare. I see that as slight arrogance on Wan's part, but with the predictability of today's audience market, he will succeed."

",". . . if you're a misogynistic Christian ideologue who wouldn't know a good film if it bit you on the bible belt. If you have any doubts, just compare this stinkburger to Poltergeist or The Exorcist, which are brilliantly conceived, well-written, and intelligently-directed films on the same topic, also set in the 70s. Or The Birds, since these doofuses decided to have a bunch fly around and at the house for no particular reason.<br/><br/>Out of a mess of horribly-written lines, I think my favorites were ""A haunting can be like getting gum on your shoe"" and ""She's heading toward the house! She smells like rotten meat!"" Since no one in the film could act, though, the bad script doesn't matter that much. And it's so predictable that you can tell every single time something's about to jump out or appear or drop in.

Now writing this review the rating sits at 7.8, I'm thinking it may end up as a 6-ish rating by 'the end', and I think that would be generous. <br/><br/>The characters were somewhat unnatural, these characters are based on ACTUAL people, correct? Why did it seem as though they were plucked from every other demonic haunted abode genre? Most of the lines (and characters) were clichéd and somewhat 'tacky'. This wouldn't have mattered so much if I felt a greater connection to the characters themselves, but alas the actors did zip for me. Hell, I wouldn't even believe that Ed and Lorraine Warren were real people, if I didn't already know it!<br/><br/>This movie is full of jump scares, and creepy 'what just past behind me' setups, combined with shitty dialogue and so-so acting. All this I can see in the lowest of B grade horror films.<br/><br/>What this movie lacked was high TENSION! The fact that this was 'based on actual events' is not enough 'movie credit' to blow smoke up your moviegoers butts! Give me fear, not creepy sounds.

","I wonder how many horror films the other reviewers here have seen? It really cant be that many. The Conjuring contains not one original idea which hasn't been seen in a thousand movies before it. Banging noises, something in the cellar, clocks stopping, ghostly shadows, an Evil Dead face, someone murdered in a house, I could go on and on. The whole thing just had me watching to point out all the other movies Id seen these things in - made almost as far back as the 1960s.<br/><br/>Really the only appreciation I had for the whole thing was the great look it has of being made a while ago. The set pieces are pretty fantastic I must admit. But honestly, if you've seen even 20 ""horror"" films about a house haunting, you'll see nothing new here. I thought Mr Wans Insidious movie was ridiculous also (I still get a chuckle when I think of that Darth Maul demon appearing towards the end).<br/><br/>I guess with good promotion you can get people to go to the cinema and watch something they may not normally view. I reckon this is what happened here as The Conjuring really isn't that good. But fair play for them accomplishing this as most of the reviews here seem to be very positive. I loved Wans original SAW movie, and I really loved Death Sentence, but this thing is a damp squib for those who enjoy horror and find it a very rare thing to see something new."

I read several comments stating that this movie was horrifying and the best scary movie people had seen in years. I kept waiting...and waiting...and waiting for this to get better, or scary even. Nothing. I literally thought to myself that maybe I was watching the wrong version or something and wasn't seeing what everyone else saw. Far fetched I know, but that's how unbelievably disappointing this was. I was not scared at all and I would not typically consider myself someone that is hard to scare. Granted there are a few moments in this movie where you tense up just a bit, thinking something is going to pop out but that's about it!! This simply did not hold my interest. I just don't get it."

Think of a Curtis Stigers song, you know Captain Cliché, and you have The Conjuring. I defy anyone to tell me one original scene. We had the standard stare in mirror, doors which slammed shut, weird sounds on the tape, levitation, the old wardrobe, cellar only to be visited at night and finally the thunder and lightening. The last bit was when a dozen or so people walked out the cinema.<br/><br/>I am waiting for the Directors cut when, at midnight, the couple whose children are in danger and still stay in the house, go to the cellar open the cupboard in the kitchen and a cat jumps out!

So it was with some anticipation as I sat down in the theater to watch this,since I am a horror movie aficionado, thinking I was in for a treat. Well, instead of a treat, the trick was on me. This movie was not scary in the least, and it was not even a good horror movie. I found myself laughing at some of the scenes, instead of feeling scared or spooked. The only thing I felt was spooky was the weird doll, which was well done and freaky looking. Besides that, this is a bog standard ghost horror movie that many movie watchers have seen a thousand times before. It brings nothing new to the table.

I'm not saying the movie was horrible as it had decent acting but I felt it could do without the heavy handed religious elements but of course it had The Exorcist feel to it but it fell far too short for my taste to The Exorcist in scope. The religious Christian elements basically was a done deal for me.<br/><br/>At one point I also found myself rather bored with the plot and got annoyed how it jumped around so much that it felt disjointed. Maybe if they tried to focus on the plot rather than preaching Christian values and trying to get people to baptize their kids I would have found this movie to be funner to watch."

","Watching ""The Conjuring"" was like going to a Halloween fun house, where all the scares are delivered by people jumping out from dark places. It happened so many times in this film (with accompanying jolts from the soundtrack) that you eventually started anticipating them. Take them out of the movie and the scare factor fades like a ghost.<br/><br/>Look, some of the acting was excellent, especially Lili Taylor (who got a bit more of a workout than she did in ""The Haunting""). <br/><br/>What really ruined this flick for me was the 'based on the true case files of the Warrens."" Hey, I am interested in paranormal investigations and would never discount them out of hand, but when Patrick Wilson, playing Ed Warren, starts to introduce the religious mumbo jumbo it was cringe-worthy. Not only was his acting entirely wooden, but his dialogue seemed to have been written by Pat Robertson. ""True?"" Like ""The Amityville Horror?"" Ask anyone from Long Island how legitimate THAT one was.<br/><br/>Also, hasn't anybody seen ""Scream?"" One should never go into dark, spooky basements alone, or stop in the middle of reciting your exorcism to see what's going to happen next. There are horror movie rules. This one just piled on the clichés. When they added an extraneous scene reminiscent of ""The Birds"" it passed the point of no return.<br/><br/>As of this writing an 8.1? Really?

If you need to paint your ghost's faces with white and circle their eyes with black eyeliner to let us know what they are, I'm just going to frown.

","First let me say, I DO NOT like scary movies as a general rule. When I saw that James Wan was directing (of Saw Fame)I was even less enthused simply because I consider Saw to be torture porn. What got me to watch this movie, despite my misgivings, was the fact that the MPAA gave this movie an R rating. When the producers went back and asked ""Why"", the MPAA simply said it is ""just too scary"" well that piqued my interest. I mean how scary can a movie actually be. Watch this movie and you will find out just how scary a movie can actually be.<br/><br/>James Wan did a masterful job in shaping this movie, there's really nothing new under the sun here, it has the same fair as a lot of other horror movies, but the way it's presented, particularly the last half, will have you putting your hands in front of your face. I swear I walked out of the theater and I was tired from watching this, wrung out, like I had just went 10 rounds with a heavy weight.

","This is a review coming from somebody who is not easily frightened. In an effort not to make a review that's overly long and drawn out (like all the others), I'll just keep my review simple.<br/><br/>First off, the movie does have a solid storyline. A simple one really. A family moves into a house that's haunted, and supernatural hunters are employed to fix it. Nothing really much else happens beyond this premise.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole (for those who have watched it and should take a minute or two to reflect upon the movie after reading this review), isn't really all that scary. That is to say; If you take out all the jump scares put into the movie, there's nothing else to keeping you on your feet and biting your fingernails.<br/><br/>In some ways, if you think about it further, even the jump scares don't fit into the story. Heck, the story might have even been more eerie if the jump scares were replaced with the apparitions slowly coming into view. This would've made a more well-rounded setting as opposed to trying to make a movie half-scary and half-eerie. Horror movies can really either be one or the other, but not both.<br/><br/>In summary, I would say to you that this movie is worth it to watch, but it's not really high priority. The story isn't really original, but the solid acting and nice execution makes for a good watch. My rating is a 7.5 out of 10. I couldn't give it an 8 because there wasn't anything else in the movie to scare you apart from jump scares."
"rsabnis1","7","7","15","4 August 2013"," Creepy & Terrifying...Try Not To Scream !!!!
","Not being a lover of horror films, I never caught up with one in the theatres. The 1973 Academy-Award winner The Exorcist & the Bollywood horror flick Bhoot, directed by RGV was all I had watched from this genre. According to me, both these films had enough visual & sound effects to terrify the audience. As I was going through Bhoot for the second time, I noticed that the main source of terror was the sudden sound effect (irrespective of the screen showing a demonic creature or not) & RGV had used this trick to scare the audiences more than ghostly horrifying visuals.<br/><br/>A very similar but an enhanced effect accompanied by some great visual effects is what The Conjuring (2013) stands on. The Saw director James Wan extracted a piece of story from the case files of Warrens and directed a supernatural thriller proving to rather more than just a mere horror film. It had the soul accompanied by a well-defined structure.<br/><br/>The film opens up in a remarkable scene where a demonologist Ed Warren & his beautiful clairvoyant wife Lorraine who are paranormal investigators providing rational explanations to strange happenings, investigate a case of the Annabelle doll where a small doll suddenly becomes possessed by the ghost of the 7 year old girl haunting the house of two nurses. The scene remarks the introduction of the two researchers who research & provide solution to malignant ghost invasions in a person or in a accommodation. <br/><br/>The film flies back in 1971 where Carolyn & Roger Perron, with their five daughters move into a bungalow in Harrisville, Rhode Island. Right from the day, they settle in the family experiences weird happenings in the house. Their pet dog Sadie is found dead outside the villa, the mother Carolyn gets strange bruises after she wakes up in the morning every day, an unknown entity takes to pulling the daughter's leg every night, the door creaks open mysteriously every now & then. These incidents go on culminating and aggravating as these small strange happenings magnify themselves to reveal large demonic presence in the house. The menacing situation ends up getting so severe and dreadful that out of fear & despair, the couple resort to the Warrens for help.<br/><br/>The story is not just about the family of Perrons. The life of Warrens is also showcased parallel with the life of Perrons. The film is totally one-sided that you can predict that the lives of these two families are going to end up meeting at an unfortunate turn. The film is not recommended for people with a weak heart as the scenes are impressive but frightening. The demonic visuals are sudden, unexpected & fear- inducing personifying the directorial talent of James Wan since he succeeds effectively in generating chills down the spine.<br/><br/>More enhancing are opening & closing credits in the movie, the weapon most under-utilized in modern cinema as the snapshots from real-life Warren Cases are shown. The film's cinematography also receives thumbs up as the cinematographer John Leonetti uses some swooping shots to capture characters as they run inside the house. The film appears to be a winning horror formula after some previously released horror flicks going deep under the ground. Above all, the director's clear fascination to horror films like Amityville horror, the Poltergeist & the Exorcist is clearly visible in the film. As the film progresses to the latter half, comparisons of The Conjuring to The Exorcist becomes totally unavoidable but the director has lived up to the expectations in The Conjuring & succeeded in giving an extra-ordinary film. For weak hearted people, my message to them is ' Try not to scream folks '."

There's a creepy doll, there are some of the best scare techniques from Insidious and your standard haunted house theme.

The film also seems ""thin"" to me in the character development. Ron Livingston (Office Space) seems to have nothing to do with this role except stand around and look confused. He has hardly any lines that are more than 5 or 6 words and he is absent for much of the film.<br/><br/>The children are so interchangeable that it was hard for me to keep track of who was who and who saw what blah blah blah. I think Liv Tyler was a bad choice in casting, she seemed 20 years older than Livingston and although the film takes place in 1971 she is costumed like its 1940, very weird. The Warrens are also played rather thin, although anyone familiar with haunted house stories know who they are. Their performances are good but not outstanding.<br/><br/>There are plenty of creepy moments in the film to be sure, but most are predictable and nothing we have not seen before. I never really felt scared or needed to leave the lights on while watching, this in comparison to the original Amityville Horror 1979, which still scares the crap out of me every time I watch it.<br/><br/>Wait until you cant rent it cheap, it's entertaining but hardly the horror masterpiece some are claiming it is."

","I noticed the surprisingly high IMDb score (which are becoming increasingly useless, but probably another topic for another time) and thought I'd check this flick out, considering it's not often that horror films exceed 7.0 on the IMDb scale. The film starts out promising, with a genuinely creepy vibe and some believable haunting ""events"". For the sake of avoiding spoilers, I won't discuss what happens, but nearly 3/4 through the film, the plot takes a hard left to Crazy Town. Even my wife, a much more forgiving horror fan than I, was asking me out loud if the filmmakers actually expected the audience to believe even a sliver of what was happening on screen. I'm still unsure why horror movies feel the need to go completely over the top in the absence of a decent plot, which this film had initially, but began to quickly unravel during the climax of the story. I still feel Poltergeist is the standard-bearer for ghost/haunting films, and this film doesn't even come close despite some talented actors doing the best they could with the material. This film is simply your typical ghost film, with an inexplicable ending. If you've nothing else to watch, give it a try, but no one should assume this film is any better than dozens of ghost movies released in recent years, and in no way deserves the 7+ IMDb score it currently holds."

This so called authenticity is somehow meant to make the events more shocking, and perhaps it does, it was something Amityville Horror used with great success. However it is no substitute for a good story and that's wear the film falls down.<br/><br/>From the opening scene where the family arrive at their new secluded home were we're given a clue as to how clichéd the movie is going to be:<br/><br/>Husband: ""do you hear that?"" Wife: ""what there's no sound"" (or words to that effect) Husband: ""exactly"" <br/><br/>The dialogue is hokey at best and often cringe-worthy. The storyline is linear and obvious (no clever twists), almost to the point where you think it can't be that obvious but it is.

","The Conjuring is a film I've been interested in seeing for a while and the vast majority of reviews were claiming that it's one of the scariest films of the last 20 years. A story about paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren could be excellent. Well all I can say is don't believe the hype. This is easily one of the most overrated horror films in a long time, and why is that? Because it simply repeats the same formula and scares that have been hammered to death in other recent films of this kind or done much better back in the 70's/80's. The terrifying images and sense dread people were talking about are completely absent and I must have been watching a different film to them. All I saw were creaking floorboards, bad Exorcist make-up and the ultimate annoyance of the jump scare. <br/><br/>The problem with many recent horror films is that they simply can't build up suspense or terror properly and therefore rely on shock value or jump scares, and neither of those things are that scary when you think about them. The 'scares' here are so predictable that I was guessing them with ease. The camera lingers on something in the dark, something goes BANG! very loudly and then it cuts away. It does this over and over again, how on Earth is that scary? The story starts off interestingly enough, if a little slow, whilst never straying too far from the haunted house formula, but the final third descends into chaos and nonsense.The climax itself clearly rips off The Exorcist and Poltergeist. The reveal of reason for the haunting was a massive let down as well. <br/><br/>I can't find many faults in the cinematography as the film looked fantastic for the most part and letting it in 1971 was a very nice touch. The acting was fine too. Patrick Wilson is always solid and Vera Farmiga was good while they made a believable couple. The family were decent and the young girls were all believable too, though Lili Taylor's appearance should have rung alarm bells seeing as she also starred in that horrid remake of The Haunting. The music was okay, but it felt like it was trying to scary you with dissonance rather than add to the mood. <br/><br/>The reviews saying this is scary beyond belief are nonsense and those people seriously need to watch more horror films of yesteryear. Tip to the film-makers, jump scares are not scary whatsoever when they are overused like they are here. The Conjuring is a let-down in every sense of the word."
"hellraiser7","10","3","5","12 February 2014"," Conjuring Evil
","Haunted House stories most of the time play on our fear of what is unfamiliar or unknown, whether it's a new enviorment or just a mere noise that might be more than it sounds. For a while I felt the paranormal/ghost subgenere in horror was starting to run low on steam, but this film proved that there is still plenty of steam left and suppringly turned out to be one of my favorites in the horror subgenere.<br/><br/>This of course is loosely based on one of the cases of real life paranormal investigators Ed and Loraine Warren. Which is cool since I'm into unexplained phenomena show's like ""Unsolved Mysteries"" and ""A Haunting"". Whether you really believe any of it really happened or not I leave up to you.<br/><br/>What I really like about this film is in it's execution; it goes an old school route because most to all of the film uses practical effects. I really like the production value from the house but down to the cars, wardrobe, and anything else to help recreate the early seventies making the film a bit of a period peace. The music score is solid, it really creates an unsettling moodiness, a feeling of dread. Though what gets me is really the moments when it's just absolute quiet, I just know in those moments something will happen.<br/><br/>I really like the effects and the cinematography. Most of the effects are simple ones like doors opening or even certain sound cues, nothing too special but effective all the same, seeing a door swing open or close knowing I'm not the one that did it always creeps me out. You do see the ghosts but not much which I'm fine with, the make up effects are solid their creepy as usual. Cinematography is great, the one that impressed me the most was when it sometimes goes to a point of view shot of either of the characters, which I think is great because it gives you that feeling that your the other character in the film.<br/><br/>There are a lot of memorable moments that generated a lot of jump scares and a certain amount of excitement. One which to me is probably one of the scariest scenes in horror I've ever seen was when the mom was trapped in the cellar and it was just pitch black you couldn't see crap, except for the matches she had which are of little help; I'll admit just the mere thought of this just gives me the creeps. But of course after things a quiet for a moment we hear a voice knowing there's a presence close but not an exact location, until we see some hands from behind her clap. I remember actually jumping along with most of the other audience in that moment, even heard a few screams in the theater; it was a great experience that I don't get often.<br/><br/>But the cast/characters were also really good and actually well rounded. Patrick Wilson (Watchmen) and Vera Farmiga(TV's Bate's Motel) were solid as Ed and Loraine Warren. They had a little charisma and most of all a good back and forth. Even the family was just as good. Ron Livingston (Office Space) as the concerned dad Roger and Lili Taylor (TV's Almost Human) as the afflicted mom Carolyn. Along with the kids whom have moments themselves; couple of them I recognize, Joey King from ""Oz the Great a Powerful"" and Mackenzie Foy from the ""Twilight"" series (for the record have a niece that's a fan of it not me.) What's interesting is the fact you actually care even feel a sense of pathos for them, which is something I don't do enough in the horror genre; but also made me want the good guys all the more to win.<br/><br/>You could also say the film is almost a Christian film since it has not just Christan intervention, but the theme on family. Wanting to be with your family and doing anything for them even protect them.<br/><br/>Overall if your a fan of the paranormal subgenere ""The Conjuring"" is worth conjuring up. What you don't see truly is the most scary.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

","This movie gets my vote as one of the scariest things I've ever seen. James Wan is one of my directing heroes. I feel like the man puts a lot of thought into the scenes. He knows what works, what doesn't work. I can only aspire to be as good, when I enter that line of work in the future.<br/><br/>Couldn't have asked for a better cast, I can't wait if and when he comes back to make a sequel. I love how he pushes the boundaries with the scares. As a dreamer, wanting to be a writing-director, there are things that happens in this movie, that I never would have thought of, but now that I've seen this movie, it gets me thinking.<br/><br/>If you know this movie enough to watch it everyday, then you probably aren't a fan of movies altogether."
"kcoward02","2","3","5","8 January 2014"," What is all the hype about?
","I really don't understand what people find so wonderful about this movie. The first hour is just boring buildup. Then, the climax is a woman screaming for almost ten minutes straight. There are a few parts that have the potential to be scary. These fall flat, though, because they are drawn out and try to hard to frighten the viewer. This film was neither scary nor interesting, with the only unsettling part of it being the creepy doll. I miss the days when horror movies were actually scary and didn't involve the predictable paranormal activity or exorcisms. It's getting old, and The Conjuring is no different. This movie is too much like all of the other demonic movies nowadays. It doesn't find way to stand out amongst others in the genre."
"goods116","6","3","5","21 November 2013"," Basic haunted house story, NOTHING new at all
","I give it a 6 out of 10 as it is a well executed film and fine and watchable, but nothing more. If you have seen lots of horror movies, you will immediately see this is the same old stuff, there is truly NOTHING new here. Family moves into house, slowly notices strange things like the typical doors moving, flashes of a ghost, kids seeing things that adults don't, kids yelling in middle of night and parents run in, go to the local ""ghost hunter,"" ghost hunter comes and senses the evil presence, evil presence escalates attacks/possession, desperate attempts to remove evil presence, conclusion. Sound familiar? Movies like Insidious, The Possession, Mama, and Sinister are basically the EXACT same movie more or less. People who rate this a 7.6 have simply not seen enough movies to realize how hackneyed and dull this plot is."
"witster18","6","3","5","20 November 2013"," solid, but not as outstanding as some of the first page reviews
","I'll start by saying that I enjoyed this film, but the film suffers from a few things.<br/><br/>The first. ""The Conjuring"" fails to conjure-up ANY new ideas. We've seen all this before, and stylistically the film doesn't offer anything to separate it from those other, similar films. I'd give the film a 7 on the scare-meter, but I thought the look was a bit too 'dry-70's-drab'.<br/><br/>The second. The film fails miserably in the music department. We get one or two 70's songs thrown-in-the-mix, but where is the traditional score, and the creepy music? <br/><br/>The film just lacked that extra-ooomf. It's really hard to explain, but I'll try.<br/><br/>THe film needs a more serious threat. There's not ENOUGH carnage here. I don't need a slaughterhouse, but bumps and bruises are about as serious as this threat gets. They had the opportunity to take it over the top and off a couple of meaningless characters, but they failed to do it. I understand that they're keeping true to a so-called true story, but who cares about the historical accuracy of any of this? Honestly?<br/><br/>So what did I like? What effects are here - are done well. The overall production values are high, the acting is solid because the cast is solid and the writing is fine.<br/><br/>There is a parallel narrative to this story which goes unexplained and really serves only one purpose - to plant a seed for a possible sequel.<br/><br/>Call me crazy, but I enjoyed Aja's ""Maniac"" as much as I liked this(just to throw-out the last horror film I watched). ""Maniac"" had no scares, but at least it had a little style. ""Halloween"" and ""House of the Devil"" put a little flair into the seventies - this didn't.<br/><br/>It's funny how we sometimes put films like this on a pedestal, perhaps because the genre has been struggling to regain form, but I found this to be no better than other lower-rated films like ""The Haunting in Connecticut"", and not much better than some very average entries into the genre like ""The Last Exorcism"" or ""Dark Skies"". It's amazing, having just said that, how much this movie uses from those last three films.<br/><br/>Yet Another comparison would be ""Sinister"" which is currently rated .7 lower than this, but I found that movie definitely HAD that something extra. The style, the creepiness, the music,... those IMDb-scores should be flip-flopped imo, but this is a newer release. I suspect the scores will get a little closer as time goes by.<br/><br/>There were also a couple of things about ""The Conjuring"" that I thought were a little inconsistent. Two that stand out came towards the end of the film(WARNING SUPER SMALL MEANINGLESS SPOILER ALERT). The first was when days after showing the family sleeping in one room, and after they had been through enough to never separate again, the film goes right back to showing one of the girls sleeping alone in a bedroom. By that point of the film it would have never happened... ever.. another moment of awkwardness for me came when Lily's character(the mom) steps out of the house and into the light and all of her injuries/bruising etc disappears.. I understand the thought, but the thought stinks. It would have added more credence to everything if those bruises remained. Those weren't the only little problems like this, but I've made my point.<br/><br/>I don't mean to discourage anyone from seeing this because IT IS above average, and better than most of the crap in terms of new release horror.. just don't go into it with high expectations... might have been part of the problem for me. <br/><br/>See Sinister first if you haven't. And if you watch this and like it - try out ALL the films I've mentioned previously. <br/><br/>63/100"
"idontknowiknowthatidontknow","1","17","49","19 July 2013"," I dream plot lines better than this
","I knew from the IMDb high rating that it was either going to be really good or really bad...It turned out to be really bad. I work in the film projection booth so I know what I'm talking about. OK, so as of this writing the IMDb rating is a 7.9 for this movie. Now, around the mid 2000's, IMDb rating developed a sociological phenomenon of a nature in which really really average movies gets really high ratings like 7.5 and above. This phenomenon did not happen before that. I believe the reason is due to the fact that IMDb is getting more popular, so what was originally mainly movie buffs and generally more ""experienced"" movie watchers' ratings are getting diluted by newer and less experienced movie watchers. Mediocre movies such as the fighter, true grit, all Tarantino and eastwood films. It seems as if a movie is logical and elicits a reaffirming positive message and has good cinematography, then it's going to be rated highly. Now James Wan is a director that showed some flashes of brilliance directing Insidious and Death Sentence. Being that the rating is 7.9, I thought this had a chance to be really good. If this was 2002, I know a 7.9 would no doubt be good. But in the year 2013, IMDb's rating has mutated. Basically I knew about 40 minutes into the movie that it was another deceptive IMDb mutation rating, aka: ""really bad"" movie. The movie is basically 1+1=2 2+1=3 and 3+1=4. In another words very logical, there are no twists or turns. There are no hills or valleys. And forget about any cliffs or mountains. Just a lazy drive on a rainy night with a few bums scaring you at the red light by popping out asking for change. It does have one nice soundtrack in the beginning. This is why society and humans in general are easily manipulated by the rich elite, we need to wake up. The good movie makers rarely get a chance these days. My observational acumen is very high and my imagination is off the charts."
"utahman1971","1","17","50","19 July 2013"," Really People? No True Horror Fan on these good reviews.
","I got to say this. What is wrong with you all? Saying this movie is one of the best. Holy **** it was bad and slow. It had no scares at all, no gore, no swearing, no nudity. It was like watching a television movie as TV-14 rating on big screen. With the loud noises that were supposed to be scary was not scary at all, that I could of slept with it going on. It was nothing compared to the exorcist. It was terrible. What did all the underage kids sneak into the theater to see this and gave it great reviews? I swear you guys are nuts to say this was that good. James Wan other movies were better than this. I am starting to think all of these reviews are fake.<br/><br/>This should of been a thriller genre. There are thrillers that are scarier than this movie. This was like most terrible movie that could be in the horror genre. Boggles my mind that people think this is scary, just as bad as people thought the Blair witch project was rated good for swearing and running around the woods through the whole movie. We got a nutty world who thinks these movie are great or just teenagers sneaking into rated so called R movies. Surprised I am the only true horror fan that did not like this. The is basically paranormal activity 5 and probably copy of it or is it.<br/><br/>Don't like putting people down, but you guys need to check on your brains. Something in there is telling you something wrong. Will not recommend this to anyone. Dead Silence was better, and that was lame too. Insidious was about barely better than this one, but a sliver chance. Thought the world was going bad, but a 7+ rating on this movie on this site just says how bad this site is for reviews. Heck, half or more reviews per movie is not even selected a vote for it, so that movie basically does not get the ratings they deserve or don't deserve.<br/><br/>This site is so bad that you can't trust anyone that says how they feel about a movie, because of all these reviews for this movie on this site. I think zombies ate their brains for dinner, and they came to see this awe full piece of trash. This is not hype for this movie, it is just dumb people that know nothing of what is good, except they probably watch TV movies all the time and compare this one to them. <br/><br/>Oh well, guess the horror movies are going to just keep getting worse and not better, and its because of these terrible reviews of saying it is the best. I am so glad I went to see You're Next. It was heck of a lot better than this movie could ever be. Heck, The Blair Witch Project had things that were more chance of being rated R, than this movie. It was in the terrible list of horror movies too.<br/><br/>These reviews have to be teenagers sneaking in the theater to see this. No in hell way is this that good. Even the dumbest person would know this sucks that bad. Yes, I am calling you all stupid with the good reviews. Screaming teenagers that scream during a non screaming part in the movie in the theater. Lame as heck, and annoying to those trying to see if there is something worth getting out of these terrible movies.<br/><br/>I do not support James Wan in any of his movies anymore or go see them at the theater anymore, and I really hope others will follow me in this decision too.<br/><br/>Wow, there is still good reviews of this movie. What is even scary in this movie? I have not read one good review, that actually saying what is scary in it. It is not. Scary is no vocabulary in this movie. It is the biggest borefest or snorefest or sleepfest.<br/><br/>Now that I got to throw up reading these reviews saying its a great movie. Nothing believable from any of the reviews on this site anymore. People just don't from good or bad any more. This site may have a lot of visitors, but it is badly taken care of with so many bad reviews, and I don't mean bad as bad for the most part. I mean good reviews for bad movies, and bad reviews for good movies. <br/><br/>I know people have their own opinion of what is good and bad, but come on. What is all the reviews for this movie from? 6 year olds? The reviews that are rated good for this movie is going to bring out another bad movie from James Wan. This shows he is good at bringing out bad movies, which should not even be happening.<br/><br/>At least Saw was interesting and horror. The rest of his were down right the worst of his directing career. Any one that thinks taking out gore, nudity, and swearing, makes a great movie, then stay a child and be childish all the time, because that is what this movies are made for.<br/><br/>This movie right here on this site is going to ruin the whole concept of movies altogether for everyone. We will keep seeing PG-13 so called horror movies that aren't horror, and we will see more rated R movies, that should never be rated R, because MPAA keeps doing that stupid its scary, when it isn't ratings for movies.<br/><br/>The MPAA needs to go back to school and relearn what ratings is. This world is going to crumble down, and IMDb will start it off with this movie on this site."
"dkunce08","1","9","23","27 July 2013"," Character build-up or pure waste of time?
","Some critics hail this as the scariest movie ever, well, it isn't. For fans of horror films, you risk being very disappointed. The film takes about 60 minutes before things actually begin to happen. I understand the importance of character build-up, however, one whole hour is way too long for this type of movie. The only element of this movie that might be considered 'scary' is: the sound. Doors slamming, sound effects, etc, are basically what makes this film 'scary'. In all honesty, I can think of 100 scarier movies, example: Child's Play (seriously!!!). If you absolutely must see this film, do not waste your time seeing it in a theater. Instead, wait until it comes out on DVD or PPV."
"chrid-914-212111","2","4","8","1 March 2015"," From a Little Scare to a Big Laugh
","Having read some reviews previous to seeing this movie I was led to expect a really good old-fashioned scary time. And it WAS a bit scary at times in the first half but as the film progressed it became more and more silly, so that in the second half it became more of a 'make funny comments and have a laugh' experience.<br/><br/>One of the funniest moments is when the husband guy is looking through a hole in the wall and he's supposed to be really frightened but he just looks a bit worried, and with his pudding basin haircut and dumb expression he so reminded me of Lou Costello in that monster spoof movie that I burst out laughing. Actually Costello was better at pretending to be frightened than this guy, Livingstone, or whatever his name is.<br/><br/>Also funny is the bit where in the middle of intense action the husband shouts: ""We have to get her to the priest, for the exorcism!"" as if the audience had forgotten by that point and needed to be reminded. That made us laugh a lot!<br/><br/>Funniest of all is how you're supposed to buy all the cod religion/psychology stuff spouted by Warren, the so-called ghost expert. And that the premise is that ""only a real Catholic priest"" has the ability to drive a demon out of a person! So when the guy's wife is possessed and being super-nasty Warren says ""I'll have to do it myself."" And the husband guy, who is NOT religious, says: ""but you're not a proper priest!"" And then this Warren guy takes a bible and starts reading some stuff. And it's in Latin! Like, it HAS to be Latin or it won't work! But he's crap at reading Latin. Oh man! I was expecting the demon to say, like: ""Give me a break! I'm not getting out of this person for that crappy Latin!""<br/><br/>This film was not scary and you can not take it seriously, especially the finale, which is really over the top and ludicrous. Near the end the possessed woman is tied to a chair with a blanket over her head (because she bit someone) and then, in an attempt by the director to make it exciting, the chair rises from the floor and turns upside down and wiggles about. This also made us laugh a lot. And then the chair falls down but instead of the woman falling on her head, it does a neat little flip at the last moment and she lands on her back! This is because the happy ending requires her to stay intact so she can be dispossessed (?) unpossessed (?) depossessed (?) and return to being a good old swell American mom.<br/><br/>Another daft thing is how the ghost-hunter guy, even though his wife is messed-up from helping people get rid of demons, and even though they have a young daughter, still he insists on keeping a room filled with demon-infested objects. And a guy comes to visit and says, very intelligently: ""why don't you take all this stuff to the incinerator?"" and this Warren guy comes up with some total bullshit about ""burning it doesn't get rid of the demons"". So instead he keeps all of it like a junk shop from hell in his own house!!<br/><br/>I can't be bothered to write more about this film now. Thanks for reading!"

This film focuses on their dealing of a case in 1971 in which a family is terrorized by evil forces in their Rhode Island farmhouse. What can I say? The teaser trailer for this film hooked me. It was nerve-wracking and different. Unfortunately, the rest of the film didn't entirely pan out that way— but before you get ahead of yourself, no, it's not that bad of a film. It's actually really well-made.<br/><br/>While the legitimacy of Ed and Lorraine Warren and the purported hauntings they investigated are questionable to say the least, I'm going to leave the reality of everything aside and just focus on the film as it's presented. It is billed as being ""Based on a true story"", which is apparently true of just about every horror movie released today, but it is at least partially true; there really was a family who claimed to have experienced events along the lines of this, and Ed and Lorraine Warren really did investigate it; I can only assume the writers took some hefty liberties provided the dramatic last act of the film.<br/><br/>The direction is great and moody. James Wan, who rose to fame almost immediately with ""Saw"", toys with old school supernatural horror conventions and levels moodiness with jump scares, keeping an even level of both which generates a great deal of tension. The cinematography is in accordance with the film's dreary atmosphere, but maintains the glossy finish of a high-budget production rather than going for grain. The set design here is also very nice, and, as a period piece, the film has an authentic '70s feel to it.<br/><br/>Another particularly strong point of the production is its actors— the four adult leads are respected performers with ranges that go beyond what's typically necessary in the horror genre, and thus, if anything, their presences in the film elevate what could have potentially been supernatural horror fodder had it been in the wrong hands. Wilson and Farmiga are perfect choices for Ed & Lorraine Warren, and Taylor and Livingston give incredibly natural performances (aside from Taylor's very unnatural possession scene at the end of the film, but that's on the writers' hands).<br/><br/>What then, do say, is the ho-hum about? I mean, look— a witch having cursed your land, her ghost and all of her victims' ghosts haunting the house, possessions, flying crucifixes, levitation, Satanism, nooses, children with imaginary friends who are actually ghosts— you see what I'm getting at here? The truth is that all that makes up the plot of ""The Conjuring"" is so terribly contrived that it makes the film edge upon boring. Perhaps it's not necessarily the fault of the filmmakers if they were simply adapting the testimony of the people who claim to have experienced these things, but the film jam packs about every supernatural horror trope that you could possibly think of into its narrative, and, as a result of that, becomes a bit of a retread. It plays with all the things we've seen before time and again, and for that reason I found the film a bit of a letdown, at least narratively; there have been a multitude of films based upon cases that the Warrens investigated, namely ""The Amityville Horror"" and ""The Haunting in Connecticut"", and both of these films bear striking similarities in content to ""The Conjuring"". I would be more forgiving of this if the film had clearly set out to be some sort of throwback to '70s horror, but the high production values and overall mis-en- scene do not suggest this, so it at times lost my complete attention.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I'm very divided on ""The Conjuring"". There are some splendidly tense scenes, the acting is fantastic, and the film is by all means very well-made, but its contents make it come off as a conglomeration of conventionality. If you go in with this in mind, ""The Conjuring"" might potentially be more enjoyable, but for someone who expected something a bit ""outside the box"", I didn't get that at all; although ""The Conjuring"" is very well-made and at times quite creepy, it is by-the-books in about every way possible, yet has the attitude that it isn't at all. 5/10."
"nesfilmreviews","8","4","8","18 July 2013"," Thoroughly enjoyable with a sequel on the way, and quite possibly a franchise.
","""The Conjuring"" is an enjoyable, spine-chilling paranormal saga directed by James Wan (""Saw"", ""Insidious""), and it has already been given the green light by New Line Cinema for a sequel before the first installment has even hit theaters on July 19. A welcome throwback to classic 1970s chillers, with spectacular production design work, a well-constructed script, impressive atmospheric set pieces, and rounded out with terrific performances from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga. The film primarily utilizes the old bag of tricks for scares very effectively, creating a terrifying atmosphere of bloodless scaremongering.<br/><br/>Set in the 1970s, ""The Conjuring"" tells the story of husband-and-wife demonologists Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson), and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga), who are best known for their case involving the Amityville Horror, and are now investigating the secluded Harrisville, Rhode Island home of Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston.) The family has recently moved into the house with their five daughters (Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy and Kyla Deaver), and have begun experiencing a series of unexplained occurrences. Lorraine immediately detects that something isn't right in the house, and the pair conclude that the Perron's home is possessed by multiple demons, with their initial investigation revealing that the trouble may have begun as far back as the Salem Witch trials. Meanwhile, the Warren's presence enrages whatever is within the house, and the supernatural activity escalates to terrifying levels.<br/><br/>James Wan and his group of frequent collaborators are clearly well in sync for ""The Conjuring."" The film nods its head to everything from ""The Exorcist"" (1973) to ""The Amityville Horror"" (1979), while developing an atmosphere of trepidation, with well- timed scares that will keep viewers on the edge. All the ingredients of a standard paranormal story are present: a haunted and secluded house, a peaceful family being terrorized, strange noises in the night - and its all-familiar territory. However, the film is so finely tuned, it comes across as a respectable homage to the genre. It's reassuring to see a genre film that contains a compelling story and has interesting characters, rather than serving up a number of teenagers ready to be tortured. <br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" is primarily intended as a haunted-house attraction, a ride through a hall of nerve-racking horrors. Wan's direction is perfectly paced, pulling off some properly scary set pieces (a game of 'hide and clap'; some business involving a mirror and a music box), and slowly ratcheting up the tension. The frightening escalation of events gives a permanent tension in a feature film that is certainly predictable, but smoothly conducted to satisfaction."

","The movie starts out with the basic horror movie set up Family moves to new house in middle of nowhere, An elder daughter who complains, Dog that doesn't want to enter house. This was such basic horror movie plot. This ""great scary movie"" had nothing to it, it didn't make me scared, didn't jump, the whole theater was laughing at the movie, not once did i hear any scream or anything. The movie has great acting, the plot was basic, that sounds and music was unneeded or unrequired in 3/4 of the film. The film ended stupidly that events that happened weren't even bad, why the people decided to never mention it I don't even know the problem was solved with no major problem. Then the movie has such stupid things, the investigator fell down, at least two stories maybe three and didn't even break a bone or injure herself. Then all the paintings fell down in that hallway and no body heard it. This movie had so many problems , wasn't scary and had a basic Horror Movie Plot. To conclude i would not suggest this movie."

The story ( anyone could draw up ) I sat through the whole thing and I think people need to stop going to see the same movie over and over. I really wanted to like it thats why I stayed for the whole thing. I would have rather left half way through and read a spoiler to see what happened. I would say the acting was OK. Vera was excellent. If you are on the fence about going to see this, wait for DVD. There is nothing groundbreaking here."

I highly doubt this!!!I do not believe that these people were really haunted at all. For me it was not that scary at all. Acting was so so! In no way can compare to the ONE TIME SCARIEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME...The Exorcist. So if you want to spend 10-20 bucks for the hell of it...go for it! Otherwise I would just wait.

","You're reading this because you're a horror movie fan and are dreaming of a good horror movie to come along that will truly give you a scare. I personally didn't believe it was possible anymore with the market saturation of crappy horror films, and every possible twist and scare tactic already used. <br/><br/>But with that said, this is one heck of a good movie. There are a few jump scenes, a few hair raising scenes and a few spine tingling scenes, all nicely mixed together with great acting from everyone in the movie. It's so hard to find a horror movie with great acting, and this one truly delivers.<br/><br/>Scariest movie ever? No. Every horror movie uses that line in their advertising. But this one is worth the trip for those that love a good horror movie. It holds none of the typical intestinal spilling, gore driven, or machine hacking sick things Hollywood usually dreams up for most of their horror movies. I personally detest those type of movies as they are just disgusting junk for brainless twits with a fourth grade mentality.<br/><br/>The Conjuring thrives with solid, great acting, a good haunting/possession storyline, and most definitely some tense, and sometimes scary scenes. I have read the negative reviews of this movie, and I can only say that each one of them sounds like wanna be critics trying to ""act"" as if they know what they are talking about, or people that just love gore and didn't get their addiction fed.<br/><br/>Everyone I know personally that has seen this movie has loved it, and I'm glad they recommended it to me. I recommend it to all of you as well. In the end, if you don't like it, you've only lost $10...that's 3 beers at the bar. You'll be OK."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","5","11","19 July 2013"," ""The Conjuring"" offers more of the same, but Wan makes the most of it
","James Wan must feel like he's got something to prove. The filmmaker has had success more than once (""Saw"" and ""Insidious"") in a horror genre that has been obnoxiously stagnant in recent years (everything is either a haunted house or exorcism film). ""The Conjuring"" is both, so more of the same for Wan.<br/><br/>There's almost nothing original about ""The Conjuring."" We're talking spot-the-cliché drinking game unoriginal. So it begs the question: did Wan want to prove he could make a great horror film from overused genre hallmarks, or does he just have no interest in innovative filmmaking? Probably a little of both.<br/><br/>The one unique angle of ""The Conjuring"" comes in the form of two non-fictional protagonists. Ed and Lorraine Warren are two paranormal investigators/demonologists who claim to have investigated upwards of 10,000 hauntings from the '50s to the '80s. They are most known for investigating the famous ""Amityville horror"" case that inspired two film versions (and frankly, ""The Conjuring"" is almost like a third).<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as the Warrens, who are brought in to investigate disturbances in the new Rhode Island country home of the Perron family. Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston)and their five girls have experienced a number of phenomena (moving doors, rotting flesh smell, a little ghost boy who's befriended the youngest daughter, etc.), and the Warrens can tell immediately when they enter that something particularly bad is here.<br/><br/>Like any effective horror film, the build-up is painfully slow so that your mind moves into darker places than the film is going for the first half hour or so. All the occurrences happen predominantly at 3:07 in the morning, so the film cycles between day and night scenes in a way that'll drive you mad in the way that it teases a reprieve but that goes straight back into someone following a suspicious noise behind a door or under the bed.<br/><br/>The scares of the film escalate too, from suspense techniques meant to elicit anxious anticipation of bigger scares to all-out fantastical mayhem, including a gruesome exorcism. It does so with a good measure of tact, but ""The Conjuring"" could have played the mystery angle longer than it does in order to earn some more points.<br/><br/>One of the absolute standouts is Farmiga's performance as Lorraine, who is among the best characters I can ever recall in a genre horror film. A clairvoyant, she easily sees demon spirits and can sense what's going on. Farmiga gives Lorraine so much grace and courage that we clearly sense she is a woman who has seen a lot. At the same time, she gets frightened when we expect her to as well. She has some a subplot involving a traumatic past experience and her relationship to her daughter, but the film leaves us hanging by not finishing those arcs, presumably in a cocky ""save it for the sequel"" way.<br/><br/>A scenario in which some people are completely unimpressed by ""The Conjouring"" while others consider it great seems a likely outcome. The market is stale for new horror ideas, while studios making horror films understand that familiarity gets people into the theater. So those looking for something novel won't find it, but those who want the tropes of the genre will be more than pleased.<br/><br/>Wan in particular knows all the tropes, and better than anyone, he milks them for all of their worth. He does so with incredible technical prowess, but more importantly, the ability to understand the audience's instincts -- what they're thinking and expecting.<br/><br/>For fans who know exactly what Wan offers them, consider ""The Conjuring"" on par with ""Insidious,"" only a little more cliché and with a more intriguing mystery.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading!

"slezak84","9","2","3","29 July 2016"," Horror revamped
","""The Conjuring"", does everything right the entire film. From classic scares, to impressive acting, there are few flaws throughout. We can agree this movie borrowed some ideas from horror classics like ""The Exorcist"", ""The Amityville Horror"", and others, but the way this new film is executed is what makes this film so frightening. We get a taste of all these films, but in correct portions, meaning nothing is overdone. Giving background on these paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren gives the audience some information on what these guys are all about. Unlike most of these ""Ghost Hunters"" nowadays, the Warrens attempt to find any logical explanation for cases instead of jumping to the conclusion the victims are being terrorized by a paranormal force. The movie is based on the true events of the Perrons in 1970, which makes what was already a creepy movie into a nightmare. Little by little, we uncover the mystery of the Perron house and it's past. The superb acting makes the scares believable and life like, adding another element to the overall scariness of the film. We learn early in the movie the Warrens are experienced investigators, knowing how to handle almost any case and seem to be rattle by nothing. But we see true fear in the eyes of Ed and Lorraine as they uncover a case nothing like they've ever experienced. ""The Conjuring"" is a unique film on its own, making its presence felt in the horror industry."
"Leviathan80","9","2","3","28 November 2015"," Pleasantly surprised
","The Conjuring, a 2013 horror film directed by James Wan was based on the true events recorded by Ed and Lorraine Warren in the 1970's. The story sees a family experience supernatural occurrences shortly after they move into a new farmhouse. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson put forth a fantastic performance playing the Warrens alongside Lilli Taylor and Ron Livingston who played Carolyn and Rodger Perron.<br/><br/>Usually I have no real interest in watching films that are based on 'true events' as most seem to be overly dramatic and obviously fake. However, The Conjuring is by far my favorite horror film of 2013, the storyline was far-fetched (a witched who cursed the land possess the mother to kill the child) but at the same time was made to be very believable, I think this is partly because of all the marketing that the film put forth before release, these included 3 trailers and a featurette, which included the real family that the case studies where based on and an interview with Lorraine Warren. Most films that happen to be based on true events always turn out to be a hoax, Paranormal Activity for example claimed to be based on actual experiences when it was first brought out but then carried on to make numerous films and killed the original buzz of it being 'real'. Although, The Conjuring sequel that is being talked about may actually, like Paranormal Activity, ruin the 'buzz' if the storyline carried out to much.<br/><br/>There was a big focus on the Annabelle doll that featured in a few of the trailers and the opening scene of the movie. I must criticize the movie on this note because I think that this was really irrelevant, I know that there is talk for a spin off film based around the Annabelle doll but again I think this how no real relevance to the film itself. All in all I think the film is definitely worth a watch if you're a thrill seeker and love a good horror film! Thumbs up to James Wan on this film!"

"ethansunkes","8","2","3","7 November 2014"," The Conjuring
","The Conjuring stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators that are working to help a family being terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse. Since this movie came out in July of 2013 I have seen it 4 times, and each time it gets better and better. The Conjuring is the best horror movie to come out in years, and when you think about its not too different from anything that has come out recently. The concept is no different from two other decent horror movies in recent years, Insidious and Paranormal Activity, which both have a family's house being haunted by ghosts. But this one is so different and so much better. James Wan, the Director, who also directed Insidious, is the best horror director working today. That is because he understands the genre so well and knows how to make an actually scary movie, without the stupid jump scares. And yes, he does do it on occasion but only when it is actually earned and is not just a harmless character standing behind a door, but when it is actually something really scary. The Horror genre has changed so much through the years going from Monster movies to Slasher movies in the 80's and 90's and now the Paranormal movies. And in my opinion the whole genre is kind of fading away and there is really only 1 or 2 good ones every couple of years. And it is safe to say The Conjuring is it and definitely deserves a viewing from anyone who is a fan of horror. 10/10."

","So here I go, let's get our first ever October Horrorfest underway, some of you may know I am a HUGE Horror aficionado I have been hooked on the genre since I was in single digit age. Anyway onto the review.<br/><br/>Set in the early 1970s, The Conjuring focuses on the work of renowned paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren who are now lecturing throughout the United States in colleges about the cases they come across.<br/><br/>Just as they plan to hang up their proverbial boots and call it a day, income the Perron family Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn (Lili Taylor) who are completely petrified for their lives and the lives of their 5 children (all daughters if memory serves). There is something incredibly evil living within their new home, which doesn't take long for the Warrens long to discover that the evil is there to stay but what is it? Who would have guessed that James Wan the mind behind the ultimate gore porn Horror in a very long time would turn out to be one of the best Horror directors working right now? I surely did not, don't get me wrong I am not casting a shadow on the Saw franchise I enjoy the films just they are not Horror they are their own genre. I mean he done pretty good with ""Dead Silence"" in 2007 but mostly gore porn which in itself he done brilliantly.<br/><br/>The film was a thoroughly enjoyable thrill ride full of scares, jumps and well written, if you are the Horror fan who cares about scares then watch this now! Even the ""hide and clap"" scene made famous in the trailers doesn't lose its charm in the film first or even second time around. I personally am a huge fan of the Warrens work which has been made into several films over the years.<br/><br/>Overall, a film packed with scares, impressive acting and pretty good special effects which itself is a saving grace for an recently dying genre. One of the must see Horror films in recent years!"

"TheMovieRealm","9","2","3","31 August 2014"," A Genuinely Scary Throwback to Old-School Horror
","It's been quite some time since I've seen a film as seriously creepy and spine-tingling as the paranormal horror film, THE CONJURING (2013), from director James Wan (Saw, Insidious). It's a film that taps into your darkest fears of the supernatural, not with grotesque gore (which I don't mind in certain films), but with a slow build up of spooky, foreboding atmosphere and psychological dread achieved through extended silences, eerily long camera moves and expertly timed reveals. This is not only one of the best supernatural/haunted house films I've ever seen, but one of the best horror films of the last two decades.<br/><br/>The film stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Ed and Lorraine Warren, a real-life married couple and paranormal investigation team who were also involved in the case of the haunting of the DeFeo residence in Amityville, NY which became known as The Amityville Horror. The couple has amassed a collection of thousands of case files throughout their years of investigating the supernatural. Lorraine is a clairvoyant who experiences visions of past events and present demons upon entering a haunted residence. She has a gift (though some may call it a curse) that allows her to see things that other people probably wouldn't want to see. Ed Warren does not possess the same clairvoyant gift as his wife, but he is just as knowledgeable about everything paranormal. Ed has the distinction of being the only person not ordained by the Catholic Church who is authorized to perform exorcisms.<br/><br/>The time period is the 1970s. After giving a lecture at a local college, Ed and Lorraine are approached by a concerned woman (Lili Taylor) who claims that after moving with her family into a new home, they have begun to experience bizarre and frightening occurrences. The woman, whose name is Carolyn Perron, asks Ed and Lorraine if they will come and have a look inside the house, and needless to say, what they find is not pretty. Ed and Lorraine soon take on the case and attempt to help the Perron family (the mother, the father played by Ron Livingston, and their five daughters) rid their house of the malevolent entities that have inhabited it.<br/><br/>The primary highlights here are the stellar direction and expertly crafted scares orchestrated by the talented young filmmaker and horror maestro James Wan. The atmosphere is effectively eerie and foreboding at all times. Wan makes good use of uncomfortably long silences and lingering camera shots, creating suspense through fearful anticipation. On the surface it may seem that the usual haunted house movie tropes are thrown in, but ultimately it's not about what devices are used, but the fresh and innovative ways in which Wan uses them. The slow-burn pace of the first half causes you to become deeply connected with the characters, and by the time you arrive at the intense second half, you are fully invested in every twist and turn.<br/><br/>The biggest standout performance in the film comes from Vera Farmiga as Lorraine Warren, the kind, soft-spoken wife and mother who happens to be frightfully tuned in to the supernatural world. The screenplay and Farmiga's performance do an excellent job of conveying Lorraine's overwhelming desire to help others despite the toll it takes on her both physically and psychologically. As Ed says in the movie, ""Every case takes a little piece of her."" Lorraine is an incredibly brave, strong, and intelligent woman who is also quite compassionate, especially to anyone with problems of the paranormal variety. Patrick Wilson's performance as Ed Warren is also quite good. Ed primarily follows Lorraine's lead when it comes to her visions and the things she picks up from entering a house, but he is very confident and knowledgeable in his own right. Ed is very supportive of Lorraine and looks out for her well-being first and foremost. He obviously wants to continue the work he does with Lorraine but is also concerned about the potentially negative effects it can have on her. They discuss this issue several times throughout the film. The pair makes an excellent team and they balance each other out quite nicely. Lili Taylor does a very good job as the loving and concerned mother of the haunted family, and Ron Livingston is excellent as usual as the laid-back, but also caring and concerned, father. I'm unfamiliar with the five young actresses who play the daughters, but each one of them delivers an extremely genuine and sympathetic performance while managing to bring unique traits to their characters. Through rich, detailed characterizations, we come to care deeply for everyone in the film.<br/><br/>The sound design in the film brings the overall feeling of dread up several levels. A creaking door, a whispering voice, an eerie song from a child's toy, a loud CRASH, all expertly crafted to keep you on the edge of your seat, ready to jump a mile at any given moment. Every song on the soundtrack oozes 1970s vibes and manages to capture the mood and feel from that time period flawlessly.<br/><br/>THE CONJURING is a rare horror film in this day and age. One with little to no blood or gore, where the main characters aren't teenagers. This film is all about a fear of the dark, a fear of the unknown. It causes you to confront your darkest supernatural nightmares by leaving a certain amount to the imagination, which is almost certainly worse than anything that could ever be shown. This film is a loving homage/throwback to horror films of old, and takes the foundation those films have set and creatively builds upon it. THE CONJURING is one of the best and flat-out most unsettling and frightening horror movies I've ever seen. My recommendation: watch it in the middle of the night in the pitch dark for maximum effect.<br/><br/>http://www.themovierealm.blogspot.com"

","Real rating: 8/10<br/><br/>Disclaimer: If a film's IMDb rating is too low, I will always give it 10/10 and then give my real rating in the review.<br/><br/>I think the producers and director got totally sick of all this Paranormal Activity rubbish and said ""You wan't a scary movie? We'll give you a scary movie!!"" Everything happens in the order you think it's going to, and you know when you're going to get scared, and you don't care.<br/><br/>It is a pleasurable ghost-train ride and you can see everything coming towards you and you can't stop it and THAT ROCKS. Intstead of tinfoil-hat nutters and cheap cash-ins with unwatchable video footage and fishing-line stunts, we get an in-your-face haunted house story.<br/><br/>And it has the 'Based on truth' (ho ho) thing, too, but at least it carries this on it's sleeve instead of just assuming the audience will buy it."
"collinddean","8","2","3","15 February 2014"," Take my Challenge
","With my wife out of town I decided to take the opportunity to watch a horror flick. Being easily scared, my wife stays away from horror movies at all cost, and therefor I rarely get the chance to watch a scary movie. Not to mention the genre has produced some pretty lame titles as of late. I have been wanting to watch The Conjuring for quite some time now and decided that I would watch it this weekend in my empty house. I don't ever get scared by horror movies, but this one was different. The scares keep coming from the very beginning. The thing that separates a really scary movie from the rest, is it's ability to keep you scared long after you are done watching it. James Wan is the master of this. This movie will stick with me for a while... and I almost regret watching it for that reason... almost. <br/><br/>If you are the type of person who enjoys a good scare. Find a night when your in your house alone. Turn off all the lights and watch this movie. My money says that your light won't stay off through the first 20 minutes."
"TiagoRicardo","9","2","3","3 February 2014"," ""The Conjuring"" reaches a new level of intensity and creepiness that possessed me
","James Wan you almost got me with Insidious, and with that I mean you almost gave me the most scary hour and half of my life inside a movie theater. I was scared as s***t but I could handle it. But then, three years later, you were able to bring to the world the most brilliant horror movie of the decade and perhaps one of the best horror movies ever made. I am of course talking about ""The Conjuring"". This amazing film based in the stories of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Flaming) who were American paranormal investigators (associated frequently with ""The Amityville Horror""), got my nerves right in the beginning. There is so much to explore in ""The Conjuring"" and the mysterious atmosphere only helps to create the sense of fear. I've seen a lot of movies about possessions but none of them were as good as ""The Conjuring"" was. Sequences like the ""clap and hide"" game when Carolyn plays it with her daughter and we see the first paranormal appearance in the closet will be really hard to forget. But what makes ""The Conjuring"" really special it's the fact that there's a story, a really mysterious story, that the viewer could be easily attracted. I felt the characters fears and I kept wondering my self every time what the hell was going to happen next. I was scared for almost 2 hours but on the moment that those credits role, I knew I've just witnessed the living proof that it's still possible to make excellent horror movies. ""The Conjuring"" reaches a new level of intensity and creepiness that possessed me."
"kerryhill123","8","2","3","27 January 2014"," Pleasantly surprised
","In all honesty, I was never inclined at all to watch The Conjuring since most horrors that are massively talked about, mainly by teenagers, seem to almost always let me down, but this was an exception.<br/><br/>In hindsight, I should of been less doubtful as I rate James Wan as an extremely talented director who always seem to pull of scares. I enjoyed Saw and both of the Insidious films so The Conjuring was bound to be at least decent.<br/><br/>First off, I think the sound in this film was fantastic, it created suspense, tension and atmosphere and really made your skin crawl as you watched it. It perfectly suited the cinematography and was timed brilliantly. This was hardly a surprise really, and it did sound similar to the Insidious soundtrack. James Wan has a tendency to use contrapuntal sound and we definitely see this here. <br/><br/>The cinematography is extremely professional and effective, you see clear use of thirds and the different shots and angles were creative. A particular shot that caught my eye a couple of times was the rotation of the camera and upside down shots, these were unusual and interesting as well as a breath of fresh air into cinematography itself. If there was something important needed in the shot, it was always shown and also created plenty of false expectations in the viewer, which were unusually a good thing. <br/><br/>Acting was believable and honest, each character was played perfectly and naturally and there was no cheesy or conventional lines or performances. All actors showed genuine emotion and behaved in a manner that did the story line justice. And of course the story line was relatively impressive too, the story was dark,shocking and held the conventions of horror with interesting and original twists. <br/><br/>I must criticise the use of Annabelle the doll, since it really had little to do with the main story at all, I have heard about the proposed sequel but was there really any need to bring the doll into the equation in this film.<br/><br/>Either way, this film is definitely worth a watch if you want a genuinely scary horror movie and for once is actually based off a true story!"
"justpaigey","9","2","3","27 January 2014"," Thumbs up to James Wan on this movie!
","The Conjuring, a 2013 horror film directed by James Wan was based on the true events recorded by Ed and Lorraine Warren in the 1970's. The story sees a family experience supernatural occurrences shortly after they move into a new farmhouse. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson put forth a fantastic performance playing the Warrens alongside Lilli Taylor and Ron Livingston who played Carolyn and Rodger Perron.<br/><br/>Usually I have no real interest in watching films that are based on 'true events' as most seem to be overly dramatic and obviously fake. However, The Conjuring is by far my favourite horror film of 2013, the storyline was far-fetched (a witched who cursed the land possess the mother to kill the child) but at the same time was made to be very believable, I think this is partly because of all the marketing that the film put forth before release, these included 3 trailers and a featurette, which included the real family that the case studies where based on and an interview with Lorraine Warren. Most films that happen to be based on true events always turn out to be a hoax, Paranormal Activity for example claimed to be based on actual experiences when it was first brought out but then carried on to make numerous films and killed the original buzz of it being 'real'. Although, The Conjuring sequel that is being talked about may actually, like Paranormal Activity, ruin the 'buzz' if the storyline carried out to much. <br/><br/>There was a big focus on the Annabelle doll that featured in a few of the trailers and the opening scene of the movie. I must criticise the movie on this note because I think that this was really irrelevant, I know that there is talk for a spin off film based around the Annabelle doll but again I think this how no real relevance to the film itself. All in all I think the film is definitely worth a watch if you're a thrill seeker and love a good horror film! Thumbs up to James Wan on this film!"
"hollylouise22","8","2","3","27 January 2014"," A good film with very few criticisms
","The Conjuring had a budget of $20 million, this is quite a low budget for such a successful horror film. One reason this film became so popular because it was directed by James Wan, a well-known director of 'Saw' and 'Insidious' also the film was distributed by Warner Bros making it more successful because of its popularity. The Conjuring took 20 years to develop due to it being based on a true story, the element of it being based on a true story made it even more successful because true story films are becoming increasingly popular.<br/><br/>My view on the film is mostly positive, I found that the jumpy elements of the film and the music is what made this film a horror. Although there has been a lot of 'paranormal' type films, this one stood out as the story was based on a real family, which are in the featurette 'The Devils Hour'. However, I disliked this film because I found that towards the end it became too alike 'Paranormal Activity' which made it seem almost fake.<br/><br/>Overall I think this film did well, it stands out from other horror films and has become a huge success, I think the sequels will do well."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","7","2","3","14 January 2014"," Entertaining for what says is there
","Demonic possessions and hauntings are real and happen all the time – at least that's what the Warren family says. Here's the strange thing, it's not clear to whether the purpose of this movie was to terrify / entertain us or to make us believe that ghosts are real. Majority would say that the intention was for both reasons but that depends on one's experiences now doesn't it? Bring in someone who's not used to the horror genre and they'll believe anything you say,....but bring in regular gore hounds and nothing will phase them. I guess the whole concept is what you (the viewer) make it out to be.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is the story of two famous paranormal investigators of the last quarter of the 20th century, Lorraine and Ed Warren. When a family named the Perrons' move into a farmhouse, they begin to experience some very strange things about the house. Once noticed, they become terrified and call on the Warrens to help them find out if there really are ghosts in their house. That's where things become high strung. And in some cases too much for even the Warrens. Unfortunately that's because they took on a case they didn't see coming. Yes, even ghost hunters have their off days.<br/><br/>Acting wise, all the characterizations are believable; even for the no name actors who play the Perron family. But the two actors who do show that they were the right actors for the job was Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warren couple respectively. It's not that they gave their characters charm, but more on a human characteristic level. Although they could communicate with spirits, audiences will be able to feel that even with their special abilities, the risk is still high. That's the scary part that's what makes it dangerous. Both of their performances were the most memorable.<br/><br/>What may surprise viewers and fans alike is how little the violence appears throughout the running time. And although it's directed by James Wan, the guy behind the brutal Saw (2004) franchise, the basis of this movie's horror is in the suspense - not gore. That's the goal; suspense equals terror. This is how one makes a scary horror film. But, that doesn't mean the scenes that were set up to be terrifying, were as terrifying as it was said to be. A lot the scare scenes involve the derivative action of sudden loud noises and long pauses of silence that lead up to the sudden loud noises. The typical scream tactic. It does work in some areas though but most events are predictable. I only jumped twice and I honestly was expecting a much stronger, scarier presentation.<br/><br/>However, the scenes although typical in scares, did manage to pull off some very creepy imagery. Some of the sounds are really skin crawling - like old rickety wood cracking because it hasn't been moved in years. Or a door slowly opening with a very light creaking noise - oooh boy. The makeup looked good too. It some ways it resembled that of the Evil Dead (2013) possessed victims. The location of filming also helped with the imagery element. The house looked worn and petrified of dead souls to begin with. And lastly, Joseph Bishara's score to the film has a middling to effective listening experience. He definitely creates a dreaded theme with elongated counter string chords but it lacks the polish of other accomplished horror scores. Bishara's score is more bare bones than it is filling. It is an effective horror film but it's not as terrifying as it is said to be.<br/><br/>The musical score and scares lack the terrifying trait that fans may want, but the acting by the main leads are solid and the imagery is downright cringe worthy."
"kraveandrei","10","2","3","10 January 2014"," L'evocazione
","A very good movie horror.Probably the best new movie with all the visual effects.And the music of the movie is perfectly synchronized with this kind of genre. And the actors played very well in special Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in the roll of Ed and Lorraine Warren but also Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston in the roll of Carolyn and Roger Perron. This movie should be awarded with an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role for Patrick Wilson in my opinion.<br/><br/>And the director of the movie is also the one who directed Insidious,both chapters is also good at this job in this kind of genre. My vote for this movie is 10 out of 10 because i think that is a very good movie"

This movie had one instance of very mild blood, no cursing , no nudity no slashing.....and yet it wound up being the scariest movie I've seen! Loved it! Great acting, great story, great filming....great everything! This kicked butt over every ghost movie I've ever seen and is now my second favorite scary movie.

"tomsview","8","2","3","8 January 2014"," Demons and dolls
","When did the movies first discover how spooky dolls could be? As well as being one the scariest horror movies for a long while, ""The Conjuring"" also offers a pretty good entry in the spooky doll genre.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" doesn't waste any time trying to scare you, it's eerie from the get go.<br/><br/>The movie starts by introducing two renowned demonologists, Lorraine and Ed Warren played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Famiga, as scrolling text introduces their toughest case, ""Out of the thousands of cases throughout their controversial careers, there is one case so malevolent, they've kept it locked away until now"".<br/><br/>Although the film claims to be based on fact – there is plenty of information about it online – the movie is still a great ride on the ghost train even if you don't believe a word of it.<br/><br/>The movie cuts between Ed and Lorraine and their daughter Judy, and the seven-member Perron family, with Lili Taylor as Carolyn Perron, who ends up getting belted around like a contestant on ""Wipeout"". The Perrons move into a large, old two-story house and start to experience strange happenings. In the best tradition of ""Ghostbusters"" they call in the experts.<br/><br/>For a while, the story moves back and forth, bringing the Warrens and the Perrons together. As the Warrens work to exorcise the Perrons of their demons, after each scare, Ed and Lorraine give lucid explanations about paranormal activity – the film is so creepy that you find yourself mentally clinging to them like a palm tree in a hurricane, but eventually, they too are swept up in the demonic activity. In the end, both families are left fighting for their sanity and their lives.<br/><br/>Over the decades, filmmakers have learnt a lot about how to build the tension in this kind of movie. As ""The Conjuring"" shows, they don't always need spectacular effects, just a darkened hallway, a flight of cellar steps or a creaking door is enough to give a sense of dread.<br/><br/>On the scale of scary movies, this ranks right up there with ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Amityville Horror"" and actually has touches of both films, with even a hint of Hitchcock's ""The Birds"". <br/><br/>If you enjoy being creeped-out by a really good scary movie then you will get your money's worth with ""The Conjuring"", even if you know you are being manipulated by some of filmdom's most clichéd techniques. If you think you have seen these too many times for them to be effective, believe me, they will still have you jumping out of your seat in this cleverly-made movie."
"xllxlx","8","2","3","5 January 2014"," One of the better horror movies... creepy and tense...
","I saw this movie. I thought at times about turning a light on because it was persistently creepy. The movie seems original and when you predict something will happen, it doesn't. Much of the movie is creepy and tense.<br/><br/>There is one scene I do not think I will ever forget... and that is when a closet door opens near a blindfolded woman and then something else happened after that and I will not spoil it. That scene was weird and disturbing.<br/><br/>The ghost scenes are genuinely creepy. Few scenes or situations seemed borrowed from other movies. For the most part, this movie seemed original and it's better than most horror movies.<br/><br/>I give The Conjuring a honest 8 out of 10. A 8 out of 10 is the majority vote for The Conjuring on IMDb right now too and I agree with it. The Conjuring is not perfect, certain scenes could've been done in a better way certainly or excluded, but its a lot better than most horror movies."
"d-wyatt25","10","2","3","4 January 2014"," Excellent Old School Scare
","If you haven't seen this film yet, do yourself a favour and watch it ASAP. Simply put, it is a good old fashioned scare that relies on a good story, compelling acting, beautiful cinematography and a fantastic score. James Wan really is the master when it comes to timely scares. The use of the score in this film to build anticipation is superb. You can connect and relate to the characters almost immediately and the scares are actually scary which is unusual for a modern day horror. It has all the old school scare tactics, bumps in the night, possession, exorcisms, dark cellars and well children, who make a lot of scary films in my opinion. It doesn't resort to grotesque measures to scare the audience, instead it plays on our real fears, supernatural paranormal activity that is hard to explain and even harder to deal with. Vera Farmiger and Patrick Wilson were cast perfectly and have a real chemistry in the film, and the back-story is clear and well presented without having to resort to long trails of dialogue or extended flashbacks that interrupt the mood and suspense of the film. All in all this is just a fantastic movie for any horror fan, I saw it some time ago at the cinema and I can't wait to see the sequel which has already been agreed upon."
"shadyacres","9","2","3","26 December 2013"," Wow, a brilliant modern day horror for once.
","OK so I am disappointed every time I watch a modern day thriller/horror. They are always badly scripted with plenty of unfilled gaps in the story, totally predictable and they recycle material over and over again from the classics such as: Scream, Halloween, Poltergeist and Friday the 13th. A typical detail used in today's horror films is the line 'based on a true story' which you know is totally bo**ocks. However, after doing a bit of research into this film I was soon to discover that the Warrens, the paranormal investigators in the film, were and are actually real people that experienced many well documented paranormal activities such as the Amityville Horror and the haunting in Connecticut (both now made into average films). So for me The Conjuring is a wonderful surprise. The acting is brilliant and well lead by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, the use of make-up and prosthetics over CGI adds extra realism to the scares that the ghosts deliver and actually stay put in your mind. The film grips you with excellent suspense techniques throughout the whole thing and there was many times where I was peering at the screen through my fingers. After being disappointed by James Wan's Insidious and Insidious 2, I was sceptical about giving this film a chance, but I am so glad I did, because what those other two films lacked this one gained."

(in a good way... I highly recommend this movie). This is the best psychological thriller that has been made in years.<br/><br/>This is a great film. It is extremely well made, well written, and well acted. It is based on a true story and, while I know that Hollywood takes great latitude with the 'true story' films in adding drama, I don't feel this one went too far at all.

The movie does have some flaws which includes a familiar plot but some amazing acting, cinematography, style etc sets it apart from others, credit to James Wan for that.<br/><br/>I feel just when horror movies were losing its true identity and gory movies were being called horror, movies like Insidious, Mama etc are a step in the right direction in reviving this genre.

"davidcoverman","8","2","3","10 November 2013"," Which is scarier!?!!?: A house full of girls or a house full of ghosts? Or my review of The Conjuring
","""The Conjuring"" is a... well, is a great film. Much like my review on ""Elysium"" I was going to say ""is a great horror film"" but unlike my reserved genre labeling holding back my opinion of praising that film as a ""science fiction film"", this hesitation at such labeling as simply a great 'horror film' is actually in praise of the movie here. Horror films can so easily be dismissed onto the pile of shock gore fest splatter films and the like, that when a real well made scary film comes along, it really does stand out.<br/><br/>I read some other review I don't remembers who's but they pointed out the first thing I too noticed. There is an opening prologue of sorts, with it's stark title card, revealing a previous haunting that made this movie have all the earmarks of the aspirations of making a movie to the likes of ""The Exorcist"". While it's fails to deliver on the scale of that horror epic that fact it comes close to that cinematic high mark in terror, is something to commend indeed.<br/><br/>Compared to a movie like James Wan's previous excellent Insidious which dealt in parallel universes and plains of existence etc this one was shackled by ""based on"" or ""inspired by"" or whatever they framed this one with the ""true events"" setting. And while that gray area or ""dark"" gray area, if you must, may extend to a lot of leeway in the levitation people and objects etc... there are some things you just want to say are true for sure, like this family had five girls ranging from pre-school to high school age. In fact, the person I saw this with and I were humorously trying to keep track, when they had a shot of four of the girls heading to school and we thought we had it... until we were reminded of the pre-school girl! Any sane scriptwriter would have lessened the madness of the reality in this scenario!<br/><br/>But like when the paranormal specialists are brought in along with a local officer the actual mayhem of a simple breakfast among such a crowd was almost comical in presenting this as a real situation. But any comic relief or quite moments were certainly offset with real scares and jumps.<br/><br/>As film progresses you actually find time to separate out the girls, understand the foreboding of the paranormal specialist and her history, and the shear stamina of the parents played by Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston who obviously had their hands full even before they bought the to-good-to-be true countryside deal of a house from the bank.(When you buy something ""as is"" in an auction you're probably hoping for some simple water damage not a house full of ghosts...) Anyway the way the interaction of all these people happen really draws you into an investment to liking these people even the paranormal investigators Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson illicit great empathy for them and all the children actresses, and so when one girl starts sleep walking, or the covers are pulled off another, or one sees a little boy in the mirror of a toy, the creepiness factor really builds.<br/><br/>Now eventually things build from the simple scare of a night gowned girl suddenly passing in the frame, to objects and people actually being thrown around the house, plus there's ""The Sixth Sense"" like visions people have of past suicides and such, that build up to the real scare of the mother slowly becoming possessed by the evil presence that was supposedly the start of all the others.<br/><br/>And while it's true most of the chills and thrills are all done without any blood and gore I suppose it's the gruesome possession and exorcism that really give it it's R rating.<br/><br/>The idea of ""specialists"" seems to have garnered weight ever since the creepy little lady in Poltergeist, for instance, even though the investigators Patrick and Vera's characters are based on real ""investigators"" Ed and Lorraine Warren that wasn't important to films like the original ""The Amityville Horror"" movie even though the same two were involved in the case because at that time the only ""specialist"" most people associated with evil in the movies would be a priest.<br/><br/>Even though this movie supposedly took place around the same time as original ""The Exorcist"" that movie treated science as baffled and completely inadequate with what cursed little Regan. Whereas this movie incorporates the sympathies of science to assure the couple that they ""aren't going crazy"". With investigative tools of the time: automatic triggering camera, temperature changing sensors, and super sensitive audio equipment etc.. no infrared or ectoplasm thingamajigs of modern day, but you get the idea. But even here, of course, logic, science and all that tries to give the family foothold on sanity are subjected to pure evil that must be cast out with old fashion exorcism<br/><br/>The possessed devil doll from the prologue tying in with the Warren's daughter had some true suspension and horror to it, but was almost was like Wan had bitten off a bit more than he could chew unlike the mom who bit off a piece of the police officer's cheek causing them to throw sheet over her head..ha!comic relief So even though the daughter subplot was a stretch, and the ending is a bit extreme in it's chaotic deliverance from evil for the family as children are trapped beneath floor boards or in the car or I forget where all, the unrivaled suspense that got us there to the turmoil and whirlwind of an ending is truly terrifying and extremely well done."

","The thing I dislike in most movies is when they pretend to be expensive, clever and scary on the surface, but just scratch at it a little and it easily reveals itself to be a cheap and unoriginal copy of a much better masterpiece, in this case The Exorcist, The Changeling and Amityville Horror.<br/><br/>I like a good spooky horror movie. I enjoy every second of The Exorcist because it is a well-crafted piece of art that has stood the test of time. Each viewing reveals new aspects to cherrish. The same goes for The Omen or Rosemary's Baby. A good story is worth more than a huge budget. The Conjuring is an insult to horror. It is the laziest writing combined with the most basic direction. It has nothing new or good to offer to the genre, but instead sets it back decades.<br/><br/>James Wan is not a fraud like Andy Muschietti, but his over-reliance on jumpscares and loud noises is proof he can't write or direct a scary movie. Robert Eggers and Ari Aster are ten times better writer-directors who create better movies with a lesser budget because they rely on good storytelling to create moods, not loud noises and bad lighting.<br/><br/>Aside the fact that the Warrens were frauds who preyed on the misery and pain of others, the constant beating over the head with religion and quackery is insulting. James Wan profits off the gullibility and bad taste of moviegoers. Too much exposition, cheap jumpscares and a forgettable plot nowadays equals profit. Unfortunately."

""The Conjuring"" surprised me with how well the storyline was done and the characters were developed, especially Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga). Lili Taylor ""Carolyn"" did an exceptionally good job as struggling mother of five hyper daughters who had just moved into a VERY extraordinary house (haunted that is). And Ron Livingston, as the dad ""Roger Perron"", filled his role adequately. There was definitely a 70's atmosphere with the music played, hairstyles, automobiles and slang spoken. All of which set a background for the terror to slowly unfold for the family as they tried to adjust to their new home. From things grabbing little girls under the bed, ghosts in the basement, to a grotesque witch attacking a child from atop wardrobe furniture, to the demonic possession of their mother, a lot HELL happens to the Perron family. The evil house even takes out their poor family dog! For a movie that has very little cursing, no nudity and not at ton of gore it sure does deliver intense horror.

"TheMovieDiorama","9","1","1","23 April 2019"," The Conjuring summons intelligent camera trickery to produce one of the best horrors of the decade.
","James Wan is an innovator when it comes to crafting horror pictures. He cemented his technical capabilities with 'Saw' and perfected his invigorating essence for the supernatural in 'Insidious'. The Conjuring is a culmination of his previous work, including 'Dead Silence', and an absolute masterclass in horror filmmaking that, to my mind, does not get enough acclaim. It spawned a ""Conjuring Cinematic Universe"" and paved the way for future, albeit low quality, spiritual imitations from rising talents within the industry. It tells the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren, real-life paranormal investigators, depicting one of their lesser known cases involving the Perron family and the ominous hauntings in their new house.<br/><br/>On the surface, it resembles a standard supernatural mystery involving the recruitment of religious individuals to save a family from turmoil, concluding in an exorcism of some kind and cleansing the afflicted's soul from demonic possession. The Hayes' screenplay does not stray too far away from that formula, but offers some deeper character development along the way, particularly the Warrens and the matriarch of the Perrons. Mostly concerning parenthood and the need to protect children from external influences, the wretched Annabelle doll acting as a conduit for this symbol. However, that is not what sets The Conjuring apart from the competition.<br/><br/>What differentiates this, or I should say who, is James Wan. The talent this man upholds is relentless, no exaggeration. Goosebumps appearing on your arms or hairs on the back of your neck standing up is all because of his expert ability to craft horror. The way he manoeuvres the camera, whether it be a slow tilt up to the top of a wardrobe where a demonic woman precariously perches, or long arduous takes prowling the dark hallways switching between POV and over-the-shoulder shots, he immediately creates suspense. Silenced music, ghostly whispers and dimmed lighting. All of these technical aspects, from the eerie sound effects to the incredibly detailed production design, result in pure palpable tension. Unknowingly you start sweating, nervously waiting to see what Wan has in store for you. A horrific game of ""hide and clap"". A hellish doll writing notes. Or perhaps the chaotic exorcism that will render you speechless as furniture is flying from every direction.<br/><br/>Jump scares are present, but they are warranted. Not because they are unexpected, but because they executed correctly. Most of the horror comes from the suspense and invigorating mystery that the Warrens find themselves in. Speaking of the Warrens, Wilson and Farmiga were just delightful. Able to bring out heart stopping emotion when strengthening their relationship and correctly reacting to scenes of terror. Taylor was also excellent, even when screaming ""Rogerrrrr!"" about twenty times. The daughters were all decent also, despite not having a huge amount of screen time shared between them all.<br/><br/>I mean, what else can I say? The Conjuring, for me, is the pinnacle of modern mainstream horror. It follows a formula, modernises it using innovative techniques and a captivating story, and delivers fully on the scares. James Wan is the current master of horror, and this film is the perfect showcase of his talents. I've seen it a good fifteen times, and so many scenes still frighten the life out of me..."

"Grismar","7","1","1","7 February 2019"," Effective and good looking, but nothing new
","The characters are likeable and the movie establishes itself pretty quickly, with some very effective scares and spooks. For anyone who like the typical 'family moves into haunted house' type movie, The Conjuring will be an enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>But many movies like it have been made and The Conjuring doesn't add that much we haven't seen before. The one aspect I did like is how the psychics that get involved really get involved and the stakes are raised considerably during the movie.<br/><br/>But like others have said, it's set in the 70's to make it work the way it does and this is mainly because horror movie writers and directors will need to get creative to make horror for the current age. Setting it in the 70's allows for all the familiar tropes and makes for a nostalgic horror environment. Asian movies like Ring show that there is room for something new and modern, so I don't agree that setting it in the 80's or 70's is a requirement for the genre.<br/><br/>A niggle I had with The Conjuring is that the tone shifts quite a lot. After some considerable buildup, the movie loses a lot of steam and even though it does build up after that, it's a lot slower and I felt it never quite achieved the atmosphere it has about a third in."

Patrick Wilson (Who most people know from Insidious and The Phantom of the Opera) and Vera Farmiga (Best known for Bates Motel) have amazing chemistry and certainly pull off the power couple. The movie focuses quite a bit on their relationship while still focusing on horror."
"MJB784","6","1","1","21 May 2018"," Occasionally scary
","As a horror movie, it had some scares, but as a story, it wasn't that surprising. Though it is based on a true story and I love haunted house movies, these kinds of films have lost their surprise. It seemed like a cross between Insidious (directed by James Wan also) and Sinister. Insidious also dealt with demonic possession (in fact, one old lady that was also a ghost in Conjuring looked like the same one in Insidious) and Sinister, which also deals with demonic possession, features the characters moving into a house that was previously haunted already and those that enter are in danger. So basically, there weren't many surprises, but I wish we knew more about the ghosts. We don't know the names of these demons or where they came from (other than Hell) and some of the ghosts appear in one scene and have nothing to do with the movie. As a horror fan, it does have scares, but I think they should have a new approach to the haunted house genre. I still say The Others was the best of the haunted house movies (though I haven't seen Amityville Horror). Overall, I guess if you haven't seen the two horror movies I've mentioned, it would be scarier. So I'm on the fence with this one."

We must not forget the camera angels that make you look (or look away) out instead of the charactors watching out for themselves, i think it was really effective.

The movie is so great, that even those less than a few jump scares are crazy good unlike that classical cringy approach to jump scare scenes."
"ikhwan_arif","8","1","1","22 April 2018"," High Quality Fright Night Experience
","James Wan successfully made a compelling demonic possession film loosely based on true accounts. Written by Chad Hayes, the technical detail here is praiseworthy and the acting all around is convincing and competent.<br/><br/>There are so many layers here to peel. Firstly is the story of Ed and Lorraine Warren - played with great prowess by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, are the paranormal investigators finds as well as debunks activities of the unknown. Chad Hayes was very clever in including moments were the Warrens are skeptical and actively try to find more rational explanations of things going bump in the night, which gives credence to the what happens to the Porren family in the story. <br/><br/>The Porrens are the family being haunted; I won't say by since part of the fun is to discover the motivation behind the possession. Special commendation must be given to Lili Taylor for her performance as you'll discover in the end, while Ron Livingstone is believable as the bewildered father. <br/><br/>However, the star of the show is definitely, James Wan; whose direction, clever use of light and shadow, silence and sound as well as tight camera angles, gives you a thoroughly psychologically eerie atmosphere that keeps you in a state of suspense for most of the film. This is old school horror film with refined technical finesse. <br/><br/>If I had any criticism of the film, it's the demon that is doing the haunting, could have been more sinister, such as devil in The Exorcist (1973). <br/><br/>A really good ghost story. Recommended."
"nodlimax","8","1","1","7 March 2018"," Good horror movie - a few to many jump scares towards the end
","I like the movie and think it is pretty scary.<br/><br/>In terms of the horror and shock effects there is a steady escalation in what happens to the character so that you are always asking yourself ""what comes next?"".<br/><br/>I also like the fact that they really focussed on the story why the stuff is happening. They left out unnecessary things like drama surrounding the paranormal specialists not being taken seriously and so on. It felt refreshing.<br/><br/>Some of the decisions made by the characters are not relatable though as I think staying in the house the way they are after the first few occurences was a mistake. At least let everybody sleep in the same room so they can help each other.<br/><br/>In addition towards the end there were a few to many jump scares. They work quite well with the sound effects, but still they are pretty cheap."

The Conjuring was released in the United States and Canada on July 19, 2013, and received positive reviews from critics. It grossed over $319 million worldwide against its $20 million budget, making it one of the highest-grossing horror films of all time.

","'The Conjuring (2013)' represents a wonderful marriage of two very different yet complementary schools of film-making, that being the vintage suspense of the sixties and seventies with the snappy scares of today's show-not-tell mentality, and as such it is a brilliantly tangible slow-burn of a piece that isn't afraid to earn its eventual scares. Almost an hour is dedicated to character set-up and subtle 'bumps in the night' which - unlike in the old-school movies it draws inspiration from - then transform into overt horror in the feature's fantastically frenzied final act. It's the combination of the older, more tangible techniques with the overtly supernatural story that isn't afraid to go all out - not to mention the bigger budget and today's technical ability - that makes for an amazingly affecting and enjoyable piece that has several sequences of genuine suspense that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

The Warrens tried to help the original owners and tell us that the demon tricked them into letting him possess them by using Annabelle as a decoy. The specifically say that the owners are the ones that are actually possessed in saying that. From here the story should end once they died; but lets say the demon actually moves into Annabelle just so its possible that others can be possessed in the story later. <br/><br/>Remember: You have to invite the demon into your life. <br/><br/>How in the hell does this story continue? Above I said lets assume the demon goes into Annabelle so, lets just go along with it and say that is permission to possess anyone that has the doll.<br/><br/>BUT... the story messes up that literally minutes later. <br/><br/>The Warrens have a collection of possessed and haunted items they collected over the years for everyone elses safety. This requires a monthly visit and blessing by a priest to ensure they themselves aren't risking harm. After the original owners died; the Warrens took Annabelle and added her to their collection. They even make her a special case with a extra warning label not to touch her.<br/><br/>How can the new owners of the old Annabelle house, in which the movie centers around, be having any issues when:<br/><br/>A.

"zkonedog","7","1","1","5 March 2017"," A Film With ""Jumps""...But Also A Good Story
","Horror films admittedly are not my favorite genre of film, but when I'm watching a good one it is usually a pretty engrossing experience for me. All too often, horror flicks are just full of ""cheap scares"" that are good for getting the boys to wrap their arms a little tighter around their girlfriends. While ""The Conjuring"" does provide those moments, it also tells a pretty good demonic possession story along the way.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Conjuring"" tells the story of Roger (Ron Livingstone), Carolyn (Lili Taylor), and their five daughters who move into a new house that they quickly discover is infested by demonic forces. As such, demonologists Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are called in to try and subdue the hauntings.<br/><br/>Obviously, the first criteria any horror movie is judged by is quite simple: is it scary? ""The Conjuring"" easily passes that test, as not only does it have some of the requisite ""jump moments"", but also some psychological terror as well. It pretty much single-handedly brought the kids game of ""hide-and-clap"" back into national consciousness.<br/><br/>Beyond the scares, though, the movie tells a pretty intriguing story revolving around demonic possession. In fact, I actually thought the film could have focused even more on those areas (adding more of a ""God vs. Devil"" aspect) in order to gain the five-star ranking, but it is still interesting nonetheless. Clearly, director James Wan (also director of the first few ""Saw"" movies) knows how to weave a compelling story into a scary narrative.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the experience of ""The Conjuring"". It isn't in my top echelon of scary movies (Halloween, Saw, The Ring), but it is far better than most slashers or gore-fests."
"werdnaoslek","6","1","1","22 June 2016"," My feelings on the 2013 box office smasher ""The Conjuring""
","This modern horror flick was released in 2013 by James Wan. It's mostly just an average ghost movie dealing with supernatural themes that we've seen before. There's nothing wrong with these old school scare tactics, just nothing too original or creative about them either.<br/><br/>The premise of this movie revolves around a family of seven, with five daughters moving into a cursed home. It doesn't take long before creaks are heard throughout the house and doors mysteriously open on their own. Once the mother asks for help from experts of the supernatural, The Warrens further investigation of the house reveals a dark spirit and a cursed land with a bloody history. The supernatural occurrences become more prevalent as the film goes on until the climax around the last twenty minutes of the movie. As far as plot goes, this movie plays it relatively safe by sticking to every genre cliché there is. The family dog senses the evil presence before the humans do prior to being killed off, the youngest daughter bears a friendship with a person that's not there (presumably a ghost), the oldest daughter is grumpy with the parents for even moving houses and the children believe they see things before the parents barge in to tell them it was all a dream. There is also awkwardly forced in 70's slang in one scene as if outdated electrical appliances weren't convincing enough in the film. The acting through these clichés was decent for both the child actors and the adult actors. The adult actors were nothing special but were convincing of the role, the weakest of them being the actor for the father, Ron Livingston. It could have been just a matter of direction or the material he was given, but there was never an opportunity to learn anything about his character other than the fact that he is a father and retains fatherly responsibilities such as rescuing his family members from ghosts. There wasn't anything special he brought to his performance, although the lack of material he was given is also to blame. The child actors were surprisingly not terrible for child actors and were all convincing in the most crucial scenes that could easily have been ruined if they were lazy about their performances. The children did fade back and forth from being credible characters to observably out of character, like cracking a small smile in a serious situation.<br/><br/>The film has its moments and the well-used musical score adds to these moments, but I felt like we needed more of a reason to care about the characters the story centered around, particularly at the end of the movie with the actor for the mother, Lili Taylor. Lili Taylor was fitting as the mother, and the father character could really have been cast as anybody. There aren't any concepts introduced in this movie that are genuinely new or fascinating that I have not seen before. This movie felt very similar to 'Insidious', another title that James Wan directed himself and concerned ghosts and possession. Although cliché and seen before in movies like 'The Exorcist', and 'Child's Play', James Wan is really good at unsettling visuals. The supernatural theme is dealt with in a way that makes it hard to determine whether the visuals are in the dream of a character or are real, and it was interesting to keep seeing. Some of that subtlety is lost by the end of the movie, but the climax is still enjoyable. There are a few jumpscares in this movie, a much- beloved scare tactic in modern horror. These are luckily not overused as ineffective scares. There is some purpose to them, and they were kept to a minimum in the film. The tone of this movie is done well and there is some suspense that I enjoyed. The thing that bogs this film down the most is how safe it stays. It's definitely a better modern horror movie, but it sticks to classic roots of horror. I'm very reluctant to see The 'Saw' franchise on account of how ridiculous it looks, so it is good to see something like this that I hope is a shred more intelligent than nonstop gore and jumpscares thanks to Saw and anything given from Eli Roth.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film, but I can't see much rewatchability. This movie holds up for now against titles like Paranormal activity but doesn't hold up against other horror classics<br/><br/>+ Decent child acting - Often cliché + creepy visuals - Characters don't go anywhere<br/><br/>6/10"
"filmfanperspective","8","1","1","5 May 2015"," Over-hyped, but strong and occasionally terrifying
","""The Conjuring"", does an excellent job of balancing tense and horrific moments, while simultaneously balancing itself between the ridiculous and the serious. I can say with confidence that although I wasn't truly frightened at any point, this film held me in suspense the entire time. It is important to note that in no way do I actually believe any of this movie, or any story with a similar premise, to be true. The focus in popular culture on ghosts, the supernatural, and the unholy is quite the snooze-fest for me. That being said, I'm open to suspending disbelief for a film about such subjects, provided that it isn't too heavy-handed and preachy. Director James Wan (""Saw"", ""Insidious"") does a masterful job of showcasing the ghost busting Warren couple (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) as a grounded, focused team that at least tries to use scientific methods to back their work up. In this setting, I'm game for that, and although we're given a couple of on-screen notes about the 'true' nature of this story, it isn't shoved down our throat. Again, a balanced approach.<br/><br/>The film is centered around a single case the Warrens worked, albeit not the one they are most famous for (the ""The Amityville Horror"" is centered around that particular case). Until I saw this film, I wasn't familiar with the Warrens themselves. Apparently they investigated many 'supernatural' cases, and as the film tells us at the beginning, this one was the 'most harrowing'. Of course it was.<br/><br/>The Warrens are at a speaking engagement when they are urged, at the insistence of the mother (Lili Taylor), to come and see an old house in the country that the Perron family of seven has just moved into. Things arehappening at the house that can't be explained. All the clocks stop at 3:07 AM. There are randomly banging doors. The family pet meets doom. The smell of rotting meat is prevalent. Most importantly, the daughters are frightened, and after a particularly harrowing incident, the weary family decides to take action. It takes the initially skeptical Warrens only a few minutes at the house to be clear that something is amiss.<br/><br/>In a sequence of scenes straight out of the ""Poltergeist"" playbook, a metric ton of 'analyzing' equipment is brought in to help provide evidence that the Perron's house does, indeed, need an exorcism. That's right, a whole house exorcism. The family can't leave, either, because this 'demon' will follow them. Bummer. What follows, though, is a consistently tense stream of events, where the clairvoyant Lorraine Warren sees terrible images, and the presence in the house toys with everyone. Why does it toy with this family? The reason is given, but I would venture a guess and say that this entity can only grow powerful by striking at the heart of the family, and breaking their bonds. Destroying things like family photos, and killing pets, is one way to do such a thing.<br/><br/>What could be ridiculous in ""The Conjuring"" is not- this is all well constructed and edited, for there are neither dull moments, nor wasted scenes of needless exposition. The tension level is high until the very end of the film, and never lets up. There's a point in any thriller where the film can stand pat, and things go as expected, or the boundaries are stretched. This is one of the films where the stakes seem higher, and the antagonist unpredictable. At one point, not only does the affected family deal with the disturbance, but the Warrens themselves deal with the spook's wrath. That unnerved me- the rules seemed to change on the spot, and I wondered what, exactly, the supernatural nemesis was going to do next.<br/><br/>A few smaller details deserve mentioning. The title sequence of the film, which scrolls up, is a nice throwback to titles past. The font is oversized, and clearly not a subtle yellow. It certainly caught my attention, and got me thinking something unique was forthcoming, not to mention a grin on my face. I've also got to give the film credit, for there are many 'jump' moments, but they're timed just right. For subject matter we've seen many times now, I appreciated the attention to detail. The dark corners were somehow more menacing than I remember, the shrieking music at critical moments hit just right, the tree in the Perron's yard was appropriately jagged, and the visceral reactions from the actors gave what should be a throwaway film some gravity. Tonally, this film's got it where it counts.<br/><br/>Interestingly, in the course of writing this, I've realized that it's possible I will never be scared watching a movie again. Either a horror film tries too hard and gives away an upcoming scare, there's too much gore and it becomes silly, or it's full of torture or shock 'porn', and I just feel depressed more than anything. Maybe that's what getting older is like. Maybe we're only scared by what we don't know or understand, and thus being scared is a childish reaction. Maybe (this is a stretch) we're so used to the world being more horrific than a horror film that nothing surprises us in the theater anymore. That being the case, I give extra props to ""The Conjuring"" for jarring me at all, and I dare any other film to do better."
"Christopher_Reid","8","1","1","29 April 2015"," Not original or deep but highly effective and entertaining as a horror
","Horror movies never make me jump. It's extremely rare. I'm usually not even tense. But The Conjuring kept me pretty tense for most of its duration. I was almost frustrated by how it was scaring me in a subtle, simple way I had no control over. I didn't jump but there were many parts that sent involuntary chills down my spine. Whenever the movie suggests an ominous presence or that something sinister is about to happen, you cannot help but buy into it and start imagining and anticipating things. James Wan is very successful at manipulating his audience with all the horror movie tricks that there are. In this way, The Conjuring works really well. I'm usually very underwhelmed by the directing and acting in horror movies but this is a nice exception.<br/><br/>The Conjuring manages to avoid annoying us for the most part. The characters aren't complete idiots. However, they still manage to leave out important details when talking with each-other. And they are conveniently separated or put into vulnerable positions a lot of times. But the aim is to scare and it works. You have to sometimes accept that the lights aren't going to work and that people might be dumb enough to play blindfold games in a haunted house. And of course they can't just move out because, well... because money. Anyway, the plot keeps moving and it's engaging all the way through. Bits of information are revealed in a very effective way that build the suspense and dread. The climax is quite dramatic and satisfying. Fairly intense, but not retarded.<br/><br/>There are many similarities to Paranormal Activity. That film possibly had less plot-holes and maintained more mystery. It also didn't claim to be based on a true story. But The Conjuring has much more character- depth and humour. We really care about the family and the investigators. There are probably lots of similarities to The Exorcist as well, but I found that film to be highly over-rated. At least The Conjuring is far less boring. And much scarier. It taps more into universal fears whereas The Exorcist seems to benefit from some religious beliefs which I don't carry.<br/><br/>I was a bit annoyed when I looked into the story behind this movie. Why base it so loosely on a true story? There are way too many liberties taken. I invested a certain amount of trust in the story, that most of it actually happened. There appears to be practically no evidence of much of any of it having taken place. Most of the history seems to be completely false. Because so many stupid, inconsistent details were thrown together, they should have made this a pure work of fiction. Then you could laugh afterwards about how creative and scary and ridiculous it was.<br/><br/>The Conjuring generally avoids cheap scares and focuses on being creepy and having original moments (in style, not in story). James Wan knows what we're expecting and where we're looking and uses this to his advantage. He makes us stare into a rotating mirror, helplessly searching for the slightest hint of an image so we can empty our bowels the instant we see it. He makes us stare into the darkness, waiting for some malevolent being or force to make itself known. The house and surrounding environment are both shot really well. They look really cool.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a really good horror movie, but it feels a bit dishonest. I mean, they record video in the movie but is there any footage of what they got that the public can see? Are we meant to believe ghosts exist and hauntings actually happen but somehow there's absolutely no solid evidence of them at all? Clearly I don't. But I guess the Warrens were convinced and we should at least respect their sincerity."

","The Conjuring is one HELL of a horror film. It grips you from the opening minutes, and doesn't let go till the end. It provides the viewer with a typical set-up of a family moving to a haunted house, before proceeding to frighten the wits out of them (and us, by extension). It manages to shove aside the standard 'bump in the night' cliché that's present in so many recent entries in the genre redundant, and sticks us in a nail-biting atmosphere where we literally have NO IDEA what's coming next.<br/><br/>Most of all, the people in it aren't just targets to be dragged around by their hair ,have objects tossed at them or possessed by EVIL SPIRITS (though all that happens, too). These are children acting like children, parents who would do anything to protect their kids and a pair of devoted paranormal investigators that have so much depth and personality they utterly obliterate the 'comedy' ghost hunters from movies like Insidious. In other words, WE CARE. Believe it or not, this is more difficult than it sounds.<br/><br/>For once, the human element is as important as the shocks, and all the participants are well drawn and two dimensional characters we want to survive this living nightmare. As for, lets face it, what EVERYONE came for (the supernatural angle) it starts off slow, with a few odd occurrences... Mysterious bruises discovered on the mother in the morning... One of the daughters sleep walking at night repeatedly into a closed wardrobe... And then things REALLY start to pick up around the time the dog (Who refused to enter the property, with good reason) is discovered mutilated on the front porch. OUCH.<br/><br/>See this film. ENCOURAGE GOOD HORROR MOVIE PRODUCTION, since it's a genre so difficult to get right. Oh, and you DO discover a shut-off, boarded-up secret room in your new home... best leave it alone... It's most likely that way for a REASON. 7/10"

","Audiences enjoy being scared so much that they'll pay $12 to see crappy horror films the first weekend they open. They'll love ""The Conjuring,"" except that it isn't crappy and is actually, you know, scary! We've seen ghost movies like this for years. We still can't get over the unpredictable fright of spirits popping out of nowhere and terrorizing people in some old house. Vera Farminga and Patrick Wilson play paranormal investigators named Ed and Lorraine Warren. Like every horror film trying to sell tickets, we see ""based on a true story"" stuck to the poster before entertaining the theater. I know I know, but come on! We're supposed to fooled! Ed and Lorraine investigate an old mysterious house in the middle of nowhere that a family moved into. What could go wrong? Why do horror movie characters always live in some creepy old house! The opening of ""The Conjuring"" is a little strange and laughable. The real beauty behind James Wan's directing is he makes it suspenseful instead of gory. We never know what demon with a fork in his butt is going to do next to these poor people. Even the credits at the end are terrifying! Wan takes a while for the horror to start kicking in. He makes tiny little clues that something is up, then delivers frightening sequences of scary fun. The one thing I would have taken out is the (SPOILER ALERT) exorcisms. Possessed people screaming their heads of is a little peculiar and not that scary. ""The Conjuring"" isn't too original or artistic, but it's pure fun to scream your bloody head off. Wan is full of suspense and terror in his directing and he'll keep you hungry for more. See it in a big group. Boo!"

","I made a conjugal visit (well, maybe not conjugal) to the horror flick ""The Conjuring"", and it was pretty satisfying. The movie stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed & Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators in the early 70's. Ron Livingston & Lili Taylor co-star as Roger & Carolyn Perron, parents of five females who move into a two- story haunting, I mean haunted, farmhouse. So who you gonna call? The Warrens of course for a Warren investigation to lift the spirits, away that is. Director James Wan does wanna keep us spooked, and does a good job of it. The thespian fems Farmiga & Taylor do stand out with their work here, while Wilson & Livingston should have been scared away from the set with their humdrum performances.

","It has been quite a few decades in my opinion of true horror genre films that completely exemplify the meaning. Not since Salems Lot has there been a more gripping and terrifying film. The creator and mind behind the Saw franchise has completely turned the horror genre back on in full force. There are some similarities between this film and Amittyville but the structure of this film just grips the audience. The editing and the general ambiance or feel of this film just gives the viewer goosebumps and tingles. I was amazed at the story and how effective the acting was from Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson. Lilli Taylor is amazing as the mother and keep your eyes on the kids in this film as they have great chemistry.

"f-segretto","9","1","1","17 September 2014"," An authentic review
","The Conjuring is an enthralling, beautifully filmed horror movie that stays with someone long after they've finished watching it. It depicts the true story of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren and the most malevolent case they've ever encountered. The film immediately grabs the viewer in its opening commencement, and doesn't let go until the climax's reached and resolution is affirmed. The screenplay and honest, authentic portrayal given by all the actors brings the film to life and makes the audience solely focused on the characters and not the scary, traumatic events constantly occurring. The pace of horror movies seems like such a patent thing to get correct and yet so often is overlooked and results in discontent for many viewers. Another rare feat of this riveting, complex film is it exclusively scares its audience without gore or excessive violence. The direction of James Wan is also incredibly invaluable. These focal points are some of the prominent reasons why critics are calling The Conjuring ""The most effective haunt of this generation!"" The dialogue between the characters gives the audience a genuine feel of whom each character really is without taking time away from the central plot. This presents the audience with a unique opportunity to sympathize with everything the characters are being put through. It is utterly unconventional for an audience to feel (or want to feel) any kind of emotion or anxiety for people in horror movies. The audience ultimately wants the characters to overcome the insidious obstacles the haunted home of the Perrons has in waiting for them. The film's success is related predominantly to one individual: James Wan. James Wan is the director of The Conjuring and consistently becoming more and more well known and respected in the horror movie genre due to this recent masterpiece. Wan takes common themes and aspects from modern horror films while being able to incorporate tricks from Old Hollywood and still make it all compatible with each other. Wan himself stated himself that the MPAA could not take anything out because the entire thing was just too frightening. The pace of any movie is so imperative to the viewers engaging and staying interested in the film. The Conjuring is interesting from the very beginning to the very end because of its impeccable pace. The film starts off by introducing the Warrens and how they go about handling their paranormal investigations. The tone in the very beginning is eerie and makes the audience feel somewhat unnerved because of the few, subtle inklings given. The ambiance of the film intricately takes on a creepier tone when the Perron family is introduced. The Perrons' home is brimming with infinite entities that are the stuff of the most disturbing nightmares. These incredibly unsettling, early incidents include helpful sleepwalking, the death of their pet dog, inanimate objects being thrown, etc. These supernatural happenings occur much more frequently when the Warrens get involved and start investigating the Perrons' home; the disturbances then take on a whole other terrifying level. The scares of this movie aren't rushed, but yet the audience doesn't feel like they're waiting an eternity for them either. The scares that many label as ""jumpy scares"" don't just momentarily frighten you; they genuinely startle you and make you more discomposed and anxious than ever before. The pace of the film is executed to perfection. The Conjuring is rated R for one distinct reason. The film itself has no nudity or sexual conduct, no foul language, or any extreme blood and violence. Why then, one may ponder, is the film rated R? Well, it is in fact rated R because of how terrifying it is. The movie leans on anticipation scares throughout the duration of the film. The scares are so accurately placed that throughout the entire movie, even when insidious events aren't temporarily occurring, there's still a creepy sentiment behind it all. The aurora of the film is constantly a ghastly reminder that more sinister things are still yet to come. The story/plot is just incredibly spooky. When ghostly figures, inanimate objects, and precarious scenarios are consistently unfolding it takes every bit of willpower a person has to not look away from the screen. The Conjuring is an original, awesome, paralyzing horror movie with substance unseen in numerous other horror films."

","The Conjuring pulls its inspiration from a case file of famed demonologists and paranormal investigators the Warrens, the husband and wife team who's other journeys inspired films such as The Amityville Horror. Here they are played respectively by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga who are now both genre regulars with roles in Insidious and the upcoming Chapter 2 due this year for the gentleman and Orphan and television's Psycho prequel Bates Motel for Farmiga. We've all seen the painful trope of priests, exorcists, psychics and every nut-job in between showing up at the eleventh hour to save a haunted family but the way they're approached in The Conjuring stands as one of the film's greatest strengths. The movie sends chills in the spine. It is an epic masterpiece of direction and story. The Effects are ultimate and the story line is pretty interesting. The cast is brilliant .

You other reviewers need to listen to what Lorraine and Ed Warren says.....you don't play games with demons. If this disappointed anyone...then you are a non believer. To anyone that reads this before they watch this movie? I am telling ya.....if you didn't believe in God and the devil, you will after this. The Warrens and the Perrons made sure the director told their story accurately. There is no sex, and I heard Ron Livingston say God damn a couple of times, which to me is NOT what you want to say fighting demons or doing an exorcism. But, their story will scare the crap out of you. Today Ed and Lorraine are still involved with the paranormal. I think all the actors did a great job portraying the real people. So, you have been warned. Excuse me while I sit back and watch this movie again."
"theblackscythe","8","1","1","12 June 2014"," A look at James Wan and his modern horror masterpiece.
","James Wan is among the most influential horror directors in recent. His smash hit ""Saw"", a film which I am a large fan of, lead to the most successful horror franchise of the 2000's and the increasingly violent and disturbing nature of the films sequels caused the popularisation of the ""Torture porn"" subgenre. Wan has also reaped significant success with his recently popular ""Insidious"" series. So why is Wan successful and why do I like him so much?<br/><br/>Wan is a director who understands the secret to suspense, the unknown and the fear it creates. By keeping key details shrouded in shadow, and keeping the audience in the dark as to what's going to happen, Wan is able to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. This is helped also by Wan's talent for creating likable and identifiable characters, this makes the audience care all the more about what is going to happen next. This is used to great effect in ""The Conjuring"". Relatively large cast of characters are all surprisingly realistic and memorable, seeming real enough to warrant the audiences interest and sympathy. The nature of the supernatural elements are also kept largely in shadow for the majority of the film, keeping the audience constantly nervous and more susceptible to the films fantastically chilling atmosphere.<br/><br/>Wan also keeps his premises simple, but nuanced and detailed at the same time. ""The Conjuring"", at surface level, is a simple haunted house story. However the smaller details, such as the complex character relationships and strong character development, makes this concept feel fresh. <br/><br/>The film looks great too. The cinematography is great and takes full advantage of the tight environment and period setting to get some brilliant angles. The period of the 70's is perfectly brought to life through the soundtrack, costumes and colour palette, which immediately invokes films such as ""Amityville Horror"". Despite the isolated setting, the film dares to make use of other locations at times to add to the scale of the conflict and to keep latter parts of the film visually engaging. In particular the grounds surrounding the house are responsible for some truly memorable images and every moment spent there drips with mood and a chilling atmosphere.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in being very scary also, without having to resort to cheap jump scares. The film is brave and effective enough to simply allow the tension, atmosphere and characters to drive the scary moments, there is no artificiality here. <br/><br/>In conclusion, aside from ""Saw"" this stands as my favourite Wan film to date and my favourite horror film of the last few years. ""The Conjuring"" manages to feel classic and fully realised, whilst still being fresh and filled with personality. Wan is ahead of the game by a country mile."

It also thankfully doesn't fall into the annoying teen horror category. It features a group of characters you do start to care and feel for.<br/><br/>Final Verdict, I have to give credit to James Wan and everyone involved,They've created a movie with a very dark and edgy atmosphere and for a horror film to be able to earn its R-rated stripes on scares alone is certainly a show of great film making talent.

"candice-l-clark","9","1","1","27 May 2014"," An instant classic
","This is definitely one of the best horrors I've seen in ages. I loved the fact that it follows the classic horror movie formula, one which directors these days seem to be moving away from with all the 'torture porn' and 'found footage' films that have been so overdone lately, and it's a formula which genuinely works, hence why it's been followed so many times. The film felt like it was paying homage to older classics such as The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist etc. One of the best techniques used in the film has to the be the fact that you don't actually see anything scary for most of the film, it's just the threat of what it could be that scares the viewer – scary noises and doors opening by themselves seem to be enough to invoke absolute terror and suspense. The acting is top quality and captures the feel of the 70s really well. It felt like a really authentic account of events which supposedly took place in this house. The character development between the 2 couples in the film is really powerful and you really feel for all of them. There were some minor cheesy moments, but the rest of the film makes up for it and I didn't even mind them, in fact they added to the charm of the story and I felt like I was a kid again watching a horror movie for the first time. Such a treat for horror fans."

","While this film had some 'jump' moments (the basement scenes in particular), it was hard to be scared by the film as a whole.<br/><br/>As a typical Haunted House style film, it stands up well, especially against An American Haunting and others in the same genre, however its the kind of film where you know what's going to happen. Its the kind of film where you end up shouting at the screen ""turn around, you moron!"" and ""Why are you bothering to say 'is anyone there?'!? Its not like the ghost is going to pop up and say 'yeah, here I am, sorry for the inconvenience, I'll be on my way.'"" *cough* Enough of my ranting...<br/><br/>The start of the film may even be the scariest part, even though its not related as such to the main storyline.<br/><br/>The ambiguity of the ending is a welcome change from the 'lets hug and everything is fixed' style ending typical of American films (call me cynical, but I'm not a fan of happy (sappy) endings). The potential for a sequel is intriguing."
"starlimitz2","10","1","1","13 May 2014"," The Horror Genre has a new Come Back!
","My rating should give a good picture of how I felt about the movie as a whole. I must admit, I have not been that sincerely freaked out in a very, very long time. There was an absolutely amazing atmosphere throughout, and instead of the simple, childish jump-scares that we have been so accustomed to over the past decade. The characters are very likable, for the most part, and it even tends to work a bit of humor here and there to relieve the tension every once in a while. Then it draws you right back into a world of mystery and mischief. It would be bad to give away too much of the film. If you are looking for something to scare you inside and out, get this movie immediately, close out all of the light, and grab your teddy bear."

","This Wan directed installment, the cast, the score, limited amount of gore, very few profane references, and zero nudity has to the absolute greatest horror film I've ever seen. From the time the movie started until the last credit roll, I was literally on the edge of my seat grasping my wife's hand for sweet relief. The story unfolds nicely and the actors do a fantastic job of keeping you tuned in. I've watched many a horror flick and there is just something about this one that stands out far and beyond the rest. Congrats to the the film staff and for those of you wondering whether or not its worth a watch....I say you're missing out on a glorious fear roller coaster."
"emilyj96","9","1","1","2 May 2014"," one of the best films of 2013!
","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br/><br/>This movie is one of the best films of 2013 in the horror genre. It involves thriller, drama and an amazing storyline. Throughout the film we learn about all the different characters involved and feel apart of the main family. The actors in this film play their different parts perfectly, showing a variety of different emotions that help complete what is going on in that certain scene. The main character is Carolyn Perron played by Lili Taylor, she has the main storyline meaning she has the most things happening to her and she controls the part in top form, she changes from a loving mother to an evil demon within seconds taking on both parts extremely well. A main character is the ghost hunter Ed Warren who is played by Patrick Wilson who played the main character in Insidious which James Wan also directed, so for James it was an easy choice since he has worked with him already. Patrick is one of the best actors and takes on different roles really well, he is able to be a loving father, to a ghost hunter showing panic and concern throughout this movie. All the actors featured in this movie were the best choice for this feature film. This movie has 3 story lines, the first is from a previous encounter that the two main ghost hunters have, the second is learning about the ghost hunters and the second is learning about the main family who are effected by another encounter. This is a true story so it adds a more creepy feeling knowing the extreme events happened. The director, James Wan, uses the cinematography and mise en scene to set a terrifying mood which would make anybody jump! This 112 minute film will have you on a roller-coaster of emotions but you will not want to look away. Within the film it leaves you wondering what on earth could be happening, everything comes clear in the end, but you have to watch the whole thing to understand... It is definitely worth a watch, or two! A perfect horror film for all horror lovers."

","Brilliant. I would give this film a ten but it's not perfect. Then again, what film is? The 1970s film style shots, the variety of horror film features, the acting, the colours. Wan does a fantastic job and I honestly love and recommend this film to anyone who likes horror films. Whether you like hand filmed shots, gore, ghosts or emotion, this movie is for you. Some parts are creepy but fantastically creepy. James Wan is my favourite director and this has got to be his best work, better than Insidious Chapter 2. My only critic is a slight lack of colour variation to represent differing moods during scenes. I guess there is some brightness in the Warrens' house and at the hotel room but there could have just been more during happy scenes at the start of the film."
"peterp-450-298716","8","1","1","3 March 2014"," An outstanding creepy horror
","Sometimes it's better to keep the genie in the bottle.<br/><br/>After reading a lot about it and hearing the rave reviews, I finally sat in my cosy sofa to watch this, according to sources, extreme creepy horror and enjoy every second of it. I was very curious if this film would tickle my nerves and let a scary and eerie feeling descend all over me. Ultimately it wasn't so ...<br/><br/>Throw ""The Exorcist"", ""The Changeling"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""Paranormal Activity"" together, shake it well and finish it with masterly camera work, and you get this horror gem as a result. Only ""Drag me to hell"" also got my appreciation and I judged this one as being a decent horror film since they don't make them so well anymore recent years. Nowadays it's more teen-horror like Twilight and paranormal nonsense like Paranormal Activity and crappy footage horror.<br/><br/>Wan however has the talent to make a sizzling movie using the tension and an image-building that fascinates you and makes sure you keep on watching. It's again full of clichés and situations that are used countless times in other films. And yet it's all subtly intertwined and transcends the other horror crap that I have been presented with before.<br/><br/>So, an outstanding horror with a somewhat disappointing ending. It gave me a feeling as if it needed to be finished in a rush. Most films would still end up with an appearance in the music box. This movie is at that point masterfully,because here it doesn't happen.<br/><br/>The fact that this film is based on a true story (which I doubt) gives this film an extra dimension. <br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

","Finally got the chance to see the movie,I usually don't write reviews but this one made me do it. At First I think that's just a normal horror movie but as the film rolls forward it gets interesting and scarier you will not be disappointed in watching the film that's for sure. The film sets you on a roller coaster ride. In many horror films there are some scenes that makes it scarier but in this movies its also the story that makes it hard to watch.<br/><br/>The movie is based on real life events , Ed and Lorraine Warren are paranormal investigators set to help a family terrorized by a demon, said to be one of the most terrifying cases of their lives which they hadn't shared with anyone...until now.<br/><br/>There are some plot holes that yet to be answered but still it attracts you in watching it .<br/><br/>Finally In a nut shell it can be said that ""The Conjuring"" is a high class horror film that lived up to the hype."
"Tehmeh","9","1","1","19 December 2013"," Not quite what I hoped, but nevertheless a damn solid horror movie
","Just finished watching ""The Conjuring"", only now did I get the blu-ray.<br/><br/>Since I wasn't among the first people to see this in the theaters, my expectations were a little skewed. I was hearing and reading about this film being an instant classic and how terrifying this movie is. Naturally I let myself to expect the most horrifying (in a good way) thing anyone's ever put on screen. That wasn't the case, and I would advise to adjust any expectations accordingly. Looks like this film created a hype that became its own worst enemy. That said, I was still pretty tense the whole time, enjoyed the ride and not once did my attention or interest falter.<br/><br/>Think of ""The Conjuring"" as a mosaic. It has many elements of all the classic demonic/poltergeist/paranormal/witchcraft movies. It is not original at all, but it is so well made that it deserves some serious compliments. These are my compliments: <br/><br/><ul><li>The movie takes its time. The first hour is basically just setting up the last part of the movie. But it's never boring. Fans of more slow-paced storytelling will like the first hour and the way that the mood is built, and fans of ""crapload of stuff happening all at once"" can enjoy the hectic 3rd act. I think the film lost a little of its magic in the end, but you may think otherwise.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Absence of many annoying clichés. There really aren't that many jumpscares. And when they do happen, it's not the old ""camera turning with a person it follows while zooming into a scary face"" - trick. We don't get stupid characters doing stupid things or overly skeptic people that need to be constantly convinced that something out of this world is really happening. We don't get a forced twist to the mystery in the end, the whole mystery is pretty much clear a little over halfway into the movie. Also, the ending rewards the viewer. Wow, never thought that would happen.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Visuals and sound. The movie is set in 1970's, and it's a wonderful choice. The house, the clothes, the equipment, everything is as it should be so the setting itself is great. Add some nice camera work, good lighting, some freaky make-up and we're good to go. The overall ""style"" is just right and handled well. When you watch this movie, be sure to have the volume up. The sound department did a fantastic job, and I can't stress this enough: turn the volume up.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I did like the cast. Even Ron Livingston. But Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor and the ever beautiful Vera Farmiga get the biggest thumbs up. Surprisingly, the child actors didn't suck. Some of them were pretty good. They don't steal the show, but they manage well. From the older ""children"", Hayley McFarland again plays a younger person that she really is, but she fooled me.</li></ul><br/><br/>The characters add a nice contrast to each other. We have the troubled owners of the house and the couple investigating the phenomenon, which gives us a channel to change perspectives as viewers. Nothing in it seems out of place even though we've seen this before. I don't buy the ""based on true events"" - claim though. I won't laugh at people who do, but it had no effect on my experience or this review.<br/><br/>The script is tight enough, and James Wan's directing is worthy of a couple pats on the back. This movie doesn't treat you like an idiot, and it isn't cheap on what it does. This is pure old-school, both in horror and filmmaking department.<br/><br/>This movie has pretty much everything in it except gore, and it doesn't feel like a crammed-together mosaic even though that's probably what it is. I don't really know what to call this film myself, but I know that it works. It didn't shock me like no other movie, it didn't make me want to weep in the corner, but I was still captured the whole time. I guess I was just waiting for something phenomenally scary to happen and blow my mind, but in the end all I got was a ""very good, solid horror movie"". It felt like ""The Conjuring"" climbed effortlessly pretty high on a mountain, but never reached the top. I've seen tons of horror films and I recognize I might be desensitized at this point, but still that magical cherry on top of the cake was missing for me.<br/><br/>""Sinister"" and ""Insidious"" are some of my favorite modern horror movies, and ""The Conjuring"" is right up there with them. None of them are perfect nor terrifying beyond belief, but I would recommend them all to fans of possession/haunted house genre. ""The Conjuring"" is probably the most down-to-earth horror film of them all, and thus easier to accept. Even if I didn't get the magical masterpiece I was hoping for, I got a really good one. <br/><br/>I have a habit of being easy on horror movies I like, so if you're not exactly a fan of the genre, feel free to take a couple points off."

"moviewizguy","8","5","12","17 July 2013"," James Wan Takes Things Old School
","""The Conjuring"" is a film that knows it's scary. Right from the start, the orchestra plays violently in the background while the ominous logos of WB and New Line appear on screen, much like the opening of ""Insidious."" So are the filmmakers cocky or confident? With a film this well made, does it even matter? One thing I know for sure is this: ""The Conjuring"" is one of the most impressive horror films I've seen in awhile.<br/><br/>With his directorial debut of ""Saw"" back in 2004, James Wan has since improved as a filmmaker, although faltering from ""Dead Silence"" and ""Death Sentence."" ""Insidious"" was a noticeable improvement, but darn the second half of that film. Now, with ""The Conjuring,"" it seems like Wan has found his sweet spot, even though it does embark on familiar territory with ""Insidious"" and other horror films made in the past like ""The Exorcist"" and ""The Amityville Horror."" The similarities the film shares with ""Insidious"" is particularly apparent and slightly disappointing, from certain plot points and even down to some of its characters. However, unlike ""Insidious,"" the film actually does get better in the second half. ""The Conjuring"" is also the most recent horror film in memory that puts a lot of attention to its characters. The film takes much effort to make the characters feel like people, not expendable pieces of meat to higher the body count.<br/><br/>For example, there are five daughters in this film, each with their different personalities, and you will be able to tell the difference between every one of them. By doing so, you truly care for the characters when they're in danger. It also helps that you have talented actors to play these roles, especially the female leads, Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor. Farmiga plays a character who is empathetic with an emotionally wounded past, but that plot point is so understated that it brings a sort of dignity to her role. Taylor is equally as impressive, if not more so than Farmiga, as the motherly figure. In one very effective scene, she may bring a tear to your eye.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" doesn't set out to do anything groundbreaking, but the familiar tricks it does, it does really well. While nothing new, what sets the film apart from most other horror films is the restraint. ""Less is more"" is the motto here, and some of the film's best scares are those where you see nothing. The way the story plays out is also very unexpected, with a structure that probably hasn't been done in other horror films before due to the ensemble cast (there are 11 people in the house at one point). It was a risky move to have such a large cast, but it worked out wonderfully. However, to play ""The Conjuring"" up as the ""scariest movie ever"" is silly and does the film injustice. Is the film scary? What's ""scary"" is subjective. I personally wouldn't get nightmares over it, but there are some great scares in here. Regardless, horror films rarely come as good and beautifully crafted as ""The Conjuring,"" which is why it should be seen."

","So after reading the reviews on IMDb I couldn't wait to see a horror movie that could actually scare me like the movies made in 2008 and 2009. I had very high expectations and I was desperately staring at the screen begging for something to send chills down my spine. Hell, I even watched it ""in an atmospheric environment"" because I felt this was the kind of movie that deserved to be watched in a special manner so as to increase its ""effectiveness"": I got the Full HD version, closed the doors, darkened the room, , and sat really close to the widescreen TV. I can't even begin to explain how disappointed I was when the movie finally finished. I even refused to look at the clock just so I couldn't figure when the movie was going to end. After everything was done, I stared at the screen waiting to see ""at least"" some kind of surprise ending, but alas, even ""that"" was lacking, and then the credits started to roll.<br/><br/>I don't understand what made all these reviewers call this movie"" the scariest movie in decades"". Perhaps these reviews come from people who are new to the horror genre? Yeah, that's probably the case. I'm sorry, but even the jump scares in this movie had not been executed properly. For a jump scare to work you've got to have the right camera angle and more importantly execute it at the time when viewers would least expect it. I almost began to regain hope when I heard some really loud crash in the house, but that's about all I got in the entire movie, and no, it's not going to save this movie from ""not being scary one bit"". The acting was surprisingly good, but when I watch a horror movie I'm not after Oscar-worthy performances. I'm after getting scared, petrified and to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.<br/><br/>To the director: You want to make good horror movies? Watch ""Drag Me to Hell"" and learn how to make one."

","Add one part amityville horror (any version or sequel will do) blend in the exorcist, this can be substituted with any exorcism related movies that have been released, add a dash of poltergeist and a very ample helping of lame crap and you have amityexorgeist....or as its also known the conjuring. I went in to this movie as a horror movie lover...umm I mean a good horror movie lover...knowing very little about it. I have heard that it is supposed to be very scary and with filmmakers who have worked with great films such as saw and insidious I had somewhat high hopes for a good creepy thriller. Boy I was disappointed. I will give credit to the scenery which helped the spooky atmosphere however it just wasn't much. There seemed to be a loooooooooot of blah blah blah between the characters to the point I was nodding off. When I see a scary movie I like for it to be scary and this just wasn't. It had a few moments to make you jump, or at least that was the intention. The fact is its a story that has been told and retold and revisited in sequels and remade so it just gets worn out. My main frustration is that I paid theater tickets to see something barely worth my time watching for free on Netflix. I will say this movie would be ideal for kids who want to see a scary movie with their parents or perhaps a horror fan who has a heart condition and can only handle mild scares. But if you want a real creepy freaky scary horror movie this will probably disappoint. And I do not base that on the lack of blood gore sex alcohol drugs and profanity, in fact I do applaud a movie that can still put out a good story without having to succumb to those often senseless tactics. Though if you want to see any of the aforementioned then once again skip this one. Twice I left the movie for a cigarette in hopes that when I returned something intriguing would be taking place on screen which is something I've never done."

","For releasing this derivative nonsense on the heels of a really good horror movie like Insidious. I had strong reservations about this one after watching the trailer and seeing the full movie only confirmed my worst fears. The movie is a tired mix of the 1982 cheapo horror classic Superstition (a witch returns to take vengeance on the descendants of her persecutors) and The Amityville Horror.<br/><br/>Wan should have steered clear of such obvious nutcases as the Warrens and relied on original material by real writers. The film isn't even internally consistent. At one moment the Warrens are learnedly lecturing classes on the three stages of demonic visitation, the last stage being possession. Then they get this case of a witch who killed her child and possesses other mothers to kill their kids. And what do they do? Do they, knowing the third stage to be imminent, keep careful watch on the mother? Of course they don't.<br/><br/>Terrible movie. I really hope Wan hasn't lost his touch, I was looking forward to Insidious 2."
"wadechurton","3","4","9","4 August 2013"," All conjuring tricks, but no real magic.
","As a kid I used to like staying up late to watch those old early-70s TV horror movies like 'The House That Would Not Die' (1970), 'Crawlspace' (1972), 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark' and 'The Night Stalker' (both 1973), 'Trilogy of Terror' (1976; the one with the wee doll chasing Karen Black around) and so on, and 'The Conjuring' (2013) is basically another one of those (it's even set in 1971). Oh, it has a few bells and whistles (like CGI effects and some slick bigger-budget moves) but it's basically cut from the same cloth as some of the more mediocre ones I'd have seen back then (actually, those last three TV movies named are pretty good, and they're up on YouTube too). 'The Conjuring' has a large family moving into a big old haunted house (it's a cool-looking house, BTW) wherein they experience untoward goings-on and soon realise that it's haunted by the spirit of a nasty old witch. Complications follow, and so do a whole bunch of clichés and non-scariness. What's more is that the movie has an annoyingly conservative tone; for instance there is a distinctly pro-Christian stance to the story, to the point that when the evil entity is being vanquished a 'heavenly choir' soundtrack breaks out. I guess that's what happens when the mainstream finally takes notice of independent stuff; they scoop it up, dumb it down and sell it to the masses like it's something new. Ah well, that's the way the cookies crumble."
"thefallsatnewyork","6","4","9","1 August 2013"," Some Great Scares. Almost Got it Right.
","This film is essentially The Exorcist meets Amityville Horror.<br/><br/>My two major complaints with the movie: 1) Poor pacing that gave a roller-coaster effect, with long drawn out boredom accompanied by jump-out-of-your-seat shots that lasted a mere seconds, 2) The unfortunate and too many typical and routine scenes that made this just another scary movie.<br/><br/>My friend and I both got five or so great jumps from the scare shots. But where Director Woo finally got close to seriously and deeply scaring me was with the exorcism that takes place in the basement towards the end. The jump scenes were great, but The Conjurer is the one 'scary movie' that finally comes close to matching The Exorcist in terms of being evil. Almost got there, but - UGH.... Woo let the moment and potential slip away. What could have been true horror turned out to be just some really excellent scary spots.<br/><br/>Since I found The Exorcist to be the most horrific and honest ""horror"" movie I have seen in my 45 years watching movies, I rate all others from that. To me, The Exorcist is so evil, I won't watch it alone. I tried once, about seven years ago, and it scared me so bad, I had to stop and put on a Disney movie to un-scare me (seriously.) The acting here was by and large fantastic, except the young actress playing the youngest of the daughters, who delivered her lines poorly... she sadly couldn't pull off the roll. Once again, for a horror film, I've come to expect uneventful or poor acting, but the cast did a fine job here for a change.<br/><br/>The Conjurer was pretty darn scary at points, generally well-done, and was worth the cost of seeing at the theater. Would I see it again? No. Would I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of scary flicks? Oh yeah! I'm just disappointed that Woo put the breaks on right when he was developing what could have been a Horror Classic to match that of The Exorcist. Dang! So Close!"

Insidious totally scared the hell out of me. The jump scares on The Conjuring is so predictable that you already know someones coming out to scare you, an example is the ghost that jump at the top of the Closet and goes on top of the girl. It's not like insidious where the ghost were unpredictable and you don't know when and where they will pop up. I also found The Conjuring too slow paced, I felt like the first half is they are trying to build up the tension but loses steam after. I also didn't like that they add some hidden laughs, I don't really want to spoil anything, but in some parts, most of the people in the theater are laughing and it kinda detracts the tension and the fact that it's supposed to be a horror movie not some kind of Horror-Comedy like the horrendous ""Cabin in The Woods"" movie. The performance of Wilson and Farmiga is good IMO, though I think Wilson did a better job in Insidious.<br/><br/>Overall I'll give this movie 4/10 for the effort of the actors/actresses.

For instance, they moved in the second week of Jan during a hellacious snow storm, they even met the last resident in the house before they move in; Mr. K. The clocks would stop at 5.15 am not 3.07 am. The daughters were well respected little ladies and minded their manners; in this movie based in the 70s you can tell the girls are from our modern age with their sassy talk and ""oh this house is such a piece of crap I want to let my parents know with the brattiest attitude that I hate it here"".<br/><br/>the doll had really no purpose being in this film since it wasn't about the Perron case.

I saw The Conjuring today after all the waiting and reading of accolades from trusted critics, friends and strangers with seemingly otherwise good taste, articulation and history of horror film viewership. The only bad reviews I'd seen so far sounded like they came from 15-year-olds who probably expected another 'Saw.' I tried to avoid too many spoilers so that all I knew beforehand was that the movie's 'R' rating was apparently based purely on its scariness, since it had no nudity or cursing and virtually no direct violence or gore. This sounded right up my alley, since that describes a lot of the creepiest movie experiences I've had. I had also heard it compared to Amityville Horror and The Exorcist a lot, but always with the caveat that it had plenty of originality and stand-alone storyline and scares. <br/><br/>I came out of the theater wondering if I saw the same movie everyone was raving about, or this was some kind of dream or prank. This was the un-scariest movie I have already seen 8 or 9 times in my whole life. <br/><br/>My spoiler-free review in a nutshell is: If you are considering seeing this movie, haven't already seen a lot of ghost/demon movies and have an appreciation for God/Satan-centered horror, you might like it. By the way, it isn't my atheist-leaning agnosticism that makes the style offensive to me; it's the total unoriginality and uncreativity of it. I'd much more highly recommend others of the 70's era in the ghost genre with totally original concepts that don't lean on religion, such as The Changeling, or my favorite movie of all time, The Shining. In fact I would probably rather rewatch any of a number of not-bad ghost films I've already seen at least twice, like The Others or The 6th Sense, before I'd give up 113 minutes watching The Conjuring again. It's that tedious to me. <br/><br/>The comparison to Amityville and Exorcist is more than apt; it's truly a head/tail hybrid of those two movies (in that order), where what starts out as a haunted house movie turns in to a demon possession one. The house turns out to have a lot of history of course, garden variety murders and suicides, but the main evil stems from the spirit a woman who, get this, was an accused Salem witch (cheap) and get THIS, really was a Satan worshipper....woooOOO! So of course it takes the Christian incantations of a demon-fightin' power couple and the love of the family in the center of the story to overcome the demon that has possessed the mother, in a scene embarrassingly reminiscent of the Carol Anne rescue scenes in Poltergeist 1 and 2 (and of course Exorcist). Actually 99% of the scare devices used in this movie were things we've all seen in a bunch of other movies. I saw it in a theater that was not Imax/RPX but with a very big screen and lots of loud speakers. All the loud noises and music in the last 20 minutes only made me wish it was over sooner, since by then I had already stopped hoping for anything interesting to happen. The acting and cinematography were fine but not nearly enough to make for a great horror film."
"Now-Hear-Me-Out","4","4","9","21 July 2013"," It Was Over Hyped - Tell Me I'm Wrong
","I'm feeling as though I'm in a rather small majority on this one. The Conjuring was the horror film equivalent to Prometheus: concerning all of its high expectations. To put it simply, horror films are all about the set up and the release (or the ""pay-off""), and I felt neither. In my opinion, having felt the lack of the release was due in part to the weak or unclear set up. I don't consider myself a writer, although I believe I could be capable of writing a screenplay that could get away with murder.<br/><br/>Speaking of murder, how many deaths occurred in the span of this film? Well, there are certainly various instances of implied murders, but other than that we only see the family's dog and a scene that contains flocks upon flocks of birds that fall (or fly rather) to their death. All of the slaying surrounding any humans had taken occurrence in the past in regard to the history leading up to the family's arrival. Whether a story is illustrated through a movie, a play, or a book (or any other medium), death is to be used as a plot device: a means to give a strong punctuation to the overall storyline. So what is death? Death is the looming threat that will eventually get the better of us, if we're ready for it or if we're not. The element of death can be represented symbolically as a warning, as significance, or the consequence of there being one. <br/><br/>If there isn't a single main character that doesn't die in a HORROR film amid the first and second act (even up to the third act), then the film instinctively looses its power, and one's attentiveness along with it. At the conclusion of the film, one might ask, ""So, what did we gain from this?"" Well, we relearned that at the end of any successful exorcism, the film would automatically instill a peaceful and a settling mood to the environment. That type of mood is over portrayed in the conclusion, and doesn't benefit the film at all; it felt forced. We also learned that ""jump scares"" are still being used as a gimmick these days (yes, there are ""jump scares"" in this) only to lift audience's eyelids of slumber. And lastly, if there are occurrences of paranormal activity at any time shown in a horror film, it better had be at night (or in this case, at 3:07 am precisely). <br/><br/>Which now brings myself to the time to talk about the aspects of the film that I did enjoy, and thought that the film did justice to. The characters in the film are likable enough to care for (to an extent) the cinematography is some of the best work I've seen in most recent years, the first shot and the last shot felt like the two highest points of visual stimulation, the score for the film was nice and booming (although in scene of the exorcism, the film decides to splice it along side with a character searching for someone in another section of the house, which lacks the tension in the score when it shifts back to him). There were a couple of Amityville Horror references that provided some sparks. And the exorcism scene itself was creative and inventive with the environment of which it was set. <br/><br/>However, the film did not deliver any emotional connection between my associates and I. We found ourselves pointing out (and chuckling about) where the next big scare would be, and we weren't all that far off for the majority of them. There was only one time that the film caught me off guard. It dealt with the character Lorraine Warren, who was standing outside by the lake (or river) when her husband comes from behind her when, she spots a corpse hanging from the tree behind him, which gave the film some points. The reason the sequence worked as well as it did was due to the time it occurred: MIDDAY. Which is perfect in any horror film to strive for, because it will not be anticipated. <br/><br/>I went into this film the same way I go into any film these days, which is to go into it without any knowledge of the plot, characters or anything. It is simply the trailers these days that can give away crucial large chucks of the film; thus I avoid them at all costs (though I wouldn't have felt any more letdown than if I had). A lessor film would have added a cheap jump scare to the ending shot; this one does not, which it earns some more points for that as well.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought there were various elements of the film that were rather rewarding to its plot. Though the film as a whole, felt somewhat lousy in its execution. Now there are some critics out there that are calling it something like ""This generation's The Exorcist!"" It's a statement that sounds a bit hefty for a film that might not age as well as the classic. In the end, if one were to compare the two, they will find a clear and strong difference between the two films: AUTHENTIC HORROR. Can you guess which one?"

","It's been a long time since I've had so much fun at a horror film. The emphasis on tension and downplaying of gore pays off in a big way here. From the director of SAW, that may seem a bit surprising, but it really isn't a 'disgusting' film. My friend actually hurt her elbow while watching it -- from flailing around in her seat. I just kept cackling at how well the frights were being set up. And when was the last time real, good actors appeared in a horror film? Vera Farmiga is dynamite. What a delight. Grab some friends (who don't mind being grabbed constantly) and belly up to this flick for a great time at the movies. Prices being what they are, I almost always regret spending the bucks on going to the theater these days -- not so here. Totally worth it. Run to the theater -- bet you'll be running out of it as well!"

","Cinema has gotten worst year after year, decades after decades. We now live in a time where all films are pretty much on the same level: terrible and replicas of movies done before.<br/><br/>Someone insisted I watch The Conjuring with them, telling me how good it was. <br/><br/>The #1 issue is the incompetence of James Wan. Whoever he is, it is obvious he is unable to create a story in visual terms. The camera is CONSISTENTLY in the wrong spot or moving for no valid reason. If a character is looking under a bad or up a flight of stairs, to film this character FROM that place tells us there's nothing to be afraid of there since the camera is standing in that very same place. This ultra basic psychological technique which has been adhered to since Hitchcock is broken pretty much every chance this inept director gets.<br/><br/>There is no suspense or genuine scare. You jump from loud noise, cliché moving doll crap and the annoying camera-work keeps getting in the way of the mood they are trying to achieve. Pitiful."

I couldn't help but have major objections to everything in this movie, from its stupid premise to the gradual introduction of its asinine characters, but especially its lame attempt, endless attempts, to be scary. And by God, I would have been scared, too, if I had even a minimal belief and interest in the story and the characters. As it was, I was simply tired of such obvious manipulation, and felt a genuine relief when the credits finally rolled.<br/><br/>Sjw"
"sid_vampire","3","3","6","30 July 2014"," If you're looking for a scare, give this film a miss...
","Maybe I've just been desensitised through years of watching horror movies but I didn't find this film scary in the slightest, lets just say for a horror film it wasn't particularly horrific. I was also one of those that fell prey to the hundreds of positive reviews and the high IMDb rating, if this movie taught me anything its that perhaps I shouldn't listen to IMDb ratings in future.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film I felt like this was going to be a great movie and have me on my edge on seat for the duration, the basis for a great story was there it just fell short of my expectations and by the end of the film I was left disappointed and dumbfounded. At first I couldn't understand why I disliked this film so much, but then I realised this film had absolutely no story to it whatsoever. This film seemed to get off on cheap thrills and scares and all of the bits that made you jump were put where you'd expect them to be rather than where you'd least expect them to be, and then when you actually see the malevolent entity in question it in no way lives up to your expectations.<br/><br/>My main qualm with this movie was the fact that this film seemed to jump from story to story. I wasn't counting but there were at least 3 different stories embedded into the main story and each time a new story arose I waited patiently for there to be some sort of conclusion or explanation only to be left waiting. It even angered me slightly the fact that the whole movie was based around this one family and house being haunted and to then not even explain 1) why the family and house were haunted in the first place and 2) who these malevolent entities even were. At one point we see a ghostly girl being hung from a tree and we all expect that to be explained but it never is, we're just supposed to accept the fact that this family and house are haunted and deal with it, as are the family, I think if I was in that sort of situation I'd want some sort of explanation. The paranormal ""investigators"" didn't seem to do much investigating.<br/><br/>To me, this film is trying to be Insidious and failing miserably. It seems as if James Wan has realised he cant get by on sequels forever so tried to do something different but his something different turned out to be exactly the same as his last movie. I like James Wan's films so I expected a lot from this however my expectations were abruptly dashed and I was left feeling unsatisfied and in need of a horror movie that lived up to its genre. I just hope for better from him in the upcoming Insidious sequel and maybe some explanations in the upcoming The Conjuring spin-off."
"Buddy-51","5","3","6","26 November 2013"," Nothing new here
","The main problem with a movie like ""The Conjuring"" is that it assumes that none of us have ever been to a haunted house movie before (perhaps not an entirely unwarranted assumption given that the characters in these movies clearly never have or they'd know better than to move into one of these houses in the first place).<br/><br/>You know the drill. Unsuspecting family from the city buys an old place in the country. Weird things begin to happen. Ghostbusters are brought in to investigate. Turns out some restless spirits, the victims of various ghastly crimes in the past, are roaming around the place searching for someone to free them from their predicament so they can move on and find eternal peace. Supernatural pandemonium ensues. Roll credits. The End.<br/><br/>This one is set in 1971 (the girls are watching ""Brady Bunch"" reruns in the middle of the afternoon long before the show ever went into syndication, but then I doubt that facts are high on the agenda for these filmmakers). Lily Taylor and Ron Livingston play the parents of five daughters who become bedeviled by some evil forces lurking in the dark recesses of the creaky old fixer-upper they've purchased in rural Rhode Island. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are the world-famous paranormal researchers, the Warrens, who attempt to exorcise the demons from the place.<br/><br/>The kind of movie for which a spoiler alert is practically superfluous, ""The Conjuring"" is allegedly based on a true story, a come-on that might have been more convincing had the movie not seemed so much like every other haunted house movie we've ever seen. I'd like to believe that even ghosts can't be this boringly predictable.<br/><br/>Maybe someday someone somewhere will come up with something new that will breathe some much-needed life into the genre. Till then, I guess, movies like ""The Conjuring"" - and there will be many more to come, I'm sure - will just have to do."
"jcromwell66762","4","3","6","26 November 2013"," Seriously?
","No spoiler, but I have seen scarier episodes of ""Scooby Doo"". The story line was acceptable but, seriously, unless you need sleep you're wasting your time. They over hyped this movie terribly, the only truly scary sight is the cameo appearance by the actual Lorraine Warren during the second college lecture. If this is truly from their case files, I seriously doubt that there is much fact put into the movie.<br/><br/>It is mildly entertaining, and some of the effects are decent, but the whole hype (and not just from the media, as I have multiple friends who saw this before I did and claimed it was the scariest movie they ever saw) was just totally overblown."

","Several of my friends had recommended this title to me so, being an aficionado of horror movies, I sprung for the HD pay-per-view and now wish I had waited for Netflix instead because at least my disappointment would have been less costly. For openers, there's a scene involving a couple of young women roommates from 1968 who have this hideous doll in their apartment which has apparently been inhabited by a demon...that they invited. What this has to do with the rest of the film is somewhat vague,nor does it even seem a reasonable premise,however the real question is why would 2 otherwise seeming normal young women obtain this grotesquely disfigured toy and then apparently invite a deceased person to inhabit it .... it""s a small part of the film but nonetheless indicative of the annoying overall slapdash effort involved in the entire movie. The film references such classics as ""The Exorcist"", ""The Birds"", ""The Amityville Horror"" and a classic Twilight Zone episode, yet only suffers from these allusions by comparison. The story allegedly takes place in 1971 however the set design is fairly unconvincing in that regard. I remember 1971 vividly and it was a time of bright colors as opposed to the faded, muted palette employed here. Yeah, I understand that this effect was intended in all likelihood for some sort of perceived horror ambiance although it seems that it would have been more effective to transition from bright hues initially to a more burned out darker setting as the saga allegedly descends into horror-mode. Cheesy carnival B-movie spook house effects pervade this production, but again lacking the kitschy charm frequently displayed in the aforementioned venues. The characters are little more than sketches of real people who ultimately only come off as pawns in a Satan vs. God chess game. The Conjuring is deeply unsatisfying and the scariest part is that I dropped $5.99 for HD pay-per-view on this turkey."

Loud or soft noises, stuff lifting into the air and moving around, scary faces and the like.<br/><br/>In the end, the movie seemed rather ridiculous rather than frightening. <br/><br/>That being said, the Warrens are and always have been two of the most annoying ghost hunters in the world.

","Best thing about the movie was that i watched it on my laptop because, I am trying to reason with myself why would i pay bucks to bug my ear with screaming kids and loud wives which aren't even in bed yet. and the demonologist would just keep her hand on the head of the possessed to control it and save people which could have been dead in the 1st hr of the movie. I wonder why didn't Keanu Reeves (constantine) tried this simple approach rather than going through the trouble of sitting on the tied up possessed to calm it down.<br/><br/>its a easy 5/10 whereby the acting is nice, the script is decently delivered but the only thing really scary about the movie are the screams which pop out of no where and sudden moments where i could think are pretty close to the movie Exorcist. But here, it is easy to puke out the ghost rather than going through long scenes which took an added 30 Min's. I would have loved this movie if it was a fast paced one ending in about an hr. <br/><br/>To reason why the screams are there, you are bound to see 4-5 kids in a big haunted lonely house where someone would want to take his family. and the poor dog again had to die in the movie to prove a ghost playing with a doll (Miss me?) (""Really!!! a true story????"") <br/><br/>if it makes you feel any better i couldn't yawn throughout the movie. it was just too shrill to dose off. There were times when i thought my speakers are damaged but i ended up realizing that its the brain which got damaged instead that i downloaded such movie.<br/><br/>I cant suggest this movie to anyone as it is better to go through the older movies again rather than falling for these new horror movies which are based on true stories all the time and the plot is never changing."
"adriangr","7","3","6","19 August 2013"," Disappointing
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie after the amazing ""Insidious"" got under my skin so well. I am sad to report that I did not find ""The Conjuring"" anywhere near as good. It didn't help that in the UK, so many critics gave rave reviews, telling how frightened they were. So I was really geared up for a good scary experience. But, if you've seen a few haunted house movies in the last decade, you won't be frightened by this.<br/><br/>I guess I should say that this review contains plot spoilers...<br/><br/>Things open well with a huge close up of the very nasty looking ""Annabelle Doll"" which I assumed was going to play a big role in what was about to unfold on screen. Sad to say that, although the 10 minute prologue used the doll with a certain degree of effectiveness, once the real story started it was all but abandoned for the remainder of the movie. What we had instead was your basic common or garden possessed house with the family undergoing all the trappings of a traditional movie haunting - being touched by unseen hands, being lured out of bed at night by strange noises, finding blocked up rooms galore, seeing sudden shock faces and figures looming out of dark corners at them, etc etc. This has all been done before, including some very similar creepy face make-up on the ghosts looking just like the ghoulish apparitions in ""Insidious"", and a rather unsuccessful attempt at turning a children's game of hide & clap into a scare was too similar to a similar game used to similar effect in ""The Orphanage"" from a few years back.<br/><br/>It's either me, or the techniques used here are not working any more. There were very very few true surprise scares in the film. And the scares there were seemed like re-runs of things that have been done before. What ""Insidious"" did so well was to show you things just long enough and just indistinctly enough to make you notice that something was wrong...in ""The Conjuring"", they didn't do this as well. Yes, suddenly seeing an ugly witch on top of a wardrobe is scary - but seeing the witch then jump on top of the unfortunate victim leading to an invisible wrestling match is not. Like in ""The Haunting"" (which this film has been likened to, due to some banging on doors by unseen forces), the scariest things are those that don't make themselves too obvious. The creepiest part of Insidious was when Rose Burn was hanging out her washing and thought she saw a little midget dancing about in the living room...""The Conjuring"" blows this ambiguity by blasting you with big close ups of cackling faces far too often.<br/><br/>What I did like was the acting, the cast are all very good, especially Vera Farmiga as the medium. And like ""Insidious"" the film is far better during the first half when you don't know what's going on. It suffers - like ""Insidious again"" - from a finale which is all crash, bang and wallop and you have found out what force the family are fighting - it's better and scarier when you don't know. <br/><br/>So I am sorry to say the scares did not work for me this time. More of the Annabelle Doll would have spiced this up nicely - that thing was creepy as hell, but it was hardly ever on screen in the film at all. Disappointed all round."
"ajmudhoney","2","3","6","4 August 2013"," Typical, predictable and not scary in any way
","I honestly don't understand the high ratings this movie is receiving as, like I said in the subject line, it was completely predictable and clichéd. There was not one thing in this film we haven't seen a hundred times before i.e. creaking doors and the ever so overused cheap jump in front of the screen by an actor in ""scary"" makeup meant to startle you. The only good things I can say about this movie are the quality actors in it, and they all did a good job here although I do question their choices to be in such rubbish to begin with. The result for me being I can no longer trust that a movie will be good because they are in it, or based on a rating on IMDb."

","I really enjoyed the movie, but I was not frightened one bit. I enjoyed some of the tense moments and the unexpected ""entities"" that popped in and out, but the movie itself was not scary. It appears that Hollywood can no longer produce a truly horrifying movie since the Exorcist. But compared to the swill that is being passed off as horror, the Conjuring is pretty darn good. I just want to point out something that really pisses me off when it comes to horror movies. First, why does every demon possession movie have to get the Catholic Church's permission in order to address a demon?? What about a Methodist church or a Jehovah Witness temple?? Do demons only respond to a Catholic priest or to a crucifix?? And why does everyone assume that all demons can understand or speak Latin?? What about demons that may be affiliated with a Buddhist temple or a Hindu shrine?? What language would be spoken to them?? Second, why do people believe that witches worship Satan?? Witches practice a religion that worship nature, not Satan. It appears that whenever a movie mentions ""witch"", they pull out Satanism, evil spells, hexes, and possession. Witches adhere to the ""Do No Harm"" mantra. The movie itself was enjoyable, but it would be refreshing to have a horror movie that does not base its premise on a fallacious religion that not everyone follows. More and more people are turning away from Christianity and maybe Hollywood should too."

When Sinister came out i thought OK now we're getting somewhere. OK, Sinister is flawed in places but my favourite part of this movie was the unnerving soundtrack. Throw in some cheap frights and it was easily the best horror/thriller of 2012. The Conjuring has none of these aspects. What it does have is unlikeable, clichéd characters, clichéd script and some really bad acting by everyone involved and not to mention an uninspired score and crappy dialogue.Throw all that in and you have one of the worst movies of the year. Looking at other reviews, i say don't believe the hype. If you never see this movie you will not have missed out on anything.

","1. There's more clapping in this movie than at a Sunday Baptist church service. Hell, the clap-on/clap-off lady didn't do this much clapping.<br/><br/>2. Any paranormal story disclaimer of ""Based on the true story"" should be accompanied with ""well, if you believe in this sort of thing."" <br/><br/>3. To be fair, maybe the ""true"" part was that the Demonbuster Duo believes their own fairytale and did publish it. Sounds like another demonic duo that dreamt up a religion in the mid-1800s and also published it.<br/><br/>4. For being thee most ""malevolent"" case of the Demonbusters' 1000+ entries, does this mean the inevitable sequel is guaranteed to be less ""malevolent?"" Will this ""truthful"" disclaimer be on the poster?<br/><br/>5. ""So far, it hasn't done anything violent, and that's a good sign,"" says Demonbuster Ed. The family must've only had that recently slaughtered family dog they loved so much for only a day in order for them to forget about her so quickly.<br/><br/>6. The debate, or inconsistencies within the story, of whether this is a ghost, demon, witchy-woman or Shadow Person, raged on with the contradictions in the script. Suffice to say, don't listen to anything the characters tell you and just know: it's a very bad thing.<br/><br/>7. Ghosts – or demons? - who have been dead for a long time start to stink badly. Which makes sense if they rotted, but do ""ghosts"" really decay? <br/><br/>8. I know it's 1971, but has anyone really ever cleaned with elbow grease? <br/><br/>9. If I softly close a kitchen cabinet, it wakes my roommate up. And yet, half a dozen picture frames fall hard against the staircase and the sound of shattering glass echoing throughout this house doesn't wake the five timid girls.<br/><br/>10. Nor does the mother stepping on the glass loudly.<br/><br/>11. Nor does the mother falling down the stairs.<br/><br/>12. Nor does the mother screaming.<br/><br/>13. Heck, screw this family. She should be the first to leave and alone. Especially when her girls don't hear her from within the house and the returning father hears one of the girls screaming inside from the outside, on the street, 200+ feet away and around a semi.<br/><br/>14. Don't fall for the ""it's getting late"" excuse from your Demonbuster Duo for hire. Remind them that there's at least five more hours of daylight left.<br/><br/>15. As with most of these fictional tales, entities can teleport beyond walls. However, children and dolls still shouldn't be able to. Making this up as you go, eh? <br/><br/>16. Even though it seems like our Demonbuster heroine drops six floors in a two-story home, it shouldn't take five minutes to get to the basement to rescue her. Well, if you don't waste all that time pounding on the walls verses just going to the basement, that is.<br/><br/>17. You will only be reminded it's 1971 becauseone character says ""groovy"" and The Brady Bunch is on TV.<br/><br/>18. Oh, and in the seventies, only the rich could afford flashlights. The rest had to settle withmatches.<br/><br/>19. Demonbuster Lorraine's mother questions her daughter's suspicion that her child might not be alright. Has this mother been in the dark this whole time to what her daughter does for a living? Or even her ""special gift?"" Have the mother and daughter met? <br/><br/>20. Fear not! This apparently blind demon, who can pass through walls, knock things over, pull sleeping children out of sleep, lead kids astray, possess people, reveal itself when the plot requires it to and turn the Narnia Wardrobe into a nasty place, actually needs to be told where her target victim is hiding. In her own home.<br/><br/>21. One of the daughters is dragged across the room by her hair, is saved by scissors and yeteveryone retreats to their rooms to have a good night sleep before finally deciding to leave the property in the morning, several hours later? <br/><br/>22. It was nice to see Chucky's Seed return to theatres.<br/><br/>23. Suggestion #1: So they ""can't move out because they'll follow you?"" Huh.

","The tired old supernatural genre. Well, I have to be honest, I am not usually impressed by many of these. I did like white noise and a few others though. Sleepy hollow too. When a movie is more soundly based in the supernatural, I can enjoy it.<br/><br/>But from the opening credits, I was internally rolling my eyes. It is heavily religious, and based in that world view. Which is another reason for the eye rolling. And in that confused Christian way. <br/><br/>I couldn't finish watching it, I found it utterly silly. If you find demons laughable, or know what witchcraft or the occult actually is, or are just are not of the Christian persuasion, I suggest that you don't watch this movie. There are more effective scares for such people in other movies. If on the other hand, your world view is heavily colored by the church, this might just be your cup of tea."

","In 1971, Carolyn and Roger Parren move their family into a dilapidated Rhode Island farm house and soon strange things start happening around it with escalating nightmarish terror. In desperation, Carolyn contacts the noted paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, to examine the house. What the Warrens discover is a whole area steeped in a satanic haunting that is now targeting the Parren family wherever they go. To stop this evil, the Warrens will have to call upon all their skills and spiritual strength to defeat this spectral menace at its source that threatens to destroy everyone involved.<br/><br/>James Wan gets out of his 'creepy doll' playhouse (sorta) and successfully tries his hand at hauntings. The Conjuring doesn't even remotely reinvent the genre, nor does it earn the title of 'the best horror movie ever/of the decade', but based on the hype and incredible positive word of mouth its riding on, one would think it does.<br/><br/>Pros: Wan simply succeeds by putting the story before everything else. The cast is filled with good, recognizable actors (whom I very much like). The acting, cinematography and score, especially the sound mixing, is top notch. It didn't feel like there were any unnecessary jump scares and I was totally immersed in the movie. There were a number of genuine tense moments. Not scary (except for one scene where I actually jumped off my seat and it didn't have much to do with the visual stuff), it was just very well done. Also, this is one of those rare times that I actually WANT a sequel for even though I was quite satisfied with the movie.<br/><br/>Cons: The movie has nothing new to offer. It feels like you've already seen this movie. The special effects (which are quite minimal) take you out of the moment at times. Some stuff were left unexplained which will bother some people.<br/><br/>I don't see trailers (except for superhero and sci-fi movies) or read about movies beforehand so as not to spoil myself. So, some of the things were quite a pleasant surprise of sorts. All in all, a very solid addition to the genre and one I look forward to seeing again in the future.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I was expecting a lot of tension in this horror movie and I was aware of the fact, that the movie is based on classical horror movies. That's fine. But in the end I find it ""the Supernatural little movie brother"".<br/><br/>I respect the work with camera, I admired the stylization of 70's and loved the actors. There was also a very well done job with the sound and music. The atmosphere is very ""drama-like"", meaning exposition – collision – crisis – peripeteia – catastrophe and it was good delivered. But! Do we really need a movie that is inspired by the classics, but gives nothing new? That's what bothers me. Because if I wanted to see something that honors the classics, I would choose American Horror Story or Supernatural. As far as I'm concerned, I see a lot of parallels between this movie and SPN - family importance, hunters and their ""family business"", even the cars! The police officer's driving the Mustang! Warrens had their Chevrolet! Unlike this movie you can find the surplus value in SPN, e.g. Death x God and the other stuff as well...In this movie everything is clear, and the happy ending just made me laugh...<br/><br/>The craftsmanship is well done, but the unoriginality, no presence of surplus value made me vote for 6."

","This film is one of the scariest ghost and demon movies of the last couple of years. There are a number of genuinely frightening moments, and the film is quite original. But the whole is less than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>The story is said to be based on a true event. Some people apparently believe that. But a claim that a story is based on real events is generally - as it is in this case - just part of the advertising. No one really believes that the Blair Witch Project was real, or that the Amityville Horror was anything other than fiction. But some people have ben taken in by this film.<br/><br/>The possession/ghosts are not clearly distinguished. Just random events. The girls are not given individual characters - except for the eldest, who shows a very 21st century cynicism and cheek. Events are not connected, and most of the frights well telegraphed in advance.<br/><br/>This could have been a much better film, given more professional direction, and a bit more thought."

","I expected much more from 'The Conjuring' than it actually delivered. There are moments of tension, with the story revolving around the same old 'abandoned, haunted house' (like every other modern horror). So, what separates this from the rest? Not much. <br/><br/>The acting is pretty convincing, and the camera work is at times impressive. However, the only impression 'The Conjuring' left was that it was no more than religious propaganda - its message of God's and the Devil's existence at the end revealing the filmmaker's intention: to scare the audience into belief. <br/><br/>Heavily overrated."

Another negative though, is that for me the film failed to build tension or create a strong sense of atmosphere. That being said, I thought it was well crafted with strong performance's pretty much all round, and the film held my interest throughout.<br/><br/>All in all I recommend watching this one as despite a few flaws, there is still a solid, entertaining film here worthy of your time."

","I went to see The Conjuring today and I was disappointed. Having seen so many horror movies I guess I am jaded. Three-quarters of the film was filled with cheap scares- doors opening and closing, creaking this and that. It resembled a cheap rip-off of The Amityville Horror and The Shining. Only the loudness of these effects made some people jump- and that was just volume. Having said that the only redeeming quality was the last part of the movie- during the possession of the Mother.. Even if these manifestations really occurred at least the writers could have injected some artistic freedom and make it more spooky. If this was based on true accounts, then real horror is pretty boring."

","This movie had the possibility of being very interesting, but failed. The Warren's were the most interesting characters, and I feel the writers/director missed making a great movie by not focusing on the Warren's cases over their career. Instead the focus was primarily on the one related to the family in the movie, with little to know focus on who the warrens really were and how they got where they were. The movie itself was rather slow to get going, but even the more active parts were not scary for a Horror film. Basically they used incredibly loud audio to get a response from audience members. The fact that the possession described was a long dead witch definitely upped the lame factor. I had high hopes base don reviews, but it was not meant to be. Save your time, and look elsewhere."

","I love, love, horror movies, I grew up watching them, my parents didn't care what sorta movies I saw as a kid so I'm used to watching all sorts of movies. So once I saw the preview to The Conjuring months ago I was so excited to see it because just the preview alone gave me the chills. I kept nagging my boyfriend for months about how close July 19th was and how much critics were saying that this movie was super scary and one of the best. He doesn't care much for the sort of movies I watch most of the time especially the gory/horror ones which I get, they're stupid but I can't help but be entertained by them, since that's the point of movies. And what made me more excited about The Conjuring was that it was getting great reviews which is almost unheard of for horror movies now a days and I told my boyfriend that critics were giving this movie 5 stars and such. July 19th finally arrived and I was excited and my boyfriend not so much since he was either going to kill me for making him go and be traumatized for life or for wasting money on something stupid. After the movie finished he said well that was dumb, he wasn't even scared in fact he said it reminded him of The Exorcist/Poltergeist none of which he had seen until I forced him to. He said he was glad he had seen those two movies because it made The Conjuring less scary and he said he had seen The Conjuring already by watching those movies. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think The Conjuring was a bad movie, I just wasn't scared, in fact once we got home I had forgotten about it, I was expecting not being able to sleep for a few nights. Did I miss something? Was I expecting too much? Did I let all the reviews and anticipation get to me? I'm happy that a horror movie has finally gotten great reviews perhaps now it'll be a turning point for these sorts of films. However, I just left disappointed with The Conjuring, which is a shame."
"sabretoothrulz","9","3","7","16 July 2013"," Solid, but signals a well-worn genre
","James Wan, the creator of 'Saw' and 'Insidious'- and the significantly less successful 'Dead Silence'- brings us 'The Conjuring'. Seeing as these types of horror films have become more prolific it was only a matter of time before they began losing freshness; that is solely what damages 'The Conjuring' for me, regrettably.<br/><br/>There are numerous aspects of this film that have been done many times before in other movies, such as 'Sinister', 'Paranormal Activity' 1-4 and Wan's own 'Insidious'. With that being said, they are accomplished remarkably and effectively well here. The problem lies with how there is only so much you can do with one sub-genre, and 'The Conjuring' marks the first time I have noticed these elements beginning to stale no matter how well executed. <br/><br/>Was I scared? Absolutely! In that way the movie succeeds 100%, especially in the second half. Never is it unintentionally funny, and the cast is as excellent as their performances- Vera Farmiga particularly. Although also somewhat familiar, the story behind the 'haunting' is pretty well done considering it can be a snagging point in these types of horror films.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring' signifies the need for a change in this horror sub-genre, and despite being executed brilliantly and having a perfect cast, too many aspects are overly familiar and worn- out- still, I won't be getting much sleep tonight."

"Dorjee_Wang","5","2","4","19 June 2015"," Typical and overrated
","The Conjuring might make the list of most overrated movies of all time. Another attempt at horror by James Wan (Insidious series, Saw, etc.), The Conjuring spirals into a typical horror movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a family moving into a new house (which happens in majority of supernatural horror), and the land on which house sits hides a sinister secret (another typical thing). The Conjuring parallels Insidious, in the sense of a mother trying to protect her kids from evil forces. It's a nice thought but doesn't do much for the movie as it goes downhill from midway through with Ed-Lorraine and their crew setting up paranormal kits like CAMERA and EMP detectors all over the house in an attempt to catch the so-called demon(Ghost Adventures anyone?). The climatic exorcism scenes might work for some non-Horror fans who gets scared at everything, but for someone who has been watching all of his life feels like a lazy effort with the climax especially going into the realm of overdramatics.<br/><br/>While Vera and Lili does sell the roles of mothers well (they were great, let's give it to them) and Wilson does well too, the supporting casts were glaringly subpar in their roles with Ron Livingston's attempt at playing a father being the weakest of them all.<br/><br/>Overall, it's not a bad movie at all, but it's not great either because the plot is nothing but cliché (the same old ""move into a new house, get terrorised by an evil spirit"" story) with some really overdramatic scenes (especially the climax). Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor did really good in the movie but the other performance fell short of them. The Conjuring is really overrated when there are scarier movies out there with some unique stories. 6/10"
"peter-stead-740-486963","6","2","4","4 August 2014"," Everything good but the script
","Acting, Direction, Cinematography, Effects, all of these are good and all will have you jumping in places. The film's problem is that the script is nearly 100% flat exposition and nearly 0% character development. This means that you don't care what happens to the characters, you aren't gripped. <br/><br/>The story also leads you into some dead ends. Vera Farmiga's character saw something which traumatised her in one of her previous exorcisms - does it tie into the main story? Do we find out what it was? Nope.<br/><br/>You work out how the story is going to end before the Investigators do, which is unsatisfying from a denouement point of view.<br/><br/>There is an entire menagerie of ghosts, not just the main one. This destroys the focus of the story.<br/><br/>Much of the spooky goings on are VERY similar to other films, The Exorcist, The Grudge - you'd be better off watching those.<br/><br/>Compare this to Skeleton Key or What Lies Beneath, how the character's stories pull you in, how original they were, how there was a twist. Next to these, The Conjuring comes off like an extended and well-produced episode of Ghost Adventures."

Most of the people giving it a 1 are either hating on it because they expected gore and special effects galore, or, and this one kills me, took offence at the religious nature of possession.

","The Conjuring is decent, especially for the very-difficult-to-do-it-well horror subgenre ""Supernatural Thriller.""<br/><br/>The acting was good. But also the script: Early on we are told that this story is based on actual accounts of a haunted house as described by the notorious Roman-Catholic paranormal investigators Ed & Lorraine Warren. (Who also investigated the haunted house Amityville Horror is based on.)<br/><br/>Then there is the semi-skeptical Ed Warren, who is quick to acknowledge actual demonic activity is rare, and tries at first to shrug it off as drafts and swelling and old pipes.<br/><br/>Reminders that the Catholic Church recognizes demonic spirits and exorcisms in their doctrine also created some plays ability. (Coming from a country where XX % of people identify as Christian, this is important.)<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson had a standout performance as Ed Warren; this character was the most interesting & believable. His eyes and demeanor portrayed the internal conflict of a paranormal investigator on the defensive against a world of skeptics, weighing his personal beliefs that he and his wife were chosen by God to fight demons against his instinct to protect her against the evil forces of the universe. <br/><br/>You can tell a lot of love went into this movie. The Wilson's demonology room is AWESOME I wish I could poke around in there with all the creepy dolls & toys & supernatural conduits. The old wooden farmhouse was fantastic, especially the hidden passages and exposed copper pipes. The movie is set in 1971, Ed & Lorraine Warren's wardrobe is enviable.<br/><br/>My only gripe with The Conjuring were the sub-par malevolent spirits: First of all, the demon possessed doll Anabelle. The whole 5 year old starved for attention, I'm going to write on the walls with a red crayon didn't do it for me. <br/><br/>And then there's Bathsheeba, who is supposed to be one bad bitch. I was hoping for something a little more dynamic and psychologically terrifying than the ghost of some 18th century farm wife who is mean only because 'she loves Satan.' Her character was kind of stale.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good movie. Solid storytelling, solid acting, and great suspense from the director. The evil spirits, however, were forgettable."

Sure a lot of the ideas in this movie has been done before but sometimes what matters is how it's all integrated into the movie. Which is done great for this one. It's takes the perspective of the family that is being haunted with a couple that is a clairvoyant and demonologist that goes around investigating paranormal activities. There is quite a bit of tension in this movie and the audiences seemed to be scared while enjoying the experience. Now this movie is based on true event but like all movies of this sort, it does go in a over exaggerated and far-fetched direction. But didn't come off overly cheesy and lame. Despite few different style of horror movies and creepy elements that gets mixed into this movie, it just didn't seem forced or a convoluted mess. In fact it all fits into the story. But yeah some of the cliché's can get tiresome or numb to. Like dog and child only ones being able to see ghosts, moving pictures, no matter how scary or creepy it gets they always decide to get their magnifying glass and go to the dark messed up areas to investigate and etc. The scares builds very slowly but it worth it for the most part. I saw few guys kinda tensing up and even squirming in there chairs while watching this movie. And when a girl behind me accidentally kicked her popcorn bucket during a tense scene.

There are certain exposition scenes, that that if you pay attetion you pretty much seen the whole movie.<br/><br/>I may be exagerating, but if you like a grand spectacle of paranormal demonic stuff that doesn't make any sense, that's the only way you gonna sit through this movie til the end, and enjoy it. This movie asks for to much in the first act, we are left with this constant feeling that something is coming, but does that in the worst way possible, as we follow this characters for way to long as they wander through the scene waiting for a scare, and my god, those characters have nothing, they are walking talking souless manequins, the movie gives you absolutely nothing to care about, and personally, i was very bored. Even when the tension began to build up, and the scares were happening, i could see almost everyone of them coming a mile away, so that didn't help to my experience...<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are great in this movie, and that helps a lot, as soon as the second act begins and we get more of them the movie picks up, they are great.

The Conjuring is a very blend horror, that gets saved by its director that has a very cool style and vision, James Wan is great, and its protagonists, and overall cast as well, everyone does their job really well here, unfortunatelly, they don't have much to work with, as this movie barely has a plot or character development, it just asks us to turn our brain off and enjoy a senseless paranormal spectacle, and that's not for me, if it works for foi that's fine."

No, there is no original creative story to it, yes at moments it is cliche (it is set in the 70's, In a haunted house, clearly the directors watched a horror movie before and they clearly do not try to avoid cliche's, it is basically the whole charm of the movie). The characters are not that complex, the story is not deep, the acting is a bit unrealistic at times, and the ghosts look like we have seen them before but as a whole I think this movie works and delivers just what a movie like this should be delivering."

","The Conjuring was perfectly balanced in terms of jump-scares, anxiety and excellent story line. Each of the characters was portrayed well. This book left me with thrills I can't shake days later. It was scary, but nothing extreme. No sex, no drugs, no unnecessary gore and even the length of the film was perfect. This reignited my enjoyment of watching films so much so I made an account to review it."

","In anticipation of the forthcoming The Conjuring 2 release, I was able to convince (I threatened them to cut them into bite sized morsels to go with fava beans and a nice chianti) Pillow Talking to let me review The Conjuring, considered one of the most financially successful horror films of all time. The film took 15 years and about $20 million to make it and when it was released in 2013 it grossed over $300 million. So many die-hard horror fans out there! If I had a heart, it would swell with pride!<br/><br/>The screenplay and story were based on the files of two very sick, real-life demonologists, Ed and Lorraine Warren. Originally, the story focused on one of their case studies, the Perron family farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. But the script later was changed to include the Warrens' story as well. It received critical praise when it was released.<br/><br/>The story is a mash-up of many established and horrific themes and, consequently, there are many homages to classic horror films. For example, The Amityville Horror, Child's Play (Chucky), Poltergeist, The Exorcist, the notorious Exorcist-rip Beyond the Door, and even Hitch's The Birds all receive their share of bites.<br/><br/>The plot is sickeningly familiar. Paranormal investigators and demonologists, the Warrens, are contacted to investigate hauntings going on at the Perron family farmhouse in Rhode Island. What starts out as some mild poltergeist activity morphs into demonic possession with roots going back to a witch who lived at the farm in the 1600s. It's the classic good vs. evil struggle with innocence (children) caught in the middle.<br/><br/>To its credit, the film is an atavistic throwback to the 1970s horror films that relied on scares rather than straight-up gore (which is appropriate since the film takes place in the 70s). As actor and producer Steve Coogan said, ""A woman wearing a revealing dress will always be sexier than a naked woman."" And so it is with true horror. Indeed, the film forces our imaginations to work for a change, rather than showing us every explicit detail via CGI.<br/><br/>Although there are many frightening moments, the film never reaches a Jasonian or Krugerian level. The split between the two focuses (the Warren's story and the Perron family farmhouse) is a bit distracting. The Anabelle haunted doll intro (which was the subject of its own feature-length horror film in 2014) seems a wasted and out of place exposition.<br/><br/>The only celebrity name who was recognizable was indie maven Lili Taylor of Mystic Pizza, Say Anything, and Rudy fame. She was Ripper smooth as a possessed soccer mom. Too bad she won't be in the sequel.<br/><br/>And speaking of the sequel, The Conjuring 2 promises more scares and sleepless nights as Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga recreate their roles as Mr. and Mrs. Demonologist and head to the UK to exorcise some British demons (who I'm certain will be more regimented than our wildcat American demons).<br/><br/>Both The Conjuring and its sequel are directed by veteran horror director James Wan who is probably best known for directing Saw in 2004.<br/><br/>While The Conjuring certainly was a critical and financial success, I felt it fell just short of ""classic horror"" status. However, in the capable hands of Wan and more coin in the budget for a sequel, The Conjuring 2 may be the next Jasonian Exorcist."

"g-chenfan","10","0","0","1 May 2019"," Classic Haunted House Horror Movie
","It been a long time since I've been a good horror movie. As of late, too many claimed horror movies rely on jump scares, excessive violence or gore, spooky soundtrack and special effects to scare you. Few directors have been able to replicate the sense of dread and terror that William Friedkin was able to do in the original Exorcist with no sound at all and just long slow shots. Jame Wan not only brought back that sense of dread but also plays into the classic haunted house movie. The movie does start out a little slow, but in my opinion, it allows you to get to know the family/characters better without rushing in to the scares. Since the movie was made in 2013, you can't expect no CGI in any movie, but was minimally used for this film. You're also introduced to two icons in the Paranormal Investigation world, which is a nice addition if you're into that sort of thing.<br/><br/>This movie will deliver for any fans of classic style haunted house horror movies without the use of cheap jump scares or gore and will easily rank up there with any of the classics to be a timeless horror movie for all to enjoy."

I loved how plot is about a normal family that happened to be in the wrong house and gets possessed by demons. You can usually expect when things are going to pop out, but you won't know WHAT would pop out. This film has a good balance of sweet moments and scary moments, which I really appreciate since I get scared easily! The sweet moments remind viewers that people who are possessed have lives, too. I know when a scary movie is good when I can't stop thinking about it at night. Although it may have traumatized me a little bit, I enjoyed how the history of the house unfolded. The movie does has a few goofs in it, but it did not take away from the experience of the film. The movie would have been better if there were more unexpected surprises to give the audience more of a scare. Overall, it is a great movie if you want a scare and are interested in demonic possession."

"wesolowskic","9","0","0","13 March 2019"," Really good, highly recommend.
","I have seen an absolute ton of horror movies, if you named a horror movie, I have most likely seen it. I have been watching horror movies since I was ten years old so I know a good horror movie from a bad one. In my opinion, none of them are scary but that is just a personal preference. Many others who have watched the same movie, said that after watching the movie they were terrified of what was haunting, murdering, etc that person or group of people, but not me. Though, the Conjuring isn't like most other scary movies. Unlike the movie, Silence of the Lambs, Paranormal Activity, the Shining, and most other horror movies, the Conjuring is based on a true story that happened in the mid-1950's. This case was taken over by Ed and Lorraine Warren and if you didn't know already, they used to be very popular ghost hunters that have solved many other paranormal cases that had happened. The Conjuring is highly recommended to those who are interested in horror movies or paranormal things. I would say it is one of the more better horror movies that has come out this decade not only because it is based on a true story, but also because the cast does a phenomenal job portraying what had really happened once.<br/><br/>The Perron family, a family of seven, just moved to their new farm house in Rhode Island trying to get a new fresh start to their life. Quickly, some really creepy and paranormal things start to occur. The dog refuses to come into the house, the wife Carolyn starts getting bruises yet, she has done nothing to achieve them, clapping from an unknown source fills the house, and a horrific appearance of an inhuman creature occurs. Also a horrid smell randomly occurs, and the house is constantly freezing even though they have the heat on which if you didn't know already, that usually means that there is a dangerous paranormal figure is present in the house. That isn't even half of all the horrific or paranormal like things that has happened to the Perron family. After all of these occurrences, Carolyn goes out to seek help from the popular and well known demonologist and clairvoyant, Ed and Lorraine Warren, who have done a number of other cases involving the paranormal since that is what they are trained to do. Therefore, the Warren's will then go to the Perron's house trying to get rid of the terror which will allow for the family to live happily and safely once again. But you'll have to watch the movie to find out if they do get rid of all the paranormal in the Perron's house and how they did it.<br/><br/>The Conjuring has a lot of very good aspects of it yet, it does have some bad but it doesn't really make it a bad movie. When the creators of the movie came together to write the script, they had twisted up the paranormal case the movie is based off of to make it a bit more interesting. This doesn't make it bad, it just makes it more interesting. If you wanted to watch the Conjuring thinking all of the paranormal events had actually happened, well you're out of luck. There are a few things that didn't happen in real life and I would say them, but then I would be spoiling the cooler parts of the movie which is not good. But if you are looking for a paranormal horror movie that is based on a true story and all of the events had actually happened, well you're out of luck because movie creators have to mess with the actual case in order for people to actually want to watch the movie. But other than the slight changes of the case, it has very many good aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>All throughout the movie you are going to wonder, ""This scene actually happened in real life? That's insane that this occurred!"" which is what makes the movie so good. The first time I watched the movie, I had been thinking about how crazy the world is and how insane paranormal things can happen to literally anyone. Though I do not believe in the paranormal, it is just crazy to think that if they were to exist, that any paranormal event that has occured in the movies could potentially happen to you. But the movie is so realistic and the actors do such an amazing job portraying the pain and fear that had once occurred to the actual Perron family. I won't spoil it, but at the very end of the movie the actor Lili Taylor (Carolyn Perron) did such an amazing job showing the fear and pain the wife had actually gone through in real life. It seemed so realistic that it was almost like raw footage (that was filmed ever so nicely) from the actual event which is so good. All the actors that were in that scene most definitely helped it seem so realistic and they all did such an amazing job. That scene (and the whole movie), is most definitely worth watching because all the actors casted in the movie do an absolute amazing job to help it seem so raw and realistic. Other than that one scene, the whole movie seemed so real and was acted out so well and really shows what happened once. Also to some, the movie might just leave you terrified. Critic Paul Asay would most definitely agree with that statement, ""This James Wan scarefest is frighteningly effective and surprisingly spiritual. But the images it offers will haunt you long after you turn the lights back on"". I was not left scared but my mom most definitely was. She says that sometimes she still thinks of what was haunting the family and can't fall asleep, so maybe you will be left scared as well.<br/><br/>If you go off to watch the Conjuring and love it and want more, well you're in luck. The creators of the movie came out with its sequel, the Conjuring 2 in 2016. The movie is very similar to the first Conjuring and I recommend it as well. The movie, The Nun, is also an addition to the Conjuring series. All three movies are based off of a true story and are all recommended by me. They will all leave you scared and wishing for more. I guarantee that if you are a fan of horror movies, the paranormal, or movies based on true stories, you will love the Conjuring and its other movies because it has all three of those aspects."
"victorsilva-23877","9","0","0","25 February 2019"," The perfect horror blend
","I believe The Conjuring is a masterful blend of everything that makes the haunting genre fun. If your hoping for something new and fresh, you won't get that. You've seen this before. Director James Wan takes many of the iconic horror tropes and executes them skillfully. There are obviously jump scares, but they aren't fake outs, they are meant to scare you and succeed at that. Wan crafts his sequences amazingly and creates some truly tension filled scenes. The sound design is immaculate and every little sound heard adds to the suspense. While slow paced to begin with, the film really gets going and keeps things tense until the last frame. James Wan nailed the overall feel of the haunting in this film and it may be some of his best work yet"

","The main goal for any horror movie is to make you too afraid to leave your closet open at night or to have your feet sticking out of your blankets while you're sleeping and The Conjuring does just that. Director James Wan does an amazing job to create a spine-chilling experience while at the same time having you fall in love with the characters and their family
Wan starts off the movie with great suspense by using intense music to lead to a back story of the doll who started it all. Two young nurses tell their story of how they allow the spirit of a 7-year-old girl named Annabelle to move into the doll they have in their apartment. They continue with stories of the doll moving and doing things all over their apartment such as drawing on the walls and destroying everything. This is how we meet paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. They are the ones who introduce the demon and explain how he used the doll and Annabelle as a way to get to the girls and possess them. Wan uses this to give the viewer information on demons and paranormal spirits that they might need to help explain later scenes. It then cuts to a family of 7 moving into a new house. That we later find out has a demonic presence in it that tries to take over the family. Once the family experiences this presence in many different ways they turn to Ed and Lorraine to help them out. They end up finding out that a woman who lived in the house when it was first built had a history of witchcraft proclaimed her loved to Satan and cursed anyone who moved there along with many other disturbing details. Ed and Lorraine continue to work with this family to try and get rid of this nasty demon.
James Wan does an amazing job to connect all of the stories in the Conjuring universe together. This includes both of The Conjuring's, the Annabelle movies and The Nun. Whether it be using the same doll or the same characters, it really impacts the overall story. Wan has also directed other very popular movies such as The Insidious series, Lights Out, the Saw movies, Furious 7, and Aquaman. Major props to this man for being so creative and being able to find ways to leave impacts on people with these movies.
One of my absolute favorite things about this movie is that is based on a true story. At the beginning of the movie one of the major ways he shows the viewers this is by putting text on the screen about who the Warren's really are and then ends the paragraph with the isolated sentence of, ""Based on the true story."" I think the way he made that sentence stand by itself was very powerful and made the movie become so much scarier for the audience. Also at the end of the movie, they literally added pictures of the real-life Warrens and Annabelle doll. Doing that gets rid of all the doubting thoughts that come to mind and makes it even more astounding. After seeing these pictures, I for sure wanted to learn more about the Warrens and their stories so I looked them up on the internet and found even more information about them. It is a big thing when you can say a story is true because in my opinion what really makes a viewer terrified is the fact that things like this could happen to them. If the movie is super unrealistic the director really has to focus on incorporating other blood-curdling aspects to add to make it scarier.
Another aspect of James Wan's work that is very expressive is the way that he uses very dark rooms to represent all of the evil. I think this is a good technique because we associate the dark with sinister, scary things and the light with the good, virtuous things. We also associate the dark with unknown things which makes the perfect opportunity for jump scares which Wan is very skilled at integrating into his scary movies. He makes sure to build up the intense music to make the shock even greater and jump even higher. I feel like adding suspenseful music and sounds make the anticipation so tremendous and just adds the serious thrill to scary movies.
I will admit you can definitely see some things coming but, they crafted the movie so well that it'll still get your hair to stand on end. Not only is it scary but it has such an appreciable plot that just makes you want to keep seeing more from the Perron and Warren families. By the end of the movie, I was so emotionally connected to the characters that this will forever be my favorite series, even though it may leave me to believe I am seeing things in the shadows late at night."
"ironcraftleague","8","0","0","16 January 2019"," James Wan made a masterpiece.
","This is one of the horror movies from this generation that I want to become a classic in the future because it's a good film that I actually really liked. It was scary at moments, it had suspense, the characters are cool and interesting to watch. The most interesting to simply just watch and learn about is Lorraine, which not to bring the movie down is sometimes just used as a plot device. However, I'm not mad, it's still pretty cool that's she's a clairvoyant and she can see demons. Actually, unlike some movies this demon stuff is actually pretty easy to follow, so I get immursed and invested. The cinematography is great, they're camera shots that made me more engaged. My favorite thing from the film would have to be the exorsim and the events after that. It legitimately had me on the edge of my seat. However, some things don't work like acting was off sometimes and some minor flaws throw off the experience. Aside from that, it was pretty good. 8/10."
"punch87","9","0","0","13 January 2019"," A great antidote to your standard dehumanizing horror movie.
","James Wan has become a master of the modern horror flick; distancing himself from the torture porn trend he began with Saw, focusing instead on using old-school horror tricks to their best advantage. We may have seen these scare set pieces before (e.g. the possessed doll, the dark cellar, the crows flying into the house) and we know how music manipulates us to create jumps, but Wan pulls these off in such a way that the film feels both fresh and terrifying.<br/><br/>He's achieved that, in part, by paying homage to the type of horror films he loves from the 1970s. Most of the effects in The Conjuring were created practically on set, rather than through a computer, which makes them feel all the more real. The cinematography by Frank Leonetti is simple and beautiful, and together with Wan, has created some creepy images, which may become iconic and possibly will be lampooned by the Wayans brothers at some point."

","I read in advance that this movie contain minimal violence (although it certainly does contain some violence), little swearing and no sex or nudity. Why the reputation for being such a terrifying movie then? Simple answer: this is a masterclass in the art of the jump scare.<br/><br/>The premise is familiar: family move into a haunted house and turn to experienced 'demonologists' for salvation. Nothing original there. The fun (if you can call it that) comes with the masterful execution. The acting is pretty good for haunted house movie and the characters have enough depth to be emotionally engaging. The real driver of this movie is in the deployment of jump scares. Jump scares are such a horror trope and can come across as cheesy and cheap but this movie is built on them and does then really really well.<br/><br/>I'm tempted now to watch the sequels although, given that this movie makes you feel constantly on edge, this could make for more stressful (but satisfying) viewing."

"a_chinn","8","0","0","22 October 2018"," Well crafted and effective, although derivative, haunted house story
","No blood. No gore. No violence. But wonderfully suspenseful and scary haunted house story from director James Wan (""Saw"" ""Furious 7"" and the underrated ""Death Sentence""). The film is ""based on a true story"" of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson & Vera Farmiga) helping a family (Ron Livingston, Lili Taylor, and their brood of children) experiencing frightening and escalating supernatural attacks in their newly moved into rural home. Wan does a fine job of building suspense and in creating a dark unsettling atmosphere. A wonderfully eerie sound design greatly adds to the film's unsettling feel. If you're wondering how scary the film is, it managed to get an R-rating without any nudity, almost no profanity, and bloodless violence, earning the rating solely for it's pervasive frightening nature. The downside to the film is that although it's effectively suspenseful and scary, the story is is disappointingly derivative and familiar, with many similarities to other films, ranging from Robert Wise's ""The Haunting"" to Tobe Hooper & Steven Spielberg's ""Poltergeist"" to even the ""The Grudge."" Another disappointment is that Wan relies on a jump scare several times too often, which is pretty much the cheapest scare you can put into a horror film. Master of Horror John Carpenter once said it doesn't take any talent to make a jump scare, saying all you need to do is run a series of black frames and then splice in a white frame with a loud noise and you'll make the audience jump. One or two jump scares might be acceptable, but Wan goes to this well far too often and it comes off as a lazy way to scare the audience. Still, despite Wan's perchance for easy scares, he has made a film with believable characters and created a eerily atmospheric film that is well worth watching for horror fans, even if you've seen this type of story at lease a dozen times before."

10/15/18 <br/><br/> The movie The Conjuring achieves the desired effect of horror through the director's portrayal of the story. The storyline and theme helped the director's vision for the movie come to be a plaudits film. 
 The Perron family moved into a new, old house that has a dark past. This was the house many murders were committed in. A churlish demon is attached to this house and has been waiting for someone to move in, so it can possess the weakest of the new owners. The writers Chad Hays and Carey W. Hays have a true understanding of the horror genre, they wrote a simple well-known plot and the director James Wan took the storyline to the next level. The storyline is strongly supported by the sequencing of scenes and is believable within the context of the movies premise. The story unfolded through the dialogue and action of the main characters, The Perron on family knew that something was wrong when their daughters started seeing things, they were hearing noises, and there was a nasty smell roaming the house. The family of seven was portrayed as your happy average family in the beginning but when the real monster comes out the family is defeated and looking for any way to get out of that house. The amazing cast in this movie brought it all together from their smiles to their screams the collaboration made the storyline come to life. The theme of this movie is very compelling to the average horror movie lover, a basic theme that evolved into a bone chilling and heart racing movie. The theme is formulaic if you have enjoyed many horror movies before while if you are new to the horror community it is original. Watching many horror movies gives you a sense of what will happen next and it can become boring if the movie is too predictable but The Conjuring hits you with unexpected jump scares and heart pounding suspense that will still surprise you even when you know it is coming. The premise for this movie is realistic because the paranormal activity gives the average ""ghosts aren't real"" believing viewer the feeling of not knowing their own senses and they will be looking over their shoulder that night. 
 At the end of this movie there is one last jump scare that leads to the end credits rolling and doll music playing to leave you with one last tingling sense that the demon is there alongside you. The director and the writers' vision were accomplished just by a storyline, theme, and carefully picked music."

","The Conjuring Review
The Conjuring is an intensely scary movie. A combination of story, visuals, music and acting all brilliantly tied together by the creativity of director James Wan contribute to the horror and overall fear infliction of the movie. The Conjuring was truly a revelation in the genre of horror because it stayed true to the source material throughout the whole movie. The Conjuring left me feeling satisfied while also leaving me yearning for more. The movie is based on a true story and has many detailed scenes and story which make the movie all the more horrifying. The main protagonists of the movie are Ed, Patrick Wilson, and Lorraine Warren, Vera Farmiga. Loraine, who is a clairvoyant, can see the sprits that inhabit the house. They are demonologist, who study demons for a living, and help many people who feel they are having paranormal trouble. After the Perron family move into their new house in Rhode Island, they soon realize that something is horribly wrong. They ask for the Warren's aid who soon figure out that there are many spirits haunting the house and have jostled their way into the Carolyn Perron, Lili Taylor, the mother. Ed and Lorraine now must help the Perrons to the best of their ability.
James Wan almost perfectly recreates the Perron house, up to the pictures on the wall, and the closets in the rooms. He also keeps a classic spooky setting. The house is mainly isolated from the rest of the town and has many well-designed hidden areas and compartments. Joe Dzuban, director of sound, makes a great job of creating every creak of the door to the footsteps on the floor as suspenseful as possible. Joe Dzuban also designs a discordant sound that suits the sounds of the demon's voice. Even though the visuals of the demons felt mildly basic, they were still able to add to the aesthetics of the movie. The acting of the movie felt genuine and realistic. Actress Vera Farmiga was outstanding in her role as Loraine Warren. This was especially shown when she is seeing her visions and demons. The demons are mainly showed through the perspective of the Warrens but through scene transitions, camera angles and the action, the perspective of the Perrons is also briefly shown. The theme of the conjuring is a more formulaic but Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes, writers, make it fit almost effortlessly to the story and premise. The theme focused on the power of family and love. In the end of the movie Bathsheba, the evil spirit, Joseph Bishara, is taking revenge on anyone who tries to take her land. After being accused of witchcraft during her lifetime and sacrificing her child to the devil, she has been haunting everyone that had lived on her land and sacrificing them to Satin. Now she is trying to do the same to Carolyn Perron and her family. Ed warren is forced to complete the exorcism because there is not enough time to wait for the priest. During the exorcism, the mother begins to hover above the ground as Bathsheba continued to resist. Now only the mother can fight back against Bathsheba by remembering about her beloved family and the love between them. As she realizes that she is stronger than the spirit, she successfully defeats Bathsheba and the rest of the evil spirits. As Bathsheba and the rest of the evil spirits are sent back to the underworld, Claire begins to revert back to her normal self."

","Movie Review
The Conjuring exhibits what the peak of directing and writing is as director James Wan and writer Chad Hayes creates a bone chilling horror movie that draws on a standard horror movie build but strays enough to maintain its own originality. The unknown danger of the darkness that the horror movie creates draws out the pure terror that it has created and scares the audience out of their seats. 
The movie opens with the Perron family moving into their new house attempting to start a new life, unknowing of the demons awaiting them. Director James Wan and writer Chad Hayes tells an amazing story coming from Carolyn Perron's perspective through action and dialogue that evolves as it progresses. As Carolyn and the Perron family begin to live their lives in an old, abandoned, citadel of a mansion in the middle of nowhere, the demons start to slowly affect their lives until it becomes unbearable. This is how Won shows his mastery of directing skills as he uses odd camera angles, lighting, and other limited resources to make the demonic activity look so realistic that the audience starts to believe it. The sound crew tops it off with the brilliant sound track and folly. The sound director Joe Dzuban demonstrates his brilliance by creating an utterly breathtaking creepy and unnerving sound track along with a ominous folly that fits the scene. It creates tension like no other. This combined with the heart pounding tension of people exploring places the viewers know they should not. This allows for suspense and dramatic irony as we know that the demon is where the protagonist does. At the same time the audience does not know where the demon will attack, so the audience waits in tension for the demons to attack. All these make the audience sit at the edge of their seats.
The already amazing ending of the film is all but amplified by ho well suited the actors are for their roles. After the family can no longer tolerate the demon, they seek out help in the form of two demonologist, Ed and Loraine. Then the demon possesses the mon, Carolyn, and Ed has to exercise the demon. During this scene the actors act so emotional and realistic that it makes us sympathetic. They would cry and scream their heart out, and it would make their voices sound truly terrified. The actors were already breathtaking but the director makes it even better with his own ties to not only the actors but the characters as well. This makes his ability to utilize their roles even better. He also stays focused at the task at hand and knows how to mesh is work with others. These elevated this movie to new heights.
All in all, the conjuring is one of the best supernatural horror/thriller movies of its time, and little did we know that this little excerpt from a true story would become this great movie. This is largely due to its engrossing story, amazing directing, and acting. In the end you should definitely watch it if you have not already and it definitely gets a plaudits from me and the audience."

"machocabrio","6","0","0","23 September 2018"," What's with the hype?
","Horror is one of my favorite genres in film, I think it says a lot about our nature and it takes a lot of skill to create a truly frightening experience for moviegoers. I stayed away from The Conjuring series because I felt it had everything that's boring and predictable about modern American horror just by reading the accolades it got. I wasn't interested in Annabelle or The Nun or any other James Wan related flick for that matter -though the first Saw is really ok just for the ending. I have a lot of friends and follow a lot of critics whose opinions I respect a lot and they all praise this film so much that I though ""Well, there MUST be something really cool about it. I might be missing something good"". And I rented it and watched it at 1 AM with all the lights turned off and... You know, all the ritual for horror fans. I wasn't disappointed, it was what I expected: a well directed, well acted (Farmiga and Wilson are amazing actors) mediocre jump-scare fest. It is by no means a bad film, but i isn't worth of it's hype and in no way deserves to have so many sequels and spin-offs. If this is the best of the series, how bland and generic could the rest be? I'm really surprised to see how many people connect with this when it delivers a poor atmosphere, the scares are really dull and uninspiring, the supernatural makeup is terrible. The best scene for me was the hair-pulling possession, that was really nice, but other than that I felt it never delivered anything new to the genre or even something remotely frightening. It was just ok, and it saddens me to think this type of film (along with Insidious and Sinister, which I haven't seen either and after this experience I'm not planning on never seeing them at all) is what American horror is now about. How dull! I love The VVitch for it's tense atmosphere and for being such a beautiful portray of witch-era tales, and Hereditary is an amazing horror-drama with a subpar plot twist that left me feeling cheated, but still I felt like watching something fresh and chilling. It wasn't the case with The Conjuring and I just can't see what everyone sees in it. I was right about it all along."

Okay, I'll qualify that, I did wonder what was going to appear from behind the sheet.

","I saw this movie rather late based on numerous recommendations- I tend to watch older horror movies more than new ones. Since I love James Wan, I was really looking forward to seeing this one. And it definitely lived up to my expectations; The Conjuring is a really good horror movie and I fully recommend it to anyone that loves creepy movies.<br/><br/>Firstly, the acting is great all across the board. Aside from the two women in the beginning of the movie that talked about the Annabelle doll (I didn't think they were particularly good), everyone was top-notch. The direction is also incredible- James Wan has already proved himself and I look forward to seeing his other films. There are some incredibly intricate and mesmerizing shots that added to the sense of unease that I got while I was watching it. The pacing is also absolutely impeccable- there were very few dull moments in the movie and everything built up to the very intense third act beautifully. I also really liked Ed and Lorraine Warren a lot- they were great characters. A lot of the scares were also very creative and did not feel cliché at all (the infamous clap scene is one of the best jump scares I have ever seen).<br/><br/>I do have some problems with the movie, though. First of all, the actual family (the Perrons) were never really fleshed out as characters. I thought that they were fine and I did find myself rooting for them when things were going wrong, but I feel like there could have been so much more emotional weight throughout the film if I got to know those characters. Also, there were some scare scenes were very repetitive to the point where I actually think some of them should have been cut from the movie. I really did not need to see 7-8 scenes in which a door slams shut- I think that 1 or 2 would have done the trick. There were also some questions raised that were not answered (I don't know if they are addressed in the sequel since I have not seen it). For example, what did Lorraine see that scarred her so deeply? I was so invested in that mystery and not finding out what she saw was pretty deflating. The movie also isn't all that original; the fact that it is based off of a true story definitely separates it from typical haunted house movies, but I really don't mind the fact that it's not entirely unique since it was such a well-made movie.<br/><br/>Overall, The Conjuring is a really creepy and effective horror movie. I really wish that all horror movies nowadays had as much effort put into them as this movie clearly did. Although I have yet to see the sequel, this movie was so good that I cannot wait to see what the next one brings to the table.<br/><br/>8.2/10 Grade: B+"
"tokanac","10","0","0","27 September 2017"," This is what nightmares are made of!
","I have never seen this movie or its advertising, so I was going in blind, and quite pleasantly surprised!<br/><br/>There are many horror and thriller flicks out there, and it's hard to pick just one, but horror and thriller flicks, these days, have become soft, revealing way too much before the end, especially the antagonist. It's always the same story-line: a group of friends go out to a secluded cabin in the woods where a bunch of scary stuff happens, and the antagonist, who is usually shown from behind or as a silhouette as he (or she) carries out his evil deeds, is always one of the friends! Usually the antagonist, as well as a group member, is a jilted lover.<br/><br/>I really need to give James Wan, the director, credit here for bringing Chad and Carey's vision to life creatively, and surrounding himself with the right kind of people who support him; the film is really well executed! While other directors give way too much away before the movie even begins, James doesn't give anything away easily – it's not until much later that you find out the who and why!<br/><br/>Wan may give you glimpses of who is antagonising the family in the second act, but not fully until the third.<br/><br/>Wan also ties in previous events throughout the movie and references other horror flicks, most notably being Annabelle. <br/><br/>Whether or not it is actually based on true events, it's a great movie and will have you on the edge of your seats with your heart pumping, jumping at the right moments, skin crawling, eyes bulging and palms sweaty. Everything you want in a horror flick!<br/><br/>I hope more of James, Chad and Carey's movies are as thrilling and horrifying as this one was and still is! I can't wait to watch the Conjuring 2!"

Superb acting by all actors, and Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson are just unbelievable believable in their roles as a couple hunting and fighting satanic forces. The Conjuring is a roller-coaster-ride of suspense and horrors and if more movies of the genre would have such good acting, production, and high-octane horror-level, horror movies would rule the universe like Emperor Ming.<br/><br/>Even if you usually don't like or watch horror movies, this one, you should watch.<br/><br/>Note: the 2nd movie is also a good one but not so impressive and nerve-racking."

","Having not watched any of the director's Saw films and assuming the Conjuring films to be over hyped, actually watching this was a considerable shock. This film is scary. With some knowledge as to the background, due to my late father's activity in the field, I found myself completely involved from the start. Before I could begin to wonder if we really were going to spend the whole of the movie in a haunted house, I found myself overwhelmed with the increasing activity and malevolent atmosphere. A family of five girls was the right way to go, whether or not this had any basis on the real story, because it added to the creepiness and seeming vulnerability of them. There are loud crashes and sudden movements to make the viewer jump but it is the way the whole awful tale is told and the intensity that gets under the skin and makes this such a very successful and surprisingly good horror."

So much for ""Based on a True Story."" <br/><br/>As for the movie, how does one create a film with a $20 Million Dollar budget and have it filled with goofs, continuity errors and faulty sets? Oddly enough I was particularly irritated by the work of Art Director Geoffrey S Grimson and Set Decorator Sophie Neudorfer.

"RossRivero99","9","0","0","2 August 2017"," One of the finest horror films of the decade
","James Wan's ""the Conjuring"" is a far better horror film than I had expected it to be, but four years ago when it was released into theaters I thought it was about a person being possessed but when you watch it for the first time you will find out that it is so much more than that. The movie is based on the true story of Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) who have five daughters named Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver), who then move into an old Rhode Island farmhouse which is haunted but nobody notices until a few days later when the mother goes to some sort of paranormal activity class and learns about signs of demonic activity which happens to be taught by supernatural activity investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) who then get told about the situation and then decide to take a look at the house for themselves, but after they're hired things would get a lot worse than an ordinary person would be able to comprehend. During the many investigation scenes Lorraine finds out that there was a young woman hung by a tree by her own mother that was possessed by some demonic spirits to kill her which she then finds out will happen eventually but for reasons that I will not reveal, but things get scarier and scarier with really effective jump scares which are written at just the right times, and Wan's direction is very similar to the techniques of Alfred Hitchcock in terms of building up suspense in the movie. The performances especially from Farmiga and Wilson are very good, and mostly everything is totally realistic for a horror film. But at the same time I feel like this movie could have been a lot better despite being a near masterpiece. This is one of the best movies of the decade but not the best horror film that I've ever seen, although it is one of the very best, ranking among greats like ""Psycho"" (1960), ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991), ""Carrie"" (1976),""Poltergeist"" (1982), ""The Shining"" (1980) and many others. But compared to this movie the other Wan movie that I watched recently which was ""Saw"" (2004) this movie is nearly twice as better than that one, which is why I would highly recommend it for horror movie fans who haven't seen this movie yet."

That's what is so scary for me. The unknown. Another great thing is the the protagonists are reasonably intelligent. They don't do anything too terribly stupid in response to the things that happen around them, which was a massive relief for me. Stupid characters is a huge problem in many horror films. <br/><br/>The only real slight weakness is towards the end. It starts getting a little over the top and weird.

"ericrnolan","8","0","0","22 April 2017"," A review of ""The Conjuring"" (2013)
","I feel the same way about ""The Conjuring"" (2013) as I did about its prequel, ""Annabelle"" (2014) — it has all the earmarks of a bad movie, but it inexplicably succeeds anyway.<br/><br/>Seriously — this film has clunky exposition, cheesy dialogue and over-the-top plot developments (toward the end), not to mention a plot setup that's in questionable taste. (The movie suggests that the innocents condemned by the infamous 1692 Salem witch trials were indeed witches. This feels a bit awkward to anyone who read Arthur Miller's ""The Crucible"" in high school.) ""The Conjuring"" also plays out like a love letter to Ed and Lorraine Warren, the controversial paranormal investigators who are largely the subject of the film (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). This last offense is forgivable, I suppose — the film was made with the Warrens' blessing, and Lorraine Warren was even present as a ""consultant"" during its production.<br/><br/>Strangely, however, these flaws were barely noticeable to me when I watched it. I had a good time. ""The Conjuring"" just happens to be a decent fright flick that delivers on the scares.<br/><br/>I think James Wan's skilled directing has a lot to do with that; the film works visually. (I could name specific instances where it works especially well, but I want to avoid spoilers.)<br/><br/>The acting helped a lot too — Wilson and Farmiga are both damned good, as is Lili Taylor as the afflicted family's mother. (I've admired Taylor's acting since her long ago 1998 guest appearance on ""The X-Files,"" and she was equally good as a bad guy in 1996's ""Ransom."") Ron Livingston was also quite good in the role of the father — if you have trouble placing his face, as I did, he also played Captain Nixon in HBO's ""Band of Brothers"" (2001). He seems to have a talent for playing the likable everyman — he's great here as the somewhat feckless father, and functions well as a kind of viewer surrogate. I should also mention the young Joey King as one of the family's daughters — she played the role of a terrified child to perfection, and really raised the stakes emotionally.<br/><br/>Despite really enjoying most of the movie, some of my enthusiasm for ""The Conjuring"" flagged a bit toward the end. The denouement here includes an exorcism, and those are almost always boring. There are only so many ways that scenario can play out, and we've seen them all — and I shouldn't even need to name that certain 1973 film that did it best. Furthermore, we see our story's demon do some pretty extraordinary things, even by demon standards. It can apparently transport itself great distances (using an inanimate object as a kind of fax machine?), and can manipulate both the laws of physics and the area's wildlife. It was all a little too much for my willing suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Again, though — this was a good movie. I'd give it an 8 out of 10, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good scare."

The family was a blue collar family that found a deal on a home. They comprised two parents and five lovely young daughters. Involving children in possessions and hauntings is nothing new, it always ups the creep factor. The Conjuring involved five kids and a mother and father thereby having wealth of hosts.<br/><br/>The Conjuring wasn't all that unique but it was done really well. They had jump scares and escalating paranormal activity like every other scary movie but they made a better production of it."
"tapio_hietamaki","6","0","0","3 February 2017"," A formulaic horror movie with no surprises but a tense atmosphere
","There have been so many recent horror movies with the same basic premise - 'Sinister', 'Insidious', 'Don't Be Afraid of the Dark', 'The Haunting in Connecticut' - that it's starting to feel a bit worn. There's a normal American family troubled by some familial tensions, they move to an old country house to get a fresh start, but at night the doors and floorboards creak, there are inexplicable phenomenon, the children are scared - there's always a sweet, innocent child - and something seems to be living in the dark with them. Slowly the haunting grows more intense, furniture moves around untouched, maybe their pet dies, maybe the neighbors warn them. They find out that the house has a dark past - someone committed a horrible string of murders there and their ghost hasn't moved on. In the end the family is saved and the experience bonds them closer together.<br/><br/>So if the plot offers nothing new then it's all in the execution. 'The Conjuring' creeps on you quietly: it doesn't have gory corpses or twisted monsters, but relies on atonal strings and dark shadows. The problem is that it uses the same tropes over and over: the creaking door, the shadows in the cellar, the reflection in the mirror. Sure, they work, but they become predictable, and they're cheap tricks when you get to the bottom of things.<br/><br/>I have to admit that several scenes got me to the edge of my seat and made my breathing rapid, notably when the little girl claims to see something in the darkness standing right behind her sister, looking right at them. The movie has a tense atmosphere but when it ends, it doesn't really stay with you or fuel any nightmares. It doesn't have the horrific imagery of stronger horror movies like 'The Shining' or 'Ringu' or even 'It Follows': 'The Conjuring' is all smoke and mirrors."

I like how the occurrences start small, first the dog refusing to enter the house, then all the clocks all stop at 3:07 am, then the more serious and intense parts of the movie begin. The Conjuring is likely one of the most well made paranormal horror movies to ever have been created. I still am very shaken by the intense scenes, and specifically the jump scare when Lorraine is in the basement. If you like horror movies, or like being scared in general, this film will become one of your favourites.

"tomgillespie2002","6","0","0","23 October 2016"," Craft an old-school spooky tale before descending into CGI nonsense
","I doubt anyone could foresee the success of James Wan's The Conjuring, which, on the surface at least, looks no more remarkable than any of the gore-soaked horror bilge than swills into our cinemas every year. Released in the summer - a season hardly known for horror smash-hits - it proved that audience's desire to be scared lasts the whole year round, raking in the cash on the back of a moderate $20 million budget. It also managed to attract admiration from many critics, who found it both well-made and genuinely scary, harking back to an era when top directors took an interest in the genre and did wonders with it.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the Perron family, consisting of loving mother Carolyn (Lili Taylor), hard-working father Roger (Ron Livingston), and their five daughters, who re-locate to a dilapidated rural home in Rhode Island. While they settle quickly, it soon becomes apparent that there are other forces at work, and this supernatural presence isn't at all happy at the Perrons being in its home. Following a series of inexplicable events, Carolyn calls in paranormal investigators Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his clairvoyant wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) for help, who quickly make up their mind that this is the most p****d-off haunting they have ever witnessed.<br/><br/>Long before the likes of Most Haunted graced out TV screens, Ed and Lorraine Warren were the real celebrity ghost hunters, investigating almost every famous case of so-called demonic possession you can think of, from Amityville to the Enfield poltergeist. Many of their investigations took place in the 1970's, and Wan gives the film a very 70's aesthetic, complete with a calm, moving camera and slow zooms. 1979's The Amityville Horror is a definite influence, and there are certain moments which will bring the likes of Don't Look Now (1973) and The Omen (1976) to mind also. While The Conjuring doesn't bring anything new to the table for seasoned horror buffs, it's nice to be reminded of a time when frights were delivered by expert hands, and the genre was alive with innovation.<br/><br/>Yet while Wan's film certainly does have its moments - a camera swirl from underneath the bed to the dark corner of a bedroom is particularly memorable - it falls victim to many of the tropes that plague modern horror movies. There's the occasional reliance on a jump scare to try and keep the audience engaged, and a climax that quickly descends into CGI nonsense complete with the obligatory exorcism scene. It's rather sad, as there is a good a cast delivering strong performances and a director who certainly knows what he's doing at play here, taking the time to craft an old- fashioned spooky tale without the need for gore or sex before the ending washes away all the good work. Still, it's refreshingly old- school, which is surprising when you think that this is from the guy who kick-started the Saw franchise."

","I've been pretty weary of watching The Conjuring for a few years now. I'm not fond of horror films in general, and I wasn't particularly interested in a horror film that was dubbed ""the scariest movie of the last decade."" But as an avid film fan, I owed it to myself to give it a shot. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>A horror film in the theaters is definitely different than viewing it in the comfort of your own home in the middle of the day, but The Conjuring still had a significant impact on me. James Wan brilliantly directs this supernatural flick about a family of 7 dealing with a relentless dark presence in their newly purchased home. It wasn't even so much the demon itself or the endless number of terrifying jumps, but the fact that this was based on a true story.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play Ed and Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators who take on the case after the events escalate. I'm sure there were plenty of liberties taken, but The Conjuring is a far more grounded horror film than I expected. Wan does a nice job of building the characters out in full before we get overwhelmed with thrills in the second half. At its core, this is a character piece. And even to a certain extent, a love story between Ed and Lorraine Warren. This wasn't a horror film built around scares and gore, it was built around characters. Wan and his writers, Chad and Carey Hayes, deserve a ton of credit for that.<br/><br/>Part of the creepiness to this film comes from what you don't see. There isn't a ton of scares early on, and the stuff in camera does a lot to set the mood. But the final 30 minutes is about as thrilling of a finale in a horror film than I can remember. I felt a combination of not being able to take my eyes off the film whilst being absolutely terrified to what was on screen. It's certainly well-acted, but Wan and the Hayes brothers are absolutely the stars of this film.<br/><br/>+Thrilling finale<br/><br/>+Grounded and well thought out<br/><br/>+Takes its time with characters<br/><br/>8.7/10"

High production value, good acting and a classic story that still does not feel stale.<br/><br/>Most of the suspense is very low key - with a few stereotypical jump scares every now and then. It could have done without most of those scares as the non jump scares are nice enough on their own.<br/><br/>Of course the entire plot of the movie is kind of ridiculous. The entire house is so dark and kind of gritty that one has to wonder what the family did when they moved in. (usually i would expect a new house owner to cleanly paint the walls and install sufficient light... also to study the blueprints of the house so not to run into unexpected HUGE cellars or hidden compartments behind wardrobes.<br/><br/>However - what i do like about the Conjuring movies is that the people talk to each other and do not fall for the most prominent horror movie cliché ... that is miscommunication.<br/><br/>Also on a personal level - i love this 60s/70s look ... at least i think its that time era. It fits nicely - without all the technical gadjets. At least there is an excuse for blurred video and non HD pictures.<br/><br/>In short - i really liked it..."

","Loosely based on real events, this horror movie from 'Saw' director James Wan focuses on a house that a family begins to suspect is haunted and two paranormal researchers who they ask to perform an exorcism. The film does not hold a candle to the original 'Exorcist' movie from 1973, but it is a creepy experience all the same with Wan resorting to relatively few jump scares and precious little in the way of CGI; much of the horror is implied from the young daughters' reactions or characters screaming in the distance, with only the exorcism itself loaded with special effects. Wan also does well capturing the flavour of the 1970s with appropriate hairstyles, set decoration and language, etc. Refreshingly different as 'The Conjuring' may be from most contemporary horror movies, the basic story is still no great shakes; much of it feels like it has been done several times before with lots of run-of-the-mill haunted house elements. The novelty is meant to be the evil spirit attaches itself to its victims and haunts them rather than the house, but we rarely get a sense of this (the finale aside) as clocks stopping, strange sounds, figures in the shadows etc are all standard haunted house tropes. The cutting between the family and the paranormal specialists early on also tends to break up the tension. Whatever the case, Wan certainly crafts the movie well. His camera is often mobile, tracking and sliding eerily around the house, and there is a great scene in which one daughter peeks under the bed and the camera peeks along with her, even turning upside down."

"pextonc","9","0","0","27 June 2016"," Amazingly Portrayed Supernatural Horror... Based On A True Story!?
","James Wan emerges from the séance to bring us this spine-tingling horror, as it grips it's audiences behind their back and possesses them with the terrifying masterpiece that is 'The Conjuring'.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of the true case files of Ed and Lorraine Warren about the 'Perron' family who moved into a Rhode island farm house and began experiencing terrifying hauntings and other events, some seemingly 'friendly' (a boy named 'Manny' would watch the children's everyday lives in amusement, only to leave once made eye contact) and others who had more malevolent intentions including physically harming the family. moving objects, and also possession (Bathsheba Sherman, a former owner of the house, practicing Satanist and witch). It was not long after the family moved into the new home to realize why they were advised to ""leave the lights on at night"" by the previous owners... <br/><br/>Firstly, let's talk about the conventions of supernatural horror this movie possesses. We already understand the supernatural is something that many people would disregard as make-belief, whereas others marvel at or even treat it as a serious matter, although it can't be scientifically proved or defined as true. Unlike other horror movies, The Conjuring challenges that fact with the story-line and also the opening credits stating it's based on true events. To make this even more terrifying, the story is based around an old farm house in Rhode Island. Of course James Wan would have enjoyed taking advantage of the ol' haunted house cliché with the overly used creaking of a door, curtains fluttering in the breeze, figures at the other end of a corridor, all that lovely-horrific goodness. <br/><br/>As expected, we have those typical jump-scares and sound effects we all love from James Wan (even if you don't want to admit it). Nonetheless, It's clear to see Wan is going for something alternative or unique in this movie. Something that comes across as more malevolent or intimidating to audiences to express the theme of a 'true story' . This is shown by the haunting occurrences and events in this movie that reflect on the effects of an evil force or entity can have on such a normal, happy family. Thus making this movie so haunting and terrifying.<br/><br/>The development of the structure and story of this movie was also something I thoroughly enjoyed. Like most other horror movies, the main apparitions are revealed to us later in the story. Beginning with the subtle/confusing occurrences which opens the audience up to the wonder of what is going on, with the contrast of one big, massive plate of ""Nope!"". Whereas later in the movie we are revealed more of what is happening. With this movie however, we see that James Wan has taken this usual convention and blended it with his own unique creativity and the true story of what happened to add that extra sprinkle of terrifying unexpectedness. After watching the movie 'Insidious' before this one (which was also directed by Wan), it was clear to see the development on creating a supernatural horror to this quality, and the way Wan keeps and improves on the theme of 'fear of the unknown'.<br/><br/>As if the real life story in juxtaposition with the plot development wasn't amazing enough, everybody would agree the camera work, visual/special effects, and sound design is stunningly flawless. The way this movie manages to use these effects to drag the audiences into the movie as if they were experiencing the terrors for themselves, while also adjusting to the unique style of supernatural horror is just one reason alone enough to go and witness this movie. Although we can't just give Wan all the limelight, hats off to the other cast and crew who made it possible! <br/><br/>Although just as any movie has trapped within, I believe there are a few downsides which could have possibly been improved on for further enjoyment and added extra effectiveness. What I would have liked to have seen with my 'very own eyes' is more character development amongst the 'Perron' family. The story of this movie is based upon the hauntings and terrors which happened to these non-fictional characters. They are also a seemingly nice, happy family audiences can relate to. Although this was a clear open- door opportunity for the movie to really scare it's audiences just that little bit extra, the movie decides to take the 'Warren's' path and focus more on the paranormal investigator's character's (Ed and Lorraine) in which are also non-fictional characters. Granted I loved the way Ed and Lorraine's characters are portrayed stunningly by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga and also they're appearance in the 1968 Annabelle Higgins case, I believe with this movie running at a standard 112 minutes it possibly could have used a little more character development and focus on the Perrons for added effectiveness. <br/><br/>If you are interested in watching this movie, I would also recommend staying away from some trailers, many are demonic enough to contain big parts of the movie you need to see for yourself in the movie, not during an advertisement.<br/><br/>IN SUMMARY Overall, I believe this movie amazingly portrays in it's own originality: a terrifying and haunting true-story which will leave you on the edge of your seat (or creaking rocking- chair) until the very end. I believe also, most viewers listen to the previous owners of the house quoted from the real story to 'leave the lights on at night' after seeing this movie. Horror-lover or not, I strongly advise you to see this movie with your very own eyes. If you loved this movie, you also will not be disappointed after watching the sequel.<br/><br/>Although the trailers do not give away all of the frightening scenes (no where near), if you enjoy surprises and suspense... I would limit yourself to watching them."

Although a ghost story is maybe the most overused narrative trigger for a horror movie, Wan manages to direct a film where the usual thrill providers (doors squeaking, childish voices whispering, hand out of nowhere and everything else) are used in a stylish and well paced way, thus incredibly managing to feel as fresh as the first time you've experienced it. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson do a great job as the explorers of the supernatural, delivering some heartfelt performances. The feel of the movie is very classic: it's clear that the director tried his best to make the audience feel like watching an old-style horror flick, and that mostly works, with explicit references to ""The Exorcist"", haunted house movies in general, and even ""The Birds"" by Hitchcock. I also enjoyed the duality of the story, taking its time introducing a seemingly unrelated side-horror tale about an extremely creepy doll, Annabelle, whom apparently people keep in their houses although it gives chills just by looking at her. Anyway, ""The Conjuring"" is a rare well-crafted horror movie in these years, so it deserves a round of applause for trying to keep the genre from collapsing. I'm still bedazzled by the fact that this movie and the god-awful ""Dead Silence"" share the same director: an example of how important is the screen writing in a movie, especially a mystery one like this one."

","The quality of mainstream possession or ghost movie has been so watered down as of late its hard to have hope in this sub-genre. However, there is an exception and it comes to us by nobody other than James Wan who keeps pumping out phenomenal films. The Conjuring is undoubtedly a modern day classic that is closest in likeness to The Exorcist. While the feeling of The Exorcist is present, the writing and horrific scenes are completely different. The Conjuring uses techniques what are known nowadays as jump scares but these are successfully placed and truly scary. The pace is mixed up beautifully with well delivered character dialogue and intense chaotic scenes, which at times is completely off the charts. Check out The Conjuring if you haven't already, very much worth a purchase to a DVD collection."

","The Conjuring follows a married couple as they investigate the haunting of a family's home and try to stop whatever is doing so. <br/><br/>For the most part this movie is good, particularly the climax. That was actually pretty fantastic, and easily the best part of the movie. <br/><br/>The acting from the two main leads, Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson, was pretty good. Everyone else was good too, for the most part. Even the child actors weren't bad. <br/><br/>But that's about it. As far as scariness goes, this movie isn't. I think I was a little unsettled once, but never full-on scared. There was just lot's of slamming doors, loud noises, and a handful of predictable jump scares that weren't even startling. Everyone tells me it's got great horror, but I don't get it. It just wasn't scary. It's more of a mystery thriller than it is a horror. <br/><br/>I can see why someone would, upon seeing this movie, really like it. It's definitely a different horror movie. I can see people being pleasantly surprised at the quality. But does that make it great? No. A pleasant surprise doesn't make a great movie. A great movie makes a great movie, surprised or not. <br/><br/>Overall I can see why people would be pleasantly surprised by this movie, but I don't know why they love it as much as they do. It's just okay. Sure, there's more good than bad, but its nowhere near great. In the end I'd still recommend this movie, so long as you like horror/thrillers, but mostly so that you can form your own opinion on it."

","The Conjuring is a 2013 horror movie directed by James Wan, who has previously directed other modern masterpieces such as Insidious and Saw. The cast includes Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Ron Livingston, Lili Taylor, Joey King, and Mackenzie Foy. The review: The Conjuring is very, very scary. The Conjuring is one of the best horror movies of all time! The jump scares are right on time, causing you to jump out of your seat in fear. Don't see this if: You have a faint heart, if you think The Ring is the scariest movie ever, be ready to cry. Is this the movie you watch through your out-stretched fingers? Yes. It depends on how scared you are during horror movies. I actually could watch 95% percent of the movie the second time around. This is way scarier then Wan's Insidious franchise, and this movie is a over your horror movie standard, well not just horror movie standard, any genre of movie standard. The scares created by James Wan have just the amount of tension to make your skin crawl for hours. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson give extremely worthy, making you care about what happens to them. Joey King gives a wonderful performance as Christine, showing pure emotion for the film.<br/><br/>Grade: Scariness grade: A/ 96% (some parts of the movie are calm, which build up great character development.)

","This movie was actually very creepy and is the perfect haunted house/ghost story movie. It gave me chills, and made my date grab tight on my arm at the time we saw it. It was very believable that it took place in the 1970's. Other movies that take place in the 70's tend to over-do that like Tim Burton's Dark Shadows. When Carolyn and Roger Perron move into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island with their five daughters, they begin to have paranormal occurrences in the house from shadow people to clocks stopping to being pulled by a ghost. They hire Ed and Lorraine Warren to investigate. They soon must deal with the house and the possession of Carolyn. I would compare this film to the original 'Amityville Horror' If you want a great horror flick to actually scare you, I highly recommend THE CONJURING!!!"

","When there's something strange in your neighbourhood, who you gunna call? Real life Ghostbusters Ed and Lorraine Warren. Okay so they don't have proton packs or the Ecto-1 car but what they do have is lots of experience and the the power of Christ on their side. The Conjuring follows the Perron family haunting to which Ed and Lorraine use their ghostbusting abilities to force away the evil witch's spirit that has bonded itself to the family of 7.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of the film is creepy as hell and is probably what green lit the Annabelle spin off film. This terrifying opening which acts as a brief introduction to Annabelle makes me wish that James Wan himself made the spin off as the director has proved yet again that he is the best horror movie director of the modern era.<br/><br/>James Wan has created a truly scary film that is so thick with tension you would struggle to cut it with a knife. The films scare factor is massively down to the drawn out build up and the fear of the unknown. The escalation of events is fantastic as the film follows Ed and Lorrains three stages of possession, gradually building to full on exorcism. I especially loved the motif of Hide and Clap and the ambiguity of Rory joining will send shivers down your spine.<br/><br/>The idea of the conjuring is fantastic as the ""Based on true events"" fact brings another level of fear and authenticity that helps make film even more frightening. The cases Ed and Lorraine worked on can make for more films such as the Enfield Case that is being made helmed by James Wan also. I hope there are more Conjuring films to come directed by Wan.<br/><br/>Overall the Conjuring is a good horror film helmed by a great director. If you want proof of the films scare factor then look no further than the certificate rating as the film has been rated 15(R) for no other reason than strong horror. Its the start of what looks to be a great horror franchise and I'll be waiting to see what conjures up next."

","Directed by Horror Genre leader, James Wan, ""The Conjuring"" is one of his best efforts. Although not as original as Insidious I enjoyed this horror almost as much. It has more disturbing imagery than his earlier hit, and a more traditional story. Indeed the latter parts of this movie are akin to the decades old ""Exorcist"" but somewhat less religious overall. While the Exorcist involved priests heavily, ""The Conjuring"" stresses the ghost-hunters are less religious. There are a lot of good performances and creeping going on. The back story is convincing and eerie enough. There is less gore and more emphasis on creeps. The core cast do very well."

","The purpose of this sort of film is to set goose bumps along your arms and make you jump and to that end the director has done a damned good job. My wife and I jumped several times during the movie even though we knew something was about to happen and numerous times I had chills running down my arms. This is of course all down to the effective use of music and sound effects together with the images, without them you probably wouldn't react because there is nothing here that you haven't seen before. It is just very well combined and presented. The story is the classic haunted house tale of a new family being tormented by an evil entity and the good guys that come to the rescue and is allegedly based on a true story. I noticed that some reviewers have referred to an interview with one of the daughters of the family but to counterbalance that the current owners of the house say it is all baloney and nothing has or does happen there. But there again they would say that wouldn't they? This is a great movie to give yourself and some friends a thrill at Halloween and there is no blood and gore which is a plus but don't watch it on your own if you are of a nervous disposition."

But on the other hand, almost all horror movies are around haunted houses and families in them. And children are always a plus to add to horror!<br/><br/>I think the acting is really good. Maybe one of the reasons I liked the movie. But it is not quite scary to me. As I said, Sinister was the one that really scared me and I expected the same from this movie, but it failed to do so.<br/><br/>I was hesitant between 7 or 8 but will go with eight as it is quite good horror movie."

","Presenting a story based on factual events, this movie did enough justice in dramatizing both the story and the horror aspects. What I really like about this horror, which is quite unusual for me since I don't really dig into horrors, is that the movie doesn't glorify the devil portrayed in it like other horrors do. The main proponent of that is that the demon doesn't win at the end. This movie falls into the exorcism sub genre of horrors, but it feels like none of the same, because it actually shows that the power of God is the thing that kicks out the demon from possession, not the Latin liturgies or the holy relics. Like this movie showed us, the demon or devil doesn't have to win on the end for the movie to have a sequel. The acting overall is decently good. Patrick Wilson seems to be finding a new home as a horror actor after mediocre roles in action and romances. Vera Farmiga played out her clairvoyant role well enough to give the ability enough realism."

","'The Conjuring' is virtually an autobiographical tale of Ed and Lorraine Warren's most terrifying and memorable case. This film is definitely worth an R-rating, but for nothing too out of context. It's not a bloodbath, no one has sex, there's not even severe language. But the jump scenes by themselves are enough to give it R, and scare grown men out of their skin and back into it! This film is definitely worth its rating, but it's one of the best horror movies in the past 20 years. The power behind the story is one that will never be forgotten.

"stephaniegorissen","9","0","0","13 January 2015"," Excellent movie that holds your attention throughout the entire movie.
","The Conjuring is a must see movie if you are fan of horror movies. The Conjuring released some profoundly effective trailers before the actual movie was released. This drew a lot of attention to this haunted house spook fest. And with good reason, since it's one of the best horror movies of the last decade. Plus, it's based on a true story.<br/><br/>The movie was written by Chad and Carey Hayes. These writers worked on quite some other blockbuster horror movies as well, such as House of Wax and The Reaping. James Wan directs the movie and is one of the most notable directors in the current horror genre. He directed the Saw series and Insidious movies.<br/><br/>The Conjuring tells the story about Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) along with their five daughters, who've just moved into the big house. They think they've found the house of their dreams, but unfortunately for them, this is not the case. There is something wrong with the house. It starts with the dog refusing to go into the house. Later on they start to hear strange inexplicable noises and doors start to move on their own. Eventually Carolyn starts to get bruises on her body. They then decide it's time to ask the help of Ed and Lorrain Warren.<br/><br/>Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorrain Warren (Vera Farmiga) are two paranormal investigators. They cross through the country with their stories about different kinds of haunted houses. Carolyn and Roger ask them for help because they think they are being terrorized by a dark and evil spirit. Ed and Lorrain decide to take on the case and they then go to the house to investigate what's going on. It becomes clear that there's something very wrong with the house and that the people living there are in danger. They put together a team to collect evidence so they can ask the church's permission to perform an exorcism. <br/><br/>The Conjuring is a classic horror movie in every aspect. Although the story is not very original (think about the aspects: haunted house, evil spirit that tries to hurt the people living in the house etc.) it still maintains to hold your attention throughout the entire movie. It is a perfect combination of suspense and mystery, since you never know what to expect in the next scene. The movie has a lot of jump scares that catch you when you least expect them. The movie contains a lot of banging on walls, slamming doors, people that get thrown in the air and there's a lot of Latin involved. All in all a good mixture of classic horror aspects without turning it into a monotonous story. <br/><br/>This movie is a must see if you're a horror fanatic like me. I watched it in the cinema and I got goose bumps all over my body while watching this movie. There were a few scenes that made me shiver and made me hold my breath, scared of what was going to happen next. The amazing acting of the actors and the incredibly creepy set makes you feel like you're a part of the movie. It makes you kind of scared, since I was scared shitless throughout the entire movie.<br/><br/>This movie is in my list of best horror movies I've ever watched, along with movies like Sinister, Insidious and The Amityville Horror. The movie gets you thinking about life after death. It makes you wonder if spirits, good or bad, exist or not. Whether this is true or not, The Conjuring is a magnificent movie that deserves a great rating, therefore I give this movie a 9 out of 10. Simply brilliant!"
"alizaid96669","10","0","0","11 January 2015"," The resemblance to The Amityville Horror book
","A good horror movie to come across in a while. I think the Bible, and all religions in general, are resourceful goldmines for horror movie makers. This movie has a lot of resemblance to The Amityville Horror book (1977) by the late Jay Anson. No wonder, as both Lorraine and Ed Warren had participated in the investigation of that (presumably) haunted house back in 1976.<br/><br/>The paranormal events that the authors of the two movies/books claim to be based on true stories could happen. However, to claim that the evil presences respond 'only' to religious rites and symbols (especially of the three monotheists: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism) is a bit far- fetched.<br/><br/>There are billions of polytheists, pagans and others who have their own ways to deal with such phenomena. For them emphasizing the effectiveness of exorcism rites of the monotheists in books and movies are viewed as cheap propaganda.<br/><br/>Non-believers, too, reject the phenomena and the religious rites and consider the whole thing laughable.<br/><br/>Still I find this movie scarier and more entertaining than the Amityville movie. And as a horror movie fan I give it 10/10. Don't miss it."

This will make your neck hairs stand on end and leave you calling for both mommy and mercy. James Wan proves that you can still make good horror if you do it well.

","Hands down this was great! Just great! It couldn't be better. Of course there was some negligible issues like the voice of the demon/child or whatever you wish to call it. It was plain and hasty, it could be slower with more depth. Also the supposed to be 16mm footage was better to be filmed with real 16mm Bolex or something for authentic look and grain instead it was in HD and looked like a footage from a modern camcorder. The thing is that despite near perfect production, director failed to take us back to year 1971 but the movie was so great that these things are negligible. I would say 8/10 because of mentioned deficiencies and also because I've seen better movies like ""The Changeling (1980)"". Also there is something good to mention. I've seen lots of none christians complained about the movie based on what they call ""Christian Nonsense"". Well we can debate it forever but the fact is that the movie is primarily intended for United States and western hemisphere were the majority of people are church going christians. I'm certain if it was made in East Asia or a middle eastern country, they would have come to some sort of explanation based on their respected religion as what we saw in movies like Kwaidan (1964).

","After finding a family that has been attacked by a demonic entity, a team of paranormal researchers tries to help them rid their house of the demons only for a more dangerous battle to befall them.<br/><br/>This turned out to be quite the enjoyable and highly entertaining effort without a lot really wrong with it. One of the biggest issues with this here is the rather irritating way this one resorts to loud jump-scenes to constitute it's scares without deviating from this tactic throughout the film, really making it seem like there's only so many different tricks it can utilize before it runs out. The continuing tactics of the ghost popping up in windows or mirrors behind people makes for a rather aggravating series of moves when this is what's continuously utilized here and it makes for a pretty rough time in the first half here getting this going while also managing to stretch out the run-time a little bit more than it really needed to be. Beyond those, though, there's a lot to like within this one as it really manages to be quite enjoyable. One of its' better efforts is the fact that this one really manages to get the feel of warranted investigation into bringing the investigators in with the full build-up of this one generating enough worthwhile actions to make for a believable trip to the experts. From the children's games played early on to the discovery of the left-over artifacts and then the running storyline about the shadows running around and the bodily injuries, there's certainly some rather skillfully-done actions that manage to bring in the team using worthwhile manners and it only gets more fun from there. The last half is filled with all sorts of fantastic sequences from the crawlspace investigation to the attack on the daughter in the living room and the chasing around the possessed member in the basement which leads into the exorcism attempt that gets quite fun. Its' all fast-paced, exciting and just seems dangerous enough that you don't know if that's what's going to happen next or if there's going to be something even more dangerous to come and that unexpected nature becomes one of its greatest attributes. It's also quite nice in here to really have the backstory present in here which manages to be quite dark and chilling, setting the mood for the actions to come as well as being designed to exploit the supernatural elements it plays with here. Overall, this one was quite a bit of fun despite it's few flaws.<br/><br/>Rated R: Violence, Language and continuous children-in-jeopardy."

","Summary: The Conjuring is a memorable, well acted and genuinely frightening horror film. 90/100 (A-)<br/><br/>The Conjuring is a horror film directed by James Wan and it was my most anticipated horror movie of 2013. Moving on, the opening scene is spooky, since here you can behold the stunning camera work; this little scene is about a possessed doll called Annabelle. This scene keeps the suspense and the scariness. There are two stories in the movie; the first one is about Lorraine and Ed Warren, they are two paranormal investigators, both have a little daughter and they live in a nice house. Then, there's the other story about a likable family who has experienced some paranormal events in their new home. It doesn't matter how cliché it sounds, this is a terrific horror film.<br/><br/>After the first 30 minutes or so, there are the first scares, all of them are very effective, unexpected and well executed. Even though I didn't jump out of my seat (maybe because jump-scares are not effective in me and some of the scares were in the trailer) I have to admit that the film freaked me out so much, it boasts some extremely violent sequences and it was so damn thrilling at several moments. A few scares were pretty familiar and it's true that it doesn't offer something new to the horror genre, but it has enough creativity and originality to succeed. In addition, it is very similar in tone to 'The Woman in Black', both have a well handled suspense and an atmospheric setting.<br/><br/>The performances were great, even the young cast was awesome. The most believable character in the film was Christine (performed by Joey King), this girl was excellent. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were good as always, Vera's character ""Lorraine"" was a bit surreal but her stunning performance made me believe in all of what she said. Also, Lili Taylor did an excellent job with her role throughout the film, she was amazing, especially in the chilling final act. Moving on, the special effects were quite realistic and so well done. In spite of being a low budget film, it didn't use too much CGI, maybe just in a couple scenes, but everything looks great anyway.<br/><br/>Its final act has some flaws, the exorcism scene has its ups and downs. However, I still liked it, this whole sequence is truly violent, a bit bloody and creepy. The acting was awesome here, Lili Taylor is such a great actress and she really looked like a possessed woman. I just can't believe that Wan directed this flick, most of his previous movies are quite average; but this one, it's a total blast. The Conjuring is an extremely well done horror film that has an impressive camera work, a great cast and lots of memorable scares. It definitely earns its R rating because it's very gruesome and evil at times. It's my favorite horror film of 2013. Oh, and please don't watch the trailer, it's a huge spoiler. (A-)"

","The plot, supposedly based upon a true story, was very believable. It reminded me of the Exorcist and Amityville Horror except with a new cast of characters. I thought the whole cast, especially the two ghost hunters played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, did an excellent job. As in all horror genre movies, I sometimes wondered why the homeowners didn't take more swift, decisive action immediately. And I never understand why people walk right into the danger (basement) rather than try to get help, or at least get better lighting. Still an excellent movie. I can't wait to see the sequel, and hopefully the Annabelle doll will be used more for scarier effects."

","No human soul is a bad soul. They might touch you or move things, but won't physically harm you, especially if it is a soul of family or relatives. Sometimes people get so scared, they actually think souls want to harm them. Entities is not souls and yes, they do cause a lot of mess from time to time. They do not live in houses normally, they only come if the portal get's open. Souls do not possess human bodies, demons could, but these are not human souls either. Religion has nothing to do with possession, it doesn't protect human from that in any way. There are special rituals that are performed during exorcism ritual, but these has nothing to do with Christianity. Places can be haunted, people can be cursed and people can die, but not from the direct hand of the dead ones, like it is shown in this movie. They would die from diseases, insanity, etc. So when you actually know how things work in reality, watching film like that makes you laugh, because of how absurd some scenes are. And it is supposed to be a horror film, not a comedy. I wish for once they could actually show more reality and not just various nonsense purely to entertain viewers. Plus many scenes are just like in other similar movies (flying, vomiting..) so it is very disappointing, that director or writer couldn't come up with something fresh. P.s. Proper mediums would see and be able to communicate with the dead ones and be able to see why strange things happen in house. You don't have to dig archives to find out what is what, if you really have the ability to see more than the rest of the people. In this film Warrens look like an absolute amateurs, hope they weren't in reality. The only film that is decent in terms of esoteric science is The Skeleton Key."

","I find that horror movies are mostly not effective at scaring me. This was very different than traditional horrors that rely on either gore and blood or jump scares. This movie moreso relied on atmosphere and the creepy setting. Since most of the movie takes place in one house, the director uses many interesting shots and camera movements to keep the setting engaging. The actors all portray their characters effectively, with only Livingston looking out of place. This may be due to me only seeing him as his Office Space character forever. As with most horrors, I feel that the ending is a bit weak since we actually see the main villain directly. Regardless, this is an excellent horror movie that is better than another recent horror movie, Sinister, by not having the cheap jumpscares. Minor nitpicks would be that the doll never really scared me, and the beginning seems comedic and out of place with everything else. Also why have a museum of evil in a house with a young daughter?"

","After seeing this movie I thought for three days to see the devil behind me. After seeing this movie I did not go to sleep for 24 hours, because I did not want to go upstairs. Thinking the ghost was living upstairs in my house. The Exorcist was splendid in its horror. But this movie gives you much more scare. The story is very believable and the actors playing their role very well. If you are alone and have a weak heart, do not watch this movie, because you will die of a heart attack. If you love ghosts, horror and all stuff we cannot explain. see this movie. Do not let watch your children the movie, because they will have bad dreams for the rest of their live.

Everything that will happen is spelt out for you far in advance. <br/><br/>It was technically well-made, i suppose.

"sohansurag","6","0","0","24 December 2013"," A severely over-rated disappointment,
","James Wan once again returns to his Horror roots directing back to back horror movies with The Conjuring closely followed by Insidious Chapter 2. 2011′s Insidious was undeniably one of the biggest horror movies of the year and I absolutely enjoyed it . Even to the point that I started recommending it to people. Insidious had atmospheric horror, and it had almost everything going for it, everything except a lackluster ending which it had to include for an obvious sequel. Nonetheless James Wan knows his movies; be it Saw, Dead Silence or Death Sentence, entertainment is guaranteed. His latest offering The Conjuring is nothing but a haunted house movie albeit following the 'old wine new bottle' routine. If you are horror movie fan you'll instantly feel in familiar territory here. We've had more than a handful of them, the best being The Amityville Horror, The Haunting, The Shining, Poltergeist, the list goes on. So what's new here? Actually nothing, as soon as the middle-class family moves into their new house, you know things are gonna get awry. It starts off with a very slow first act and they dump all the noisy, in-your-face stuff towards the finale as the demons and violent spirits takes a toll. I'd been hearing a lot of positive reviews about this one, some even quoting that its one of the scariest movies ever to hit the screen or even that the visuals will be stuck in your head making you paranoid with every creak you hear in your house post-watching this. I can't say the same though, yes it did give me jolts and ample amounts of anxiety but the visuals just didn't have any effect on me. I forgot about it as soon as I came outta the theater. There are a lot of memorable scenes though made possible with some fantastic camera work. I suppose I had my expectations way too high reading those rave reviews which made my experience so .so yeah even this one could be hampering your experience should you choose to watch the movie. The plot-direction is one among the high points here, balancing the events from both families, The Perrons who are the victims of the haunting and The Warrens who are the ghost hunters. Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston as the Perrons did convincing acting. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed Warren delivered splendid performances. Vera, being my favorite from The Orphan and loads of other movies, was no less impressive here. The kids were another addition to the brilliant casting, there were five of them and it seemed too much of a crowd initially but the ones who were terrified victims and dragged to the end did an astounding job, among them Joey King who played a younger version of Talia in The Dark Knight Rises gave a noteworthy performance here as Christine. Ah well now the about the unholy beings, they were terrifying indeed, thanks to good makeup and less-screen time. James Wan did go for the right amount of 'the less you see the more you'll be scared' formula and it did do wonders. There was this particularly awesome scene which involves one perched atop a cupboard. Clearly haunted house horror genre aren't my cup of tea unless its another Cabin in The Woods which had tons of novelty (yet again I wouldn't call it scary). I was more scared of twitchy otherworldly beings like Mama, Samara from The Ring or the ones from The Grudge but for others though, The Conjuring might just satiate their terrifying needs as evident from the pretty lady behind me who kept gasping more than needed. The Conjuring is a well directed, brilliantly acted horror movie with mild scares that could be enjoyed the same at home with a good pair of headphones. As for me I'm gonna wait for Insidious Chapter 2 and see if its got some real scares."

What a let down it was, then, when I actually saw the film.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" does have some satisfyingly creepy moments, especially in its first half hour when we start to get only inklings of something evil lurking in a haunted house. But director James Wan, whose claim to fame is launching the ""Saw"" franchise, is far too literal and gives his audience far too little credit for having imaginations to sustain that creepiness across the length of the entire film. Instead, he decides to go all out, resorting to shock scares, special effects and histrionics, resulting in a climax that's more chaotic than it is scary. An exorcism that comprises most of the film's final moments is especially silly.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga, as a paranormal expert, stands out as the film's best asset, using her considerable talents as an actress to make far more out of a stock horror movie role than the film probably deserves.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

Marketing always uses the term ""scariest film ever made"" or ""scariest film of the year"" and yet again, advertising has made this film bigger than it really is.

"The_Dead_See","5","3","9","20 July 2013"," And the worst offender for cheap jump scares award goes to...
","The Conjuring has solidified my theory on the films of James Wan - he makes movies aimed squarely at teenagers. I can't knock him for that, it's a pretty solid success strategy and it makes perfect sense that they've slated him as the director for Fast and Furious 7 - an entire franchise aimed at teenagers. <br/><br/>I can't help but think it's a shame though, because the guy does have talent. You can see glimpses of it shining through the cheap jump scares that litter every frame of The Conjuring. He clearly knows how to use his framing in unique and interesting ways, he clearly knows his history of cinematic trends, and he's got a Spielbergian knack for throwing in much needed light moments. It's like he wants to make a scary movie for adults - one with an actual story and atmosphere - and he knows he's got the ability to do it, but either he's too afraid to take the risk of it failing at the box office due to teenage attention deficit, or pressure from higher-ups is reigning him in. <br/><br/>The Conjuring isn't a bad ghost movie, it's just not the kind of ghost movie I can get into personally. I need more to chew on than gimmickry or my attention starts to wander, and by the tenth time I'd watched someone in a night gown creep anxiously towards a strange noise, boy was it wandering. <br/><br/>Lili Taylor and Vera Farmiga are very good in their roles and I would say it's perfect for something to watch with a group of talkative friends and giggle at the jumps; but if you want something to engage you on an individual basis with a story or character development, this is about as far away as you can get. Those of us who want a thickening tension, slowly revealingly backstory or sense of progress in the plot will have to go back to watching movies like The Changeling, Session 9, The Others, or Burnt Offerings instead. Maybe the next ghost movie James Wan makes, he'll be a little braver and make one for us instead of the kids."
"radiobuzz","2","2","5","12 February 2014"," Conjuring the cheese
","In my 8 years of being an IMDb member I never wrote a review, even less a rant. However after watching The Conjuring I was compelled to express why I disliked it so much. It's pretty bad as a viewer when a horror movie isn't able to bring you into its world because it makes all the twists and scares feel ineffective. There are several reasons why I felt that way while watching this, even though I've been wanting to see it for some time now.<br/><br/>One of its main problems is the abuse of the constant build-ups that stretch out for long minutes and lead absolutely nowhere. These come one after the other and make up a big part of the movie's runtime. It's very hard to make a climatic build up that actually stands out, and this movie doesn't get it right even once.<br/><br/>When the movie is not building up pointless scenes, it throws you a scene involving the one dimensional ghostbusters who have a traumatic past experience which is terribly uninteresting. The acting for those characters are pretty bad, but that's in part for the complete emptiness of the lines which written to have a very specific meaning, mostly to show you how good and honest they are.<br/><br/>It's kind of amazing to me how many critics have hyped up a movie like this while giving sh*t to a director such as Shyamalan, which even at his worst can display a much better handle of tension in one simple shot than this movie can throughout its entire length. I don't mind people liking this, however if you are looking for a horror movie capable of being intriguing in the traditional way, don't be fooled by the marketing: The Conjuring isn't able to find one single reason to stand out from the mud."
"sddavis63","3","2","5","3 January 2014"," Our House Gave It A Split Decision
","""The Conjuring"" certainly caused a split in our household! My wife loved it. She thought it was great. I, on the other hand, struggled just to stay awake (and I lost that battle at least twice.) The split was interesting, because based on the genre, this was the sort of movie that should have caused the very opposite reactions.<br/><br/>To be frank, every movie that claims to be based on true events loses a couple of points with me right off the top and has to struggle to get those points back. The Conjuring did not get them back. Yes, I know that the real life Andrea Perron (one of the daughters) says that the story is pretty accurate, but she frankly also has a vested interest in getting people interested, being herself a writer. So, take it with a grain of salt.<br/><br/>The basic story revolves around the Perron family, who buy an old house that has quite a dark and secret past - and the past becomes the present when the Perrons move in. Overwhelmed by what they experience in the house, they turn to Ed and Lorraine Warren - a demonologist and clairvoyant. The Warrens are real, and are themselves controversial, with a lot of people questioning their reliability. I can't honestly say that I found anything here that raised this above any other haunted house movie, mind you. It has the requisite ""jump"" moments, but nothing out of the ordinary for the genre. I really wasn't impressed with the performances and the story failed completely to draw me in.<br/><br/>My wife, however, loved it. In deference to her good taste (she married me, after all) I'll go a little higher than I was planning to go. (3/10)"
"ivulienka","5","2","5","30 December 2013"," One disappointment after another
","First of all, I was really looking forward to see this movie, even though it has such a overused topic as haunted house surely is. But I assumed that James Wan would bring something original to it, as he always does. Maybe I should have just watch the trailer, it gives away the plot and all of the good scares anyway.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't bring anything new to the haunted house horror movies subject. We can see everything that has already been done a billion times in all the other films. Family buys a cheap house with unsure history, check. Pet senses there is something wrong with it and then dies from an unsolved cause, check. Child has an imaginary, most possible a ghost friend, that nobody else can see, check. Clocks stop at exact same time every night, check. Family discovers an attic full of some old and creepy stuff, check.<br/><br/>OK, then some strange things begin to happen all over the house, but the family doesn't intend to leave the house. Only one who eventually leaves is the father who lets defenseless women to their destiny.<br/><br/>The major problem of this movie is, in my opinion, that they build up a tension that isn't followed by anything. You can hear strange noises and doors opening by itself all the time, but you never see a ghost or demon. Then, when they finally show you one it's in the cheap jump scare. Also you don't feel like they're facing a real danger when nobody is killed or even injured although there are some pretty dangerous situations.<br/><br/>All in all, 5/10, it's a watchable movie with decent acting and really good camera work, but nothing breath taking."

","It feels bad in a way to criticise this film because it is trying so hard to be good.

Yes, there are crashes and jumps that startle, but one is never drawn in deeper.<br/><br/>It's a pity because there are a couple of good performances (Lili Taylor stands out) and it's certainly photographed well. I think it is the direction that is a bit off. It feels more like a paint-by-numbers approach to the genre than someone who is genuinely conveying what makes him personally afraid. (I don't think I've ever seen a film with more people walking backwards into the open frame behind them.) <br/><br/>So does it work for a Saturday night popcorn-jumper with the right audience? Sure.

","What can I say about a movie that accurately captures 1971 and also has characters we care about. It's magic. And it's beautiful film making with a nice blend of atmospheric and classic horror . Even if you are not a believer in the paranormal, this trivial belief should not deter you from enjoying and experiencing the terror.<br/><br/>Everyone here is perfectly cast. I loved the family, the girls, The Warrens and the parents. They all seemed so perfectly suited for their roles. I even appreciated Wan's usage of 1960's and 70's lingo like ""far out"" and ""groovy"". Although it wasn't germane to the story, he does it just to amuse us. What warms my heart is to see people in movies being genuine and earnest with each other. In an age where we see duplicity, backbiting, and rudeness as the norm, The Conjuring uses their characters with sincerity. Perhaps this is indicative of the period. This is a beautiful film to watch using stunning settings with very chronologically accurate designs and set pieces. The fashion in clothing and choice of automobiles are spot on accurate as well. It's nice to see a director taking care of a movie he cares so much about that we is devoted to expressing accuracy and truth."

","I went into this movie with high hopes - I mean, an 85% from Rotten Tomatoes for a horror movie is just... wow.<br/><br/>From the get-go it's eerie. Throughout the movie, the pace often changes and the mood sweeps back and forth (I mean, you can't be having a freaking happy montage in the middle of a horror movie, it kills the mood). For the most part, this movie delivers the creeps and the subtle use of horror is fantastic. It really draws off of the older style of horror movies. I loved a lot of what this movie had to offer; however, the sloppy effects, poor makeup, and downright useless scenarios really took a toll.<br/><br/>The characters were pretty well-made. For once, there wasn't really a dumb character, but having five little girls in one family, plus one, is a bit over-the-top. I understand it's a big family, but they made the girls an afterimage in light of the more rounded adults. There were two characters who really didn't need to be in this movie - one a cop (who is there to deliver a few punchlines, but pretty useless) and the other the ghost of a maid who appears for maybe 5 seconds before never even being seen or mentioned again. Other than that, there are a couple lame performances that are hit and miss through the film.<br/><br/>A few of the effects are sloppy, including the cuts in the scenes with the montage and objects being thrown (a chair looks completely CGI, if I'm wrong, then it looks really bad regardless). The ghosts didn't really do it for me either. Ghosts in photographs looked great, costumes were great, and the detail on limbs were pretty decent, but seeing the faces of the ghosts in person looked like cheap, Halloween makeup.<br/><br/>I will say that the exorcism scene was one of the best exorcism scenes in cinema history that I've ever seen (I'd give The Exorcism a run for it's money). If anything, take that scene from the movie as it's best moment.<br/><br/>I understand that people are latching on to new horror movies, hoping for a horror genre comeback, but talking up this movie isn't the way to go about it. This obviously isn't perfect and doesn't deserve an 8/10. Maybe a 7, if you're being nice. I respect the performers, writers, the director, and producers, and horror is my favorite genre, but I have my opinions as well. I want the horror genre to succeed, and this movie is definitely a step closer to what we need.

I went and saw this with a friend and we laughed throughout the movie. Don't get me wrong, the acting and special effects and everything else in this movie is very well done, but the story has been done too many times before. A family moves into a new house, weird stuff happens, and they call a demonologist up to try to fix their problem. It is just so predictable, and when you can see something coming it doesn't scare you as much as it could have if it had been a surprise. All in all I am very disappointed, I don't scare easily at the movies and I was really hoping for a good one out of this one but I just didn't get it. I'm just waiting for Hollywood to get off of this demonologist/exorcism train and come up with something else to scare me with."

","The Conjuring (2013)<br/><br/>Very very well made and ""convincing"" as much as these far-fetched events can convince. The acting and filming (including some cool camera-work) are first rate, really good. And so the direction, under James Wan, deserves a lot of credit.<br/><br/>What this movie lacks, though, is plain old originality. Somehow you might not mind, since it sucks you in fast and makes it interesting all through. But there are many movies (many) that deal with similar ideas, even with a kind of pseudo-documentary aspect built in, and with more creative aspects, too.<br/><br/>The classic influences here are pretty well laid out. ""The Exorcist"" which was shot and released during the same period this movie was set is a clear parallel. And for its own originality, and for a more disturbing aspect as well as a somewhat more ""grand"" and oddly lyrical take on the ideas, that first version outclasses this one. (If you haven't seen it recently, give it a look before you doubt.) Then there are little hints of lots of other movies, various haunted house films of course, and even a nod to ""The Birds"" which you'll see several times.<br/><br/>The movie that this owes maybe too much to is the rather well done recent ""The Awakening"" set in a British boarding school. It has an all too similar set of strategies, with cameras and remote devices meant to catch the spirits in a tangible way. In some ways that was a better movie, with a really terrific leading women, but this one has some extra layers of possession and exorcism that give it an over-the-top craziness by the end.<br/><br/>What really floats this boat (""The Conjuring"") for two hours is the convincing core cast playing things in a real, unsensational way (as much as you can when you're possessed and flying through the air). And here I mean mostly the two woman and the husband of the demonologist couple. (The father of the family is a bit bland.) And then there's the camera itself, which almost becomes another character the way it moves and inhabits (possesses?) some of the scenes. The photography ought to be up for some award nominations in a few months.<br/><br/>You'll find this all harrowing stuff if you let it. It could have pushed some new boundaries, for sure, and maybe avoided some implausible aspects (people might not fall through a crumbing building with only a tiny scratch). But hey, then it wouldn't be supernatural, would it? A great summer escape movie."

Trust me I did and it wasn't the greatest idea. Lol! So yeah in my opinion this was THE BEST horror movie ever made! Go and see it!:)"

","This film is recommended.<br/><br/>Who doesn't like a good scary ghost story now and then? One that delivers goosebumps or makes us jump with every dreaded bump in the night. The Conjuring miraculously reappears from that old fashion haunted house movie staple of the past before disappearing into the haze of formulaic set-ups updated for today's movie-going audiences. The film toys with our fears of the unknown, wisely keeps the horror hidden for our own imaginations to work overtime, and plays with our own insecurities and foibles.<br/><br/>The obvious story may sound all so familiar, but the filmmaking isn't. James Wan skillfully directs this supernatural horror film which (of course) is based on supposedly true events. The film relies heavily on our past experiences as moviegoers as it successfully mixes our cinematic memories of Poltergeist, The Haunting, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, Child's Play and other films of this genre with more recent offerings like The Blair Witch Project, Insidious, and the Paranormal Activity series. (By the way, Wan directed Insidious so he's had some practice with eerie sound effects and quick edits. He also directed Saw but he shrewdly downplays any gore and sex with this outing. It's R-rating is a bit surprising as most of the violence is suggestive and not overt.) Special kudos also go out to Wan's long-time collaborator and cinematographer John R. Leonetti for his atmospheric imagery and powerful use of lighting and shadows.<br/><br/>The plot: It's 1971. Carolyn and Roger Perrone (Lilli Palmer and Ron Livingston) are the proud parents of five wonderful daughters and a 17th century farmhouse listed at a ridiculously low price. Needless to say the Perrone clan is one excited and happy family until mysterious goings-on go on. Terrorized by evil forces, The Perrones are unable to leave due to economic hardships (an apt touch with today's housing market woes). Who they gonna call? Help is soon on the way in the form of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson), seekers of the paranormal. These ghost-hunters believe the family's story and will help rid the house of demons and bad spirits.<br/><br/>Written by Chad and Carey Hayes, The Conjuring avoids most of the pitfalls of so many previous horror tales. The film tries to remain credible by having its characters make logical choices for the most part and still create some tension and suspense before descending into full supernatural hyperbole. The film also tries to keep a serious tone throughout all the strange occurrences, casting credence wherever it can. The Conjuring purports to be based on actual activities documented in a case study by the real-life Warrens, although the fanciful prologue never quite gels with the rest of the film and the sound effects are all too obvious. <br/><br/>However, the strong cast, especially Wilson and Farmiga as the paranormal investigators, help to elevate the familiar story and bring with them an air of believability. The setting, with its 70's pop score and details in its art direction, creates a period flavor that lends an authenticity and legitimizes the reality of the ghostly activity that propagated during that era.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is an extremely well-made supernatural ghost story that more than delivers the thrills and chills one expects from this genre. The filmmakers are indeed completely possessed, fortunately, with the right amount of talent and enough style to conjure up a nifty little tale of horror that today's moviegoers can truly enjoy.

","The house in ""The Conjuring"" has issues. As in, don't-look-under-the- bed-and NEVER-go-down-into-the-basement, issues. Not in a long time has a movie come out that had me cover my eyes and dread the night ( OR daytime, for that matter). I'm a scary movie veteran. At 48-years old, I have seen them all. But, for those of you too young to remember, ""The Exorcist"", and, ""The Shining"", movies that for their time, terrified audiences across the nation, this movie can rightfully take its place right up there along side them. If you're expecting a bloodbath-gore- fest, this movie is not for you. This is the real deal. There are ghosts. There are, ""other things"". There are bumps in the night, ( MANY). And, there is a family that takes us right along with them into long dark days and nights.This is a haunted house.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, something a lot of movie studios use as clever marketing ploys to get you into their movies, what sets this apart is that this family really exists and their claims of being brutally terrorized for TEN, yes you read that right, TEN-YEARS,(between you and me, I would have been OUT of there after the first incident) not by Jason or Michael Meyers chasing them with machetes, but doors creaking open by themselves ( who among us hasn't experienced that and just pushed it off as ""the wind""?) and sounds of someone walking upstairs when you know no one is home but you. Believe me, that is TAME compared to what comes after. <br/><br/>Carolyn and Roger Perron, and their 5 daughters, move into a remote farmhouse that has a lot of bad mojo surrounding it. Someone claims that houses don't have memories? Right. This one does: quite a few. Within a day, these memories become reality. Unable to cope with the escalating horrors that ensue, they bring in, Lorraine and Ed Warren, real-life paranormal experts that have seen it all, until now. What this family is desperate for is some sense of understanding and just plain help. What happens from then on is all-Hell breaking loose. The reason behind why the doors slam and bad smells wake them up at night, is uncovered almost immediately. Believe me, this doesn't bring anyone, including you, any relief. This house and it's ""inhabitants"" are mad, REALLY MAD. Hang on to your seats people, you're in for a ride.<br/><br/>Why would I like a movie that truly frightened me and had me, a mom of 3, sleeping with a night light on and my feet covered up, (you'll never sleep with them any other way after this)? Well for those of us who believe, and a huge population of the world does, it's a fact that in the history of this world, there have been incidents that show us that life doesn't end at the grave and what can come up out of that isn't always warm and fuzzy. This isn't your deceased grandmother leaving you a sign that she loves you and is waiting for you on the other side. Do your homework. If you search right, you can find many credible examples of real-life haunting's from all over the world and the people who survived them, and unfortunately, those who didn't. I won't tell you who in this family survived to tell the tale, lets just say I'm glad I wasn't a part of it.<br/><br/>This was the best $11.50 I have spent in years. <br/><br/>And when that door creaks open and you blame the wind? Think again."

","Finally a scary film worth watching...oh wait...there hasn't been a scary movie since ""Mama"" this year. I can hear Paula Cole singing ""Where have all the scary movies gone?"" Anyway if you wanna get yourself jumping from your seat, watch the fright-fest ""The Conjuring"". <br/><br/>Based on the True Files of Ben and Lorraine Warren who were the first Parapsychologists in the field. The film showcases the horrifying case of the Annabelle Doll incident to the disturbing events at the Perron Family's Farmhouse in Long Island. I did my homework on the history of the Warrens before watching the movie and I have to say that James Wan did a marvelous job capturing the point of view of the Perron Family and what they went through when they moved into their new house and then what Lorraine Warren saw while she and her husband investigated the chilling events. <br/><br/>Vera does it again! After playing the cray cray mother of Norman Bates in ""Bates Motel"", Verga Farmiga does a 180 and portrays a loving mother with a determination to help others in their crisis. She gets Lorraine down to the detail after seeing the real Lorraine in interviews. Pretty much anything Patrick Wilson is in is awesome! Lili Taylor and Rob Livingston were believable as the Perrons who portrayed the fear and courage to fight against the negative forces in the house. But the Perron Daughters really delivered the believable scares the girls really went through.<br/><br/>There are creepy moments in the movie that will linger in your mind after viewing. You won't see old dolls the same way again. Plus you won't want to go down in the basement by yourself...unless you live in Florida. Worse of all, if a kid hands you a toy box and says that once the music stops playing, you'll see a boy standing behind you, dang it don't even touch the thing!! Oh and don't play hide and seek with a blindfold on in a house you just moved into. Not only can you hurt yourself, but you may be playing with someone extra! Just saying. Like all scary movies, they use every trick in the book to scare you. But the atmosphere is new which makes it great all on it's own. The film brings back memories of the old school horror films of the late 70's. Plus knowing that it was based on a true story doesn't help but creep you out a bit.<br/><br/>But what I love about this movie is the power of family and relationships. The Perron family do all in their power to fight against the dark forces to keep their family safe. The Warrens make their efforts to not only save the Perrons from the evil in their home but also protect themselves. The movie could have been a straight 2- dimensional Horror Movie. But what made it more emotional and successful was the theme: the force more powerful than evil is the love of family. <br/><br/>Pay attention to the last thing the Warrens say before the credits roll, you'll enjoy learning about that case. I smell a sequel!!!<br/><br/>Movie Rating-9 out of 10"

","I've been interested in The Conjuring for a few different reasons. The most basic: I like scary movies, and I like them even better when they're based on true stories. On top of that, we got a very early look at this back in October, at last year's New York Comic-Con. The cast and producers gave the impression that they were personally touched by the story it's based on, and they really wanted to do this movie justice.<br/><br/>But can you judge a ""based-on-a-true-story"" movie the same way you judge a normal movie? Better yet, if you have no inside track on this film, and know nothing about what it's based on...will you still find it interesting and/or creepy? <br/><br/>I say yes...to an extent.<br/><br/>This film clocks in at just below two hours, and, if I'm looking at it strictly as a movie for entertainment, it's a tale of two halves. The first half is going to feel very cliché. The usual scare tactics and predictable moments sandwiched in between plot development. The acting is decent enough, but the kids might annoy you a bit.<br/><br/>Then, right around the midway point, when you've got all the background info you need, the movie puts its foot on the pedal. Without spoiling anything, there's a scene on the stairway that stands out, and it's from that point on that the movie finds its groove. You get hit with a hectic pace and some high-quality, satisfying scare moments that hit the mark, compounded with some fine acting and good music choices.<br/><br/>There will probably be some mixed feelings with this movie. The slow first half may turn off some viewers, but patience will pay off nicely with the way this one ends. If you like the supernatural, possession-type scary flicks, or if you're at all familiar with the work of Ed and Lorraine Warren, then this movie is worth a look. The Conjuring scores a 3.5 out of 5 on the BDBOS.<br/><br/>(Did anyone else notice that Ed and Lorraine Warren look like Robert and Rosalind Lutece, from BioShock Infinite???) <br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, then I'd like to invite you to check out my humble little page... www.facebook.com/TheBDBOS.

"rgkarim","8","2","5","19 July 2013"," Conjure up some bravery for this scare
","The trailers have ranted about how good and scary this movie is. Of course trailers often lie and overexaggerate on how scary something is. Well that's not the case for this movie, as The Conjuring has all elements that a good horror movie needs. Rather than filling the movie with gore, overacted screaming, and ridiculous killing as is the trend these days, this movie has a story that drives the horror within. Fans will be creeped out by the gradual introduction of the spirit, and further terrified by the subtle things done to the family. Of course creepiness isn't the only scare factor they have, there were plenty of times where the movie made you jump with a sudden noise or character. Those who ar ereligious will get an extra scare factor added to the mix, as the spirituality embedded into this film might get you stirred up at points. <br/><br/>All of these factors make the movie feel realistic, which again makes it scary to so many levels. The scariness was built around the story, allowing for the tried and true methods to not be overdone/ overstretched, or sloppily integrated into the movie to get a scare out of the audience. Even the characters were integrated into the story well, and once again the horror was built around them, although not as well with the girls. <br/><br/>Overall this movie is one of the better horror movies. Go see it, but don't set your expectations to high to avoid getting disappointed as often happens. Do yourself a favor though, DO NOT bring any kids to the film, or you're asking for trouble. <br/><br/>For a more complete review follow the link below: http://robbiesmoviereviews.wordpress.com/2013/07/19/"
"rgblakey","10","2","5","18 July 2013"," There is something evil in this house in The Conjuring
","When director James Wan burst onto the scene with SAW he clearly had a unique vision for horror, but who would have thought he would be the one to step out of the torture porn genre to some truly effective haunting films with Insidious. Now he is taking on the subject again with his latest The Conjuring featuring a great cast including Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, and Ron Livingston, but can he hit the mark again or will it be a haunting in itself? <br/><br/>The Conjuring follows paranormal investigators in the 1970s who work to help a family that's terrorized by an evil presence in their home. What starts out as a simple investigation turns into the most terrifying case of their lives. This is not only Wan's best horror film to date, but one of the better of the haunting genre to come along in years. The story is crafted perfectly with a slow build but is well-paced delivering an excellent horror film. The look and vibe screams the 70s and there is something about these stories taking place during this time that just enhances the overall experience. The performances are all great with Lili Taylor stealing the show later in the movie delivering some creepy memorable moments. The directions they take showing the escalation of the haunting are a true pay off as they escalate brilliantly. There are some moments here that have been seen in other films of it's kind, but Wan handles them some perfectly they almost feel like new territory giving this film the perfect classic nostalgic tone while also giving fans something that feels fresh.<br/><br/>This is one of those horror films that may not terrify the hardcore horror fan, but is sure to entertain anyone that understands and respects the genre. The average movie goer is sure to leave the theater creeped out at the least and is sure to carry some aspect of this film with them to haunt their dreams. There is already talk of a sequel and these characters are perfect for a franchise as long as they continue to pay close attention to the details and format used here to create a perfect horror film that is sure to become a classic."

","""The Exorcist"" has held the title of the most commonly voted ""scariest movie of all-time"" by Horror fans for 41 years. I strongly believe that ""The Conjuring"" will soon take its place on the throne. <br/><br/>Bold statement...I know...but I will explain why it is true.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with high hopes not only because the horror genre has been dormant this summer with the flop of ""The Purge"" but because I read many great reviews from early screenings that got me even more excited than I already was. It did not disappoint. If I was one to have nightmares, I most certainly would not be sleeping tonight. This movie will scare the living crap out of you like you cannot imagine. I normally judge a horror movie on how many times it gives me the chills/goosebumps, as I am not one to normally fall for jump scares. However, not tonight. I kid you not, I jumped countless times and about broke my armrest on my theater chair. The terror is unexplainable and it only builds stronger as the movie goes on. <br/><br/>So yea, it's scary so what?.. you might ask..well that is just the beginning. The acting is definitely great for a horror movie and I would call it above average for say, a drama or comedy where it is more strongly criticized. The cinematic effects/camera angles/audio/directing was A++ for me. There were no CGI effects that were noticeable, though I'm sure some had to have been done in certain scenes. The best part was, the plot was actually enjoyable and even if you took away the fact that it was scary as hell, it would still be a watchable movie. <br/><br/>I have seen hundreds of horror films and this is hands down the best in my opinion. Some will argue that of course, but in today's online world where so many think they are experts and feel like they mean something when they hate on the entertainment industry, no movie will be liked by everyone. Bottom line, you aren't a horror fan if you don't go see this movie ASAP..In theaters, this weekend. Don't wait. I wouldn't have been upset if it cost me $50 to see this movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, I would like to thank James Wan for somehow making a horror movie about possession and doing it so well that I haven't even thought about comparing it to the many others before it. Bravo Sir. We will all be blessed with more of his work than we already have been, in years to come. This is just the start of his prime."

","This is a rarity of a film. This is a rarity of a horror film. It relies on scaring the audience through shear visceral images and moments, rather than relying on blood, gore, and dropping of the Fawk word to gain the attention of movie-goers. We have been so attached to films like the most recent Texas Chainsaw Massacre film as they are the only horror films we can have as of late, but this film... It combines elements of classic horror and supernatural films like the Exorcist and Poltergeist, and so many others, to not only give the audience genuine, non-cheap scares, but moments that leave you in chills. Sure, this may be speaking from opinion, but it's kind of a rarity to feel this way in a horror film as of recently. Evil Dead, great and fun film, but not once did I feel goosebumps from what I was seeing. True, completely separate entities in the genre, but hopefully you get my point. A horror film is supposed to leave the audience in both a state of not knowing what is going to happen next EVER, and not knowing what to do once you leave the theater. And this film provides. Easily. James Wan is an incredible horror film director, and this is easily his best. It has deeper levels of character development than the common audience member might be used to, it has such a great sense of (Warning: film-major word about to appear) mise-en-scene for when anything at all is happening, especially during chaotic, frightening moments. It also has one of the absolute best casts I've seen in a horror film yet, right down to every. Single. Child actor. Unusual to say, I agree, but without a doubt, stunned by how good they were. No one in the film is up there in stardom, but this film is easily an example of them being showcased very well.<br/><br/>And this film has an ""R"" rating, and in my book, it deserves it. Not for blood. Not for language. No sexual anything whatsoever. How is it not ""G""? Well, this film does not let up on the disturbing imagery, and said imagery if far and far away from being subtle. Although, the subtly of some moments does work. Conflicting messages here, I agree, but understand what I am trying to get at: When this film isn't subtle, it works, and it is frightening. When this film IS subtle, it works, and tends to even be more frightening (I'm looking at you, armoire... you bastard...)<br/><br/>If you like being scared, or like even good films, please, please, oh Jesus-Tap-Dancing-Christ please, go see this movie. It is so absolutely perfect for a modern day horror film that will no doubt last for a long time to come."

","First of all let me say that i am not easily scared but i love the horror genre so with that being said the conjuring scared the hell out of me. I went into the theater with little more expectations due to the hype of the and i was satisfied in every way. With some of the most bone chilling scenes I've ever seen this is easily the scariest movie of the decade yet. This movie was chilling, scary and well acted and though it started of at a slow pace i never wanted it to end. James Wan has made his mark in the genre as one of the great horror directors of our generation. If you're not a fan of horror, this film is sure to turn you into one."

","Everyone has a ghost story or at least knows someone who does. Some people use these stories as a game, something you do while you sit around a campfire or something. To others those stories are not to be retold, instead they are locked away and you hope you can forget. I have heard stories from people that I couldn't believe and would never want to experience them personally. The only things I have seen that terrified me have been on a movie screen, and I have seen enough of those to know the rules. You never go and investigate a noise in a cellar by yourself, also if things start moving by themselves just get out, and finally never buy a house or some land if you don't know it's history. Unfortunately for the Perron family they didn't follow any of those rules.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" is a story of a family in the 1970's who buys what they think is their dream home in Rhode Island. Not long after moving in, things start to happen that are unexplained. Things like the house being cold, doors opening and closing on their own, and seeing people that were not really there. After a few months of these things happening, the family seeks out Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are experts on such unexplained occurrences. What the Warren's find is the worst thing they have ever investigated. Let's face it; we all like to be scared. We want to find that horror movie that makes us fear the noises we hear at night when the lights are off. With so many stories out there, you would think that they could make a movie that did that. Well ""The Conjuring"" is not there, but it is pretty close. Not since watching ""The Exorcist"" as a child, have I experienced the chills that ran up my neck. This is not a ""jump out of your seat"" scary movie, this is a tense and at times terrifying scary movie. Making you jump is easy, have someone appear out of nowhere, or a loud noise break dead silence. The trick for me though, is feeling like I should leave the closet light on because of the things I saw. Ed and Lorraine Warren's case files have been used as basis of a few films. Films like ""The Amityville Horror"". ""The Haunting in Connecticut"", and ""The Haunting"". Just like in ""The Amityville Horror"" in 1979, ""The Conjuring"" brings a story that will make you believe in things that are unbelievable. I think the best review I can give this movie is after the credits rolled, I believed what I just saw really happened. Imagine that, a based on true horror story that I believed. This is a movie that will have some of you watching it through your fingers. It may not answer all questions or prove to you that some things really exist. What ""The Conjuring"" will do that most movies like it don't, it will remind you of a time when horror was good and scary.<br/><br/>Brian Taylor<br/><br/>http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"

","The Conjuring was a surprisingly excellent film. James Wan really is beginning to create a name for himself in the horror genre. Most garbage out there overplays every possible aspect of it, throwing pointless scares at it's viewers from all angles. In The Conjuring, there wasn't too much of anything - every jump had purpose, every detail really meant something. The first half built suspense properly without any clichéd horror tactics, the end of the first half and a period in the beginning of the second developed the characters, allowing the writing to really flourish, and the rest of the second half was sincerely terrifying. With some excellent cinematography and acting thrown in, this was easily the best horror film in recent memory. 8/10."

","Renowned paranormal investigator-couple Ed and Lorraine Warren, just before probing their famous ""Amityville Horror"" case, visit a countryside home, teemed with demonic ferocity, and risk their life to salvage the whole family from evil clutches. Despite the slow-burning beginning, soon the film turns well-paced with its fearsome features. The movie setting perfectly pays panegyric to the 70s' horror movies. Sound effects and cinematography produce spine-chilling impacts. James Wan's direction is so intense and intriguing that it makes me sweat even in AC and causes stomach ache!! Wan vividly establishes him as the pathfinder of modern horrors. He knows meticulously how to frighten viewers with his treatment of satanic approaches and how to play with their fearful instincts. Wan sharply blends the same-old clichés of a haunted house and devilish possession that do not earn disfavor from me. I have to be impressed at how he tracks the paranormal movements and claims the terrifying outputs. Actors make their task well; especially Lili Taylor, Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga capture the major show. The movie brings diabolical fever upon me literally. Indeed a rare gem in the horror-genre and would be treated as an ever-green classic as we reckon ""The Exorcist"" still."
"chaos-rampant","Null","2","6","8 October 2013"," Eruption
","We have here a film made from the files of the same paranormal investigators behind the Amityville hoax. The film begins with a 16mm film they have shot around a previous haunted case which they are showing to an audience of eager believers, ourselves. We're shown other footage of possession, but nothing so far that couldn't have been doctored. <br/><br/>Clever, introducing us to a tentative world of uncertain narration. But a horror film must unfold from a ground of haunted truth so we miss that slippery edge.<br/><br/>No this is a pretty ordinary haunted house movie with bouncing balls, noises from the cellar and stopped clocks. These work for me when we have a concentration to the present moment, not for any of the animated gizmos, but for the camera that penetrates a thick palpable space, that tries to part a viscous darkness behind the door in which nothing yet moves but is at the brink of doing so.<br/><br/>I'm talking about that specific moment where our vision is ready to erupt, has not yet but we're already embodying it, hoax and truth blending in the tension. <br/><br/>There is some of that here but it's too haphazard for my taste. That is because we shift from haunted spatiality itself to exorcism, so we have all sorts of stuff tossed together: poltergeist, visions, demonic spirits, the gnarly exorcism which is always the centerpiece.<br/><br/>I think Insidious did a better job in the apparitions, but then it had a much sillier finale as we literally parted space to enter a ghost dimension."

","This takes place in 1971 and is based on a true story. A family with five daughters moves into this huge old house in the middle of nowhere. Almost immediately things start going wrong. There's a bad smell in some of the rooms, all the clocks in the house stop at 3:07am, the mother wakes up with strange bruises on her arms and legs and there's loud banging heard. The couple hires a husband/wife team of demonologists to check it out...and find out things are worse than they thought.<br/><br/>This movie does work. There were many times in here when me (and the audience) jumped or screamed out loud. It builds slowly but it works because you get to know and care about the family. When things DO go overboard at the end it's all the more shocking because you care about the characters. The acting is good across the board. Patrick Wilson and Ron Livingston are OK in their roles but Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor are superb in theirs. There's no nudity, sex or gore but some blood and plenty of scares with loud noises and things suddenly happening. Also the 1970s hairstyles and clothes are frightening too!:) Even though it is scary it goes on just a little bit too long and has its dull moments. I give it a 7."

It had the authenticity of a genuine horror flick from the 70's era before the slasher thrill came out and every bozo tried to duplicate dumb movies and call them horror when the only horror to them is their horribleness!! So yes I recommend seeing this movie! It was worth every penny I spent, which nowadays was a whole darn lot! $50 bucks for me and my sis to see this! Ridiculous' one shared drink shared nachos and two tickets and still ended up Being $50bucks! But like I said, while I'd of been peed at any other piece of crap this was well worth every penny and I am so happy I went. Funny thing is I never had even heard of it until this morning on the radio, but once I heard how it was supposed to be genuinely good and scary I went out the same day which says a lot bc I rarely go to movies. It's worth it take whoever and go see it bc the theater experience is a MUST with this flick. You'll be sorry you missed it if you wait!"

","James Wan directed 'Saw' in 2004, which showed America a different type of horror when it came out. It got six sequels and did very well. Then, Wan directed 'Dead Silence' and 'Death Sentence', which didn't do so well. Wan teamed up with producer Jason Blum for 'Insidious', which came out in 2011 and terrified audiences (I didn't think it was very scary). Now, based on a true story, comes 'The Conjuring', a film that did so well at the film festival it streamed at, that it was put right in the middle of the summer movie season. It had terrified audiences even more than 'Insidious'. I thought this one was scary.<br/><br/>In the previews of this movie they showed that this movie isn't just loosely based on a true story, it has the same characters, same story, same situation, and the real people say that this is how it went.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring' was very scary, but it had a few jump scares. It's not like the image that pops up is what's supposed to scary you, but it's the fact that somethings unexpected happens. I thought this movie would be better than that, but when I think back on it, 'Insidious' had about twice as many jump scares. There were only a few in this movie, though. The first half of the movie didn't have as many scares as the second half, and the scares were different. The first half build up on suspense and trauma that had me digging my nails into my legs, which were on my seat. It was so intense and suspenseful, but it would end with a jump scare. There were a few things with scary imagery, but most of that came in the second half. In the second half the scares had to do with imagery. There was only about one jump scare then, and it had to do with the fact that this dead thing was doing this to the family. There were also some suspenseful and intense parts in the second half of the movie, too, but they mixed imagery with that to make it stick with you, too. They pulled that off well. The imagery was very scary, and they didn't use it too much. There are some other things in those parts that made them scary but I didn't want to spoil them. At the end there were some scary things, but I don't want to spoil those, either.<br/><br/>The acting was good, and the writing was good, except for one thing in one part, but I didn't like the music very well. Something little would happen and it would play really loudly, and it wasn't that good, either... But I understand it was supposed to be like a 70's movie, so that's not really a bad thing. The movie was slow and kind of boring in some parts that I think it shouldn't have been, but all those parts were after a scare and were only about two of them. The main problem I had with the movie wasn't about the movie. It was the marketing that was the problem. Many scares in the first half were spoiled because of the previews, but in the movie sometimes they were longer and actually scary.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring' was very interesting. I very much enjoyed the film and it went by quickly. It had a few boring parts, but it was still exciting. During the whole second half, it was intense, suspenseful, scary, and very good. The first half was also good, too, it just had more problems.<br/><br/>The movie was very scary and great. It's a horror movie, so it being scary goes for the rating, and it bothered me later, so that adds to the rating, making it a 10/10, which means excellent. It didn't bother me later very much, but it did throughout the whole time I was home. 'The Conjuring' isn't perfect, but it's still excellent. I don't think I liked it as much as I liked 'Sinister', but it was very close. 'The Conjuring' was scarier than 'Sinister', though. I will probably buy this movie on Blu-Ray and DVD when it comes out. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is thinking about seeing it."

","I love horror films. I usually watch them alone at home with the lights off just to feel that true fear that I felt as a kid watching Amittyville Horror for the first time. I wont have to do that with this movie. Even surrounded be over a hundred people in the theater i still felt that terror that made me fell like a kid again. I recommend that ever one see this that can handle a few scary dreams the night after watching it.<br/><br/>I am going to see it again with different people just to see if i feel that fear again. However, PLEASE, if your going to see this, have respect for the people how are going to see it and enjoy it. No one need to know how scared you are verbally or listen to your live commentary of the movie. Just go and enjoy the movie with no talking. I wasn't that lucky sitting in front of teenagers, but still enjoyed it."
"jrobthornton","9","2","6","19 July 2013"," I love horror movies, and I shrieked at this one
","This movie was great! I was so excited for it to come out and when it did and it was getting reviews that it is, I sprinted to the theater. I watch horror movies all the time and leave them unscathed. I watched the exorcist and laughed at it. The only horror movie that truly made me freak out was The Amytiville Horror, (the original, not the remake. I mean, why a remake?). And the two share many similarities. Just more ghosts in this one. There were scares from twenty minutes in, and then on. The first scene even made me jump. That freaking doll....... This was also a very original horror movie, in it's own way though. The plot is the same as most haunted house movies. However this one incorporated the whole satanist thing, which I didn't expect. And most would think that wouldn't work. But they way it was written worked so well that no other film of the similar sub-genre should even try to do it. I was very pleased with this movie and even shrieked, (And I've never done that at a movie before. Only let out laces of profanity or a very loud ""OH MY GOD""). This was a fun, terrifying film that was well written and it didn't have much violence, no language, and no sex at all. Most horrors rely on the gore factor or the sex appeal to draw an audience. But with this being rated R for just straight up terror is a major feat. This was a near perfect horror-experience. I wait to see many great things from James Wan."
"philyanda","6","2","6","19 July 2013"," Good, but ""like butter scraped over too much bread""
","All of which follows is my personal opinion on the movie. Going into the movie, I had already done quite a bit of research on the Warrens, the family, and the events that took place. Most of what they had on screen is what reportedly happened to the family of this house. The Warren's are actual supernatural investigators (now, how reliable they are, I don't know, lol) and worked on this case and on many others. So, knowing all of that and seeing all of the trailers and whatever else I could find on the movie, I was fairly read up on it.<br/><br/>This may contribute to why I felt the movie was lacking. Most of the major scares in the movie were contained in the trailer and the majority of the other parts of the movie were spent on suspense and build up, which is no doubt necessary for a horror movie. But I never got the feeling that I was really connected with or to care for the family and other characters in the movie. I felt that movies like ""The Possession"" did a wonderful job of this.<br/><br/>I hesitate to say The Conjuring was horrible, though. But I would say I feel it could have been much better. I felt they spent more time then they should have on the suspense and on each night's scare than on the family and getting to know them. They also introduced the history of the house and the Warren's and their family, which was neat, but perhaps they just had too much going on to successfully have depth with each of these aspects? This was my major concern. It was a good movie, but it felt like they spread themselves too thin in the making of it and what they tried to portray in all of these different arenas.<br/><br/>The movie had an old school kind of horror movie feel which I really appreciated. There were pop out scares, but they were few, and there was a lot of suspense/build up, which was really cool, but I would have hoped that, in old school horror movie style, they would have spent more time on dialogue and character development. In some ways this movie is almost like watching a case study from the Warren's perspective about this other family. But that wasn't fully developed enough either.<br/><br/>So, all in all (and I don't hope to be too negative in this review, I just want to be honest about it), I'd recommend this if you are a haunted house/ exorcism/ possession horror fan, but if you have researched and seen all of the trailers for this movie like I had, you may walk out a bit disappointed. (But perhaps my expectations were just too high?) Anyway, good movie overall. Just a bit lacking for me. The cast did an excellent job, though. Vera Farmiga was superb as were pretty much all of the actors. I just wish this movie had more depth to it. It didn't feel that original or different from movies of the same genre. But it was certainly interesting and it held your attention from beginning to end!"

","I had the privilege to see this film tonight going in to see a typical scary movie I left seeing what I thought what was a great film and the best from James Wan who I must say has really matured since the days of saw, but manages to still scare the sh** out of me. I thought the movie did great with the characters and sneaking in the Warrens most famous cases (be on the look out one is very small the other we see instantly.) I give this such a high rating because I feel like this is definitely the film to see this weekend and definitely the horror/thriller film to see this year. (well lets wait to see how Insidious 2 plays out) but I give this film a 4.6/5 stars but mix that with 2 huge thumbs up. the only bad is since this isn't your typical scare you instantly film it feels like it might take a bit to get the ball rolling but it doesn't leave you stranded in fact it lets you get to know everyone and then when they ball starts rolling faster let me tell you it does NOT stop. Do yourself a favor SEE THIS FILM.<br/><br/>The Good: I feel like the makers respected the source in which the film is based. Plus it chooses to scare you in not predictable ways. I waits for your guard to be down WHICH ROCKS. plus they don't try making these people out to be the Ghostbusters they are just 2 normal people who have a gift of hunting ghosts The Bad: The only thing id say is bad is at first the pace BUT only in the beginning like I said I expected it to be straight up scary from the get go and be generic but it surprised me to be a film that will be one day a classic"
"Kuato-Lives","9","2","6","18 July 2013"," Best Horror Film of The Year So Far
","The Conjuring (2013) is a supernatural horror film based on a true story directed by James Wan. It stars Patrick Wilson, Lili Taylor, Vera Farmiga and Ron Livingston.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is about a family, the Perrons who move into a new house only to discover it is haunted by a dark presence. They seek help from the Paranormal Investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren who then find themselves investigating the most terrifying case of their lives.<br/><br/>Is this film scary? YES! Yes it is, no bones about it. I usually consider myself to be desensitised to horror films due to watching too many of them but whilst watching this it was giving me goose bumps and sending chills down my spine.<br/><br/>This may sound like your typical haunted house film that we've seen so many times before with the likes of The Amityville Horror, Poltergeist, The Entity and The Exorcist etc and essentially it is but it throws its own stuff on the table to keep it fresh and original. <br/><br/>What makes this film so great and helps it to succeed as a horror is the atmospheric tension combined with the frightening visuals and a few jump scares. Jump scares are often a cheap way to induce a quick scare but The Conjuring uses them effectively. If you take away the jump scares that it has you are still left with one hell of an eerie & creepy atmosphere and a constant fear of dread lurking in every scene. Because this film is set in the 70s it really helps with making it feel like one of those classic haunted house films. It has everything from an old house with a tragic history, a boarded up hidden basement full of dusty old furniture, a creepy puppet, an old mechanical children's toy, a witch, a possession, an exorcism, the list goes on and on. It also plays on childhood fears we've all had when we were younger such as monsters being under the bed, in the closet, things that go bump in the night. When you're watching this you know you're watching a horror film, there's no mistaking it for anything else.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is good, all the actors and actresses play their parts well so you believe they are the characters they're playing. You experience their emotions with them even though those emotions mostly consist of being scared shitless, you do feel the sigh of relief when their ordeal is over and done with. <br/><br/>The musical score is excellent and well composed which is another contributing factor to the all round creepiness of the film. It also has a few catchy songs from the late 50s/60s thrown in.<br/><br/>The Conjuring isn't just a great horror film it's actually a great film all round. This is a true classic in the making and one of the stand out horror films of this era. Already it can be compared to the likes of The Exorcist & The Amityville Horror and hold its own against them. James Wan really pulled out the stops and this film along with his previous ones have undoubtedly made him this generation's equivalent of the likes of Wes Craven, Tobe Hooper & William Friedkin, and a true master of horror. The Conjuring = 9/10"

","The Conjuring has all the clichÃ©s you would expect from a modern horror movie, but surprisingly, is not atrocious.
This movie works because the history is not that dumb. The script plays it safe, hitting all the beats from an average hounted house film, but without the stupidity those movies come with.
The actors do a great job, none of them suck, Patrick Wilson being the standout for me. Maybe the child actors are weak in moments, but never in a really low level.
The cinematography is beautiful, as usual in James Wan movies. There are some very memorable shots here.
The blend of old school and modern horror really is interesting, there are not many jumpscares. Thank god.
I would go and say this may be the best James Wan movie (yes, better than Saw) and one of the most decent horror flicks in recent memory. Very recomended."
"stephenabell","8","1","2","16 July 2019"," A Spookily Good Start To A Haunting Series...
","I'd heard bad reviews about this film from some friends so it took me a little while to get to it on my watch list... I've learnt a very important lesson from this, sometimes you're friends can me wrong...<br/><br/>In this day and age of average horror flicks, it's so nice to come across a true eerily chilling masterpiece, which this is. I loved the fact that this story, and the other conjuring tales, is based on reported ghost and possession stories. I won't go as far as to say that these stories are real, though I do believe. Of course, they have been ""Hollywood""'ed up to entertain the paying masses and get bums on seats. It's in this respect that both the writers, Chad & Carey W Hayes and director James Wan draw a perfect line to get the story across while making it entertaining.<br/><br/>Wan is great at giving a scare too as he utilises everything in the ""Boo!"" scare-book. From noise shocks to near-silent ramped up the tension. He plays with light and shadows to give you a nice scary atmosphere. This is something I've missed.<br/><br/>Added to this, great performances from the cast, especially the kids as they truly make you believe they are being terrorised by an evil spirit. The section in the bedroom, where Christine (Joey King) is pulled from the bed and then warns her sister that he's behind her is the constant to this. These two performances, along with Wan's direction that make you believe there may be something in the deep shadows.<br/><br/>All of this had me hooked right from the moment I hit the play button.<br/><br/>Should you want a good scare and a film that will stay with you for a while, then this is the movie for you."

","Decided to re-watch both 'The Conjuring' films, with memories of really liking both, after watching, and not liking all that much, 'The Nun' (which was watched as part of my watching as many films of 2018 as possible quest) very recently. Just to see whether they held up, as good as remembered and whether they succeeded where 'The Nun' didn't and didn't make that film's mistakes. <br/><br/>On re-watch, 'The Conjuring' does hold up very well and actually just as good as remembered. It succeeds splendidly in where 'The Nun' failed and has none of its mistakes. 'The Conjuring' is not a perfect film, but it is very atmospheric, well made and genuinely scary, or at least to me it was. It is a very familiar premise, done to death actually, but the atmosphere stops it from being too predictable and there is enough freshness. <br/><br/>'The Conjuring' is overlong but its biggest, and only big, problem is the final act. <br/><br/>It did become repetitive and lost momentum at this point and the very end felt rushed. <br/><br/>Other than those, 'The Conjuring' is very good. It looks great, especially for horror films released in recent years (too many of which have looked like they were made on the schlocky cheap). It looks slick and stylish while having a spooky setting and suitably nightmarish lighting. The music is haunting and not over-bearing, recorded in a way that is not overly loud or obvious that it spoils the atmosphere (which was great because many horror films seen recently failed in this regard).<br/><br/>Script is not too awkward and is structured coherently, with nothing cheapening it like sluggish exposition or cheesy misplaced humour. The direction is meticulous in detail and clearly shows an engagement and ease with the material. The story takes time to unfold but doesn't get dull. As said too, 'The Conjuring' is genuinely scary, with actual tension, suspense and dread, in a palm-sweating and heart-pounding sense at its best, while not relying too much on jump scares (they are there but have build up and were surprising).<br/><br/>Found myself liking the characters more than expected. The leads were ones worth caring for, didn't get frustrated with them, wish for more personality or annoyed by them. The antagonist was frightening, was neither over-used or under-utilised and didn't look cheap. The acting also comes off well, especially Vera Farmiga while also impressed with how Lili Tyler coped with a role that on paper seemed limited. <br/><br/>Summarising, very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","I will say when a spoiler is about to appear.<br/><br/>I have a rule that I never watch a horror movie with a gerund for a title.<br/><br/>But I made an exception for this movie because it was so high profile and people were just raving about it.<br/><br/>I didn't notice this first time round but yeah I guess it does have minimal sex or violence but the problem is that it didn't replace it with anything.<br/><br/>I actually tried to begin it once before I knew it was so popular and just turned off after 20 minutes. Trying to watch it seriously recently I just got bored toward the end and it's taken me a while to actually finish it, one bit at a time. I've watched a lot of horror movies which is really the worst thing you can do if you want to be frightened by them so I guess I have become a bit picky.<br/><br/>But I just don't get the hype. It's not that it's just OK, for me it is simply a through-away film that isn't worth remembering even for critical interest. Other horror movies I think are over-rated like Alien, The Exorcist or Child's Play, I at least sort of see the appeal because they're kind of different and have an individual.<br/><br/>But this is just a generic horror movie riddled with clichés: demons smell bad, demons are cold, demons have deep voices, the dog knows, ""something bad happened here""... I found the characters generic which is forgivable in a horror movie admittedly but when they try to make me feel pathos for them it just feels trite.<br/><br/>We get all the familiar horror schtick: the gruesome which, the Roman Catholic angle...I struggle to take a movie that expects me to just role with the idea that things that mock the trinity are bad guys and the Christians are the Saviours. Many Christians are wonderful people but I think we're at a point in human development where simply having the Christian god equal good just feels like simplistic propaganda. Maybe if it were an irreligious persons discovery that Abrahamic forces were after them...then maybe it could be frightening.<br/><br/>That we get some professionals on the scene to describe everything and give them names also kills any mystery or atmosphere and makes everything just feel under control so the remainder of the movie just feels like going through the motions.<br/><br/>(soft spoiler in this paragraph)<br/><br/> To knit pick a particular moment: they have this game called ""hide and clap"". The mother is in a room and the door of the wardrobe opens by itself (pretty creepy) and then hands emerge from it and clap. They should have kept the camera on the mother so we only heard the clapping.<br/><br/>(No spoilers after this point)<br/><br/>I also don't like the Annabelle Doll. It might be the more frightening design in real life but when contextualized within a horror movie, the more innocuous looking thing is always creepier. They should have stuck with Annabelle's real life design.<br/><br/>Ultimately, although it isn't a trashy movie, I still feel kind of insulted by it and even with the positive feedback it has received, people who are like me should not feel bad for missing it.<br/><br/>My 1/10 grade reflects that it sort of feels like it could get a good atmosphere at times but there's really nothing original here at all. The worst movie I have seen this year."

And its preference for atmospheric chills over mindless gore as well as controlled craftsmanship in almost all aspects certainly gives it an edge over other examples of contemporary horror entries. It's not flawless by any means but it gets the job done far better than its competitors."
"areatw","8","1","2","17 July 2016"," A genuinely terrifying movie
","This has got to be one of the scariest movies ever made and certainly one of, if not the scariest I have ever seen. It has a lot in common with classics such as The Exorcist in its disturbing nature, incredibly creepy individual scenes and ability to genuinely frighten you.<br/><br/>It takes a lot for a movie to stand out in this crowded sub-genre but 'The Conjuring' will be remembered for its disturbing imagery, edge of the seat tension and terrifying scare scenes. The film is well written, acted and produced and it is easy to become emotionally involved with the characters and plot.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring' is a must watch for fans of this genre. It is easily one of my favourites and is up there as one of the most frightening movies ever made."
"mistoppi","4","1","2","11 July 2016"," Could've been better
","The plot is annoying. A white family moves in to a house, something horrible starts to happen and no one comes up with the simple idea to MOVE OUT OF THE NEW HOUSE.<br/><br/>There were few scenes during which I had to keep my eyes closed - not because it was that terrifying, but because you just knew there were going to be some jumpscares. Jumpscares are effective in like the very moment they come to you, but they don't leave you paranoid or scared after the movie ends. Jumpscares are a cheap tactic to get you scared on that very second but not a moment longer. <br/><br/>And this movie could've been terrifying if it wasn't for so many ""scary"" scenes that just looked absolutely ridiculous. And you know what is the most terrifying thing? When you can't see the evil. Many of the spirits in this movie seemed ridiculous, and it could've been horrifying if we hadn't seen them at all. <br/><br/>Decent horror film, but there are so many things that could've been done better."
"lagcatswins","9","1","2","27 February 2016"," Extremely good movie
","OK i will just make a short review about this movie because it doesn't need a long one.<br/><br/>OK if you want to watch a scary or intense movie... Watch this one. I personally ... <br/><br/>don't think any movie is scary but this movie is just so good it's almost ridiculous. <br/><br/>Probably the best Horror movie that came out 2013<br/><br/>I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>I did to i think every person i know. So yeah take your time and watch it. You wont regret it for one second."
"Shopaholic35","9","1","2","16 February 2016"," Chills you to the bone.
","The Conjuring is actually an incredibly scary movie. You first get the old creepy house vibe like in The Amityville Horror and then it really begins to get terrifying. They use suspense and anticipation to set a truly terrifying scene. Sometimes the absence of something scary can be even more fearful and they play up that angle well. The whole ghost there one moment gone the next kept freaking me out.<br/><br/>The cast are also fantastic in their respective roles. Especially the children. You can genuinely feel their fear and see the terror in their faces. Each character is so impressive and I honestly can't fault the movie. It's a brilliant horror film and I cannot wait for The Conjuring 2."
"davispittman","7","1","2","6 February 2016"," Well made horror film
","The Conjuring is a well filmed, well acted, and yes, a well written film. Vera Faminga and Patrick Wilson have fantastic chemistry in this movie, and they acted very well here, they should be very proud of their performances. I love the visuals in this movie, the visuals really are high quality! Also, Lili Taylor was great here, she was a great casting decision, the casting all around in the conjuring is spot on. James Wan did a great job directing this film! The scares here aren't as scary as I thought it would be, which was slightly disappointing, but there still were some good scares none the less. The exorcism scene really was great! Scary/creepy visuals run rampant through that scene, which was how it was supposed to be! Overall, this film was a pretty well made film, but it wasn't as great as I thought it would be, but that doesn't mean it was bad. 7/10 for The Conjuring."
"mishalomer","8","1","2","6 January 2016"," You should not miss this movie
","Generally i think horror movies are waste of time, most of them have bad stories and their only aim is to make you terrified, so when my friend recommended this movie for me i wasn't so excited about watching it, however i watched it, and i can say that this movie is actually different from other horror movies. The most important thing that makes this movie incomparable is the fact that it is based on true events, this fact makes the movie very interesting and you won't miss any scene. The acting was very good and i loved Vera Farmiga for her performance in this movie, Patrick Wilson was good although sometimes you may feel that his expressions are little bit mannered. The music and sound is really exciting and the photography was also great. After watching this great movie i can confidently say that this movie is the best horror movie in the last years.. simply a masterpiece! so i strongly recommend it even for those who are unlikely to watch such movies of this genre.. don't miss it."
"sergepesic","8","1","2","20 December 2015"," Old-fashioned spine- chiller
","These days it is harder to find a good horror movie than be a presidential candidate. The amount of sheer dross is staggering. ""The Conjuring"" is really an old-fashioned ghost/possession spine-chiller. There is an innocent family and not so innocent house in, of course, New England (where else?). Peaceful countryside, rickety old house with appropriate noises, and the vengeful former inhabitants. And all of this could have so easily slipped into the bad symphony of clichés, but for a steady hand of a smart movie director named James Wan. With a right amount of old, reliable tricks, but put together with fresh hands, it gives a jolly good scare. The only blemish is ever so sweetened ending in an old moronic Hollywood tradition. God forbid something doesn't get neatly wrapped up. That would be the end of the silly world we know."
"classicalsteve","9","1","2","2 November 2015"," One of the Best Exorcism/Possession Films Since the Exorcist and Poltergeist
","First off, I do not believe there is enough scientific evidence to prove the existence of demons and evil spirits capable of infiltrating homes and bodies to induce the blender to spontaneously make milk shakes or stimulate hall clocks to reset themselves to a particular time. So I view The Conjuring as a great story, inspired by and loosely based upon a real case study of a ""haunted house"" which Lorraine and Ed Warren investigated and eventually interpreted as demonic possession. (Their other famous case, the so-called Amityville Horror has been under much dispute and scrutiny since their original investigation, which may have been an elaborate hoax.) <br/><br/>Without having done any background research, I hypothesize much of the events as depicted in The Conjuring were exaggerated for dramatic affect. If you can put aside the idea that this is a ""true"" story, there is much to enjoy for supernatural horror film buffs. Carefully timed scenes make you jump from your chair, similar to ""The Shining"", which is something I haven't experienced in a horror film of this sort since ""The Sixth Sense"". Also, the film is not too ""bloody"" but relies more on its scare tactics.<br/><br/>The story is loosely based upon the real-life investigation by the Warren's of a house owned by an American family, the Perron's, in the early 1970's. The film begins with one of the Warren's other cases, the so-called Annabelle doll case, before cutting to one of their lectures on paranormal investigations at a university. The main story thread focuses on The Perron's, a married couple and their five daughters, who move into a house in the countryside in New England. Almost from the beginning, they experience some strange occurrences in their house. The first tip-off is an incident with their dog, who doesn't wish to enter the house. Then creaking doors, strange knockings, and glimpses of apparitions terrorize the family at night, which also fosters the somnambulism (i.e. sleepwalking) of one of the daughters.<br/><br/>When the house becomes nearly unlivable because of the nightly disruptions, the mother Carolyn Perron (Lilli Taylor in an absolutely convincing performance) tracks down the Warren's. They agree to investigate employing a combination of ESP on the part of Lorraine Warren and technological tools via cameras and tape recorders. As they continue to learn more about not only the recent history of the disturbances, they learn the history of the house which tells many secrets. In particular, two supernatural centers for the unrest are unused basement filled with antique furniture and an old tree near the creek slightly away from the house.<br/><br/>While I don't think the Conjuring should be taken seriously as a true-to-life story, it's a horror-fest roller coaster ride. The directing and camera work create the perfect balance of frights, suspense and horror to keep you watching to the next door creaking, relieved when the ""thing"" appears then vanishes. The supernatural malevolence is only gradually revealed, as it should be, until the final denouement. As a horror film, it works well and deserves a place alongside some of the other films of its type, such The Exorcist (still the best film in this genre), and Poltergeist. Simultaneously, is this really how the incidents unfolded in real life? I doubt it."
"joeravioli","7","1","2","1 November 2015"," The Conjuring conjures fear
","The Conjuring manages to be terrifying without being gory, which I suppose could be considered a feat, given the irredeemable amount of bloody body parts we have to put up with in today's horror films. I make it a rule to avoid horror movies in general, not only because I get frightened easily, but because horror films too often sacrifice important narrative and technical elements, including character, emotion, style, and coherence in favour of cheap thrills (often fuelled by gratuitous violence) that serve no purpose other than to keep you up at night, fearing that whatever was in the film is inexplicably standing at the foot of your bed. The Conjuring borders precariously on this edge between a solid film and a pointless, incoherent scarefest. However, a few neat scenes, a thrilling conclusion, and a surprising effectiveness without resorting to gore save it from succumbing to the tropes of its miserably empty genre.<br/><br/>The Conjuring revolves around a threatening demonic presence due to numerous deaths on a section of land that once belonged to a witch. A family of seven (five girls) moves into this house. It follows standard haunted-house film structure, as seemingly inconspicuous events (birds flying into the windows, death of the dog, doors creaking, mother waking up with bruises, etc.), eventually lead to more and more terrifying events. The buildup is done quite well, evoking simple fright, each jump scare or sinister occurrence building upon the last. There is one especially terrifying scene where the mother is lured into the cobweb-filled basement, and the most thrillingly simple, yet petrifying happening occurs, demonstrating that she is not alone in the dark, silent basement. I, for one, was scared out of my mind.<br/><br/>Eventually, the family is forced to call upon ""demonologists"" Ed and Lorraine Warren, who arrive at the house with an assistant and a police officer, setting up a paranormal monitoring network that is very, almost too reminiscent of the one in Poltergeist. Lorraine, who is a clairvoyant, begins to unearth the house's dark secrets, slowly piecing together the puzzle as the supernatural presence becomes more and more threatening, not just to the family, but eventually extending to the Warrens as well, introducing an unexpected, yet highly appreciated risk factor.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is fun, if your idea of fun is revelling in gleeful fright. It has enough jump scares (some of which are admittedly awesome) and suspenseful moments to keep your eyes fixed towards the screen, anticipating, yet dreading what is going to happen next. The execution is slick, and the story, while borrowing from other horror films, manages to be unpredictable and fun. The dialogue, however, is quite often lacking in substance, relying on basic verbal clichés that occasionally make no sense given the circumstances. There is way too much on random Satanic based information and bits about the power of God. Also, the film has a difficult time establishing the mood, as it bounds haplessly from serenity to dread, often for no reason at all. But what eventually separates the film from other entries in the genre is its thrilling and surprisingly emotional ending, which includes a ridiculously awesome line, and an even more ridiculously awesome monster reveal. And of course, the ambiguous ending. I hate ambiguous endings.<br/><br/>But what is extremely irksome about The Conjuring, is its refusal to set rules that make even the slightest bit of sense. We are left in the dark (so to speak) as to the abilities of the ghosts, the intentions of some of the ghosts, and their allegiances are so frantic and unspecified, that it is thoroughly impossible to understand why the heck everything is happening the way it is.<br/><br/>For example: Ghosts have telekinesis. Everyone knows that. So why (if the ghost's intention was truly to kill everyone) not use your obvious telekinetic powers to chuck a knife into someone's head WHILE THEY'RE SLEEPING? This is one of many galling plot holes that haunt the film .<br/><br/>The Conjuring has to be the most frightening film that I have ever seen, but that does not in and of itself make it a good movie, because it is fraught with plot holes and poor dialogue. What makes it a good film (and saves it from its genre) is its glorious simplicity, its ability to elicit fear without resorting to gore, and its awesome ending."
"zachcaslin","8","1","2","27 September 2015"," Set the scene before watching this film
","I've watched the full movie twice and The conjuring has hit me in two different ways.The first time I thought it was funny. I saw it in theaters with a couple of friends who made fun of it the whole time, causing it to not the whole effect. The second time I watched it, I was in my friends living room, in the complete darkness. Her house is huge and extremely old and really set the scene for me. That time I received the full experience. The fact that the film was based on a true story gave it a different feel. Knowing that the detectives were real people really gave it some content. However, in the theater, the two claps scene at the top of the of the stairs was a bit ridiculous. Especially since all 50+ people in the theater decided to engage in the claps at the EXACT same time as the film on the scene. It was however a good film given the right setting of the viewer. The movie had a little too many commercials before the released date, giving the viewers important scenes that should have been saved for the experience. Believing in the film allows it to catch viewers off guard, as intended by the director."
"mathijsschaap","10","1","2","20 September 2015"," The best!
","I actually kind of accidentally went to see 'The Conjuring'. My father told me about a scary movie about a haunted doll he thought was very frightening, and my stepmother thought it was this movie. It appeared to be the spin-off 'Annabelle' he was talking about, but before I discovered that, 'The Conjuring' had already put a spell on me.<br/><br/>The first time I made the mistake of watching it alone in the middle of the night. You shouldn't do that... You really shouldn't do that! It scared the hell out of me and I had to watch it five times again before I actually could say I had seen the complete movie.<br/><br/>Even though the effects are amazing, the scariest little thing to me was the clapping hands on the basement staircase. <br/><br/>It is said this movie is based on a true story and that can be possible, probable, but I seriously doubt these events could happen to a person or a family this way.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga has become one of my favorite actresses because of her part in this movie, and also because of her performance as Norma Bates in the 'Bates Motel' TV-series.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring' is perfect all the way and -to me- the best I've ever seen concerning supernatural horror-flicks. And yes, to me it even leaves 'The Exorcist' behind ;-)"
"osj2507","8","1","2","12 September 2015"," This was my first Horror movie in the movie theater
","I have always seen these at home, but the big screen, loud noises and total darkness just makes this so much better :) I haven't seen his earlier work like Insidious (but am going to now for sure), have seen Saw but that is something different in my mind, this was a very classic horror movie, the build up, the suspense, the revealing and the fast end (horror movies tend to have that).<br/><br/>The acting, the characters, the music, the scenery it all fits very well together in this one, we get a good introduction to both the Perron and the Warren families and both have their own small pieces of the big picture, but also kind of separate stories within. I didn't sit on the edge of my seat, but I did jump a few times, this was a classic horror story telling with the music that plays a big role in the build up and the sudden reveal of ""something"" that makes you jump."
"makailamarie95","8","1","2","26 August 2015"," Really Good
","The Conjuring is a very well portrayed and thoroughly executed film that's great for giving your friends and family a good scare. The movie is centered around Ed and Lorraine Warren, actual ghost investigators, as they tackle the angry and vengeful spirit still haunting the Perron family's home. While helping the family, Ed and Lorraine also face troubles with this certain investigation. There are several jump scares and many moments that make you want to hide and never come out. Many of the scares are based around supernatural forces (ghosts, dead spirits etc.), however, it's not you're average 'demon opens a door really slowly' type of supernatural phenomenon, which is why this movie definitely deserves and 8/10."

The characters were easy to relate to, the setting was perfect. Vera Farmiga became a favorite actress in after watching her amazing performance.

For me, ""The Conjuring"" lacked some of the poignancy and depth of ""The Exorcist"", but for all that, it never descended into self-parody.<br/><br/>Not excessively gory, your nerves are nonetheless on edge throughout, as early as 15 minutes into the film. Solid performances all round, good pacing, some nice cinematography, and a horribly effective soundtrack all help to deliver the goods. To be watched alone in a dark house!"
"bryank-04844","8","1","2","23 August 2015"," 'The Conjuring' is definitely the front-runner for the scariest film of the year so far.
","It's been a couple of years since we've had a really great and pure horror film, capable of producing genuine scares. 'The Conjuring' may just re-vitalize the genre this summer. Filmmaker James Wan brought us 'Saw' and 'Insidious', which both changed the horror genre when they were released. With this one, Wan set out to make an homage to the classic horror films of the '60s and '70s that relied on building tension and genuine scares rather than the CG effects and gore that we've come to expect out of most horror flicks these days. The results pack a punch that may scare up some box office dollars this weekend.<br/><br/>When directors pay homage to a genre, some get carried away and try to add too many of their favorite moments from other movies. We saw this happen recently with the sci-fi 'Oblivion'. In 'The Conjuring', we get a mixed bag of 'The Amityville Horror', 'Poltergeist' and 'The Exorcist'. While at times we can see direct correlations and rip-offs from each film, Wan does a good job of keeping things fresh and the scares moving fast. Although I don't think you'll be hiding under the sheets for weeks to come, this movie definitely produces some horrifying images.<br/><br/>The film is based on real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are most famous for their work with the Lutz family in Amityville, NY, which 'The Amityville Horror' was based on. In this one, they hear about strange occurrences with a family of seven at a rural farmhouse in Rhode Island. Before we jump into the main story, we get a scary-as-hell glimpse of what's to come from a previous case that the Warrens worked on, involving one of the creepiest dolls ever put on film. The image of that doll will leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>The setup is familiar enough as Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) and their five daughters move into their new big home in the middle of nowhere. Soon enough, the family members start to smell horrible odors, hear strange noises and see ghastly things. At first, only one at a time tends to see or hear these strange occurrences, which builds the tension as we progress through the story. They even play a game similar to Hide and Seek, called Hide and Clap, that involves a blindfold and is truly terrifying.<br/><br/>Once the hauntings get more severe, Roger and Carolyn enlist the help of the Warrens (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) to help rid their house of whatever entity is in there. Ed is reluctant to accept the job at first since a previous case made a disturbing impression on his wife Lorraine, and she hasn't been the same since. Eventually, they accept and head over to the Perrons' house with cameras, holy water, crucifixes and UV lights. It doesn't take long for them to realize that more than one force is in the house, including ghosts and demons. As we journey through the entire house of big rooms, closets and small passageways, we come to a chilling climax that involves an exorcism.<br/><br/>One of my biggest complaints is that the film steals too much from other horror movies, even the finest of details, which kind of takes you out of the moment. It doesn't happen too often, but when it does, it's a bit distracting. Another problem is the abundance of daughters that the Perrons have. I know this is supposedly based on a true story, but in this adaptation, five daughters seem too much, as we don't get to spend enough time with each of them and the movie has too much going on. Add to that the side story of the Warrens' own daughter having issues, which doesn't coincide with the main plot too well.<br/><br/>That being said, the film's creepy atmosphere and its many scares outweigh the bad parts. Livingston, Wilson and Farmiga turn in great performances. They're never over-the-top and seem very realistic. The one that really shines, though, is Lily Taylor. She gives a brilliant performance full of range and viciousness. With minimal CG effects, 'The Conjuring' is definitely the front-runner for the scariest film of the year so far."
"aesgaard41","Null","1","2","17 August 2015"," Almost Decent Haunted House Movies Turns Stupid
","Hollywood has a strange notion of what a scary movie is. What they think is ""scary"" is actually ""surprised."" You can get over being surprised, but if you're really absolutely positively scared, you will still feel that cold shiver you got three to four years later while remembering what scared you, but then that's just me. I've read so much about real ghosts that the fake stuff in the movies doesn't chill me at all. Even modern horror movies don't know what it takes to really scare people. Compare a weak installment like ""Occulus"" to movies like ""The Amityville Horror"" or ""The Others,"" movies you likely watched between your fingers, and you realize it's what you think you're going to see that is going to scare you. It's because older horror movies knew how to exploit what scared you. Today, movies like ""The Conjuring,"" ""Insidious"" and ""Sinister"" try to follow in that vein with the addition of adding disturbing imagery within chilling shadowy settings. What we have with ""The Conjuring"" is a file from Ed and Lorraine Warren. It is ""based"" on a true story, but since it has been embellished, exaggerated and had fake incidents added, the movie is about as fictional as the books claiming John Wilkes Booth escaped. It tells the story of the Perron family and the hauntings they experienced on their Rhode Island farm. The opening activity consists of poltergeist activity and odd sounds, it's charming and quaint, adding atmosphere to a story that should be building in intensity but instead goes Hollywood with the arrival of Ed and Lorraine Warren, self-proclaimed demonologists who Hans Holzer called ""religious zealots posing as paranormal researchers."" I'm not sure what really happened at the Perron Farm, but anything concerning the Warrens always go from a straight haunted house movie to a bad rip-off of ""The Exorcist."" Is the movie scary? Yes. Is it a good plot? Hell, no. What the movie does have is a good cast, some decent special effects and several good scares, but it's only the first half of the movie is really watching before it descends into malarkey about demons and ends with a very unnecessary possession/exorcism scene which doesn't add or further the plot except to add some disturbing scenes to a movie that was already only partially scary to begin with. If anything, ""The Conjuring"" runs like two different movies badly edited together – the first half a pretty decent haunted house move, the last half a really disturbing and sometimes really loud exorcism flick. Be warned and only watch the first half of this movie and switch it off when the Warrens meet the Perrons because by then, it's just not worth watching from that point."

I would be curious to know if these things are harder or easier to do in the horror genre. I would guess it's easier to stand out with a well-made, original- looking product, since so many horror films are made cheaply or without vision. But the Conjuring takes things that have already been done plenty of times--possession and exorcism--and still makes a story that is likely to be a classic of the genre."

","The Conjuring does something original in taking all the tricks of horror movies, using them correctly and without exaggeration, and being scary.<br/><br/>The Conjuring states it is based off a true story more malevolent than any our paranormal investigators have faced, and the terrifying horror does not disappoint.<br/><br/>Ed and Lorraine Warren are supernatural and paranormal investigators and pursue helping people against their own safety and despite being labeled wackos. In their work they have come across several demonic entities that have terrorized unsuspecting individuals. None more terrifying than the dark presence haunting the farmhouse the Perons recently purchased. The Warrens must investigate the identity of the being and expunge it from the home or risk the lives of family and themselves.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is the type of horror movie made to be watched in a darkened movie theater along with other anxious horror movie fans around you. The film grips you with a teaser of the type of satanic spirits you are about to witness and then flips the script by slowly unveiling the tense actions happening around the Perons. Perfectly paced, the menace haunting the family gradually building in the terror they subject the family, causing your own fear to grow with them.<br/><br/>Set in the late 60s to early 70s, The Conjuring uses its time period to be a timeless horror. No technology loop holes or idiotic human behaviors, just a happy healthy family trying to make a life for themselves unaware of the imminent evil in the shadows. The set decoration and clothes of the 'period' add slightly to the ambiance in being reminiscent of the original 70s horror movies that scared us first.<br/><br/>Normally where horror films of the haunting persuasion lose the ability to conjure fear is nearing the end, where the essence's form and back story is finally revealed. Not so with the Conjuring. Only a horror master such as James Wan could manage to continue the screams effectively and see the film to the end.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

Actually, once you're accustomed to the ghost category of scary movies, its actually quite easy to anticipate the scenes where there would be some sort of apparition.<br/><br/>Whichever, on the acting itself, it's actually quite good I must say and the actors really participate quite well in making the story credible. The story holds a really good line and doesn't part away through time. But I still wouldn't characterize this as the best ghost movie out there even if there are not many negatives to really speak about."
"Mikelikesnotlikes","8","1","2","4 November 2014"," Finally, a genuinely creepy horror movie!
","*Watch the movie first - come back and read reviews later*<br/><br/>Appropriately I watched The Conjuring late at night after the wife went to bed with the requisite creaking sounds of our old house settling to prime me up and create additional atmosphere.<br/><br/>I thought I'd seen enough supernatural/horror movies to be (comfortably?)jaded by the usual methods used to scare the audience. But The Conjuring proves that these methods still work if the director's execution is up to the task. <br/><br/>At first I thought I was watching a film from the 1980's (sort of OMEN production style) as I hadn't researched the film at all. This misconception led me to believe I'd coast through some predictable shocks and jump scares. I was not prepared for the genuinely goose- bump raising, nervous-look-over-my-shoulder episodes or epic flinches that were skilfully delivered.<br/><br/>There's a classic 'what's under the bed - better check it out' character action that I tensed up for that, according to my heart- rate, still works.<br/><br/>I usually like my horror a bit over the top gore, high action, darkly comedic, or with a sexy female protagonist so I was forced to sit back and wonder why I had such a high opinion of The Conjuring which relied on none of these layers. Just good actors, tight story, excellent direction and uncompromising production values. Wow! <br/><br/>One negative was the ""based on a true story"" premise. It worked well until demonic images and sounds were being recorded all over the place. This inconsistency overcame my ability to suspend disbelief and stuffed up that avenue for me. If they stuck to the premise that demons can't be caught on film, even though the characters could see them, this would have been more believable.<br/><br/>In summary - I haven't been that uncomfortable or scared while watching a movie in years. Allow yourself to feel the fear. Watch it alone (or with someone you can make fun of later), watch it in the dark, be angry when you slosh a drink over your lap during the jump scares."
"deanguitar789","6","1","2","14 August 2014"," Cookie Cutter Horror Film?
","In the past 5-10 years, the new, big, box office movies that everyone tells you to go see or is hyped up about fit into a few categories, especially in the horror genre. Lately, it's been a zombie apocalypse or demon possession movie. Not saying these are the only types of horror movies that are coming out, but movies like World War Z, I Am Legend, Warm Bodies, Last Days On Mars, VHS, Contracted... as well as Haunting In Conneticut, Last Exorcism 1 & 2, Paranormal Activity 1-5, The Devil Inside, Insidious; are all pieces of the puzzle. <br/><br/>What does it take to make it a good horror film? Well, the answer is going to be different for everyone. Are you watching a horror movie to jump, make your brain feel like it's gonna explode, laugh, because it's supernatural, because it's possible, impossible? These are all for the eye of the beholder.<br/><br/>Graphics - 9/10 CGI and HD isn't for everyone, but graphics in the 21st century have improved so much. A lot of scenes in The Conjuring are very professionally done, especially with unique scenes like the bed sheet blowing into an invisible entity, a young girl pulled by her hair by the same invisible entity, and a lady tied to a chair that floats in the air. So visually, it is well produced, and not some B rated cult film.<br/><br/>How Scary It Is - 5/10 ""Scary"" again is different to everyone. This movie has both jump scenes and disturbing images. But a majority of the tense moments are things that you see coming. For long, tense scenes, this movie gets a 7/10, but for the disturbing images, some were just too forced and almost more funny rather than scary, giving it a 3/10, so for an overall rating, it gets a 5/10.<br/><br/>Storyline - 4/10 Horror movies usually aren't known for their great storyline, but it does make an impact in the film overall. Acting was fair, cast was good, however, while watching, one can't help but compare this to all the other possession movies that have come out in the past 5 years. It's the story we've scene many times: family moves into a new house, experiences slightly strange things at first, it progresses, they call in the professionals, then someone gets completely possessed, then it all goes crazy bloody, with screaming and either everyone dies at the end or everyone lives. That description sums up too many movies, and The Conjuring, although had some unique and memorable scenes, is molded too much like the rest of this sub-genre of 21st century horror. <br/><br/>So, if you came across this movie and have the opportunity to watch it, by all means, it's something that I would recommend watching, not because it's a mind-blowing, fantastic film, but simply because it wasn't a bad film. The demon possession franchise is a sub-genre that I don't want to disappear, but it's something that I want to see break out of the cookie cutter mold and develop into something unique and great."

"jerko-nackaerts","4","1","2","22 March 2014"," The Conjuring
","As a fan of horror it always excites me when a new kind of 'higher budget' horror movie is released. Sadly, 'The Conjuring' has let me down quite a bit, even if it was directed by James Wan, the same man who came up with movies like 'Saw' and 'Dead Silence'. In a lot of ways all the horror clichés became part of the scenario.<br/><br/>The first scenes were very promising: the introduction of the famous Annabel doll and the little chat Carolyn and Roger (very well played by Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) have with the ladies who were responsible for the possession of this doll were both intriguing and alluring But it did not take long for the director to ruin the whole concept of a haunted house. Seriously, when some kind of paranormal power begins to communicate with me and says she is a little girl whose purpose is to play games and receive love, my first reaction would not be giving her permission to enter the lifeless shell of a doll so she could wander about the house. As the story continues, there are a few well done jump scares, complete with visual effects, but I was not able to fully enjoy them, bothered by all these clichés I saw. For example, the moment the woman hears some strange noises coming from a basement hidden behind a wall, did she just think by herself: ""Let's investigate this all by myself without any kind of help. Nothing could possibly go wrong, right ?"" Clearly, the characters in this horror movie never heard of Murphy's Law: ""Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong."" Even the smallest child knows something bad will happen upon entering a dark basement.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the main theme of the movie is the haunting of a house by ghosts who are trying to kill the entire family inhabiting it (as if there were not enough movies about this already). The ghosts conveniently are able to drag the family back to the house, even when they try to escape. Luckily for them, a pair of exorcists know just what to do in order to stop all the horror.<br/><br/>If you want to see an original and scary film, this one is absolutely not recommended. If, however, you find pleasure in a somewhat cliché horror movie that will at times keep you on the edge of your seat, especially at the end, then be my guest."
"potoole1","9","1","2","5 March 2014"," Scariest move I've ever seen.
","I'm a middle-aged male and I'm not afraid of the dark, but I'm glad I saw this on a sunny Saturday. This is, without exception, the scariest movie I've ever seen. <br/><br/>The events in this movie were crazy, but still believable. Part of what made it so scary, in addition to the excellent movie making ability of the director and his team, was the realistic element of it. The Warren's were real people. They actually experienced stuff like this. They didn't see ghosts as some lost spirit who needed to be guided on their way. No, the dark forces in this story are demonic and evil. They can't just be encouraged to follow the light, they need to battled with and that battle is ferocious.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure I came home from the theater that day and watch a Winnie the Pooh movie just to clear my mind."
"brando647","7","1","2","7 February 2014"," A Well-Done Supernatural Thriller with Respect for the Genre
","I don't know. Maybe I'm just jaded but I wasn't all that frightened by director James Wan's 2013 hit, THE CONJURING. I'm a tough person to engage with a horror film or supernatural thriller because it really needs some special to grab my attention. I was never bored while watching THE CONJURING, and I was even a little creeped out by the end of it all, but there's just nothing here to raise this movie above any other supernatural ghost tale. It never quite reaches the entertainment value of Wan's previous ghost story, INSIDIOUS. This movie has the added bonus of being based on supposed actual events, if that helps increase the spook factor for you at all. It's about Ed and Lorraine Warren (portrayed in the movie by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), a famous husband/wife team of demonologists who've claim to fame include such cases as the Amityville House. Seeing as how Amityville has been done to death, this movie focuses on another of their cases: the Perrons. The Perron family begins experiencing unusual phenomena after moving into a little farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971. When it becomes apparent that whatever spirit or spirits haunting their home are aggressive, the Perrons seek out the aid of the Warrens. The Warrens soon discover that the Perrons' new home has a dark past that continues to torture the inhabitants of the home, and they must gather enough evidence for the Vatican to agree to an exorcism before the evil can claim new victims.<br/><br/>I suppose I respect THE CONJURING and enjoy it to the extent that I do because I understand what it's trying to be. James Wan isn't hoping to reinvent the wheel with this movie. Haunted house and possession movies are a dime a dozen anymore. Exorcism movies are the new ""big thing"" with a handful of them creeping into theaters each year, and most of them bombing. With THE CONJURING, Wan just wants to create the best film of this genre that he can, using all of the tools (and a lot of jump scares) that have been established for this genre. In that regard, the movie is a success. It's one of the better haunted house/possession films I've seen in the past few years. It was successful in at least creeping me out by the end of the film but I wasn't as blown away as I'd expected. The movie is sort of a victim of it's own hype machine. All of the advertisements and a lot of the reviews promised THE CONJURING to be one of the scariest movies in years and, well, no. It's got some nice bits, especially an introduction to the move focused on another of the Warrens' cases: Annabelle, the doll. For whatever reason, busted porcelain dolls are inherently skin-crawling and one that supposedly stalks its victims is a guaranteed spook factor. The final act of the film with the big exorcism isall right. Again, it's nothing I don't feel like I haven't seen before and it's hard to get excited for it.<br/><br/>The movie's biggest strength (aside from its director's obvious love/respect for the genre) is its cast. We've got Patrick Wilson as Ed Warren. Wilson is a man I'm surprised doesn't get more mainstream work. He's developed a nice history with James Wan, starring in both this and the INSIDIOUS films. Wilson's a great talent in the film and he's got strong chemistry with Vera Farmiga, who stars as his wife Lorraine Warren. Farmiga's another who brings a little class to the cast and these two starring together in the main roles brings the movie a little extra clout. Ron Livingston, one of Hollywood's best everymen, is Roger Perron, the head of the household who puts his family's life into the Warrens' hands even if he doesn't quite understand the situation they've found themselves embroiled in. The film also have the benefit of having child stars with decent talent. Child actors are an easy way to kill the fun but the girls who play the Perrons' children do a fantastic job. Everyone is bringing their A- game to the film and it never devolves into cheese. THE CONJURING works because everyone involved have a respect for the genre and unite in their aim to create a great modern ghost flick. And they do. Unless you're a naturally jumpy person, I wouldn't walk into THE CONJURING expecting the scare of your life but it is a well-done supernatural thriller with a handful of good, creepy moments."

A model of its kind, and the Warrens are more properly presented here than they had been in the TV movie ""The Haunted""."
"KMR","6","1","2","24 November 2013"," Good not great ghost story
","A decent spooker - it doesn't live up to many of the rave reviews it has received, but it's not bad at all. Most horror films these days are so by-the-numbers that the better ones like this often get graded higher on a curve. As with so many ghost stories I found Conjuring's windup better and way more frightening than the eventual climactic events - the atmosphere was so dread-filled that I (a died-in-the-wool horror veteran) was genuinely uneasy for the first half hour or so. As more was revealed it got less frightening - I still find that the less you see, the less you know, the more your imagination has to fill in the blanks - the scarier a movie tends to be. The performances were all top-notch, particularly Vera Farmiga as the medium; special mention should be made of the younger actresses, who were all very believable. Definitely the best horror film of 2013 that I've seen, but again, I'm grading it on a curve."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","7","1","2","16 November 2013"," Undeniable fun even for non-horror fans.
","I've never really been a fan of horror films and unfortunately the state of horror today feels more unappealing than ever. The scares are objectively cheap with these ultra-low budgets and flimsy concepts where few audience members come out praising the movies they pay to see. That said, I really liked the first Saw when I saw it a few years after it came out when I was much younger. Simply, it was a thriller that thrilled me for every second. Sure, I could end up watching it now and pick apart the acting and story, but I'm certain it still has a great nostalgia value. So when The Conjuring started to get praise calling it an instant classic from people who don't regularly like horror films, I decided I'd trust James Wan enough to check it out. And it certainly was a surprise. It may be creepy as you'd expect, but it isn't scary. However, I had a huge grin on my face during the scares because it's so much fun.<br/><br/>What the film has to boast is the great production value which it flaunts in every dynamic swooping shot. Like The Cabin In The Woods, it's utterly crammed with fun ideas that it wants to do them all at once. But this brisk pace is a blessing and a curse. It sacrifices suspense and doesn't give room for its characters to breathe, meaning the big character moments don't really land or feel melodramatic. It's fine though, it's a treat to have characters with a handful of dimensions to them in films like these anyway. However, the third act is so hectic that I just ended up switching off. Still, the film is special and sticks out among films today, even as a homage to the classics. The one thing that stops me from being sure where to praise it is that I'm not sure what tone it was going for. Given how funny it can be, it could be tongue-in- cheek, it could be satire or it could be trying to be taken seriously? Either way would be good for it, it's just I don't know where it stands. Solid entertainment either way.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I think this film isn't a bad one but I don't think that it's one of the best I've ever seen. The story is pretty simple but it's a little bit unclear: what happens when because sometimes two things are happening at the same time, so the chronology is a bit disturbing me. I don't think this movie is scary because there's too many screamers so we accommodate to it and it doesn't surprise us after a short time. And there's also something very strange about the Warren woman who has supernatural powers so she can see parts of the past and so her mind is hurt many times because she saw horrible things through her visions about murders and dramatic acccident that have created ghosts or evil spirits.<br/><br/>Finally, I think that it's not a boring film or a bad movie but I won't say that it's a movie that you must see."

Everyone keep saying that this movie is his masterpiece but its totally not, Insidious is better. Why? Easy because its more horrific than Conjuring and I'm really afraid like hell with Insidious but feel nothing with Conjuring. If you want some good exorcist movie you can try The Exorcist, I hope for his next horror movie he will just use his buddy, Whannel as a scriptwriter because he really know on how to make some new horror flick and always give us a clever twist in the end than this true story that have no twist and too straightforward. 6-7 are what this movie deserved.

It is a good film; Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are excellent as the Warrens and due to the fact it was based on real people and ""real events"" it has a certain validity to it that others don't.

If you haven't noticed it's hard for horror movies like this (exorcism movies) to get a high rating. I am a horror movie lover And I have seen many horror movies whether it's modern or classic. Frankly I don't think that the conjuring is that scary, Some scenes did Scare me And made me jump off my seat especially the scene where the ghost was sitting on top of the girl's closet wardrobe- but I don't think it's enough for a great horror. The idea of this story is okay but I think the background story of why the house is haunted is not detailed enough and it doesn't really get to you. I don't get why the with damned the house instead of the people who made her hang herself or the whole wide world who don't worship the demon. I also don't get the thing with the nurse and fat chick. Call me dumb but some parts of the story line is rather confusing. Okay so thats all the minuses. The up side of this movie is that although the genre is not brand new,it is refreshing. The actors are talented. I liked the acting of all the actors. Even the children, they are convincing. Good job to the director, and good job to the writer, there are some plot holes, but you did great. It's not easy to pull of that storyline.

"ZChrisJ1995","7","1","2","31 July 2013"," A rare decent modern horror film
","Over the past 10-15 years, cinema-goers have been subjected to an endless parade of bland, watered-down and just in general uninspired horror films, with pathetic remakes of previous classics being a common occurrence. Therefore it's a pleasant surprise when a contemporary horror film pops up that actually provides decent scares, as well as a convincing plot and commendable cast.<br/><br/>The Conjuring tells the apparently-true story of the Perron family, who are terrorised by various malevolent spirits after purchasing a new house. Gradually these experiences become more intense, so much so that they employ the services of two paranormal investigators, played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, to help diffuse the problem. <br/><br/>The film is excellent in terms of pacing, with there being a heavy reliance on the building of suspense, as opposed to resorting to cheap jump-scares every five minutes, a vice that most other modern horrors bear almost like a badge of honor. Small bumps in the middle of the night steadily mold into much more terrifying occurrences. I would liken the experience to the pacing in other evil spirit-related films such as the original Amityville Horror and The Exorcist. <br/><br/>The characters themselves are surprisingly more than just sex-crazed, teenage chainsaw-fodder. The various members of the Perron family all have unique personalities and traits, making them believable, and therefore relatively easy to relate to. Likewise, dialogue between the two demonologists, as opposed to just providing plot information, gives the impression of a genuine, loving couple.<br/><br/>The cinematography and mise-en-scene is perfectly suited for the film's creepy atmosphere, with dark, misty lakes and uncomfortable wide-angles and close-ups contributing to an overall, over-bearing feeling of dread.The film also successfully uses new techniques in terms of generating this deep sense of fear and unpleasantness, with for instance the game of hide-and-clap providing one or two memorable instances. <br/><br/>Ultimately, The Conjuring is by no means on par with classics such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Evil Dead, but nevertheless it is a drastic improvement on the standard toned-down, unimaginative rubbish that is repeatedly churned out today. There is a real sense of nostalgia for horror flicks of the '70's within the film, which were clearly used as inspiration for James Wan when creating this above-average shocker. Recommended viewing, for both fans of classics and new audiences."

","I went to go see this movie with the intention of seeing ""the scariest movie of the century"" as someone else had put it, but was finding myself laughing more at the movie then anything. I enjoy a good scary movie, but I can still make out the directors sense of humor every time I watch his movies. He enjoys toying with the audience, which is why his ""evil characters"" are always so mischievous and funny to me. His characters always have the same sort of funny makeup on, stylized in his regular fashion. I sat there more entertained and saying ""holy s***"" because this movie is so ridiculous, and not really scary. As soon as the Warrens showed up, I almost felt cradled by their presence, something I didn't enjoy! I wanted to be scared longer. I think it was a little too soon for them to show up. I got bored. I watched a few things on YouTube about the family that this had originally happened to, and it seemed scarier then what happened in this movie. I would have enjoyed seeing the daughters playing with the Ouija board prior to the crazy stuff happening, because apparently that's how it all happened. I would have enjoyed seeing the ghosts do more stuff before seeing their faces too. All in all, it was a good, entertaining movie, but in my opinion I would have scared the audience more and not cradled them in the Warrens presence for so long but maybe I'm just twisted that way."

It's the sub- plot of the Warrens that truly shines. It enables the audience to care for them, a character dynamic that usually is completely untouched in horror film. The rest of the cast is strong, creating something that finally isn't cheesy or cheap. There are barley any jump scares, which richened the experience. It was all tense build-up and the ""fear of the unknown"" that kept everything moving and my heart racing. <br/><br/>The film is also really well shot, and creatively done so too. The cinematography captures the nuance and subtlety that most horror films forget to included entirely, which was a pleasant surprise. The soundtrack fits the film well too, creating an intense experience. I really liked the multiple stylistic references to films such as the Exorcist and The Shining; they were smart and subtle and there purely for film junkies like me! There were a couple of cliché scenes and the special effects could have been better. Also, the characters introduced later in the film are pretty paper thin, and there are a couple of earnest comedic breaks that feel out of place. <br/><br/>Overall, I was truly surprised about how good The Conjuring was. I haven't seen a horror film in theaters...ever...and this was a good one to start with. The experience was rich with terror and scary without being cheap. I enjoyed The Conjuring, it's underlying messages, and the truly well done performances from that cast despite it being so large.

THE CONJURING is a very good movie that certainly deserves a lot of the hype it's getting but I'm going to stop a bit short of calling it a masterpiece or one of the best films of the genre. With that said, there's no question that director James Wan knows how to use torture (SAW) as well as scares (INSIDIOUS) but this time out he goes solely for the scares and gets quite a few very effective jump scenes. Not all of them are those fake jump scenes that are so common in horror movies today where there's a loud crash through the expensive speaker system that would make anyone jump and it doesn't have anything to do with the movie. No, there are generally some creepy scenes here that I'm not going to ruin but you'll certainly never look at hide and clap the same way again. The director also does a very good job with the 1970s setting as the entire film really does look like the movies that would have been made in that decade. The film also benefits from some extremely strong performances with Farmiga turning in another excellent performance. She's really been doing some great work over the past few years and even in a genre that a lot of people look down on. Wilson is also effective as her husband as is Rob Livingston and Lili Taylor as the haunted couple. I think the film eventually falls off its tracks during the final thirty-minutes and once the possession stuff started I just slipped out of the movie. I guess we've simply seen this stuff a bit too often and there just wasn't anything effective during these scenes. Still, the tension and creepiness throughout the first two-thirds of the film are strong enough to make this worth seeing."
"mm-39","8","2","7","20 July 2013"," Eight out of ten
","Eight out of ten, and here are the reasons why. The strong story is about how a demonic attack happens. How the Warren's detect and deal with demonic forces. The actors/characters create a mixture of fear and rational behavior which makes the conjuring believable. Director James Wan creates a slow build up of horror where the viewer feels a bad event is going to happen, but does not know what kind of event. The director created enough character development which builds up empathy for the family where one experiences the haunting as a family member. My wife found The Conjuring creepy. Myself, I found the Conjuring to be a good ghost story."
"waldo621","5","2","7","19 July 2013"," It was aight.
","It's a very well done horror flick. I'll give it that. But we've already seen all of these things in recent horror flicks. It's the same stunts, same scenarios, same scare tactics. It's nothing new. The movie took a little bit from the Paranormal Activity movies (makes sense-same director) and a little bit from all of these exorcism movies that have come out as of late. It took all of these things which made for a very solid horror movie and the acting was excellent which definitely helped a lot. The beginning was kind of slow but it picked up midway. It had some good scares from that point on but honestly, I don't know if it's me not being afraid of horror movies anymore (I'm 21) but I really never jolted in my theater seat because of the movie but instead, jolted from girls shrieking throughout the theater- that's really what scared me I realized. I was more worried for them than the characters in the movie. And I kind of hated that because the girls/general audience were/was getting frightened from things in the movie that really weren't that scary or they were just lame attempts to scare you. So I think I just don't ""buy"" horror flicks in general but for a horror flick, I do recognize that this would be considered a good one, meaning better than the others. Still, I would like to see some new scare tactics so that I feel as if I'm watching something original."

","creator of one of the most disturbing movies by far the Saw once again carved his name with golden letters pulling off an outstanding, outlandish movie by digging deep into the roots of real fright elements of human nature. He not only embedded the real intensity of dimensional startling feelings but he also derailed from the anomaly to conjure the cinematographic fright elements back into the horror genre. I have stayed away from writing reviews regards to recent scary movies as I regretted seeing all twisted comments over the most ridiculous movies ever by people whose reviews resonated in the raving realm. James Wan is one of the rare directors in the movie industry bringing the ultimate fear intensity to the nature of human beings . Tiny Tim's tip toe song being played in the most disturbing scenes of the movie sinister showcases the real intensity. I would recommend this movie to my worst enemy. The premise is based on a true story which panned it's reputation for years in Rhode Island area . People who bash about paranormal stupidity movies would dislike this movie as their sense of fear and their likes regards to horror genre is as cheap as wal-Mart sushis . This move glued me tight to my narrow seat pulling my legs upto my abdomen. Do not go to watch this movie to have rest in sleep cause you will be having hard time drifting off to sleep as every single noise or rattle will wire you up. Avoid watching this movie if you are a wuss . Kudos to Wan by making such a great movie. James, you have literally set your fame back in the game. Keep making great movies like the conjuring. Avid fans of paranormal activity movies will hate you for sure . James Wan has gotten his swagger back with this movie !! go and watch it . you will be startling till the credits roll.

"BA_Harrison","5","1","3","28 January 2018"," This Wan lacks originality.
","James Wan has directed three of the biggest horror hits of the millennium thus far: Saw (2004), Insidious (2010) and The Conjuring (2013). Saw was a wholly original shocker, a twisty-turny torture pic well deserving of its success. Insidious breathed new life into the well-worn supernatural genre with its really freaky atmosphere and well-crafted scares. The appeal of the Conjuring, on the other hand, has me puzzled, the film being little more than a collection of generic clichés borrowed from countless other possession movies.<br/><br/>Purportedly based on a true story from 1971, The Conjuring stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren, who are called to the home of the Perron family, who have been experiencing terrifying unexplainable occurrences since recently moving into the old house. A little research reveals that the property had once belonged to a witch named Bathsheba, who killed her child and hung herself, putting a curse on anyone who took her land. After lots of creepy phenomena - moving doors, ghostly apparitions, strange noises etc. - wife and mother of five girls, Carolyn Perron, is possessed by the witch and attempts to sacrifice her youngest daughter, at which point the film switches from a lame facsimile of The Amityville Horror/Poltergeist to an equally lame copy of The Exorcist, with the Warrens trying to cast out the evil spirit.<br/><br/>Stopping just short of a 360-degree head spin, the film really does offer very little new to fans of the genre, even throwing in a creepy doll called Annabelle for good measure (Annabelle would go on to be the subject of a couple of spin-off movies). I guess if you're new to horror, and haven't seen a lot of similarly themed flicks, The Conjuring would seem like a pretty scary ride, but it left me distinctly unimpressed.<br/><br/>4.5 out of 10, rounded up to 5 for IMDb."
"Horst_In_Translation","4","1","3","5 January 2017"," Starts off solid, but doesn't stay that way
","""The Conjuring"" is an American English-language movie from 2013, so this one is also quickly approaching its 5th anniversary. IMDb categorizes it as a mix of horror, mystery and thriller and I think that sums it up pretty well, even if I would say the horror component is the most dominant. It runs for 110 minutes approximately and it is probably the most known work by both director James Wan and writer Chad Hayes, who worked on the script with his twin brother Carey, or at least among the most known. The film was successful enough for a sequel and that one is also by the people I just mentioned. The cast does not really include A-listers, but that's not a problem as horror films are usually much more about the scare factor and also about the script than really about great performances. The most known name you will find in here is probably Oscar nominee Vera Farmiga. She plays one half of a duo that specializes on investigating supernatural phenomenons and the Perron family is just the perfect occasion for them and their profession. This family, parents and a whole lot of children, just moved into a house at the countryside where they quickly realize things aren't normal at all. They find out an evil spirit is haunting them and it may drive them insane. So they decide to consult Farmiga's and Wilson's characters.<br/><br/>I personally enjoyed the first half of the film for the most part. It was nothing really new we got here, but the ways they used the unseen danger or included frightening situations were all done in a pretty competent manner. It sure manages to scare you and the camera work was done well too. Sadly, I must say the moment they really started fighting the evil spirit with the help of the married couple that is presented to us right away in the movie is when the film gets worse slowly but steadily. I did not really care for the exorcism sequences and the ways in which the Warrens/Perrons confront the enemy were also really showy, but not too memorable to me. Quite a shame because the introduction to the whole subject was pretty decent. I think the film also falls flat in really making an impact when it comes to the characters. Honestly, it felt to me as if all the family's children were entirely interchangeable and they did not seem to have any purpose in the entire project other than getting scared. Zero depth in character writing here and this also applies somewhat to the adult characters. Also the solution with the special family references about the ghost and the mother-daughter relationship they put the focus on did very little for me. This is also why at times I felt that the film took itself more seriously than it really had the right to and this went on until deep in the closing credits were we see real photos and the characters/actors linked to these. So yeah, I personally am a bit baffled by this film's awards success and strong reception. I am probably not the greatest horror film buff, but I have seen superior movies from the genre from recent years and they weren't even close to this one in terms of the strong reception. As for ""The Conjuring"", I don't recommend the watch and I have almost no interest in checking out the sequel any time soon. Thumbs down."

","I think it's very likely I saw clips, a trailer of a poster for this scary movie during the time of its cinema, I knew it was going to be something to do with ghosts, but that's about it, directed by James Wan (Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious). Basically set in 1971, Roger Perron (Ron Livingston), his wife Carolyn Perron (Ransom's Lili Taylor) and their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (White House Down's Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy) and April (Kyla Deaver) have moved to Harrisville, Rhode Island into a dilapidated farmhouse. After moving in, the family find a hidden basement, the entrance has been boarded up, Roger opens it up and inspects, soon strange things start happening to the family, starting with the unexplained death of the family dog. In the next few nights the family find themselves terrorised by paranormal activity, all clocks stop at 3:07am, they hear strange noises, then the spirit starts physically attacking. Carolyn decides to contact married and noted demonologists Ed (Insidious's Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Orphan's Vera Farmiga), they agree to take on the case, after investigating they determine that the house needs an exorcism, but they need church approval. Ed and Lorraine discover the house once belonged to accused witch Bathsheba (a relative of Mary Towne Eastey of the Salem witch trials), who sacrificed her week-old child to the devil and killed herself after cursing all who would take her land, they find there have been numerous murders and suicides in the house over the years. Ed and Lorraine set up cameras and bells around the house to gather evidence of a conjuring, the spirit lures one of the children while they sleepwalk, Lorraine follows through a secret passage in the wardrobe, and falls through the floorboards, there she sees the spirit of a woman Bathsheba possessed to kill her own child. The Perron family take refuge in a hotel, while Ed and Lorraine show the Catholic Church the evidence, the Warrens daughter Judy (Sterling Jerins) is attacked in their own home, but Ed helps save them. Carolyn is possessed by Bathsheba and takes two of the children back to the house, she is found trying to stab one of the girls by Ed and Lorraine, they tie her to a chair and Ed decides to perform an exorcism on her himself. The spirit tries to kill Ed, and Carolyn escapes at one point and tries again to kill one of the children, but Lorraine reminds her of special memories she has of her family, this allows Ed to complete the exorcism, saving Carolyn and the children, and lifting Bathsheba's curse forever. Ed and Lorraine return home, they have a message for another case to investigate in Amityville, Long Island, New York, the film ends with Ed placing the music box from the house on the shelf of relics from other haunting investigations, where the strange doll Annabelle has already been placed in a box labelled never to be opened, the box inexplicably opens and plays music. Also starring Shannon Kook as Drew Thomas, John Brotherton as Brad Hamilton, Marion Guyot as Georgiana Moran and Steve Coulter as Father Gordon. The cast all do their parts fine, the things going bump in the night and haunted house stuff works well, the possessed doll seen a little got its own spin-off prequel, it could have been slightly more jumpy, but bearing in mind it is based on true events it is overall a fair supernatural horror. Worth watching!"

","I come from a history of watching horror movies constantly, practically everyday. The Conjuring has been one of my favorites to watch since it first came out.

Though it had a numerous amount of scares, it missed some of the more heart pounding thrills. For instance, I'm a person that loves the feeling of being at the edge not knowing what is going to happen next. This movie did contain some of that persona but I wouldn't describe The Conjuring as a movie where one would be feeling totally scared the entire time. But it did have a great storyline and I would highly recommend it as a wonderful horror flick to watch to stay on the edge of your seat and scream in the theaters."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","4","1","3","10 November 2014"," Not bad but definitely overrated
","Don't get me wrong, I love horror movies, and I loved the recent similar 2012 film Sinister. But The Conjuring, although not a bad movie, just doesn't match up to the era it takes place in, nor is it very original.<br/><br/>The plot follows a family that begins to experience terrifying phenomena related to a Satanist witch who originally owned the land. The only ones who can help are two paranormal investigators, but things go really wrong when one of them gets possessed.<br/><br/>The Conjuring follows every chiche horror theme in the book. Evil possessed doll, creepy old farm house, haunted music box, melodramatic psychic woman, attack on a family pet, the list could go on and on of horror elements that have been used countless times before. Supposedly the movie is set in 1971. But the only real indicator of this is the one or two 1970's music hits playing in the background during various scenes. The characters look and speak as if you'd expect them to be texting, drinking Starbucks and watching movies on their laptops. The characters were too generic and I couldn't care less what happened to them, the soundtrack, aside from the two 1970's hit songs, was awful. The acting was okay but didn't suit the movie, and it was like watching a rip-off of The Haunting of Molly Hartley or The Ring.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, it just wasn't all that great. To be fair, the doll, although pretty typical, was creepy looking, and the acting, although not suiting the setting or plot, was pretty good. I can't say I'd recommend it but you may enjoy it yourself, it's all dependent on your opinion and preferences."

The monotheistic quote at the end really angered me quite honestly.<br/><br/>While the movie itself has great cinematography and a chilling soundtrack, the story and scenes have all been done numerous times before. Seriously, it saddens me that people are starving on this planet yet millions of dollars go to fund this religious bunk.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of horror, and you're not a die-hard Christian, save yourself the wasted time and watch one of his better films. If you want a good ghost movie try The Changeling or Burnt Offerings."

Overall, I was disappointed as based on the reviews and rating here you would have thought this movie really stood out from the pack. The biggest mystery of this film is figuring out why it was received so well critically.<br/><br/>As a fan of possession films in general, I had high hopes here, but nothing seemed to be improved upon or added to the genre with this flick. Sorry for the redundancy throughout this review, but I'm really struggling to find anything memorable about the film. It's truly a unremarkable, predictable. and uninspired piece."
"nitzanhavoc","9","1","3","15 March 2014"," The Wan and only, the Maestro of Horror, has done it yet again!
","As a devout Horror fan, I've seen pretty much every sub-genre there is, from Torture Porn to Comedy Horror. I must say that usually when asked, I say that Ghost Story is my favorite of the sub-genres, especially the Asian ones were the ghosts connect with my inner child and scare the living daylight out of the poor thing. However, films dealing with exorcisms and haunting / possession come as a very close second, especially when it's a good one like The Exorcism of Emily Rose or The Unborn. As of late, a new sub-genre has joined the list as no. 1 and as the best Horror international cinema has to offer: James Wan films. It has taken me a while to figure out that the best Horror I've seen in the passed 10 years has all been made thanks to that amazingly talented Writer-Director: The Saw Series, Insidious and Dead Silence are masterpieces in my book. Now, The Conjuring happily and rightfully joins the list.<br/><br/>The acting by Patrick Wilson is excellent. While his character is usually a little timid and not all that impressive, Wilson has truly proved profound acting skills playing the charismatic Ed Warren. Yet the really pleasant surprise is by far Lili Taylor as the mother of the family whose house is haunted. I haven't seen Taylor since Mel Gibson's Ransom, and had to look her up in order to even realize that, but if she never acts again this part shall be remembered as her moment of pure glory. I have seen many actors playing the part, and she still managed to amaze me. I believe ""Bravo!!!"" sums it up.<br/><br/>The story is great, and with all due respect to ""based on real events"" - I credit that to Wan. A perfect combination of Ghost Story and Haunting / Exorcism, interesting and compelling with great suspense. The script is even better, and I've been really impressed with how many classic jump-scare moments simply didn't happen! No cheap tricks, no cheats, nothing! At first the ghosts manage to frighten the audience without even appearing in the shot. We do see them eventually, but in two (maybe three) scenes only. The only criticism I have - without giving away any spoilers, there are two scenes I've noticed where the characters suffer a pretty serious fall, then get up with not so much as a sprained ankle. Suspense of disbelief is critical in such ""supernatural"" Horror films, and making the characters miraculously immune to falls slightly damaged it for me. Along with that, I was going to say the ending was slightly anti-climactic, and that I personally felt that the plot set us up for an ending that had never arrived. Then I saw that there is (or about to be) a sequel, which I'm anticipating greatly!<br/><br/>As for soundtrack and cinematography, I didn't notice anything too impressive or even worth mentioning (which takes absolutely nothing away from this excellent film).<br/><br/>All in all - the slight almost non-existent criticism I've mentioned is the only reason I'm not rating this 10. I've seen a review claiming The Conjuring is better than Insidious, and while I find it difficult to agree - it is an excellent film, a fine piece of Horror, and another great achievement by the Wan and only. I recommend this film to any Horror fan out there. Re-reading all I've just written for editing reasons, I realize that my words don't commune clearly enough how much I've enjoyed watching this film. Take my word for it - this is one of the best Horror films you'll ever see."

The acting from all of the cast made the movie seem realistic and I liked the whole pace and feel of the movie because it makes it feel like your really there with the family. One of the interesting things about the film is that the director didn't rely on blood and gore to scare the audience. He basically used sound and psychology to mess with the audiences mind, which was done very cleverly. The whole exorcism was also brilliant and it's not like all of the paranormal movies out there at the moment. As a person that doesn't usually like movies in this genre, this is definitely one of the best that I have seen and one that I would recommend to people who haven't seen it. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Patrick Wilson also starred in Insidious 1 & 2 so he must people enjoying starring in this genre. All of the cast, including the little girls, were a great choice by the director and I liked the way that he just got straight on with it from the beginning to end. The script is very well put together because it gives you time to know the characters before all of the strange things starts to happen. I think that you can tell that I really enjoyed this movie, which is weird for movies nowadays, so I won't keep harping on about how good it is. Judging y the money that it made, I am obviously not alone.<br/><br/>Budget: $20million Worldwide Gross: $318million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there psychological horror movies about a family with a paranormal surroundings. 8/10"

At times you expect something to happen, but it doesn't detract from the overall experience, it's more due to the music than anything else. Based on a true story, and you believe it really happened, doesn't rely on special effects to carry the storyline, the acting is good enough to carry the belief.

Whether you believe in ghosts or not, this movie will chill you to the bone and make you want to sleep with the lights on for a week. It will also make it impossible for you to ignore anything that creaks or thuds in the night."

","I gave this movie a 10, based only on the fact that it did, indeed, scare me in such a believable way. I use the term ""scary"" as opposed to ""horror"" as most ""horror"" movies are gore porn.<br/><br/>I love a good scare from a movie, unfortunately, those movies don't exist. The last movie to ever scare me was the original Alien, a close second was Dead Birds.<br/><br/>This movie is truly scary. Whether you believe the story or not, it is scary. Leave the lights on scary.<br/><br/>Intelligently done and perfectly suspenseful. There were only a few of the ""typical"" scary movie trademarks involved. From the time the family moved into the home until the end of the movie, my hair stood on end.<br/><br/>Personally, I have waited for ever for a scary movie. This is it.

","Wow, finally a GREAT HORROR movie thats nearly as good as the old classic ""THE EXORCIST 1973"". Lately Hollywood was making really lame horror movies that were more to BLOOD AND GORE. A good horror movie DOES NOT NEED BLOOD AND GORE to scare people. Well this movie proved that all you need is a talented director, to give you a really good creepy horror movie. I watched the WHOLE MOVIE, and i was captivated throughout the whole movie. And guess what... i'm now a FAN of Director James Wan. And i can't wait to see his OTHER HORROR MOVIES. So guys just watch this movie, you'd love it !! And i would also love to see what he does in FAST & FURIOUS 7 (although its not horror.. i'd love to see what he does with it)."
"rahuljonathan-nair","10","1","3","16 December 2013"," The most horrifying film I have ever seen!!!!!!
","Most horror films claim to be 'based on real life incidents'. While they rarely live up to the hype around them, THE CONJURING is an exception. The atmosphere build-up begins even before the film does, as a disclaimer is flashed before the opening credits, warning you that you might seek psychological help after watching the movie. The strategy works, as the film can scare the living daylights out of you. While we didn't feel the need to undergo any counselling, unsettling it certainly was. Wan does not succumb to sensationalising the story either. It's the subtle and steady build-up of suspense and psychological tension, coupled with sudden spine- chilling scares and dramatic silences that make you go numb with fear. Note: You may not like the film if you find psychological horror films disturbing."
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","5","1","3","2 December 2013"," Disappointing
","Allegedly true story borrows heavilly from another allegedly true story, The Amityville Horror, as a family moves into a creepy house in the woods, soon finding it to be haunted by demonic entities intent to scare the many kids who live their. A pair of paranormal investigators are called in to rid the house, and the family, of their ills.<br/><br/>Good cinematography, the film didn't resort to that obnoxious shaky-cam nonsense and try to pass that off as its scares. The doll was creepy looking, but it was like a gimmick that they introduced and couldn't be bothered with following through with it and doing anything with it.<br/><br/>Screenplay was a bit too cluttered and overly busy, with too much going on, and too many characters in the film. Too many kids to keep track of, and a father character played by an actor who left little impression.<br/><br/>Dark old house routine for the first two thirds was mildly interesting, if formulaic, but the film then oddly switches to a possession/ exorcism flick for its final third, giving it a feeling of being two different films awkwardly put together."

","Will you think _The Conjuring_ is scary? And by ""scary"" I mean something beyond jumping at loud and/or sudden things -- because those kinds of ""scares,"" the amusement park kind, are easy to accomplish. There are plenty of those in this movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, whether or not this movie finally scares you ultimately depends on whether or not you buy into the Judaeo-Christian mythos. It depends on whether or not you are a traditionally religious person ... because the makers of this film did not leave the ""evil"" in this film as some vaguely-defined ""entity"" ... noooo, this is a real live demon from a real live Christian Hell who doesn't like crucifixes and holy water a-tall, thank you very much.<br/><br/>As a result, this movie scared me about as much as the story of Noah and the Ark scares me.<br/><br/>_The Conjuring_ is professionally-made entertainment, but so are recordings by Elton John -- and I don't like _those_, either."
"hnt_dnl","10","1","3","12 November 2013"," Best horror film in a LONG time!
","For whatever reason, I had this feeling that THE CONJURING (2013) would be a great horror film! I had heard the hype (which usually means nothing), but in seeing some of the previews, it just felt like the real deal. After having recently gotten around to seeing it, my feeling has been confirmed! The Conjuring is a masterful addition to the horror genre, cleverly combining elements and ideas from many previous famous horror films, including The Exorcist, The Evil Dead, The Shining, Poltergeist, and A Nightmare on Elm Street. But The Conjuring still feels like it's own entity, thanks to great acting, genuine dialogue from a solid script, and moments of true and sheer shock and terror.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga head a superb cast. Wilson and Farmiga convincingly play Ed and Lorraine Warren, a married couple who specialize in dealing with demonic spirits and possession. The start of the film is 1968, when they help a couple of nurse roommates deal with a possessed doll that was terrorizing them. Flashforward to 1971, the setting of this ""true"" story, where we are introduced to the Perron family, who have recently moved to a country home in the upper Northeastern U.S. The large family consists of the parents Carolyn and Roger (excellently played by Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) and their 5 girls Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy, and April (convincingly played by Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy, and Kyla Deaver). I was IMMENSELY impressed by ALL the young actresses playing the daughters! They were all so in-sync with their roles, that none of them came across as the typical, annoying, unrealistic kids that are showcased in film. Their shock, awe, and terror seemed truly genuine.<br/><br/>The Perrons find that their new home is occupied by several ghosts that appear in different portions of the house (the basement, their bedrooms, etc.) Early on, one of the ghosts manages to kill their dog, then as things get eerier, they enlist the help of The Warrens to exorcise the demons from their home. The Warrens research reveal that the home was owned back in the 19th century by Bathsheba, the descendant of a witch. Bathsheba, possessed by her ancestor, kills her newborn, then hung herself on a tree in front of the house, but not before cursing ANYONE who bought and resided on her land in the future.<br/><br/>With the aid of their assistant Drew (solidly played by Shannon Kook) and a local deputy (scene-stealer John Brotherton), the Warrens then set up shop in the Perrons house with a bunch of technical equipment (recorders, cameras, booby traps) to try to capture the spirits, as well as to protect the family from mortal danger.<br/><br/>The acting by all involved is exceptional, very naturalistic, without being underplayed or too monotone. The reactions seem believable and the emotions ring true. The cinematography and camera angles really accentuate the horror moments, which are perfectly timed and placed.<br/><br/>I can't remember the last time that a horror film actually SCARED me as much as this one! There are many chilling, spine-tingling moments that made me literally shake and jump out of my seat. This is not easy to do, after having seen what seems like a MILLION horror films! Director James Wan (who previously directed the masterful and original horror film Saw 10 years prior to this film, essentially creating a new genre of horror film) went old-school with The Conjuring and fashioned a throwback, invigorating, scary horror masterpiece!"

","This was a good very suspenseful final which built up the scares by not showing the demon/ghosts upfront. A lot was left to the imagination - the best type of horror in my eyes.<br/><br/>However this was undone by the final act - it was way over the top and turned into another, indistinct, American horror movie. If you go down one route and type of horror why then change it at the end to an unbelievable stand off and fight between the protagonists.<br/><br/>America would be best to look East especially at the Tartan Film collections that have many Asian horrors- which have since been remade in the USA. In these films - sometimes frustrating, there are lose ends or where there is no final solution some lingering doubts as to the final act."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" is good film, where everything works - story, acting, directing, music, camera work and horror. And it's not easy to combine all these elements to work - we saw lots of bad examples. ""The Conjuring"" gives us usual setting - scary house where ""something"" is wrong. Aside from the fact that this is the most usual place for horror story, this movie works. First of all - acting is really good in this film - lead women did a great job. There are scary moments, but before watching this film i thought there will be more of them, nevertheless they are really good, and if you in a mood for good scares - ""The Conjuring"" can give you some truly chills. This film is a must see to all horror fans and to all movie lovers.<br/><br/>One more thought. I think that the last 3 years are golden age of horror movies in Hollywood. Think of it, in the last 3 or 4 years they produced some terrific horror pictures. The good one ""Insidious"", the amazing ""Sinister"" and now ""The Conjuring"" - these are all wonderful horror movies, equal to gems that we saw from the late 70's. I really looking forward to what comes next."
"movieboy2001","10","1","3","21 October 2013"," The Conjuring is probably one of the most compelling horror stories I've seen in awhile.
","Please check out more of my reviews on www.themovieboy77.com<br/><br/>Review: The Conjuring<br/><br/>As I sit in the theatre with my friend waiting for the movie to start, I see a bunch of teenagers walking in. I then reminisce of the times I've went to go see Horror movies, where i have a bunch of teens either laughing or talking throughout the movie. This would occur in The Conjuring, but it wouldn't be long before it would go dead silent and everybody would get lost in the story.<br/><br/>The movie begins in the early 70′s with Ed & Lorraine Warren, two paranormal investigators talking to two young ladies and a man about the ""Annabelle Case"", a case in which a doll is possessed by a young girl who was killed in the home the three are living in. I won't give the rest away. The little you know, the better of an experience it will be.<br/><br/>Next, we meet the Perron family. A happy family with no history of any demon activity until they move into their new home in Harrisville, Rhode Island. The next half hour will build up to the most terrifying story you will ever hear. Again, I don't want to give too much away.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. Lili Collins is great as Carolyn Perron. Her performance reminded me of a young Ellen Burstyn from The Exorcist. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were also great as Ed & Lorraine Warren. They showed a lot of emotion and you couldn't help but be compelled to their characters.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie, Ed Warren states ""We've been called ghost hunters. Paranormal researchers. Wackos."" in which Lorraine replies, ""But we prefer to be known simply as Ed and Lorraine Warren."" The two characters were more than just paranormal investigators. They were also parents. Their compassion for this family was the reason why you love the characters. Their willingness to help people and delicacy toward the case was just superb and wasn't played out to be some horror movie cliché. You could help but feel for every character involved.<br/><br/>The film was unlike any horror movie you'll see. It didn't depend on blood and gore or jump scares to startle you. It was just a compelling and terrifying story with some visuals that may haunt your dreams for awhile. It felt like a 70′s horror movie. One that makes you want to sleep with one eye open.<br/><br/>My only issue is the ""based on the true story"" aspect of the movie. There is a scrolling text at the beginning of the movie revealing the story of the Warrens and before the title card, there's text saying it's based on a true story. To tell a story through film, I believe there should be some sort of real life interviews or proof of the facts of the story. It'll make it feel more real and may have pulled me in more, which at the time, I thought wasn't possible but after thinking about it, I would have given this film a perfect rating if I saw some truth behind the story.<br/><br/>James Wan, director of The Conjuring, has also directed the first Saw film and Insidious, which are two different types of horror films but are still worth the watch. I recommend The Conjuring to anyone who wants a good story and great acting. It is very scary but there's something about it that just pulls you in. It makes you craving more. One thing is for sure, I will be talking about this one for awhile.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"rahul-linkinpark","7","1","3","13 October 2013"," This movie took me by surprise, I have just one word for it - Masterfully crafted !!!
","I always have this feeling that like comedy, horror genre is very subjective.To be honest,I am not a big fan of horror genre.But ironically, I really enjoyed this movie.The Conjuring is not terribly innovative, but I don't think it needed to. It's the execution that keeps everything so gripping, and I think we needed that in this suffering era of the genre.This is old school stuff, but good old school horror movie stuff.Movie that begins with the words,'The following is a true story,' I would look at that movie the way you would look at a painting and not a photograph.The Conjuring is based on a true story. I always believe if a movie is based on a true story, it can affect the viewer at many different levels. The same thing happened to me when I saw this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is set in 1971, Roger and Carolyn move into a farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island with their five daughters.During the first day, their move goes smoothly, though their dog, Sadie, refuses to enter the house, giving the viewer first impression that something is wrong with the farmhouse.Over the next several days, various instances of paranormal disturbance occur.Carolyn contacts paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren for help.While researching the history of the house, Ed and Lorraine discover that house is once belonged to an accused witch, Bathsheba, who tried to sacrifice her children to the devil and killed herself and cursed all who would take her land. After investigating the house, Ed and Lorraine conclude that house may need exorcism. So they started collecting evidence to show to the church that has authority to authorize the exorcism.Carolyn, who was earlier possessed by the spirit of witch, takes two of her daughters,and drives back to the house. Ed, Lorraine rush to the house where they find Carolyn trying to stab Christine with scissors. After subduing Carolyn, Ed decides to perform the exorcism himself, though Carolyn escapes and again attempts to kill her other daughter. Lorraine is able to temporarily distract the possessed Carolyn from killing her daughter,allowing Ed to complete the exorcism, saving Carolyn and her daughter.While watching this movie, I honestly jumped in terror more than a few times. Something that rarely happens to me.<br/><br/>Coming back to my previous statement, how I think this movie can affect you in so many different levels. This may sound like another typical ghost house plot, but this movie was so much more. The last 15 minutes of the movie dazzled me, that was the point where movie took me by surprise.The point where the Lorraine is able to distract the possessed Carolyn from killing her daughter. What I liked most is the idea how everybody stopped Carolyn to do a evil thing to her own daughter,Roger kept on screaming ""You gotta fight it. You're stronger than she (witch who possessed Carolyn's body) is.You gotta stay with us, all right? Come on back, Carolyn"". Loraine reminded her of a special memory she shared with her family (a nice day at the beach). After watching this movie, I still don't believe there is such a thing as demon but we all have evil inside all of us, we can't deny that. we just need to fight the evil inside us like Carolyn did with the help of her husband, ed and Lorraine. The evil exists. The good exists. As people we need to elect which path to follow. But whatever you choose,always remember - Hate the sin, not the sinner."

","Horror is a genre that has a way of affecting us, long after we leave for home. Unlike other genres the effect isn't positive and yet we are interested in the next horror movie knowing well what's in store. Since horror is a widely reiterated genre, very few movies stand the test of time,here is One.<br/><br/>Expectations starts to rise from the trailer onward especially if the director of SAW and INSIDIOUS is returning for his next venture. And the director has hit it right in the bull's eye.<br/><br/>The Warrens are called in for help after the Perrons find an unsettling presence in their new home. Add to this, the dog that senses ghosts, a cellar which should not have been opened, the children becoming the target, you will feel that this movie is fairly predictable. And that's where you go wrong.<br/><br/>The screenplay is so tightly knit along with some strong performances from the entire cast. The Warrens themselves have a past with demons, and as they are ready to confront their worst fears, problems rise and ultimately all hell break loose.<br/><br/>The tiniest objects hold the utmost importance in a horror movie. This one is no exception either. From the musical mirror thing to the chain of the Warrens to Mr. Warren's personal museum of cursed items, everything looks creepy and haunted (I bet, the Annabelle Doll will look right through your soul.)<br/><br/>All this leads to ultimate climax where everything that can go wrong in an exorcism goes wrong. Adding to this macabre is the fact that the exorcism is not performed by the pastor but by Mr.Warren himself.<br/><br/>Having said that, THE CONJURING is definitely worth the price of admission and a must watch for all horror fans."
"nairtejas","5","1","3","9 October 2013"," Too Feeble To Be Scary. ♦ 48%
","This is just the right theater movie material. But if you are a real horror fanatic & have been following the genre for long, The Conjuring will only disappoint you.<br/><br/>Because, the plot starts with a believable story of two sisters and how a husband-wife pair of exorcists/conjurers solve the mystery. Now, the character depth is very shallow here, telling stories in binds and thus reaching no conclusion whatsoever. Then comes the family who are threatened by a dumb spirit, who is so unbelievable that she persuades the mother of the family to kill others.. So pathetic.<br/><br/>And, the turn of events isn't justified at all. Some even seemed made- up.<br/><br/>Vera Farmiga is excellent and the guy who I last saw in Watchmen (2009) supports well. The family's performance is below average and since they were made to enact improbable situations, I wouldn't expect much. Yes, in a horror movie improbable situations are feasible, but there is a doll in here with some serious life issues who seems to only follow what the director says appearing wherever she wants to be without realizing what she's doing. How wonderful!<br/><br/>Finally, the ending is so calm, I thought it was a drama. Ranging over a fine 2 hours, it does have some moments which made my jaw drop, but then they all were referenced (from The Amityville Horror & Paranormal Activity). Cinematography & setup is par excellence and it is due to the filmmaking factors that I rate it a humble 4.8 out of 10. Although, I still am depressed with the writers for lacking originality. Sampling the much-loved exorcism with a tint of relationships & emotions does not culminate in anything.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Not recommended. I'd prefer Dark Skies (2013) over this anytime.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

","Before Christianity and Latin existed how did exorcists exorcise? A lingering question after watching The Conjuring, a film by James Wan.<br/><br/>The age of Scary Movie-esque franchises has turned seeing dead people and being haunted by and evil spirits into mundanely comic events. Sexy vampires, farcical zombies, and ridiculous inside jokes about the world's end begone! The Conjuring is a big horror film that is actually good and scary. Finally!<br/><br/>Still, Director Wan uses all the old horror tricks to build up the suspense: creeping suggestive crescendos in the score, brief uncertain glimpses of unknown beings, and of course, lots of loud and unexpected jolts.<br/><br/>The film opens as the Perron family arrives at their new home, a large fixer-upper in the Rhode Island countryside. As the family starts their life in the new house the haunting becomes apparent. Clocks stop, doors slam, people scream. Terror drives the family to huddles up in the living room where they spend their nights sleeping together. It makes the spirits calmer, they say.<br/><br/>A little too conveniently, famous demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren just so happen to be speaking nearby. Mrs. Perron persuades the Warrens to come inspect the house. Lorrain Warren, a kind of clairvoyant, senses real trouble in the Perron house immediately. Using cameras, Holy magic, and Latin scriptures, the fight begins to save not only the house from destruction, but the people inside it as well.<br/><br/>More reviews at getthebonesaw.blogspot.com"

","What is more frightful? The fact that you know you are not alone or the fact that you know that you are? Whatever rocks your boat I can assure you that once you are done with watching the James Wan fright flick ""The Conjuring"" you will keep the lights on at night if you do live alone!! <br/><br/>Based on a true a story that took place at a farm house on a 200acre land on Rhode Island back in the 70s, The Conjuring unravels an investigation done by famous demonologists Ed & Lorraine Warren on suspected paranormal activity. The tenants of the farm house, The Perron Family were warned by the previous tenant whilst moving into their new home that they should ""keep the lights on at night"". The family of 7, the parents and the 5 Daughters settled in with ease until the day of the first game of hide and clap. The spirits in the farm house did not take time to make their presence known which led Carolyn Perron to seek for help from the Ed & Lorraine Warren.<br/><br/>Media interviews with real family following the opening of the movie this summer, tells us that James Wans narration of the events are quite close to that which did take place 4 decades ago. Whilst there maybe some discrepancies which I would chalk up against being ""Hollywood"". The prevalent one of all according to the oldest daughter in the Perron family is that the movie maybe less frightful than some of the events that actually did occur. I can't begin to even fathom what went on inside that farmhouse!<br/><br/>Aussie / Malaysian director James Wan stepped into the spotlight of Hollywood with his slasher /psychological genre horror movie ""The Saw"". Although the franchise took its toll when the money hungry production houses kept expanding it with slasher after slasher, Wan was smart enough to back away and pursue other productions which were decent on its own. The Conjuring is his second Religious/Satanic genre horror attempt following Insidious which was absolutely brilliant. I must say that this is a work of art more than it is a reenactment based on true events. Wans passion of horror enables him to scare the socks off even the most hardcore of horror fans. As lovers of the genre if you have watched a fair share of such flicks by now you are good enough to anticipate the scares in any type of horror movie by carefully analyzing the story line and by having a sharp ear to the soundtrack. I missed every single one of it and I just jumped in my seat as my heart rated plummeted over and over again with unexplainable fear. As a critic this is statement may get me into trouble but I believe that The Conjuring is the best horror production that I have sat through so far. This is an absolute must watch and you will not walk away the same.<br/><br/>James Wan also does remind me of Wes Craven and how good he was when he introduced to us Freddy Krueger instantaneously scarring a massive portion of my childhood. Furthermore the attention to detail of the spirit in focus, the witch Bathsheba and her detailed visuals are as good as Cravens when he told us stories of Freddy. A tightly wound screenplay along with Wans artistry and the method used to approach and assemble The Conjuring and the detailed CGI makes it the real deal. Now that you know how first class the movie is.<br/><br/>Let me share some tips on how to best enjoy this flick.<br/><br/><ul><li>Watch it at night -Ensure there are no distractions that would make you have to push the pause button. -Do not watch a copy anything less than DVD quality. -Ensure that all lights are switched off!!!</li></ul><br/><br/>Alright folks it's your turn now.

But overall, it didn't scare a lot and that was kind of disappointing for me because I went to this movie to get scare a lot. Well, the actors in this movie did a good job though. And, I like the atmosphere. The doll though freaks me out though. Overall, if you really want to see a movie that would scare you a lot and you will have trouble sleeping, watch Sinister."
"marioandwes","8","1","3","30 August 2013"," Pretty good, not the best though.
","The Conjuring starts off as a usual horror film, embracing some age old horror film. But getting in to the scarier bits, it separates itself from your usual horror films. Overall, not to spoil the film, The Conjuring is a witty horror film, delivering some great scary moments through out. Although The Conjuring is a enjoyable film, it relies on old horror movie film ideas, particularly at the start of the film. I mean, how many times has this idea of moving in to a haunted house been done? The characters are not strong enough as well, quite unrealistic. I mean, some of the most screwed up things happen and the family are terrified, but the next day, they act completely oblivious to the previous night's horror. The film does contain very good jump scares though. Especially towards the end of the film, when the family are in the basement, before they perform the exorcism. The plot was slightly predictable to say the least. Overall, a solid film."
"andreas-hein1993","7","1","3","27 August 2013"," Another unimaginative plot. That aside, the movie was very impressive. 7/10
","As with most movies directed by the famous man behind Saw, James Wan, The Conjuring is pretty horrifying. The general mood and lighting of the movie is perfectly thrilling, and the secrecy of what is haunting the house is so brilliantly executed that you will be kept on the edge of your seat during the entire movie.<br/><br/>As for the story of the movie, it was unoriginal, and felt like you were watching the tenth remake of some paranormal activity spoof. Especially since it is less than three years ago Insidious was released, which was another movie with a VERY similar plot, also directed by James Wan. I get how this haunted house/family plot really contains room for a terrifying and thrilling story, but it is hard to understand why it has gotten so overused recently as the horror genre is known for being imaginative, unpredictable and innovative.<br/><br/>Generally this movie was really impressive. It kept a suspenseful and horrifying theme, and right from the beginning it felt as if the movie would consume you and drag you right into the middle of the action. The acting in this movie is nothing less than great, and the way the characters are portrayed is probably the best in any recent horror film. While you may once or twice think ""Why would you go in there alone?"" as in most scary movies, the characters are actually somewhat intelligent, non-skeptical and generally pretty likable.<br/><br/>Jump scares and heavy gore are not really used in this movie, and as the story progresses the suspense of fearing the unknown is more than enough to keep the viewer paralyzed as the events unfold. Keeping the audience this scared in a paranormal activity-like movie without the use of jump scares is quite a feat, unaccomplished in most recent horror movies.<br/><br/>Why should you watch this movie? If you are looking to pee your pants you are in the right place. The Conjuring is probably one of the scariest movies that has been released in the last five years. It is also one of the only recent horror movies that actually has likable characters, which is incredibly important if you want to feel as if you are inside of the film, taking part in the horrible events. However, if you have seen all the late supernatural haunted house films, and have gotten bored of the plot long ago, there are quite a few movies out there, which you should rather watch.<br/><br/>Helix' Horrible Reviews"
"kgprophet","5","1","3","25 August 2013"," No Frills Basic Scary Movie
","This is a film specifically formulated to provide the fun scares without creeping you out too much. Hardly an 'R' rated film, it uses all the basic tenets to give you the chill up your spine that you came for. But not much else. I was getting a little concerned how often horror films turn to young girls for all the very adult scares. In this case there are 5 daughters to get molested by the devil. Supposedly, all the events in this film really happened. If so, it is utterly coincidental that all the trappings necessary to make a creepy horror film are provided. The rickety old house out in the creepy looking woods. The family unable to leave the house after the hauntings begin. The vulnerable young kids. The self-slamming doors. The creepy cellar. And so on.<br/><br/>It is entirely understandable why this was released as a summer film. The pacing and the camera-work made the film approachable to mainstream audiences perhaps looking for a amusement park attraction, the haunted house ride that has a ugly old lady with smeared makeup ready to surprise you around the corner. No different than the basic tenets a summer action film provides, ""The Conjuring"" has competent acting and good storytelling.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler ahead <br/><br/>Just don't expect the obligatory extra shock at the end when the movie deceives you into thinking all is well. Or expect any greater fireworks once we get to the Exorcist vs. the Devil confrontation.<br/><br/>Minor Spoiler finished. <br/><br/>But nevertheless fulfills the necessities to get you to jump or squirm in your seat. Not a classic of the genre, but puts in the extra effort to give us the goods without making us groan."
"sim-richmond","6","1","3","25 August 2013"," A Conjuring Comment for The Conjuring
","First off, I would like to praise the producers for having a great setting for the movie. It really added to the terrifying atmosphere that a horror movie can bring out. The cinematography and special effects were good... indeed, excellent. I love it especially that I'm really a fan of movies with good camera rollings. The screen portrayals were good, but I guess they have to work a little bit on some facial expressions to add more terror on the part of the audience. The stunts were amazing and I guess was very fit for the movie.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I only gave this movie a 6 because I can't find satisfaction with the horror scenes. I haven't even felt my heartbeat go faster than normal. Yes, I consider the fact that they may not want to sugarcoat the scenes because it is based from the true case files of Warren, but I guess, that's what horror films has to be -- over acted. If you don't over act a horror movie, then it'll be plainly a reenactment.<br/><br/>Besides, the opening was not that good for me. I believe, for some cinematic effect, they added several non-significant scenes... but come on, the introduction plays a significant role for the entire movie and you have to place something in there that is significant for the plot.<br/><br/>Lastly, the musical scoring wasn't that stunning for me. I mean, there could have been more background sounds to frighten the audience since the sound effects weren't that much effective.<br/><br/>Not bad at all. Six for this movie."

The slow story-building shows their intent quickly: a crescendo in actions and fear, almost math-like.<br/><br/>Scriptwriting was efficient, actors good, it's mostly in the clichés from the movie i was disappointed. Dog weird behavior, early death, the too clever child for his own good who never tell anything to parents until too late, Reminiscent movies like The Exorcism, House, Amityville,etc... can we move forward from 20-40 years old movies and reinvent a bit horror movies?<br/><br/>Slight tongue-in-cheek sense of humor make the pill easier to swallow and few interesting ideas like the moving of spirits linked to fear of people they met instead being home-based like House.<br/><br/>An overall good movie experience, not as scary as expected but still enjoyable."

","I can't understand why this film is so overrated. There are all the stereotypes we can imagine in an horror movie: an happy family with debts caused by new home, the new home is lost in a woods land and it has an hidden cellar where bad things happened some years ago, the doll with terrible face, various poltergeist, the littlest baby-girl uses to play with an ""imaginary"" friend (obviously a ghost) and last but no least, could you realize a similar film without a politically correct exorcism? No. I was forgetting the inevitable medium and the bumping ball. Everything was so well known that I spent all the film praying for unpredictable events but I was unlucky.

","How often do you see movies nowadays that use predictable jump scares to bore you to death? If you've seen 1 you've seen them all but this movie does it right by building atmosphere and tension and being subtle.<br/><br/>It starts of a bit slow but thats how these movies should start. You get familiar with the family, the house and the Warrens. Pretty quickly things get pretty weird and the Warrens come to help. <br/><br/>From the beginning everyone involved believes in the ghosts that haunt the house. (except the sheriff but he gets convinced pretty quickly.) You don't see that in today's horror movies. There are always a few skeptical characters that annoy you to death. <br/><br/>They also don't move because 1) who could help out a family of 7 in the early 70's? and 2) the ghosts would follow them anyway. In a lot of other haunted house movies this important thing just gets left out.<br/><br/>The things that scare you in this movie are the subtle things and the ghosts are not revealed long enough to become not scary anymore and scenes where you think something is going to pop up nothing happens.<br/><br/>Most of the things that happen in this movie have been seen before but this movie does it so well that it seems refreshing.<br/><br/>The characters are likable and the whole thing is well-acted.

"third_odrazil","6","1","3","19 August 2013"," Dull with a gush of story
","Before watching this movie, there was a big fuss about it. Whether there should be a blessing from a priest after you've watched this movie or how this movie makes you sleep before 3:07 A.M., So I decided to watch it for myself.<br/><br/>The trailers were pretty much spoilers themselves, they contain the scariest scenes in the movie. So when I watched the movie, my jumps from the would-be scary scenes were gone.<br/><br/>At first, it started out as eerie and creepy about a doll who's being controlled by a demonic entity and a family extorting the demon inside of it, the Warrens, the paranormal hunters. And the Perrons, the family who moved to the haunted house.<br/><br/>The story was haunting, especially the 3:07 A.M. thing, but the movie was pretty dull. The only thing scary was the momentum of the scares. The way they plant the scary outbursts or the shocking moments paired with the sounds from hell. The DUN-DUN-DUUUUUUN with the faces of the damned.<br/><br/>If we were to talk about the visuals, it was great. Starting on how they captured the whole 70's feel. Though some might say it resembled Insidious which has the same director, but I think this story is much easier to follow. No astral dimension thingies, just plain old exorcism, witches, curses, and demonic things. The music scoring was great. Hats off to the cast who portrayed their roles well.<br/><br/>I watched it until the end and expected for a much emotionally-scarring scene to happen but I was disappointed. The only thing that scared me was this happened in real life.<br/><br/>This movie was oversold, maybe just in the Philippines, so it pretty much bummed some people after the movie was done.<br/><br/>And the result: people getting disappointed.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It was a let down from all the tension and attention it built up to. But if it hadn't built up the talks about it and I was to watch it without any knowledge whatsoever, I'd say it's a good movie.<br/><br/>If I were to rate this movie from 1-10.<br/><br/>I'd say it's a 6."
"adnan_khalid56","8","1","3","19 August 2013"," An old fashioned, scary ghost story
","The Conjuring is a great addition to the pure ghostly horror movies in the history of cinema. With gore and thrill, mutation and craze taking over the horror film genre in both Hollywood and Bollywood movie reviews have shown that the general scare factor of an average horror flick has diminished. The Conjuring brings that scary chill and delivers it right to the depth of your bones. A perfect portrayal of a ghost story with a demonic entity bent on destroying a family is what is to be expected when you decide to watch the Conjuring. As with most of our Hollywood and Bollywood movie reviews we will try to look into the production values, the acting, editing and direction of the film and give a verdict as to how we rate the film overall. The film has great production values with very scary special effects and sleek editing. The story is coherent and the direction is sharp. The cast on the whole has done a great job and created a memorable experience."
"asda-man","8","1","3","16 August 2013"," Conjured up one of this years best horror films
","Haunted house movies are really getting old, aren't they? We know all the clichés that have been done to death with creaky doors, ghosts that say ""Boo!"" in the night, dark cobweb laden cellars that often end up being dimly lit by a single match. They aren't creepy anymore and they're boring. Well, James Wan has proved this philosophy to be entirely untrue and shows that the haunted house genre is very much still alive and still effective and creepy. The Conjuring does nothing new with the genre, and although this may sound off-putting it really shouldn't be, as it still manages to be one of the best haunted house films of recent memory and quite possibly the best horror film to have come out this year (although You're Next is getting closer!) The Conjuring has a great 70's vibe to it right from the terrific opening titles that atmospherically crawl up the screen after the creepy opening involving a possessed doll. Most films that proclaim to be true stories are largely fabricated, but The Conjuring is an exception as it is based on the case files of real life investigators of the paranormal, Lorraine and Ed Warren (played brilliantly by Mr.Wilson and Miss.Farmiga). The writers had been in touch with the real Lorraine Warren during the writing process, and whilst the film has taken liberties, Lorraine proclaims the events depicted in the film to be largely true which makes the film all the more creepy.<br/><br/>I liked how the first half of the film balances the lives of the haunted Perron family and the investigative Warren family. This makes the second half of when the Warren's become involved all the more involving. Usually in these types of films (and even in James Wans' very own Insidious) the investigators are thrown in towards the end to get rid of the problem. The Conjuring feels much more authentic in this respect as we gain insight into their lives which show them as ordinary people. Of course, the Perron family moving in are of course the more interesting aspect of the first half, which is why more focus is given to them, and wisely so.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is constantly gripping thanks to the continuous scares it delivers. Unfortunately I never felt scared like I did in, say, Insidious or Sinister, but The Conjuring definitely did have one or two moments that creeped me out. James Wan is a master behind the camera and knows exactly how to conjure up (see what I did there?) suspense and a very strong creepy atmosphere. Instead of using close-ups and quick-cuts that make it impossible to see what's going on, James uses long shots that are largely in one take that are so much more effect. A scare is ultimately like a punch line to a joke, and more often than not the punch-line is scares fails to deliver, but The Conjuring does. The use of silences and sounds is also very effective indeed and especially works well in a cinema or, I would assume, with a surround sound system. I'm fairly sure that had I watched this on my own in the dark, I would've been scared.<br/><br/>One stand-out scene for me involves the mother playing ""hide and clap"" with her youngest daughter. This scene shows off James' talents to a tee and is one of the creepiest scenes in the entire film. After a slow, but never boring first half things begin to heat up more in the second half when the Warrens come in to investigate which acuminates to a thrilling finale where you really care about what happens to the characters. Some people say that the finale is a little too Hollywood, but I found it effective and thrilling within the contents of the film and it also delivered some creepy images.<br/><br/>So although The Conjuring offers nothing new, it really doesn't matter. James Wan delivers the frights so effectively that you'll feel like you've never seen anything like it before. It's old-school horror done right. However, I didn't quite like it as much as Sinister, which I found scarier or James' previous ghost story, Insidious which I also found scarier than this one. However, I was also a fan of Insidious' controversial third half, so people who disliked that about Insidious will without a doubt enjoy The Conjuring more. It's refreshing to see a genuinely creepy haunted house film as there have been so many duds such as: The Pact, Darkness and that terrible UK TV show, Lightfields that just do not know how to creep out an audience! Whilst The Conjuring may not frighten the hardest horror fans, some parts might just get under your skin. The film is well worth seeing anyway just for the wonderful directing, acting, special effects and set design. This is a very solid ghost story and I look forward to James Wan's imminent sequel to Insidious."
"davidgee","7","1","3","14 August 2013"," Better than AMITYVILLE, not up there with THE EXORCIST
","Based, the credits tell us, on a true story, the unhappy house-buying experience of the Perron family in Rhode Island is played as a serious docudrama, not as a piece of hokum, which helps to give the movie some credulity. The two female leads are particularly solid: Lili Taylor as the mother fighting to save her children and Vera Farmiga as the ghost-buster with special ""gifts"". The make-you-jump moments do what they're supposed to and look more like old-fashioned special effects than over-egged CGI.<br/><br/>There's nothing like an old-fashioned haunted-house movie. PARANORMAL ACTIVITY has decided to become another cheesy franchise. THE CONJURING is a cut above THE AMITYVILLE HORROR or the crappy 1999 remake of THE HAUNTING, but no movie is ever going to out-gross (in either sense of the word) THE EXORCIST."

Twenty minutes later, had dropped my hubby's hand and put the popcorn aside. 40 minutes in, wishing for it to end. Where was the terror? Are we in the wrong theater? I nudged my husband and he just shrugged his shoulders and yawned.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: Playing a blind-folded version of Hide and Go seek was scary due to the fact I figured someone might trip and break their neck.<br/><br/>Stay home. Turn out all the lights and go to bed. You will be more scared doing that than watching this movie."
"kmcloone96","9","1","3","9 August 2013"," Phenomenal horror brought to us by the new King of the genre
","The Conjuring opens to a long, eerie shot of a sinister looking doll, who's name we find out to be Annabelle. A short sequence revolving around this doll introduces us to the protagonists of the movie; real life paranormal investigators Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren. Ed & Lorraine travel across the country presenting their work to various universities, alongside visiting people's homes who believe that their house is the site of demonic activity, which is usually dismissed by simple logic. As advertised however, The Conjuring focuses on one case ""too disturbing to be told...until now.""<br/><br/>After a title sequence that literally made all the hairs on my neck stand up, the Perron family are introduced. Moving into a new home, everything seems normal until strange occurrences make them believe something is awry, and after many disturbances unsettle the family the Mother Carolyn (Lili Taylor) seeks out the Warrens' help. This gives us a fairly average plot on which countless terrifying moments can be built upon. <br/><br/>It's important to know that The Conjuring doesn't really try do anything new. Numerous 'haunting' movies have been released recently, but none have made me as scared as The Conjuring. Director James Wan (who also directed such films as Saw and Insidious) has such an effective method of shocking audiences with violence and terror, but The Conjuring features almost no gore or violence or foul language, it instead relies on pure fear to make you feel incredibly uneasy. Of course there are a few 'jump-scares' which have become the norm in current horror movies, but there are so many other occasions where a scene is drawn out to a painful level of tension that had me almost hiding behind my hands, all accompanied by a sinister soundtrack which adds huge amounts to the on- screen sequences.<br/><br/>In a horror movie, it is important to care about the protagonists, otherwise we don't fear for their lives when in danger. Luckily then, actors such as Patrick Wilson and Lili Taylor portray their characters to such an exceptional degree that they are so likable I didn't want anything bad to happen to them, which is a foolish thing to hope for in a movie like this, but something they should be commended for. <br/><br/>My only real negative with the movie is that towards the end, a lot of things are revealed which may have been more effective if left to the imagination. Maybe it's just me, but I find things to be a lot scarier when a face is not put to whatever it is haunting a family. Small glimpses are caught of the apparition throughout, and in my opinion it should have remained at that."

It is just the same as every other horror out there.

That would have been scarier.<br/><br/>I came to the cinema expecting to need a change of underwear but came out feeling let down and wanting to regain 2 hours of my life I just wasted (or how ever long the film was, it felt like it was that long).<br/><br/>Like I said, I've seen a lot worse but I have seen much, much better.<br/><br/>The worst part is, it comes from the makers of fantastic films like Insidious and Saw... they downgraded a little."

","Saw The Conjuring last night. It's a movie I've looked forward to for some time. I was somewhat familiar with Ed and Lorraine Warren and the IMDb reviews on the film have been superb. So...does it live up to expectation? Well that depends entirely on what your expectations are...if you are hoping for an Amityville Horror, Haunting in Connecticut, Poltergiest, straight up, bump in the night, haunted house movie...then you wont be disappointed. It certainly deserves it's place on that top ten list. If however, you like horror movies that drag you into the dark rather than using it as a cover for spooks, those psychological gems such as The Exorcist, Silence of the Lambs, The Omen, then The Conjuring will disappoint greatly. If you look back on The Exorcist...it would be hard to imagine anyone replacing Jason Miller as Damian Karras and that's because we understood him so well that Miller WAS Karras. The same could be said for Max Von Sydow as Fr Merrin or Ellen Burstyn as Chris McNeill and even Lee J Cobb as Bill Kinderman. We even got under the surface of Pazuzu, the demon.<br/><br/>Demon: What an excellent day for an exorcism. Father Damien Karras: You would like that? Demon: Intensely. Father Damien Karras: But wouldn't that drive you out of Regan? Demon: It would bring us together. Father Damien Karras: You and Regan? Demon: You and us.<br/><br/>Demon: Mirabile dictu, don't you agree? Father Damien Karras: You speak Latin? Demon: Ego te absolvo. Father Damien Karras: Quod nomen mihi est? Demon: Bon Jour. Father Damien Karras: Quod nomen mihi est? Demon:La plume de ma tante.<br/><br/>The Conjuring also deals with issues of possession and the manipulation of a child, but this spirit isn't Captain Howdie and this movie isn't The Exorcist (1973)...or The Omen (1976) or The Changeling (1980) and therein lies the problem. In the 70s, it wasn't the kiss of death to make a horror movie with an 18 cert and evil could be examined as a study. Now, it's one bloody puke and you're a slave of Satan....one touching memory later and you're free from his shackles. Horror by the numbers. When audiences first sat through The Exorcist, they wanted to run from the cinema and splash their face in holy water...the only time I was on the edge of my seat during The Conjuring was when I contemplated popping out for a coffee. Along with The Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Possessed, The Rite and three decades of drivel, this was another opportunity wasted. William Friedkin/William Peter Blatty where the hell are you???"

It's ""based"" on a true story, but much of the story hails from The Warrens who are also the same paranormal investigators that spun the supposed true story of Amityville Horror. Sure, you could say some of it may be based on true events, but as a film it's totally recycled. It's all been done before. I suppose for a younger generation, this might seem new and exciting, but if you're 35 or older and have grown up with any of the above mentioned classic horror flicks in your memory bank, then you probably can skip this one. It had a couple of good jumps and scares, but other than that, it was totally dry and unoriginal. I'm so sick of movie studios churning out crap."

","""The Conjuring"" is actually one of the better haunting movies that has been released in the past many years, far surpassing those ""Paranormal Activity"" in every way (especially as this is not a 'found footage' mockumentary).<br/><br/>The movie is about the Perron family who move into an old house in a rather idyllic verdant setting. But it doesn't take long before things start to happen; odd sounds and minor things happening around the house. But these quickly escalate into something horrible and the family have to seek out the Warrens to help them investigate into the strange happenings that is taking place in their house.<br/><br/>The storyline is nicely composed, quickly establishing solid characters and building up a sense of suspense that quickly turns into dread. The movie does make good use of lighting, environment and shock effects to scare the audience.<br/><br/>The poster brandishes ""based upon the true case files of the Warrens"", well, as much as I do believe in the supernatural, these events here were just a bit too out there. But still, it made for some rather good movie entertainment.<br/><br/>As for the people hired to play the various roles, then I will say that they all did good jobs with their given characters and roles, and everyone contributed something to their characters and to the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>The movie is quick to get into gear and stays in high gear all towards the end. And speaking of the end, I am not particularly fond of those kind of happy Hollywood endings, but hey, it is a crowd pleaser. And the ending is one such that you see coming a mile away - unfortunately.<br/><br/>Ultimately, if you like ghost, haunting and possession movies, then ""The Conjuring"" is definitely a movie that you don't want to miss out on, as it is one of the better of this particular genre to have graced the screen in the last couple of years.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" gets a well-deserved 7 out of 10 rating from me."

","this is my 1st time writing a review but i had to because i did not get all the hype,i read a lot of reviews going on about how scary this film was but i must have watched another film,i have seen lots of horror films from all Japanese,Korean and USA etc and i have to say the USA are the worst at making horror movies,the ghosts looked really weak,the scenes that are SUPPOSED to make you jump are so predictable,also like all USA horror its as though the writers got fed up writing near the end of the script,proper USA happy go lucky ending,the acting is strong by all actors which kept me watching but i felt like i was robbed of £9,if anyone wants a good edge of seat,gasping for air,goose bumps this isn't the film,i would say REC REC2(the Spanish versions not the USA remake) and a Korean film called R-POINT"

"visheshvijay","8","1","3","3 August 2013"," Real Fear Factor after a long time
","The problem with most modern horror films is that they've stopped trying to scare you; they want to gross you out instead with elaborate and explicit torture and killings. The Saw franchise, and even the repugnant Human Centipede movies seem to pride themselves on just how many times you have to turn away in sheer disgust at what's unfolding on screen. It takes a film as old fashioned and as classically structured as The Conjuring to remind us that it's the little things that can deliver the biggest scares.Claiming to be based on a true-life story, the film stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as married couple Ed and Lorraine Warren, a pair of ghostbusters renowned for their extensive research on the supernatural, and for the success they've had ferreting out spirits from where they don't belong. In 1971, they're recruited by Roger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor), who, after moving into their new home in Rhode Island, find themselves and their five daughters being terrorized by strange smells, unexplained bruises, and visions of dead people.Director James Wan, who gave us the first Saw film, uses the camera niftily to create an eerie sense of foreboding, and employs music and sound effects shrewdly to heighten the shock. It's true we've seen creaking floorboards and dusty basements a thousand times before, but he knows just how to exploit them for maximum effect. I'm not easily scared, but more than once during The Conjuring I found myself jumping in my seat.The film also works because there's a level of acting here that's rarely seen in films like this. Lili Taylor cuts a sympathetic figure as a helpless mother, and Vera Farmiga is nothing short of terrific as a woman whose special abilities make her both powerful and vulnerable. Sure the last half hour feels heavily borrowed from The Exorcist and Poltergeist, but it's all done with such style, you'll forget you've seen it before.I'm going with eight ratings for The Conjuring. It's a nice throwback to the moody horror films of the 70s. Wear long sleeves when you go to the cinema, or you risk your date digging her nails into your arm."

","First thing you notice with this film is that its based on true events, now you think here that OK its just a made up story for entertainment for shock & horror value for a horror film.<br/><br/>Well you would be wrong, This is was a investigation that has never been told to media or anyone until now because of the Amityville haunting, this film is truly based on an investigation of a family that was haunted by some evil force when they moved in back in the 70s which also lends to one of the most famous paranormal investigation of the Amityville house haunting & a few other haunting in the area. Vera Farmiga & Patrick Wilson portray two of the worlds famous paranormal investigator's Lorraine Warren & Ed Warren which you can Google them they have done a lot of paranormal investigation through their life some of which were the most frightening to them.<br/><br/>This film I kid you not is not for the faith hearted, it is one of the most spin chilling, disturbing horror films your ever see, that really insight your fear of the dark.it refreshing to see a horror film exactly scare the living hell out of you for once.

"kieranwyatts","Null","1","3","2 August 2013"," Every great horror cliché - but in a good way...
","I have just watched ""The Conjuring"" in a fairly deserted screening, with popcorn in toe I was ready for a good ride and this film did not disappoint. From the chilling first scene and opening credits to the final gut wrenching hurrah ""The Conjuring"" is a thoroughly entertaining trip down well tread horror moments. Although the picture is packed to the brim with clichés and takes a lot of great hints from other classical of the genre, despite this, each cliché is executed well and occasional gets a good scare.<br/><br/>Apparently based on a true story ""The Conjuring"" follows the Warrens; Ed and Lorraine, as they embark on the most disturbing case of their ghost hunting carriers. This case was apparently so scary that it is only coming to light now. Ed and Lorraine specialise in driving the daemons that possess your house away. However, a previous case had lead Ed to believe that his wife may not be up to it. The clairvoyant Lorraine see things that others can't be it a nice day at the beach or a horrific hanging. Meanwhile, the Perrons are moving into their new home, quickly however, things start to take a darker turn. The family begin to hear bumps in the night and discordant chimes from the basement. Their only option is to find the Warrens and convince them to rid the house of evil; but can the Warrens rid the house of dread and save the family from their demise?<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" is very enjoyable. Although it may be sporadically scary rather than constantly on the edge of your seat it is still a lot of fun. Also, for me it was refreshing to be scared without any of the modern tropes that seem to follow modern horror around; found footage, gore and stupid teens. This new movie takes its marks from classics. The title card is basically from ""The Exorcist"" however, the blood red is replaced with a sickly yellow. The central characters and narrative centre around children and their connection with the afterlife, although this is not obvious in ""The Shining"" it still plays a large role and ""The Conjuring"" seems to play off this fear of children well. That is not to say that this film is just a rip off, no, there are some genuinely frightening scares and some original moments. There just seemed to be something about the setting and characters that reminded me of a lot of other films; ""The Conjuring"" is set in the mists of the seventies and it shows perfectly in the costumes and sets. A lot of people have already hailed this movie as a future great and although it is great I can't see people watching this in fifty years........ <br/><br/>For the rest of the review visit kierankingfilm.blogspot.co.uk"

"npham54-754-347632","8","1","3","2 August 2013"," It's been a while for a genuine ""horror"" movie!
","Man, was I glad to have watched this in the movie theater and not passing it up like I should have done on many a ""horror"" movies in recent times. This movie creates an terrifyingly suspenseful atmosphere nearly throughout the whole film. It's hard to find a film that will literally make you feel afraid to go to sleep the night you watched it and give you the creeps when you think about it afterward. Even when you know something is going to happen, this movie will scare the crap out of you! It's not like those retarded movies where there's always something around the corner that makes you jump like a Mexican jumping bean. That is not in anyway a definition of a horror film. There's no or very convincing CG effects that don't detract from the film. It uses genuine elements like music, shot angles, and plain old school truly artistic make-up talents to make this one a winner. <br/><br/>I see a bunch of people writing that they could've done better? Yeah probably on the Sci-Fi channel and even then they probably couldn't even make a Z-Rated movie. If you gotta nit-pick at every little thing in every movie made, you might as well not watch anything and live in your own imaginations. Or better yet, go read a book and be happy with what your own mind comes up with. The intent of a movie is to take you away from it all and into the world that they've created. This movie has done it pretty damn well. There's not tons of gore or anything like Evil Dead. <br/><br/>Don't pass the opportunity to see this movie in the theater. It won't feel the same if you wait till the DVD/Blu-Ray release. Even then I'm still sure this will scare the hell out of you. Without a doubt I'll be owning a Blu-Ray version of this movie to add to my collection with movies like, Silent Hill, Exorcist, Ju-On & The Grude, etc."
"batista_fan","5","1","3","30 July 2013"," Just an average horror film
","I went to this movie with high expectations and was given a jump scare fest. <br/><br/>My problems with this movie started in the beginning. The first 30-45 minutes of this film were so boring and mind numbing it was inexplicable. The gaps between each and every jump scare were too long, and the majority of the film I wasn't feeling a creepy atmosphere. Until the last 30 minutes of the film when the mother was possessed. <br/><br/>The plot was a cliché in terms of horror films. We have all seen the way Paranormal Activity turned out, and like The Conjuring both films are predicated on purely jump scares and lacked a truly scary atmosphere. <br/><br/>And every scare is so predictable, we are given most of the scares that are in this movie in the trailers, plus they amp the music up prior to every scare, so you know when each scare is happening.<br/><br/>Like a lot of horror films the people were absolutely stupid. What kind of people buy a house without researching the history of previous owners? If they simply looked into this their situation with the demonic spirits would never have happened. <br/><br/>At the end of the day if you are willing to spend 11 dollars to jump a couple times and you fear ghosts, this is your movie."

The cinematography, brilliant. The acting, excellent. The effects (for what there was), fantastic. Very rarely do I get the chills from a paranormal film, but damn, The Conjuring gave me so many goosebumps!<br/><br/>I absolutely LOVE James Wan and all of his works. The man is a GENIUS. GREAT job on this film!<br/><br/>In short, The Conjuring, to me, is worth repeated viewings at the theater and be worth every penny, every time.

"truynkeesfn","9","1","3","30 July 2013"," 2013 has produced Quality, not Quantity, and this is proof
","Horror has a 'new' master in James Wan. I say 'new' because Wan is no rookie when it comes to the horror genre, yet I feel lots of people, because of 'The Conjuring', will really start to take an interest in him and his work. Between 'Evil Dead' and 'The Conjuring', 2013 has proved that 1st person horror is not the only type of horror that can truly scare. In 'The Conjuring', we are told a suspense tale that takes the viewer on a horror/thrill ride for the ages. The film has constant scares start-to-finish without forcing cheap scares on the audience. All of the pop-up scares are completely story-building and lead to the big picture. Also, a great thing this film does, without giving anything away, is not waste more than half of the movie with a character who denies anything supernatural is occurring. It is accepted that something horrible is actually occurring and Wan doesn't make the audience hate one particular character by making them seem completely ignorant to their surroundings.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a hardcore horror fan to love this film. All the acting is on-point, believable and they really connect with the audience. Anyone who loves a great thriller and doesn't mind sleeping with the lights on will absolutely have to add this to their must-see list. James Wan and 'The Conjuring' set the new standard for the horror genre and will both be talked about for their contribution to the film world for years to come."
"macedoniall","7","1","3","30 July 2013"," Not the best horror movie in 30 years but it is a push in the right direction
","Every time a new horror movie comes out it is either labelled as a) based on a true story or b) the scariest film in thirty years I am sorry but although this is actually somewhat based on a true story it is not the scariest movie in thirty years, that belongs to a different film entirely but it's all a matter of opinion and we are here to talk about the Conjuring. There is no need to talk about the plot because I am sure you have heard/seen it hundreds of times already (especially within the last five years) What the Conjuring does do effectively is spin a fine tale of horror something that most horror movies these days have forgotten to do. The characters that inhabit this god forsaken house are the pillar to what will make the movie work for anyone going to see it, if they fall flat then you will most likely not care.<br/><br/>Most of the scares are things you have seen before but that is to be expected since this movie has been done hundreds of times just under a different coat of paint.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is a step in the right direction for the genre for now and is a better piece than Insidious. James Wan can film anything and make it look beautiful and is able to weave a sense of dread from the moment the movie starts.<br/><br/>Go see it for yourself instead of watching any trailers (really don't watch them they spoiled the movie) its not that scary but it is some good entertainment for a summer horror flick."
"Tommygl1918","7","1","3","29 July 2013"," Great Authentic ""Based On True Story"" Movie
","I really enjoy watching most movies that state ""Based On a True Story"" and as we all know most are not or are mostly Hollywood and falls off the path of keeping the story realistic. This one was nailed out of the park. James hit this one right on the head, no gore, bloody horror, fake prosthetics or bad makeup, or crappy CGI. Lilly Taylor said in an interview that James didn't use any CGI and I can see why... he didn't need to. I liked the classic/ simple horror touch to it, the more innocent thrillers that keep you more scared because of the suspense. Very well shot, great cinematography, and kept the audience from saying that was fake or corny. As for the over rated or played out ""This movie was so Scary I had nightmares, or peed myself, or cried... well... Not so much. I guess that goes to show don't read to many reviews or take them to seriously before you go and watch it for yourself. It was pretty thrilling and suspenseful, I wasn't bored or was already 3 guesses ahead of what was going to happen because the story line was so great. <br/><br/>So all in all, Very Great acting from Patrick, Vera, and Lilly. Good classic scary movie with a solid and suspenseful story line that had you pined in you seat. Worth seeing it in the theater and spending a few bucks. I didn't leave the theater saying that wasn't worth it and ""It was okay, or it sucked."" Just not as scary or horrifying as proclaimed."

"zactac","10","1","3","23 July 2013"," Reminds you that a creaky door can still be scary.
","It has been a long time since a truly terrifying film has come out. While I do think ""Insidious"" is a nice scary treat for haunted house stories, ""The Conjuring"" blew me away.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" is based on the true story (then again, Hollywood would say a movie about talking toys is based on a true story if it sold more tickets) of a family haunted by some unknown entity in the new home they got. The film is based off an old case-file investigated by Ed and Lorraine Warren, the real-life married couple who investigated the Amityville Horror. However, unlike other films based off their exploits, we get a film where they're actually main characters. So now it is up to the Warrens to help save the day for this family of seven.<br/><br/>Something else that is very surprising about this film is that it actually makes you CARE about the characters. Most of the time in horror movies you have to deal some dumb kids having sex before Jason Myers or Michael Voorhees comes along and puts an end to our misery. However, that isn't the case with ""The Conjuring."" Vera Farmiga gives a fantastic performance as Lorraine Warren, a woman who won't let anything get in the way of protecting her family or doing what is right. Patrick Wilson also gives a great performance as Ed Warren, a man who would do anything to protect his wife. Lili Taylor also gives a fantastic performance as a mother trying to protect her family. Basically what I'm trying to say is this is a horror movie with great acting! I know, I was shocked too.<br/><br/>Now James Wan has truly grown since his days directing ""Saw."" There is little to no gore in this movie, just pure terror. Wan makes you care about the characters before beginning the truly scary stuff. After all, Wan is under the insane notion that things could be scarier if we actually care about what happens to the people in this movie. I wonder where he got that idea? <br/><br/>No matter how much you prepare yourself, however, you will never be ready for the mounting dread that will haunt you from the beginning of the film. From the very first shot to the last moment you will be on the edge of your seat wanting to yell at the screen ""Hurry up I can't take the tension anymore!"" But you will take the tension because that is what this movie does. It builds the tension to the absolute highest and scares you to the point of screaming way out loud. There may be a couple jump scares here and there but the true money is when James Wan decides to show you what real fear is. Sure it might not bring anything new to the genre but it does remind you why classic horror is always the way to go. Wan proves that not all the blood in the world can outmatch a good olé fashioned creaky door in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>In the end, ""The Conjuring"" is an extremely well done film with a great cast, fantastic direction, and clever script. You will be jumping out of your seat one scene after another. Just pray that the creaky door at night is just because it needs to be oiled."

","The Conjuring is just good entertainment. I wouldn't take it as a true story any more than I would the Lone Ranger or Star Trek. I didn't go to the theater for a history lesson or a soul-enlightening sermon (even though it was Sunday). I didn't go to catch up on the latest fashion news or celebrity gossip. I went to the theater to be entertained, to escape from reality for an hour or two. <br/><br/>This evening I planned on being scared.

","James Wan is a very good director, capable of carrying out an atmospheric piece, with a solid understanding of his material to put us right in the middle of the action and let us have a relatively good time.<br/><br/>Here is a real-life story of a family haunted by evil spirits. The question is whether they will be able to survive the ordeal, and why is this case so special to a couple o the best demonologists in the United States in 1971? We do find out after a tight exposition in which little by little the family suffers through different manifestations of the evil entity. The young girls are tormented every night as the clock stops at exactly 3:07 a.m., and soon, their mother is plagued by a series of physical ailments that can be tied to nothing good. The crisis intensifies as children disappear, and the spirits of the ghosts start manifesting themselves in terrifying ways.<br/><br/>With the help of excellent art decoration, we are surrounded by a house that looks like it has lived through some serious demonic occupation. It looks damaged, destroyed, tired, in addition to terribly scary. You know anyone with some common sense should stay from it, and we start wondering why it is that these people do not remove themselves soon enough. They get their first warning as one of their family members is attacked earlier in the film, but through a logical but quite so understandable excuse, they are forced to stay.<br/><br/>Everyone actor in the movie is wonderful. With Lily Taylor playing a nonsensical but loving mother who sees her world shatter slowly and painfully, as each of her beautiful daughters is exposed to more psychological and physical torture. The apparition themselves help enhance the mood, as we see decay and destruction, and soon, with the help of some research, we learn the origin of all these ghosts and their reasons for causing such havoc.<br/><br/>In the last third of the movie, the film takes on some spiritual and religious overtones, and it will all depend on how you view these themes, but you are bound to be compelled to look at the fight with good and evil, and it is quite remarkable how much new special effects can simulate realism of this type. The exorcism in the last part of the film is violent and quite intimidating. This is no quite ""The Exorcist"" a perfect blend of different genres and almost letter perfect direction and craftmanship, but it reaches high and delivers some good and strong old fashioned thrills and chills."
"MannyTheMovieMan","8","1","3","22 July 2013"," Strong horror
","Following his first rate work on the terrific Insidious, director James Wan takes on the alleged true story of the Perron family haunting of Rhode Island told from the perspective of the ghost hunters involved, Ed and Lorraine Warren. The film may not add much that's new to the genre but it's so strikingly well made on every level that it sets it apart from other standard haunted house/demon Possession flicks. Most of the credit goes to Wan who understands pace and atmosphere and it's importance in creating suspense. The screenplay wisely fleshes out the characters enabling audiences to care about their faith. Coupled with the excellent performances by Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga and especially the always flawless Lili Taylor in the movie's most challenging role. There are some half baked supporting characters and some leaps in believability in the true story department but these small incongruities don't detract from the whole experience. This is a strong horror film made with a lot of care and respect for its subject. There's intelligence behind the scares here and a revitalization of mood and style over unnecessary gore and tired clichés."

","This movie was great. There are only three things that need to be said about this movie. <br/><br/>1. It was scary - The suspense was built up beautifully. It began with a nice little teaser showing you how crazy it was going to get and then they brought it down and let it slowly build up to when that crazy bitch jumps off the Narnia cupboard and scared the crap out of me. I don't believe in demons but if I did, I would be sleeping with the light on tonight. <br/><br/>2. The acting and character motivations were all very good - I had no problems with anyone, except the cop. What the heck was he doing there? His entire arc was ""Pft, probably just a draft"" to ""Okay, it wasn't a draft"". Geez, could have used his paycheck to feed some starving kids but whatever. The girls were really good. That Patrick guy is good as ever. Lady from that ""Psycho"" show was okay. <br/><br/>3. The directing was freaking top notch. The cinematography for this film was incredible. In fact, it was so good that when I left the theater I kept using the word ""amazeballs"" to describe some of the shots. I never use that word. I don't even know what it means. But goddanggit, James Wan knows how to shoot a scene. BOOM, steadicam shot through the house to orientate the viewer and let us know where everything is. BAM, upside down show while looking under the bed to freak the viewer out because who the hell would ever do that but damn, that's what the camera is doing so sit down and enjoy crapping yourself. KAPOWWY! shooting scenes with only a match as a source of light. Who the hell do you think you are!? Barry Lyndon? Neil Armstrong? What the hell am I even talking about anymore? I don't know because this was actually a good horror film. <br/><br/>Nuff said. <br/><br/>I gave it 8 out of 10 because I thought the Warrens were a tad bit cheesy and they filmmakers tried using cheap tricks to get us to sympathize with them instead of actually doing the work like they did with the main family. <br/><br/>Also it got to be a little much at the end when the chair was floating and stuff, i was like, ""Come on."" Also, did we really need that dog? You made my wife almost cry and I gots to deal with that crap, not you, so stop it. Stop it. <br/><br/>Okay, anyways, go see it. It's scurrrrry."

If multiple birds fly full speed into your house, breaking their necks, it's time to move out.<br/><br/>5. If your daughter discovers an antique toy that carries around as she talks to her new imaginary friend ... it's time to move out.<br/><br/>6. If, over two consecutive evenings, your sleepwalking daughter bangs her head into the armoire left by the previous owners, it's time to move out.<br/><br/>7. Having 5 daughters seems to make parenting exceptionally difficult. This is no reason to move out of the house.<br/><br/>8. Playing blindfolded 'Hide and Clap' is not an appropriate game when you live in a 3 level home. This is no reason to move out, just find a game that doesn't require a blindfold.<br/><br/>9. If you ever have to call demonologists to your home, there is no need to get defensive about not being a religious family. Just move out of the house.<br/><br/>Director Wan gives us tastes of the haunted house/possession Big 3: The Exorcist, Poltergeist and Amityville Horror. It's not at the level of these, but it's certainly better than most horror films of the past two decades ... at least we don't get any stupid teenagers wandering through the woods. In fact, this one plays right off our natural tendency to feel safe and secure while surrounded by our family within the confines of our own home. The biggest scares come from the moments we are most relaxed.<br/><br/>There are no spinning heads or pea soup, and the gore factor is exceptionally low considering Mr. Wan directed Saw, the film that kicked off torture-fest movie genre. The acting here is really good for a horror film. Patrick Wilson also starred in Wan's Insidious, and here he plays Ed Warren. With his clairvoyant wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga), the Warrens are well known ghostbusters, ghost hunters, demonologists, or whatever label you care to apply. We learn about their most famous case regarding Annaelle the doll, and we also see how they save a trophy from each of their cases ... and store it in their home (a seemingly dumb move). Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston are also strong in their roles as the Perron parents. Another thing I liked was that the kids seem like real kids ... especially the recognizable Joey King and MacKenzie Foy.<br/><br/>Horror and Comedy are both at the mercy of personal taste. It takes talent to direct a horror movie and not really introduce any new ""gotcha's"", but still keep the viewers grabbing the armrests. So enjoy the jumps, cover your eyes, and keep in mind ... if your dog won't enter your new house, it's time to move out!"

The acting is convincing and it reminded me of The Others, Amityville Horror, The Exorcist (although not up to that level) and Poltergeist.<br/><br/>Great casting and clever sound engineering. The set designer who picked that house with the cracked plaster and dirty walls, haunting tree by the lake, squeaky floors, old plumbing - good job. This is a very spooky film!"
"oscartorres0813","10","1","3","19 July 2013"," First Horror Movie To Scare Me In YEARS
","Let me start off by saying that I've seen a big amount of horror films. The last one I remember keeping me up all night was Bride of Chucky when I was 6 years old. After that, horror films just weren't as scary and actually became stupid, silly entertainment. While horror-comedy has become the norm for horror nowadays, it was great to go in with high expectations and from the very creepy first scene into every single scene following, I found myself more and more creeped out and by the climax I was actually scared for the first time in a very long time watching a horror film. James Wan is an excellent director and is able to deliver a fantastic horror film. Does it really deliver anything new to the table of horror, No. Does it feel familiar at certain points to other films, Yes. The movie works because it knows it's supposed to be an old school straight horror film and it comes at you fast and intense and while it has that ""build up"" that we've come to expect from horror movies, the build up is very suspenseful and the movie excellently avoids having cliché and stupid characters. Great acting throughout really helps and while admittedly, being predictable at certain points, it is still very fun and scary. I highly recommend this film to any horror movie fan and can not wait for the next movie James Wan will be releasing."

"jesse-hitzroth","7","1","3","19 July 2013"," A modern throwback to classic horror.
","It's been a relatively weak year so far for horror films. The Conjuring has been on my radar now though for awhile, and one of my most anticipated movies of the summer. Not to mention all the hype and positive reviews it has been getting. Director James Wan is back behind the directors chair after the successful horror film Insidious. Clearly this man loves horror films and has such a gift for setting up scares and tension. Something this genre really lacks. James Wan in my opinion is one of the best things to happen to modern horror. So does The Conjuring hold up to all the hype? The short answer is yes and no. This film to me seemed to be a mix up of insidious mixed with a dash of dead silence and the exorcist. The Conjuring takes it's time and slowly builds up tension. The scenes are set up great, and a lot of tension is felt. The problem however that while the tension is often high, the scares tend to be predictable mostly, and less effective then in the film Insidious. The two films are comparable in terms of scares however I thought Insidious was more effective on scares. With that being said however, The Conjuring seems to be a lot more focused and consistent throughout the entire film. It is a good film, however there are no new tricks here. We have seen this movie before, however director James Wan has a few tricks up his sleeve, and can create great build up. The Conjuring falters a little bit at the end, and tends to get a little cheesy and perhaps a tad overboard. Where as in Insidious it felt more in place (however some will disagree). Bottom line is this is one of the better horror films to come out in the past little bit. It offers nothing new but is a great throwback to older horror films. It's best too not watch the trailer and go into this film without knowing much. Casual horror fans will love this, but horror veterans may not fully buy into the hype. Not overly scary, but none the less a solid horror flick. Hopefully James Wan can continue his hot streak with Insidious chapter 2 in the fall. Rating: 7 out of 10."

","The Conjuring (2013): Dir: James Wan / Cast: Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Ron Livingston, Lili Taylor, Joey King: One of the best horror films in years. It regards facing evil as a married couple professed as Christians and paranormal investigators are sought to investigate a disturbance at a home featuring five daughters. It opens in 1968 with a closed case regarding an evil doll. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play Ed and Lorraine Warren paranormal experts. Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor play a married couple disturbed when clocks stop at 3:07 AM as well as various loud noises. The children report being jerked out of bed by a demonic force as well as one sleepwalking incident. Familiar elements include the family pet that meets a nasty end. It also makes no sense for anyone to play hide and seek on a top floor when safety issues are a factor. It also never explores the outside lives of the children or the profession of the husband. At any rate director James Wan creates a film even scarier than his Saw or Insidious. Wilson and Farmiga are terrific as the paranormal experts. Farmiga in particular had a close call with their last case, which has her husband worried. Taylor wakes up with bruises and eventually is threatened with possession after a frightening incident in the basement. Joey King plays the young daughter who is more than aware of the things that go bump in the night. Well written terror that finally does what so many recent horror films failed to do. It triumphantly presents a victory for good over evil and prevails or conjures up the reality of the positive. Score: 9 / 10"

","In the last few months I've sat through 'Drag Me To Hell', 'Insidious' and now 'The Conjuring' and in all three cases they were more amusing than terrifying. To say The Conjuring is formulaic is the understatement of the decade.<br/><br/>Recipe to make a haunted house movie.<br/><br/>One all American family moving into a house in the middle of nowhere. One creepy child's doll. One creepy music box. One boarded up cellar. One piano that plays by itself. One younger child who suddenly has an invisible friend. One dog that refuses to enter the house as it senses something evil within. One old clock with a booming chime. Several creaking doors opening and closing at random.<br/><br/>Then add to the above spook hunters with a Scooby Doo type Volkswagen camper van and you have The Conjuring. Possibly the most clichéd movie ever inflicted on the masses.<br/><br/>There's even a TV showing just static (Poltergeist) and the house being attacked by birds (thank you Mr Hitchcock). Plus an exorcism scene that pales in comparison with the genre topping classic The Exorcist.<br/><br/>If you asked an adolescent horror buff to right a spooky haunted house movie this would be it. I laughed heartily all the way through.<br/><br/>The fact that they try to justify this tosh by claiming it's a true story just adds insult to injury. I'd forgive the claim of authenticity if it was a good film, but it isn't. The equally hyped (as a true story) Entity was a far better movie but if you want to watch a film where you could actually believe why the haunting is happening and therefore are genuinely creeped out, watch The Innocents from 1961.

Maybe I've seen a horror movie without any sexual material (no any nude scenes or sex scenes or any such language) for the first time.

The presentation was in chronicle order, the flashbacks would have been spoiled the movie's rhythm, so we must hail the director Wan for that. Yet! another disappointment for me because it was one more horror movie that did not scare me at all. It tells, that is why I am not good at the horror genre. Not because of that I don't believe in negative forces but I like movies like 'Drag me to Hell' and old 'Evil Dead' kinda themes.<br/><br/>The positive from the movie was the performances from all. They said it was based on a true story and that is the other top more favour the movie had in its success.

"mecheart","4","1","4","9 August 2013"," Potential for memorable horror achievement without the ghost busting duo ...
","'The Conjuring' is not a bad film throughout, however it fails to stand shoulder to shoulder as it tries to do with similar, superior predecessors of the haunted house sub genre. Director James Wan and writers Chad and Carey Hayes have conjured us up a fright flick in the vein of such cult classics as 'The Legend of Hell House', 'The Amityville Horror', 'Poltertgeist' and others.<br/><br/>Had the script not attempted to so obdurately, obviously imitate the aforementioned much more groundbreaking examples of haunted house cinema, the objective horror fan might readily have judged the result on its own merits. Such is not the case however, due to its overall composition leaving no choice but to compare away 'The Conjuring' to much better similar films which preceded it's release.<br/><br/>The film is set in the early seventies which serves to lend it somehow a more gritty, darker tone overall almost as if the beginning of that decade - from where this reviewer also hails - was some bygone dark age where shadows licked hungrily at the mind, and the creak of a floor board in the middle of the night conjured night terrors of the dead fresh up from their open graves. The period setting sets up a powerfully dim feel to the movie a modern setting simply cannot achieve. Period dress, music and clothing also inspired nostalgia which will draw in many viewers who remember that era.<br/><br/>However, the period setting also brings to mind several of the similar haunted house films I've listed above also set around the same decade, and that definitely detracts from the potency of 'The Conjuring' as once again the viewer cannot avoid comparison - provided he or she has seen those other movies.<br/><br/>The film follows two separate groups of characters who lead very different lifestyles. The Perrons are a rather normal middle class couple working hard to support a large family when they move into a spacious turn of the century American Gothic farmhouse to start a new life in the Rhode Island countryside. Their story is very easy to identify with. Carolyn is a housewife and mother of five daughters, Roger is a long haul truck driver whose work keeps him on the road several days each week. Together the actors who portray them do so convincingly and the window the film provides us into their lives is comforting and enjoyable to watch them through.<br/><br/>The Warrens, who represent the other group followed by the script, Ed and Lorraine, are much more difficult to identify with and their profession in the context of the film requires some serious suspension of disbelief to avoid viewing as humorous, or worse - as a clumsy Hollywood creation. The Warrens are special paranormal investigators who at first seem to be in the business of debunking the hauntings they are hired to solve. We learn that Lorraine is ""sensitive"" to the supernatural, while Ed is the only non-clergyman outside the Church sanctioned to be titled demonologist. The introduction to their dynamic duo is borderline cheesy, and their ""work"" very quickly becomes cringe worthy for the serious horror fan.<br/><br/>As haunted house movies go, 'The Conjuring' weaves a capable visual and contextual story with the potential to frighten the audience more readily than any other recent, similar genre example. Ed Perron must leave his family to go out on the road just as the newly kindled darkness with the old new house sharpens its claws. We experience genuine building tension and terror with Carolyn and her daughters as their joy of settling into a new home unhinges into the realm of dread and animal fear.<br/><br/>Had 'The Conjuring' solely followed an account of the Perron family's terrifying experience in that big ancient house, this reviewer would have rated it a grateful eight stars out of ten. Regrettably, the writers chose instead to duct tape on a pair of ghost hunters, the extremely difficult to believe aspects of their ghost hunter lives including a room full of ""haunted"" items very similar to that found in 'Friday the 13th' the series, and a very unnecessary and contrived demonic possession and exorcism.<br/><br/>The behavior, backstories, dialog lines and general presence on screen of Ed and Lorraine serve to diminish the impact of the Perron's struggle and late in the plot even redirect our attention from that family's plight in order to serve up and wrap up the Warren's own needless side plot involving their child daughter. A glaring mistake the way I see it, and also a symptom of modern films trying to do far too much in the allotted running time let alone within the scope of a given plot.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring' is one of the more atmospheric horror films of the last decade in which bad dialog, unbelievable characterizations, unnecessary side plots and removal of viewer attention and suspense from the main story more than once mar what could have been an example of the haunted house horror sub genre capable of standing abreast of its more potent cinematic peers.<br/><br/>If you've been watching horror movies for several decades, you will quickly classify 'The Conjuring' as a composite of many other similar films you likely dust off and watch every so often. Likely as well you will agree that those ""borrowed"" concepts recycled here were much more satisfying when you viewed them in their original, respective places."

The trailers don't really give the film away; just enough tease to get you in the theater...and that is what counts.<br/><br/>Roger and Carolyn Perron, with family in tow, settle in what appears to be an abandon old rural home in Rhode Island. The rustic area in the woods, with dying trees and access to water seems to automatically conjure ideas of nightmares and terror. The action progresses like an old fashion ghost story. The family is so convinced they are not alone, they ask paranormal investigators Lorraine(Vera Farmiga)and Ed(Patrick Wilson)Warren to examine their home. The Warrens move in with the Perron family and quickly determine a satanic presence is in deed haunting the farmhouse. In spite of old mental wounds returning to bother Carolyn, she and her husband must rally all their skills and spiritual strength to battle the demonic menace wanting to keep possession of the house. Not a whole lot of CGI, but some very creepy and disturbing sequences.<br/><br/>The cast also features: Lili Taylor, Ron Livingston, Shanley Caswell, Kyla Deaver, Joey King and John Brotherton. I enjoyed the use of ""Time Of The Season"" by The Zombies and Betty Anne Steele singing the Santo & Johnny classic ""Sleepwalk""."

","""The Conjuring"" did scare me, but twenty minutes after I left the theater, I'd momentarily forgotten that I'd just seen it. While I was watching it I got a little bored and some scenes tempted me to laugh. If you've seen 1963's ""The Haunting,"" 1973's ""The Exorcist"" and 1944's ""The Uninvited"" you've seen three much better films from which ""The Conjuring"" gets its bag of tricks. <br/><br/>Probably any clever film student could make something like this movie. We all know the basic ingredients: a large, old house in an isolated setting. The house should be attractive but something about it makes it ugly. It's in New England. It's autumn: cold winds blow skittering dead leaves. An innocent family moves into the house. The family is generic, without too many details; they are All-American and the audience can identify with them. They do normal things like go to the beach and watch ""The Brady Bunch."" <br/><br/>Their new home contains many dark and dusty nooks and crannies. There are antique curios that look a bit menacing. <br/><br/>Suddenly, during a quiet night, a strange noise is heard. For some reason, no one in this family ever switches on normal lighting. Rather, they use weak flashlights or match flames. <br/><br/>An innocent child arises from bed in a long white nightgown. She moves slowly, slowly, slowly, down a dark hall to investigate the noise. The scene is very quiet, very long, and very repetitive. You know that eventually the innocent child is going to come across something unusual: a vision of a hanged person, the reflection of a ghost in a mirror, or something truly terrifying, an IRS man there to conduct an audit. <br/><br/>You know that at the same moment that the defenseless family member sees the unusual thing, the previously silent scene will burst with sudden, loud, and oppressive noise. The sudden vision and noise will startle you, and you will be scared. What you paid the ticket price for. Oh, and the family dog dies, birds act weird, and mom is bruising easily. <br/><br/>At first, of course, everyone in the house writes off these events as mere chance. Everyone is rational and is not tempted to believe in the supernatural. Eventually someone in the family levitates or clocks stop or people feel cold or something. Just like in ""The Haunting,"" there are loud banging noises. Just as in ""The Uninvited,"" a family member is possessed by the dark energies of the house, and there is the ghost of a bad mother and a not-so-bad mother. Just as in ""The Exorcist,"" there will be an exorcism. <br/><br/>So the team of experts is brought in. They speak some ancient language like Latin and possess arcane knowledge. I won't tell you any more because that would reveal the end of the movie to you, but I bet you can guess. <br/><br/>I'll just say that at one point, the satanic shenanigans in the house reach fever pitch. Satan is beating the stuffing out of these poor fools. Any sane person would immediately evacuate. At that point a paranormal investigator, Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) says, ""Leaving the house won't help because the dark spirits have attached themselves to you."" OH COME ON. Vera Farmiga may as well have said, ""You can't leave now because there's still forty-five minutes to go in the movie."" <br/><br/>Vera Farmiga is a scintillating actress. She electrifies every scene she is in. Patrick Wilson is perfect as her husband; they have great chemistry. The movie wastes them, though. The filmmakers don't seem to realize that Farmiga's human depth and complexity are the best thing the movie has going for it, and utilizing that human power would have made their film a classic, rather than just another ""Boo!"" movie. <br/><br/>""The Excorsist,"" ""The Haunting"" and ""The Uninvited"" are all scary but they are also deep. They present big themes. ""The Conjuring"" avoids big themes. One character tries to kill another, and it's the kind of killing that makes your skin crawl. The movie makes no attempt to plumb these murky waters. <br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" misrepresents evil and Catholicism. When the Warrens arrive at the haunted house, Lorraine has a rosary strung from her wrist. Ed Warren places little wooden crucifixes around the house. In the exorcism scene, Latin is spoken. This isn't true spirituality; it's fetishism – the belief that objects and rituals possess supernatural power. They do not. Only God has power. I am a Catholic, I pray the rosary, and I believe in Satan. The force that defies Satan is not an object, a rosary, it is rather faith in God."

","Okay. I first want to point out that I find it comical how the low scores for this film come from reviewers with poor grammar, lack of punctuation, and general lack of cohesiveness on any arguments. Anyone with any sense can tell that this film is highly disturbing and worth viewing, regardless of any negative comments there may be. <br/><br/>The best part about this film is the variety of scare tactics used. It is not a simply jump- scare film, nor does it rely on heavy gore to frighten. This is a well-balanced, well-done collection of scary sequences, each serving to continually build the suspense overall. The scares truly keep on coming as the film progresses, although not too quickly for the viewer to become absorbed in the family's struggle to adjust to a new environment. <br/><br/>A few reviews have mentioned ""plot holes"" and/or the ""unrealistic"" nature of this film. However, anyone who does a bit of research will find that the events documented here are all real and did truly occur. Yes, it seems hard to believe, but the fact that this was all based on a true story is not a gimmick. Do some looking and you will find the proof you need. In fact, this movie only shows part of what the family experienced, as parts of the true haunting experience were too disturbing to be added to this film. <br/><br/>The acting, by the way, is superb all around, especially with the daughters. I was glad to see Ron Livingstone in a role with some depth, and he stepped up to the occasion with more than enough zeal. Overall, I cannot recommend this movie enough. Instead of a 30- minute build for a quick scare, the scares remain constant and the atmosphere is very moody and unsettled. I was stunned at the amount of terror this semi low-budget work pushes out at a seemingly effortless pace. This is the movie horror fans (myself included) have waited years for. See it. Now."
"Scarecrow-88","7","1","4","28 July 2013"," The Conjuring
","James Wan's mega-hit, seemingly a great movie for October wisely capitalizing on a summer absent much in the way of theatrical horror, can't shake off its influences, such as Amityville Horror, The Exorcist, Poltergeist (there's a static-screen television), and Paranormal Activity. To me, this was basically Wan's contribution to the 'demonic possession/paranormal activity/haunted house' all the rage these days. <br/><br/>It concerns a couple in the late 60s/early 70s who would, with the help of a priest and tech crew (well, the cameras and equipment, light bulbs, etc, of that time), research cases of demonic possession for people and cleanse them (or their property) of the horror ailing them. This film features a family of seven under siege by the vengeful spirit of a Connecticut witch lynched on the property (on this creepy tree fit for Sleepy Hollow); this witch possesses mothers and uses them as vessels to kill their children. So the five daughters of the family are in quite a bit of danger, not to mention, their mother will be a possession victim. The house is the real star, to tell you the truth; it looks the part of a 70s Amityville relic (upon '71, the house had aged, with wallpaper, furniture, floor, windows, beds, stairs, a hidden cellar and crawlspace seeming to indicate it had been through years of time's mistreatment, with cob-webbing in the mistakenly discovered cellar and crawlspace indicating more habitation from spiders than humans), and the space involved provides Wan with plenty of room to navigate his camera, following the action of the characters (and spirits) throughout. While using a loud score and sound effects, courtesy of the Hollywood Machine needing to manipulate and manufacture terror from the audience, and descending into The Exorcist Lite, diminishes some of the power of The Conjuring, but the old school, traditional approach is appreciated (especially the use of the dark, and ""what lies around that next corner or behind the next door?""). Atheists will probably find this unbearable as plenty of Catholicism (Christian iconography and dialogue) and spirituality find their way in the script and in how the evil is finally put in its place at the end. <br/><br/>The reason you'll see The Exorcist bandied about is mainly because of the end where Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga (Mr. and Mrs. Warren, Demonologist Couple) work to alleviate Lili Taylor's Carolyn Perron of the witch possessing her. The usual crucifixes and holy water show up. Ron Livingston is the trucker husband of Carolyn, Roger, who is feeling helpless in regards to his family's safety. A leg pulled, a demon leaping onto a victim, a victim lifted off her feet by her hair and tossed into a glass-windowed door, the ghost of a maid with slit wrists appearing to scare a guy, a face with flesh ripped away by demon-possessed Taylor, eerie handclaps from a clothing cabinet and in the cellar (ruined by advertisements, leaving the scene without the surprise) during hide and seek games in the house, and Taylor awakened by the witch's spirit while sleeping: in the audience, every one of these moments worked, the theater had people shrieking and freaking out. I give credit where credit's due: Wan builds these scenes, the music helping him (of course), and there's the payoff. If the theater had remained bored and quiet, with phones lighting up and chatting remaining a deterrent, then I would have said The Conjuring was a failure, but the audience was held captivated and spellbound. Whether it was the situation involving a family terrorized by supernatural forces or the gradual escalation of the impending threat itself, The Conjuring worked on the crowd in the theater I saw the film. Too bad the film falls on the sword; Wan's film is reduced to the clichés now so shopworn when it comes to demon possession. The cast is good, though, even if Taylor must work on her best Linda Blair towards the end. Like in Dead Silence, Wan returns to the doll, and there's a marvelous scene where the witch's spirit is creaking in a rocking chair holding the doll, scaring the daughter of the Warrens (yes, another tiresome cliché of the threat towards the heroes' daughter is mined as well). Good opening use of the doll as an introduction to the Warrens, explaining how objects can be used as vessels for evil."

","THE CONJURING (2013) *** Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Lili Tayor, Ron Livingston, Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy, Kyla Deaver, Shannon Kook, John Brotherton. Affectively serviceable ghost story based on true events with paranormal investigating married team The Warrens (Farmiga and Wilson with chemistry to spare) who are enlisted by The Perron Family for help in their current haunting of an evil presence plaguing their new dwelling. Director James Wan pulls out all the stops and incorporates every trick in the book (creaking doors, Don't-go-down-that-dark-cellar ethos) and rams it full throttle and oddly enough works like gangbusters pushing all the right buttons in an equally workmanlike script by Carey & Chad Hayes.

","I like many kinds of films, including horror films. But for me to like a horror film it takes a lot. First, I prefer classic horror...ghost stories, and the like; I abhor the current trend toward slasher movies. I'm in my early 60s, so I prefer name-actors, because that increases the likelihood that the production will be a solid one (such as ""The Changeling"" with George C. Scott"" or ""Ghost Story"" with John Houseman). I went to this film for two reasons. First, I was simply in the mood for a movie, after having not been to the theater for a couple of months. Second, word of mouth was exceptional. So, even without a name cast, I went hoping for the best. I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The first thing I liked about this movie was actually the antithesis of what I usually like in a horror film -- a big-name cast. Although a couple of them have been around a bit, I didn't really recognize any of them to any extent, and they played the characters very much like real people. I have seen Patrick Wilson (as the real-life Ed Warren) a few times, but not been very impressed; here I thought he did a very good job. Even more exceptional was Vera Farmiga as the real-life Lorraine Warren; I want to see lots more of her in films. They brought a sense of realism to two paranormalists. Lili Taylor as the mother of the haunted family...just outstanding. Ron Livingston as the father...quite good. The children did their jobs just fine. I would have liked to have seen Shannon Kook get a bit more screen time...an actor with promise.<br/><br/>As to the story, the story line was not all that exceptional. Basically, a house is being haunted (and yes, this is based on a true story). James Wan (director) doesn't do anything that different here, but he pulls out all the stops, and he keeps you on the edge of your seat. I was startled frequently while watching, and interestingly, at the Friday afternoon screening I went to, more than half the audience were of retirement age...so this horror film appeals to all ages. The suspense rarely lets up.<br/><br/>The internet question has been how does this compare to other classic horror stories. ""The Exorcist"" -- well, I remember when that came out, and I liked it...but I liked this film better, despite not having as stellar a cast. ""The Shining"" -- not quite in that class due to Jack Nicholson's performance, but pretty darned close.<br/><br/>If you like a really good ghost story, see this film. You won't be disappointed."

If they were rated PG-13, then they were too childish and fake, and if they were rated R, then they were filled with gore, bad language, and nudity/unnecessary sex scenes. I had gotten to the point where I refused to pay for a ticket and would just wait for it to come out on DVD. However, The Conjuring looked good based on the previews, so I went to see it. It was absolutely AMAZING. There was no gore whatsoever, nothing even close to nudity or any sexual references, and if there was any bad language, I sure don't remember (I can guarantee no f- bombs or anything severe). It was genuinely scary, and it was probably the best scary movie I've seen in a looooooong time. I would definitely recommend it, and I can't wait for the sequel (At the end of the movie, the Warrens get a phone call about investigating a paranormal activity case in Long Island, which I'm assuming is supposed to be the Amityville case that they are so famous for. It's a subtle hint, but if that's what it's supposed to mean, then it leads perfectly into the next movie.)."

Going to try and not give any spoilers and just give a personal account!<br/><br/>The first big wave of goosebumps I got was from the opening title sequence. The big retro-looking deep yellow text across the screen, it gave a sense of nostalgia of a classic horror flick. I got this gut feeling like you know whats going to unfold over the next two hours. The movie didn't disappoint, in fact it was the best/scariest/unsettling/etc. horror film I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The directing was fantastic in every way, which was not brought down by the amazing actors. Every one of the many characters had a part, which many movies don't ever utilize. The shooting angles had me and the audience moving our bodies and heads from left/right and up/down in anticipation. <br/><br/>Really the only downside of watching in theaters is missing some parts when people are screaming their lungs out all around you. But don't let that discourage you...the sound sequences in some of the scenes (actually a lot of them) is critical. The bangs, deep bass, loud cracks, and SCREAMS felt like they were tearing my soul apart.<br/><br/>This review is all over the place and so am I over this movie.

","This movie sets out to grab the attention of thrill seekers for a good scare. Although, if you're not familiar with the paranormal world, give sincere credit as you watch -- this is not just a scare-tactic production -- this is a real true story.<br/><br/>I was anticipating for this one to come out for quite some time. The best thing I like is that the surrounding of the movie has ties with what I've followed from the works of Paranormal State (can be seen on A&E or Bio networks; Ryan Buell, lead investigator). Lorraine Warren has been featured on the show numerous times. She tags along on cases as demonologist & seeks out what forces that may inhabit any property as well as those needing spiritual guidance. Check this series out if you haven't before!<br/><br/>I will not go into too much detail of the movie.<br/><br/>The actors & actresses do a great job playing out this terrifying & epic story! Also, excellent to see a cameo by Lorraine Warren herself!<br/><br/>We will see a brief introduction on where the main plot takes off right as it rolls on. Time era is during the 70's. There is this couple that takes their research & put together lectures that go deep into the supernatural spectrum. They share what they can so the common public can relate on real paranormal occurrences.<br/><br/>A family moves into a new home. What awaits them is nothing expected by anyone. Let's just say that their realtor left out a good description of home history. Things of notice are becoming to take a toll within the house, which then has the mother seek out Lorraine & Ed Warren. The couple are used to all kinds of cases that come in many levels in association with being supernatural. This house just happens to host a much bigger problem that they haven't dealt with before.<br/><br/>Haunted entities, flashbacks of tragedy & demonic possession are all about to wreck havoc throughout everything & everyone.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie. Not by any means is the story fiction. Some may need to view this with caution, but I will definitely say that this has its scary moments along as it being a true story & now shared as a movie that is well done.<br/><br/>Will probably encounter some hair-raising on your arms, but I am one to find it quite interesting when that happens & thrilling nonetheless, which is exciting when it comes to the paranormal.

","I'm not sure if saying James Wan's The Conjuring IS based on a true story is considered a spoiler or not since it is clearly stated in all the trailers. Whether or not people believe that is another story. I would high suggest reading the book and watching the many interviews the Warren's have done over the years about the Perron family's experience. While I wished The Lone Ranger (another film just out this summer) would have been tightened up to 2 hours instead of it's 2:35, I wish The Conjuring would have been extended to 2:35 so as to include more of the preliminary events that led up to the Perron family eventually calling the Warren family in for help. Hard to fit all that into a 2 hour movie. But James Wan did an incredible job of making a great modern day ghost story in the class of Poltergeist and The Exorcist. Vera Farmiga did a good job of portraying Lorraine Warren, although the real Mrs. Warren is much softer spoken and more genteel. The greatest performance I felt came from Lili Taylor who had to run the gamut of emotion and pulled off what had to have been a very physically demanding role. Doe eyed Hayley McFarland was also quite good. I was most disappointed in Ron Livingston's performance as Roger Perron. He never quite pulled off the horror the real Mr. Perron must have felt. In an interview I saw of him he did state he was not a believer, which may have been part of the problem. Overall, a great film and well worth my $$.

","I'm always very wary and skeptical when it comes to slow-brooding and atmospheric nowadays ghost movies. All too often the setting, scenery and atmosphere are meticulously perfect, but the plot is confusing, full of major holes or even just downright inexistent. Ti West's ""The Innkeepers"", for instance, is such an example of a recent ghost story that is full of suggestive horror tableaux and false scares, like slow moving cameras through the hallways and doors slowly closing by themselves, but eventually it leads absolutely nowhere and the overall film ends up being a disappointment. The last thing anyone could say about ""The Conjuring"" is that it exclusively features suggestive imagery and false scares! Quite the contrary, this is probably the most action-packed and gruesome ghost story ever made. But the thing that makes ""The Conjuring"" a truly great horror accomplishment is that it masterfully combines the gruesome stuff with a powerful plot AND a petrifying atmosphere! The set-up and rudimentary plot is traditional stuff, with a happy family – mum, dad and five daughters no less – moving into a large and isolated countryside mansion where, evidently, a number of horrible events took place in the past. This house doesn't just hold one single dark secret, oh no, it's pretty much a museum of horrors and a hotbed for sinister occurrences! One small piece of advice: if the dog refuses to cross the doorstep, don't even bother to unload the car. Paranormal investigators Lorraine and Ed Warren quickly have to come to the rescue, but even they haven't visited such a hopelessly ominous place in all their years of experience. It may sound like a giant cliché, but ""The Conjuring"" is one of the sole movies in its kind that makes you feel uncomfortable the entire time, like there are evil spirits sitting behind you in the theater and breathing down your neck! Like he already demonstrated in ""Insidious"" and the shamefully underrated (in my humble opinion, at least) ""Dead Silence"", director James Wan has a wonderful talent to select the utmost nightmarish scenery, like the creepy doll and the gloomy piano in the cellar. The scares are also professionally timed, highly efficient and accomplished with make-up effects disturbing enough to surprise even die-hard genre freaks. The acting performances are more than adequate, from the adult lead stars as well as from the five young girls. The climax is slightly unsatisfying, but in defense of the film, I also have to admit immediately that it's very difficult to come up with a finale that matches the build-up."

","I am a horror movie enthusiast and had high hopes for this movie. I really and truly wanted it to be good, but it was a utter disappointment and anti-climatic. The commercials that they were constantly playing on television gave away half of the scares, it wasn't spontaneous because you knew the exact scenes scares were going to happen ( the ghost hand clapping behind the wife in the dark, the sheet blowing off the clothes rack and unto the unseen demon standing beside her , etc. People were actually laughing at scenes ( when the demon is dragging the wife all over the basement). I felt like the director wanted this to be an intelligent horror movie but it just fell flat."

","I wanted to like this movie. I am an avid horror aficionado and watch almost anything I can get my hands on, including foreign horror.<br/><br/>This film just struck me as not very scary or original. It seemed like horror-lite or directed at an audience who prefers the scares tame and watered down. I was never scared, creeped out or impressed at any of the reveals or entities. I figured out early on the mother was the target of possession once they revealed the back story of the witch. The story, supposedly a true case of the Warrens', wasn't very inventive. It took a long time to reach the apex of the story and then the resolution felt rushed and uninspired.<br/><br/>Insidious and Sinister had a much creepier vibe and originality. Shelter, aka 6 Souls was better than this and that went to video. I am not really sure why the reviews are so high. Horror is personal and very subjective, what scares one person will seem lame to another. Ghost stories and paranormal really get to me. This one did not."

"fedor8","Null","1","6","30 December 2013"," Satan cannot be happy with this demon's efforts.
","I love the movie's epilogue: ""Diabolical forces are formidable. These forces are eternal, and they exist today. The fairy tale is true. The devil exists. Oprah exists. God exists. And for us, as people, our very destiny hinges upon which we elect to follow: Oprah or God."" So simple, yet so true.<br/><br/>I also very much enjoyed the movie's prologue: ""This movie is based on a true story – as true as anything that guy with the funny hair tells you on ANCIENT ALIENS.""<br/><br/>For those of you who were a little bored with ""A Haunting in Connecticut"", rest assured that TC is much better. While not always gripping, the movie is never dull, with a good flow, some interesting scenes, and with yet another demonic failure. ""Diabolical forces are formidable"" the movie confidently claims. But are they really? This witch-demon wasn't able to kill a single character, not even any of the 6 girls all of whom should have been easy targets; there were over a dozen people milling about both haunted houses and yet the demon just couldn't get his act together, failing time and time again. And what a poor shot! Even using a gun at close range against civilians was too much for this witch hell-beast. Eventually, all it took to beat the demon was an amateur non-priest improvising a little with the Bible, in what was admittedly a hotly contested exorcism with a lot of broken furniture and plenty of screaming.<br/><br/>I have to address this demon's incompetence further. She had 103 years to wreck havoc on humanity, but all she managed was to kill a handful of people. Given Warren's cute analogy of demons ""latching on like a stepped-on chewing-gum"", and given the witch's enormous power, why hasn't she overtaken the entire American continent by 1971? Give me half her power, and I would rule the world within a week (if I were so inclined). Satan needs to send these demons to better training courses, because some of them just aren't doing too well in possession and murdering people.<br/><br/>That Warren couple must be a real piece of work, forging a decades-long career out of utter bull's dung. Well done; many a charlatan had their career cut short by prison-sentences, but this pair found a way to con the easily ""connable"" and even made money giving lectures at Universities about phony-baloney ghosts and goofy exorcisms. Still, they were useful in one way: a solid horror film was made about them, though not EXACTLY in keeping with the actual facts, perhaps straying just a little bit from the truth, say maybe 180 degrees, but no more than that.<br/><br/>There was some illogical nonsense, as always. When Lili Taylor witnesses pictures falling from the wall, NO-ONE in the house is woken by the massive racket, nor are they woken by the slamming of the cellar doors. Quite preposterous, considering that all five of her kids were in the house during this noisy ordeal. Also moronic was the fact that Ed Warren didn't lock the room in which he kept all those (allegedly) dangerous items, an omission that allowed his young daughter to rummage around in it, exposing the family to various ""genies-in-the-bottles"" who could come out and wreck havoc – and one of them did. When Warren finds his daughter hiding in the forbidden room, he gently pats her on the cheek instead of smacking her one real hard so she'd never again be tempted to conjure hell-fire demons from the deepest corners of Gahanna.<br/><br/>I was baffled by the pair's decision to head straight for the haunted house, just minutes after saving their daughter's life – leaving her in the same house in which she'd been terrorized just a bit earlier! But I guess one has to be a properly trained DEMONOLOGIST in order to understand all the fine intricacies and nuances of demon-control and behavior of Satan's minions. Who am I to question the decision of such a renowned scientist?<br/><br/>Still, we should consider ourselves lucky that Wan only directed TC, considering he's the guy who wrote one of the stupidest scripts of all time (""Saw""). TC would have been a very dumb movie had he chosen to write it up as well."

","I don't get scared often, or even really jump at most jump moments in most horror films, but The Conjuring delivers on its premise. It's not terribly original, but its scares don't hit you over the head and don't feel dumbed down. They're well-done, and the characters are well-written and so it brings in that extra dynamic to the table. The acting is also pretty great from all involved, Vera Farmiga being the stand out especially and unsurprisingly. Every time I see her I expect greatness and I get it, and I haven't even seen much from her. She's pretty fantastic and she gets some meaty material to work with and delivers the goods."

So like many stories of possession influenced by real life events perceived, invented or real. That all said, this might as well be a demonic soap opera. All the annoying cutaways, 50 versions of bump in the night followed by the required subject matter experts who blurt out a flurry of facts in the desperate effort to include said credibility. And when that doesn't work or they run out money, enter the now gratuitous Blair witch treatment. I wish I could place some blame on the cutting room floor but I suspect the director was present.

"q-46197","Null","0","1","22 January 2020"," A Film That Conjures Terror
","The movie The Conjuring, directed by James Wan and written by Chad Hayes, is one of the better known American horror films since 2013. It's a supernatural film, based on a true story in the 1970s about two well known paranormal investigators, Lorriane and Ed Warren, who were summoned to help the Perron family. They come to find out the dark background of the house and that something is latching on to the family. The Conjuring is a well written and produced film because of its key strengths it portrays throughout the movie.
The director, James Wan, has created other horror films such as Insidious and Saw that have also been some of the well known horror movies. Wan connects the stories of each fil together using the same paranormal investigators Lorriane (Vera Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) Warren. These movies show us that Vera and Patrick continue to be some of the best actors in the horror industry. Wan also uses many other techniques to get the audience involved in all his films such as: music, editing, photography and many more. First, the editing in this film is to make it seem like the stunts are actually happening. For example, in the famous scene of Nancy Perron, one of the daughters, getting dragged across the room from her hair by the evil spirit in the house. This scene demonstrates good film editing because it looks realistic as each strand of hair rises and she gets picked up from the ground. Another strength that was used was the music and soundtrack in the movie. Throughout the film, they use the high pitched tones and music to create anxiety and tension for the audience. I think how Wan used this technique was very well done because he let scenes go without the music and sounds then BOOM there is a musical jumpscare. As the movie goes on, we seem more ways to make the film as believable as it can like jumpscares.
Another key strength from this movie was the actual filming and composition through costume. The director uses many filming shots and angles such as a tracking used to follow the characters as they move around the scene. While using this, the filmer makes the camera look like its ""hand-held"" in many scenes throughout the movie, making it more realistic and like the audience with in the movie with them. In other movies, such as The Blair Witch Project, the director chose to use the point of view from a hand-held camera to make it seem like the audience is right there with the actors. Along with the filming, as I watched the movie, I noticed how the characters were dressed. Since the movie is based in the 1970s, the characters are wearing which is a form of composition making the movie more realistic because by having the children say words like 'far out' and 'groovy'. While James Wan uses these techniques, there is also and underlying theme to take away from this movie. Throughout the film, Lorriane and Ed Warren and the Perron family are stuck in this dark house with a dark presence. The key theme of this film is possession and using light and darkness to represent good and evil. For example, at the end of the movie when things are starting to turn out, there is this sudden change of filter and light to represent peace and happiness.
At the end of the film, I felt like it was a movie that was worth watching. From the techniques the director used to the actors bringing it all together. The Conjuring is a movie you won't forget after watching it. And who knows, maybe your family will run into the same dark trouble."

Its story lacks some originality yes, but horror director veteran James Wan makes sure that the audience hold their breaths through this rapid fire, jump scare inflicted, haunted house movie. Based on the real life stories of the demonologist Warren couple, it follows Ed (Wilson) and Lorraine (Farmiga) as they set out to help a family in need of some ghostly cleansing. There is a very profound feeling of absence of safety in the film and Wan really hits the spot in the delivery of sudden jump scares. While I think ""The Conjuring"" could have been slightly more innovative in its storytelling, choosing some more unexpected paths, the film is extremely effective as a horror movie. There are probably few horror fans that won't see how well Wan masters the techniques of horror movie making and the result is tremendously entertaining."

He's seen films like The Exorcist, Poltergeist and The Amityville Horror. He knows what makes them tick and what makes them scary. Timing is the key. Ghost stories are all about it. In supernatural horror, you need to treat it's production, every last phase of it, as if it is haunted itself. Wan has this down to a science, and for his efforts, he created a modern day screamer. In the summer of 2013, this was the talk of the film world. Everyone who saw it, in a dark theatre, had the same experience. A film so effectively frightening, you either looked away from the screen or you jumped out of your chair. Anyone who elicits this kind of response from an audience is a master in their own way.

","A good horror film requires a very delicate balance of most of the major film disciplines (writing, directing, cinematography, etc.); tip that balance even a little, and the whole thing can collapse. Despite some hokey dialogue, James Wan's The Conjuring is a gorgeous, low key frightfest that is guaranteed to induce feelings of unease and dread. The actual premise is nothing new: a family, terrorized by a spirit of possibly demonic origin, enlists the help of paranormal detectives (or demonologists, ghost hunters, or kooks) to rid themselves of their torment. While the fact that The Conjuring is based on a true story adds a bit of weight to the proceedings, it is not enough to counteract the blandness of the plot or the sometimes corny dialogue. That said, all the major flaws of this film have now been covered. Virtually everything else about it, from the precise direction and incredible cinematography to the outstanding set design and haunting imagery, is world-class, making The Conjuring a landmark in modern supernatural horror."
"FluffyPantsReviews","9","0","1","17 July 2019"," A modern day classic horror movie
","The start of a franchise is still what many call the best out of all of them. The Conjuring you might just be a scary haunted house movie but the horror in this movie is on a higher level. The house design in the movie is scary AF and a lot of the imagery including the hands coming out of the wardrobe and clapping, and the hanging lady and more. Ed and Lorraine Warren are awesome in every Conjuring Universe movie. Like I said a modern day horror classic."

","The Conjuring provides enough scares to back up the media hype. Usual narratives and camera shots become fresh and unnerving, with scenes making your hair stand on end. Sadly, the ending denies it conjuring up classic status."

","Take a haunted house film, add a Satanic witch, splash in a possession and pepper it gently with Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" and you'll get ""The Conjuring"". Not a bad blend - worth watching if you like possession and haunted house films.<br/><br/>It was a bit over the top at times - particularly towards the ending. I wasn't overly impressed with the film but it was kinda fun overall.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The opening interview was pretty cheesy, but the rest of the movie was very entertaining. Patrick Wilson accompanied by Vera Farmiga did stellar work as the Warren family. The pace of film was just right and the ""encounters"" throughout the film were accomplished quite splendidly as well. Don't particularly think this is something I'll watch again unless I forget certain parts and need a refresher, but it is something I'd suggest to anyone looking for a good possession film."

"truemythmedia","8","0","1","21 June 2019"," Very Solid Horror Flick
","This film is a wonderful homage to 1970s horror films- it's a film that is a little smarter than most horror films today, and it's surprisingly creepier as well. While some rather cheesy dialogue and a slightly corny climax bog down this movie, overall this film is quite impressive, and it stands head and shoulders above most of its horror peers.

","After a very long time saw a good horror genre movie. Seriously, except the scary atmosphere there was no other element added per se horror like violence, gore or abuses and still the movie acheived what it was made for. When we talk about like this movie there are many others with same theme already in market where a family moves to a house unknown to them that the house is demonicaly possessed. Still, this movie made it different with the way writer and creator showcased the elements of horror, built the story and scared audience with breathtaking jump scares."
"Macleanie","9","0","1","18 June 2019"," Conjuring is disturbing
","I usually find the horror genre a little boring but James Wans work is often thoroughly entertaining, he's one of the masters of modern horror movies. The Conjuring is disturbing I didn't find it very scary but it was very uncomfortable. This is down to a indescribable atmosphere that is created, often the case with Wans work such as Insidious. An impressive cast assisted a somewhat predictable plot and theme which has been done over, however rarely has it been delivered with such quality. You believe the fear and give into the terror not really knowing is coming next. The Conjuring is satisfying and will not be easy for people to watch, because its done well."
"rebelhopeful","7","0","1","4 June 2019"," The Conjuring does more with less
","If you're a fan of horror but can't stand gratuitous gore, then this is the flick for you.<br/><br/>I'm a little late to the party, I finally watched this movie for the first time today, and everyone has been saying throughout the years how creepy of a film The Conjuring is. I find that most of the praise has its merits, The Conjuring is a rock solid film that has scares that would surprise even the most jaded of horror fans.<br/><br/>This film is a slow burn in the first act, in my opinion, this movie would've felt better paced closer to 90 minutes as opposed to 120. The characters that were developed in the first act were okay, but generic for the most part in my opinion. I think all in all, the young actors in the film did a great job, it is more difficult than most realize to find decent child actors especially in a story of this nature.<br/><br/>The ""ghost hunters"" couple were interesting characters, in particular Lorraine Warren, played by Vera Farmiga. The genesis of her powers could make a decent spin off. Farmiga is the actor who shines in a genre that more times than not puts the art of acting last on the list of priorities.<br/><br/>This movie is a lover letter to fans who love demonic/possession types of stories. As far as calling this movie a classic, I just don't see it, but relative to the rest of the horror genre, this movie is a horror classic."
"jtncsmistad","7","0","1","2 June 2019"," ""The Conjuring"": Man, that Ending packs a helluva Wallop
","I am a big fan of Vera Farmiga. Not so much Patrick Wilson. That said, the two veteran actors are excellent together as real life ghost chasers Lorraine and Ed Warren in this based on a true story imagining of the couple's 1971 experience battling violently malevolent spirits in a family's remote farmhouse.<br/><br/>While the tone is unsettling and disturbing throughout, what we witness in the final twenty minutes of ""The Conjuring"" will blast you right square in the jaw as the Warren team gives it all they got to kick the holy hell out of evil.<br/><br/>Movies are great."

"dineshaishu","8","0","1","19 May 2019"," The conjuring
","Don't summon the devil, don't call the priest ...""<br/><br/>I was one of a lucky few to have seen The Conjuring at a preview screening for FrightFest 2013.<br/><br/>I went in totally cold, not having seen a trailer, nor knowing anything about the story or plot and it turned out to be one of the best scary horror movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is a nail-biting, hiding-behind-hands movie. If you've been disappointed with the likes of Paranormal Acivity and Insidious, this one is likely to deliver in areas where they failed.<br/><br/>It tells the supposedly true story of two paranormal investigators, who aim to rid families and properties of their suspected supernatural visitations, either by disproving them (if they turn out to be just creaky floorboards or slamming doors) or tackling them head-on if not. A leap of faith is required to buy into this theme but if you're okay with it, then the movies plays out pretty well within its genre confines.<br/><br/>The particular incident they are brought in to deal with is described as surrounding a spirit 'so malevolent' it was hidden from the public until only now. In fairly Amityville-like circumstances, a family move into a new house and discover the basement is sealed; boarded-up behind a doorway.<br/><br/>It's not at all surprising what follows, once they decide to take a look in the basement but it is surprising how James Wan has managed to take such a tired theme of haunting and possession and revive it so convincingly.<br/><br/>I am no stranger to these kind of movies but this one truly tops them all for tension and terror. I really enjoyed Sinister recently, which I found to be equally as scary but it lost its way a bit towards the end, whereas The Conjuring keeps tempo and has a fairly satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>I particularly liked the way the film took a turn for the comical somewhere in the middle, only for perhaps five minutes, then came back firing on all cylinders as it headed to the finale. If this was intentional, to lure us into a false sense of security, it worked beautifully.<br/><br/>If you're the type to poo-poo this genre in general, I can't see you suddenly being converted to a believer but, if you enjoy classic horror like The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist, I can almost guarantee The Conjuring won't disappoint."

"theredsky","7","0","1","17 April 2019"," The Conjuring
","It's an okay film. The build up is kinda slow but it gives time to establish good characters in Ed and Lorraine Warren. The cast for the most part does a good job. 2 of the child actors are decent and the others are garbage. There is only 1 jump scare in the movie that actually got me while I predicted all the other ones.
The movie is also kinda dark lighting wise. I watched this film in a dark room and some of the scenes were just too dark to see anything.
The plot is good. I understood what was going on and what the characters are doing and why. The film flowed nicely from scene to scene. The first 5 minutes are awful though. We basically get 3 introductions to Ed and Lorraine that repeats the same thing. It's only there to establish Annabelle for her spin off movie.
The last 20 minutes are amazing though. The exorcism scene is the best sequence in the film. There's tension, the camera shakes but it works with the scene, the lighting is good, the music is good, and the makeup on the demon is really good, and most importantly, it's CREEPY.
The Conjuring is a decent horror film that provides good characters, good story, and an amazing 3rd act at the expense of bad child actors, predictable scares, slow build up, and bad lighting."

"GiraffeDoor","2","0","3","11 March 2019"," Everything wrong with modern horror.
","Why do people like this movie? I'm not trying to be snooty but it's crazy... I don't think there's a single other horror movie that I'd say is more over-rated.<br/><br/>I watch a lot of this kind of movie and I'll be the first to admit that they can be a bit...repetitive (to put it nicely).<br/><br/>I have a rule where I never watch a movie whose title is a gerund because they always seem to be terrible. But I lifted that rule for this because people kept telling me ""it's not like the other conveyor belt horror!"".<br/><br/>Well, sorry to rain on your parade but it actually kind of is. I don't mind tropes. Tropes are tools. But this is one of the most derivative, generic horror movies I've ever seen. The cliches just keep on coming....evil smells bad... the dog knows... dark little cellars...and the most annoying of all: the paranormal investigators.<br/><br/>To me horror is a fight between people and the unknown. But bringing in the experts and giving names to everything stops it being mysterious, stops it from truly being a horror and makes it a dark supernatural thriller. And that wouldn't be so bad by itself, but this seems so committed to being what it thinks horror is, it gets kind of annoying.<br/><br/>It doesn't have gore, violence, sex or profanity. But so what? The issue with those kinds of movies was never that they were gory, or sexy or profanyey. it's that they coasted on it rather than actually put some effort in. This removes the gore and replaces it with...same old, same old. Thus it is worse than those other movies because it doesn't even have base pleasure to fall back on.<br/><br/>I get that it could be pretty effective horror for someone who had never seen a horror movie before. I attribute the financial success of this movie to how it baited that section of the audience by including Annabel plus the promise of no gore to get the two-horror-movies-a-year crown into the theatre.<br/><br/>I really don't believe that any type of incorporeal menace would spend any time mocking a human made religion. I don't get why they mess with this family rather than keep a low profile. The motivations of the antagonist just isn't convincing. I hate this movie's trite attempt to be poignant and about family.<br/><br/>As a non-believer, I really have no problem with the supernatural in the horror genre, up to and including the mainstream religions. Hey, maybe I'm wrong! The possibility of my world view turned upside down is scary. But this makes no concessions, it feels more like a sermon than a good religious horror.<br/><br/>Just an annoying movie. I will give it some credit for managing not to be too trashy and it does feel like there was real talent behind the camera.<br/><br/>But ultimately it is not a departure from the generic horror movie. We need to depart from this."
"reviewsbyjohnroe","5","0","1","19 February 2019"," It fails to meet expectations.
","Part horror, part Lifetime original, and part evangelical PSA. I might be able to forgive the disjointed sappiness if every adult character weren't so unlikable and one-dimensional. The mood and pacing is all over the place. Between the suspense and thrills, which are mostly pretty good in themselves, the movie shoehorns in the most awkward sentimental and expositional scenes, accompanied by music that sounds as if it were taken from a made-for-tv soundtrack. The kind of backstory we get is: this is based on a true story, the Salem witch trials were actually good, and witches loudly proclaim their love for Satan as they curse innocent people. There is no interesting motive behind the haunting, and every line is written with maximum possible cheese. I may be disinclined to be so critical if anything in this movie were original, but it's more or less your standard religious horror fare. Witches are evil, demons possess people, and only a benevolent Christian or two can save you. I've seen everything done better, right down to the exorcism. The witch demon using telekinesis to shoot a rifle was new to me, but it was a low point among the intended scary moments (the other really bad one being the second part of the terrible laundry scene, where you are expected to believe that the witch's spirit can control the weather, but only a little), making me laugh out loud in a climactic moment when I should have been terrified. To be entirely fair, this movie is worse in hindsight. It has a good atmosphere, some pretty good scares, and doesn't kill the shock value with loud, orchestrated jump scares early on, like so many horror movies do. It's worth a viewing if you want something suspenseful and scary, which it is most of the time, but it certainly doesn't live up to the hype."
"wtroggin-55558","3","0","6","31 January 2019"," Religious propaganda at its most stylish
","Mr Wan is a very talented film maker. This film and its sequel are very well put together movies. The Warrens are known frauds. Please do some research. There should be some kinda law about using ""based on a true story"" before a movie. Everything that happens in these movies is based on Christian beliefs. These films are meant to scare people into a dying religion and empty churches. It's over. Spirituality and faith are beautiful, they require no figure head, no palaces or temple and most importantly, no monetary donations."

"apryla-58795","3","0","2","17 October 2018"," This was supposed to be scary right?
","I don't know what I am missing. I feel kind of alone as most of the reviewers are stating that this is very scary and terrifying. Maybe I have seen too many horror films but this kind of thing is not scary to me. In fact I was laughing out loud at some parts. The ending was so stupid. The mom experiences a possession so deeply that she almost dies and then at the end she's just standing with her husband on the porch like it was a Hallmark film. If you had just been through that you would be rushing to the hospital to get your wounds checked out. So unrealistic.<br/><br/>I did like Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga but that's about it. Ron Livingston was so bland and boring in this. He must have been doing this for the paycheck only. He added nothing special and it could have been anyone in that role. There was no chemistry between him and Lili Taylor. In one scene they are in their bedroom after they first move in and she suggests they ""christen"" the house. He actually looks like he's completely grossed out about having to kiss her.<br/><br/>Maybe people feel this movie is scarier than it really is because it is supposedly based on real events. I did research on this when it came out because I was interested in the back story and it seems a lot of it was debunked. And of course if there was any truth to any of it this movie took a lot of liberties with the facts. Think about it...if you found yourself in their situation. If all those things were really happening why did they continue to live in the house for 10 YEARS?! I am sorry but there is just no way anyone would continue to live there if they were waking up with bruises or their children were so terrified they took to sleeping on the ground floor rather than in their own bedrooms. I know the filmmakers think they covered themselves by having the dad state that they had sunk every penny into the house and they had no where to go blah blah. Ok great but they could've explored other options. They could've pitched a tent in an open field somewhere and showered at the local Y. The children could've showered at their school gym. They could have appealed to family members or the community or something. So what if they defaulted on the loan! If their health and welfare was being affected to the degree that they were experiencing they could've found a way to not live there. It is utter rubbish to expect us to believe that a normal person would just continue to put up with that. I don't buy the whole ""it doesn't matter where you go"" the spirits will still haunt you. Ok did anyone else report that happening? NOPE! They all wisely just got the hell out and that was the end of it.<br/><br/>This honestly is no different than most horror films out there. They throw in the haunted house, ghosts and the requisite jump scares and they think they've got a winner. Supernatural stuff does not scare me because as long as I have lived I have never once experienced any of the things these horror films portray. BUT I will say if you want to see something truly terrifying just look to real life. I guarantee you the stuff that happens IRL is 10 times scarier than anything the writer's room in Hollywood could make up.<br/><br/>If you want to be truly horrified take some time to search up the 1986 TV movie The Deliberate Stranger starring Mark Harmon as Ted Bundy. The fact that Ted Bundy confessed to killing 36 people but the authorities believe it to be closer to 100 is truly terrifying. The fact that this guy was married with a child and just out there walking around among us looking totally normal but killing at random is what keeps me up at night. That movie is the reason that after all these years I won't walk alone at night and I have a healthy distrust of people wearing casts asking for help. They haven't even found all the bodies of the people he killed. It is so hard to wrap my mind around the fact that we encounter these individuals on a daily basis without knowing it. That should scare you NOT some paranormal crap drivel.<br/><br/>If you believe in spirits and ghosts then I suppose this might scare you but if you don't I wouldn't suggest watching this."

No. They went to their safe place and pulled the usual standards out and ruined it so they could showcase the lameness lies of Ed and Lorraine. The only part that was original and worth anything was the clapping game scenes. The rest of it was typical Catholicism bunk, and like any addictive behavior, it ruined the party.

","I usually have little problem accepting genre conventions. Without being a big fan of exorcism or daemon's hunting films, I believe that I understand the rules of the genre. Something odd (and bad) happens however with The Conjuring. It takes the genre seriously.<br/><br/>Director James Wan has the original Saw in his directing record, and he was the executive producer of the next six films in the series. He should know something about genre rules. One golden rule is that you either need to abstract the details to give the story a more generic touch (this is what was done with Saw which could be seen as a pure horror exercise, enhanced by the claustrophobic and time bomb effects), or include a touch of humor or some other elements to allow detachment of viewers from the 'tough' stuff. The damaging mistake made in my opinion in The Conjuring is that not only that none of these two elements is present, but also that all the story is taken so much in serious up to the claiming that it is inspired by true events and characters. What if you are not a Roman-Catholic, if you do not believe in daemons, if you doubt (as many Internet sources do) that Ed and Lorraine Warren (the couple of demon fighters in the movie) were really anything else than story tellers at best, fraud at worst? This film does not let you room to enjoy, because if you do not accept the convention little makes sense - story, dialogues, characters.<br/><br/>There is some good horror cinema in this film, which tried and to some extent succeeded to paint the action in a retro early 70s atmosphere, using film means of that period. However, the weak premises of the story make everything look artificial, and when noises become more strident and bodies start being dragged faster or fly higher, the lack of credibility is so strong, that it the even more ridiculous solution comes as some kind of relief.<br/><br/>Avoid!"

"lilliehardwick","10","0","1","27 December 2016"," The Best Horror has to offer
","When you move into a new home the last thing on your mind is whether or not you are going to be possessed by an evil witch who has been haunting the house for centuries, but in the conjuring we are forced to see the horrors that bestowed themselves on the Perron family. At first I was optimistic about seeing this film as so many others have tried to do the haunted house story but this film has many elements to set it apart from the others. Firstly, I think the fact that is all true and that the people who experienced this are alive and able to talk about it sets a fear off in you because it's not just some guy who has thought this up when he was sitting in his shed hunched over his type writer, real people experienced this. Secondly, I think the presence of the Warren's also makes it feel a lot more realistic as it's not like the family are trying to get rid of the evil on their own they have got help which is what we would usually shout at the TV screen when people take matters into their own hands. Thirdly, I love the music throughout the film most horrors now don't have that crescendo of notes building the tension up. My favorite few moments are when the real heart pounding scenes are on and they show a small shot of the front of the house and play that spine tingling noise which just confirms how bad this is for them. A final major element that makes this film for me is the unraveling of the plot and yes they find out about the witch and they believe that is all they are dealing with but there is so much more evil, sadness and pain roaming around that home which makes you feel so repulsed by it many of you may have reached for the remote. Lili Taylor really delivers her role well and really makes you think is she just ill or is the witch slowly getting to her? In addition, her exorcism scene was so dramatic and emotion by the end I felt as though I could finally sit back in my seat and relax as it was all over. The best scene for me had to be Joey King's main piece when there was definitely something behind that door, the sheer terror of her face and the fact that we couldn't see what was behind the door but we too knew there was something there made it a lot more scarier than there actually being something behind the door. All in all this film soared past my expectations and really scared me."

","The Conjuring(2013) Starring:Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Ron Livingston, and LILI Taylor Written By:Chad Hayes & Carey W. Hayes Directed By:James Wan Unlike most people I have never seen a good modern paranormal/demon horror film. I've seen paranormal activity's one and two and I hated them. But last year there was this trailer about a horror film called the conjuring and every one was excited and everyone saw it but me. What caught my attention is when everyone said it was one of the best horror films ever. The other little piece of goodness was the possessed creepy doll and considering I'm a fan of creepy dolls I had to see it. The film is based on true events of two ghost hunters Ed and Lorraine Warren who help a family that is being haunted and one family member possessed by an evil entity that will latch to whoever is living on their land. I don't know how much of the story is true but I do know for a fact that I was expecting to be really scared but instead I was frightened, creep-ed out of my mind, the fact that unlike other demon,paranormal, exorcism movies this one was based on a true story which I believe helped the film, don't you sometimes hear things at night. James Wan is one of my favorite directors especially when it comes to the horror genre, he made one of my all time favorite horror movies that scared me as a boy that I still watch to this day the very first Final Destination from 2000. Which was a very creepy dark horror film about paranormal deaths conflicted by the grim reaper because someone had a vision and didn't die and they would be picked off one by one. Wan also produced a lot of the X- Files episodes and he's really good at building tension and suspense. The only problem I do have with this movie and I'm pretty sure you will too is that it's poorly paced in the beginning of the picture. But once more stuff starts to happen in the house and the family meets the Warrens it starts booming and it stays booming. You'll be on the edge the rest of the movie. The movie has really good performances especially from Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga they were the best thing about this film. YOu could tell that they gave their all into these two characters. LILI Taylor is also amazing as the distressed mother who is experiencing all of this strange stuff going on around her and her family. The Conjuring is one of the best paranormal/Demon/Horror movie I have ever seen so far. The performances are top notch, the movie is very creepy and frighting and James Wan got some rally nice shots with his camera work but it is poorly paced in the beginning so I'm going to give The Conjuring a four and a half out of five."
"orbcardinal","8","0","1","16 August 2016"," Amazing
","This is by far my favourite horror movie because there are so many components about it that make it actually believable. First of all, this is being based off of a true story already set the precedent. I'm not one to believe in demons or anything of the sort, but the fact that this is based off of two real demonologists really sold it for me. Second of all, one thing I really liked and really appreciated about this movie is that Ed and Lorraine (the two demonologists) weren't the kind of people to interpret every little thing as a haunting or a demon. There's a scene where we see the couple completely debunk a 'haunting' at a house, and they even explain that most cases aren't legitimate hauntings. So with that in mind and the fact that Lorraine even states in the movie that this case stands alone as one of the scariest really helped to sell the story. Finally, just the the movie in general was very well done. The scares weren't too overdone, the suspense wasn't very predictable, and there was that little bit of humour sprinkled in that I always appreciate. So, in summary, a very well done horror movie that I think and horror fan should watch."

"sergioarmenta95","8","0","1","7 April 2016"," A familiar plot elevated by good directing, likable characters and authentic scares
","The Conjuring stars Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as Ed and Lorraine Warren, real-life paranormal investigators in one of their most frightening cases. This is one of the scariest movies I've seen in recent years.<br/><br/>James Wan's work on the Saw and Insidious franchises showed what he could bring to the horror genre and The Conjuring has cemented his role as a crucial horror movie director. At its base, The Conjuring is the haunted house movie cliché. While we've seen this done to death, James Wan brings in new ideas, old methods and great direction, not often seen in scary movies. By using practical methods rather than CGI, we get more authentic scares. Wan is also great at building tension. Other than a couple of cheap jump scares (the first music box mirror sequence), most of the scares are well deserved. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that makes it stand out is its cinematography. It has some of the best set up shots and scenes done in recent horror movies. It also feels very seventies in its style, a welcomed change to the uninspired found footage plague. <br/><br/>The score contributes a lot to the suspense of the film. It is very eerie, macabre and almost industrial. It's great during scenes of both silence and chaos. It does suffer from what most scary movies do nowadays which is turn up the bass and torture orchestral instruments to scare the living crap out of you, rather than trust the visuals will. It is fitting sometimes but I feel it is overused. The soundtrack includes some great tracks of the seventies which compliment the vintage atmosphere. <br/><br/>Horror films are not known for award-winning acting or likable characters. That's another way The Conjuring stands out. Lili Taylor as Carolyn Perron does an outstanding job during the latter part of the movie. I've not seeing such a deranged performance since The Exorcist. Everyone else does a good job playing their roles. Even the children hold their own, another rare occurrence in scary movies. <br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>While The Conjuring has a very solid plot, it is often predictable and clichéd. The young child befriending a spirit, the skeptical father, and the exorcism are all very common in movies like this, but The Conjuring does a far moreover compelling job than its contemporaries. It has a typical structure, with a slow first half focusing on the characters and small incidents that start build up. This is where most scary movies fail for me, they fail to make me care for the characters. I care for the Perron family so when everything starts going down, I'm invested. The last 20-30 minutes of the film becomes a disturbing, nail biting race against time that had me on the edge of my seat. It manages to keep surprising you with constant scares and frightening imagery until its resolution. <br/><br/>The Conjuring is must watch for any horror movie fan. It tells a familiar story but great directing, impressive cinematography, likable characters, practical effects and truly frightening moments make this an example to follow for horror movies to come. <br/><br/>8/10"

","Even though the exorcism genre is extremely overplayed, The Conjuring stands tall among this overcrowded genre. While it doesn't add anything new to the group, it does a great job building suspense and offers a few genuine scares. The storyline is as bland as they come, a family terrorized by ghosts/demons turns to someone with psychic abilities to fight the demons and ends up needing to perform an exorcism. We've seen this time and time again, but this time James Wan adds some solid nostalgia/style and what I think stood out the most, terrifying sound effects to make the movie something special.<br/><br/>I've said it before and I'll say it again, The Conjuring is the most polished, clichéd, horror movie ever made. It features hardly any original ideas, but it takes a generic storyline and somehow makes it shine, it's crazy to see how effective a movie can be in the hands of a good director. A certain crowd-pleaser, this will probably be the general public's favorite horror movie of recent memory, but certainly not mine."

"matthewstelly","7","0","2","13 December 2015"," The Conjuring Conjures Up Hopes for a Better Sequel
","The concept of white supremacy is what produces such images and characters as ""Superman"" (all powerful), Aquaman (controller of the seas), Wonder Woman (an amazon with super powers), Batman (super smart and virile), Thor (a Norse ""god"" that exists in their mythology that came to comic books and is now a hit on film), the Hulk (white man is a genius but creates a laser/radiation beam that puts color in his skin and when he turns green, he goes berserk), Daredevil (blind man with super acrobatic powers, is an attorney by day), Spiderman (punk kid gets bitten by a Spider and gets super powers, speed and fights crime for free), and so many more. But in the white supremacy culture, it is equally important to show that just ""regular white folks"" can also be masters of their domain and of those around them. This is where ""The Conjuring"" comes in. People want us to believe that in November of 1971, this stuff really happened. That is bovine scatology, plain and simple. Afamily moves into a house that is ""haunted"" as in so many other movies(""Poltergeise,"" ""Amityville Horror,"" ""The Haunting,"" ""Dream House""etc.). In this case the demons must be ""exorcised"" from the home and that is where we find the link between white supremacy and the white view of their religious beliefs. As I've written elsewhere, the white man sees religion and the concept of ""god"" as nothing less than an extension of his own power. In this movie the Catholic church gets all this credit for being able to ""exorcise"" demons, not only from individuals, but also from houses. It is no longer enough to ""exorcise"" the devil from human beings; now we have a residential structure and, as the pastor points out, ""This house needs an exorcism."" There are criteria for you to qualify to have an exorcism performed, we learn. You have to be a member of the (Catholic) church, the kids involved (one was being possessed by a demon) have to have been baptized and third, you have to have approval from the Vatican. What? This movie didn't hold true to that because the guy that performed the exorcism for the family that was having the problems had kids that weren't baptized (at one point he says we were eventually going to get around to it) and they DIDN'T get the permission from the Vatican, although at movie's end the writers made it a point to throw in a final scene where the couple that performed the exorcism ""finally got the call from the Vatican."" But these whites had already solved the problem, defeated the devil, and all is well. This whole idea of ghost hunters, haunted artifacts and these apparitions is a recurring themes in these movies (as in the case of ""This Is The End""). All of this pays into the white man's view of himself and the pervasiveness of his power. And of course, there is the flip side: since all religious, saintly, holy and spiritual power equates to white power, then expect references to evil (as in this movie) to be regarded as ""a DARK spirit."" Or how about this line: ""I've been seeing the DARK entity that haunts your family – it's feeding off you."" According to this white supremacy-based bullshit, there are three phases to someone being taken over by the evil. These stages are, first of all ""infestation,"" where a bunch of evil spirits congregate in a body and, as in this case, an actual house. Second is ""oppression,"" and that's where they start playing pranks on you, messing with lights, slamming doors and, in short, scaring the living bajeebies out of you. Third is ""possession,"" and that's where the evil spirit takes control and sees you and anyone else as an invader or outsider. The title of the movie is, ""The Conjuring."" According to Webster's Dictionary, ""to summon by or as if by invocation or incantation."" In other words, a key part of the exorcism is to call on the devil to get the hell out of the body it is possessing, so you're ""conjuring up"" the evil. But guess what? There's another meaning as well and it's mostly used by the British. But these people are related by culture and their collective hatred of people of color, so you have to study words that they use in their entire context. To ""conjure"" also means ""to treat or regard as important."" What??? And therefore a ""conjuring"" could also mean to pay homage or tribute to, couldn't it? And is that not what I am alleging: that the white man's evil ways here on earth are, indeed, ""devilish""?"

It's the same placid formula of spooky noises and self-closing doors that has been done to triple death since the beginning of times. It wasn't scary the first time it was utilized and it's just a time-waster by now.<br/><br/>If everything you see in a movie makes you automatically transfer the plot to real life in your head (regardless of plausibility) then, hey, follow what the legions of people who foam at the mouth over this movie. The most engaging scene comes very late into the movie, but you have to endure a lot of talk and smoke and mirrors type gimmicks before getting to it.<br/><br/>My standard when it comes to horror is SAW, which was directed by Wan who's also behind this flick.

","I guess it's a good movie for what it is supposed to be. Apparently it's based on real events. That probably explains why everything that demon woman did and the 'scary' stuff that happened in the house looked so random to me. It starts of interesting with the investigators of ghost and supernatural stuff. Things start also nice enough with the family getting into their new home, with a family of 7 it's of course pretty hard on who to focus most. I thought it was going to be their story but after 105 minutes I still knew very little about them only that they loved their time at the seaside. Focus was actually on the ghost hunting couple. Anyway my interest really started to decline in a steep way when focus got on investigation with all the machinery needed for it. Memories of the awful Insidious, Paranormal Activity they all passed through my head. With the exception that Conjuring went even more spectacular making people fall, things flying through the room, stuff breaking, sudden apparitions, dragged through the room by the hair etc. How much more did they need to show to make it clear it was a dangerous place and demon? Needless to say it didn't really work for me and the storyline behind the demon was pretty poor as well. Kudos to Vera Farmiga, she was the only worthwhile performance in this movie.

","""The Conjuring"" conjures up the spirit of ""The Exorcist"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""Poltergeist"" and ""The Birds"", but manages to be scarier than any one of those by itself. ""The Conjuring"" is based on a true story (if you believe in that sort of thing) from 1971. The film follows the story of a couple who investigates paranormal activity and call in a priest when they can prove that a house's quirks are more than just squeaky boards and rattling pipes.<br/><br/>Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play the couple as two serious and gifted individuals who sincerely want to help people. It's obvious that they're inevitably going to be needed by the family who moves into a creepy old house (with an even creepier tree on their land) in Rhode Island. That other couple is played with charm and sincerity by Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor (who does Oscar-worthy work here). They have five daughters and a seriously malevolent presence in their home. As is the case with most horror movies, it takes too long to get to the really scary stuff....but when it gets there, look out! Slamming doors and dead animals turn into visions of evil spirits and, eventually, demonic possession.<br/><br/>As the ghost-hunting couple gets involved, things go from bad to very bad. Their research uncovers a long-forgotten series of tragic deaths in and around the house and they begin to gather audio, video and photographic evidence to bring to their contacts in the church. The question is whether all their efforts are too little too late. The malevolent spirit who started this whole mess has some seriously evil plans for the family. And when everything comes to a head....let's just say that the spirit really, REALLY doesn't want to go.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" brings together the two couples' stories very effectively and all the efforts to save this family give us more to watch than most horror flicks do. The climax of the movie is so tense and action-packed that I'm even willing to forgive (mostly) the film's unnecessarily slow build. I give ""The Conjuring"" a B+."

","Roger & Carolyn Perron, along with their 5 children, move to a new countryside home in Rhode Island but it's not long before things start going wrong. It all starts off with the usual doors closing & opening; pictures falling off the walls; creaking floorboards, but it's not long before things start taking a more sinister turn. Roger & Carolyn find help in the form of Lorraine and Ed Warren, two paranormal investigators who have investigated countless instances of paranormal behaviour, and working together they soon start to find out who - or what - is behind the events that is plaguing their home.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is a pretty decent horror/suspense movie, but unfortunately it wasn't as good as I was hoping. To be honest, it's a little bit slow paced at times until roughly the last 20 minutes where everything gets pretty relentless and comes to a head. In saying that, though, it's never a boring movie and it has a good few scares with some pretty decent tension that gets built up quite nicely along the way.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier, the last 20 minutes is where the movie is at it's best and definitely makes up a wee bit for the other lacking parts of the film. The movie has two story's that criss-cross with each other. We have the main story of the escalating incidents with Roger & Carolyn and then there's the one that shows glimpses into Ed & Lorraine's lives as investigators. The stories entwine well with each other without getting confusing or muddled.<br/><br/>This is definitely not on the same level as films like Insidious or Sinister, but if you enjoy other films like The Amityville Horror and A Haunting In Connecticut then you will probably enjoy The Conjuring.<br/><br/>Overall, a pretty good movie to watch and I recommend giving it a go."

It was hurried, unrealistic and completely out of character for Carolyn Perron up to that point and became simply preposterous. Why do Hollywood do this.

","THE CONJURING is a technically proficient, yet ultimately empty and derivative scare-fest which fails to deliver any real scares. Before jumping into what I find wrong with it, I will give some credit to James Wan for effectively using camera-work and the soundtrack to ratchet up the tension, but he mostly goes for the overkill approach. The score is overbearing and telegraphs each and every jump scare from a mile away. There were only a couple of moments that even slightly startled me. Not only that, but the movie doesn't even try very hard to create an emotional connection between the audience and the family who's being haunted. The only characters that are explored and developed in any way are the Warrens, who don't even really enter the main story until about halfway through the movie. Until then, you have two separate story strands (which could have been two separate movies) which only intersect in a convoluted way. Therein lies another problem: they could have cut out a lot of side-story involving the Warren's daughter in favor of developing the family that's central to the ""conjuring."" It's almost like the movie wants to do too much. Then, there's the laughable source material. I am not one who subscribes to a belief in the supernatural so the entire pretext/concept for the movie is not one that particularly engages me. Still, they could have done a whole lot better to engage me in other ways, like actually getting me to care about the situation. Instead, they import every genre cliché and trope from nearly every other paranormal horror movie, throw it at the screen and hope it sticks. Not much of it does. Still, I will give the movie credit for effectively using a balance of practical and CGI effects. Some of the stuff they show isn't too graphic, but it's creepy enough to leave an impression, at least for a little while. So, is it worth watching? Only if you haven't seen stuff like POLTERGEIST, THE AMITYVILLE HORROR, and even James Wan's own INSIDIOUS which at least introduces some comic relief to lighten things up. This movie takes itself WAY too seriously, and suffers as a result. It's also borrows so much from other, greater films that it feels like a greatest hits compilation at best. Too bad it falls flat on it's face."
"FairlyAnonymous","6","0","1","28 September 2014"," Well... at least it has a unique time period...
","For months my friends have been telling me that The Conjuring is the modern horror classic. While Insidious was good, this movie was even better. This movie showed how horror movies should be done.<br/><br/>Well... Insidious wasn't bad, it wasn't amazing... and... this same goes with this movie.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the Annabelle doll case just for to have a cool trailer. Sadly, the movie has nothing to do with the doll that was so heavily advertised. The doll just plays a part for an intro case that explains an example of a paranormal case, as if setting the stage for the rest of the movie. It is confirming ""The rest of the movie is going to be this good"".<br/><br/>Unfortunately, The Conjuring is probably the least scary horror movie I have seen in quite some time. The intro is by far the creepiest aspect of the film, while the rest of the movie doesn't have any scares. I'm not even joking when I say this, there was not a single moment in this movie that actually took its full potential. There were a lot of moments that could've been scary, but simply ended up without a scare. This is a common trend in horror movies now: Build up a scare that will never happen, so as to confuse the audience. However, even that is becoming predictable, because now you can tell if there is going to be a real scare or not.<br/><br/>The other thing is that when this movie tries to be scary, it actually fails at it mostly because the camera stays running for half a second too long. In one scene a ghost jumps out at the camera shouting ""SHE MADE ME DO IT"" which could be scary, however the problem is that this happens over the course of a second and a half or so and the girl runs at the camera. This means we get a good look at the ghost moving towards the camera before she becomes threatening. It's the timing that is important in making something scary, and just about every jump scare in this movie is timed incorrectly. <br/><br/>This is interesting because the beginning of the movie seemed to understand what was creepy; however, the majority of the movie doesn't. What's even weirder is that the doll comes back for a scene side- story that never has a complete arc. This is weird because it is as if the movie is hinting at ""The doll is the real ultimate evil all along who is behind the scenes and is the ""real"" scare of this movie"" but the doll never has a complete arc. It just exists, sitting in the back of the movie (literally) having its own useless presence.<br/><br/>Now the actual character elements of the movie aren't horrible. The characters have fairly good acting and the some of the characters are likable. However, nobody dies, so what is the threat anyways? The worst thing that can happen is someone gets bumped on the head or knocked out.<br/><br/>The camera angles aren't horrible in this movie, but some of the are pointlessly complex and thrown in randomly for the sake of directing. Though, there were some nice shots by horror movie standards. So that was nice.<br/><br/>All in all The Conjuring isn't a horrible movie, it just isn't a good horror movie. It isn't scary, most of the cast is boring, and nothing in the movie stands out. I feel like I've seen this premise before and I have seen these characters before. The soundtrack isn't bad, but it has improper timing and the same goes with the scares. Timing is key.<br/><br/>Watch it if you want to be bored for a good hour and a half or so."
"KnightsofNi11","Null","0","2","17 September 2014"," Scared me so bad a lil bit of pee came out
","Somebody once told me that director James Wan apparently doesn't like doing horror movies, and he's just stuck in that genre. Why then does it seem like he had so much fun making The Conjuring, one of the more terrifying, blood curdling, and heart pounding horror flicks I've seen in a long, long time? I feel like the dude must enjoy the genre to some extent, or else he wouldn't be so great at delivering the scares, because The Conjuring delivers. <br/><br/>The Conjuring is based on the true story of the Perron family, a family of seven that decided to move into the most haunted house they possibly could. a multitude of ghosts and demonic forces terrorize this poor family in their quaint country home, to the point where they have to call in paranormal experts, or demonologists as they're self-titled, Ed and Lorraine Warren, a real life couple who investigated hundreds of hauntings in their day, including the much more well known Amityville horror house in Long Island. The Conjuring tells a lesser known Warren tale, but its a haunting that honestly puts Amityville to shame. <br/><br/>When it comes down to it there is only one thing you should ever ask of a horror film. You want it to scare you. Above all else you want it to chill you to the bone and just scare the hell out of you. Well, congratulations The Conjuring, you scared the ever loving crap out of me. The film starts out creepy from the get-go when we learn the story of Annabelle the doll, a creepy looking doll possessed by a demonic spirit. <br/><br/>Then we meet the Perron's and their incredibly haunted home full of deviously manipulative demons. It's no secret to the audience that this house is haunted, so James Wan makes sure to play up the devilish foreshadowing and the heart thumping moments of tension building so well that I could barely sit still during those slow quiet zooms into dark corners or ominous stairwells. <br/><br/>Then things kick off and it's just terrifying. The early scares are very well placed and very well timed, putting no minds at ease and keeping the audience anxiously awaiting the next fright. The first two acts provide some really chilling scares, and I even had to laugh at certain points about how good of a job this film was doing at scaring the daylights out of me. Then the third act just becomes all sorts of intense, but still not without it's share of great moments that sent chills all the way up my spine. <br/><br/>The Conjuring scared me, so despite any of its shortcomings I have to peg this film as a huge success because it did what it came to do. The dialogue is a little sophomoric at times, and there's an obnoxious amount of expository conversation, especially when the Warren's open their mouths to start explaining ghosts, demons, and the like. Some of the acting leaves a little to be desired. There are a couple of supporting actors who don't need to show their face in a Hollywood film again until they've taken a couple more acting classes. But some of the larger roles are actually played very well. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga make a great Ed and Lorraine Warren, and watching their own story unfold parallel to the Perron's gives The Conjuring a bit more depth.<br/><br/>It's definitely a movie that follows the haunted house structure to a T, but it is more successful with this structure than most. Stylistically it's a nice breath of fresh air, as James Wan decided to go with a vintage 70's horror style since the film itself is set in 1973. This added a little bit more life to The Conjuring, even if the classic and modern styles step on each others toes at times. The Conjuring honestly does all of the things it is supposed to. It falls short in some areas, but from a strictly horror standpoint the film rarely, if ever, slips up. I'm no horror expert, but I know what scares me and The Conjuring? Yeah, I was terrified."

Soon, a demonic spirit terrorizes the Perrons and Carolyn seeks help from the Warrens to help them rid the unspeakable evil haunting her and her family.

","I heard nothing but rave reviews about this flick and unfortunately it just didn't deliver for me. There was a lot of build up and suspense in the first two thirds and outside of a few scares in the last third of the film, I found it lacking. For it's nearly 2 hour running time, I kept waiting for it to really thrill me liked it did many others who've seen it, but it just didn't happen. <br/><br/>To the film's credit however, it relied less on gore and genre clichés and more on traditional horror elements such as a creaky door here, a dark corner there and a few ""there's something in the mirror!"" moments. So in that sense it was really well made. I also thought the score was *incredibly creepy* (sigh, if only the film had lived up to it). I did enjoy it, but it's no where near a horror classic. If you're into a more traditional, old school horror flick it's worth a watch though. <br/><br/>Enjoyed my review?

"SocialMediaFluff","8","0","2","15 June 2014"," This is a great movie, but not for the reasons you think
","This review is chuck full of spoilers. Everything I wrote is a spoiler. You will be spoiled on all parts of this movie if you continue to read this review.<br/><br/>8 things I took away from the Conjuring in no particular order<br/><br/>1. The ghost hunter guy looked exactly like Will Arnett. I could not take him seriously at all. Everything he said, the way he carried himself, the outfits, the haircut - it was all Gob Bluth. In fairness, this was my perception that others wouldn't necessarily have, still, it made this movie hilarious.<br/><br/>2. If I ever decide to move, I am taking my dog to every open house with me and the minute Ser Barkley doesn't want to go through the front door, I'm not going through the front door. Listen to your pets, friends. They've been trying to tell you about houses filled with demons for years now.<br/><br/>3. When you are alone in the house with 5 children, the outside doors are banging open and you hear footsteps and destruction in various rooms - run past the phone to investigate the basement. DO NOT CALL THE POLICE. As an unarmed person, you are the perfect one to protect your family and defeat whomever might've broken into your home in the middle of the night.<br/><br/>4. If a monster showed up in the scary armour, clapping and whispering ""I'm going to kill you and your family"", most young children would get out of bed to check it out in the dark. This is the normal response of a scared child, not screaming their faces off until a parent comes into the room like 7-year-old you and I would've done.<br/><br/>5. How unlucky did these people get? They couldn't just buy a haunted house, they had to buy the most haunted house ever in existence. The big backstory reveal was so hilariously over the top, everyone I watched this with was in tears from laughing so hard.<br/><br/>6. It invades the mother to kill the child. It invades the mother to kill the child. It invades the mother to kill the child. ""Here kids, jump into the car with your bruised up mom, who's been acting funny since having a weird episode in the bathroom a couple hours ago. Oh and don't worry about that part 10 minutes ago where we mentioned she was being fed on by a demon. Go ahead and drive to a motel while the rest of us that are trained to deal with type of thing stay here. Nothing could possibly go wrong with this plan."" It invades the mother to kill the child.<br/><br/>7. ""As a trained ghost hunter, I think it's safest to keep my collection of possessed demon trinkets locked up in my converted guest bedroom. I'm sure my 6-year-old daughter will be fine sleeping a few rooms down. It's just not worth an investment in a backyard shed or external storage site. The church is fine with this plan. It's also a good idea to show it off to reporters in hope that they write positive things, just as long as they don't touch anything of course."" <br/><br/>8. This is the most powerful demon in the history of demons. It has caused centuries of death and madness to a huge radius of land. Having a demon hunter exercise it out of existence takes 5, 6 minutes at most. Gob Bluth is well-trained in this, he's seen it done before a few times.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie high marks because it was the funniest movie I've seen all year. Bonus points to Brad Hamilton, the best cop in town and my favorite person in this movie. I want a sequel where it's him and the audio kid running around solving paranormal crimes."
"Leofwine_draca","6","0","1","14 June 2014"," Well made, but why so predictable?
","Director James Wan said that he watched loads of '70s haunted house movies before sitting down to direct this, his latest horror movie after the INSIDIOUS flicks. Unfortunately, it appears that the co-writers of the script also watched all the same movies, because this turns out to be yet another entirely predictable exercise in fear-building.<br/><br/>I don't really have a huge problem with THE CONJURING, other than to say that it's all been done - and been done better - before. The old movies like THE AMITYVILLE HORROR and THE ENTITY just seemed to have more authenticity, better production values, and a freshness that made them more frightening. THE CONJURING, meanwhile, goes through the motions without ever offering anything even remotely resembling new.<br/><br/>Saying that, it's pretty good by modern genre standards and a lot better than the schlocky INSIDIOUS movies, also starring Patrick Wilson. The characters played by Wilson and Farmiga are entertaining, not least because they're based on a true-life ghost-busting couple (although to credit them as the ""world's most renowned"" is insulting, given the reputation of other noted paranormal investigators in recent history such as Peter Underwood, Maurice Grosse and Guy Lyon Playfair).<br/><br/>The film looks good, and the cast can't be faulted for really getting behind their characters. A shame, then, that Wan is severely lacking in imagination when it comes to the scares. Typically they involve spooky wardrobes, characters descending into cobwebby and unlit rooms, and loud noises on otherwise quiet soundtracks. All very predictable. And the ending goes down THE EXORCIST route again, which is disappointing. Like SINISTER, this is a film with bags of atmosphere and lots of potential which is well worth a watch for genre fans, but it lacks the magic spark to make it anything other than average."

","Spoken of in many circles as one of the scariest offerings of 2013, ""The Conjuring,"" however, fails to live up to this hype!<br/><br/>Falling far short of being a typical ""horror movie,"" it does somewhat succeed as a (not so accurate, but acceptable) presentation of factual demonic activity, being based on a true story.<br/><br/>Although, admitted to by the Director as having been well-researched in aspects such as the gamut of real-life paranormal investigations conducted by the film's protagonists, very little has been done to incorporate their scientific/spiritual interpretations/conclusions.

There is no fear climax whatsoever!<br/><br/>One could have excused the poor constitution of the scenes if compelled by the necessity to keep to the true sequence of events. However, the incoherent (due to want of understanding demonology) but intentional fictional interpolations, on the part of those responsible, make even this defense, unavailable.

","The fact that the cast and the name are different does not change the situation. You've seen this film before. Whether it was ""The Exorcism of (enter name here)"" or something else in the range of supernatural possession or even alien abductions, the plot is the same: family moves in the middle of nowhere for no good reason, bad things start happening, a team of ""specialists"" come to the rescue and the movie ends with a ""based on a true story"" line.<br/><br/>For me The Conjuring was slightly different because the film was recommended to me by a friend who pointed out the subtle camera work and the good old fashioned scares. So that leaves me in a dilemma: do I appreciate the movie as a standalone horror, forcing myself to ignore the entire list of similar movies since the 80s till now, or do I denounce this as a shameless clone of so many films of the genre? One has to wonder: if the viewer sees this type of movie for the first time, is it not a good movie if they enjoy it?<br/><br/>But I cannot try to judge all of this based on the pleasures of some hypothetical person. I have to rate it based on what I know, and what I know is that I have seen this film before and cloning it does not one an artist make, but a Xerox at most.<br/><br/>Bottom line: every single line, every scene, even the effects and camera work, for all of them I had the strong feeling that I have seen them before. And, alas, they also happened exactly as I had predicted minutes before, down to the makeup and sound effects. I can't really appreciate that. I have seen a lot of crappy movies and some of them copies of other crappy films that I have seen before, but each one brought something slightly new: a monster that was different, a situation, a character type. Just enough to make a small difference. The Conjuring brings nothing new to the table, absolutely nothing."

Now the Annabelle doll you see at the beginning has great potential other than that don't expect to be scared at this one. Basically a family of six move into a new home with a demonic presence inside of it (unknowingly of course), and as time progresses things get worse and worse for the family, to the point they bring in ghost hunters for help.

","Before I saw The Conjuring I heard a lot negative complaints that it was merely ""cattle prod cinema"" which I inferred meant a lot of awful stingers were the only thing that would make the audience jump. This horrible cliché has been overabundant in many so-called ""horror"" movies for a good while now and I my expectations were low.<br/><br/>Thankfully, there are no stingers. Yes, there are scares and jumps, but the score is completely unobtrusive and there are no cats jumping out of closets or phones suddenly ringing. James Wan knows that atmosphere, cinematography, suggestion, and the unknown can build suspense and horror, and the Conjuring has plenty.<br/><br/>Apparently based on a true story (which I am extremely doubtful of, but not completely disbelieving) a happy family of mom and dad and five young girls move into a large farmhouse bought at a low price from a bank auction. As soon as they cross the threshold things are not quite right and the property reeks of pure, menacing evil. Eventually they call in the help of a local ghost-hunting couple to document the case and research its history.<br/><br/>It was the early 70s, the real Ghostbusters (pun intended) were still in college.<br/><br/>About 80% of The Conjuring works. The dread, the suspense, and the inability to comprehend what is really lurking in the darkness of the house makes for great horror. The girls see...something, but we don't. It's a lot like Robert Wise's The Haunting, which is kind of ironic since Lily Taylor, who plays the mother, was in the 1999 remake of that movie, which was full of all the worst horror clichés and set-ups, as well as excessive CGI. It's like Taylor wanted to set the balance straight by doing a movie that took the opposite, and more intelligent, approach.<br/><br/>John R. Leonetti's photography is very slick, with lots of slow, creeping shots, but I couldn't help but think that a rawer edge, with exploitation lighting, would have helped it look a bit more authentic. There are a bit too many slamming doors scares too, and towards the end it goes off on a completely pointless tangent with the Annabelle doll and does absolutely nothing with it. For the bulk of the running time The Conjuring seems original and groundbreaking, though in the last act it's a jumble of Blair Witch, The Exorcist, and What Lies Beneath.<br/><br/>The positives still far outweigh the negatives, and I still recommend the film to horror fans. If only we had a version of The Amityville Horror that was made this way instead of that horrendous 2005 movie. No doubt there will be numerous sequels."

","Why is it that the demonic forces of hell seem only vested in haunting American families in big wooden houses found in the countryside? Does hell only have a one way exit to America? Why is it since the legendary ""ghost-hunters"" or Demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren hung up their possession hunting crowns, opting instead for death and retirement, that all ghosts and demons now appear to have lost the will or ability to stir up echoes. And what was it with the seventies that got all these ghosts and demons into a dizzy whorl that they needed to posses everything from houses to dolls? <br/><br/>The Conjuring does very little to answer any of those important questions as we once again enter another house Stateside that has a dark entity attached to it that baying for all of its occupants blood. For a film of such a nature the one thing I can say is that it did manage to conjure up a rather marvelous cast - Vera Farmiga and Lilly Taylor are both excellent in their roles and add a certain amount of gravitas to what is normally a nameless entity.<br/><br/>Whilst certainly not believable in the slightest nor scary in the least, if you can suspend your disbelieve for a fraction of a second you may just to believe this whole tale of witchcraft and satanic horror scaring the bejesus out of an everyday 1970's American family to be actually true until real life intrudes as the final credits begin to roll."

","I have to admit that when I heard about the Conjuring and realized that it was directed by James Wan who directed Saw and Insidious I almost didn't even see it. The movie stars Patrick Wilson who acted in Insidious, so I figured it would probably be the same movie essentially. I was very wrong and am very glad that I saw it. Because not only is the Conjuring a great horror film, it is a great film full stop. <br/><br/>Someone once wrote that every story has already been told, so it's not the story but how you tell it that matters. And this is certainly true of this film. Whilst the premise of the film is nothing new, the actual way it develops is what makes this movie great. <br/><br/>In the movie, it is 1971 and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) are paranormal investigators who either disprove false claims of paranormal activity or assist people who are genuinely troubled by demonic possession. They are called by Carolyn and Roger Perrot (Played by Lilly Taylor and Ron Livingstone) to help them and their five daughters. The Perrot's bought a new house and believe that their house is haunted by something sinister. The Warrens agree to investigate and subsequently discover that the family is being haunted by a witch from the 1870's who made sacrifices to the devil and committed suicide on the property. Since then she has haunted anyone who tried to claim her property. Supposedly this movie is based on true events that happened in the 1970's. I never heard anything about this before watching the film and frankly I care more about the fact that the story is well written, not as to whether it's based on real life events or pure fiction. But the fact that the movie takes place in 1971 makes it better to watch then if it took place now as all the modern technology would make the movie less believable. <br/><br/>On the surface of it, the Conjuring is not original, and is reminiscent of movies like The Exorcist, The Amityville Horror, The Exorcism Of Emily Rose, and many many more movies which deal with demonic possession. There are creaking doors, a gloomy basement, hidden passages as well as ghost children, a creepy haunted doll and an exorcism. What sets it apart from most other movies in this category is that here we become well acquainted with the characters in the movie and actually care about what happens to them. There is a slow build up of tension that starts from the beginning and doesn't let go even though there are moments of comedy to relive some of the tension. The movie goes from being suspenseful to horrifying and doesn't let up until the conclusion. Some scenes genuinely gave me chills even though they are not gory or distasteful. Another thing to mention is that unlike many horrors released recently this one has no nudity, no swearing and no gore. But don't let that mislead, this movie doesn't need to distract you by any of that. That's how effectively scary it is. <br/><br/>The acting is great from all the participants including the child actors who play the five daughters. The effects are very well done and don't distract from the story. The direction is great and there are some very effective camera shots.The music is good as well and suits the movie perfectly, adding to the sense of unease even though it sounds very similar to the music from Insidious.<br/><br/>People have criticized this film saying that it is not original and that creaking doors, demonic possessions and people levitating have all been seen before in movies and that's true, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie in any way. A demonic presence levitating, doing its taxes whilst quoting the entire works of William Shakespeare would be original but that doesn't mean it would be good to watch or entertaining in any way. <br/><br/>In conclusion I found this movie much better than Insidious, Paranormal Activity or it's sequels, Drag Me To Hell and many of the horrors that came out in the last few years. I will definitely watch it again. A definite horror classic."

I read this was based on a true story. In all honesty, I wasn't that excited for it. Once I began reading all the positivity regarding this movie, my outlook began to change. It's been a long time since a recent horror movie has frightened me like this one. The ""Low budget, found footage"" style has seemingly taken over, so it was refreshing to see an old fashioned horror movie. This is set in the 70's, and I was so impressed about how they managed to mirror the time period like they did. Whether it was the hair styles, the retro clothing, the cars, or something else, the 70's atmosphere floored me. I was amazed by the slickly shot jump scares. The jump scares aren't the phony one's you see in a Paranormal Activity film, these legitimately startle you. Director James Wan does a very smart thing by letting your imagination do the work for a little while, before revealing frightening close-up's of the spirits. You're never fully comfortable, and the slow build-up does wonders for this movie. They have not executed a possession film so adroitly, since The Exorcist. We also get characters you can rally behind. Everybody in this movie is likable. Patrick Wilson is ironically in Insidious 1 & 2, so he's no stranger to haunted house films. He rocks some fantastic sideburns, and conveys his emotions very well. There is a reason he's becoming one of Hollywood's top actors. Vera Farmiga is the best actress in Hollywood as far as I'm concerned. There is nothing this woman can't do. She absolutely nailed her role as Lorraine Warren. She was so intense, and I was on her side the whole way. The Warren's have quite a reputation in real life, and I felt Wilson & Farmiga did them justice. Lili Taylor scared the hell out of me, plain and simple. She makes Linda Blair look like a pussycat in comparison. This part had to be rigorous for her, no doubt. She also manages to pull off a convincing mother who I'd try and save any day. It takes quite a feat to be so likable, and then so creepy. It was a magnificent showcase. Ron Livingston made me forget about Office Space, and gave a great performance. He underplayed it, and I dug it; special mention to the kids for being so brave, and likable. It is a rarity where every character is sympathetic. The finale is full of chaos and non stop frights that had the back of my neck hairs tingling. It does get a little bit conventional, but it's done so adroitly. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: You'll have trouble going to sleep when you're through with this one. I had my room door closed, all the lights off, and food in hand. It felt good to be scared again. The Conjuring is not only one of the best of its kind in recent memory, but one of the best in history. Believe the hype, folks. <br/><br/>9.7/10"
"christophe92300","7","0","1","12 December 2013"," A very good surprise
","This is your basic horror movie that relies on the usual tricks of the genre, even some clichés as the one of the match enlightening an entire room. We're therefore far from any kind of originality but The Conjuring is incredibly effective on every level.<br/><br/>The content is the most classic possible, where the challenge is met is on the form which is the most important aspect for an horror movie: the mise-en-scène and direction are perfect and produces the jumps synonymous of success.<br/><br/>Within the first minutes, you get sucked in by the infernal spiral of this family embodied by a seamless cast, and the sustained rhythm of the narration makes the time fly.<br/><br/>Even if it is very conventional, The Conjuring arouses a real pleasure and turns out to be a very good surprise."
"jimbo-53-186511","7","0","1","9 December 2013"," Nothing particularly new or original, but I still found it to be an effective and engaging film for the most part
","Based on a true story, The Conjuring follows husband and wife paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) approaches the couple in the hope that they will be able to determine what are behind the strange goings on in the family's home. Ed is sceptical at first and often believes that there is a rational explanation for the majority of these 'strange happenings' in people's houses (a scene earlier in the film demonstrates his point). However, once at the Perron family home, Ed and Lorraine quickly realise that there is a presence in the family home and must try to find a way of removing this presence;<br/><br/>The good news (at least as far as I was concerned) is that James Wan was directing this film. I always find with his films that he has a gift for creating tension. Everything in this film unfolds at an even pace so it neither feels rushed or drawn out. We begin to notice things one by one; the clocks all stopping at 3.07 am, doors seemingly being pushed open on their own, something pulling on one of the child's legs etc. There is always something happening, something to keep you watching.<br/><br/>For me, the biggest strength of this film is the way the suspense and tension is created. This is what I would describe as a 'psychological horror' - it is a film (much like his earlier film Insidious) that very much 'gets inside your head' and keeps you guessing. The very fact that we don't learn who the demon is or why they are terrorising the family till later in the film only helps to keep the viewer in suspense. This is why horror films of this nature work best; sometimes fear of the 'unknown' can be more terrifying than fear of the 'known'. <br/><br/>Wan's direction was also excellent and the way that the camera swoops around the house, coupled with the excellent score really made this a fairly scary and tense affair.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part was good and I was particularly impressed by the acting of some of the children in this film. The principal adult cast all put on fairly decent performances as well. <br/><br/>For me this was a really good film, but unfortunately I was unimpressed with the ending of the film. I need to be careful here as this is based on a true story so this may have actually happened, but here goes; There is a scene where Ed attempts to perform an Exorcism on Carolyn, but despite his best efforts he fails to 'Exorcise the demons'. But then minutes later, Lorraine puts her hand on Carolyn's head and then tells Carolyn to think of happy times. She tells Carolyn to remember the photo she showed her and to remember how she'd never let anything happen to her family. Then just like that, the demon leaves her body and she is then OK. What? So an exorcism doesn't work, but giving Carolyn a good talking to, whilst putting her hand on her head seemed to do the trick. If that's true, it's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard of.<br/><br/>This was a very very good film and in all honesty, it's only let down slightly by a bit of a weak ending. It's definitely worth a look and is one of the better horror films that I've seen."
"emma_malakian","8","0","2","5 December 2013"," One of the only real scary films
","Those who are familiar with the Warrens will remember them from the Amityville and the Haunting in Connecticut. I am a big horror fan but rarely ever find them scary, this however left me and my husband jumping and on the edge of our seats. <br/><br/>The film is full of twists and excitement, although my advice would be to not watch this at night unless you want to be awake all night. The sounds of the rope swinging in the tree haunts me, very scary as we decided to watch this at 11pm!<br/><br/>The only let down for me was one of the ""story lines"" felt unfinished. I'd have liked to see them locate Rory's body and bury him, thus also finding out maybe why he vanished in the woods.<br/><br/>Overall a good watch, good for a scare and it has a good plot. I'd recommend it for anyone who likes ghost stories, I'll be watching it again."

","I've been wanting to see The Conjuring for a while now, and I finally got to watch it last night. As usual, James Wan was the master of foreboding. I never knew what was coming, but he delivered the package with this movie. When the Perrons move into the farmhouse of their dreams, Wan does a fantastic job letting you know something bad is going to happen. This movie has what I like to call the Paranormal Activity property. This means that the movie is still really scary, but builds up to something terrifying in the last, say, 30-40 minutes. Remember that. However, the movie is not very original, like Insidious or the Exorcist. Well, technically the Exorcist was only original in the early 70's. But, whatever. The demons in the movie are nothing new, but can still scare the crap out of you if you aren't ready for them. Just expect the average looking demons. However, the interesting style of directing, great acting, great dialogue, and great special effects are the reasons I'm calling this a classic. Not because it is original. There average cliché things like doors shutting or opening, creaking, and stuff moving by itself. This is one of those movies that you know could be turned into a Scary Movie VI or something like that, but you hope doesn't, like me with Scary Movie 4 and War of the Worlds. There are 5 kids in the movie, but their names aren't really said much, so you forget what their names are, really. The truth is, the movie might have been better if there had been less kids. Maybe 3-4. Have you noticed that a lot of times, the people making the movie think adding a really weird name to one of the characters makes the movie more scary? Like Bathsheba in this movie, and Abyzou in the Possession. How do they come up with those? Have you also noticed that when there are footsteps in the house somewhere, they are always super close to each other? Even if they are 6' tall, they walk like penguin steps. Just saying. Even in Paranormal Activity, with the three toed thing walking and showing the steps. There were some decent jump scares, though, and they got me a couple of times. Considering the fact that I am probably one of the youngest movie fans, and I was only scared a couple of times, the shows that the movie isn't very scary. But trust me, it is good. I thought Patrick Wilson was the best acting choice for this movie, though, because he is such a fantastic actor in this genre of film. He is good no matter what role he has in any movie though. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes scary movies, and has taste."

","The movie is a supernatural horror film and is based on the true story of the Perron family, on the reports from paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. The Perrons, Roger and Carolyn, with their 5 daughters, move into an old run-down farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. Very scary events start taking place including deaths and unexplained injuries. Everything from the clocks stopping at a certain time to an attacking spirit, The Conjuring is a real eye-opener to the supernatural. Carolyn contacts Ed and Lorraine for help where they do an initial investigation, but state they need approval from the church and further evidence before performing an exorcism.<br/><br/>The origins of the house is that a witch named Bathsheba owned the house and tried to sacrifice her children to the devil and then committed suicide in 1863 after performing a curse on anyone who would attempt to take the land. The 200 acreage had been separated into smaller sections where there were reports of houses on it where there were several suicides and murders.<br/><br/>The Conjuring captured the real essence of what actually happened which seems hard to believe unless you've actually been in a creepy situation. Do you believe in the paranormal, the after-life, or not? Watching this video might just change your mind. - Asif Zamir"

","The Conjuring is a good horror film with a lot of scary and jumpy moments. The films story is about how a family which is going through some financial struggle has to move to the country into old house, which is haunted from its past.How this family hires two ghost busters to solve there problems forms the main plot. Its probably the best horror film of 2013. Old school horror tricks are used amazingly!!! This film comes when most horror films are falling flat on there face. James Wan is the new Saviour of horror films after such films like paranormal activity and Saw 100 have failed. A must watch for horror film enthusiast"
"kostov-yordan","8","0","2","18 November 2013"," This is the new classic
","When I saw the rating 7.6 i have to admit that I was quiet skeptic. As a huge fan of Horrors i expected something like ""Dark water"" or "" The messengers. Wrong! Badly wrong! The movie is awesome and I am so disappointed of myself that i did not follow James Wan works earlier. This guy obviously have the right vision about horrors. Sure one of the best horrors lately along with the new version of Evil Dead. Great camera movement and very good cast. seems totally realistic and I am so glad that they didn't ruin everything with cheap special effects. It has been the first time for so long when i was ""on my nails"" for a second. And it happened actually twice! Believe me, for somebody that have more than 1000 horror movies in his watch list - that is something. The story is supposed to be inspired after true events, and i will check that later for sure because seems really interesting. No matter that i prefer movies with more occultism influence very the storyline, and usually do not like those with regular scripts as ghosts or possession, here we are on a different level. Much much different. It is a must see movie, If you miss it now, after you see it later you will regret it! You can bet on that!<br/><br/>Hope you enjoy it :)"
"markt4909@aol.com","7","0","1","13 November 2013"," Torn about this movie
","I think the film is probably about a ""B"" for me. I think some of the scary scenes are effective for sure but there where some things that really bugged me. For example, I know this is based on a 'true story' but I don't really get the purpose of Patrick Wilson's character. He doesn't seem to add much value as a character and every time Patrick Wilson talks, I almost wanted to laugh. It kind of 'subdued' the horror. The same can be said for some of the makeup. For example, the police officer in the scenes at the end looks like a bad ""Will-Farrell-Anchorman Porn Star"" - it was annoying.<br/><br/>Vera is pretty good. Ron Livingston is the same in everything he does so I didn't see a lot there. Lili? is pretty good as the possessed mama. All the kids are good....would have liked to have seen more of them."

","This was a real kick to watch. About 20 minutes in I caught myself scooting half way up the back of my chair, and a couple of times I must have jumped 6"" into the air. After a real let down from Paranormal Activity 4 (I had to fight to keep from falling to sleep) The Conjuring was a delightfully scary film that at least claims to be taken from real events. They had some fresh gags that got the blood pumping with excitement. You really have to love the cast in this film. Everyone put in a star performance and took the audience for a thrill ride from start to finish. If you can watch it on Blue Ray on a large screen with surround sound you will be in for a couple of hours lost in this entertaining production. I know it is one I want in my collection."
"jahanzeb-farooq","8","0","2","3 November 2013"," After a long time a movie that really scared the hell out of me!
","Finally a horror movie that we deserve. It's after a long time that a horror movie scared the hell out of me (a few recent ones I remember are The Orphanage and The Descent). Without killing a single person or showing any blood, the director managed to make a real horror movie which doesn't rely on cheap tactics or soundtrack to scare you. Some of the scenes really stand-out and will linger in your memories for long e.g. one of the girls sees someone standing behind the door, the witch jumps from top of the cupboard etc. After Saw this is another genuine success to James Wan's credit. Please give us more of this. Highly recommended!"

"myspecialparadise","8","0","2","28 October 2013"," Not Bad At All
","Kudos to the director for creating a horror film that has no gore, and none if those four letter words that we can live without! Plus, not nude scenes, or sex! Three cheers for James Wan! The story line is handled pretty well, which means that the film cutters made few mistakes. However, when it came to the script ... far too often there was far too much dialogue being rushed out of the actors mouths. That was very irritating! One very obvious example comes from Kyla Deaver, in the part of April ... she isn't a natural! Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston made a great husband and wife, but the realism of the family, all taken into account, was rather unrealistic. I don't believe there is a family in America that is as stable as this family was portrayed.<br/><br/>Lili Taylor is always good in these ghost movies, and she should have no problem playing in them for the rest of her life ... however, some of her acting was not up to par with Ron Livingson's! What a cool guy! Then we come to the most irritating part of the movie ... the Warren's constantly referring to why GOD brought them together. Once was enough! However, both Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson did a great job when the scripting didn't get in the way. Basically, when it came to most of the actors / actresses it seemed that they were in a tug of war when it came to who could speak the most words faster that the other, or whom could say more words than any of the others! It was very obvious, throughout the film that actors are always in competition when it comes to whom has the most lines! One mistake is when the Warrens are showing a film to their classroom. They tell the class if they look closely at the guy's eyes, they'd see drops of blood tearing in the man's eyes ... actually, the blood was flowing down the man's face, and had been wiped away before the Warren's finished their sentence.<br/><br/>Another mistake ... the cabinet knocking sounds was not always in threes. It was twice, at one time, then four times at another time.<br/><br/>However, even with all the annoyances, and mistakes, this film is still one heck of a good horror flick! On the other hand ... the ending was rather drab. I would have preferred to see everyone go back into the house, and the house blow-up ... with the witch laughing in the flames! But that's just me! I'm weird! I also thought that the Poseidon ship should have rolled over again at the end ... killing all of them. Now tell me ... if a ship is upside-down, in the water, with only its butt sticking up ... wouldn't it have gone down when you opened her up? Whatever ... this movie is still worth watching, and I've been watching it for a couple of days now."

","James Wan is probably the most famous young horror director. He was involved in the Saw saga, directing two and producing all of the movies. He's also famous for including a specific trademark in all of his horror movies – that trademark being creepy evil dolls. But The Conjuring is supposed to differ from his previous works, since it's based on the true story of the Perron family and Ed and Lorraine Warren, the latter being famous paranormal investigators who worked on the Amytiville Horror case, among many others. The Conjuring was extremely well received, which is kind of a surprise, as new horror movies are not generally known for being good.<br/><br/>In 1971, the Perron family – Roger, Carolyn and their five daughters – moves into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. On their first night there, they discover a secret cellar, and while sleeping, an invisible force pulls one of the daughters' leg. In the morning, they find their dog – who didn't want to enter the house – dead. The next days, more strange things happen: doors open on their own, clapping can be heard when there's nobody there etc. Frightened, Carolyn (Lily Taylor) convinces Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) to come and inspect the house. The couple discovers a malevolent spirit attached to the Perron family and decide to look for evidence in order to request an exorcism from the Church.<br/><br/>The Conjuring isn't entirely faithful to the true story – for example, the Perrons lived in the haunted house 10 years, while the movie makes it look like just a couple of weeks, and they have reported the presence of good spirits, too. But that's not really relevant, especially because most people will find it much more interesting to speculate whether the spirits/demons are real at all (it happens with every movie of this kind). And also because The Conjuring is a great movie. It's not a typical jump scare plus murderous demon kind of horror, which is excellent because it really works hard to scare you, mainly by creating atmosphere (unlike the jump scares that just abuse human instincts). In the end, you find you were mostly afraid of nothing, because you expected something to appear but it never did. This is the movie's best feature, since all the other scares, featuring visible spirits, aren't quite as scary. I also appreciated the fact that the movie's following two timelines – the Warrens' and the Perrons'. The Warrens' especially adds a lot of drama to the movie, which makes it very relaxing from time to time, but also lets you connect with the characters a lot. Too many times do we see a horror movie in which people die before we've even learned their names.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, too, especially the children's – who all look genuinely afraid when they have to – and even though there are no famous actors in the movie. Finally, the use of soundtrack was amazing, as a dramatically loud sound was rarely heard when something scary occurred: again, the makers of the movie didn't focus on humans' natural, instinctive responses in order to create fear. Now, about the things I didn't quite like. The movie starts out with the Annabelle doll story: a doll inhabited by a demon was taken by the Warrens to their home after they had performed an exorcism on it. There is absolutely no reason to start the movie off with that story, since it isn't linked in any way to the Perron family, either in the movie or in real life. Still, this start is interesting and creepy, and I admit it seems reasonable to use that story to explain what the Warrens do for a living. Moreover, the beginning is not as bad as the ending of the movie. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll just say that all the build-up during the movie doesn't quite pay off and everything is kind of underwhelming. Nevertheless, The Conjuring is a very good horror movie that will intrigue and scare – and maybe even make you keep the lights on at night.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.com/"

","What makes this film great is that it builds on old-fashioned cinema values usually tossed out in horror movies. No stupid behavior from the characters. No gratuitous scenes. Believable reactions, as in the marvelous moment when the mom, scared but searching the home, yells at whatever is rattling around. Add stylish filmmaking and Bathsheba, and you're good to go. Beyond this, Wan is beginning to expand what horror can be - basically, and I've always felt this, it's a genre in which all other genres can exist. Put another way, it's simply drama when it's done well, as solid story and characters evolve and confront shifting realities. Lecture done. Let me just end by saying how much I loved and appreciated - at last! - an ending not ambiguous."

","For me as agnostic, weird things result from lack of knowledge and/or twisted mind. Well, there are clairvoyants, but they are persons with sharp senses and enhanced psychology skills. When I am too lazy to ponder, I confine myself to Murphy's laws... Besides, I do not find old house or weather related creaking doors or outside rustles - or similar - supernatural or scary and I do not believe in bad aura.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, from time to time, I watch movies dealing with the above topics, particularly if fine directors and actors are involved. In the movie in question, Vera Farmiga was the biggest traction to me: her pleasant physiognomy does not hinder her being versatile... Regretfully, she was the only part I really enjoyed, all other things were okay at best. There were lot of scenes when you expected that something would happen, but either nothing did or the incident was ridiculous, i.e. non-real or deriving from the past. Fuss with finding evidence was not fresh as well, similar depictions have been used in dozens of movies before... Well, I can admit that some twists are thrilling - especially to those having weaker nerves - but all this related exorcism and religious connections provide all this mess odd undertones. I would have preferred a real, personified evil attempting to make his or her misdoings look supernatural or so (i.e., someone trying to chase neighbors away for various reasons, personal revenge, etc.). The ending was nothing special and expected as well.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is not bad, but lacks new approaches and elements for ""impassive"" and non-religious people like me."

","Spoiler Alert. Enjoy the movie if you don't want another's opinion before you watch.<br/><br/>Where does ""Based on a true story"" mean that a director can take such liberties as to make a compelling story implausible? <br/><br/>Like the couple that take their obviously psychotic child up to an isolated and potentially hostile environment in ""The Shining,"" what could possess these parents to stay in a house where their children are experiencing harmful events? What is their cure? Bring in paranormal investigators. <br/><br/>Here's the problem: If the events were really as dramatic and frequent as those depicted, rational parents would have fled that place during the first week. If the events were really that stark, proof of ghosts would be a fait accompli and the National Inquirer would have to pay the reward. So, we know the movie is dramatized BS. <br/><br/>However, the story is compelling and surely something happened and that would have been compelling in itself. <br/><br/>But one is stuck wondering why people would stay in a house where harmful things are happening to one of the parents and the children (All girls by the way.) with regularity. By the time they leave the house, things have gotten beyond the pale so to speak. <br/><br/>The acting of all parties is pretty good and the performances are convincing but since these movies are predicated on supposedly rational people doing stupid things, This movie fits the bill exactly. Here is a daughter who is supposedly attacked but the parents seem completely oblivious. After they find her fighting a ??? and the other children seeing the thing, they obliviously ignore the incident. What? Child Protective Services wasn't nearly as intruding in 1971 as it is now but a sheriff's report would have alerted someone somewhere to investigate this family. <br/><br/>Somewhere in this mess is a conflict with the mother and daughters that could be a compelling line of inquiry but is never pursued as an avenue by either the investigators or the director. It would be interesting to discover how prevalent the ""attacks"" really were because something was obviously happening. Like the original ""Carrie"" movie being somewhat based around a girl discovering her menus and that sets off a series of events. One wonders what normal physical process might have been the genesis of these supposed ""demonic"" events. <br/><br/>Does demonic possession exist? The Catholic church has exorcists but real ""proof"" is still illusive despite anecdotal evidence to the contrary. How to prove it though. <br/><br/>Television has plenty of ""Ghost Hunter"" type shows because people are interested in seeing nothing dramatized by Bubba and Francine who are ever so brave that they face nothing. But the hope is there. Of far more interest are the ""Ghostbreakers"" posers from the ""Supernatural"" series. These wannabes are probably closer to the truth of ghost hunting than not. <br/><br/>One more thing. What is is about these movies where single women/girls walk into danger slowly? At least the father was realistic: He turned on all the lights and burst into a room to startle the demon/ghost/spectre/whatever might be lurking in the room. Girls, it seems have to walk slowly until they back into something."

Included in this family is the obligatory resentful teen who objects to the move. As well, there is the cute kid who shortly begins communications with a ""new friend"" once the family moves in. And don't forget the family dog that senses that ""something ain't quite right"". Woof! <br/><br/>This is important reader: Add a pinch of joy and optimism. After all, it's a new home and new beginning.<br/><br/>Now add a 1/2 teaspoonful of curious sh!t that may have a plausible explanation. An unpleasant odor, cold, for example.<br/><br/>This should be eventually followed by 2 table spoonfuls of full-out weird sh!t that cannot be naturally explained away. Seeing things and physical assault, for example.<br/><br/>Immediately add 1 and 1/4 table spoonfuls of panic, fear, and unhappiness, since it now looks like this promising new home and beginning has been shot to hell.<br/><br/>Now generously add 1 and 1/2 cup of desperation.<br/><br/>Quickly add 2 religious experts in the supernatural.<br/><br/>Again add a pinch of joy and optimism (The experts have arrived and the family is comforted).<br/><br/>Now add 10 pounds of terror, supernatural phenomenon, destructiveness, assault, and all-out mayhem.<br/><br/>That's it reader.

","BASED ON A TRUE STORY. Though I have no idea on up-to what extent the above quote is true, this can be classified as one of the best, if not the best, horror movie of the year.<br/><br/>However the base of the movie is from one of the main cases performed by the paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren which is named as ""The Perrons"".<br/><br/>The movies opens with a scene involving a doll named ""Annabelle"" which brings the memories of ""The Bride of Chucky"" and is the first remark to notify the viewers of what is to unfold in the next one and a half hours of a classical horror experience.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" never loses the initial momentum it gains and takes the viewers through a horrifying journey, involving a witch who has hung herself few hundred years ago, a possessed mother killing her child and so many other terrifying events. <br/><br/>The movie brings the viewers to a position where a mere slam of a door can be terrifying enough to make them jump from their seats. In keeping the viewer horrified and curious at the same time, an important feature of this movie is that it doesn't contain much gore as seen in many recent Hollywood horror movies.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, for people who crave to watch horror movies, this is a must-watch and for people who have given up on horror movies because of the gory images they contain and who are fed up with watching horror movies without a strong background story, ""The Conjuring"" is a movie worth watching."
"ersinkdotcom","9","0","1","18 October 2013"," ""The Conjuring"" has everything you could want in one supernatural film
","""The Conjuring"" is my favorite type of supernatural horror film. It has deeper meaning to it than just getting people scared. Everything about it is top shelf solid quality horror. I also applaud any movie that makes people think about the reality of God and the Devil.<br/><br/>The Perron family is terrorized by what they come to believe is a spiritual presence in their home. Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren come to the family's aid and discover that it's not only haunted but dwelled in by the demonic spirit of a witch who cursed the land she was hung on. Can the Warrens find a way to rid the house of the evil before it takes a tragic toll on the Perrons?<br/><br/>Although it's based on actual events, everyone knows ""The Conjuring"" has been sensationalized for a movie-going audience. That doesn't change the fact that it demands its audience ponder the existence of a spiritual world outside of the physical one we can see, touch, hear, and smell. It also makes a point of letting you know that just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean it's not real.<br/><br/>The biggest scares you'll get from ""The Conjuring"" aren't even necessarily the ones you'll see and hear on screen. I found myself more frightened after the film ended. I was left thinking about it in the ""real"" world. That's the beauty of a great horror film - it stays with you long after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>Let's just call it like it is. ""The Conjuring"" is the ""Amityville Horror"" of this decade. There's a lot of speculation around the Amityville house, but it's famous and put this movie's paranormal detectives in in the headlines and on TV. This is a story so fascinating that you don't want to believe it. However, somewhere in the back of your head you know it's true.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" is rated R for sequences of disturbing violence and terror. There's no nudity in the film. Some bad language can be found as well.<br/><br/>Many Christians and religious folks will no doubt disagree with demonic possession being used as a vehicle for entertainment. I look at it as an opportunity to expose and educate a generation of people who have come to believe in nothing and just live life the best they can in spiritual darkness. I know that's pretty heavy thinking put into what most look at as a horror movie.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" has everything you could want in one supernatural film. There's the old creepy house, demons, ghosts, a hanging tree, a freaky doll, and so much more. I can't think of a single genre item it missed. The funny thing is, it doesn't feel over-stuffed or like it's going to burst at the seams. It's just a good old-fashioned supernatural thriller that will entertain and make the audience ponder it well past the closing credits."

","The Conjuring introduces us to Ed and Lorraine Warren, renowned paranormal investigators and demonologists, in one of the most exciting and effective openings in horror film history.<br/><br/>It is 1971 now and Carolyn and Roger Perron are moving their family into an old Rhode Island farm house. It slows right down and continues as a typical haunted house flick until Carolyn contacts Warren Ed and Lorraine for help. Usually with horror films, the more you know of the story, the less scary things seem. With The Conjuring, the more you find out, the less you want to know.<br/><br/>Excellent performances, direction, cinematography, set-design and an epic soundtrack that the film lives up to. This is one true story that you'll wish wasn't true.<br/><br/>The Conjuring opens with an unforgettably frightening story within a series of ghost stories that make up the film. While it plays off the haunted house films of the 70's and early 80's, it goes on to surpasses them. Even if guilty of taking the best parts from all the greatest classic horror films and mixing them into one, it does so successfully thanks to the director. Between this and Insidious, James Wan has become one of the best directors working in horror and a master of haunted house stories."

","I won't lie: you're not going to see anything new in this film, in fact it follows the 'haunted house' formula almost exactly to the letter. But...if you should see only one of these type of films, you'd better make it this one. It's well crafted and has the all-important creepy atmosphere, the feeling that something evil is out there. I watched it alone in complete darkness with the volume cranked up, but even that wasn't enough to make me jump out my seat (it's probably me), but if you're squeamish, you'll have plenty of scares. I still think 'The Ring' (US version) is maybe the most creepy film I ever saw, but the Conjuring would certainly make it to my top 5."

","I haven't seen a better film than this one in a long time in this genre. The story in the film has been told many times but the way it is presented this time is very good. Like other reviews say, there are no cheap ""gotcha"" tricks in the movie. It simply builds up suspense and then delivers a bang. I have seen nearly every horror film out there and I was actually surprised a few times by this one, very rare for me.<br/><br/>What I like the most is that the balance of CGI and old fashioned make-up is well balanced here. The dark parts of the film are well placed and add exactly the right surprises. When you have seen the film go out on the internet and actually read the true stories behind the film, that's what sets the last nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>There's no massive amounts of gore or useless T&A action to evade the flaws here, just good old fashioned shock. So, if you're in the mood for a tasteful horror movie that's not boring and dull watch the film. You will not be disappointed."

I was scared by it in those places too, it is a well done possession horror movie.

In desperation, Carolyn contacts the noted paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren, to examine the house. What the Warrens discover is a whole area steeped in a satanic haunting that is now targeting the Perron family wherever they go.

","Well, this is one of the deepest exorcism movies since the 1973's classic and of the scariest since 2011's ""Paranormal Activity 3"". There are lots of scenes and situations that are similar to these films I mentioned, but there are also lots of James Wan's own ideas. There is a terrifying scene in specific that I considered well done; it was when the mother was looking for his daughter, who was in the other room, when all of a sudden someone claps from inside the closet, when, actually, there is nobody there. That scene creeped me out and remembered PA3's scene in which the nanny sees the sheet getting up, with nobody underneath. I cannot say ""The Conjuring"" brings new ideas for the genre-- that is already saturated, to say the least--, since it utilizes aspects of plenty of movies, like ""Paranormal Activity"", ""The Exorcist"", ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"", ""Dead Silence"", ""Insidious"", among others. However, I can state this is a good movie if you're looking for adult suspense gathered with horror and religion."
"freakwerks-816-316431","6","0","2","13 October 2013"," Another haunted house movie...
","Ghostly horror movies nowadays are really ultimately all kind of becoming the same. A person or family moves in or goes somewhere, and progressively paranormal stuff happens until something tragic happens to the mortals involved in the whole situation. Sadly, The Conjuring fits that template and accordingly lacks in a number of areas. First things first, I really like Lili Taylor and I really think that she is a far better actress than a lot of people credit her for. Lili plays the matriarch of the Perron family, Carolyn. She has clarity in her acting and everything she does seems so natural and organic. The patriarch of the family is Roger, played by Ron Livingston who you may remember from Office Space. This role is a big takeaway from many other roles he has done, and it is suiting because I think Ron wasn't the best choice for this role. Ron always has a sort of overly relaxed goofiness to him and it just doesn't fit well. Obviously I didn't know Roger Perron but I have a feeling that a father of 5 girls who is a trucker, would not be as relaxed as Ron seems to be all the time. The movie itself is shot very nicely, starting out bright, well lit and warm feelings. The house is often shown as a little dark, dusty and aged. The spooky spookiness really only reveals itself but once, maybe twice through the movie which is nice compared to other ghost flicks such as The Ring where you see the specter a lot. I don't want to give away the ending, but I think that it was really well done. James Wan, the director, also directed Saw and Insidious so he brings a wealth of talent and ability to The Conjuring. James is most definitely very capable of making the viewer feel the emotions as the family struggles in their battles with evil. - See more at: http://brmoments.com/2013/10/conjuring-review/"
"petarmatic","5","0","2","12 October 2013"," Classic horror film
","What to say about this film? I think that visual effects are great, Hollywood went really a long way in that. It seems that every new movie has fantastic VE. The story, eh the story. I do not believe just one bit that it is the truth. I think the Lorraine couple are cheaters like anyone else who believes in paranormal. It simply does not exist.<br/><br/>I mean they tried to make a Virgin Mary appearance a real thing in Medjugorije, but slowly as the threat of Communism wained down in the former Yugoslavia so does the story that Virgin Mary appeared in that small Herzegovina village. I know, I know they wanted some of the tourist money from the Adriatic coast to go to Medjugorije, but still, I mean Virgin Mary appeared to some young girls and talked to them, and still it like appears to them on a regular basis. Give me a break! <br/><br/>So I am of the opinion that the Lorraines are out of job with new technologies appearing, they simply do not have material to prove their stories any more. So why not end with a big bang! A Hollywood blockbuster! There is some money in it that is for sure! They should be arrested for fraud! Hollwood makers should be congratulated for making a fine and entertaining film, that is for sure. Full stop."

"jamesehlefilm","8","0","2","7 October 2013"," The Conjuring movie review
","The year is 1971, and experienced paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren have a new case on their hands in the latest horror film by New Line Cinema, ""The Conjuring"". This case is said to be so terrifying that they have refused to share it until now. The Perrons, a relatable all- American family, are moving into a new house in the middle of the country, when the strange occurrences begin to unfold. Based on a true story, this film is a roller coaster of sheer terror. The paranormal researchers, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) prefer to be addressed by their names, rather than ghost hunters, demonologists, or paranormal researchers. Together they have a young daughter, whom they care very deeply about, yet neglect to spend enough time with her due to their demanding job. Both Wilson and Farmiga put on great performances, adding to the realism, emotion and fear felt in certain scenes. Perhaps the most outstanding performance in the film was that of actress Lili Taylor who played the mother role of Carolyn Perron. A mother of five who cares for her children, whose composure steadily crumbles as the film progresses. The amount of care she shows for her children is what any good mother would feel, she's not sugar-coated or cookie-cutter perfect, but she's real, and that's what makes you believe and feel the same emotions and horrors the family is experiencing. What this film lacks in the gore and nudity department is more than reclaimed with the dark atmosphere and intensity held steadily throughout the picture, which is the reason the film received its ""R"" rating. ""The Conjuring"" is sure to please most horror fans. Director James Wan (known for directing Saw, Insidious, and Dead Silence) pays tribute to such classics as Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining"" while also keeping true to the actual haunting of the Perron family. The film is sure to scare the pants off of anyone brave enough to view it, and the story is also a nice change in pace from some of the recent box office horror movie flops. Grab a bucket of popcorn and a crucifix and go check out one of the scariest horror films of 2013!"

Though it can be argued that some of the first listed ways of parting fools from their gold are less messy and more humane than pawing through a freshly slaughtered goat's entrails, it does not change the fact that the Holy Bible itself puts the death penalty on most of what the hypocritical Ed Warren claims to be able to do (check out Seth 16:19 in particular).

"JPfanatic93","7","0","2","23 September 2013"," It's all been done before, but it all still works
","James Wan merrily continues to reinvigorate the horror genre to great effect in this spooky possession type scary flick. Though 'reinvigorate' may be said too much, as The Conjuring is driven by trite but true scare effects that have literally been employed thousands of times already. Nevertheless, Wan makes them work as if there's still a sense of novelty to them. Supposedly based on true events – with the end credits providing the necessary pictures to back up that statement – The Conjuring follows the married Warren couple specialized in demonology and paranormal investigations, which is confronted by the most shocking case of their already illustrious career. The Perron family recently moved to an old provincial house on Rhode Island, where they have been plagued by bizarre occurrences ever since their arrival, which swiftly seem to take increasingly aggressive turns. Doors slam shut on their own accord, unexplained sounds are heard everywhere, the dog died a mysterious death (even though it never even dared to enter the house) and their daughters are harassed and assaulted by unseen assailants all night long. With the balanced help of both hard science and religious ritualism, the Warrens discover the presence of several ghosts of folks that have died horrible deaths in the house over time (some of them actually sympathetic), the cause of which is a satanic presence with an appetite for child murder that won't let go of the Perrons until the blood of their girls has been shed. To put an end to this terror the Warrens must call on all their experience and lots of luck to get everyone involved, including themselves and their own kid, out of this gruesome mess alive. Naturally the evil spirit won't make it so easy for them. A synopsis like this reads like a repetition of narrative elements and age old horror themes that have been done to death. It cannot be denied that it is just that, and so are the effects Wan utilizes to scare the bejesus out of his audience. Surprisingly, it all works great nonetheless. Maybe it's his sense of timing (there's many a moment of small shocks followed by silence, which itself is shattered by a big shock), his careful employment of efficient, mood setting lighting and editing techniques, or maybe it's the convincing performances delivered by his cast, with Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson making ghostbusting exorcists feel plausible and compelling. It's probably the whole. Despite this movie's failure to come up with wholly new concepts to the horror genre, instead embracing all the clichés people have come to associate withe the genre, The Conjuring proves a genuine scarefest from beginning to end, guaranteed to oblige both regular viewers out for an evening of thrills and die-hard horror lovers who gave up on Hollywood's tactics ages ago. Hopefully this movie will stay a standalone film, instead of soon being the victim of rapid enfranchisement as happened all too easily to Wan's Saw – to detrimental plot effects, though unfortunately not so much in terms of box office– which currently also seems to be the case with Insidious, to which Wan just released a sequel as well (it's a fruitful year for him apparently). The Conjuring is a good old-fashioned horror film which brings to mind all the similarly themed classics of old (though of course not getting anywhere near the shock level of, say, The Exorcist), but shouldn't be exploited ad infinitum as some of Wan's other movies have been, for its own benefit. You can only be reminded of how creepy a door can be so many times before the feeling of dread is getting stale."

","I must admit from the outset I was totally caught up in this whirlwind hype of the latest horror movie from director James Wan, a director that clearly knows how to build up tension in his movies. So with its notably high box office earnings and rating that The Conjuring has received on IMDb, I was optimistic that James Wan had created another spine chilling masterpiece.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though I have to say I was disappointed with his approach to script and direct another Amtyville horror and Exorcism clone. Even though the setting was good, the acting was mediocre at best, the tension that builds up to the scares have been done before in so many other movies, it made me feel like I was watching clones of other movies-that feeling of Déjà vu.<br/><br/>Sometimes watching a reminiscent piece of filmmaking from a fresh new director can be a good or bad thing, however The Conjuring lies somewhere in-between of being good and just average. Granted, the Conjuring, didn't rely on the overuse of blood which is typical of the horror genre to produce those moments of looking away from the screen. James Wan inevitably keeps the camera shifting through POV (point of view) with some of the characters, uses tight angles and subtle zooming techniques to define the tension that keeps the audience interested throughout the running time.<br/><br/>Many critics and movie enthusiasts rave about the Conjuring cinematography, inventive direction and musical score. To note, the best cinematography and musical score in a horror genre is still Silent Hill. The creepiness of an evil looking doll was done better in the excellent (though underrated) psychological horror ""May"" released in 2002. The tension build up has also been done better in Japanese filmmaking which have become more mainstream through the remakes of ""The Ring"" and ""The Grudge"" where blood and gore is minimal and the dark atmosphere of those movies with sharp direction are used to full effect to pull of terrifying moments.<br/><br/>I'm in the minority in saying this movie has great potential of being a classic, just like his directorial debut with Saw almost 10 years ago, with its modest budget allowance, great script, superb acting and directing with an extraordinary climax to match. The Conjuring though is merely hiding in the shadows of other movies waiting to be extraordinary."

","The Conjuring is indeed a very, very positive surprise. I would honestly say that director James Wan succeeded in what could be called an Exorcist of current times. What makes it so good and original is that it presents a classic horror haunted house style for the first half (in a very well directed fashion, camera is perfect, such as color), then studies and analyses that horror through Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga's characters: a couple of expert ""demonologists"". So, James Wan focuses on ambiance, suggestion, and, most importantly, characters (Lili Taylor is very well also), and is able to reenact the mood of the 80's horror is a very effective and entertaining fashion. Well done! Check out thefadingcam blog for more reviews!"

","I had least expectations of the movie when I went in to see 'The Conjuring'. Yet, the movie stumped me with its gripping storyline, good choice of acting cast and a neatly set pace. I could sense the tension build up inside me as the movie progressed somewhere down the middle. Director James Wan has ensured that the audience get a peek view on the Perron and Warren families at the start of the movie as also on the sinister events that is set to come. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as the Warrens and Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor as the Perrons are absolutely into the skin of their characters.<br/><br/>In horror stories, the perfect blending of thrills with chills is primarily aided by very good cinematography. Cinematography has been very well done here.

"RolltheClip","8","0","1","9 September 2013"," Films still go bump in the night
","When a trailer pushes 'Based on a true story' as it's first selling point, prior to even showing footage, it always makes me very weary of the final product. Gone are the days where this is a major selling point for a film where I am concerned. It's an over-used marketing technique that can often keep the small-minded filling the seats. Although the film may well be based on a true story, if you look into it. It doesn't matter how vaguely it resembles the actual happenings. They can still use the term as long as they keep a slight connection such as names. Regardless, after having positive word of mouth ignored my doubts and went to see the film.<br/><br/>The final product was completely dissimilar to the way it was portrayed in the trailer. It wasn't a documentary, but it also wasn't the standard exorcism film that I went in expecting it to be. It was a really pleasant surprise after seeing so many weak attempts in recent years as many people fail at achieving the greatness and controversy that films such as 'The Exorcist' produced.In 1971, the Perron family relocate to Rhode Island with their five daughters. When they come across a basement which had been concealed for a decade, they disturb many restless spirits and unmask a history of murders within the vicinity of their house. A series of outbreaks occur to them, leading them to contact leading investigators of the paranormal, Ed and Lorraine Warren to aid them in ending their torment. The house is found to be a congregation for the damned and an exorcism is vital if the family are to remain safe.<br/><br/>'The Conjuring' really surpassed expectations as its scares, on the most part, were more suggestive instead of just opting for copious bloodshed. However, there were a considerable amount of moments which made the audience jump out of their seats. The cinema screening I went to seemed incredibly loud and it really added to the atmosphere as the music had such effective crescendos and really let the film get inside of your head.<br/><br/>One of the most impressive buildups didn't even make the audience jump, instead, it makes you anticipate being frightened, only to then not deliver it. It misleads you to believe that the final shock will be predictable and then completely turns the table and it really felt like a final, cheeky wink.<br/><br/>It also avoids the typical issues that exorcism films often fall for in that the exorcism scene doesn't drag out for too long. I find others can over-do it until the scene loses momentum and this was suitably short, but strong. I loved the claustrophobia and helplessness in the scene as well as there is an intense chase through the crawl space of their home. It's rather distressing as you really feel the helplessness of the family but it would have been much more sufficient if they had developed the daughters more as none of them are particularly distinguishable. None really feel that significant other than being a plot device and you don't have the chance to connect with them.<br/><br/>It could have gone more in depth with the investigators home life as the doll excelled at creating an ambiance and putting the viewers on edge although they didn't really use it to it's full potential. I would have liked to have seen more although the relic room in the Warren house is a gold mine of potential sequels and/or prequels. I expected the doll to have more of a significance within the film but perhaps they will give it more attention in the sequel which has already been announced.<br/><br/>Minor gripes aside this really is a film that is in its element when watched at the cinema as it aims straight for the jugular from it's opening scene until the credits roll, ensuring palms remain sweaty, along with heart rates as it keeps the thrills frequent. Whilst they could have expanded on some of the family life, the length of the film was adequate as it never ceases to keep the audiences attention."
"estebangonzalez10","9","0","1","8 September 2013"," The best horror film of this millennium
","""The devil exists. God exists. And for us, as people, our very destiny hinges on which we decide to follow.""<br/><br/>James Wan has always been a hit or a miss for me as a director considering I was a big fan of Saw, but really hated Dead Silence. When The Conjuring began I was fearing the worst seeing that a doll was involved once again, but fortunately it was just part of a prologue and the main story was about a haunted house. So my next thought was: OK we've seen this scenario played out a million times before in horror films and I'm not a huge fan of spirit demon possession movies. So once again, I had my doubts about this film because I was sure I'd seen it all before and it wasn't really my thing. But I was wrong once again, because this film absolutely blew me away once the main characters were introduced and the story began creeping me out. The Conjuring is nearly a perfect film and in my humble opinion this is the best horror film of this millennium. Wan has made one of the creepiest films I've seen and I found myself feeling goosebumps all over my body during several scenes. The mood and 70's setting worked really well here and the characters were surprisingly all likable as well. The silence in this film worked really well and the score also added to the overall effectiveness in this movie. The best thing about The Conjuring is that Wan didn't go for cheap jump scares, he created a genuine and effective eerie atmosphere that had me tense during the entire film. The performances were all great as well (something that is difficult to find in the horror genre) and the camera work was unbelievable (I recall a masterful scene where one of the young kids senses a presence in her room and looks under the bed with the camera following her point of view). But what I loved the most about The Conjuring is that the film didn't have to use gore in order to shock the audience; Wan managed to scare us with the classical horror film techniques of the old days. This was one of the funnest experiences I've had in the movies this year.<br/><br/>The film claims to be based on true events revolving around a Rhode Island family that experienced strong supernatural activity in their new home. Famous paranormal investigators, Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson), were called to help this family. The Conjuring is a retelling of what the Warren's found in the house. Roger (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) are a very lovely and hard working couple. They have five beautiful daughters: Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). Due to their financial struggles they believe this cheap big old house could be a new start for them, but they begin to experience some strange events. First, their dog refuses to enter the house and the next morning they find him dead. All the clocks in the house stopped at 3:07. April, the youngest, begins speaking to an imaginary friend, and Christine begins feeling something pulling her leg at night. Several strange things continue to occur in the home which leave Carolyn no other choice than to look for these famous paranormal investigators and ask them to help them. After just one visit, the Warrens realize there is definitely a dangerous demonic presence in the home. They promise to help, but the secrets hidden in this house and the threat might even be too menacing for the Warrens to undertake. <br/><br/>The Conjuring is really well crafted despite the familiar genre and premise. The film kind of surprised me in that it never tried to manipulate the audience with the score. Actually the scariest scenes occur mostly in silence, and when the music begins to play and you expect some sort of scare usually something silly happened to lighten the mood (the scene that comes to mind here is when a door moves and everyone expects to see the ghost manifest itself, but it was actually an investigator coming out of a bathroom). I found the film to be very creepy and I must say that when I went to bed later that night I made sure that my feet were well tucked in under the blankets so that nothing pulled my legs. The film succeeds as a horror story and it really delivers several scares that stick with you long after the movie is over. I think The Conjuring is a modern masterpiece and it might be The Exorcist of this generation. Wan is so good building suspense in this film and making the audience care for the characters. I loved his long tracking shots and the moments of silence that just added to the overall tension the movie made me feel. I will never forget the silence coming from the audience after the movie ended as if they were still trying to loosen up from all the tension built up in this nearly two hour film. Wan tells this story with such a retro vibe and simple techniques that even clapping hands scared the heck out of me. The Conjuring is intense and everything I look for when I want to see a scary movie. If you think you've seen it all and nothing can scare you, you might want to give The Conjuring a view because it could surprise you."

","Despite hating the title, and thinking it all looked like the usual ""little girl ghost"" kind of stuff, I went to see ""The Conjuring"" fairly recently, and was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Maybe I shouldn't of been. Its from the same people that brought us ""Sinister"" and ""Paranormal activity."" Horror movies that prey on psychologically freaked out viewers such as myself.<br/><br/>It all sounds vaguely familiar though. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga play paranormal investigators who are called to the aid of a genuinely terrified family, as they start experiencing strange and spooky stuff going on in their new home. Which of course they can't leave because they've just spent a fortune moving there.<br/><br/>What could have been a pretty standard haunted house movie though is given a boost by being a sometimes genuinely scary haunted house movie. After we get all of the usual doors slamming and stuff floating around rubbish out of the way, this one shows signs of some promise. Plus I had a good time at the cinema with this one. Everyone there seemed to enjoy it, and there haven't been that many times at the cinema where everyone was really getting freaked out by the same movie. I was loving some of the atmosphere on this one. One that will get remembered as a great night out this."

Another good thing to look forward to is that museum which to me is a never ending source of future story telling entertainment and further disturbing ghost story movies. A sequel is planned BTW. I personally am not bothered by the evil in this picture which is mature and relentless because I have a good understanding on how and why it really works.

"FSfilmblog","9","0","2","5 September 2013"," Another impressive horror from director James Wan
","I finally got round to watching The Conjuring the other day and my word, was it impressive. It reminded me a lot of the old horror films I use to watch when I was younger. A lot of jump scares and quiet then loud moments but the overall the film succeeds because of it's use of older and simpler techniques. I think a lot of modern audiences have forgotten how to feel scared.<br/><br/>The story is based on a true story(!) about a family moving into a new home where strange occurrences start to befall the family members. They contact a paranormal team wife and husband Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) to investigate. What the couple encounter is something more deadlier than they could ever imagined. <br/><br/>With all types of movies based on true stories, as an audience member you can either believe everything you see as fact or take it with a pinch of salt. If you take the former belief then the movie may take on more meaning and shocks and scares may make you feel more....well uneasy. Though saying that if you are a non believable, the story can still provide you with feeling of unease and creepiness.<br/><br/>What works well in this entertaining yarn is it's ability to surprise you with jumps and scares that you think are coming then don't and when they do, it's executed very well. As a fan of the genre I found myself jumping at few choice moments (even though I could tell they something was about to happen). Some of the scares come from implied/suggestive moments like in one scene where two of the daughters are woken up by something and one of the daughters believe that that thing is behind the door, and as an audience member you imagination runs wild as you wait for something to come out only for the door to slam shut and for your heart to miss a beat. It's a cheap trick but very effective. There is little to no gore in this film so gore hounds will be very disappointed. <br/><br/>The acting is uniformly strong in this film with everyone playing their parts straight and with conviction. The director has done his homework too and uses old tricks from classic horror films which he implements with a assurance and aplomb. For those of you who haven't seen old school horror films, this will be a great introduction, and for those of you who have, you can fondly remember how we all use to be scared at the things that go bump in the night and the darkness that lie in the corners of every room."
"ThePhantomMovieBuff","8","0","2","5 September 2013"," Look what you made me do...
","James Wan, director of such films as Insidious, Saw, Dead Silence and the upcoming Insidious Chapter 2, has made quite a name for himself after reaching critical success in his frightful horror flicks, which have been praised by both critics and movie-goers alike. Based on a true (and most terrifying) case of demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) , The Conjuring display's Wan's talent in the genre, as well as scarring us with a fear of what lies within our wardrobes. <br/><br/>The main thing to grasp with The Conjuring is that if you're a horror fan, you have seen most of this before. You've seen door's move on their own, you've heard eerie creeping noises in the same old, run down house, and you've most likely seen some form of exorcism one way or the other from countless movies out there (although you've probably cleared the bad memories from tiresome exorcism film The Devil Inside). Despite the horror traits/clichés that do appear more than every so often in The Conjuring, the film remains to be highly shocking and succeeds in scaring it's audience. <br/><br/>Opening with an unnerving scene revolving around an old Warren case featuring a haunting china doll, the story soon moves onto Rodger and Carolyn Perron (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) and their four daughters, Andrea, Nancy, Christine and Cindy (Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy and Kyla Deaver) who move into their new but slightly run down house in the countryside. It doesn't take long until the boarded up basement is discovered and the paranormal stuff begins to occur, and at this point you begin to wonder if this film is offering nothing more than a rehash of the most well known horror traits. Well, you're right, only The Conjuring works these traits so well it makes them feel like whole new scares, and they never intend on slowing down. It builds and builds from one scare to the next as well as making time to develop the characters so that we care about them (the biggest example being the romance and passion in the paranormal with Ed and Lorraine), which is something horror films seem to be lacking lately. The Conjuring does what it sets out to do and raises the bar to all future upcoming horror movies, and, with previously mentioned Insidious Chapter 2 on the way, one can only imagine what it is that James Wan has in store next.<br/><br/>My Verdict: A suspenseful, highly well crafted horror story based on the most kept hidden paranormal case file keeps up the scares and proves to be a real treat for anyone looking for a good fright."

","For a movie about haunted house, a style that's been nearly beaten to death since the 1970's with films like: Amity ville Horror, Haunting, Paranormal Activity,etc.(I could be here all night) The Conjuring not only manages to stick out from the crowd but exceeds expectations.<br/><br/>I think this has a lot to do with James Wan's growth as a horror director. Having directed the already classic first Saw film and others such as Dead Silence and Insidious you can really tell there's a lot of experimenting in different ways to an old genre. Plus it helps create his style, which makes people become distinct(like his use of dolls and Patrick Wilson)<br/><br/>But what can really be appreciated in this movie compared to Wan's other films; lets say Insidious,(where a boy becomes linked to demons and effects his home and family)is this film is treating it's audience completely differently. What that means is The Conjuring relies on not only the acting, but the atmosphere like the music, the feeling of being watched, and gradual build up making you wait for that big moment or reveal. Which honestly is what makes it so exciting. <br/><br/>The conjuring isn't a movie that aims for creepy costumes and jump scares, it wants to stick in your head and fester there. It wants to scare adults, where as for me personally felt Insidious was trying to scare children.<br/><br/>What's also to appreciate is you become invested in the Perron family being attacked and also the Warren's in the danger they face too. There's a very small amount a second-banana characters to put up with, so the movie never slows down in it's pacing or get's distracted. Another thing to know about the movie is there is no big reveal, and it doesn't end on some cheap cliff hanger like most horror movies this day and age do. What you see is what you get. <br/><br/>Some peoples have gripes that a haunted house film is an overused idea, it recycles movies, and maybe even shoves religious overtones down peoples throats a little bit. But keep in mind this story is, ""based"" on ""true events"". And complaining that a movie about a haunted house is similar to other haunted house films, is like complaining porn always having boobs in it--it's ridiculous.<br/><br/>I think it's not only a great new horror movie but it beats out a lot of it's older competition.Check it out if your into suspense and creepy or if you're getting sick of slasher films and need a break."

","Well it's a masterpiece from James wan. Simply one of the best scary movie. Best thing about the movie is its base on a true story. you would love it more when you will feel in the shoes of those story characters who goes through in such situation I mean Perron family. Retro style makes it more unique and no CGI effects makes it an exceptional masterpiece. It's R rated just because of its horror scenes. Very impressive job has been done by all actors. i think this is best movie of James Wan. The best part is hide and clap game after watch this in movie I will never play this game.Well I suggest to everyone who love horror movies to go and watch it. You will love it.

","""The Conjuring"" is horror well made that earns it's R-rating solely based on terror without any sex, gore or cuss words. It's a welcome change from the overused and hence clichéd ""found footage"" genre. Set in 1971, paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren are approached by a mother whose family is being tormented by a demonic presence in their new home. It doesn't take long for the Warren's to get sucked right in the sinister situation. Unlike most horror flicks these days where the evil spirit crawls across the walls and ceiling wearing white, ""The Conjuring"" does not show much and builds on the greatest fear on mankind - fear of what they can't see. The acting, screenplay, sound and set design is very fitting too. My advice? Be prepared for your popcorn to drop if you go in with one."

","I just saw The Conjuring yesterday and I regret seeing it at a late timing because i could not stay in my room in the dark for 5 minutes that night remembering all that I saw in the movie back then.<br/><br/>I am stunned by how the director sifts through your flesh and blood and pours all the malice of the dark presence lurking in that house into your blood stream and it leaves with you as you leave the showroom.It is neat and that is what I call a horrifying horror movie that encompasses all the elements of fear itself.It is the second most disturbing horror movie I ever saw after the demonic Emily Rose which I dare not speak of or watch in full length.<br/><br/>I was so terrified of the movie I left before it ended right before the exorcism scene because my nerves can only take so much. I was baffled when I was told that the director is the same one who directed Saw,because this one and the Saw sagas is a total different level. This movie is a must see ,in our lives we have to see this *one really scary*movie and I think the Conjuring would be it.No harrowing or gruesome scenes ,no blood baths no sex scenes,perfectly executed and very very bone chilling.Very well done I enjoyed it very much until I slipped out the back ,I was content with hearing what happened from my friends."
"hkauteur","8","0","2","1 September 2013"," HK Auteur Review - The Conjuring
","Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren work to help a family terrorized by a dark presence in their farmhouse.<br/><br/>The fact that The Conjuring is based on a true story is competently incorporated into the film's design. James Wan takes his time with his world creation and properly sets up a believable reality. These characters act like real people. Most people wouldn't be quick to jump to the conclusion that their house is haunted and it would realistically take a while for a family to seek help. I couldn't spot anybody making stupid horror movie mistakes. The initial scares did not scare me, but step-by-step the scares put me into the world. As I understood the science and how these ghosts worked, my mental defenses begun to weaken and I began dreading the scares.<br/><br/>Wan uses every trick in the book for the scares, but they are effectively scary. Judging it from a pure horror film fan's view, the design of the scares by themselves are probably not that fresh. But it's genetically encoded together with the story in such a way that if you were to show one of the film's scary sequences on Youtube to a friend, the actual scare will be dampened without the context of the story.<br/><br/>The best thing The Conjuring achieves is that it properly balances the horror movie genre elements with its dramatic portions. It does so by focusing on Ed and Lorraine Warren, who are fascinating larger-than-life characters and are the heart of the story. Watching the paranormal investigators set up their ghost hunting equipment and explaining how ghosts behave was equally entertaining as any of the film's fright sequences. Where in a typical horror movie that will rely on its scares to entertain the audience, The Conjuring has an interesting real-life story and characters that we can not only be scared by, but also speculate and ponder long after the scares are over. The Warrens are the X factor what will unite horror film fans and a typical movie goer to enjoying this movie on multiple levels. I immediately Googled the Warrens after seeing the film and read about their other real-life paranormal investigations. I am glad the studio has decided to make a sequel with Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga playing these characters again.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit my film blog @ http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"

","""The Conjuring"" is by far the best horror films I have seen in recent times and one of my favorites. It contained elements of surprise, suspense and was thrilling from beginning to end, so much that when it ended, you wanted to see more! There were many unexpected 'jump' moments that enhanced the experience of it and also had a story that had you on the edge of your seat wanting to see more. This is the only movie I've seen where people actually left the show, blocking their ears and running out! The movie held my interest for the entire duration of it. Excited for part 2! This is by far ""the most terrifying film that I have experienced"", not ""Evil Dead"""
"josephledbury","8","0","2","1 September 2013"," The most Terrifying Cinema experience ever!
","I've been waiting to watch this film for months. And last night I went to the cinema and did exactly that. I think I crapped my pants. The most terrifying part about the movie is that it's based on true events, and what makes it even worse is that in the credits there are pictures of the people the movie is based on and it says which actor played who.<br/><br/>The first thing I noticed that's so good about this movie is it's cinematography. It was brilliant and the cameras movement makes the atmosphere more scary and improves the scares as it's angles I noticed were a bit more different than most ghost stories. It's got an actor who I recognised straight away, Patrick Wilson, who was in Insidious. Very talented actor who has a knack for ghost stories and this being probably the best movie i've seen him in.<br/><br/>In my view there are two kind of scares and those are jump scares which is when something makes you jump usually based on the noise and this scare usually doesn't stay with you for the rest of your life and carry on scaring you. The other kind of scare is one I like to call a lasting scare. This is the kind of scare that is something that will stay with you for the rest of your life for example in the movie Insidious that ghost of an old woman was the most frightening look i've ever seen and it still continues to haunt my mind three years after watching it and I probably won't forget it so it is something that haunts your mind (not literally of course) for a long time and maybe forever. This movie had a lot of both. Scary faces, jump scares, loud jump scares that just turns out to have a rational explanation and most of all a character who which is so frightening that I couldn't look at her(and that character is the main one who you probably won't forget)<br/><br/>It wasn't only a movie about a haunted house but it had a religious meaning storyline as well. Envolving Exorcisms and plenty of religious content based on the Christian faith. There is insults to the Christian faith and their believers.<br/><br/>Overall this is the scariest movie i've watched since the 1973 movie The Exorcist. Brilliant Cinematography based on new angles and new ways of filming, good acting and generally just a new take on the haunted house genre. A must watch for horror fans and it's not even that violent or gory so a lot of non-horror fans can watch but i will say it's very intense and plenty of frightening scenes but other than that still a brilliant movie."

","Director James Wan has impressed me with his scary movies before, but this one blew me away. From the opening shot to the very end of the film you'll be gripping your seat and waiting for the next thing to happen. The director uses a variety of different scares and pulls them off perfectly in a very realistic story of a family putting everything into their new home which happens to be haunted. The acting is great, the story is great, and its a movie worth seeing over and over. The thing thats great about this movie is there's no sex, no language, and hardly any blood. Its rated R just because it is scary!!! I feel this movie was perfectly executed and is a masterpiece of the Horror genre!"
"Lucabrasisleeps","9","0","2","31 August 2013"," The Conjuring
","I don't like to watch horror films in theaters because of the stupid reactions from people. Also horror movies are not released here often.<br/><br/>But this one I had to see. I do seem to like the new generation of filmmakers such as James wan, Ti west and the guy who made Sinister. So I couldn't miss this.<br/><br/>I would say, for one thing, this was a good theater experience. The people started off making crude jokes and all. But as the movie progressed, the reactions by the audience were totally appropriate. No crappy jokes, people were totally engrossed by what was going on. That was a refreshing change from what I normally see.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. I love the way the first half progressed. The build up was amazing. I love the scene where the daughter stands on the stairs. It was so sudden and the build up to it was amazing. It is stuff like that I prefer rather than the over the top exorcism stuff. The first half has many such moments which are quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>In the second half, the movie speeds up. But it is only towards the end we have the totally over the top stuff with the exorcisms and so on. Pretty impressive jump scares as well. I guess the capable acting performances are a highlight. It helps to have really talented actors.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't bring anything new, to be honest but that never bothered me. I just wanted to have a good time and this movie really hits the spot."

","This movie had its moments. When the demon went after Judy, I started to freak out. I thought she would get hurt or worst. I've seen better scary movies, but I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see a good scary/mystery. I do have to say that until 2014 this movie isn't the best scary movie of the year. I mean its only August. When its 2014 and none of the other upcoming scary movies are better, then I will see this movie as the best scary movie of the year. If you're looking for a good scary movie with a decent plot, you should watch this movie. I'm always disappointed when a scary movie doesn't have a good plot. They just kill the characters without development. If I wanted to see a movie with just killing, I would just watch Final Destination, the one's after the second one."
"LloydBayer","8","0","2","28 August 2013"," To Hell and Back.
","Not since THE EXORCIST (1973) has a horror film been this effective. If you could bottle an atmosphere of dread, suspense and terror, and sell it to the whole world, the label on that bottle would read THE CONJURING. Director James Wan has done just that. That being said, when it comes to the horror genre, Hollywood has been peddling various versions of this bottle for decades. Typically, Hollywood horror films have always had precious little to offer other than survival horror that relies on excessive bloodletting, and this – demonic possession or human casualties caught up in the eternal war between Heaven and Hell. <br/><br/>Starting with SAW and then INSIDIOUS, Wan is not new to horror movies. But while he was merely flexing his muscles with those films, THE CONJURING is a film assembled piece by piece, where each piece is a meticulously crafted block of shock. Using an old school template of retro scare tactics, Wan ups the ante (and the hairs on your neck) by narrating what is supposed to be a true story, which until now, was hushed by skeptics. Set in 1971 Rhode Island, the epilogue introduces us to Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), real life demonologists who lecture university students when they are not investigating paranormal behavior. They even have a large room full of relics from their ghost-busting escapades to the effect that Ed feels it's best to keep evil locked up collectively, than let loose individually. It is at one of these lectures when they meet Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston), new owners of an old farmhouse. Within hours of moving into their dream home, the Perrons and their five daughters experience increasing malevolence that leads them to seek out the Warrens. Despite being regarded as experts in their field, nothing can prepare the Warrens for what happens next. <br/><br/>Based on multiple interviews with the real Lorraine Warren, sibling screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes' story is straight forward and well paced, while also allowing viewers to breathe thanks to some will timed wit. I wouldn't call this humor, rather perfectly timed breaks that prepare you for the next fright scene. And while most of the cast are well suited for the story, Taylor stands out in illustrating the Warren's three-step theory on demonic possession – Infestation, Oppression and Possession. Personally, I was expecting all the action to come from Wilson and Farmiga, and even as they deliver, Taylor's Lili becomes the central character in a manner that justifies why this story had to be told. <br/><br/>Owing to a setup that is not the most original, THE CONJURING does have its flaws and horror fans will run through the clichés with repetition and familiarity; a big house that a realtor will give away for a steal; kids talking to people no one can see; banging doors and frosty whispers; it's all there and it's safe to say that Wan has borrowed some of the best moments from classic horror films and thrown it all into a huge cauldron. But it works. Using lingering moments of deliberate silence and scaring you with things you don't actually see, Wan's slow build up is an unending reign of terror even when you know what to expect. And if some of the early scares seem cheap, this is only a warning for viewers to brace themselves for the heart-stoppers saved for later. These moments are cranked up with menacing background music and a nerve racking sound design engineered to raise those goose bumps.<br/><br/>As modern horror movies go, it takes a lot to scare people who have seen everything from Hitchcock's PSYCHO (1960) to the recent remake of THE EVIL DEAD. It also goes without saying that expectations are now inversely proportional to a rising level of skepticism. Even so, that is no excuse to underestimate this film. There is a reason why THE CONJURING has an R rating (Restricted Viewing - Children under 17 require parent or adult guardian) even though there is no sexual content or profanity, with little blood and violence. Besides being labeled as a true story, Wan's narration, build-up and the overall atmosphere generated can get under your skin. Quite literally, this film can take you to hell and back. Just ensure it's not a one way trip!"
"snele90","8","0","2","28 August 2013"," Slow and steady ... scares the living daylight out of me.
","Okay, so I went into this movie without seeing the trailer or even knowing what it's about. I prefer to see horror movies without knowing what to expect out of them because it makes it more exciting for me, even if the movie ends up sucking.<br/><br/>Having said that, I really liked this movie! I actually think it is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long while! And I don't mean horror as in gore and jump scares ... I mean good quality horror that had a build up and when it scared me ... it scared me! But then, to be fair, despite being a big horror movie buff there's nothing that scares me easier than ghosts. :)<br/><br/>At first the movie seemed slow and uninteresting but the more I watched the more I wanted to know what was actually happening in that house and was not disappointed! The fact that they played with the whole haunted house a little and didn't go just like ""BAM! GHOSTS! DEAL WITH IT!"" was really amusing. I liked the variety in which the haunting is presented. <br/><br/>Yeah, I think the conclusion is that I liked the movie. A lot. Not to say it will become a ""cult classic"" or anything ... I just liked it for what it was!"
"forthosewhowait94","9","0","2","27 August 2013"," Absolutely terrifying!
","The Conjuring is one of the best horror movies I have seen in a long time! It has all the right elements to make a great horror movie: old house, a family, creepy kids, scary dolls, weird noises, and a sad story. Unlike most horror movies nowadays, this film does not rely too much on jump-scares. Actually there are very few jump-scares in this movie. In my personal opinion, I feel like too many horror movies these days relies on jump-scares alone to make their movies seem more scary and to me it kind of takes away the horror element. Another thing I really liked about this movie is the fact that there is hardly any violence or gore. I feel like they are coming out with too many slasher movies that claim to be ""scary"" but they rely too much on blood and guts which isn't really that scary. It is just really gross and disgusting.<br/><br/>There is no sex, drugs, or language which is another thing I liked about this movie. The movie has a fantastic horror element to it and when me and my boyfriend went to see it in the theatre, I held onto him for dear life because the movie was just that frightening. When I got home later that night, I went to bed with the lights on and I kept tucking my feet under my blankets! The cast was really good in this film and they all played their parts well! This movie is up there with horror movies like The Shining, The Exorcist, and Polterguist. It is a fantastic terrifying horror movie! A++++++"

","I went to a surprise screening and was very happy to see that the movie was The Conjuring. I saw the trailer the other day and was pretty impressed, so I was keen to see the movie. However in the end I feel The Conjuring lacked something. There weren't many scary scenes, even though they were sophisticated. Still, you'll be able to find some scenes when you think ""Really???"". I liked the actors, especially Patrick Wilson's character who looked very reassuring throughout the movie and actually put some confidence in scary scenes. There are some jokes, some ""cool"" scenes, i.e. when they are installing gadgets in the house and some our generation energetic electronic plays in the background. I think they should have concentrated a bit more on a horror part, because especially in the second part of the movie it becomes more like an action/adventure. Overall - a very decent movie that still could have been a bit better. 8/10."
"julia162","7","0","2","27 August 2013"," A good horror that will definitely lead to a sleepless night or two!
","**May contain spoilers** The story is mostly your classic horror story line - house haunted by a hell bent spirit who has latched on the main characters (the Perrons) and the Demonologists(the Warrens)come to help them out - with a few extras thrown in.Which is good because this leaves enough room for the viewer to focus on the things they came for - the scares! Though there were some things I felt were unnecessary and irrelevant to the story line, my prime example being the scene in which Judy Warren is haunted by the doll Annabelle, and, in fact the presence of Annabelle herself. I also felt that despite I thought her part in the film a little pointless, the director should have made Annabelle's portrayal more realistic. Annabelle the doll does exist and is in fact a large, quite cute rag doll and I feel this would have been scarier than the classic creepy porcelain type doll they went with instead. Still on the subject of the story line, I also felt that there were parts that could have been made more of, for example, more of the back story of the previous owners of the land and more of the ""Look what she made me do."" - especially the maid Brad sees in the house. I thought the jump scares were brilliant, my only criticism being that for me there sheer amount of jumps scares - one after another after another - made me feel almost bogged down, but others may prefer the constant 'on edge' feeling you get whilst watching a good horror. I really did enjoy the scene in which the witch first possesses Carolyn, the method of her possession was very different from the classic inhaling black smoky kind. It was close, and loud, and that whole regurgitating blood thing really was terrifying. The exorcism scene at the end was equally terrifying. The witch's face appearing in the rip in the sheet, the blood and the animal-istic look in possessed Carolyn's eyes when she goes off to get April. Over all a film filled with lots of good ol' scares - definitely a keeper."

The Conjuring gave me something that i think was missing in recent horror films: a real scare. It was perfect the way they build up the tension from the first scene and throughout the development of the movie. Of course one of the main ingredients is that it's based on a true story, but you automatically immerse yourself in the story that the only thing relevant is what they put you on the screen an d what you feel.

","The Conjuring is stylish old fashion horror movie. It is strange combination of The Amityville horror and The Exorcist. Movie doesn't invoke digital effects and macabre violence like so many present horror movie does. It acquiesce more traditional horror effects. Suspension tightens stylishly up to the end and there is surprisingly lack of blood to be a horror movie. Picture of the 70's time is staged elegantly and it brings eccentric old feeling to this movie. Brooding tense is created cleverly using dark, waiting and suitable horror element. Sound and picture telling feels like straight from the best 70's and 80's horror movies. The Conjuring is stylish old fashioned horror movie, the one you don't want to watch alone at remote farm house in a dark fall night.

Despite those who can only enjoy a horror movie with buckets of blood/excessive language/sex & nudity, I absolutely love this movie. The atmosphere, the characters, there is something to scare everyone & unlike most, actually has an ending I can enjoy. It has excellent spooky elements that reminded me of some of my favorite scary movies when I was a kid, without the sadism of so many so-called horror movies of today.

It ticks all the haunted-house horror-show stories with a brief nod at exorcism films.<br/><br/>Good acting, exceptional horror direction and a real attempt to connect the audience to the characters (good script and decent actors for a change) make this well above the norm for the horror genre.<br/><br/>So is it anything groundbreaking? Definitely not. Is it a fun night out that delivers actual scares? Oh my yes. Probably the scariest part is the prologue about Annabel but that's OK. The film still managed to sustain an atmosphere of unease throughout and I was quite happy. Plus, a scary prologue goes a LONG way in a horror movie, as anyone who saw the original ""Halloween"" where the first 5 minutes are by far the scariest can tell you.<br/><br/>I think the word I am looking for here is ""competent"" but that's not often a given in the horror world.<br/><br/>p.s. As for the ""based on a true story"" stuff. Uh-huh. Sure. Whatever you say."
"movieman89-2","8","0","2","20 August 2013"," Wann is one of our saviours of modern horror
","I saw the trailer and read things about this and saw that it was done by James Wann, who I'm a large fan of and it was instantly on my watch list. I then went to see it and I have to say one word first of all...awesome!!.<br/><br/>The plot was original and extremely effective. Yeah of course we seen family moves to new house and something goes wrong etc, but with the added bonus of the demonic witch, which again is very original and unique because I've never seen, in movies, a spirit who's a witch. It worked brilliantly. I also noticed the references of The Amityville Horror with the bad smells and the cold air which fit in really well with the story. You can tell Wann's a fan. I did notice that this wasn't a run of the mill jump scare movie. Yes it did have the odd jump moments but there were moments of when you're expected to jump and nothing happened which I love. Don't expect scare scenes all the time cause this is a slow burner, which I love and I reckon us horror fans, we need more of.<br/><br/>The acting was great and character development worked very well. Again it's a slow burner so we get a lot of time to know everyone. <br/><br/>Cinematography and camera-work were brilliant. Wann used very effective angles. Especially a scene involving one of the daughters looking under her bed, the camera completely flips over which I've never seen before.<br/><br/>The scare scenes are very subtle by not showing any detail which I always love. There were times where you do see the witch but only for a split second. Why don't they use this effect in horror anymore. I wouldn't say its as scary as everyone says it is but there are times where it really gave me the creeps.<br/><br/>Overall a great movie. James Wann has once again brought back original horror. But using a modern style. Horror fans this is one for you. Highly recommended. I actually cannot wait for the second chapter of Insidious. It actually looks like that it can work. Well its James Wann, what do we expect<br/><br/>:D"
"chatterjee-siddhartha77","8","0","2","20 August 2013"," Must watch with a crucifix
","If someone wants to take a break from his/her Sweet Dreams and opting for some bad nightmares ..then definitely this should be the pick. Can be tagged as the one of the rare gems in the horror genres. With minimal CGI effects the screenplay turns out to be more promising and terrifying. Hell of a bumpy ride , with lots of nail bites and hands behind the face. Definitely needs a sneak peek at it but with a crucifix.<br/><br/>In The Conjuring there is comic relief brilliantly placed throughout to bring you down from your own climax so to get another chance to rebuild the fear and startle with it again. Wan understands the psychology behind tension and builds suspense through mere scene construction."
"MarumeChiisa","7","0","1","19 August 2013"," A Bit Disappointed, but Still OK
","I honestly expected much from James Wan, who had brought us 'Insidious' and 'Saw'. But I can't honestly say I was impressed when I watched this film.<br/><br/>The film was OK, I admit, and would be better if you haven't watch 'Insidious', or 'Haunting in Connecticut', or 'Woman in Black' and such. Because, I must say, In term of plot, those three are better than this one. 'The Conjuring' has some plot holes and unnecessary events that will only throw the audience's concentration. Not to mention its lacks of surprise element and eerie atmosphere. I just can't stop comparing this movie with its predecessors.<br/><br/>Let me elaborate some things that bothered me. Some 'unnecessary' events I mentioned above are the vision of Lorraine's daughter in the water, the presence of Annabelle the doll, any events that happened in the Warren's house were also has nothing to do with the main plot. And again, compared to 'Insidious' and such, the appearance of the main star of the film (ghost) weren't too scary and frightening. If it was intended for family movie (PG-13), then, it serves its purposes. But, if it was rated R, I'm not sure which part of this film deserves that rating.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good film. And if you have watched either 'Insidious', 'Haunting in Connecticut', or 'Woman in Black', I suggest not to put your expectation too high. It's just as good as those ones, if not worst. I'm sure the disappointment only came from those who had put high expectation like me."

"bencoulterno1","7","0","2","18 August 2013"," James Wan's new horror 'The Conjuring' is a fabulous homage to all the great paranormal and occult horrors that have gone before it.
","Granted, The Conjuring doesn't bring anything radically new or inspiring to the genre, but Wan's style, pace and cinematography definitely keep you on the edge of your seat throughout, and collective gasps from fellow cinema goers, plentiful. I especially enjoyed techniques employed by Wan, such as is used when the team first enter demon HQ (the basement) and our view switches to one of their own 70's styled cameras, being used to record 'the evidence'. Again, nothing new, but expertly delivered by Wan none the less, and helping greatly towards the rising tension of the scene. In-fact, the entire wardrobe and setting of the movie gives a masterful feel of the 70's era depicted.<br/><br/>For me the film got a lot more engrossing as it approached its mid- point, when its two sets of main characters first meet. This being the Perron family who are living in the old country haunted house and the victims of the demon, and the demonoloigst couple Ed and Lorraine Warren who have come to their aid. Again, I've seen this set-up before, but, it's a set-up that works and one I quite enjoy seeing. The films does however,despite the mid-point pick up, manage to keep the pace going from beginning to end with a bucket load of jump out of your seat moments, some of which really did make me jump up and almost out of my seat. Vera Farmiga, who plays Lorraine Warren, really can display some intense facial expressions you would want, and expect, from a haunted psychic being scared the living sh#t out of.<br/><br/>When I use the word homage, in my sub-title above, I'm referring to the staples of any of the great paranormal movies that are used in The Conjuring; rancid smells, bumps in the night, demons, possession, out of control birds and evil looking girls with long, greasy black hair. One such staple that was explored with slightly more depth in The Conjuring, and that I particularly enjoyed the familiar presence of, was the power of three; sinister events that tend to unfold, at least in the beginning, at around 3am, the demon always knocks three times on a door or wall, etc.. Patrick Wilson's character, based on true life demonologist Ed Warren, offers an insightful reason behind all of this, in that the Satanic demon/witch they are dealing with, likes to mock The Holy Trinity with the number three, bringing us firmly into the world of the Catholic Church at this point, I'm guessing to appeal to the majority audience in the US. The Catholic church is integral to parts of The Conjuring's storyline with its talk of Baptism, to protect the children, and exorcism's, condoned by The Vatican itself, leading me to daydream about how effective the story would have been with Imam's and Islam or Rabbi's and Judaism, that was until the next heart racing scene begun and grabbed my attention right back to the screen for some more seat jumping. <br/><br/>The movie is kind of predictable, never revealing anything you won't expect to happen or haven't seen before, but, does have an edge over its predecessors with its (wild) claims of being a true story. I was tapping away at my smart-phone as soon as I left the cinema, hounding Google for answers as to just how true it all was. I couldn't, surprisingly or not, find too much information online as to how true The Conjuring tale 'really was', even going as far as searching YouTube for the real footage the team of ghost hunters were apparently recording throughout the initial investigations. There were a few interesting documentaries and interviews with Ed and Lorraine Warren, however, which are well worth checking out if you see the movie.<br/><br/>This scene where the couple of good looking ghost hunters teach a class about the levels of spiritual possession, caused my mind to wonder into the reality of demonic possession and the reality of horrible diseases such as schizophrenia. I for one would love to see the 'real' real life movie dealing with the Perron Family's mental health problems, without the gore and special effects, but then doubt it would be anywhere near as entertaining and thrilling as The Conjuring."

Well you can only find out for yourself, and to me, this movie was pretty scary. It was well acted as well. I'll probably watch it again when it comes out on blue-ray.

"BoAvrilrock","9","0","2","16 August 2013"," A Thrill Ride for Haunting Lovers
","Being a fervent fan of the haunting genre of horror, The Conjuring was catapulted to my watchlist after I watched its trailer and saw that the directing was by James Wan - THE master behind one of my favourite horror films, Insidious (2011).<br/><br/>As per expectation, The Conjuring was nothing short of fun and thrill even for the seasoned horror fan like myself. Although the plot and scares were fairly predictable in my opinion, the team was able to aptly create that nervous tension as the audience braces itself for the scares. This, is a skill that distinguishes the good haunting film from the bad - whether the audience actually bursts a blood vessel waiting in fear for the terror which they know is lurking just around the corner. Definitely a thrill ride!<br/><br/>Some comfort for the weak-hearted though, is that there are many other good aspects of the film apart from the typical scares you find in the haunting genre - great acting from the (good-looking) cast, awesome picture and film set. Oh. I should warn you guys that the visual at some parts can be terrifying. Well...kudos to the makeup team! Was pretty impressed since I haven't really seen such demonic expressions since The Exorcist (1973) or the recent remake of the Evil Dead (2013). As a Christian, such diabolical portrayals give me the most goosebumps compared to sci-fi monsters or psychotic serial killers.<br/><br/>The reason why I rated The Conjuring slightly less than perfect is pretty much the predictability of the entire story line, and how many parts drew similarity to preceding films of this genre. So, it was really nothing new at all - satanic witches, haunted closet + cellar + music box, anti-Christ demons, gifted paranormal investigators, exorcism, and the usual stuff you get from the typical haunting film. At the end of all that fun, I'm not certain if I can pick out anything that's really unique to The Conjuring.<br/><br/>NONETHELESS, a 9/10 rating from me still indicates a worthy watch for all thrill-seekers and horror fanatics. I'm in for more fun if a sequel is ever confirmed! <br/><br/>P.S. Freakin' hell, Annabelle the doll is real! That doll's a b*tch."
"whattf","6","0","2","16 August 2013"," Little film packing a pretty good ""boom"". But.....
","All the ""horror scenes"" are the basic dark silent settings followed by a loud boom or bright clash. So, this film without a soundtrack is by in large toothless. Nevertheless the accompanying images are cool and creepy. The performances are solid and workman like. And ultimately not memorable. Now as far as the ""paranormal activity"" is concerned. BALONEY. This story appears to be something someone wants everyone to believe. The family was no doubt terrorized by a criminally insane and or a violent schizophrenic. The mother... or perhaps the father? Sorry, not by troubled spirits from the 17th or 18th century. On the business side of this film, who can't love the fact that a project this small has such impact. Even marketed nicely. ""The True Story of Ed and Lorraine Warren"". Interesting play on words since the events occurred to the Perron family. Remember that the story is based on a recounting of events that happened to someone else...you take it from there."
"dilip_tuli_20","10","0","2","16 August 2013"," A good old fashion horror movie
","When i went in to the theater to watch The Conjuring i had a preconceived notion of what i'm about to get into, but lets just say i was proved wrong. The first half of the movie is a story build up so there aren't many scares, the real treat is the second half specially the last half and hour that keeps you on the edge of the seat. James Wan let's you know and enjoy the first half letting you know the characters only to put us through some chilly and horrific moments later. The Conjuring relies on atmosphere rather than gore to serve the very simple ambition of scaring the hell out of the viewers. This is a horror film where a pair of suddenly clapping hands gives you the scares and i know it may sound childish but it does work. By the end of the movie you are left with some properly shaped nails due to the dramatic silences and sudden scares that are frighteningly impressive. If You are a big fan of blood and gore then this is not for you but if you are looking for some good old fashion suspense and horror then this one is a definite watch."
"lukeh23","6","0","2","15 August 2013"," A good horror, but not as great as some are making it out
","I read the reviews before watching the film, so I went into the viewing with higher the normal expectations.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a good horror, (we don't see many as of late), but I would in no way claim its a classic like some are on IMDb.<br/><br/>It relies on pretty much the same standard shots and audio effects as has been the trend over the past ten years. There are lots of 'what's behind you moments' which is when the demonic lady pops up, or is seen quietly brooding in a door way reflected in a mirror (either that or hiding in a wardrobe). And yes, you guessed, scary demon lady is of course wearing an old white nightgown.<br/><br/>It even has the stereo typical ending where all is well and good again in the world, until a closing shot shows a remnant of the demon is still present as a placeholder the for next movie.<br/><br/>So to those claiming this is the most scary film for the past 10 years, all I can say is you can't watch much horror. I personally would say 'Sinister' was much more scary then this. While watching Sinister I had to actually pause for a couple of minutes, as the tension was to much to handle.<br/><br/>Worth a watch, and its heads higher then a lot of the poor horror put out nowadays, but its really not as great as a lot of reviewers are making it out to be."
"goodellaa","8","0","2","15 August 2013"," Well-crafted, scary fun.
","I seldom give movies an 8, but this one is quite good. Not caring much if it is inspired by alleged true impressions of events, or whatever. Basically a story of supernatural horrors trying to kill people, to put it mildly, and how they reach out for help. Will everybody get killed? Kind of looks like it in the super scary first half. Then they tone it down into more of an adventure. Seems a little well lit at times, but when the darkness comes it acts like a character, and of course it is out to get them. Many skilled artists did great work on this picture. The soundtrack could be used in your Halloween yard haunt 'cause it is real creepy. Be advised that the supernatural horror likes to attack children. Enjoy."

"bluesman-20","10","0","2","15 August 2013"," Eerie and creepy.
","The Conjuring is based on a actual case from the files of Ed and Lorraine Warren. I have read enough accounts of the Warrens to give them credibility. And I've read into this case which took place over ten years. The movie compresses it into one year span 1971 to simplify things. Which is great in terms of telling the story. In 1971 the Perron family after several incidents in a city which shook them to the core those incidents were violent and scary enough for them to move to the country. they found a farm house which was perfect for their needs. Large enough for the large family a peaceful river running in the backyard and peace and relaxation. However the Farm House was abandoned and sold at a auction. When they bought it they didn't know it had a violent history. When they find a boarded up cellar filled with junk. An old piano and other broken pieces of furniture. It seems that when they uncovered the cellar one of the more evil spirits was allowed to roam the house again. And it hates the living. After several horrifying events. that has placed the family in danger they seek out help. Enter the Warrens, Ed and Lorraine Warren are professional Ghost hunters who work with the church to banish evil entities. When The Warrens go to the Perron's home they find a evil that is ancient and terrible. And Horrible in it's wrath. They stay to help the family fight the demon. Only to place themselves and their family in danger.<br/><br/>Hollywood takes liberties with the actual story but in this case it can be forgiven. After all they compressed a ten year case into a two hour film. And kept all of the scares intact. and made a credible and compelling film."

","One of the best horror movies I've seen in recent times, this one has all the elements to make it a cult classic.<br/><br/>Synopsis: A family terrorized by a supernatural entity asks a famous demonologist couple for help. On further inspection, the couple finds that the trouble is bigger than they initially imagined.<br/><br/>What sets this movie apart from similar movies in the recent past is its direction and execution. While most horror movies today focus on CGIs, and gore that tests one's limits, this one focused on building the mood and keeping the tension. Never have I seen a simple thing such a clap, scare the hell out of me. With Perfect timing, even the simplest of things can instill fear and tension. <br/><br/>I've seen few of James Wan's works in the past. Leaving Death Sentence (not bad, but not good either), almost all the movies were exceptionally good. After Dead Silence, Wan struck all the right notes with Insidious. And he takes it up a notch with The Conjuring. You can think of Conjuring as Insidious minus all the CGI. <br/><br/>I've heard several negative reviews that the plot and setting were very clichéd. Well, I'd like these persons to make a movie about a haunted house that is NOT clichéd. These things are bound to be repetitive. The real magic lies in the execution. From the director to child actors, everyone have done an awesome job. The child actors in particular were awesome.<br/><br/>If you are planning to watch the movie, understand that the movie is not meant for cheap thrills or creep show. Instead, it creates a dark mood against a vintage setting with plenty to relish."
"quincytheodore","8","0","1","14 August 2013"," Effectively frightening in ancient ambiance
","In the spirit of classic horror flicks, The Conjuring is eerily breathtaking and possibly the scariest movie of the year. It plays with the atmosphere so well with lingering shots, clever lighting manipulation, wicked music and timely scare. Not much CG is involved as it practically uses simple tricks to its amazing potential, it's surprising how effective they can be. Screenplay are done so well, at many occasions it felt as if the theater is frozen at the sight of stunningly ominous scenes. The director, James Wan from Insidious, crafts the movie brilliantly to the point of making these entities and people who are abused by them seemingly real.<br/><br/>Story follows Warrens couple, acclaimed demonologists who attempt to help Perron family as they battle their demonic invaders. Roger and Carolyn Perron with their five children move into a rural home where they are constantly being abused by ghosts of the past. Warrens eventually volunteer to help the family despite their own plaguing problem. The premise is simple, but it is executed with excellence. Characters are interestingly engaging, especially the younger girls, they convey the terror pretty well and the way camera idles around them makes it even more unsettling.<br/><br/>There is little modern influence on the movie, everything looks very archaic, and it's not just limited in the retro setting, but the overall nuance feels much like traditional western horror. The terror works fantastically with whispering ambiance, the slight display of other rooms around the camera angle and how the shadows enchantingly move about. Cinematography looks intentionally old, although it flutters in such precision you'll be involuntarily captivated into searching that strange dark corner where something might just appear.<br/><br/>Its scare utilizes some jump scare as well, but it is not cheap. The director builds up tension masterfully just by tilting the camera or lingering a few more seconds for specific scene. The result is nothing less than a thrill, I found myself shivering in some instances. Soundtracks adds to the horror even more, its hauntingly and somewhat choir-like mumble or inexplicable screeching is immensely frightening, making crawling noises of something that lurks uninvited. Everything is choreographed meticulously without resorting to blood and gore, albeit there is little seeping here.<br/><br/>It's nice to see the old vibe of horror makes its return, James Wan is a talented director and his antique style is remarkably fresh. The main protagonist, Patrick Wilson, who is also involved in Insidious, is looking very comfortable in this genre. I'm excited to see the sequels in near future, but for now The Conjuring will chill your spine delightfully."

","This has to be the best horror I have seen in a very long time. A proper scary film that seriously scared me. I never expected to be so scared watching a film ever. I think because it was based on true events that I felt it very disturbing. <br/><br/>I have seen hundreds of horror films, some scarier than others, some ridiculously funny considering it was supposed to be scary, some gory and some giving you a good fright every now and then but this film was just completely different giving you a good scare when you least expected it. The story the film follows wasn't dragging either, it gave a good insight to what demonologists/mediums do and how they try to help people with their knowledge and skills in this families situation. <br/><br/>The film is great because there is no delay to the story of film, it pretty much gets right into the creepiness from the beginning of the film and the events of the families story pretty much happen right at the beginning of the film too. <br/><br/>Cant fault any of the actors!<br/><br/>I think if people have given up on the horror genre, then they should try giving this film some of their time.

With every horror film there has to be a set the scene and get the back story of the characters, the conjuring does exactly this without pulling the strings too far. The conjuring has to be one of very few horror films in which I couldn't wait too see the end credits role as it has you hiding in your seat throughout one problem I thought with this film was that it lacked visual scares of the demons which threatened the family and when there was a sight of the demons it was very brief but effective which is why i believe the conjuring worked!"

","Based on real life story of Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren,its a movie about a family shifting to a new house and the house being haunted - the same old cliché,but with enough details about it being real which made it a little more spooky to watch. Directed by James Wan,it has been well portrayed with good amount of scares and spooks and a little pinch of humor here and there.Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson played the parts well of the paranormal investigators but if you are a fan of ""AMERICAN HORROR STORY"" the TV series then you are guaranteed of a less of scare. You know a movie is scary when the person sitting near you starts to talk to another person about some baseless small talk as he is too scared to watch the movie,had the similar experience. If you love horror genre or even if you hate it,you should watch it as it has a good story and a logical answer to all the DEMONIC questions you had..the foul smell,the spooky toy,the doll,the old witch,the dead hanging body,the suicides and the possession..almost everything. DEFINITELY A GO FOR!!!"

There was some campiness in this movie (but I expect this from every horror movie) but it didn't detract from it at all.<br/><br/>The story was good and creepy, the acting was fairly believable.

"3xHCCH","8","0","1","12 August 2013"," Intense Malevolence!
","""The Conjuring"" had its sneak preview in local theaters today, opening with a lot of hype. I am happy to report that all the hype about this film being one of the scariest horror films in recent years is totally true. And that assessment comes from a horror film fan like myself.<br/><br/>This movie was set in 1971, when the Perron family composed of Roger, Carolyn and their five daughters, moved into a rundown country house in an isolated area in Rhode Island. Almost immediately, strange events begin to happen to them. The ghostly manifestations started benignly, with creaky opening doors to unexplained bruising. As days passed, the attacks become increasingly violent and physical.<br/><br/>Carolyn desperately sought the help of noted supernatural investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. What they discover in the Perron home is a dark spirit more hateful than anything they have encountered before. They need to work against time before deadly events that had previously occurred in the house could happen again. In this extraordinary case, the Warrens needed to resort to the most extreme measures they know in order to save the tormented family<br/><br/>Unlike other film boasting about being based on a true story, this one actually convinces you that the horrific events shown in it happened in real life. A lot of this was due to the very authentic production design bringing us back to the early 1970s. The musical choices were atmospherically apt and creepy.<br/><br/>There was also the topnotch acting from the cast, which is unusual for a horror movie. The expertise and compassion of Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who played the Warrens, felt very realistic. The chemistry between them is incredibly palpable. Ron Livingston, Lili Palmer and the five young actresses who play the Perron daughters all played well as the victimized family. I would not be surprised if Vera Farmiga and Lili Palmer pick up acting nominations for their performances.<br/><br/>Director James Wan throws every horror gimmick at us here but still makes everything felt remarkably fresh and original. There was some welcome humor to lighten some of the intense dread and tension that builds up within the film which will make you squirm in your seats. The deliberately slow pace felt interminably long in some eerie scenes which can definitely creep most people out. The editing of the film was very effective in this regard.<br/><br/>There were some questionable aspects though. The poster and even the pre-credits scene will make you expect something, but the rest of the movie was totally about something else. There was a subplot about Ed and Lorraine's daughter which was very well-executed with some of the film's scariest scenes, but this ultimately led nowhere, except maybe a possible sequel, which is something I would look forward to."

","Well, if you are going for a horror movie then you are obviously expecting supernatural things to happen on the screen. Get yourself ready for a wonderful ride to the horror world. I'd say you will get more from it than you expected. Wonderful camera-work and direction will make you feel the world of horror, possessions and exorcism. If you are a heart patient then its not for you. There are stunts which are not commonly used in typical horror films. Perfect acting of the actors gave the movie a sweet touch of perfection. Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson were both as good as expected in the movie. I'd say James Wan has again done his job after Insidious. <br/><br/>so, get ready and buy the tickets fast, I assure you wont be disappointed if you are a true horror-worm !!"
"JoshuaHarryMurphy","7","0","1","12 August 2013"," The Conjuring
","James Wan's penultimate film before leaving his horror roots to direct Fast and Furious 7, The Conjuring (notably based from a true story) is a take on a typical ghost story that manages to be both unnervingly familiar and yet surprising and ultimately satisfying. <br/><br/>The plot surrounds two 'Ghostbusters' Ed and Lorraine Warren who are requested to investigate the Perron family's new home in which various supernatural activity has been taking place. The film echoes many aspects from similarly themed films; a dog that will not enter the house, noises from under beds, birds that slam into the exterior of the house (something that we saw only months ago in the vastly inferior 'Dark Skies'). This bird-suicide sequence feels oddly out of place, perhaps due to the unconvincing CGI that depletes the sense of genuine fear throughout the characters. <br/><br/>However; Wan's influence manages to combine the remaining aspects to keep the film from feeling anything but stale. Played completely straight, the film feels like a classic horror flick, which undoubtedly can be partly down to the excellent performances from the cast, especially from Patrick Wilson as Ed. The production design of the house is as effective as the performances inside of it, contributing to some of the most terrifying and intense moments of the film, including a figure immersed in darkness looming behind a door, and a game of 'hide- clap-and-seek'. <br/><br/>John R. Leonetti's cinematography is again excellent, especially within the prologue and climax of the film which enhance the film's beauty while revelling in its ugliness. Had it not been for the sequel to Insidious in the pipeline, James Wan would have left the horror genre with an immensely haunting piece of work. <br/><br/>Verdict: 4/5"
"phd_travel","10","0","1","12 August 2013"," Scary and superb - horror is on the right path again!
","How wonderful it is to have a real classy haunted house horror movie again. Recently there have been lots of gory slasher films but not many effective ghost and possession movies. 'Haunting in Connecticut' wasn't great. <br/><br/>In the Conjuring you get a lot - creepy dolls, a very haunted house, demonic possession, paranormal investigation etc. This movie is wonderfully nostalgic in the best way - the setting and straightforward story without the overuse of modern effects. But it doesn't feel dated.<br/><br/>This is based on a real life haunting during the 70s in a rural house in Rhode Island. The creepy history involves witches. Ed & Lorraine Warren investigate and help the young family the Perrons which includes 5 young daughters. There are so many vulnerable people there it keeps you constantly on edge. Liked the house and setting of the movie - historic looking but not obviously creepy. The screenplay is effective at making it feel like a true story. It allows for you to get a feel for the people involved. <br/><br/>The cast is well chosen. Playing the Warrens, Patrick Wilson and the lovely Vera Farmiga look so right in their 70s get up. She has a sympathetic face for this kind of role. As Mr Perron Ron Livingston looks suitably baffled and worried. His wife is played by Lili Taylor is a talented actress who should be in movies more often. The kids are good too especially Joey King of 'Romona and Beezus' who is convincing at looking scared.<br/><br/>The directing by James Wan is well paced and effective showing you all you want to see - providing real scream out loud scares. He doesn't use unnecessary shock tactics or film too much in the dark. The scares are saved for the most effective parts of the story. For fans of Wan you get much more than in 'Insidious'.<br/><br/>Heed the R rating it's frightening enough to play on the mind after the movie is over like the original 'Amityville Horror'. Although kids are in the show it is way too frightening for kids to watch.<br/><br/>Let's hope this movie sets the right path for horror movies again. After all there are so many 'based on a true story' hauntings to adapt. Can't wait for the sequel."

","I watched the full movie here: http://Theater15.com (for those who wanna watch it online free) Anyway, regarding the movie, it is pretty awesome, great cinematography, but I hope they do realize that the plot should have been better and had a better ending... but overall, its pretty good movie!xxx THE CONJURING This is not ""Saw"", ""Friday, the 13th"" or other slasher fare. Instead, think ""Amityville Horror"" meets ""The Exorcist"". Director James Wan takes you to your seat's edge early on and keeps you there in this retro-thriller.<br/><br/>Scary? Absolutely! but the characters are well-developed and the principal actors (Patrick Wilson, Vera Farmiga, Ron Livingston, and Lili Taylor) are all terrific. Did I mention it was scary? I think it's time to watch a double-feature of ""Hairspray"" and ""Grease"""
"dogndogs","7","0","1","11 August 2013"," A fine horror
","A textbook haunting horror movie done fine.<br/><br/>Nothing original about this film at all. You have children, ghostly children, ghostly women, exorcisms with creepy voices, periods of silence and then a loud bang; you know the drill. However, each of these elements were executed pretty well. I'm sure everyone in the cinema expected every part of the scares, but yet they still jumped. Credit to the actors and director.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent horror; but honestly, nothing to go shouting off roof tops about. At the time of me writing this, it is rated at 7.8 , which is too high imo. It should be around the 7.0 mark.<br/><br/>I do have one complaint. The posters, made me believe that this film was based around the haunted doll. In fact, the doll had very little or almost nothing to do with the main plot. I felt a bit cheated on that regards. <br/><br/>Anyways, go watch the Conjuring if you have free time and fancy a horror movie at the moment. If you don't, just re-watch any haunting movie you really enjoyed, and it would probably do the same job."
"ChrisM75633","10","0","1","11 August 2013"," Quality horror movie with lots of scares and a great storyline
","NOTE: No spoilers except for in the second paragraph and it's kind of a minor one<br/><br/>The worst thing about most horror films the last few years is the lack of story and character development, while they instead focus on making you jump (mostly failing) and making you puke with so much gore (this works most of the time). The Conjuring was different in that it had an actual story that you cared about and the characters made you care more about them than whatever supernatural beings were in the house or whatever.<br/><br/>They didn't really explain the ghosts/demons/antagonists all that well, but I'm glad because it focused on the characters more and we knew all we needed of the supernatural beings. I loved that they had the house just be so completely haunted, instead of it just being one spirit, it was literally like 10. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of horror films so when I watch one, I usually know what to expect but this movie exceeded all of my expectations. The main thing I look for is what sets one horror movie apart from the others, most of them that are different and good usually aren't all that scary which most people don't like. This one was scary almost the whole way through, parts of it really made me jump. They didn't do anything all that different from other horror movies, but they did it all much better and more thought out. <br/><br/>Definitely a movie I'd recommend."

"YJLcool","8","0","1","11 August 2013"," A successful terrifying yet engaging horror thriller
","The Conjuring is an impressively terrifying (hate to say this) yet engaging and heartfelt horror thriller, inspired by the hauntings of Perron family case faced by real paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren in the 1970s. Despite the fact that it's frightening to watch, one can't help but to feel impressed with the film at the same time. While the film offers nothing new to the genre (most of the elements presented in the film were done before...dolls, bed pulling, sleepwalking, animals dying in a weird way,etc), but the pacing and execution was brilliant.<br/><br/>The acting main casts were excellent in delivering their best performance, especially Farmiga, her facial expressions is so convincing that you believe there's real evil lurking in that place. In addition, the lectures, investigations done by the Warrens in the film somehow managed to slowly build up the tension and convince many to believe that this story is rooted in reality. The film takes time to develop the characters and gives as much screen time as it possibly can to the daughters, so the audience can be involved with the family as the story progresses. Throughout the film, you're not just fear for the impending danger and doom that the Perrons will experience soon, but for the safety of the Warrens as well.<br/><br/>Overall, James Wan successfully mixed the best elements of haunted house and demonic possession concepts into one film and cleverly delivered them in a seemingly refreshing way to the audience. If you're not afraid of being scared out of your life and would like a decent challenge, be my guest and go watch it now."

You ask how would I know with my eyes covered?

"Christian_Dimartino","9","0","2","10 August 2013"," Though it's been done to death, it's done too well.
","The majority of the reviews for The Conjuring are calling it one of the scariest movies ever. Now, after many weeks, I have finally seen it, and I must jump into the conversation. I think people tend to get ""scary"" and ""creepy"" confused. My definition of ""Scary"" is when a movie makes you jump, a lot, while at the same time, causing nightmares. ""Creepy"" is when a movie stays with you, and sends chills up your spine. The Conjuring will make you jump, guaranteed, but it is more successful at creeping the hell out of you.<br/><br/>The Conjuring, which is directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious), is one of the most effective scary movie since, well, Insidious. I'm sure glad that Wan didn't continue with the Saw series. The Conjuring is a well made, good old fashioned haunted house movie that doesn't use blood and guts (thank God!), and it actually better than any movie of its kind since... I don't remember.<br/><br/>The film tells the true story of the Perron family (the parents played by Ron Livingston and Lilly Taylor) who move into a house, and guess what? They got scary business going on. So, they seek the help of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, who are dynamite as always), a married who are paranormal investigators.<br/><br/>Well, it's obvious that if actors as good as these are in a movie like this, it isn't bad. And it's far from it. This is Wan's best work yet, and I found Insidious compellingly creepy. What works best about this one is the way it all comes together. It doesn't just jump into the terror. The movie delivers its terror slowly.<br/><br/>I was entertained by nearly every second of it. This is one of those rare ""Based on a true story"" scary movies that works. It's a movie that will leave you talking and thinking about it long after its over. It's a movie that is R-rated for its scares alone. When that happens (and keep in mind this is from the guy that did Saw), then it's obviously good. I never thought that a movie done to death could ever be done this well again. This is a great story that needed to be told, and I'm glad it was.<br/><br/>A-"
"adj-699-887746","8","0","2","10 August 2013"," Perhaps the best Horror Film of the decade
","I was a little doubtful at first--I was so-so impressed with a few recent horror films that attempted to bring the unbelievable into everyday reality with camera-shake and cheap lens filters, and didn't expect much more from this film. However, I was curious to see what James Wan (Saw, Insidious, Dead Silence) was up to here.<br/><br/>Set in the seventies, the main characters are believable and serious right from the start. Some bad, dark things happen in this world and Ed and Lorraine Warren are among those who work to keep such things at bay and out of the daylight. They go about their profession in a matter-of-fact way--you can plainly see their stoic acceptance of a rather frightening reality--and they appear almost battle-worn right from the beginning and do so with a convincing depth. Vera Farmiga just has that 'believable face'--her moments here are engrossing and was obviously an excellent casting choice for her role.<br/><br/>I was reminded of the chilling scene in the Exorcist that revealed, not only the Vatican's real-life belief and acknowledgment of demonic possession, but in the elaborate rituals that are part of the church's practice today, lending a level of credibility to the girl's possession by a really nasty, hateful demon, and thus a real chilling feel to the film.<br/><br/>Lili Taylor also adds that 'everyday mom' persona and does so with her usual depth, again making the events here seem more real. Her acting in 'The Haunting' essentially stole the show, and she doesn't disappoint here either and, again, was a great casting choice.<br/><br/>Supporting cast are all above par and Wan seems to get the most out of each and every one.<br/><br/>Apart from one or two minuscule blips in the SFX--like a body flung through the air just a wee bit too slowly on the wire--everything seemed to gel quite well and was isometrically believable.<br/><br/>I know I am enjoying a film when I start sucking on the lemon slice at the bottom of my jumbo ice-tea.<br/><br/>If you enjoy the genre and like the more intellectually satisfying and less blood & gore type of film, this one's for you.<br/><br/>I give it an ""8"" because no one has ever made a ""10"" yet and a ""9"" is likely impossible since Kubric passed away (though we Live in Hope).<br/><br/>."

"Kieran78991-760-354330","7","0","1","10 August 2013"," This is not a classic. But its good.
","Let's face it – Making a horror film in 2013 is not an easy task – Horror fans are not easy to please, thus any new major horror release is condemned to be compared to the classics. Any slasher film that comes out gets compared to 'Halloween' (1974), Any new monster film gets compared to 'Godzilla' (1954), And along with 'The Conjuring', any new paranormal film gets deemed a poor attempt at making a new Exorcist or Shining. Its cruel, but forgivable. The philosophy behind it Is why should we settle for less than we already have. But every so often a film does come along that sets the horror community alight in a good way –Saw did it in 2004, Paranormal Activity did it in 2007, Let the right one in did it in 2008, and now in 2013, James Wan's latest horror outing has done it. When Wan brought out Insidious in 2011, it had to compete against the likes of Source code and Hop, neither one of them being particularity major contenders, and yet it only managed to make a little over $13 000 000 on its April opening weekend, going on to make just a few million shy of the $100 000 000 mark worldwide. The conjuring was originally slated for an early 2013 release, but after an unprecedented, acclaimed reception with test audiences, WB made the bold decision to move the release date back, into Q3,which in recent years has become a hotbed for superhero blockbusters and animated juggernauts; This was among the first horror films to be released in this month since The Omen in 2006. But it paid off, having the biggest opening for an original R-rated horror film ever – An R-rating, not because of profanity of sex, but because the MPAA felt it to be ""too scary"" - Grossing over $41 million over its opening weekend and only dropping 47% over its second weekend, which for a horror film is ridiculously impressive. So what is it about this film that makes it so different to the numerous paranormal activity sequels, last years The possession, Del Toro's MAMA from earlier this year or even Wan's own Insidious? Well, nothing really. After all the hype over this film, I was expecting well-rounded characters, an innovative approach to the ever-increasing banality of the possession formula and a shocking ending – instead I was subjected to one-dimensional cut-outs of actual real life people, and nothing of much shock or surprise. Quite frankly I was disappointed. I only found myself marginally creeped out at two points, both which took place in the basement, and I only found myself jumping once, again, during the basement scene. The acting was brilliant, especially by the young girls, but the dialogue they had to contend with was nothing shy of weak. The music was affective but had nothing much to affect. It was only the camera work of Wan and his collaborative cinematographer John R. Leonetti (Dead Silence, Child's Play 3, Indiseous) which gave the film any stand-alone quality from the sun-genre that it so carefully played into. The consistent fluidity of the camera, mounted on a trolley and/or crane at all times was unsettling and did create heightened intensity, only to be undone by a lack of happenings on the screen. To any one who has seen this and is currently labelling me as unpleasable, i would just like to say that this is the best horror film of the year so far, but its not an instant classic. Ghosts that latch onto the kids, paranormal investigators with a shady and conflicted past, a dog that refuses to go into the house, a member of local law enforcement getting involved, an exorcism that looks only angers the evil spirit, come on! Its been done to death! The only refreshing points of this film was the lack of sex and lack of death, but that and that alone is not enough to make an ""instant classic"" as so many people are calling it. It is still in thousands of cinemas worldwide, has currently grossed over $140 000 000 and has already been commissioned for a sequel. Yawn. I just hope James Wan doesn't direct it. Having been involved with two of the Saw sequels, having just made Indiseous 2, sitting in the directors chair for Fast 7, if he returns for this sequel as well, it could spell the end for a once promising innovative career that never really got going. 6.5/10..."

They call in married paranormal investigators Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson).<br/><br/>This is an old fashion haunted house scary story. This is no big twist or slasher porn. This is a rather straight forward ghost story. It hearkens back to films like Amityville or Poltergeist. All the actors are spot on. The tension builds nicely throughout the movie. My only complaint is that the ending is slightly too hectic and runs on a little but that's a very minor point. It's barely worth a mention really. It's great to have an old fashion horror done well."

The Conjuring gives a brilliant performance on the merit of its actors, musical score (which wasn't bad), and landscaping.<br/><br/>The movie reminds me a little of Amityville Horror in days of old. We have a nice family moving into a house where atrocities occurred in the past. Soon the demonic spirit(s) starts taking over. Suspense, thriller, heart palpitations for what's to come are all the signs of a good horror.<br/><br/>Wan has done well again.

"dinosaur-darrell","8","0","2","9 August 2013"," The peak of the supernatural genre
","Over the past few years there has been a boom of mediocre horror/supernatural films. But move over Paranormal Activity because The Conjuring is how this should be done. I have always been a fan of James Wan, since Saw when my jaw hit the floor I knew that he was something special, so as soon as The Conjuring began to see light I was immediately excited to see what Wan would have up he's sleeve for us next and he did not disappoint. Coming out of the cinema my palms were sweaty and my back aching from tensing up so much. What this film does right is it allows you to get into the story while not holding back on scaring you from the word go. They also don't dawdle on what this could be, its very quickly established that this is something evil that wants to harm them which is something that annoys me in this genre that half the film is a door slamming or someone being scared by a cat coming out of the wardrobe. I watch quite a few horror films but this was the first in years that actually 'scared' me. It feels familiar yet you don't know whats coming round the corner. I genuinely jumped out of my seat a few times out of not being able to read when the scare was coming. I'll end this by saying don't watch the trailers because they give away a lot, but I can honestly say you can walk into the cinema with high expectations of this film and you won't be disappointed. Can't wait for a DVD release to relive the experience again."

","Although the majority of modern horror films with the ""based on true events"" tag-line tend to be fairly disappointing The Conjuring is a departure from the norm and a return to the classic era with all of the modern benefits such as better effects, make-up etc. This film has an amazing and in depth story with amazing acting performances to back it up. With classic aspects such as the mise-en-scene, music and general style which put classic films like The Exorcist and The Haunting in mind, as well as more modern aspects such as SFX, practical effects and camera capabilities, this film is a genuine gem and should be rated as high as some of the great horror films of the 21st century e.g. The Ring, The Saw Series and Mirrors and is a must watch for veteran horror fans as well as newcomers to the horror genre."
"kajalrahul","9","0","2","9 August 2013"," The movie is truly horror
","It is one of the best horror movies I ever watch. They were saying it is based on the real story. Now I am thinking about those who have lived this movie. Scary! Very Scary! If someone looks for intense fear in the movies . Watch it! I have seen lots of horror movies where I ended up laughing during the show. But, while I was watching this, I was sitting with folded legs on the chair. If you are planning to watch this with your girlfriend. Nice choice. Because you are going to get tight hugs on every scene. Truly, it is worth watching for those who likes horror movies. Length of the movie was proper because if it had not finished, I would have run out of the theatre."
"debanjanmk","9","0","2","9 August 2013"," Scare at its best
","The problem with most modern horror films is that they've stopped trying to scare you; they want to gross you out instead with elaborate and explicit torture and killings.The Conjuring gives an adrenaline rush to your body with few scary scenes and spooky moments.It is Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are the soul of the film especially Farmiga. She is fill of expression and gives in a great performance as Lorraine.It's the subtle and steady build-up of suspense and psychological tension, coupled with sudden spine-chilling scares and dramatic silences that make you go numb with fear.Much to our satisfaction, filmmaker James Wan's (Saw, Insidious) direction defies the done-to-death horror movie clichés that have so far caused most people to disregard the genre."
"joben-525-633946","7","0","2","9 August 2013"," 'Horrifying?', 'Blood Curdling?' No...but its pretty damn good exercise
","James Wan is a very impressive director in this genre of film and although his previous work 'Insidious' divided opinion, I found it particularly scary and atmospheric. <br/><br/>'The Conjuring' certainly feels like it has been made in the mould of Wan. He has left a clear imprint there from the way he conjures up those chilling moments almost with ease and it appears he has quite literally terrified some audiences across the globe. However, for me - it didn't quite live up to its billing.<br/><br/>Critics and audience members who had viewed the piece labelled it with all kinds of superlatives. Perhaps it was foolish of me to have read comments beforehand but I was expecting something so incredibly scary it would send a blood curdling shiver down my spine. It certainly didn't do that though if I chose to ignore all those acclaimed reviews it received prior to may viewing, I would tell you it was certainly an exercise in fear. Some sections of 'The Conjuring' were intensely eerie however I wouldn't say it thundered down any barriers.<br/><br/>A little unsettling also is the fact that Wan loosely based this piece on a true discovery by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. And on that note it gives me great pleasure to say that actors Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga were truly outstanding in their performances as the married couple. <br/><br/>Another special mention should be awarded to Lili Taylor who took on the complex role of Carolyn Perron. Truly excellent in the films majority as the concerned mother before superbly adapting to her disturbing performance in the films latter stages.<br/><br/>One tip before watching the film would be to know as little as possible about the premise and NOT to watch previews or trailers of it knowingly. One of the best suspense scenes in the films entirety is more or less shown from start to finish in one official trailer. <br/><br/>'The Conjuring' is a highly recommended horror. While it doesn't hit the nail on the head with every attempted 'scare' it certainly ranks up their as far as films in the genre are concerned. <br/><br/>A tad overrated but still rather chilling and undeniably scary."
"dp-brightful","6","0","2","9 August 2013"," BORING for first hour, EXCELLENT for the last 45 minutes
","I have absolutely no idea why this film has the rating it has. The first hour is SLOW, BORING and completely PLAYED OUT. No need to give anything away. Just rest assured that you will yawn for the first hour waiting for the film to actually take off. Nothing original at all and way too slow.<br/><br/>Then the film takes off, and when it does you will be happy you gave it a chance to develop. The last 45-50 minutes make the entire film worth watching. It is like an old-school horror movie that sucks you in and delivers genuinely scary moments. Excellently done last half of the film.<br/><br/>When taken in total, this film is only a 6 because of the way it starts. Had they done something even remotely interesting or unique with the first half then perhaps it would have been better. Unfortunately, the film is 20-25 minutes too long with totally boring content that reduces this films to a 6."
"Nibbler007","9","0","2","9 August 2013"," Mr. Wan did it again!!
","Now we have to admit that James Wan has created a style of his own in order to do scary movies. It began with Saw, then Dead Silence, then Insidious. He evolved again in The Conjuring. <br/><br/>Saw it yesterday. Pop-corn chewing noises and coughs along the theater didn't happen at all throughout the second half of the movie. People were tense and scared as f**ck. I was, too.<br/><br/>Wan's way of filming is particularly disturbing. He pulls out tricks you rarely see in a director nowadays. He knows faces can be scary as hell. He knows about the primal fear we all have for the possessed puppets. Scary witches, powerful demons, chilling strange sounds, anacronic music, wicked kids. He displays so much on screen is hard to memorize those tricks, but one thing is shure: they work. <br/><br/>In The Conjuring, jumps and scares are rarely predictable. As a horror fan who saw lots of those movies I can't tell you how do I appreciate that. So you never know how you gonna be frightened out next time. That drives you crazy. You get so tense you forget to breathe. It's gripping and delightfully crafted. James Wan explores everything he can to twist a super known genre and manages to give it a fresh view.<br/><br/>And this time, the movie has an excellent crescendo (like Insidious) but flaws a little at the end. I think it could have been a little longer and explore a little more on the grand finale. I didn't buy so much the end of the movie. Bethsheba was a badass old witch. But I won't be so harsh on the ending: I jumped and scared and got what I wanted to see: Mr. Wan did it again (in that 70's style). <br/><br/>Cheers from Argentina."

If you have never seen such a film then this is likely to scare your socks off. If you have - and if you are in the audience then this is likely to be the case - then you will enjoy it, because it is a slickly paced piece of entertainment with a lot of scare value generated by anticipation but also a reasonable amount of ""payoff"" material. But it won't have anything in it which you haven't seen many times before.<br/><br/>The casting is good - Vera Farmiga (Lorraine Warren) is always very watchable, and Lily Palmer as Mom Carolyn Perron is good, as are several of the girls, the atmosphere is effective, and it isn't overly dependent on loud noises.<br/><br/>If you like this sort of movie then The Conjuring (where does that name come from, by the way?) is a good one."

","A family moves into a Rhode Island home to soon discover the home has a dark and evil past. They seek out the help of renowned paranormal researchers Ed and Lorraine Warren.<br/><br/>This is by far the best horror film in recent years and deserves to be recognized as so. The cinematography, special effects, plot, and the acting are excellent. The film starts out in a great pace and keeps going until the end. The plot and back story are very well written but above all the acting really steals the movie. The horror scenes have great build-ups and even though I knew they were coming it still left a creepy vibe behind. My favorite aspect of this film is that it was based on true events which makes things a bit creepier. The only flaw I found is that in some scenes there is serious lack of lighting. I'm not sure if this was done on purpose to add an element of horror but it didn't work for me. Overall this film gets an 8/10 from me. An absolute must for horror movie lovers."

"GenericBadGuy","10","0","2","8 August 2013"," Wan balances originality and nostalgia to create the scariest film in years
","First of I have to start by saying that The Conjuring is not just a masterclass of horror cinema but it cements James Wan as not just the best horror director this generation, not just as one of the best horror directors ever but, in my opinion, one of the best directors ever. This is shown with the very first shot of the film. I'm not going to tell you what the shot is of but believe me when I tell you that it really sets the tone and if this particular thing scares you, it shows you how scary The Conjuring is going to be.<br/><br/>While, in execution, The Conjuring is nothing new, a simply normal looking family move into a haunted house, the haunting begins with small things happening at first (in this it's all the clocks stopping at 3:07 AM) and escalates, they get people in to see what they can do and the apparition becomes increasingly violent and has to be removed. However where The Conjuring shines is with its scares. In many horror movies when there is a gap in the score, you know there is something scary going to happen but here it's not like that. At points when the score goes quiet Wan doesn't always throw something scary at you and when he does throw something scary at you there isn't always the sudden audio spike in the music rather he lets the horrifying look of the ghost scare you.<br/><br/>Another area where The Conjuring shines is with the performances. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are great as the paranormal investigating couple the Warrens and Lili Taylor as the mother who ends up getting possessed with some of the best possession acting I have seen since The Exorcism of Emily Rose. The children do great jobs as well which isn't uncommon in movies nowadays but it is still worth mentioning. <br/><br/>Overall, The Conjuring is the scariest horror film in years and with Insidious 2 coming out in September, James Wan is on track to a comfy seat in the horror directors walk of fame."

The story is based on true incidents and is powerful along with fantastic screenplay. I felt that there were some chilling moments in the film but not enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Couple of scenes will give you a jilt - The scenes where evil starts unraveling on the family , the moment Warrens enters the house and realizes the evil spirit latching on the family and finally the last exorcism scene has been filmed brilliantly. Cinematoography is good. Art direction is enduring. Editing is tight. It is Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga are the soul of the film especially Farmiga.

Only after the movie ended, I was able to realize how much psychological scares they give you here. I started imagining noises and movements around my room. I loved the acting.

I also have to say the acting was well done, and not many horror films these days have that. I give it 9/10 and not 10/10 because it lacks extreme originality. Yes it has some new stories. But it's still the classic story of a haunted house where a religious group comes to preform exorcisms and it doesn't go as planned. Overall, it's awesome. Is it scary? Yes. Especially the first 5 minutes of the film. Is it the scariest movie I've seen? No. But it's close and it's worth watching."

","The Conjuring is a movie about paranormal investigators, Ed(Patrick Wilson) & Lorraine Warren(Vera Farmiga) who have solved hundreds of cases concerning the supernatural. Their latest case involves married couple Roger(Ron Livingston) & Carolyn Perron(Lili Taylor) who, along with their five daughters, Andrea(Shanley Caswell), Nancy(Haley McFarland), Christine(Joey King), Cindy(Mackenzie Foy) & April(Kyla Deaver) think that the house they moved into, is haunted by a vicious demonic entity. <br/><br/>I have to admit that, the plot of the film is pretty clichéd. A family moving into a house in the middle of nowhere & the place turns out to be haunted, is a story that has been done to death in the horror genre. However, the way director James Wan has executed the plot is mind blowing! The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat. Some scenes in the film, scare the living hell out of you! What's even more spine chilling is that, this is a true story based on one of the many paranormal cases the Warrens solved. I liked the first half of the film better than the second half. While watching horror movies, I always like the suspense/mystery element better than, when everything becomes super crazy! Other than the plot, the film barely uses any of the other clichés like sudden noises & tons of blood & gore. Vera Farmiga's performance as Lorraine Warren is one of the highlights of the film. She really embodies the character. Patrick Wilson is great as Ed Warren. Ron Livingston is brilliant as Roger Perron. Lili Taylor is outstanding as Carolyn Perron. Shanley Caswell, Haley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy & Kyla Deaver are impressive as Andrea, Nancy, Christine, Cindy & April respectively. The Conjuring is a must watch, especially on the big screen. Good luck falling asleep at night!"

","Good horror movies are so rarely made these days .And I can say that The Conjuring is one of those rare movies.<br/><br/>This is not the scariest movie ever to be honest but it does provide the audience with some good scary jumps. I really like that director James Wan(Saw, Dead Silence) doesn't use CGI too much to create scary faces. The fact that he uses more prosthetic make up makes it look more real and terrifying. And this is coming from someone who very rarely gets frighten while watching horror movies. I was on the edge of my seat during the last 30 minutes of the movie .Tension is slowly build in this movie from the beginning throughout the entire movie from scene construction. <br/><br/>The first half of the movie is slow .Not a lot of thing happens in it but the second half of the movie is quiet chilling ,and this is where you get into the story completely. The storyline is not that original .It's about this family who moves into a haunted house and then paranormal researchers come to figure out the problem and fix it .Despite the 'common haunted house ,possessed by demon' storyline( sounds familiar?),the story is actually well developed throughout the course of the movie. <br/><br/>The characters of the movie could have been developed more. One of the flaws of this movie is the character Roger Perron. I feel like his character wasn't developed at all. He was just there to be there. Everyone's acting was good . Vera Farmiga's ,Lily Taylor's (specially during the second half)and Patrick Wilson's performance is worth mentioning. <br/><br/>The cinematography is good as well .The vintage 70's horror atmosphere was just a perfect model for it.<br/><br/>Overall I give this movie 7.5/10.It is definitely worth watching at least once. If you are a horror movie fan,you will most likely enjoy it."

The ending was disappointing as although its quite rare to have a nice ending- I was thinking a more imaginative ending.

","Well I am a movie fan but I admit that I don't see every one that comes out. I am 59 and I can truthfully say that this is one of the scariest movies that I ever saw. This was in the best tradition of scare movies, not slasher movies. I saw the Exorcist the first time around as well as Poltergeist. As far as I am concerned Poltergeist was a comedy compared to the Conjuring! Regarding the Exorcist, it did have a great story, but a true scary movie, not really sure. To me a true scary movie is a ride thru a Halloween cornfield or a fun house. Now all the interesting stuff in the Exorcist just took place in the child's room. True there was the director tossed down the outside stairs, but everything was shocking but not really unexpected. Scary means unexpected to me. Everything in Megan's room was heard about before, vomiting, head turning, levitation, etc. The other movies in the Conjuring class IMHO, would be the Haunting (original), Psycho and even the Stephen King mini-series Rose Red."

Yes, there are clichés but the way they are transcended across the screen made them new again...if you know what I mean. Also, so what...if it scares you or at the very least creeps you out then it works!. The opening ten minutes with Annabelle the doll are really creepy (there's a good link on the message boards) which sets the pace for the rest of the film. Good character building and the fact that this is allegedly based on truth gives it that extra kick.

"Hellmant","9","0","2","24 July 2013"," James Wan has now proved himself to be a master of the horror genre!
","'THE CONJURING': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Director James Wan (who first burst onto the movie scene with 2004's immensely popular 'torture porn' slasher film 'SAW') has now proved himself to be a master of the horror genre. He suffered a mild setback (and the sophomore jinx) with the film 'DEAD SILENCE' in 2007 but returned to good form with the revenge action film 'DEATH SENTENCE' that same year. He's now proved himself to be one of the masters of the horror genre with 2010's 'INSIDIOUS' and his newest offering 'THE CONJURING'. Both are the purest examples of what makes scary movies so powerful and a film lover's delight!<br/><br/>The film was written by Chad and Carey Hayes (who also co-scripted the horror films 'THE REAPING' and the 2005 'HOUSE OF WAX' remake) and it's loosely based on true events in the lives of Ed and Lorraine Warren (played by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga in the film, Wilson also starred in Wan's 'INSIDIOUS'). The Warrens were respected paranormal investigators in the 1970s and this film revolves around them helping the Perron family with a spooky disturbance in their home. The Perrons (Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) were a married couple who moved into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island, with their five daughters, in 1971. They were haunted by an unseen entity from the moment they moved into the house. The case was the most disturbing and frightening one of the Warrens' careers.<br/><br/>The film is a classic throwback to the great spook fests of the 1970s (like 'THE EXORCIST'). It uses minimal special effects and was made on a budget of just $13 million. It's highlighted by Wan's creative directing and an excellently freaky score by Joseph Bishara (who also did the music for 'INSIDIOUS' as well as a number of other recent horror films). The movie represents everything I love about horror films and why it's the most successful genre in cinema today (this film made $41 million in it's opening weekend; that's more than three times it's budget and the biggest opening ever for an R rated horror film). James Wan is one of the elite directors that helped pave the way.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFfGQiMGk-4"
"amesmonde","Null","0","1","6 August 2013"," When haunted house possession goes right
","A family move into an American country house haunted by its original owner. So after a paranormal investigative couple are called in to debunk the disturbances only to find they may have bitten off more than they can chew.<br/><br/>After a strong 1960s opening involving a creepy demonic doll it flashes-forward to the 70s with a family moving into their new house. From then on The Conjuring pretty much doesn't let up on the scares. While derivative, director James Wan wastes no time building on and defining what we've seen in other horrors but offering a complete package.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, writers Chad and Carey Hayes offer basements, pianos, priests, dolls and clocks. Their natural dialogue is well delivered by the cast, here the child actors are on form (arguably faultless) with Wan's regular Watchmen and Insidious actor Patrick Wilson delivering a good performance, his calibre adds to the proceedings. Vera Farmiga gives a subtle performance and gets the bulk of the character development. Their sub-plot sets this apart from other horrors of its kind. In addition, with some academic demonology information the lecture segments pay off once the couple being their investigation giving some scope to the proceedings. After the half hour mark the scares come thick and fast.<br/><br/>The 1970s is recreated perfectly, the camera work and lighting add to the ominous feel in conjunction with Joseph Bishara's score with its piano and horns that add to the creepier moments. As it develops every horror cliché is put on screen, dead animals, apparitions, mirrors, bruises, sleepwalking, recordings everything apart from the horror kitchen sink is thrown in. But Wan delivers the shocks and scares exceptionally as well as subtly leaving much to the viewers imagination.<br/><br/>With a debunking element from the Red Lights (2012), underrated Innkeepers (2011) and with moments reminiscent of The Exorcist (1973) The Amityville Horror and its remake, it shares much with these other films but still stands on its own. The Conjuring is debatably more grounded than Wan's other work probably due to the true story aspect. The special effects are outstanding and although the closing act is slightly overblown, it finishes on a fitting, tense and ominous low key moment..<br/><br/>It may not be as nerve-racking as the recent Sinister, but if you like haunted house and possession films this isn't one to miss."

","Yikes! It's rare for a film to rattle me at my very existence. The Conjuring (2013) does just that. It throws me off kilter much like the nightmare that causes my heart to splitter-spatter and forces my eyeballs wide-open in broad daylight. It takes me a minute to catch my breath. I realize the nightmare that scares me awake is the one in which I find myself impregnated with my ex-boyfriend's baby. To which I realize, it is what it is--a nightmare! It's horrifying because it's so vivid it's real.<br/><br/>James Wan brilliantly directs Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, and Lili Taylor in the horror flick, The Conjuring. This film is based on the true story of paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren. The Warren's are desperately called upon by Carolyn and Roger Perron to investigate their farmhouse which appears to be terrorized by an evil entity. The audience is taken on a journey similar to that of The Exorcist (1973), The Others (2001), and House at the End of the Street (2012). To my surprise; however, I am pleased with the resolution.<br/><br/>Wan is able to differentiate The Conjuring from The Exorcist, The Others, and House at the End of the Street by getting to the root of the problem and having an answer to the WHY scenario. In The Exorcist, the audience is creeped out by an inhumane entity that leaches itself onto a young girl forcing her to have extraordinary behaviors while The Others interrogates the residents of an old English mansion leaving its audience with the OH. MY. GOD. ARE. YOU. SERIOUS? reaction. House at the End of the Street leaves its viewers with an uneasiness of a psychopathic killer whom is predicted before the ending arises.<br/><br/>In each of these films a resolution has yet to be justified. If THEY (current occupants) move to another house, city, state...location, doesn't that give the enemy power and satisfaction knowing it succeeds into scaring the residents into another direction ultimately giving power to the darkness, the ghosts, essentially the protagonist? The Conjuring squashes any intention of house-hopping. 'IT attaches itself to this family like a piece of gum. Once you step on a piece of gum it's stuck wherever you go.' By facing the fear of darkness, an uneasiness births into something admirable about humanity. Not only is the existence of God in question, but the Evil that prevails within the human race.<br/><br/>I must add though, I'm most horrified, not by The Conjuring, but the incidence that I witness in the theater before the lights dim and the advertisements inundate the screen. And, that is, as I am patiently waiting in my cushioned seat, two young gentlemen approach the theater. Both, I say, in their early-twenties are trying to find the ""perfect"" seat in which they can screen the anticipation of this mind-boggling-scare-me-to-death-masterpiece. As I pretend to be amused by their indecisiveness the next thing I know one of the guys pulls something out from the crotch of his pants that he smuggles into the theater (a no-no, I might add). As he whips out this object he stares me in the eyes and says, ""Summer sausage..you know how it is."" He then peels it like a banana and slowly sinks his teeth into it. Now that folks is what I call horrifying!"

","First of all, I'd like to say that I am a huge James Wan fan. The first Saw movie is the only one with a brain and quite frankly the only one worth watching, Dead Silence was in my mind, underrated and under-appreciated. Insidious was pure horror genius. And now The Conjuring.<br/><br/>It's a very well made movie. The tension builds at an almost unbearable pace seemingly to the point where you're craving the first big jump moment. Then it doesn't come. Not that it's a bad thing. It just means that it's a well constructed narrative.<br/><br/>James Wan takes his time with the movie and the story. It is clear that he isn't just going for the cheap scare. He introduces the characters as people, not just as future victims. This should be a cardinal rule in horror filmmaking, but sadly with the influx of torture porn and badly made remakes over the past ten years, it has gone by the wayside. A+ for The Conjuring in developing three dimensional characters that we actually care about. Let's be honest, when a dumb blonde that just had sex in the woods gets murdered by the ax wielding maniac, you don't give a damn and you know it.<br/><br/>Besides character development, The Conjuring has a lot going for it. I've seen a lot of praise for the actors in the film, but I think the movie would have been just as good if some guys other than Ron Livingston and Patrick Wilson played the male leads. Livingston adds nothing to the character, Patrick Wilson is fine, but horror fans and James Wan fans alike will now forever see him as only the dad from Insidious. The real attributes should go to the female actors in the film. Vera Farmiga plays a beautifully haunted medium who has recently been through a terrifying experience that has and will forever change her. She does not let on to the Perron family about how conflicted and scared she is to proceed with their case, but she trudges through for the sole purpose to help this innocent family in need of her services. Well done, Ms. Farmiga. The other acting highlight should go to Lili Taylor for playing two roles in the film. First, she plays the sweet and loving matriarch of the Perron family, Carolyn. Later on in the film, you see her transform as the demonic presence takes ahold of her. I wont reveal too much about this scene because I hate when I read a review and it spoils a key scene in the movie. The last twenty minutes will have you gripping the arms of your chair.<br/><br/>Now, for the bad news. The Conjuring falls short with the subject matter that it tries to tackle. By no fault of it's own, I might add. It's like trying to recreate The Last Supper or chisel a new Statue of David. You might make beautiful work. Virtually flawless in lots of ways, but there's just one thing wrong. What you are trying to do has already been perfected. The Conjuring takes on the subject of demonic possession, and does so in great entertaining fashion. The problem is you're never going to beat The Exorcist. By even attempting the same subject matter, you are giving yourself an unfair disadvantage and automatically putting yourself in second place. Sorry Mr. Wan. Your movie is awesome but it's still a silver medal.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: James Wan has done it again. Go for the scares, the psychological edge and the brilliant performances by Lili Taylor and Vera Farmiga. If nothing else, there's a creepy ass doll that will give you nightmares by itself.<br/><br/>The Conjuring: 8/10 For more reviews, go to www.imdbag.com"
"vaghatz","8","0","1","5 August 2013"," Finally a great horror movie!
","As a movie I rate it 8/10, but as a horror thriller I rate is a 10/10. My girlfriend and I are huge thriller fans and lately we were trying to find a decent thriller to watch to scare us and have some kind of plot. After watching a lot of thrillers such as 'Inside', 'The frontier(s)', the 'Eden Lake' and 'The midnight meat train', we were so angry and disappointed with what the genre has become. All of them was just CGI gore porn, like it was some kind of competition, which film will have the most gruesome gore. No plot, not scary, no acting, no conclusion, no nothing, just meaningless gore.<br/><br/>Finally, we stumble upon this film. Great acting, REALLY REALLY scary (we spent all the time hiding our eyes with our hands, I unfortunately have to admit!), interesting plot, immersive, everything a great thriller should be. What a refreshing feeling finding out that some directors still care and put the effort to make you genuinely scared. <br/><br/>There is still hope!"

","The Conjuring is this year's most anticipated movie for me. Every year I have a great hope for every horror and mostly it's just another disappointment. However James Wan really managed to terrify a lot of people including me.<br/><br/>Movie tells a real story of Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) Warrens - spouses who have been investigating paranormal activities during whole their lives - and their one particular case, that was held in secret for many years because of its violate and unsolved nature. <br/><br/>In 1971 the Parren's family moved to a new house, which ought to be a start of their new life, but they never imagined what ""new"" was supposed to mean. From the very first day they faced some unnatural and unexplained phenomenon, that disturbed everybody and especially their 5 minor children. Caroline Parren asks for help to Warrens and they start investigation which leads to a dreadful chain of events. <br/><br/>Story begins with closer look at Ed and Lorraine - their job and relationship and one of easy cases of ""evil doll"". Then it switches to Parren's family and then those to families unite for the whole movie. Lorraine who is a medium finds a lot spirits in the house, but one of them is the most dangerous seeking for revenge. She believes that exorcism is the only way out and resettlement of family does not help at all. But before that, they have to investigate, get prove of existence of supernatural and then ask for help to church. And after this, everything gets complicated. Involvement of outsiders make soul angrier and it starts to attack each of residing in the house.<br/><br/>The Conjuring has a plot of average horror movie - devils, murders, child killer mothers, music box, souls and dead babies. Actually the story mostly develops pretty predictably but it has something very important most of horrors lack - scare. This film brings so much of it that I've been jumping during whole seance. Wan has used a lot sound effects very successfully that actually made the whole movie very enjoyable. Also, the Conjuring is a good mix of some documentary material and fiction, bringing freshness to scary emotions.<br/><br/>The reason why The Conjuring is a strong work is that it really frightens any (or most) viewer. It is not smart, or very original but it is worth spending some money on ticket. It has a lot of moments of sudden sound or visual effects which take your breath away. From the first minutes until the end nothing seems wrong. There are several moments with huge jumps, that really shake each cell of your body and then it is followed by long tension - a calm psychologically suppressing events that also culminates with another huge scare. And this goes on until the last minute of picture, does not giving a sec to restore powers and collect yourself. <br/><br/>The idea of being a true story has its charm. Most of people in the movie are real. Lorraine is actually alive at the age of 86, her husband died in 2006. Parren's family are real people who have told this story themselves. And the feeling that all these happened some times before just kills you. <br/><br/>Additionally, the last scene of exorcism is one of the finest horror scenes I've ever seen - truly terrifying, emotional and impressive. Yes it all comes down to sounds and effects and James Wan with his team managed to combine this supporting features for the best. <br/><br/>As for cast, Vera Farmiga is great - she makes a great horror character. But Joey King stole the whole show, playing one of the first victim Parren children. Her emotions are so real as if she was really seeing ghosts in her room. The rest of cast work as they are supposed to and this does not happen very often in horror movies. <br/><br/>The thing I did not like much and I could be willing to change is the end. It could be as horrifying as the whole 112 minutes of it. But still The Conjuring is not movie one can reject because of its not effective or lame finish. Because everybody, who wants a horror that won't let you sleep in dark room, can get it. Thus this is genuinely best movie of its genre of last decade and this years my top film so far."

","Okay so I'm a 25 year old male. Saw this movie with a buddy. We try to get to all the scary movies that come out and are almost always disappointed. This is the best one I've seen in a long time. We somewhat pride ourselves on not getting scared during the movie. Well at least 3 times both of us jumped up like little girls. And because we see so many movies you feel like you know when those moments are coming but James Wan mixed it up. Not very easy to predict that's for sure. You really might have trouble sleeping after this one. I know I was waiting to hear a *Clap* all night after watching it. You'll know what that means if you go see it. Oh yeah I almost forgot the doll. The doll scared the ever loving poop out of me. (Not a Spoiler)"
"kumarsumeet07","10","0","2","5 August 2013"," Better Than Any Recent Horror Movie...........An instant gem among the classic horror titles.
","This latest movie from Saw director James Wan goes down a fairly traditional haunted house film route. In it, a regular family move into a new home and are immediately terrorised by a malevolent ghost; a married couple who specialise in dealing with paranormal activity are called in to help exorcise the evil spirit. It was seemingly based on a true story. From the above synopsis you could be forgiven for thinking that this is a re-tread of the likes of The Amityville Horror and Poltergeist. And I suppose in many ways you would be correct as the influence of these types of films is pretty evident. But that would only be half the story because The Conjuring is a film that definitely stands up on its own right and for my money is one of the very best horror films of the last few years. The chief reason for this is simply that at times it is very scary indeed. It's not a graphic horror film at all; it relies on the fear of the unknown and the unseen. It combines lots of the things that make traditional ghost stories so sinister – an old house, a hidden room, a witch, tragic histories, possession, creepy old children's toys and, of course, well-placed jump scares. This movie has all of these elements and uses them well. It doesn't necessarily bring a lot of new things to the genre but what it does do is expertly arrange several traditional ideas into a very satisfying whole.<br/><br/>On top of all this, it's a very well-acted affair. Particularly impressive are Vera (The Departed) Farmiga and Patrick (Hard Candy) Wilson who play the paranormal experts. They have a definite chemistry with one-and-other and bring a solid believability to their characters. And pleasingly they play things completely straight. Also of interest is the time period. Seeing as this is based around true events, its set in 1971. As well as being more authentic to the story, this has the added benefit of having a retro feel that harks back to the classic 70's American horror movies in which it derives much of its influence. And there is something refreshing in immersing yourself in a world without mobile phones and tweeting; a world without such things seems to work better as far as traditional haunted house stories go.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an excellent horror film. If I had to criticise it in one way it would simply be that the intense finale wasn't as creepy as the build-up. The reason for that is really down to the fact that the slower build-up allows for moments that hit you out of left-field from nowhere and the quieter more deliberately paced sequences can be constructed up to a real genuine fright scene. By the end we know the source of the haunting and we are constantly tensed up during the final encounter meaning it doesn't have the same impact as the earlier scary moments. But I have to emphasise that this is really a very minor point and I really highly recommend The Conjuring to horror fans and more specifically those who like films about ghosts. Great stuff."
"rbn_lrk-1","8","0","2","5 August 2013"," The Conjuring
","Based upon true events a family had moved into an old house by a forest. The days passes as unusual things happens. Ed and Lorraine Warren comes by, and Lorraine has a special talent. The old house is having a dark past that comes by every night. It's not a gore filled thrill ride, but invisible entities that suddenly shows up. If you are searching for things like Ed and Lorraine that really lived go watch this movie. Ed and Lorraine are also having a museum with things from haunted houses. Some of the highlights are the history of a doll the pair is having at the museum. The scenery contains a dreadful wilderness where people got lost, and a cellar with a dusty piano and on. Of sound it is effective with loud music and sounds like frames suddenly falling down. If you want to see one of the Blockbuster highlights at the remains of this summer go here. Or wait for a Blu Ray release for a perfect Halloween event. 10/10"

The conjuring is the true story of a family which makes it more scary . This movie scares you all over the time and the acting of whole cast make the movie perfect. Everyone who comes on the screen have done a great job specially Patrick Wilson and vera farmiga were brilliant.

"Robert_duder","8","0","2","4 August 2013"," A solid scarer that will leave any horror fan satisfied
","A few months ago I decided to do my very best to steer clear of trailers. I was simply finding that they were ruining movies for me. So I am proud to say that I didn't see a single trailer for The Conjuring. However, word of mouth was strong on this one. I had heard nothing but terrific things about this and how incredibly scary it was. By the time I went to see it my anticipation was very high. The Conjuring delivers exactly what you would expect. It absolutely met my expectations and satisfied me nearly completely. That being said it did nothing to exceed my expectations and it isn't the best horror flick I've seen (that honour goes squarely to the Evil Dead remake.) It also wasn't nearly as good as Insidious which was far creepier but it was still excellently crafted, well told, well acted and entertaining. There were also some genuinely creepy moments though I felt like it didn't really push my limits. The Conjuring has one significant flaw that held it back in my opinion and that was that it was predictable and cookie cutter and re-hashed material we have seen before in similar ""exorcism"" type stories including Insidious. However, don't get me wrong because that did not make it less entertaining, it just stopped it from truly outstanding.<br/><br/>I really like Patrick Wilson. I have enjoyed his Television work and the movies I have seen of his. He has a subtle quality about his performances that make him seem down to earth and very relate-able. His performance in this film is captivating and he leads the cast well. He is believable and commanding in his role. Not to be outdone Vera Farmiga is also very good. The two of them together are very good and have great chemistry. They are captivating as the husband and wife paranormal investigators. Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor are the devoted couple whose family is being terrorized by spirits in their new home. Both are good but certainly supporting actors compared to Wilson and Farmiga. Still as the desperate parents they fit the roles very well. Their daughters are played by Shanley Caswell, Hayley McFarland, Joey King, Mackenzie Foy and Kyla Deaver. They are all very good in the role but none of them really stand out either. The cast all work so well together and everyone fits their roles perfectly. Wilson and Farmiga are the focus and everyone else supports them and it works.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that James Wan is a brilliant horror director. I am basing that off the brilliance of the Saw series as a whole and Insidious and now this. He has a desire to tell a good solid story and still scare you. I think he is easily impressionable from horror films he loves and it translates well into his stories. The entire idea of the room of haunted items was really well done and the doll was downright disturbing. The problem is that everything felt a little been there and done that. It was like watching a great exorcism movie but one that you have seen before. Regardless of that though horror fans will thoroughly enjoy this and it is a great ghost story/possession movie that you won't be disappointed with. 8/10"

"rooee","6","0","1","4 August 2013"," Something new, something old
","James Wan directed the original (and best) Saw, the poorly received Dead Silence, and later Insidious, Chapter 2 of which will be his second movie of 2013. He's developing into a modern Master of Horror, but it looks like he may be removing himself from that typecasting as he prepares to direct the seventh instalment of Fast & Furious, which presumably won't involve any dead-eyed smiling dolls. It would be a pity if he was done with horror, because The Conjuring is a very good horror movie. What it is NOT is original. At all. It's more like a greatest hits of the genre, specifically the exorcism sub-genre.<br/><br/>The plot, based on ""actual events"" (a claim which, if anything, nullifies some of the terror), involves the wholesome Perron family (helmed by Ron Livingston and Lili Taylor) moving into a rustic farmhouse, which is frankly begging to be haunted. The fact that there are no less than five daughters gives ample opportunity for creepy blindfold games and exploration, and soon they're unwittingly uncovering the gruesome secret past of the house and grounds. As the hauntings mount up, the Ma and Pa Perron call in demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga). They're the ones who ""did"" Amityville. Cameras and microphones are set up to gather evidence, so that they can apply for an exorcism. At this point the movie becomes like Poltergeist, except actually scary.<br/><br/>A film this formulaic shouldn't work, but the ferociously familiar elements - rocking chairs, doors, whispers, crashes, dolls, Catholics, imaginary friends, mirrors, music boxes, mirrors inside music boxes - are presented so skilfully by both cast and crew that it's hard not to be drawn in. The performances are first rate; the cinematography is exquisite; the pacing is perfect; and the script is better than it needs to be, with some moving moments as sanity levels slip away. These ""real life"" evil demons seem to have an uncanny knack for patiently building tension and teasing their audience - I mean victims - before they get on with the really nasty stuff. But that build-up makes for a riveting three quarters of a film.<br/><br/>As the film picks up steam it also picks up some annoying habits - specifically the tendency of modern horror to confuse the scary with the startling, and resort to increasing physicality, shouting, and crash cuts as a crescendo to the effective slow-burn. Put it this way: A little girl telling her sister there's someone standing behind her stays with you longer than a grown woman being tossed around like a ragdoll.<br/><br/>This almost feels like a full-stop for the traditional mainstream horror movie; a distillation of all that the genre does well, done very well. Perhaps it's Wan's way of signing off, closing the book on things that go bump and clocks that stop at unearthly hours, to allow some new visionary to come along and try something new. But this one last time the old ways work just fine."

The plot of the story is excellent and trailer was also really well put together! My favorite kind of movies would be the Scream trilogy but I have to say, I did enjoy this film too! The fact that it was based on a true story just gave it that extra boost!

"pseawrig","5","0","1","4 August 2013"," so-so summer horror
","There are reasons to recommend this film: Lilly Taylor, Vera Farmiga, and Ron Livingston turn in strong performances, the rustic sets and rural locations are very atmospheric, and the realistic cinematography creates the creepy ambiance of seventies horror. In addition, the story has a couple of well-crafted scares. Still, the plot unfolds like an episode of A Haunting. It just doesn't feel big enough for a movie. One problem may be that the film never fully develops a single character's point of view. It seems unsure of whose story to tell, with its focus artlessly split between the desperate mom and the haunted psychic. As a result, the film does not delve all that deeply into its horror. If you are expecting a retro horror to rival seventies classics, such as The Exorcist, The Omen, or Phantasm, you will probably be disappointed. If you are looking for a boisterous summer horror flick, like the Amityville Horror or Poltergeist, you may be pleased. Me, I thought the film was okay but forgettable . . . perhaps a better fit for people who do not really like horror movies than for horror connoisseurs."

","Going to the movies should be entertaining; it can be scary or funny, and every once in a while a tear- jerker gets thrown in there. This is how we 'genre-nize' movies so in the future we may easily choose similar titles to itself. The Conjuring cannot be genre-nized so easily. The trailer allows you to think it as a supernatural horror without the cheap, slasher thrills; a film equal to The Ring or A Haunting in Connecticut, which couldn't be further from the truth. The Conjuring somehow combines every fear imaginable without becoming cliché. It won me over by evoking primal senses that rarely get experienced in my day to day. The Conjuring is feral, to say the least...it plays with your mind in order to elicit a visceral, heart-pounding affect. I will never be the same knowing what my eyes and ears witnessed at this horror's opening night.

","I didn't let those rave reviews get to me and I didn't get my hope up like I did last year with Sinister , which I thought trailer was great but the movie was HUGE let down and found the movie very boring and dull and not creepy or at all scary, other part of the movie that really annoyed me and I fell sleep in some scenes <br/><br/>So that is the reason I didn't get hope up to much for this year Horror movie THE CONJURING (2013) , First of all the trailer did make this look it was going to full of those scary jumps scene that don't last for then one two seconds and I do think they showed a little to much in the trailer. <br/><br/>I clad I didn't get my hope up to high for this movie, it was really good horror movie, it dose not any new ground that not already seen. <br/><br/>Saying that I did really enjoy the whole movie, I found that did prefer the first half of the movie, where the strange thing started to happen to each member of the family. <br/><br/>There were some really good decent creepy scenes in the movie that lasted much longer then those 2 seconds jump scarce you normal see in horror movie these days. <br/><br/>Other think I liked about this movie they didn't really try to make you jump at all they wanted to creepy you and keep you clued to the screen the on time. <br/><br/>I wasn't to keen on last half hour of the movie, it cause it seen those scenes done many times in the recent years, it get a bit boring and very predicable however the scenes it was not boring which is a really good thing. <br/><br/>I was hoping for more of aftermath of the thing that just happened but it ended a bit soon after the story came to a end. <br/><br/>I didn't get what last scenes about could not make What I meant to be seeing! <br/><br/>it was very good and very creepy horror!

","The Conjuring is one of the most genuinely creepy films to have come in a very very long time.James Wan had shown sparks of brilliance in the horror department in Insidious and Dead silence(which is surprisingly underrated) but here he goes full throttle to horrify the viewers with every trick up in his sleeve.<br/><br/>Right from the opening credits, this movie has a ""been there,seen that"" feeling but startles you with its effective simplicity.With such aplomb does it showcases its moments of scares, that you clap when the ghost claps, you hide when something unexpected is going to be revealed, and most importantly, you feel what the victims in the family are going through.The film starts rather slowly and takes time to build up but as the supernatural occurrences start to happen,the thrill gets to you and you cannot but be at the edge of your seat and occasionally even jumping out of your seat.Yes,there are quite a few dare-scare moments which have been placed very well in the movie with good build up to them in the form of scenes portraying deep emotions and some scenes evoking laughter as well.<br/><br/>It takes quite a doing when you have to recreate a bygone era in a horror film and more so, since the odds have been against recent filmmakers who have failed in the recent past to provide a genuinely good horror film employing all techniques they could like shaky-cams and torture-porn to titillate the viewer's senses.But James Wan aided by superb camera-work and sound design goes old-school this time which works in his favour as the imagery and the build up sets you up for some genuine scares as in the classic horror films just that here James uses some deft camera-work to make the frightening moments like you have never seen before. The principal cast scores well with sound performances from Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson(James' favorite horror actor) as the paranormal investigators and sympathetically effective ones from Lili Taylor and Ron Livingstone as the Perron family experiencing the increasingly disturbing events in their newly bought farmhouse.<br/><br/>Entertaining to the core, and frightening as hell- this movie is my Hollywood movie of the summer and makes me believe that there is still some hope in the classic horror genre.Hope that ""Insidious-II"", James' next project establishes that and continues the genre revival."
"DareDevilKid","9","0","2","4 August 2013"," Easily Among The Top 50 Horror Movies Of All Time
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 4.1/5 stars<br/><br/>James Wan (""Saw"", ""Insidious""), has carved out yet another horror masterpiece. ""The Conjuring"" is psychologically disturbing and also scary as hell. Mr. Wan delectably creates palpable tension and a nerve- wracking atmosphere by smartly playing around with camera angles and lights - laudable qualities that he's already exhibited in his previous efforts.<br/><br/>But there are also plenty of jump-scare moments, without the Director resorting to any cheap thrills or mundane horror clichés. The plot though not novel, is based on a true story and is executed with gusto and freshness. Among the performances, Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, and Lili Taylor truly stand out.<br/><br/>The penultimate scene and the epic climax - again to the Director's credit - are among the best ever in horror movie history - and that's really something considering the plethora of classics ""The Conjuring"" is stacked against. Mr. James Wan - please take a bow once again. You Sir, shall definitely cement your position one day among the likes of Wes Craven, Dario Argento, Frank Darabont, and other masters of horror films."

"rossp836","7","0","1","4 August 2013"," A solid horror film
","I'm not really all that sure what to think of The Conjuring. After reading several rave reviews and many ""omg, scariest film ever!!"" tweets, I went to go see it last night. <br/><br/>This film is scary. There is absolutely no denying that. The film follows a fairly typical series of events, of course beginning with the bumps in the night, the mysterious stoppings of the clocks in the house (and the somewhat expected death of the dog...come on, we knew it wasn't going to live long out there). These happenings across the house help to build an intense tension which thoroughly had me on the edge of my seat. When the mother becomes possessed, the film thankfully doesn't go too over the top, and the scene where she's facing her husband smiling like a...well, possessed woman was utterly blood chilling. However, I found the end of the film to be just a little on the cheesy side. The whole ""yay, mummy's not possessed anymore, group hug with big smiles!"" and the cheery music was a little corny. <br/><br/>My biggest issue however, is that the plot is a little confusing. The film begins in an apartment (I believe?), with two women and a male describing how they believe a toy doll is possessed. Then, the film cuts to the family moving into their new house. The doll has been placed under the watchful eye of two ghost-hunters, and doesn't feature until the climax of the film, where it doesn't play any key role. I felt that the beginning of the film and the rest of it were a little disjointed. <br/><br/>Overall, I'd say that The Conjuring was an enjoyable watch. The creepy goings ons around the house, and the extremely unnerving climax to the film featuring an exorcism provide a truly scary watch. The film however stumbles a little due to the confusing plot line. 7/10."
"vinsond21","8","0","2","4 August 2013"," 40 years after The Exorcist, here's a new classic
","Like The Exorcist made 40 years earlier, this feature is based on a true story, taken from the case files of husband-and-wife paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. Although the set up is familiar enough, the execution and delivery are solid and assured in the capable hands of director James Wan. The screenplay nicely balances the drama and suspense, and unlike many other offerings in this genre, has hardly any gaps in logic. The acting is superlative; Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor are especially affecting as the wives/mothers particularly vulnerable to the proceedings. There are horror movies like Jeepers Creepers that just aim to scare and succeed in that department. The Conjuring, on the other hand, is not just about being scary but leaves the viewer gasping because what took place really happened and can happen to anyone. Let this therefore be a cautionary tale as well."
"mmchugh108","6","0","1","3 August 2013"," Almost Great
","This movie is not your usual throwaway trashy slash flick built strictly to take money from teenagers with nothing better to do. It has all the under pinning to be a horror great. Was it full of cliché? Yeah. Clearly this was part of the design, so it didn't bother me. But despite the fact that they did the detailed work to make it look like 1971, despite the great cast, they tell you it's November in Rhode Island and the leaves are full and green in the trees. That's just one example of the laziness that plagues this almost great horror flick. Just have a clue and call it September! There are so many details that just don't get integrated into a coherent whole. Where the locket come from? Did it come from the high security room full of ""manipulated objects?"" If not where? And what is the point? And who was sitting with the doll in that room? This movie threatens to be very dark in a few spots and, well, . . . it's Hollywood where the East Coast is just a foreign vision where the leaves are green in November. Was there a more interesting original story that got chewed up and digested for the screenplay babyfood? See this movie and enjoy it. But prepare for nagging and unnecessary disappointment."
"achyutaghosh","10","0","3","3 August 2013"," True story, truly scary
","Am not an easy man to scare. Countless movies have gone by, yet rarely have i been scared like the way I was today by The Conjuring. At first glance, it is easy to write it off- haunted house as a horror theme has been ground to dust. But oh so much dust it does raise, because together with the well constructed chills inter-spaced with wry humor and excellent acting, surely, this must rank as one of the finest horror movies of this decade.<br/><br/>""Something awful happened here""<br/><br/>The Conjuring has all the staples of a horror movie- innocent victims, statuesque haunted farmhouse complete with a tree to ""hang on"", oak wardrobes, wooden dolls, creaky floorboards, foul odors, Salem witches, cellars and other dark places. Set in the fashionable 70s, the Warrens, Ed(Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are successful and well respected ghost hunters. Together they are a good team- Ed is all authoritative, Lorraine is all empathy. They are contacted by the Perrons to investigate paranormal occurrences in Massachusetts, a close investigation of which reveal a generations old evil that begins acting up as the movie progresses. <br/><br/>Director James Wan already explored this theme is his earlier classic- Insidious. In addition to doffing his cap to classics like Exorcist, Poltergeist, Amityville Horror and The Birds, he exhibits mastery over the most important aspect of a horror movie- its tempo. He allows a slow build up, then the lull, followed by the storm. Walls crash, chairs fly, birds crash into windows, the possessed retch and levitate at will as a phenomenally intense climax builds up. All this is achieved with minimal blood and visual effects, unlike The Evil Dead remake. The acting overall is excellent, you feel what the Perrons are going through- their togetherness, their joy, their shock and later, their terror. The music is sheer class, and a pair of clapping hands never was so creepy. <br/><br/>The Conjuring is an ode then to man's primordial joy of getting scared. It's only flaw maybe its predictability, but it's treatment is honest and simple. As a result even the most rational viewer will keep looking back when alone in the dark. Horror fans rejoice- yours prayers have finally been answered, here is a modern day classic at last. PS- if you feel the poster picture is tame, watch the movie to find out what happens right after this scene :)"
"YasheshJ","8","0","3","3 August 2013"," In total accordance with general consensus, indeed one of the better made horror flicks in recent times.
","Plot: Parren family moves to a beautiful country house, soon to find out it's haunted. The Warrens—supernatural researchers—are the only ones who can help.<br/><br/>Based on real life accounts of Parren family's paranormal experiences with demonic entities and Warren couple helping them out, The Conjuring has a very generic plot that is just about perfectly executed.<br/><br/>Director James Wan explores the well-worn horror sub-genre 'haunted house in remote country' and comes up trump. It is indeed one of the better crafted horror films in recent times—punching well above its weight all through—that is buoyed up by solid performances from all and sundry.<br/><br/>The film doesn't simply surge into action, it first sets up an eerie atmosphere that envelops the viewers, yet steers clear of any yawn inducing moments. At the same time, it isn't overcrowded with exaggerated spooky moments either, just enough to keep the audiences on the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Post-film, ""Hide-and-clap"" is definitely going to be the in-thing (along the lines of Bloody Mary, if you recall that). There are some well accomplished, decisive scenes around clairvoyant Mrs.Warren's perceptive visions—watch out for ones by the gloomy lake! Moreover, it isn't just a hard-core horror film that taxes you no end, there are some very dulcet family-time scenes and lighthearted humor too, that eventually make viewers feel/care more for the characters.<br/><br/>Best part was watching the film in good, old 2D with bare minimum digital effects.<br/><br/>Overall, a good watch—experience enhanced more because of a well-engaged, reactive yet disciplined, theater audience! 7.7/10"
"amitashb803","9","0","2","3 August 2013"," Good horror movie with old fashioned scares.
","Reportedly based on true story, renowned paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, are called upon to investigate the most frightening & baffling case of their career. In 1971, Roger and Carolyn Perron have left suburban New Jersey with their five daughters to move to Rhode Island. But Perrons' hope for a peaceful new start is soon ruined by a powerful otherworldly entity intent on waging war against them. James Wan, director of Saw and Insidious, injects a relatively tired concept with some life here, via a neat narrative spin. Unlike most haunted house thrillers, The Conjuring doesn't focus solely on the family terrorized by a demonic entity from beyond the grave. Instead, screenwriters give us tandem narratives, framing the story within the history of the Warrens. It's a smart move, preventing us from growing too irritated with the Perron family. Wilson and Farmiga are personable and great at conveying hidden pain while Taylor and Livingston are authentic and likable. There's a lot here you'll have seen before if you're a fan of the genre. The Perrons' dog is spooked out upon arrival at the farmhouse, Roger feels compelled to investigate the dark, dangerous basement, and if a character in jeopardy suddenly pauses in apparent relief, you can be sure something will make you jump in around few seconds time. The body count is low, bloodshed is minimal & gore effects are limited to minimal towards the end. Is The Conjuring scariest movie ever made? No. But that doesn't stop film from being an enjoyable thrill ride in theater."
"advaitkamat","6","0","1","3 August 2013"," Genuinely scary.
","I'm not a big follower of horror movies because I always perceive them as mere distractions. Squeeze a proper horror film tight and all you get is a murky story that thrives on gore and special effects. They're made with a sole aim to shock you, to creep you out enough so that you know that this experience has been worth the wait. But that's not the case with ""The Conjuring"". It is a more archaic version of an clichéd plot of a demonic spirit that spooks a family that has just moved into their new home. And spook it does, being so gleefully scary and wonderfully crafted that it's one of the better horror films I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>In 1971, Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) move into a new countryside house with their five daughters. From the first night, they notice strange things happening when they go to sleep. Doors open and shut of their own accord, their daughters complain of someone pulling their legs in the middle of the night. A rotten smell wafts through the place all day long. But when Carolyn notices bruise marks beginning to form on her limbs, she grows suspicious. Once, while investigating strange clap noises, her fears are confirmed. She seeks the help of two demonologists and paranormal investigators, Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who agree to perform an exorcism on the house after they catch the unusual happenings on tape. But when Lorraine figures out what the demon really wants, she finds that the task will be a lot tougher than she had initially guessed when her family is also targeted by it.<br/><br/>Director James Wan, who had gained a substantial amount of notoriety for his 2004 film ""Saw"", a whole new evaluation of the genre but complete detritus intellectually, certainly knows his thing. The tension mounts gradually, with just the creaking floorboards and moving objects giving you the chills in the first-half, and Wan slyly exploits the baffling episodes to magnificent effect. I've got to say, creaking doors have never creeped me out so much. These are old tricks, you see, with the abandoned farmhouse and dark history behind it, there's bound to be a creaking door somewhere. And when the demonic spirit restlessly stealths and haunts the Perrons, you are assured to have a tough time staying in your seats. The premise is simple, yes, but it's also supremely effective. Minus the loud sound effects and garishly-dressed ghosts, the film is one of those rare ones that alarms solely because of its tension and some smart filmmaking. My favorite sequence in the film, the one that spooked me the most, was a comparably mellow sequence in which Carolyn plays hide-and-clap with her youngest daughter. It's the first shocker of the film and a memorable one, smartly-directed and petrifying to the boot.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" works rather well in the first-half but gets increasingly smudgy in the second. After the demon is finally revealed, the plot goes terribly awry. Then come the floppy investigations and supernatural observations, wherein Lorraine sees visions of an old witch who is now haunting the family. The scares keep coming though, but they seem to shabby to invest in. The exorcism scene in its climax is caricatural and the memories of the 1971 horror masterpiece ""The Exorcist"" make it look laughably awful in comparison. But Wan's too smart a filmmaker to let this blemish the film.<br/><br/>Of the performances, none of them are memorable but they aren't bad either. Wilson and Farmiga are largely convincing in their respective roles. Taylor manages to give a potent performance, which is a surprise considering she started out as an incongruous accessory but she maintained a dignified presence as the story progressed.<br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" isn't a great horror film but it's satisfyingly scary. Based on a true story, it is a believable account of the terror a family witnessed but as a film, it doesn't work after a while and ends on a whimper. Still, it unnerved me enough to rob me of my sleep for a while. And I can't pay it a higher compliment than that."

","For reader's information I am not a big time horror fan. I have seen other horror films like the Paranormal Activity series, and some of the Amityville horror movies, and also some other movies like Insidious and the Poltergeist. I was not a fan of any of these movies because they either did not have enough suspense or showed too much of the apparitions. I went into this movie with some excitement because I've wanted to see a well done haunted house movie. Well 10 minutes into the movie I was given was I asked for and more. The movie was everything I hoped for: Spooky horror with a good underlying story. I was so engaged into this movie that I left the theater still thinking about it for the night, and trust me, this was one of the scariest films I've seen. This is not an original work, but it is the most well acted and filmed(cinematography) by far, and the best thing about it is how real it feels. The director Wan did a great job of not revealing too much about the apparitions. Just like every haunted house film, you will ask yourself, why don't they just leave? They give a good explanation with this. This is a movie you wish could go on and on."

","The Conjuring is an outstanding nostalgic horror film, a vast improvement over the disappointing horror films of the past couple of years. It abandons the cheap jump scares in favor of slowly building up the tension to the final event and creating that great creepy, unsettling feeling of an old style horror film. James wan does an excellent job as director and the film holds together very well with great performances by all the cast especially Vera Farmiga (Lorraine Warren) and Lili Taylor (Carolyn Perron). The script is wonderfully paced, prepping us for the ghostly realm by opening with a more fun, but still creepy story about the Annabelle doll and the haunted past of Ed and Lorraine Warren adds depth and complexity to their involvement. There is a small lull about 2/3 in but the film gets quickly back on track. Overall its quite entertaining film"

"tomassparups","7","0","1","2 August 2013"," Unsettling, rather than scary. 7.5/10
","James Wan's ""The Conjuring"" is one of my most anticipated films of this year. Wan, the director of the original ""Saw"" film as well as 2011's ""Insidious"" has a fair amount of experience in the field of horror. Although, he has had some missteps, 2007's ""Dead Silence"" was a joke of a horror film and did not live up to the expectations set by his previous work. He is also directing the upcoming sequel to ""Insidious"", which I am looking forward to. His newest film, ""The Conjuring"" is packed with an all star cast. Starring are Vera Farmiga, Lily Taylor, Ron Livingston and Patrick Wilson. Based on the true story of famed paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga), who have participated in such paranormal investigations as the infamous ""Amityville Horror"" case as well as many others. The film is centered around their supposedly ""most terrifying"" case that has not been revealed until now. In the first few scenes we see the Perron family, Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor), Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) and their many daughters. They are moving into their new home, a remote farmhouse located in Rhode Island. Having settled in, the family heads to bed. In the morning, they wake up to find that every single clock in the house has stopped at exactly 3:07 AM as well as a foul stench seeping through the floor and walls. Not to mention a shocking discover made by their youngest daughter, Christine. Over the course of a few days, strange events begin to occur in the Perron house and it becomes evident that something is terribly wrong. In desperate strides to protect her family, Carolyn seeks the help of noted paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, it takes her some convincing, but the two decide to help her. After inspecting the Perron house, it is clear to the Warren's that something evil has latched itself onto it.<br/><br/>First of all, I will say that I greatly enjoyed this film, but it did not genuinely frighten me. Normally, I would dismiss a horror film if it would fail to frighten me, but in the case of ""The Conjuring"" there is so much more backing up the film that the scares don't feel as important as they should. This is a very well made film, the set design and camera-work showcase James Wan's impressive directorial presence as well as set up a chilling atmosphere. If I were to pick a work to describe my feelings whilst watching the film, it would probably be, ""unsettled"". The entire cast deliver exceptional performances, which is no surprise when working with such highly talented actors. My main problem with ""The Conjuring"" is that at times it feels very predictable and uninspired story wise. Other than that, I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Conjuring"". I am convinced that James Wan has the potential to be a fantastic director.<br/><br/>It did not scare me, but the fantastic production value and the performances delivered by the actors along with James Wan's eerie direction had me invested in the film all the way through. ""The Conjuring"" managed to unsettle me as well as provide a gripping story and worthwhile characters."

","I am only 13 years old, and have not seen many horror movies. But I can honestly say that not only is The Conjuring the best scary movie I've ever seen, but one of the best films I've ever seen. Period.<br/><br/>Horror. Terror. Suspense. Thriller. Light. Darkness. Communion of spirits. That is what awaits you if you go and see The Conjuring, which you definitely should. At one point towards the end of the film, and I'm not going to spoil it, I started bawling my eyes out. And not out of fear. Out of love. Sympathy. Mercy. The triumph of light over darkness. God's warm light that leaves all the darkness behind. You can probably tell that me and my family are very religious.<br/><br/>This is not a haunting. This isn't just a possession. It's the conjuring of and inviting in of a demonic spirit that seeks to destroy the family that can't be destroyed. The family bound by love.<br/><br/>However, I must say that the R-rating given the film is very true and that the description is too vague. It should be rated R for intense sequences of supernatural violence and terror, disturbing images, and blood and gore. Not too much, though. Mainly concerning the demonic entity.<br/><br/>So go and see this movie. Witness the terrifying true story of a family bound by love and a husband and wife duo bound to protect them at God's will. Go and explore this house of darkness, this house of light.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, have you read that autobiography by Andrea Perron?<br/><br/>-A. L. Horror"

","There has been a lot of horror in the past 5 years. A lot of it seems to be in love with the ""found footage"" format which frankly is getting very tiring. I'm happy to see that not everyone thinks horror has to have a shaky first-person camera.<br/><br/>James Wan is a terrific horror director with very good instincts. He is old-school. I never caught Saw in a theater, because I'm not usually attracted to horrors that aren't fantasy (slasher-based horrors), with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre being a rare exception. But when I did catch up to Saw I was struck by its wonderful suspense and plot twisting. I am surprised, however, that Wan's directing career took a long hiatus. It seems to be firing up better now.<br/><br/>Like the rest of Wan's work, The Conjuring has strong character and plot building, and careful camera work. I've seen so many horror movies that nothing really scares me anymore, and yet Wan's Insidious chilled me in a few scenes, so I was really looking forward to The Conjuring. While I didn't feel it was quite as scary for me as Insidious, it has its moments. Sure got some screams out of the audience! And that's what's fun about seeing horrors at the theater anyway.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is alleged to be based on a true story, and I really liked the attention Wan gave not just to the victims but to the investigators, weaving the personal lives of two families around the events in a classic haunted house.<br/><br/>I will always be looking out for another James Wan movie to see!"

Full credit to the director for putting life in some old haunted stuff from which many people evade themselves watching & making it fresh, juicy still serious, intense suspense.

The show is set in an 150 year old Rhode Island house, where almost immediately moving in, the Livingston family (a couple & five daughters) start experiencing disturbing events right from their dog never entering the new house & found dead the very next day just when they weirdly & strikingly notice that clocks stop at 3:07 a.m. The chill continues till the family starts feeling the presence of a spirits which also results in scars on their bodies. It's the just the start of 3rd stage(Possession) where demonologists, The Warrens are called in (Infestation & Oppression being the first two stages) & have a look & this is when it starts getting a lot interesting. The spirit seems challenged by the presence of Warrens & starts getting out of hand for what lies ahead are a series of incidences that follow which are breathtakingly terrifying.<br/><br/>Every masterpiece leaves us with some unforgettable scenes for an our lifetimes : ""The clapping sequence scene"" is one in which the audience not only hold onto their chairs but also laugh aloud when it's over(I found myself saying whoo hoo when it was over...it's just brilliantly made) ""Do you wanna play, Clap Clap !!!"" Ah awesome!!!<br/><br/>In the second half, the movie enters into its own pace with the spirit creating havoc & the audience getting goose bumps now & then because of James Wan's cinematic scare tactics, hats off, yes again!! The use of crude technology like cameras that click photos when change in temperature, old fashioned tape recorders, UV light & sound detecting headphones are all witty inclusions indeed. All the actors deliver top class performance without any doubt & may be their acting goes unnoticed because it's too scary around :) All in all, it's the unpredictability which steals the show for me. Stellar moments, the poster itself, the setting of a big oldish farmhouse on the lake, the picture perfect huge tree with bended branches, creaky doors, superb camera angles & placements, excellent screenplay well supported by sound effects make this a must watch if you are a horror movie goer.<br/><br/>So if you feel like going in there to watch, a Warning from my side: Enter but at your own holy risk !!! njoy :))<br/><br/>——————————————————————————————<br/><br/>Censor Rating = R. Running time=112 minutes. Number of times I saw my watch = 5-6 (I was irritated by getting scared a number of times ;) ). My Rating=8.5/10 (My highest rating till date )"

","The Conjuring has non-stop, genuinely creepy moments. My skin was crawling regularly during this movie. Twenty minutes into it, I was wondering if seeing the movie at night was a mistake. Yes, it was that creepy. Add to that, the fact that the movie is based on a a true story. The Conjuring was reminiscent of The Amityville Horror (the 70s version)only scarier.<br/><br/>The movie is set in 1971. The wardrobe and autos were true to the period and elicited fond memories of the time and a chuckle or two (the plaid, double-knit tie). The adult cast all did admirable work and the five daughters were adorable.<br/><br/>The movie has little gore but excels in low-key creepiness. Don't take the kids unless you want to be up all night with traumatized kiddos."

","I love horror films and as someone who loves horror films I ask other fans is there ever a moment when you're watching something really scary and you go "" This was a mistake, I hate this crap, I can't watch this, I have to leave."" It's a very rare reaction especially in a cinematic sea or remakes, retreads and countless unnecessary sequels (not to say that some are great). The Conjuring the new film from James Wan made me have this reaction. Yes the film has all the tropes of a standard haunted house thriller but the film's smooth, ultra realistic execution is what sets it apart. The film tells the story of a family in the 70's who move into a new house and begin to experience strange occurrences. Those occurrences increase rather quickly and they list the help of the now famous paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren played perfectly by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farminga. What culminates is something truly unique and horrifying and hasn't been seen in the movies in a very long time if ever. Although it sounds fairly generic but this film is anything but. The proceedings are handled with a genre maestros finesse. Smoothly moving between each set piece to create a tapestry of terror. And to add to the films overall effect the proceedings are given an emotional girth so we care about the characters and the events going on. The film boasts solid performances all around especially from Vera Farminga, Patrick Wilson and Lili Taylor. The cinematographic is creative and top notch, the score haunting and effects nightmarish. But the star of the show here is James Wan he has effectively made a instantly classic horror film. It's finely tunes, feels very real and pacts an emotional wallop while scaring the crap out of you. Itis the scariest movie I've ever seen and one of the best not just of the year but ever. 5/5"

","and gave me clinical anxiety. I mean Jesus Christ almighty I don't scare easily I'm a manly man's man but this film was horrifying. I was very worried about it being over-hyped, especially since I've seen enough horror movies that I've gotten to that horrible point where I can tell generally when a scare's coming by the camera angle and the sound cues. It wasn't over-hyped. Nor were the best scares given away in the trailer, in my opinion. Even the ones you do see in the trailer, they spin them or cut them in such a way that it's not quite what you get in the movie, which was really nice. It still caught me off guard. Anyway, I'm going to try to explain as lucidly as possible why this film actively crippled my soul and tried to kill me. This is not a cheap jump-out scare movie. I know a lot of people say that, and you may wonder, ""then what kind of movie is it?"" This movie is a horrible, slow, simmering build-up of suspense to the point where I was praying for the jump scare to come just to break the tension. This movie is physically exhausting and makes you anxious as hell throughout almost the entire thing. It's a long time before you even see the freaky ghost lady and they manage to make it horrifying without her. When the scare does come, it does not last a second and then pass. IT's not a startling thing. No, you see the horrible ghost (great make up effects, by the way), the camera lingers on the ghost for an unsettling amount of time and it somehow doesn't lose any of its shock value, and then there's an extended sequence of said ghost attacking someone or just generally being a ghostly dick that will leave you exhausted by the time the scare passes. I will say the climax and end of the film goes into slightly more well-trod, less frightening territory, but it's not bad at all, just not quite as balls-crushingly horrifying as the first 3/4 of the film. The bottom line is if you have anxiety or a heart condition, are nursing, pregnant, or may become pregnant, you should consult your doctor before seeing this movie. Oh, also the cinematography and the sound and acting was really neat and stuff, even from Lili Taylor, which I'll admit surprised me a little after her horrible stint in the Haunting, which I do not recommend because it sucks"

","This scary movie is the best since the exorcist, I've read the bad reviews and i couldn't help but disagree,<br/><br/>I heard some reviews saying that it had cheap jump scares.

After all that tension has build up, something scary happens, and what happens is not a face popping out of nowhere, its actually something terrifying.<br/><br/>This movie is so intense even at the beginning, while there's something happening downstairs, there's something just as horrible happening upstairs.<br/><br/>And people who gave this review a 1 just because it says ""based on a true story"". Why don't you do your research first so you can find out this movie was based on ""house of darkness, house of light"" which was written after the horrible experience of the Perrons. <br/><br/>This movie has incredibly talented actors, including the little kids. <br/><br/>50% percent of the scares aren't because of loud music, 50% of the scares are due to amazing camera tricks and angles. They seriously couldn't have chosen a scarier angle to show the activity from.<br/><br/>This movie isn't just scary, it also has a good story, it's not a movie about a killer that kills for no reason. It's not a movie that has ghosts terrorizing a family just because.<br/><br/>This movie also doesn't just have doors moving and windows closing until the very ending, this actually has terrifying things in the beginning middle and end.<br/><br/>Only bad thing, the trailers did reveal a bit too much of the scary scenes, so just watch trailer 1!<br/><br/>10/10"

","Great modern horror with it's roots firmly in the 1970's, both in the story's setting and also with it's production style and cinematography - The Conjuring doesn't disappoint. Without going into the plot I will simply say that this is a highly effective ghost story that surpasses it's peers by way of the skillful direction of James Wan and the uniformly excellent cast. We care for the Perron's and want to see them survive this terrifying ordeal and we believe that Ed and Lorraine Warren also care for the frightened family and are willing to do whatever it takes to help them.<br/><br/>The good - The sets, script and actors are all fantastic. The atmosphere starts off creepy and just gradually increases until the climatic final act. Extra marks for the highly effective sound design that heightens the audiences sense of terror during the scares. It was also nice to see a couple of welcome touches of humor offering some much needed light when things threatened to become almost unbearably tense and heavy.<br/><br/>The bad - even though the director teases the audience for almost an hour before showing us anything of the main ghost I still felt that he could have held off a good while longer. Some of the most effective scares in the film involve seeing nothing more than the black shadows behind an ajar door.<br/><br/>It was great seeing and hearing the audiences reaction to this film in the cinema. Once the film started the cinema fell completely silent apart from moments when anxious viewers implored a character to be careful etc. Great stuff. There is at least one unexplored plot thread that would make for a great sequel so here's hoping that Wan signs up for at least one more film."
"hashtagger97","7","0","1","30 July 2013"," Good Movie But....
","When I first heard The Conjuring announced, I wasn't that excited. The plot wasn't something new, and I just was not that excited. James Wan, a good director with movies like ""Saw"" and ""Insidious"", kind of brought my attention to this movie. However, when ""The Conjuring"" came out, it got very good reviews with critics and even better ones from fans. I then got exceptionally more excited for the movie and planned to see it in theaters. I came in waiting for a movie to scare me out of my seats but what disappointed me the most was....the scares themselves. I had watched a couple of trailers for the movie before going to the theaters and the trailers revealed more than half of the scares! It got so bad that I was even calling out the scares before they even came out. It really ruined the movie for me but I didn't let that influence my review. ""The Conjuring"" is a good horror movie don't get me wrong, but its not anything new. Sure it's better than most horror movies coming out now, but it is not as terrifying as most people say it is. My recommendation, watch it, but DO NOT watch any trailers for it. If you did, you're going to be a little disappointed with how much the trailers show."
"Bbenbb","9","0","1","30 July 2013"," A Ghost Story Done Right
","This kind of story has been done many times before. But The Conjuring captures a vital element that most others fail at, something absolutely vital to a horror film. And it does it without excessive swearing, sex, or gore. And that vital element is family relationship. You are immediately wrapped in a by-gone era when siblings are close and parents are doing everything they can to live the American dream. James Wan brilliantly reinforces the warm atmosphere with subtle camera work, pacing, and music. The relationships are put to the test when malevolent forces threaten what they hold most dear.<br/><br/>Powerful writing like this is very rare in films these days. It plays on the paranoia everyone feels at some point, as a child, as a mother, as a father. The acting is magnificent. And the production solid. It all comes together to create a very terrifying experience."

","I gave it a 6 for the acting; I thought Vera Farmiga and a couple of the kids stirred some emotion. Although the movie was supposedly based on a true story, I sort of doubt the accuracy, otherwise this would have been nationwide media material. Regardless, it's just a movie and if they would have had a better sense of fright, something that made you grip your chair and at least say ""wow"" every once in a great while, I may have added one more star. But let's just say for the sake of story telling, I left the theater once again disappointed. I think for the most part, I am satisfied once in 10 movies. The majority of them seem to be geared more toward individual glorification and computerized graphics. Sorry, but that's just who I am. My friends don't care a lot about that side of me, but I am pretty satisfied about my critical demeanor. After all, that one in ten makes me quite satisfied indeed and hopeful that there are still some good writers and directors out there. At this point in the movie industry, I have to say they are doing a pretty lousy job. As far as the money they make, well the viewers are also doing a lousy job in not being critical enough. I went to see The Conjuring based on the score on IMDb. Take it back to a 6 fellas!"

","***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***There's no doubt that The Conjuring is a scary film but what happens throughout most of the film isn't anything we haven't seen before. To me it was like Paranormal Activity and Insidious on steroids. Girls getting dragged out of bed (Paranormal Activity) girl getting lifted in the air by her hair (Paranormal Activity 3) but just more amped up. Ghosts walking around and standing in places (Insidious) and some of the music sounded similar to insidious some of the scares instantly reminded me of even more horror films before and even the possessed woman at the end kind of looked like Regan from the exorcist but the conjuring has some scares that are well placed and the suspense is high throughout the film the scares were terrifying in exception to the cheesy Annabelle doll sequence at the beginning of the film. I thought the film had very good acting and was very well paced. the film was very entertaining to watch and will probably have many people looking more into the story of the warrens and the people that they helped. The Conjuring is a scary film that borrows a lot but doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing. I look forward to seeing the next film in the soon to be franchise but I doubt it will top the original but we will see."

","I'm not normally a fan of horror films because I think I've burned out my ability to feel fear from years of watching horror films. Mostly I watch this genre because it makes me laugh. So, it's not often that I'm scared watching these films but this one scared the living snot out of me! James Wan (director of ""Saw"") made a ghost story/horror film and successfully made it feel real and authentic--and this is coming from a dude who doesn't believe in the supernatural. He magically used light, shadow and sound to create some unbelievable scares that made my hairs stand on end and my heart try to burst out of my chest, leave the theater and hide under my covers on my bed.<br/><br/>Finally, the actors cast really did their jobs tremendously and continued the theme of making the movie feel less like a fictional piece of work and something you were actually watching unfold in front of you (yes, I know it's ""based on a true story"" but in the world of movies, that doesn't always mean non-fiction.) Overall, I was really impressed (and super scared) of this film."
"ksj870","7","0","1","29 July 2013"," A Movie That Conjures Up Nightmares
","So you think you like scary movies? You might want to think again.<br/><br/>The Conjuring, based on the case files of real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, is nothing if not scary. The story of a family haunted by a particularly evil spirit with plans to kill them all, The Conjuring is almost certainly the most horrifying movie that will be released in 2013.<br/><br/>And it is superbly executed on all counts. Director James Wan lets the unfolding nightmare speak for itself, and dispenses with many of the cheap blood and thunder effects often associated with films of its type. In fact, the whole film looks a lot like a documentary, which is appropriate given that it is based on a supposedly true story. The script treats the subject matter with respect, and while I don't know if any of the filmmakers are Christian themselves, the plot retains the inherently Christian worldview underlying the narrative from beginning to end. The cast is superb, particularly Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed Warren, the devoutly Catholic couple who spent much of their adult lives investigating supernatural events and helping those plagued by otherworldly afflictions. In many ways, The Conjuring is perfectly made.<br/><br/>But while I give The Conjuring high marks in every fundamental area of filmmaking, it's still hard for me to recommend it to the general audience without some serious qualifications. As a long-time horror devotee who has watched countless genre films of varying styles and who is always up for a good scare, I have to say that I'm not sure The Conjuring qualifies as a ""good"" scare. It's not a monster movie. It's not a slasher film or really even a ghost story. The ""monster"" in The Conjuring is something far worse than any of that, and the result is a film that isn't merely scary but often genuinely disturbing. The fact that it's based on real-life events and that something at least generally like the movie's plot really could happen makes it all even more terrifying.<br/><br/>Here's a good test. If you've seen The Exorcist and it didn't bother you any more than a typical horror film, then you can probably enjoy The Conjuring. Otherwise, you're probably better advised to spend your money elsewhere.<br/><br/>Again, I'm not saying The Conjuring isn't well done. It is. Not only is it technically well made, but more importantly it actually conveys a strong pro-Christian message, which is increasingly unusual in the movies today. The plot is involving, the characters exceptionally empathetic and at times the film is genuinely moving in a way few films of any genre often achieve. But for all that, it's not really an entertaining movie. It's scary, but it's not very fun. And I think even a ""scary movie"" should be entertaining as well. Let the buyer beware!"

","A demonic entity lays claim to family living in a secluded farmhouse, prompting them to seek the aid of two renowned paranormal researchers in this tale of possession inspired by actual events. The story gets underway as paranormal researchers Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) evaluate a mysterious doll discovered by a trio of young roommates in 1968. Believing their house to be haunted by the wayward spirit of a deceased young girl, they give the girl permission to inhabit the doll, and soon their lives become a waking nightmare. Informed by Ed and Lorraine that they have fallen victim to an inhuman spirit (aka a demon) seeking a human host, the roommates entrust the doll to the Warrens, who place it in their personal museum for safekeeping. Flash forward three years to Harrisville, RI, where the Perron family have just moved into their country dream home -- an 18th century farmhouse that offers plenty of space for parents Carolyn (Lili Taylor) and Roger (Ron Livingston), as well as their five daughters Andrea (Shanley Caswell), Nancy (Hayley McFarland), Christine (Joey King), Cindy (Mackenzie Foy), and April (Kyla Deaver). It seems like the ideal place to raise a family until a series of unsettling events leave the Perron family convinced they are not alone. Terrified, Carolyn reaches out to the Warrens for help, and learns that a demonic entity has attached itself to her family, and has no intentions of letting them go. Meanwhile, the deeper the Warrens delve into the farmhouse's history, the clearer it becomes that this spirit has a murderous agenda, and that no one will be safe until it is driven back into darkness."

","I may as well just cut to the chase...""The Conjuring"" is a great movie. Period. Over the last decade or so, films classified as ""horror"" or ""thrillers"", have relied on a tired premise. Teens find themselves in a spooky area, bad things start to happen, a baddie (demon, crazy guy, undead creature) reveals itself. Hero star survives and defeats baddie, sequel shows up a year later. This film actually puts classic haunting lore back into the big screen, something that has truly not been done since ""Poltergeist"" back in 1982. The film's plot is simple, a family moves to an old farm in the country and finds themselves face to face with paranormal forces. They seek assistance from well known investigators and together they attempt to gain back the family's regular life and control of the home. But along the way, the viewer is treated to strong scares not via crazy special effects, but by simple camera tricks and down right spooky settings and situations. Because of this, one can be made to feel that they are being placed into the scene and encountering the haunting activity themselves, rather than watching gore being splattered via fake acting or computer generation. Fair warning...this is an old fashioned ghost story, meant to deliver scares and thrills by means of accuracy and ghostly reality... if you are a fan of recent ""scary"" films you may be shocked at how effective at delivering the scares this movie truly is. But throw in accurate 70's attire, language, and period scenery, as well as strong story telling, you will be treated to a very good movie!"

Almost immediately, the family begins to experience sinister phenomenon that escalates so violently that they make a desperate plea for help to notable paranormal investigators, Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) and Ed (Patrick Wilson) Warren. Accustomed to dealing malevolent spirit activity, even the Warren's are unprepared for the hostile evil that dwells within the Perron's home.<br/><br/>The Conjuring is a perfect example of how a stale premise can be transformed by quality filmmaking. Director, James Wan, of Saw and Insidious fame, is a master of the genre. Wan goes back to a much more traditional and grounded style of delivering scares, mercifully avoiding overblown CGI.<br/><br/>Another main contributor to the film's success is the intelligent screenplay by Chad and Carey Hayes, whom treat the material with the same respect as one might a great drama. There's not one superfluous scene in The Conjuring as the tension unrelentingly builds throughout.<br/><br/>Adding further weight to the project is the stellar cast. Livingston and Taylor have long been amongst the most under-appreciated actors around and are always welcome screen presences thanks to their amazing versatility. Wilson and Farmiga are flawless as the Warren's. Both are the type of performer that elevates whatever project they're in and it's indisputable that the actors make what would have always been a good film great.<br/><br/>With a look, tone and quality reminiscent of the all time great horror flicks, The Conjuring is one of the best surprises of the year.<br/><br/>http://infilmandtvland.wordpress.com/"

The exposition was rushed to the point where I don't even know why they bothered. Wan devoted about 3 minutes to explaining why everything was happening, but that was also the worst part of the movie so I'm glad we didn't waste too much time on it. It was pretty standard anyway. <br/><br/>The scares were good. Wan has finally perfected the craft after a few mis-fires. Everyone in my theater looked sufficiently frightened.

The story is old, but it is a good story so I don't mind being told it again. <br/><br/>Spoiler Maybe: Villain tropes are a pet peeve of mine, so others might not find this so troubling, but witches and satanists are not evil and shouldn't automatically be the bad guy. The Christian religious message was really heavy-handed and gets pretty annoying for non-believers. I imagine it would be downright uncomfortable for actual witches and satanists. They go out of their way to get the Catholic prayers right, but blunder through alternative religions without even looking at the Wikipedia page.

"scokno","8","0","1","27 July 2013"," A Modern Horror Classic
","Horror films have gotten a tough break lately with lazy directors, lackluster scripts, and mind-numbing plots. When said horror films are R rated, that usually means they are equipped with nudity, language, gore, and usually on unnecessary levels. James Wan, who directed modern horror classic Saw (not the crappy and countless sequels), brings a refreshing turn in horror films with The Conjuring, where its R rating is based solely on the scares. Atmospheric and haunting, the film boasts a clever twist on a familiar story and top notch performances.<br/><br/>Based on true events, The Conjuring tells of Ed and Lorraine Warren's most frightening paranormal experience. The Warrens are known for their work as demonologists and paranormal experts, as seen in their work on other pop culture phenomenon like the Amityville, NY case, which led to the classic The Amityville Horror. Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as the Warrens and bring a sense of realness to a couple who have been mocked over the years. After speaking at a Massachusetts university, the Warrens meet Carolyn Perron (the fantastic Lili Taylor), a mother who is concerned with events occurring in her home. Foul smells. Strange noises. Bruises appearing from nothing. Ghostly sightings. Though reluctant, the Warrens visit the Perron home, only to find that the house is indeed haunted by a very mad being who wants the Perron family dead.<br/><br/>The story is, in itself, not that original. A haunted house. A scared family. Crazy happenings. But, it's the way the story is told that sets it apart. Wan has a great way of piecing together an interesting story and allowing even the slowest moments to keep us on the edge of our seat.<br/><br/>Each moment lends itself to going one of two ways: harp on cheesy/easy scare tactics or build on a growing, atmospheric fear and allow the creepy feelings to permeate. This works as it's a decent amount of time before we even see a portion of an entity. Where Spielberg made Jaws scary by not really seeing the monster at first and The Others freaked us out by ripping out a crazy twist no one saw coming, The Conjuring doesn't expect you to pretend you don't know the story. It allows you to fear what you're expecting by not really being able to see anything. If only more horror filmmakers took this device.<br/><br/>While the R rating is a little reaching since the bits of violence and gore are so minimal it should've received a hard PG-13, the film does provide quite a few jumps and leaves one feeling pretty creepy for hours after. It's the kind of scary film you see when you're a kid and it sticks with you forever.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a cheeky, fluff horror film, go see The Purge with the middle schoolers who have snuck in there. If you're looking for gore at its finest, check out the remake of Evil Dead. If you're looking for a smart, thought-provoking thrill, then The Conjuring is the film for you."

I recommend the movie, but watching it in the right environment makes all the difference in the world."
"Jac23443","8","0","2","27 July 2013"," An Exquisite Horror Masterpiece! I mean it... it's a MASTERPIECE!
","Ingenuity is a word that has sort of strayed away from the horror genre and I have to say The Conjuring gives me hope. In my opinion James Wan has created a masterpiece. This movie is genius in its construction, the way it was devised from the moment it begins towards the second the credits begin to roll at the end. It was well paced, intricately and elaborately shot (upside down shot of Christine who thinks she sees a man by the door), and I mean seriously incredibly shot. This movie honestly gave me the feel of a seventies classic, if you've seen Carrie, A Nightmare on Elm Street, or Suspiria then you'd understand what I mean. The plot is well constructed, you have the move in, the occurrences of ghosts, the search for a plausible explanation, then the search for the help that inevitably ends up being ghost hunters with a past of an exorcism gone wrong <-- Which by the way was perfect for an internal character conflict because I don't think it's been done since the Exorcist 1973 and that horrible conflict happened at the end when the priest died. All of the incidents with the entities were original and were never seen coming, at all, complete and under jump scares that were actually scary. The fact that the movie was given it's rated R on the sole fact of horror is incredible. If you are looking for a movie worth watching, honestly and sincerely watch this, it's more than worth the money because it is actually terrifying! It's not a cheap knock off horror/comedy like Cabin in the Woods."

","I'm not gonna lie and say that I'm experienced in the field of scary movies. To be honest this is only my tenth horror film and my first in a cinema. I walked into the theater with my friend, both about to pass out with terror and walked out of the theater with that fuzzy feeling we all know and love after a good movie. Set in the 70's, a family of seven moves in to a house that is haunted by the demon placed there by a suicidal witch. After a series of haunting events, they call upon a tormented couple that busts these demons for a living. The CGI special effects were incredible, but lets not forget the effect of the human mind to scare itself. Every creak was a demon, every open window was a mirror to the ghost world. I may be new to this genre but this movie is worth every 10 it receives."

","After reading so many good reviews, I had to see this film. I love the horror genre but there aren't too many that actually scare me, but with The Conjuring, there was no shortage of terror. The whole movie kept me on the edge of my seat. I thought that the cinematography and direction was superb, and the acting was great as well. I think what makes this movie even more intense is that the characters are actually like-able, as most characters in horror movies have few to no redeeming qualities and there's no emotional connection so you don't care if they live or die. Another thing I must touch on is the cinematography and direction. As I mentioned earlier, both were superb. I am a huge fan of James Wan's previous films (though I don't think Dead Silence was very good) and I really can see him being one of the great masters of the horror genre, because he nailed it in this film, he nailed it in ""Insidious,"" and the first ""Saw"" film was great as well. The cinematography really pulled you into the 1970's. Overall, I would say this film will haunt you long after you leave the theatre."

"HeugeneB","Null","0","1","24 July 2013"," My Four Favorite Haunted Films
","THE CONJURING, after a slow start provided an excellent thrill ride. It had evocative music and sound effects, intense acting, and enough lulls, comic or quiet, for breathing space. That said, I nominate four films that defined the genre for me: The original THE THING (from another world) which I saw as a child made me move to the back of the theater. THE HAUNTING had incredible performances, particularly from Julie Harris and Clair Bloom. Filmed with great style and sinister flourish by director Robert Wise, it made a creaking, bulging door, swooshes of chill, a child's frightened whimper behind a wall and the suggestion of a dead hand clutching Julie Harris's into shivering tension. THE INNOCENTS, based on Henry James' own creepy story, THE TURN OF THE SCREW, had Deborah Kerr's incredible acting as an infernal meddler and self-appointed guardian angel. In trying to save two innocent but tainted children she manages to cause a breakdown in the girl and the death of the boy. It has in several brief scenes the best depictions of the living dead I've ever seen. The very real former governess is spine-chilling. Dressed in funereal black and hanging in the reeds, she stares from a distance across a swampy lake at the little girl (but only Deborah Kerr sees her). Finally, the best from a true master, Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO. Starting with Bernard Herrman's incredible score, from deceptive but sinister moodiness to shrieking violins, it builds to an escalating tension. Anthony Perkins--playing a deceptively sweet, stuttering Mama's boy-- gives us creepy duets with Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, and John Gavin building a sense of foreboding that shoves us all down those cellar stairs to meet the monstrous stuffed matriarchal owl rocking in her chair. And not one Oscar! Shame on the Academy,"

","I had seen the trailer and loved it but nothing prepared me for what I saw on screen, My wife says the only movie to ever get under her skin was The Exorcist and I suspect that one goes for a lot of people I saw The Exorcist for the first time in my late teens and it didn't have that shock value to me that others felt when seeing it much younger, back to The Conjuring which now has become officially the only other movie to scare the hell out of my wife, I'm much more hardened when it comes to Horror movies but I got to tell you that I had shallow breathing at times and even had sweaty palms I loved every minute of it, A Horror movie done right, the based on a true story label in movies almost always results in the makers screwing it up for sure, well this time they pulled off a masterpiece of a Horror movie, I wont touch the subject of how accurate the film was based on the actual events that happened because I don't know, the book (which I have not read) seems to suggest this all actually happened, & that scares the crap outa me, If you don't handle tension well stay away, if anything that has to do with Demonic Possession & Exorcism scares you then stay away because we get a Ghost Haunting/Demonic Possession Movie that will not give you a breather, you will leave the theater spent, also I had no idea this Movie was Rated R, no Vulgar Language but they got the Rating for disturbing images. & the Possession scene is very intense. I suspect this movie will be playing at the theaters for 2 months or more & go on to make more money than any other this year and for good reason. ""A solid 10 Stars"""
"jpenera","8","0","1","24 July 2013"," Heartwarming tale of terror!
","In spite of the trailers and the ""horror"" hype built around this movie, the movie does have a heartwarming end. Good triumphs over evil -- something that is so lacking and so much needed for our times today. What is so powerful about this movie is that it is based on a true story. You have to watch till the very end, during the credits, and you'll see all the documentary texts and photographs referencing the actual event. Very impressive. The movie itself is brilliantly crafted. I saw Patrick Wilson in ""Insidious"". But this time he, in this movie, does not spook as much. He plays a very believable lay Catholic demonologist. The rest of the cast, needless to say, performed par excellence. Who can forget Lilli Taylor in ""Ransom""? Or Vera Farmiga in ""Source Code""? And here they all are knitted as one stunning ensemble of true artists. Yes, the movie ""The Exorcist"" will come to mind. But the difference is that in the ""Exorcist"" the battle is against Satan himself. In this movie, it is subtly against the same ancient enemy but disguised as hateful entities or souls that have possessed items or latched into persons or things. Both terrify, horrify and even paralyze. But in this movie, you leave feeling good. Add to that the superb music that was just right."

","My first review because I had to. I watch a lot of horror movies and enjoy all of the genre - paranormal, slasher, found footage...etc but mostly enjoy the paranormal/possession types. I found the Conjuring to be the complete horror movie without a weakness. It was brilliant and every horror movie fan should see it as it might be the best of all time. Great acting, good storyline, excellent scares and unlike most horror movies, they didn't botch the ending. Also, unlike in many other movies where the scariest scenes are shown in the previews, it is not the case here. I can't wait to own it on DVD and watch it again and again. Good luck sleeping at night!"
"FilmMuscle","7","0","1","23 July 2013"," Another Traditional Haunted-House Story
","From the man who brought you Saw and Insidious, The Conjuring casts you into a familiar setting- one that revolves around a haunted house, a terrified family, and some experienced veterans in this paranormal field. What follows is an incredibly tense and frightening ride through a traditional haunted-house story. The film's major highlight is its effective use of jump-scares and placing you into that seat of hopelessness and the unknown of what's to come next, and I have to say that the cinematography is terrific. <br/><br/>Horror movies, in general, really have to rely on cameras to deliver the scariest experience to their audience from focusing on aghast faces to subtle placements of certain items. Anyways, The Conjuring's overall look proves how much more stupendous a film camera is over a digital one, but that's beside the point. This film greatly depends on jump- scares to affright its watchers, and it accomplishes just that as I found countless individuals in the room screaming, gasping, and holding on to their friends in anticipation of what awaits. Admittedly, there were numerous sequences that had me holding onto my chair, shocked at what just transpired and hoping for that particular character to escape unharmed. Rightfully so, the film takes a while to get to the problem of it all as it takes its time building up its characters (there are actually two branching perspectives) and the issue that's arising within the house, and as usual in most horror films, the buildup is much more entertaining and daunting than its climax. <br/><br/>On top of the scares, the Conjuring also benefits from its strong acting performances from the likes of Vera Farmiga to Patrick Wilson to even the kids (yes, usually the kids in horror films are horrible actors, but this time, they're extremely believable). The chemistry between Lorraine Warren (Vera Farmiga) and Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) is quite evident, and the other family delivers as well. Whenever the kids are endangered, you're dramatically concerned. <br/><br/>Then, there's the script, which is satisfying in some parts and underwhelming in others. The greatest element that The Conjuring suffers from is its too-familiar ""everything""- from the setting to the characters to the story and its progression. The film contains almost every single clichÃ© that most haunted-house movies are riddled with. At times, a specific scene feels utterly cheesy and slightly lackluster due to the fact that we've heard these characters saying these exact lines and performing these exact actions in other movies to the point where it feels predictable and unbelievable, ruining the immersion level in the meantime. <br/><br/>It's also a little hilarious that after so many haunted stories, yet another family foolishly decides to move into an obviously creepy home that sees its floors constantly creak and its basement scream ""do not come down here!"" The home is old and messy, and there's a freakish tree resting right in the front-yard. How can you not be suspicious right from the get-go?! In fact, during the first half of the film, I wondered why James Wan chose to direct this picture when it's so similar to Insidious. At the moment, haunted-house movies are a fad that should finally be stopped because at this point, no matter how horrifying said movie is, the film will lose points because of its traditional and uninspired route. <br/><br/>The music was okay, but at times, it was just more of the same generic horror music that you've heard in almost every single haunted- house movie before it, but then when that bass kicks in, your feet start tapping against the floor and your hands begin shaking. In the end, The Conjuring shocks you and disturbs you while you're in that theater room, but after you leave, you're likely to forget the ending and perhaps confuse the film with another one when it's brought up in a conversation. Simply put, if you're looking for a new horror film with an interesting concept and a memorable, unique experience, The Conjuring is not the place to look, but since there's a shortage of decent horror flicks recently, it'd be nice to actually witness an effectively scary one for a change. In that case, you can't go wrong with The Conjuring. If half of my theater screamed like a group of little girls, chances are you might to."
"gemini_dremz","10","0","2","23 July 2013"," A Must See!
","I saw this film today and it brought me back to my own childhood. I would've been 7 yrs. old in 1971 and I have to say I was impressed with everything the film offered to make it feel like it was the 70's; from the clothing, hair styles, paranormal equipment, cars, house decor even down to the coffee cups, I remember all of those things just as they were. <br/><br/>Now about the film itself, the acting was phenomenal, especially Lili Taylor's role; that had to be tough, but she pulled it off just as she did in The Addiction in 1995 (if you've not seen it, please do, it also cast Edie Falco and Michael Imperioli). Vera's always great to watch and I was happy to see Ron Livingston as Roger Perron (I always think of him in Office Space). The entire cast was so believable.<br/><br/>One would think ""here's another movie about demonic possession"", but it's really not. In fact, it's quite frightening when you think of the possibilities. Yes, it's based on a true story and as with all films based on true stories, it's got the Hollywood touch. The FX were amazingly real; shockingly real. I like that for once there was a horror movie without sex, nudity, foul language and lots of gore, in fact, the only other horror film I believe to have been made without all that was The Omen with Gregory Peck (another favorite of mine).<br/><br/>There were parts that really scared me, but the entire story is just creepy and I think that's what makes it so scary, not gore, but the premise itself. I would highly recommend this film even if you're not a fan of horror films. I think it's one I'll have to add to my DVD collection in the near future!!!!"
"Michael-Hallows-Eve","10","0","2","23 July 2013"," A truly great scary horror classic in years to come.
","Okay, this movie was one of the best new horror films of its time to date in my opinion. It has all the tension and build up of the old school ""scary"" horror films, the atmosphere throughout has you perched on the edge of your seat, and you know something is going to happen but when it does it still takes you by surprise. James Wan out did himself here, his other films (DEAD SILENCE, SAW, INSIDIOUS), although great horror films as well, are trumped by this masterpiece of tension and fright. I heard news that he may be heading away from horror films, if so it would be a huge loss to the genre. This film reminded of the good old 70's horror films, slow tension build up, setting the movie up for the main story, then hitting you hard with a sensory overload of pure visual fright and delight in the final stanza. I've seen thousands of movies in my lifetime, and I've had some good scares while watching them (some of the for-mentioned films to name a few), but this movie had me jumping for the first time in years! I left the theater with my girlfriend, and we both said that we couldn't remember another possession film that scared us like that since THE EXORCIST. We were in our seats at the back of the theater and when the scary scenes happened the people in front of us jumped so hard the seats moved. People were turning away and screaming, I haven't seen that happen in years at a horror movie. This is one movie that I'd be happy to see again and again. I think it will go down as one of those films that people will talk about for years (just my opinion though). So I give this the 9.5 out of 10 it deserves."

","Yet another excellent scary movie from james Wan. I truly do trust this man's style for horror. Like Insidious this film is high on scares and awkward thrills to keep you on the edge of your seat. My opinion with watching scary movies though is pretty much its gotta be at home to be scary. So due to whispers and popcorn chewing I didn't find myself scared watching this but im positive i wouldve been at home in the dark and silence. There is a lot to be terrified about here. The film builds up perfectly to me, I think the current formula of the slow build up to the real terror works well to help keep you nervous. I really enjoyed this film and look forward to experiencing the terror again on blu ray."

","Horror movies are rarely made well these days... let alone this well. James Wan has finally made his true Masterpiece. After making the original ""Saw"", he ventured off to make a gritty action movie and the underrated ""Dead Silence"". Then came ""Insidious"" in 2010. A more suspenseful movie with a better execution. It's like ""Saw"", ""Dead Silence"", and ""Insidious"" were all practice shots for a much bigger and better movie. <br/><br/>""The Conjuring"" is supposedly based on true accounts from paranormal investigators ""The Warrens"". Whether or not anything in this film is true is truly irrelevant to me, because I don't get caught up in the Hollywood gimmick of ""Based on a True Story"". The movie alone captures real terror all on it's own. From bumps in the night, to horrid faces, creepy dolls (A constant in Wan's films), shadowy figures and straight up exorcisms... This film has it all. <br/><br/>The theater was going nuts throughout the film. This movie, based on language, sexual content and blood and gore could have easily been rated PG-13, but it's rated R, simply because it's that scary."

Its a carefully crafted horror thriller. One should be careful if he/she has a light heart. It may haunt your life. The music - sound effects, the camera angle, the shots and the story is so well conceived, that one should get the full satisfaction of watching it on big screen.

","The Conjuring review<br/><br/>Can I get a popcorn, some skittles and a change of pants please?! You will need a fresh pair coming out of the theater after watching The Conjuring. Directed by James Wan (Saw, Insidious) hits the nail on the head for the genre. The scares start right in the beginning and do not let up until the very end, so scary you will be clutching the stranger next to you. Patrick Wilson (Watchmen, Insidious) and Vera Farmiga (Bates Motel) play as world renowned paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. They set out to prove or disprove haunting, demonic possession, ghosts, etc. They are led to a case involving the Perron family, played by Ron Livingston (Office Space) and Lili Taylor (Six Feet Under), whose farmhouse is being terrorized by a dark presence. The Warrens are brought in to determine whether the dark presence constitutes an exorcism. What ensues after they reach the house is pure evil, genuine horror, edge of your seat kind of terror. Mind you, this is all based on true events! There's no spinning heads or Split Pea soup projectile vomit but make no mistake The Conjuring serves up its fair share of bone chilling terror, including a cameo from a possessed Kid Sister doll. The direction, the cinematography and the acting are all superb! Of course there are the non scary moments, like in all horror movies, that tease a scare out of you, but overall The Conjuring is not to be missed! Hell, The Germ and The Jew drove half an hour to see it! We rate this one on the highest of standards when it comes to horror! Germer's and Jewette's don't forget to read, like and share us!"

"biochemist","10","0","2","22 July 2013"," The Conjuring is a great film!
","I just came back from viewing The Conjuring. It is a fantastic horror movie. Here's why...<br/><br/>Director James Wan (along with his team of writers), are not afraid to take it back to basics. Back to a day when those things that go ""bump"" in the night actually scared you. The shadows. The unexplained noises in the dark. The creaky doors that open on their own. Objects that are moved or fall off the walls. All of which are elements of true horror movies.<br/><br/>It seems that these days the kids want senseless gore, blood and porn in horror movies. But to me, that's not true horror. James Wan & Co. decided to not ""Hollywoodize"" this film and let the story and events creep you out. I had friends watch it opening night with an audience that laughed, full of teens of course. To me, that's a big distraction to fully take in and appreciate the dialog, atmosphere, cinematography and soundtrack, all of which are genius. I always choose the late screenings to avoid the annoying texting teens and chatty Kathy's. And boy am i glad i did.<br/><br/>There are a handful of horror movie classics that have elements i love, such as the under lighting of people casting weird shadows in 'Rosemary's Baby'. Or the same lighting, but the sounds and creepy shadowy atmosphere of 'The Exorcist'. Or the little tricks Mr. Wan enjoys such as the Flashbulbs used by paranormal investigators. But most importantly, it's the lack of CG creatures, monsters, cheesy special effects.<br/><br/>Mr. Wan instead chooses great actors to execute great scripts. And in that process, the characters become believable, the story becomes believable... and it all becomes creepy to the nth degree. Filmmakers should take note and make movies like this... better horror movies where less is actually more. And that is what i love about this film. It kept me still in my seat with an uneasy feeling from the opening shot until the very end. Excellent writing and directing along with a great cast of excellent actors. I highly recommend this movie. After you watch it, and only after you watch it, i recommend looking up the real people involved and the story which inspired this film of true events.<br/><br/>***** 5 out of 5 Stars!!!!"
"Toronto85","8","0","2","21 July 2013"," The Conjuring
","It's possession galore for the Perron family in ""The Conjuring"". The film for the most part takes place in 1971 and that's we meet the Perrons, a nice all American type family with a couple and their five daughters. They move into a house which is basically possessed and is haunted. It's all okay at first until the family dog dies, and then some doors start opening on their own, and finally some of the teenage daughters begin to feel a demonic presence in the house at night trying to get at them. They call the Ed and Lorraine Warren for help, a couple who investigate paranormal activity. Eventually we discover some history of the people who lived in that house over the years, and the terrible things that went on in the house. Can the investigators save the Perron family from being possessed completely, or will it all end in tragedy?<br/><br/>'The Conjuring' is a chilling horror movie, and it uses many different things then what we are used to seeing in recent horror flicks. Mirrors and shadowy figures and creaking doors opening are used to create fright, instead of blood and guts and over the top jump scares. Great direction by James Wan, this film had a 'Dead Silence' feel to it (that was also directed by Wan). I liked the background story of the people who lived in the house before, although I wish it would've been explored more. <br/><br/>What I didn't like about this was the exorcism parts. I just felt like it was sort of ripping off of 'The Exorcist', and it fell a bit flat and was a little silly. Any demonic possession movie will get that comparison. The special effects and make up for it was well done though! Acting was good all around, in particular from Vera Farmiga and Lili Taylor. 'The Conjuring' is basically 'The Amityville Horror' meets 'The Exorcist', with a few more scares. Some of the scenes late at night with the kids being basically stalked by the ghosts were genuinely scary, I thought it was really well done. I'd check this out!<br/><br/>8/10"

The director had great ideas and he should have stretched out a few of the scenes a bit longer, because some of them happened too fast. If the scenes were longer I don't think it would make the movie boring. I just felt that some of the horror and gore was done in a hurry and there could have been more time dedicated to more of the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>I am happy to see that someone finally made an R rated horror movie that didn't have to get there by using nudity & sex. Don't get me wrong, I love me some naked girls in movies but a truly scary movie has it's work cut out for it to become an R rated movie.<br/><br/>Some of the horror scenes in the movie were funny to me. The exorcism went by too quick, it definitely could have been a few minutes longer to make me feel a little uncomfortable about it, I love the messed up feeling I get after watching a warped movie.<br/><br/>The marketing done for this movie was too strong and lead me to expect more than what was in the actual commercials, they could have held back and still sold it just fine. I don't think I got ripped off by going to see it in the theatre but I would have been happy to watch this film on DVD."
"dfranzen70","9","0","2","21 July 2013"," Ain't nothing holy 'bout it - terrifying
","The Conjuring is a blood curdling treat, if you're into movies that spook the bejeezus out of you. Fast-moving, tense, and dark, this is not one of those laughable underwritten suspense movies with more special effects than actual plot. It's the kind of movie that slowly builds for a half hour or so before figuratively unleashing itself upon its audience. <br/><br/>In the same vein as 1979's The Amityville Horror, a family moves into an old farmhouse in Harrisville, Rhode Island. It's 1971. People have porkchop sideburns and wear loud pants. Roger Perron (Ron Livingston) and Carolyn Perron (Lili Taylor) have five - count 'em, five - daughters and a dog. The house was cheap. It didn't take long for the family to find out they picked the wrong farmhouse to inhabit. Yep, you guessed it, malevolent spirits. <br/><br/>Legs are literally pulled in the middle of the night. A smell not unlike rotten eggs comes and goes. Various pieces of furniture, left behind by previous owners, shake and rattle. There's a boarded-up basement. An old music box is found by an even older tree by a deceptively tranquil stream. Pictures fall. Everyone, particularly the kids, is terrified.<br/><br/>Desperate for help, Carolyn contacts the Warrens, Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga). Ed is a demonologist - yes - and Lorraine is a clairvoyant. As soon as they step over the threshold of the Perron house, Lorraine sees a presence, and she and Ed, both veterans of investigating the paranormal, are soon faced with the most treacherous, beguiling case of their lives.<br/><br/>The framework of the movie is that of a traditional haunted-house story, with the terror turned up past 11. That's because - no spoiler here - there are multiple spirits about, although they share a common ancestor, spiritually speaking. Roger and Carolyn are helpless, which we expect; Ed and Lorraine are as well, which we do not. Also, poor Lorraine has already suffered tremendous emotional trauma from previous investigations. Even if and when the investigators can determine the root of the Perrons' problem, they may not be sufficiently equipped to deal with them, even with their cameras, infrared devices, temperature sensors, and the help of assistant Drew and police officer Brad.<br/><br/>This movie is terrifying. Director James Wan is an expert at manipulating light and sound to heighten our sense of dread and fear. When Carolyn descends into the cellar, we descend with her, our hearts palpitating like a lawnmower. Both Ed and Carolyn are inherently relatable, as are their five daughters. Who hasn't played a game like Hide and Clap? (It's sort of like Blind Man's Bluff or Marco Polo, on land.) This is definitely one of the scariest movies of the year, and thankfully it wasn't released in 3D. There are long tracking shots that will exhaust and exhilarate; off-camera noises sound closer and closer with each pressing, bottled-up moment. <br/><br/>There is very little blood, but don't be fooled into thinking this is a harmless movie for kids, either. Whereas The Amityville Horror was almost cartoonish - bleeding walls? - The Conjuring relies most heavily on the human psyche for its fright attack. And it is very, very successful at scaring one almost breathless. There are a lot of things to love about this movie, from its creepy atmosphere juxtaposed with its all-American family to the evocative acting by all of the principals, particularly Farmiga and Taylor, for whom this is her best role to date. No character feels generic or ill-formed, and the intricate, tortuous plot is complex without being complicated. This is a movie to see."

","Director James Wan once again brings us another amazing horror/thriller film and proves he is still one of the best horror directors of the last decade plus. His style of film making brings the best out in the actors and the best out in the stories that surround him.<br/><br/>More recently over the last five years or so horror films have generally been in the Paranormal Activity found footage mold where they lure you in and scare you with consistent jump scares. Director James Wan has never been a director who relies on those types of scares throughout a film. He build up a good story and lets it play out to bring the scares to you. With that type of style James Wan brings much deserved acting to the screen. We generally get no name actors or actresses who can't act at all. In this film Vera Farmiga, Patrick Wilson, Ron Livingston, and Lili Taylor all work so well together it adds a lot to the film. They make you believe what is happening to them seem quite and in turn makes the scares even more intense. With a good secondary cast as well this film overall in the acting department adds something that is usually missing from these types of films.<br/><br/>The writing was actually very good as well especially when you consider writers Chad Hayes and Carey Hayes have up until this point only wrote second rate films that aren't nearly as good. The film is loosely based on Ed and Lorranie Warren. And they do a very good job adapting the film to the big screen. However with a runtime of roughly a hour and forty five minutes(without credits) the film does tend to slow down here and there. Nothing that takes away from the film too much but it is noticeable.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is fantastic in this film. Director James Wan doesn't usually doesn't disappoint in this part of the filming process as this is the same man who who brought the famous theme to the Saw franchise. The soundtrack in the film will leave you with chills and truly does add to the thrills of the film.<br/><br/>Overall this is truly one of the better horror films to be released in recent years. Director James Wan and the amazing cast makes this well worth the viewing price. Expect good thrills that will last with you long after the film goes to black."
"metalrage666","8","0","1","21 July 2013"," What Paranormal Activity should have been.
","There are basically 2 types of horror movie; those that rely on lots of blood and gore and those that rely on the simple fact that all of us are still afraid of what we can't see and don't understand.<br/><br/>The Conjuring delivers us those latter fears in spades. This is the first genuinely freaky modern horror film since Insidious, where it's all about fears that are almost impossible to control and forces that are totally impossible to control.<br/><br/>The story starts as an introduction to Ed and Lorraine Warren as paranormal investigators who help people either explain strange occurrences within their homes or debunk assumed spectral activity as nothing more than creaking floors and rattling pipes. They tour various universities giving lectures on their experiences and showing footage of exorcisms they have been involved in and footage of them explaining the otherworldly forces that manifest themselves in everyday objects such as a scary looking doll etc.<br/><br/>We are then introduced to the Perron family, whom the main story is structured around. The family moves in to a new, yet somewhat rundown, two storey farmhouse in Rhode Island in 1971. Reminiscent of other earlier horror movies abound, such as Poltergeist, Amityville Horror or the Exorcist, when strange yet seemingly coincidental or easily dismissed incidents occur, such as the clocks all stopping at the same time, strange offensive odours or the family dog refusing to enter the home and then suddenly dying overnight.<br/><br/>As time goes on incidents become more and more frequent and more eerie. The mother wakes up each morning with new bruises on various parts of her body, the youngest of the 5 daughters ends up having what is at first an imaginary friend that can only be seen in the reflection of a mirror on an old toy, right up to sudden and freaky events such as hanging pictures being torn from the wall and people being locked in rooms etc.<br/><br/>Eventually the mother tracks down the Warrens during one of their lectures and convinces them to come to her home to help them find out what is happening to their family. Needless to say that with the inclusion of paranormal investigators now on the scene, the entity is none too happy about it, so events start to escalate and finally come to a dramatic conclusion once they realise that the mother has become the conduit for the malevolent spirit.<br/><br/>Fans of spooky movies will see nothing new in the Conjuring that they haven't seen in countless other movies of this genre. People being dragged across the floor by their hair, tons of photographic and light sensitive equipment, demonic possession, sudden apparitions, witches curses etc. have all been done before in Poltergeist, Rose Red, Haunting in Connecticut, Paranormal Activity, Insidious and countless others; so what makes The Conjuring worth seeing? The fact that no matter how many times you see a movie like this or how many times you simply know that something is coming, that sharp jolt of instant darkness or helplessness when facing forces that are out to get you and the adrenaline rush it gives a movie goer is why so many people love a good ghost/demon story.<br/><br/>There is very little CGI in the conjuring and it appears that they have gone for proper special effects with effective use of shadow and atmosphere to create something that you don't often see in horror movies these days. The Conjuring is not overly flashy with exceptional effects but gives a definite feeling of dread and it shows that things that go bump in the night can still scare the hell out of you."
"StevePulaski","8","0","2","21 July 2013"," A wonderful film that reminds us of the building blocks of horror filmmaking
","In a way, director James Wan has evolved as a horror filmmaker for the better. His first effort in the field was the torture porn flick Saw, a mostly solid, amiable effort. His followups were the equally tense films Dead Silence and Insidious (whose sequel-trailer precedes The Conjuring), and now, has evolved as a filmmaker who articulates tension and buildup beautifully with The Conjuring, a taut display of creepy horror cinema.<br/><br/>The plot: Carolyn and Roger Perron (Lili Taylor and Ron Livingston) and their five daughters move into an old decrepit farmhouse in the middle of nowhere and begin to experience the a string of paranormal activity in the house. The clocks all specifically freeze at 3:07am, a music box one of the daughters plays with has her claiming she can see a boy named ""Rori"" when it finishes playing music, and odd smells and physical abuse come about from what appears to be paranormal entities, as well.<br/><br/>Helpless and after the haunting seems to cause mental harm to the children, Carolyn and Roger seek out the help of Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Famiga), two paranormal investigators that try to piece together what, if anything, is haunting the Perron farmhouse and how the ""inhuman spirits"" came about.<br/><br/>The Conjuring's plot is obviously sickeningly familiar and horribly unoriginal. However, despite the overused and questionable 'based on a true story' that the film states early-on, it works largely in part because it tries to make the events here believable and not real. The film itself is meant to serve as something of a retelling of true events - not the actual thing. When watching a sequel to Paranormal Activity, which is passed off as real and not a work of fiction, you find yourself asking, ""how is this real?"" When watching this film, which is passed off as realistic, you find yourself asking, ""how is this not real?"" This is largely thanks to James Wan's studious camera framing and John R. Leonetti's wonderfully creepy, seventies-style cinematography. It's difficult to make a modern home scary, but one from the seventies, featuring eerie knick-knacks, odd wallpaper, strange little porcelain dolls, and a load of dark places is inherently creepy in its oldness. The film features the wonderful ""slowburn"" technique, which will likely take criticism because The Conjuring's agenda doesn't call for anything to be rushed. At one-hundred and twelve minutes, it has just enough time in the beginning to show you the atmosphere of the rural area where the farmhouse resides and takes the time to build tension effectively.<br/><br/>Usually the last thing I find myself discussing when reviewing horror films is the acting, but the naturalistic acting of everyone here must be formally mentioned. Patrick Wilson and Vera Famiga (who always seems to take front-and-center in several contemporary horror films) works wonders as two demonologists, who will inevitably become victim to the Perron haunting as well as trying to be the ones remedying the effects. Ron Livingston has been spectacular in the several film roles he has taken in the last few years, and this one here is no exception, and Lili Taylor takes the cake here as the strongest performance, as he simply tries to be the caring and compassionate mother when the uncertain is taking effect.<br/><br/>The Conjuring takes the personality a lot of Hammer Horror Films do, which are, what have now been called, ""classic horror films"" that emphasized tension and atmosphere over blood and quickly-paced action. The closest thing I've seen to The Conjuring in the last year or so was probably the forgotten but memorable Woman in Black, which was largely a movie about Daniel Radcliffe roaming a house full of eerie decorations and cobwebs. It was a creepy, tonally effective picture and that's just what The Conjuring is.<br/><br/>Not everything works here as well as you'd expect. The development gets a little predictable and the ending seems to cave too much into mainstream expectations. However, this is still a wonderful change-of-pace for contemporary horror, especially being a summer release, when, if anything, the most serious horror films come out in the early months of the year. If anything, The Conjuring reminds us what the fundamental principles of horror filmmaking are, it's that the environment is everything and that forgoing that thought for lame, contrived scenes of slaughter, exorcism, or mindless drivel is an act of genre-blasphemy.<br/><br/>Starring: Patrick Wilson, Vera Famiga, Lili Taylor, and Ron Livingston. Directed by: James Wan."

","I saw this movie the day before opening day. i think this movie was very well done. The whole cast did an awesome job. To me the movie wasn't to scary to make me jump in my seat, but it takes a lot for a movie to get me to jump LOL.. Although I did jump in the beginning because the girl next to me screamed so loud and I wasn't expecting that LOL. I do know if a haunting like that happened to me in real life I would scream like a little girl LOL. Love the fact its Based on a True Story. <br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone. It's a must see movie if your into the paranormal. I give this movie a 10/10. I will definitely be going to see it again.<br/><br/>CLAP! CLAP!"
"samgreer-694-680740","7","0","1","20 July 2013"," Sinister + Paranormal = The Conjuring
","First the good. The movie is scary. There is little in the way of psychological thrills and chills (which is my favorite, think ""Evil Things"" for a fantastic example) but lots of shocks, jumps and BOO! moments that give you that jolt of adrenaline fear we scary movie lovers desire. Visuals are pretty darn disturbing, WELL DONE, and scary, too.<br/><br/>The not so good. The reason this only gets a 7 is it's a formula. Its Sinister + Paranormal with some parts taken directly from each film. Its a lot of haunted house clichés right back to Amityville Horror. It has a slight hole in the plot (the experts arrive to inform the terrorized family the spooky entity is attached to them, not the property - even though their research indicates the spook is strictly concerned with the property) Of course the terrorized family WON'T leave the house...etc.<br/><br/>If this had been an original story with more and well established psychological thrills, minus every haunted house cliché, this film would be an easy 8 or 9 and possibly a 10. The cinematography was brilliant, the acting was adequate, the spooks were spooky, just needed less formula and more originality.<br/><br/>I'm glad I went to see this in the theater. I'm also glad I saw 30 Days of Night in the theater. (to give you a reference of my taste) Even though its a 7, its easily the best movie I've seen all year, and likely will hold on to that spot if Insidious 2 doesn't knock it from top spot. You WON'T be disappointed."

","gosh (ghost) -- The movie started with the nice backdrop of America in the 60's era . Patrick and vera opens up with the way the exorcism is performed and the technicalities of being paranormal researchers . the movie picked up the pace at the right moment and slowly caught up in the web of some terrifying horror scenes . This director knows his stuff . His approach is flawless adding with some good performances from patrick Wilson and vera fermiga . kept us on the edge of the seat all the while .<br/><br/>One of the best horror movies i had seen as far as my memory goes back . The cinemas we had been to , was filled with some exciting screams . Certainly a thumbs -up in this genre . <br/><br/>Go watch it .. But not alone !!"

","This movie is the latest from James wan who has done Saw, Dead silence, and Insidious. And he delivers like no other time. <br/><br/>This movie got rated R because of its scares and well it was scary as f*** and I want to see it again. The thing that makes this movie scarier is the angles of the camera and the sounds but the makeup also makes the movie amazing. So if sinister and the conjuring have a battle the conjuring will kick sinister a ass in many ways shapes and forms............ So yea don't bring anyone under 13. Oh and the people who are comparing it to insidious are wrong it does not feel like insidious in any way it actually feels like a different director completely."
"stevendbeard","7","0","1","19 July 2013"," Good Scares
","I saw ""The Conjuring"", starring Vera Farmiga-Bates Motel-t.v., The Departed; Patrick Wilson-The A-Team-2010, Lakeview Terrace; Lili Taylor-Public Enemies, High Fidelity and Ron Livingston-Dinner for Schmucks, Office Space. <br/><br/>This is a horror film that reminded me of the older classic horror films, such as 'The Amityville Horror', 'The Exorcist' and 'Poltergeist'. Maybe it's because there are not a lot of CGI special effects used. Instead, it is mostly actors in make up as the demon spirits. This movie is also based on a true story and takes place in the early 1970's. Vera and Patrick are a married couple that are paranormal investigators or demonologists-she has psychic abilities that drain her every time she uses them. They investigate paranormal activities and either debunk a situation as having a normal explanation or they help get rid of the problem-they have to call the Vatican if an exorcism is needed. Patrick even has a room in his house where he keeps occult mementos from his past cases, as souvenirs. Anyone visiting the room can look at, but not touch, an object, in case they were to release some evil. Lili and Ron are a married couple with 5 little girls that buy a haunted house and call upon the services of Patrick and Vera after strange happenings start disrupting their lives. I thought it was suspenseful and had some pretty good scares. It is rated ""R"" for violence and terror and has a running time of 1 hour & 52 minutes. I would buy this on DVD."
"EllaMentree","8","0","2","19 July 2013"," Unique Horror experience with solid pacing; Not a typical ""ghost story""
","It's a very unique Horror experience. It keeps a moderate pace while still giving more than enough time to introduce the central characters so you get a feel for them, their motives, and a sense of empathy as these horrible things happen to them.<br/><br/>There is some back-story, a flashback or two, and the main story is occasionally punctuated by lessons taught by Demonologists (Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson) who eventually get involved with the story of the Warrens.<br/><br/>What makes it really notable amongst horror movies is that it's fairly hard to predict. Yes, there are tropes like there are in all horror movies, but it doesn't follow Poltergeist to a T and it has a fair few twists and turns that will really catch you off guard.<br/><br/>Another thing is that there are very few ""jump scares."" There's a lot of building tension, but surprisingly little ""ahh oh my gosh there's a scary ghost behind you!!"" And once the center of all the trouble is revealed, things escalate very quickly. There's no horrible torture or mindless gore, but there is blood and some seriously unsettling scenes that take place.<br/><br/>I give it an 8.5/10 (but for IMDb purposes I have to give it an 8), meaning I think it's extremely watchable, memorable, notable, and something worth being put on a top 10 list somewhere.<br/><br/>And another thing: You definitely need to see it in theatres. Seeing this movie with a full crowd of people is the only good way to see it."
"Onthethreshold","8","0","2","19 July 2013"," Genuinely scary film unlike the competition...
","I have to admit that the selling point of 'The Conjuring' to me is the fact that it's based on a true story and I think that's what makes the story so disturbing and chilling for the audience.<br/><br/>Unlike films such as 'Paranormal Activity' or 'Insidious' this is not just simply meant to frighten you but to actually make you think about how there are evil spirits out there among us and that stories like this, many of which we probably will never know about, do exist. <br/><br/>The acting was superb and not over done by any means. It's not a fast paced thriller and it's more deliberate pace is the stuff stories are made of in place of a cheap thrill. <br/><br/>There are many pretenders to this genre of film. 'The Conjuring' is most certainly an original and a must-see."
