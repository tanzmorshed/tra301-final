","Gangs of New York is just perfect entertainment. It is an enthralling, bloody, melodramatic epic that more than justifies its two and one half hour running time. In Gangs director Martin Scorsese spins another tale of the New York underworld but with a twist. Instead of the mid-twentieth century organized crime milieu of Goodfellas, Scorsese ventures back to the 19th century to show us the origin of the modern street gang.<br/><br/> It's the early 1860s and the notorious Five Points slum is ruled by the savage `Bill the Butcher'. The viciously nationalistic Bill terrorizes all the immigrant masses jammed into his slum but seems to harbor a particular hatred for the Irish population. Into this seething cauldron wanders mysterious young Amsterdam Vallon who soon works his way into the trust and affection of Bloody Bill. Amsterdam, however, has a past with the unsuspecting Butcher and sports an agenda not unlike a certain Prince of Denmark. Bloody vengeance and dark betrayal soon come to pass, all played against a backdrop of corruption and unrest that lead to up to the horrors of New York Civil War draft riots.<br/><br/> Daniel Day-Lewis is marvelous as Bill the Butcher. His Bill is both recognizably human and a full bore, moustache-twirling villain. Day-Lewis strides his savage and profane way across the screen and steals the whole of the movie. The only other actor to approach Day-Lewis' level is Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed. Broadbent is Tweed's spitting image and he makes the grasping old pirate so winning we find ourselves rooting for Tweed against the gaggle of reformers that infest his domain.  Though Leonardo DiCaprio is the nominal lead of the picture he is overshadowed by his co-stars.  Large, slope shouldered and vaguely brutish looking, DiCaprio is physically perfect for Amsterdam.  While he could have used some of the fire and rage of a young James Cagney, DiCaprio's acting is superior throughout the movie. The problem is that Amsterdam just isn't as flashy a role as Bill or Tweed and, as good as DiCaprio is; Day-Lewis operates on a whole other level. Cameron Diaz as the beautiful pickpocket Jenny,  never convinces that she is a product of the slums. Despite having considerable screen time, Diaz fades into the background when compared to her more powerful co-stars.<br/><br/> Just as important as the actors are to Gangs is the period atmosphere that drips off the screen. The amazing old New York set has an air of lived in reality that you could cut with a knife. You can almost smell the vermin. Gangs is entirely free of the embalmed feeling you get from most modern period movies.  The cast handles the period argot as if it were their true speech and wear their costumes like lived-in clothing. You come away convinced that this is how the world looked and sounded in 1862.<br/><br/> Scorsese does eschew all nuance and subtlety in Gangs. Instead he tells his tale in wide, bold, exploitive and melodramatic strokes that make the movies two and a half hours fly by. Be warned that if you are waiting to see Gangs on DVD you are making a huge mistake. Gangs has to be seen at the theater. The detail and scope of the film cries out to be viewed in all its wide screen glory.  This movie is a fantastic achievement."

","You'd think Scorcese has bitten a bit more than he could possibly chew, this time. Well, he didn't. Gangs of new York is not an ""epic masterpiece"" and it ain't that because I seriously doubt the directors aim was that. It's a great movie in it's own account, but you have to watch it in the right way.<br/><br/>The plot: Tight enough and well paced, with a couple of lows (expected for a three-hour film) but generally it comes out pretty neat. Some may find it disturbing, as it contains extreme violence and it does not portray an America of happy workers, even happier slaves, benevolent rich and just authorities - instead, it portraits the true 1860 society. Definitely not for those who like their films with plenty of sugar on the top.<br/><br/>The epic and the drama: Well, basically the film is the story of two men. Around them things evolve and a brave new world comes forth - but we only get to watch snapshots of that world. Until the last sequence, that is when the whole city ""explodes"" (in some occasions literally...) and the streets are being covered in blood, and the two aspects (the main story and the events of the era) are being tied together in the same continuum.<br/><br/>At the same time, the director attempts to portrait the whole birth and growth of the United States, in a kind of parabole, but without loosing his focus on the main story and the surrounding. Scorsese dives deeply into the psychology of his heroes, without giving out any explanation of their acts other than the probable - he lets us figure it out ourselves, and that's a God-given gift.<br/><br/>The visuals: The film is disturbing, as it contains extreme violence. There are literally streams of blood, hacking, slashing, crushing - even some action movie fans (hey dude, look, he smashed his head with that thing... cool, man!"") might find some parts of the film interesting. The last sequence is visually astounding, and it's by it's own account a reason to watch this film over and over again... if you got the stomach to actually cope with the disturbing images, that is.<br/><br/>The actors: I didn't think it would come a day when I'd say that Leo Di Caprio can act, but ...here I go: The kid can act. And quite good too. Guess he needed a Scorsese to put him in the right path. Same with Cameron Diaz - she has got some potential, seems so. Too bad she wastes it in films like ""the sweetest thing"" and other throw-ups like that. And... Daniel Day Lewis. Truly, with this performance, they should give him the Academy award. He portrays the vile ""Butcher"" in a way few would be able of, and he adds depth to a character that could very easily end up ""two-dimensional"". He is stunningly good.<br/><br/>New York, New York: Scorsese gets involved in something that compares to his previous work the way a fancy little sports car compares to a huge truck: A grandioso film of epic proportions and of great ambition. He does deliver, I believe. But this film shall not be acknowledged universally, because there is too much violence, corruption, lack of the good old white vs black (good vs evil, I mean) concept and does not sweeten the pill in any way. It's disturbing and raw, and it's a great. It's not a political film - in such, the director usually picks a stance, a ""true"" hero, an opposing view, and builds upon those. In this case, the director is truly endistancemented and keeps that distance, even from his ""hero"". There are no ""good"" people in that movie, all are acting like chess pieces in a predetermined way, but at the same time they try to burst out and do their own.<br/><br/>The verdict: A fabulous film, which is going to be recognized for such in some years"
"Buddy-51","Null","112","150","26 January 2003"," great filmmaking overcomes banal story
","Finding yourself brooding over the sorry state of civilization lately? If so, I would strongly recommend you take a trip to `Gangs of New York' and see how much worse things USED to be in the not too distant past.  The film is Martin Scorcese's epic paean to the Lawlessness That Made America Great, a theme most often explored against a Far West backdrop, out on the open prairie or in two-bit towns like Tombstone, Arizona or Dodge City, Kansas. Here it's been transferred to 1860's New York City, which in Scorcese's vision, turns out to be a veritable Dickensian hellhole of vice and corruption, a place teeming with rival gangsters, pickpockets, corrupt politicians, lawbreaking policemen, and even firefighters so obsessed with matters of jurisdiction that they do physical battle with rival departments while an unattended building goes up in flames behind them.  This is a world where life has no value and where a man's existence can be snuffed out without so much as a by-your-leave or a single person left behind to mourn him.  The members of these rival gangs make the Sharks and the Jets - who would make their appearance on the same turf a full century later - look like mere pantywaists in comparison.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is a masterpiece, offering some of the best cinematography, art direction and costume design of any film released in 2002.  With the help of some master craftsmen, Scorcese has created a complete world unto itself, one that doesn't look quite like anything we have ever seen on film before.  The setting provides a stunning mixture of the real and the surreal, with everything from the clapboard buildings to the foot-tall hats deriving their style from extrapolated exaggeration. It is truly an astonishing, eye-popping achievement.<br/><br/>The same cannot necessarily be said for the rest of the film, however. Based on a story by former film critic Jay Cocks, the screenplay by Steven Zaillian, Kenneth Lonergan and Cocks himself never quite achieves the level of greatness promised by the setting.  The main drawback is the story itself, which is basically just a trite revenge melodrama all gussied up in fancy period clothes.  Leonardo DiCaprio takes center stage as Amsterdam Vallon, a young man who, as a boy, witnessed the murder of his father at the hands of Bill `the Butcher' Cutting, the meanest man ever to terrorize the streets of this fledgling metropolis.  Bill, who is an expert with knives and other cutting instruments, is the man all the denizens of the section of the city known as The Five Fingers fear, and he is able to use that fear to make himself undisputed king of the area.  After a 16-year absence, Amsterdam returns to the scene of the crime, determined to even the score and make Bill pay for his offense with his life.<br/><br/>Despite the glories of the setting, Scorcese is never able to bring the story itself to life.  Perhaps DiCaprio is just too weak and passive to make a very convincing foil for the hard-as-steel Bill Cutting (who seems heavily derived from Dickens' Bill Sikes character in `Oliver Twist,' a literary source that never seems too far from the minds of the movie's authors). Perhaps Daniel-Day Lewis is just too convincing in the role of villain to make it seem like anything even close to an even match.  Perhaps, too, the obligatory romantic plot strand involving DiCaprio with a miscast Cameron Diaz is simply too hokey to fit into the grim tale being told here. Whatever the reason, the core of the film turns out to be the weakest element of  `Gangs of New York.'  Moreover, the dialogue is utterly banal and uninspired, consisting mainly of syrupy platitudes and half-baked philosophizing.  Lucky for us, then, that the director has provided us with enough visual stimulation to keep us at least intrigued, if not quite fascinated, throughout.<br/><br/>What does fascinate us, however, is all the historical detail that permeates the outer fringes of the story.  These include the ever-present backdrop of the Civil War, which keeps encroaching into the world these people inhabit, and the anti-war riots that tore virtually all of New York City apart - both of which the filmmakers use as a kind of macrocosmic comment on the petty battles and rivalries taking place in this hellish part of town.  In moments like these, `Gangs of New York' almost touches greatness.  Also of interest is the way in which the film highlights the fervid anti-immigration attitude that has so completely permeated the history of a country that, in a bewildering paradox, has always prided itself (in theory, at least, if not always in practice) on being the great `melting pot' for the world's downtrodden and disenfranchised to flock to - and the film reminds us of how prevalent that anti-immigrant attitude still is today in many quarters. Truly, some things never change.<br/><br/>In some ways, this film might make an interesting companion piece to Scorcese's `Casino,' in that both films deal with the theme of lawlessness and corruption making way for legal conformity and respectability.  Each of these works, so distant from one another in time and place, manages to portray the kind of epic birth pangs that cities and countries often have to go through before they can call themselves truly `civilized.'  This theme is, undoubtedly, what led Scorcese to compose a kind of visual ode to New York City in his closing shot, his own personal valentine to a city that has suffered so much in the past few years.  It is his way of saying that, from such squalid beginnings, New York City has grown into the great cultural center that it is today and that it can be proud of its heritage and the people who helped make it.  After the events of 9/11, that is a very powerful and stirring sentiment indeed.<br/><br/>Yes, `Gangs of New York' is a severely flawed film in a lot of ways, but it is also a work of vision and of almost unparalleled technical accomplishment that deserves to be seen.  Even if there is not much here to engage the mind or the heart, you can always feast your eyes on the glorious visions unfolding up there on the screen."

","""Gangs of New York"" takes us back to a time when America was a young country and New York was divided.  Those who felt they were ""native"" Americans did not want immigrants to enter their great country, spawning hatred between groups all over the city where many of them landed.  In the story we see how much of the town is run by one man, with William Cutting (""Bill the Butcher,"" played marvelously by Daniel Day-Lewis) being the most feared and well-respected man of the ""five Points.""<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, who as a boy watched Bill the Butcher kill his father in one of the Points' great battles.  Now a grown man, he returns to the Points to find Bill pretty much running the show.  He gets on Bill's good side and eventually becomes his number one man, all the while still plotting for his father's revenge.<br/><br/>While there is a lot of gratuitous violence and gore, the film does an excellent job portraying life as it was in New York.  You can be sucked in to the time of the movie, and even though the setting is much before our time you don't need a textbook to understand how things were run and what life was like.<br/><br/>I've never been a big DiCaprio fan, but his effort here (along with his performance from ""Catch Me If You Can"") have made my opinion start to waver a little.  He is good as Amsterdam, and believable in his actions and expressions.  Daniel Day-Lewis is simply phenomenal as Bill the Butcher and really should have won the Best Actor Oscar.  Overall, I feel this was the best film of 2002 and really was robbed at the Academy Awards.<br/><br/>8 out of 10."
"DannyDisaster","8","18","22","18 March 2018"," Daniel Day-Lewis is just amazing
","It's so true what people say, that Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't act. He *becomes* the characters he portrays. It's simply astounding to see an interview with the soft-spoken, somewhat effeminate actor and then watch him as the terrifying, dominating Butcher in this, or Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood. Watch Gangs of New York for his performance alone and you won't be disappointed. That isn't to say the story isn't intriguing (it is) or Leo isn't good (he is) but really, Day-Lewis stole the show outright."
"anna2","8","94","135","27 December 2002"," A Great Movie, Worth The Wait
","For about three months now, I have (on an almost daily basis) passed a movie theatre not far from my home. On the side of this movie theatre is a huge poster advertising the movie ""Gangs of New York"". Meanwhile, all I heard about on television was the buzz about the upcoming ""Gangs of New York"". So, when this highly publicized movie finally opened, I went and saw it.<br/><br/>I went to the theatre, I bought my ticket, I found a seat in a very crowded theatre and I sat. For three hours I sat in that dark theatre and I watched what was one of the most amazing movies I have ever had privilege to see.<br/><br/>It is hard to even begin to explain why this movie was amazing, but it was. The way it was shot is brilliant. The cinematography is spectacular. The story is completely enthralling.<br/><br/>Although the movie was just shy of three hours long, it was not at all boring to watch. The story was captivating and although I knew how it was going to end (because, after all, it is a movie based on a true-ish story), it was incredible to watch how it got that end.<br/><br/>Above all, the movie was beautiful to watch. I have to admit to those who have not yet seen it that ""Gangs"" is quite violent. However, the violence was well shot and it was fairly necessary to the story.<br/><br/>All of the actors put in extremely good performances. Leonardo DiCaprio really proved that he's not just a pretty face and that he does actually have a great deal of talent (which can also be seen in his other movie of the season, ""Catch Me If You Can""). Cameron Diaz' performace also proves that she can do much more than the standard romantic comedy. Also, after hearing reports of Daniel Day Lewis' REALLY getting into his character, I admit that it was completely worth it. His character (William Cutting/Bill the Butcher) is so complex and although you know you hate him, you can't decide why (for there are so many reasons).<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you have not seen this movie yet, go. Go now. See it. This is one of the epic movies of our time. I heard that Scorcese has been conceptualizing this movie for over twenty years; I could tell. The story this movie tells is one  that I had never heard and the way in which it was told makes it seem very important for us to know. The message that is conveyed, although not an entirely wholesome one, is an important one to learn and, if considered, is very relevant to our time. However, my only message to you is this: see this movie."

"ccthemovieman-1","8","105","160","17 November 2005"," Daniel Day-Lewis: Spectacular Performance
","Daniel Day-Lewis elevates this film from just ""good"" to ""very good"" or even ""excellent."" He is absolutely riveting, one of the most interesting ""villains"" I have ever seen on film. I am sorry Day-Lewis didn't win the Academy Award for his performance. He was just outstanding to watch. His facial expressions alone cracked me up!<br/><br/>Day-Lewis played ""Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting"" he is one nasty dude. However, there are no real ""good guys"" in this story. The supposed hero, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, is a revenge-seeking man with a ton of flaws himself. The rest of the characters are either thieves, gang members, corrupt politicians or corrupt policeman. Ah yes, another family-oriented film from that kindly director Martin Scorcese.<br/><br/>What Scorcese lacks in family values, he comes close to making up for in style. This is another fascinating visual film with great sets, costumes, color and camera-work. Other typical Scorcese touches are in here: Catholic-bashing and brutal language. (I question whether the f-word was used back in the days this film takes place.)<br/><br/>All in all, a tough film that could be too unpleasant to watch but for Lewis' outstanding performance and the spectacular visuals."
"CubsandCulture","10","5","5","17 February 2020"," A sprawling American mess
","This is the first Scorsese film I managed to watch in the theater. I was pretty much the only person in my group that appreciated the film. The script and storyline is confused and includes a lot of things that end up being historical detail, i.e. most of the Boss Tweed stuff. Likewise the revenge story and pseudo-love triangle at the heart of the film is a bit too pat. Diaz gives a pretty slipshod performance in this as well. Even as I was blown away with the rest of the film I recognized these significant problems. Re-watching the film the other I was even more impressed with the film's ambition-despite some of that ambition being denied- and how much Bill's nativism feels like a dire warning for Trumpianism. The film is still quite messy but it struck me as a mess to get lost in.<br/><br/>As a ""character"" study of the social conditions of New York city c 1860's this is a very good film. Much of the historical milieu is vivid and the resulting ugly world is a good counterpoint of much of the sanitized history you get in school. The film's narrative shortcomings are worth the hit to get a fuller sense of the environment these characters exist in. While parts of the history could have been handled better-the riots at the end were race riots!-ultimately I think this is a good primer.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis is probably the best part; the semi-confessional scene when at night with the flag draped over Bill is the scene I think everyone should watch again. It is a dire warning of where we are heading. The film humanizes the know-nothings at the same time it is condemning them. This is a dark film that brings to light much of Americana's underbelly."

"bob the moo","Null","99","154","25 February 2006"," The narrative and characters are weak but the general sweep and spectacle of the whole thing makes it worth a look
","In the 1840's New York is a mess of gangs all fighting over small areas of turf. The main rivalry is between the immigrant Irish and those who see themselves as Natives of their New York. A battle rages between them and the leader of the Irish (Priest Vallon) falls to the blade of Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting  witnessed by Vallon's young son. Sixteen years later and things are different but no better. Cutting is now the head of the Five Corners and all the gangs answer to him. It is into this situation that an unknown man called Amsterdam returns  none other than the grown son of Priest Vallon. Seeking a fitting revenge for the death of his father, Amsterdam makes sure he catches Cutting's sole eye and gradually is taken into his trust.<br/><br/>Despite lukewarm reviews I decided that any Scorsese film is worth a look and gave GoNY a night of my time. In terms of plotting the film is essentially a revenge drama that sees Vallon trying to get close enough to Cutting to take him out in a fashion befitting the man. You might rightly point out that such a straightforward tale does not require 180 minutes to tell but it does when the film tries to make this much more of a sprawling affair that aims to bridge the cinematic gap between the western and the gangster films while also painting a rich tapestry of characters against a rich background of 19th Century New York. However it fails to do this on several levels and the end result is a film that feels a lot baggier than it really should have done. This is best seen in the characters because none of them really develop beyond the first impressions they give, or a better example is the failure of the film to use Jenny in the critical way that she was clearly intended to be used.<br/><br/>Scorsese may lose his way with the story but it is easy to forgive him because he does so well with the majestic historical sweep he gives to everything else. The sets look great, the costumes look great and the dramatic flair he gives in delivery add so much. It is a real problem that he has not taken the characters and story along for the ride but I found his silver lining to be enjoyable even if his rather OTT approach did further take away from the realism of the people and the story. His approach is matched by the cast, who are mostly enjoyable despite lacking depth. DiCaprio is more than the bland pinup I had feared he would be but he can't do much more than play the ""silent revenge"" card from start to finish. He is overwhelmed by Day-Lewis who has great fun in a fantastically OTT role that worked much better than I expected him to. Diaz is not that good and I felt she was miscast in an attempt to get ""credibility"" by working with Scorsese. The support cast is roundly good and features solid turns from Neeson, Reilly, Gleeson and many others fill out a strong cast.<br/><br/>Overall this is an impressive film in terms of sweep and style but not in terms of story and characters  which is a bit of a problem in a film that pretty much lasts three hours. The skill of Scorsese and the presence of so many stars make it worth a look but it is hard to get past the problems in the way that the story is not as well done as it could have been, even if the general historical sweep and spectacle makes it worth taking a look at."
"RHKLWK","6","208","337","2 July 2003"," Suppressed History Finally Surfaces
","I am a Civil War ""buff,"" so I wanted to see this movie the moment I heard it was being made.  Yes, the New York Draft Riots did happen, just two weeks AFTER the Northern victory at Gettysburg, demonstrating that the outcome of the War was anything but certain, even after Lee had been forced to retreat to the south bank of the Potomac River.  Today, many would find this surprising.<br/><br/>The movie did take some license, however.  There was no wholesale firing on civilians by Union soldiers.  In fact, reported deaths after three days of rioting were less than one-hundred.  Many of the dead were randomly selected blacks, who were hanged and mutilated (which was accurately depicted in the film).  Today, many would also find this surprising, because the schools teach that the North was good, and the South was bad.  The truth is that blacks were subjected to inhumane treatment everywhere, especially in the Nothern cities.<br/><br/>There was also no firing by offshore naval vessels.  That was artistic license.  (My source for all of the above is a doctoral dissertation that was published about ten years ago titled ""The New York City Draft Riots."")<br/><br/>The movie makes the important point that the North had run out of ""home grown"" manpower to fight the South.  Had it not been for Irish and German volunteers through 1863, and black volunteers in 1864, the North would have sued for peace.  The 1864 Democratic Platform promised to bring the War to a swift and speedy conclusion.<br/><br/>Bravo to Scorsese for bringing all of this to light.  In the meantime, the movie is about twenty minutes to long.  The brothel scenes, the ""uptown"" scenes, and some of the scenes in the catacombs struck me as slow and superfluous.  On the other hand, the street scenes and the scenes of the random gangs (of which I wish there were more) were glorious. <br/><br/>
One thing Scorsese left out, however:  The mountains of animal and human waste in the streets!  Not long after his movie was released, the History Channel produced a documentary on the Five Points area, and it is staggering to consider the tons and tons of animal and human waste piling up in the streets, and the thousands of gallons of urine running in the gutters. There were old photos of waste in the streets stacked six feet high. Needless to say, infant mortality in such a fetid environment was about 50%. Scorsese leaves this out, and there is scarcely a horse in the movie.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis does a superb job with a character that is unevenly developed.  He is a homicidal thug in the beginning, a menacing, but somewhat benign, presence in the middle, and a psychotic killer in the end.  It isn't really clear why he vacillates the way he does.  Bi-polar, I guess.  DiCaprio proves he can act, and he exudes a manliness he did not possess in earlier films.  Diaz turns in a creditable performance.  The cast of thousands adds a nice touch to the film.<br/><br/>I would never say this is a ""great"" film, but it certainly is worth a look. Kudos to Scorsese for the herculean effort, and a tip of the kepi for the poetic ending, which reminded me of the ending in 1936's ""San Francisco."""
"aleator","5","21","29","19 January 2003"," Dodgy accents...dodgy acting.
","The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis stands out from what is a seriously flawed movie. Leonardo DiCaprio is seriously miscast,the story is hardly inspiring and the film suffers from problems with continuity. All of the cast look far too well fed and healthy to be the poorest of the poor - and did they really live in subterranean dwellings that look like caves? Scorsese is a great director but his preoccupation with the low life seems morally repugnant here. Historical accuracy goes out the window as the gang members are portrayed in a semi-heroic light. The love interest grafted on in the shape of Cameron Diaz is pathetic. A lot of praise has been heaped on the film's attention to period detail and there are indeed some interesting observations - I particularly liked the 'Allsorts' barrel in the bar wherein all the slops are thrown to provide a cheap drink. However it was impossible to avoid the impression that you were simply watching a crowd of  extras parading around a large film set in period costume. Every scene was laid on with a trowel."
"janefondafan","10","88","143","4 January 2003"," Intense, disturbing and powerful
","Well, I just got back from seeing ""Gangs of New York"" at the theater, and I have many positive things to say about this film.  It's easily the most powerful film I've seen this year, even topping the excellent ""White Oleander"".  I have never seen a film portray poverty in the 1800's as well as this film did.  It also made me feel like I was there, witnessing the poverty and brutality.  It's a film that makes us be thankful that times like those have passed, and for us not to forget those who lived and died during those times.  It's also a film that's not afraid to show war in its total uglyness.  Martin Scorsese definately got his point across with this film, but he didn't do it alone.  The cast were all excellent in their parts, no bad acting here at all.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz showed they are more than just pretty faces.  Daniel Day-Lewis was magnificent as ""The Butcher"", a character whom you want to both love and hate.  Quite simply the best film I've seen all year, and I hope it will get nominated (and win) many Oscars.  Even if it doesn't, it's a true winner in my eyes. Nice to see that Hollywood can actually do something useful with a $100million budget for once.  This was playing at the theater the same time as ""The Two Towers""... unfortunately, most of the people in the long line-up went to see ""TTT""... they sure missed out, since GONY has more to say in the first 10 minutes than LOTR has to say over 3 hours.  Although this film is rather long (2 hrs 47 mins), I was so provoked by it that the time flew by. ""Gangs of New York"".... A film that's not to be missed!!<br/><br/>10/10 - Higly reccomended!"

","The original Mean Streets. The real Irishmen. New York, New York, 1863. This is Scorsese's ode to the founding of our great city. A founding forged in blood, prejudice and greed. Gangs of New York is a sprawling epic, and it's impossible not to like. The city of old comes alive, in full color, on gorgeous 35mm film. The acting is as fine as any Scorsese movie can get, putting aside the legendary performance that is Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. The performance of a lifetime is more apt. He chews up every. last. scene. He is disturbingly good here. The Butcher is one of the great film villains. A ruthless killer armed and motivated by hate. This character was considered for so many great actors in it's 30 year development, but thank God in the end we were given DDL. I cant imagine anyone else in this role. What's even better is that Gangs of New York never overstays it's welcome, even at 167 minutes. Like the best of Scorsese, the quality of what you are seeing very much outweighs the heft of portion size we're getting in length. I could sit through the entirety of this film again, and even if it went on for another hour longer, i'd still be right in there. Scorsese's natural ability to tell stories on screen is unparalleled. However, all is not perfect. Rarely nothing ever is. An odd choice of music and editing, at least to me, lessens the blow and muddies up the fight scene at the beginning. It felt very 2002-ish. It dates the movie significantly."

","Ever seen a film that captured all you loved and hated about not only America(for those of of you who are American),but the world,as well? A film that made you so angry,but yet left you in tears due to its compelling story,characters,and visuals?<br/><br/>For me,Gangs of New York is that film.<br/><br/>I LOVE this movie! From its heartbreaking opening,to its truly melancholy ending,this film leaves with so many mixed emotions that just further support the emotional weight of this film.If by the final scene,you don't either feel a positive or negative emotion to what you saw and the effects it had on not only the characters,but America in general,then I question your humanity.<br/><br/>Now,I am not a patriotic person.I find,as a country,America is very hypocritical,and it makes me sick,but I still care for my fellow man,and that is becoming more and more rare as time goes on.People just look out for themselves more often nowadays,and you just want to scream at them for their self-centered behavior.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is set in 1863,when gangs ran the streets of New York,and the government couldn't (or would not,whatever you prefer) gain control of the city that would one day be one of the greatest cities of the world.The story deals with the character of Amsterdam Vallon(Leonardo DiCaprico),who,when he was young,lost his father(Liam Neeson) to gang leader Bill the Butcher(Daniel Day-Lewis).Amsterdam is put in a reform school,but when he grows up,he plots to avenge his father's murder by getting close to Bill and killing him.<br/><br/>In joining Bill's gang,however,Amsterdam gets to know the man personally.Now,Bill is someone Amsterdam,and we as a viewing audience, should hate without question.But he is the interesting thing:Bill isn't unlikable.Even in all that he has done,and will do(and he does plenty,as this is an almost 3-hour film),Amsterdam finds he actually is starting to respect the man,especially when it concerns Amsterdam's father,who Bill considers as ""the only person he ever killed worth remembering.""<br/><br/>Sadly,nothing good will come out of this.Bill soon discovers who Amsterdam really is,and he won't take kindly to someone in his gang who has it out for him. And so,Amsterdam and Bill,by the film's climax,will find themselves on opposing sides in what will shape the future of ""their great city"".<br/><br/>Gangs is a wonderful film,filled with terrific performances,amazing visuals,great direction,a solid screenplay,filled with depth and themes,and,overall,a powerful message:""in the end,how significant are the quarrels of man's past? For in the end,time will fade even legend.""<br/><br/>Please see this. You will be shocked and amazed.It reminds me of how I see this country every day,and reminds me of how thankful I am for the people in my life that make life worth having."

","This movie goes for 2 hours and 50 minutes but you can hardly feel the length, Daniel Day Lewis' once again disappears into is role and it's quite frankly my favourite performance of all time. Martin Scorsese's direction and production is probably the best thing about the entire movie, he directs this film so well you couldn't tell the difference between what's real and what's not. The connection between Leo and Diaz is what I think makes the story a bit more interesting. No doubt, Scorsese should've won Best Director and Best Picture, it still pisses me off that he didn't win, but that's just proof how much credibility the Academy has.<br/><br/>Now we are gonna get into spoiler territory, so if you haven't seen this movie, see it now!!! So, this tells the story of The Dead Rabbits vs Bowery Boys, which were two street gangs back in the 19th Century, Bowery Boys were an Anti-Irish and Anti-Catholic gang that basically just killed Irish, European-American and Catholic people, and their biggest target/enemy were the Dead Rabbits which consisted of Irish-American criminals and their leader was a strong and wealthy father of our lead character, Amsterdam. Bill the Butcher Cutting (William Poole) was jealous of Priest Vallon and ends up killing our main character's father.<br/><br/>If I could write a more into detail review of his movie I would, but all I need to say about this movie has already been said, it's one of the best gang movies, the best Day-Lewis performance, one of the best Scorsese films of all time.

The movie is much more than just Bill Cutter (although he is quite enough) the other actors were superb, the directing flawless, the screenplay engaging and brilliant and the film sets as far as I know were unbelievably excellent with regard to depicting the period!

"tburke85","8","8","10","17 June 2009"," Gangs Of New York A Solid Action Crime Drama
","Gangs Of New York is a solid action crime drama from director Martin Scorcese who continues to show his skill as a filmmaker with this film. The cast are admirable in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis, and Cameron Diaz. DiCaprio is great as Amsterdam Vallon a man seeking revenge against the one who killed his father. DiCaprio may not have the flashier role like Day Lewis but he's still believable as the hero bringing that intensity he's been know for to the character. Daniel Day Lewis gives a knock out performance as Billy ""The Butcher"" Cutting a psychotic gangland kingpin who killed Amsterdams father. Day Lewis is terrific in the role of a man whose willing to kill anyone without hesitation. The people are either with him or against him there is no middle ground. Cameron Diaz is good as Jenny Everdeane a woman willing to do almost anything to survive and a potential love interest for DiCaprio's Amsterdam. John C Reilly, Jim Broadbent, Bredan Gleason, Henry Thomas, and a brief appearance by Liam Neeson are effective as the supporting characters but most of them don't have much to do and aren't in it much either. All of them still turn in solid performances none the less in their limited screen time. Most of the movie takes place in New York during 1863 when one of the worst riots in American history took place. The fact that this really did happen gave the movie a realistic fool especially the location where they chose to have this film take place giving audiences a look at what it could've been like back then in New York. The action sequences which mostly involve people getting beat up in brutal ways are well executed especially the riots at the end. The showdown between Amsertdam and Bill was a bit of a letdown but it was fitting for the movie. The film was a bit long with a running time of 167 minutes. The pacing was a little slow at times but the performances by the cast make it worth watching anyway. Despite some flaws Gangs Of New York is still a well made crime drama with enough action, some suspense, a little humor and romance. So if you can get past the long running time Gangs Of New York is definitely worth watching and most of that besides what I already mentioned is because of the exceptional performances (especially Day Lewis and DiCaprio) by the lead actors and the amazing talent of Scorcese who continues to prove himself as a gifted filmmaker with this movie. Well done."

","Directed by Martin Scorsese. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, Henry Thomas, John C.

A feast for the senses, especially Dante Ferretti's sensational set design and a soundtrack mixing eclectic folk compositions with Howard Shore's stirring score (to say nothing for an Oscar-nominated tune from U2), it's like plunging into a grimy furnace for the better part of three punishing hours and emerging crusty, smeared, victorious. Like his other gangster sagas, Scorsese fills the story and screen with juicy details on the fringes that elevates the material above mere revenge story set in city filth; it's ultimately about the bloody birth of ""America"" as fought on the streets of its largest, messiest metropolis. Loses some narrative momentum in the last hour but rarely falls short of engrossing, oft-mesmerizing. Day-Lewis tears into the role of the rapacious but undeniably charismatic Bill the Butcher with so much relish that it's nearly impossible to take eyes off him; so potent, he often reduces his primary co-stars (DiCaprio & Diaz, both doing solid period work) to mere fresh meat wanting for tenderizing. Not quite on the same tier as Scorsese's most searing, towering masterpieces, but very close, and this one is arguably the most purely ambitious film of his career.<br/><br/>91/100"

","If you want actors to play out the most outrageous, colorful and groundbreaking performances, you put Leo and Danny in front of the camera and let them do what they do. Both actors go soooo deep in there characters that the dynamic between young Vallon and Butcher alone is worth the ticket.<br/><br/>If you watch a Scorsese film you should be prepared for a nasty ride. He has a way of writing the most skin-crawling scenes without even making it explicitly skin crawling outside the actors performances.<br/><br/>The characters are fulfilling and dynamic, and I like the way Scorsese are working with the sound. Another thing I noticed is how my focus always searching for Vallons and Butchers eyes. We see faces and surroundings in a great mix.<br/><br/>I think it was the hand of fate that set Gangs Of New York on hold for 30 years.

GANGS OF NEW YORK had some really extreme opinions from its audience ,a point reflected in the comments thrown at it on this site .I didn't think it was as bad as my dad made out but like I said I could seewhere he was coming from <br/><br/>My major problem with the movie is the screenplay . the opening shot sees Bill "" The Butcher "" Cutting kill Priest Vallon in front of his son who runs away swearing revenge for his dead father . From that point onwards we know that the story will end years later with a confrontation between the two protagonists so there's no more dramatic twists for the story to take . Actually this in itself isn't too bad but what spoils the story is the way it's held up with the character interaction between Amsterdamn and Jenny Everdeane . Scorsese doesn't do romantic interlude very well and this movie proves it . In amongst this diversion there's something of a plot hole since Bill takes the young Amsterdamn under his wing even though he knows who he is . If you bumped off someones father in a street fight would you adopt their kids ? I didn't think so <br/><br/>This could have been an absolutely brilliant script and it is very good in places where we see how the gangs are structured , their ethnic mix and their political affiliations - Some are protestant with members who were born in America , some are catholic with many members born in Ireland , all are anglophobe and they all hate each other . We also see one of the most cynical episodes in American history where immigrants getting off ships at New York are immediately conscripted into the Union army unless they pay 300 dollars which eventually leads to the draft riots . When the movie concentrates on these parts of the plot it's a great film but becomes heavily bogged down by the character subplots <br/><br/>If Scorsese had directed this 20 years ago with a fraction of the budget he had here this could have been his masterwork but he seems to have overawed by riches . Everything is just a bit too grandiose and operatic to be entirely convincing . Charles Dickens had visited the five points and is recorded as saying it was the worst place on Earth . Scorsese makes the streets a little too clean , a little too Hollywood grunge , a little too glamorous in spite of everything . Leonardo Dicaprio is a very underrated actor held back by his startling good looks but he's wrong as Amsterdamn and wasn't right for the part which should have gone to an unknown . Cameron Diaz is totally unconvincing as Jenny and Scorsese could have easily given the part to a real life NY hooker while Daniel Day Lewis gives a powerhouse performance as Bill Cutting , however the role is slightly overplayed especially compared to Lewis's other work <br/><br/>Indeed everyone involved in GANGS OF NEW YORK in whatever capacity has done far better in other movies and at the end of the day this is a very unsatisfying flawed picture which received more nominations than it did prizes at award ceremonies , and I'm somewhat happy about that because this movie isn't a crowning achievement for anyone , especially Martin Scorsese or Daniel Day Lewis who are capable of better things <br/><br/>Seven out of Ten"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Scorsese is competent enough at what he does, But since `Taxi Driver,' that hasn't been worth watching until now.<br/><br/>The world of film is rife with gangs battling for the soul of the viewer. One of those gangs is led by the `old' Scorsese -- it rallies under the banner of character-driven storytelling. He finds a story with characters of excess, and peoples them with actors of excess. The story spins not from the people or situation, but from the excess itself. This is not native to cinema, it is an immigrant trend, imported into the world of film. All the devices of cinema are subservient to the characters. The camera literally is attached to the (usually) men. that's the old Scorsese gang. Spielberg runs a similar gang.<br/><br/>Opposed are a collection of gangs that build films first from cinematic vision, then enfold story and characters -- the different visions and enfolding techniques differentiate these gangs, but they all hate the interlopers from literature who do illustrated books. These gangs are native to film, and include dePalma, Tarkovsky, Welles, Kurosawa, Kubrick.<br/><br/>
But with this film our man Martin enters the world of cinema first before doing anything else and effects a conversion. It is his first film since `Taxi Driver' to assign the camera to the situation instead of the character. In this film, the star is the  tone and feel of the place, and the forces surrounding that place: the characters are third in the hierarchy. It is a masterful and welcome switch of allegiance.<br/><br/>Oh, we have a story, the ordinary insipid stuff about a girl and bruised suitors, about political power, about revenge. And we have at least one actor who knows how to control and channel excess (now that Deniro is retired from real acting). It is what everyone will talk about, but none of that really matters. What matters is Scorsese's new eye.<br/><br/>This camera understands the situation while creating it. In the past, his camera has been attached to the man. Here, it is attached to the space instead: most spectacularly the caves under the brewery and in the five points intersection. The eye creates the situation first -- cinematically -- in which the characters move. The fights here, both at the beginning and end, really make the `Lord of The Rings' work seems ordinary if large. That's because longtime editor Schoonmaker has had a similar epiphany and assembles the shots around a scene and not a face. She got her start with `Finnegans Wake' (IMDB has it incorrectly listed with an apostrophe) and here she returns to those roots.<br/><br/>Scorsese is no longer the leader of a gang, but a member of the ones that matter, situated.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 4: Worth watching."

The flick features blood and guts street riots reminiscent of ""Braveheart"", a romance which doesn't work, an evil guy over acted by Day-Lewis and little else save a whole bunch of filler to give us a taste of the times and milk the extravagance for all its worth.

","'Gangs of New York' is the story of Irish immigrants fighting with the New York's 'natives' back in 1860. It is extremely gruesome and violent throughout the movie, (braveheart x5). Although well-paced, it may feel a bit slow at some times (its runtime is around two hours, forty minutes). I found the end of the movie (the rioting part), a bit confusing. Now the upside: The era is portrayed very well, even though the costumes seem to be a little bit overdone. This movie will keep you in tense from beginning to end, from its settings to acting, it is very well done. DiCaprio and Diaz are their regulars, but Day-Lewis is unbelievable.

"ragingbull1980","10","20","31","22 February 2005"," A selfish indulgence I can't escape
","Gangs of New York is a flawed picture, but oh what a masterfully entertaining flawed picture. Buoyed by the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, and quite possibly one of the greatest villains ever to appear on screen, the movie is a wonderfully detailed, semi-fictional account of New York in the 1860's--when the country was a political hotbed and the people were as ruthlessly dug in and divided as... well, today.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is good, and maybe great even. But how would we know? The picture belongs to the Butcher--perhaps DiCaprio's ability to allow the villain to shine as he is and not attempt to steal the spotlight is a credit to the young actor. After all, he's not really the main character--rather, he's the pair of eyes through which we see this complex war-torn, urban society. The main character is Bill Cutting, whose moral, political, and xenophobic complexities mirror the contradictions in all Americans, particularly of that period--though such contradictions have been the subject of American historical fiction for two and a half centuries.<br/><br/>Scorsese makes this picture the way it should be made, with caution to the wind and a heart bursting with vivid imagination that can be seen in every nook and cranny of the massive Five Points neighborhood on screen. He indulges in every turn to fill the film with multiple thematic elements, running at once both concurrent and in contradiction to one another. This creates a film that many people are uncomfortable with because let's face it: with all this going on, where's the plot? I think the plot, fragile as it is, only exists to deliver this world and its characters for us to observe, consume, and relish in. I certainly do. For all of its mistakes, it is a film I continue to watch over and over again, with a fascination I reserve perhaps for only three or four other films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I love this movie, God help me."

","Whatever you do, do not waste your dough on this trash. They say it's directed by Martin Scorsese, but it was obviously directed by Kevin Costner. Think *WaterWorld* without the pleasant diversion of being able to look at the ocean. Not only is it pointlessly violent (and I'm a guy who doesn't at all mind the occasional decapitation or disemboweling as someone is telling me a story), but my god is this moving BORING!<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis plays a Bill Sykes-send up with a truly laughable makeup job and an accent that's as carefree as the wind. You never really know why he hates Irish immigrants so much (a mere generation away from being an immigrant himself), and you never understand why everyone in The Five Points slum is so loyal toward and protective of him when he does absolutely nothing to alleviate the poverty and squalor of their senseless, miserable lives. (Oh yeah, since his legitimate front is as a butcher, he occasionally throws a decent steak their way.) Don't get me started on Cameron Diaz, The Whore With The Heart of Gold (because THAT's a story that hasn't been told enough) who, inexplicably is the only character in the movie with clean teeth. Liam Neeson, who croaks before the end of the first reel, is one lucky bastard.<br/><br/>After the first 20 minutes, of course, anyone not watching the movie in Braille understands perfectly what the one and only dramatic issue is going to be (REVENGE!!) and you can step out for Chinese while the movie drags its ass toward its inevitable and tedious conclusion. Granted, *Gangs* might have made some use of the obvious Shakespearean themes, but Scorsese doesn't even try to handle them. Thus, though you might entertain a flicker of interest in the Hamletesque question of whether the son will avenge the father, you wind up so bored w/DiCaprio that you don't freakin' care anymore by the time he gets around to doing the deed (which is rather done for him before he even bothers to show up).<br/><br/>In fact, though Leonardo keeps staring out at you from that bland little face and trying to convince you that he's struggling with Complex Moral Issues, the fact is: Every single person in this movie is reprehensible and evil, with differences in degree but never in kind. And if there are no good guys, why are you supposed to be cheering at the climactic scene when (for about the 11th time) the streets yet again run gooey w/blood and body parts?<br/><br/>And yet, Scorsese tries. Toward the end of the movie, he picks up the nearest blunt instrument and bashes away at the plot until he's grafted an obvious hero (DiCaprio) and an irrelevant hetero love story (DiCaprio and Diaz) onto it. In other words, Martin Scorsese has nothing but contempt for you. You're too stupid to realize that DiCaprio's character is a venal, murderous little crook and you'll be mollified by a pretty romance between him and a sociopathic pickpocket prostitute. Because the history of America began between the sheets.<br/><br/>This is the movie you'd get if Oliver Stone and Hannibal Lecter collaborated on an American history epic, and it's about as cynical a piece of trash as I hope never again to see."

","First of all, the movie is way too long. Parts of it are really boring.<br/><br/>Then, the story is not too interesting. Old story: bad man kills father, son escapes, son seeks revenge, son gets revenge. Most of the details that try to make the story interesting, actually make no sense.<br/><br/>First, at the start of the movie, the fight between the 2 gangs seems to respect some sacred, honorable rules, as if not fought by gangs, by thugs and murderers, but by noble samurai. In the first 2 minutes of the fight, there is absolutely no blood on the ground, on the clothes, faces or weapons of the fighters although all of them are wielding knives, axes, swords and so on. Suddenly there is some blood on the actors, but on the snow there is just a little pink paint. It looks really stupid because a fight in which about 200-300 men take part, and they all have knives and axes and swords, there would be dozens of dead and the place would look like a butchery. Also, the police could not ignore something like this.<br/><br/>Then Day Lewis's character looks to be though out as a love-him hate-him kind of guy. He is a monster, but a monster who loves his country (Hollywood BS) and who respected the man he killed in battle (DiCaprio's father, Liam Neeson). Although Day-Lewis makes the most of this character, the character itself looks surreal: a gang leader/gentleman/racist/patriot/sadistic/brave/illiterate/intelligent butcher. This is actually what this movie is about. The story fades behind Day-Lewis's character.<br/><br/>There are some other characters that seem to be in the movie just for the sake of it. The politicians, the wealthy family that at some point visits The Points - the square where most of the action takes place. These characters have no role to play in the story, yet they show up from time to time as if only to have something to fill the 2 and a half hours of the movie.<br/><br/>The other thing that has no place in this movie is the riot. The riot and the main story have no connection. The riot does not influence the outcome of the story nor vice-versa.<br/><br/>The movie is barely watchable, and if the weather outside is fine, I'd suggest you rather take a walk in a park."
"giancarlorocks","8","66","122","29 December 2002"," NOT A MASTERPIECE, BUT A GREAT 'HEAVY' FILM...
","For all its' Uber-violence, 'Gangs of New York' is a majestic piece of filmmaking. Director Martin Scorcese reunites once again with Editor Thelma Schoonmaker and Production Designer Dante Ferretti thusly recreating a potion of a country's history spectacled with infestation, disease and rampant violence. These are but some of the characteristics employed in an unconventional manner in hopes of telling a memorable story. Scorcese displays to the filmmaking world how imaginative he can be with his long overdue, epic and costly motion picture based upon a time in New York City's history where violence was not sporadic, but a necessity for survival. Set directly in New York's Five Points District, on a micro scale the film tells the vengeful story of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio), a young man who returns 16 years after being banished from Five Points after witnessing his father's defeat at the hands of a vicious rival known as Bill The Butcher; infamous for his fixation with the meats and his innate sense of slaughterous murder. Upon Amsterdam's return, he has but one aim  - avenge his father's death at the hands of the vicious 'community leader' William Cutting,, a.k.a. Bill The Butcher. Cutting prides himself as being a sadistic and remorseless thug who surrounds himself with the filth of the community in order to profit himself and his political allies. Daniel Day Lewis comes out of seclusion for a craft he apparently dislikes and simply nails this performance as a sophisticated and well-spoken murderer who has no parameters nor morals to bound him. He fights for the Yankee Way and opposes anyone who threatens the American lifestyle.<br/><br/>On a macro scale, the story is a piece of American history as it recreates the arduous battles commenced in 1846 between the Irish settlers and the Anglo- Saxon 'natives' who sought to protect their country against foreigners. In all of this, the draft riots are explicitly revealed as those who chose not to fight were sought out and forced to. At one point, the film effortlessly demonstrates how immigrants were drafted right off the boats as they had a suitcase from a foreign country one moment, and an American Uniform the next practically unable to speak the English language, yet ready to wage war against an unknown enemy.  The draft riot scene is a pivotal sequence in the film as it prepares the anti-climactic finale in which more violence and an astonishing amount of blood are spilled over the original streets of New York.  This film makes every effort in highlighting what the term 'gang' means as it has undergone various permutations in definition. The original story by Jay Cocks (The Age of Innocence) has been filtered by Kenneth Lonergan (Analyze This) and Steven Zaillan (Hannibal) and contains the conventional pratfalls of Hollywood Cinema such as double crosses and plot twists, yet they are thankfully kept to a minimal.  The story retains its core not so much on the development of the characters, but on the development of the times and interestingly enough, the interplay between Bill The Butcher and his rival Priest Vallon was stressed. Despite their differences and years after Priest's death, The Butcher still honored and celebrated his life. Sharing the same values and only divided by faith, honor was still a trait some had amidst all the ruins. Throughout all this lies an ingenious film in which Scorcese allows his characters to develop and evolve, as the film is a delicate piece of cinema balanced against a sensitive subject matter and directed with the utmost class and originality. Production Designer Dante Ferretti recreates the filth-infested streets and deplorable living conditions as poverty, decay, infestation and paucity are not spared in order to retell one of the vilest stories in recent memory. Those who are familiar with Scorcese's work will know he is the machine behind such films as 'Casino', 'Goodfellas' and the perennial classics 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull'. Those films are always under constant attack for the apparently amoral manner in which they exude violence, and now Scorcese can add the cornerstone of all violent films with 'Gangs of New York'. This is a perversely tempestuous violence-riddled film filled with gore, viciousness and intensity all in good use in order to demonstrate the living conditions when everyone had to sleep with one eye open. The film commences with no opening credits, just the company credits roll as we see Liam Neeson play the character of Priest Vallon, a highly admirable Community leader also fighting for what he believes in, the safety and prosperity of the Irish people based in New York. As the film opens, we see him bestow values upon a young Amsterdam Vallon as an opening battle sequence of epic proportions is mounting. The weapons are being bladed, prayers are being said and families are told goodbye as these warriors will clash on the streets of New York for the right to claim property and ownership of honor amongst thieves. Eerily close to the Brian De Palma School of suspenseful filmmaking, Scorcese seems to take a page from the aforementioned Director as the opening sequence is mounted in a very resourceful manner. Quick editing cuts thanks to Thelma Schoonmaker's hand demonstrate the weapons being sharpened as one tracking camera shot pans through the Dead Rabbits Gang led by Priest Vallon as the increasing volume in music indicates war is near. The camera tracks all the characters as we have been inside from the beginning of the film, and we have been introduced to the poverty and wretchedness of the times in a dark and cold shelter. Then the camera points towards a door and as it opens, all we see is a blanket of white symbolically representing the purity of the war and its' valor, but foreshadowing the red coat of paint about the cover the cobble stoned streets of New York. Phenomenal. That is filmmaking, and as the pace quickens, the war commences as challenges are made, met and the massacre ensues as our film slowly introduces the viewer to the violence as Scorcese aims to condition the viewer - B.F. Skinner style. This is somewhat different than his other outings whereas in both 'Goodfellas' and 'Casino' Scorcese boldly introduces ultra-violence without the slightest amount of warning. In this film, Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) commences the war immediately as he slices and dices his way through the street enmeshed in a series of direct stab wounds yet no blood, but as he progresses and continues his assault, the knives are introduced as blood soaked, then the puncture wounds are accentuated as he pierces his way through flesh and finally we see his face saturated in the blood of others against the intentionally misplaced musical score of Howard Shore (The Lord of the Rings Trilogy).<br/><br/>This sets the tone for a film not aiming to please anyone or to alleviate the discourse of cinematic violence. It recreates a time when violence was rampant and for the purposes of storytelling, the violence quotient was necessary to give justice to the lewdness of the situation. Even women are not spared as Cameron Diaz portrays a charismatic pocket thief named Jennie Everdeane.<br/><br/>Despite her romantic engagement with Amsterdam, through her savage beating Scorcese displays no one was spared during the riots from the hands of predatory thieves who were vying to survive. Many have voiced criticism over the lengthy running time, and while many have stated there were segments which could have been trimmed, I disagree. At a running time of approximately two hours and forty minutes, the film recreates a piece of history sought with fragility and values conveyed to the viewer. People would give their lives for this war waged for the rights to claim ownership of NYC and it was of the utmost importance to develop that religious fanaticism closely. The characters in the film resemble heavily wrapped boxes, in which Scorcese allows to be unwrapped a little at a time; all the while he displays his prowess as a Director who astonishes with this film. For it is true the pacing was uneven at times, and the unraveling of the characters could have been sped up. But all of this is intentional in order to evoke a climax which represents their war between the Foreigners and the Anglo-Saxons in a city that had enough of its' riotous ways. While the violence will surely turn off Academy Members, Daniel Day Lewis' performance will not and this film will stand the true test of time as a story so unequivocally told it will remain indelibly etched in viewers minds long after the final sequence.  Transition shots display the evolution of New York City from a point of view of a tombstone nestled right under the Brooklyn Bridge. Cross dissolves start in 1863 and documents the changes from that exact point up until the time the Two Towers of NYC were standing. Perhaps reminding the world despite the progression of mankind, we are still not civilized.<br/><br/>

"MovieAddict2016","Null","20","32","8 July 2003"," Dr. Seuss' ""The Cat in the Hat,"" played by Daniel Day-Lewis...
","""Gangs of New York"" goes a lot of places but it never really goes where it should. It starts up slow, it gets slower, and ends really fast, too fast. For two and a half hours we are dragged through relentlessly gruelling scenes that pay no purpose to the film, and then the last ten minutes, the most vital point of the entire motion picture, the point where we are so hyped, pumped and ready for a big payoff, anything big, something big...fails. It quickly accelerates and ends with U2's award-winning song ""The Hands That Built America,"" and the fancy-schmancy, slow-to-fast credits start rolling.<br/><br/> There are a lot of problems with ""Gangs of NY."" I didn't hate the movie, but it let me down. Let me point out everything I didn't like.<br/><br/> Martin Scorsese, one of my all-time favorite film directors, the man who brought us the amazing ""Taxi Driver,"" the monumental ""Goodfellas,"" the excellent ""Casino,"" uses good, exciting camera techniques, with bright surroundings...but it feels like a reunion of ""West Side Story."" Everything is bright, dandy, happy, and things move from normal speed to super-speed, back to normal speed in a quick moment. It's like a mix between ""Chicago,"" ""Moulin Rouge,"" ""Romeo and Juliet"" (the DiCaprio version), and a really violent bloodbath-type movie.<br/><br/> In the beginning of the film, we are introduced to a pack of Irish emigrants, who live in ""The Five Points,"" or something like that. I've never really heard anything about this in history lectures, which is why Martin Scorsese said he was so interested in telling the story. Anyway, after a gruelling three-minute-something introduction to our characters, which just shows them walking in slow motion through an underground Irish-inhabitated craphole, we see Liam Neeson and Daniel Day-Lewis' character Bill the Butcher duke it out with their armies. Let me state here that another ""modern"" camera technique used in the film was one during the fight scenes. Scorsese lets us see the attacks, and then as the attacker kills his opponent the camera goes super-fast and starts playing some sort of odd rock music in the background, that actually resembles my quitar amp when I first flick it on and it crackles. Anyway, Neeson dies, his son sees it happen, his son grows up into (drum roll please)...Leonardo DiCaprio! Here's our first mistake. DiCaprio, who proved himself a fine actor all over again with ""Catch Me If You Can,"" one of his first films since that travesty ""The Beach,"" cannot speak with an Irish-New York accent if he wanted to. OK, no big deal, right? Right.<br/><br/> Next, Leo plans revenge on Butch Cassidy (woops, honest mistake) by becoming part of his clan, saving his life, and then trying to murder him. Unfortunately, old pal Henry Thomas (yeah, the kid from ""E.T."") rats him out, Bill the Butcher surprises Leo with a knife throw, and there-for-no-reason-except-for-the-male-teenaged-audience-to-come-see-the-mo vie Cameron Diaz screams and yells and eventually nurses Leo back to health, where he gets a band of Irish emigrants and plans his attack against Daniel Days-are-Loosened. (Was that a pun? I can't tell, I'm sure you can't, either.)<br/><br/> See how I summed that up in about one minute reading time? Translate that mess into a two and a half hour + film and you've got yourself the biggest flop since ""Waterworld."" Honestly, I have nothing against long films, AS LONG AS THEY HAVE AN INTERESTING STORY TO TELL WITH INTERESTING PROGRESSION. ""Braveheart,"" ""Titanic,"" all those two-VHS-tape movies have an interesting subject AND interesting progression, where things actually happen. Things don't happen much in ""GoNY,"" due to Martin Scorsese milking the subject for all it's worth. There is only so much known about that time period, only so much to imagine, and Scorsese tries to do both: Dilute facts with explosions and history with modern-day camera techniques. Scorsese is a great director, one of the best, but I try to imagine how he could not have done better given the fact he has been planning this film for years, to no prevail because of studios saying ""no."" Now I see why. They realized that this could make for an interesting hour and a half film, but 2 hr. 40 mins is just wayyyyyy too long for a film that goes nowhere.<br/><br/> There are some really good performances in this film. Well, by one actor, at least. Daniel Day-Lewis as The Cat in the Hat is really convincing as Bill the Butcher, save the fact that it looks as if Dr. Seuss designed his wardrobe. The always-sweet, always-pretty, always-enjoyable Cameron Diaz dresses up frizzy again, just like in ""Being John Malkovich,"" and tries to convince us her character is there for a reason, but simply put...well...she's just there for a love interest. It's really shallow and really quite pathetic. And Leo DiCaprio, the film's main star, who FINALLY proved to me with ""CMIYC"" that he was a great actor...just fails to capture the passion of his character, which he did in the much underrated ""Catch Me If You Can,"" where he had a real love for his character, and got inside Frank Abagnale's skin. He did not do so great here. In fact, Martin Scorsese said he wanted to make this film realistic. If so, casting DiCaprio was the worst possible choice, because since when did Irish emigrants have well-chiseled facial features and talk like Pierce Brosnan from ""Evelyn""?<br/><br/> ""Gangs of New York"" is a good film, but with so ensemble a cast, including John C. Reilly (who was in three Oscar-nominees this year) and Jim Broadbent, such a great director at the helm, so much hype, and so many years on the shelves, you'd think that the filmmakers would have had more time to make something great, and could have translated something a bit more interesting onto the screen. I'm not saying change the story. I'm saying shorten the length. ""Gods and Generals"" was an hour longer than this movie, and ten times worse, but I can't help but think that at least ""Gods and Generals"" tried to say something, and ""Gangs of New York"" did not.<br/><br/> 3/5 stars"
"sfmonkeyboy","1","63","117","4 August 2006"," overblown, overdone, under-interesting hype
","I waited for the DVD release before I saw this, and I was glad I did. The rental was a lot cheaper than a theater ticket would have been, and I was able to pause the DVD for a stretch break or a little walk when needed, which, sadly, was often. If a story line can catch your interest then the time can fly by, this story line was just so excessive and so overly violent and chock full of character quirks and craziness that time slogged on slow as a mouse in molasses. Other people have said similar, the characters were so despicable, disgusting, dehumanizing, that you really didn't give a rat's rear about any of them. There were one or two decent-to-good performances, but the rest of them you had to figure were cast for name value or because they had something on Scorcese that he didn't want made public. Potential spoiler --- when Leo DiCaprio gets his face slashed in the knife fight, so badly that he is truly horrible to look at, you never really see the supposed slash, and within a day or so he looks like he may have slept on a chenille bedspread and gotten a line or two on his face, but not the side-show ogre they would have had you believe. Was there too much concern that mar his pretty boy puss and the preteens will exit the theater? I think Leonardo has some definite talent (witness him in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"") but come on, he was slashed and stabbed in a knife fight, and in a day or two looks only as if someone had woken him early from his nap and he was a wee bit cranky. Scorcese -- you should be ashamed for this travesty."
"devinoneill-88065","7","3","3","22 March 2020"," Day Lewis is Stunning
","'Gangs of New York' is one of Scorsese's more inconsistent films, but it's still an adequately chaotic and thrilling tale of corruption and revenge. It's yet another sprawling story about the politics of organized crime in which no one can be trusted, loyalties are tested, and a whole lot of people die. But this time around, Scorsese swaps out the twentieth century mafia families moviegoers have grown accustomed to, for the brutal street gangs of Five Points in the 1860s. The performances are what really make the film, particularly Daniel Day Lewis, who delivers an expectedly electrifying take on the notorious gang leader Bill the Butcher. While there are some scenes I'm a bit iffy on, 'Gangs of New York' is generally another solid epic for Scorsese."

Sure, it is very bloody and pretty intense, but once you get used to the graphic violence then it reveals itself as a film of intense power and deep insight, not only into the lives of it's characters but about American history. The tagline is ""America was born in the streets"" and that is true. How the successful government that we now enjoy was created from the chaotic mess that was Civil War-era New York is beyond me. You don't hear about this chapter of American History much in school and I'm glad that I finally learned something about it. This movie is an extraordinary cinematic experience with great performances, especially by Daniel Day-Lewis, with amazing cinematography, and brilliant direction. Everyone should see this movie."

I reviewed it in recent days. Still, the perfect acting by Day-Lewis, Dicaprio and Diaz is worth all the trouble fumbling among the old discs (some may argue it should not be counted as an ""old movie""yet) and trekking all over again through a course of nearly 3 hours.<br/><br/>You have to give credit to the Great Martin Scorsese for his extraordinary ability of story counting and character selection. Reviving an old world is never easy, much less to say doing it in style. Once again the heritage of family spirit is fully embodied in his film. The sense of family honor and loyalty compelled young Amsterdam, after his graduation from university, to set out on an arduous journey of revenge. Of course, the audience will not only take delight in the completion of the Herculean task, but also savor each and every memorable episode all along the way."

But after that, the whole movie went downhill and was rendered totally forgettable and unwatchable.<br/><br/>After the murder, the storyline just dragged on to being totally pointless to where it no longer had a story. The final battle between Vallon and the Butcher was very impotent, like much of the action. Another case of big orchestra, little show. Where the trailer was only watchable part of the movie.<br/><br/>And Gangs of New York instead of being nominated for best picture, it made hell of a lot more sense to nominate it for the Rasperry award for worst picture.

With Leonardo scowling, Diaz giggling and Day Lewis doing his best De Niro, this film takes itself far too seriously for the leaden-handed and juvenile treatment of a story which seems suspect the moment you think about it.

","What can be said of a film where the best scenes were the few seconds at the end, where the New York skyline morphed from the slums of Five Points to the skyline pre September 11, 2001. <br/><br/>This film may appeal to those who want to see a violent blood bath set in grimy surroundings and played out by Hogarthian degenerates, but it is not in any way entertainment.  I kept waiting for Dante's Inferno to open up and swallow them into the fiery furnace.  The films plods unrelentingly through human misery and violence for more than two and a half hours.  Never once did I get the feeling that it may not be pleasant to watch, but at least it was raising my consciousness.  This was just a film of violence, blood lust and misery, as repulsive as Kurasawa's ""The Lower Depths"". <br/><br/>
I felt as if the director was making a film about depravity for the sake of depravity.  As if there should be a voiceover stating that ""In the Casbah/slums of Shanghai/Limehouse/Paris/Bombay every vice is catered to. Murder, drugs, vice, white slavery. No one asks questions, no one knows your name, you can hide or disappear, or make someone disappear.""  The opening voiceover from all those black and white films noire - Algiers, Shanghai Gesture, etc.  This is debauchery from the comfort of your cinema seat. <br/><br/>
Daniel Day-Lewis's ludicrous leering mustachioed Victorian melodrama villain robbed the film of any credibility and belonged to vaudeville. Far and away the only performance worth watching was Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed.  The overrated and unappealing Cameron Diaz and Leonardo diCaprio deserved each other.    <br/><br/>I can now understand why comedies and musicals did so well during the depression.  Some of us go to the cinema to be uplifted and entertained. There is beauty in the world if you want to look for it."

But, when you look at the body of work and more importantly the intelligence and multi-level approach of Scorcese's other films, this film completely fails in comparison.<br/><br/>Somewhere along the way this film was butchered, (pun intended) whether it was by the studio, by Scorcese, or by the batch of writers who's conflicting visions and machismo keep bobbing up and down throughout the story.  I believe Scorcese (or the studio) tried too hard to make a film for ""today's (young) audience"" instead of just making (or letting Scorcese make) a Scorcese film.  Sure, perhaps many of today's brainwashed and dumbed down proles might not get it, but the film would have entertained the large following this director has cultivated over his many years behind the camera.  If the only story he wanted to tell was a nobody wins revenge tale without redemption, flanked by an extremely shallow and cookie-cutter romance, then why waste all the time and money with 1860's New York? Whether or not Martin is actually washed up or still possesses his own magical abilities with a camera I cannot say, but it seems that whatever his original vision was, someone went through it (violently) with a cleaver.<br/><br/>It's interesting though, as a comparison, the actual base human story of ""Titanic"" has the same cookie-cutter romance elements as ""Gangs""  yet it is crystal clear that the FOCUS of ""Titanic"" is on an IMMACULATE portrayal of both the ship itself, the passengers, and the events that took place -- an accurate portrayal of history is the most important factor.  ""Gangs"" does not present that same sharp and exacting historical focus to any degree, instead bits of chopped up pseudo history and gruesome violence are thrown around for a bit color in an otherwise monochromatic, by the books, and boring love story.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I can hear this bomb falling right now...

I fear deeply not merely for the aesthetic judgement of the cinema-going public, but for its mental and moral health in receiving this dire, overlong, gratuitously violent farrago with anything less than utter derision.<br/><br/>The ""plot"" (I use the term not merely loosely but with something that would verge, unenclosed with the requisite scare quotes, as intellectual fraudulence) has been described elsewhere on IMDb, so I shall not attempt, even if such an attempt were either possible or worthwhile, to corral the disjointed episodes of Scorsese's free fantasia into a semblance of order. Scorsese's name itself has become a kind of Open Sesame into the acceptance of people who ought otherwise to know better. I was never a fan; even ""Taxi Driver"" seemed to me a kind of early essay in the pornography of violence that has now become the stock-in-trade of most Hollywood directors. At least ""Taxi Driver"" was technically accomplished: well-filmed, well-acted, well-edited. Beyond the moderately impressive set designs and the pyrotechnics that appeal to four-year-olds of all ages, ""Gangs of New York"" is not even an averagely well-made movie. As for the acting, Di Caprio runs the full gamut of his repertoire from A to B, while Day Lewis is a Victorian melodrama villain who, were he not terrorising hapless street urchins with his cutlery collection and unconvincing New York accent, would be better occupied tying young ladies to railway tracks in the path of approaching steam locomotives. (Anyone casting a live-action movie of ""Wacky Races"" need look no further for Dick Dastardly!)<br/><br/>There is no editing, no discipline, no sense of internal form or tempo; there is ""just one damn thing after another"". These damn things are violence, violence, gratuitous sex and more violence. There is no serious attempt to build character, nor any sociopolitical analysis of the immiseration of the various tribes of the Five Points beyond the sentimental exoneration of anyone who is not white, Anglo-Saxon, male, heterosexual and Protestant, and the vilification and calumniation of anyone who is. Straight WASP male - Boo!<br/><br/>At the height of the draft riots I was reminded briefly of a far better movie: bloated WASP (boo!) David Hemmings's attempts to maintain a stiff upper-lip as his grand residence was besieged was a sillier re-run of the scene in ""Carry On Up The Khyber"", where the Raj feign indifference during ""tiffin"" to the invading natives.<br/><br/>A rotten movie that glorifies anarchy and senseless violence.

Neeson's son grows up to be Leonard DeCaprio and when he returns to Five Points he his taken under the wing of Day-Lewis, until his identity is revealed. Cameron Diaz is around here somewhere, swishing through bar rooms, half-built churches, and underground caves. <br/><br/>Another street battle is arranged. Coincidentally it takes place during the historic draft riots of the Civil War period. Day-Lewis is killed by DeCaprio, and the feud is buried.<br/><br/>I couldn't tell one gang from another but I loved their names. They are rooted in historical reality, I think, and they include not just the Dead Rabbits but the Chichesters, the Bowery Boys, and the Plug Uglies. The Plug Uglies derive their name, I understand, from a ""volunteer fireman's group."" There were thirty-seven such groups. There being no fire department to speak of at the time, volunteer groups were paid by the fire, which led to the expected results. Not only competition by rival groups to reach the fire first, but sometimes co-opting the fire by having a handful sit on the fire plugs and reserving them for their own group. (Arson by the firemen themselves also generated profits.)<br/><br/>That's the kind of detail that Scorsese jimmies into this movie. We get to see some historical figures, such as Boss Tweed, and we witness their machinations. But the director's real interests lie elsewhere -- intrigues among the gang members and their molls, revenge, murders, public assassinations, things like that. I know. It sounds like the Corleone family. Unfortunately that's probably the weakest part of the film. There is usually a great sense of ""place"" and ""tribe"" in Scorsese's work. The Five-Points set is splendidly done but I couldn't get a sense of what was where. Transitions from exteriors to interiors, and the relation of community features to each other, were confusing. And although Day-Lewis's character was nicely delineated, and our attitude towards him necessarily ambivalent, I wasn't itching for DeCaprio to off him and stand victorious over his body -- which is part of the gangs' code. (""Ears and noses are alright, but nobody touches this body!"" That's another order from Day-Lewis about taking post-battle trophies. Another guy gets paid by the new notches he carves into his sheleghly or whatever it is.) Nobody in the film is entirely admirable, although just about everyone is treacherous. A black orphanage is burned down during the draft riots but this eludes mention. Also, okay, this is about the poorest and most crime-ridden neighborhood in New York City. Day-Lewis is a butcher and Cameron Diaz is a hooker, but what kind of work do the others do? We don't see anyone making a living. We don't even hear them talk about it. To whom does Day-Lewis sell his lamb chops?<br/><br/>None of that detracts from the power of the images we see on the screen, or from some of the superb performances, the least effective of which come from DeCaprio and Diaz. The film paints a moving portrait of near anarchy. We only get to see one or two cops and they're thoroughly corrupt. Nobody balks, no committee is formed to investigate, when a battle between street gangs leaves dozens dead. The street has its own code. Plus ca change."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","6","8","4 September 2006"," ""It's a funny feeling being taken under the wings of a dragon  it's warmer than you think.""
","So narrates Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) standing by the boss Bill the Butcher's side (Daniel Day-Lewis) at the height of his hard-boiled reign over New York City in the mid-1800's. Amsterdam saw the Butcher brutally kill his father in a gang-war when he was just a little boy, and he's sworn revenge ever since. But in order to get his vengeance, he must infiltrate the Butcher's gang, and ends up becoming something of a son to him.<br/><br/>That ""Gangs of New York"" is such a good film is a mystery because it breaks the fundamental rule of good film-making: you have to care for the central character, and DiCaprio's Amsterdam is an unlikeable young man. He is surly and unkind, walking around in a bubble of hesitation and scattered thoughts of revenge. He moodily snarls at the one woman he likes (Cameron Diaz). It is inconceivable how someone as dynamic, likable and strong as the Butcher would ever take this brat in, but that's film for you.<br/><br/>The above is an unfortunate miss; the lead character has to be strong or else the film will weigh him down. Juxtaposing Dicaprio with Day-Lewis has got to be the worst idea that's ever popped into Scorsese's mind because it is evident within minutes of the film that they are of very different acting fibre and the former will look even WORSE when paired with one of the best working actors in the world today. But these are mere casting flaws (but still harmful), so onto the overall direction:<br/><br/>A friend of mine once said that Martin Scorsese is only capable of half a film before it turns into a mess and that stuck with me when I watched ""Gangs of New York"", because it was true. This is a relatively straightforward story of revenge but it is diluted by detours in Irish traditions  there's singing, dancing, bareknuckled fighting, drinking and debauchery--for 2 and a half hours. These detours may be well sewn-together by a patient Scorsese narrative flow (I'm thinking ""Casino"") told by Amsterdam, but is unnecessary to go to such lengths to get the Irish-immigrant setting and mood. We already got it, so move on and give us more substance.<br/><br/>However it cannot be denied that many of these detours make the film and setting  they are beautifully illustrated by lush colours that seem to bleed off screenprimary colours to suit primary, instinct-driven and hard-boiled men. The cinematography is just staggering. New York City is gritty, corrupt, bloody and bare-knuckled. I mean, I have seen Tarantino, Stone, Kramer and Cronenberg but this is by far the most violent and gory film I have ever watched. Such poignant, effective fights.<br/><br/>It is a shame the rest of the film is not as poignant, but desperately diluted. What saves it is Day-Lewis' magnificent presence on-screen as the brutal Butcher Bill, the occasional portrayals of gang-culture and the almost all-star ensemble cast that pop up in supporting roles throughout. A good film (just barely), but nothing more. ""7"" may be too generous, but hey...<br/><br/>7/10"

","Dialogue, anyone? Or perhaps people are satisfied that 90% of this movie contained lines such as, ""ARRRRGGGHHH!!"", ""AHHHHHH!!"" and ""ROOOOOOAR!"" And the real treat: 500 different ways to see sharp objects inserted into a human body! I don't care about extreme use of violence for the sake of art (or just good old fashioned entertainment!), but in Gangs of New York the violence neither furthers the plot nor makes us care about any of the characters. After viewing this movie I am left with the feeling that I have seen some crappy teen slasher film, only this time the characters wore period costumes and, instead of 90 minutes, the movie went on for 3 hours. However, if you cut out all the bludgeon/stabbing scenes, then this movie would only have 15 minutes worth of plot/ideas to work with, so I suppose the ""filler"" was necessary."

","Along with so many people, I had waited for this movie to come out, but for a different reason. I have studied the Five Points at great length and wanted to see how Scorcese would deal with the subject. I was never more disappointed than when I left the theater after this drivel.<br/><br/>The storyline was okay if it stuck to the story. However, the action went in too many directions. But to an amateur historian, the fallacies are far too glaring. Fights between gangs were not agreed to in some formal setting, they just happened. And no one ever agrees to not use firearms...they were too frequently used. The Draft Riots were not central to the Five Points...the neighborhood had actually started to improve by the Civil War. By then, the Irish already controlled the Points and simply ignored the natives. The worst riot was in 1857, when the Bowery Boys' Riot flared up and left over 100 dead. The actual Bill the Butcher was a bit different from this one. William Tweed did not ascend to the head of Tammany until after the Draft Riots...<br/><br/>I could go on and on. Read Tyler Anbinder's ""Five Points"" or selections from ""Gotham"" to get a more accurate picture of the period."
"ulyses","6","8","12","4 September 2006"," Not the worst movie I have seen, but it is over-rated
","I am the first to admit that I had doubts about this movie before I saw it. Hollywood never does well with a story ""based"" on historical fact. After seeing it, my fears were not allayed, even though the film is shot well and the acting was above average.<br/><br/>My main problem is the story itself. New York during the civil war was bad enough without having to embellish the story. Contrary to the theme of this movie, most of the rioting was caused by immigrants who resented the loss of jobs to freed slaves or feared would cause their wages to fall. Most of the violence was against blacks, including the burning of an orphanage and the killing and lynching of any unfortunate black caught on the streets.<br/><br/>This is definitely liberal Hollywood's view of history. It may be interesting, but it definitely isn't factual. Also, all the slobbering about how great Daniel Day Lewis is in this character is over-rated. His is the kind of brutal, troubled character that doesn't appeal to me.<br/><br/>See this movie if you want. Remember it is fiction of the worst kind."
"Sepsis","1","41","84","25 June 2003"," Are You Kidding Me?!
","Are you kidding me? This film was nominated for Oscars? Of all the junk over the years that has been nominated and has won Oscars this has got to be one of the worst yet! First of all is the actors; Leonardo DiCaprio has no business ever playing a tough guy kind of role. DiCaprio is so girlish that he is laughable as anyone who would be in a knife fight and should stick to roles where he plays either gay character or someone who is just very fem. DiCaprio seems right at home in a sappy love story such as Titanic or as a mentally handicapped person such as his role in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. As if Leon wasn't bad enough we have to deal with 166 minutes of Daniel Day-Lewis looking like a bum and acting like a confused mime. I can't think of a movie where an actor or actress has failed more miserably in a part as Daniel Day-Lewis did in this movie; he was in a word, Laughable. Now as if the two main characters failing so utterly was not enough there are several other things which make this movie near unbearable. Of this list the first thing that comes to mind is the silly costumes which although somewhat authentic for the period were over-done and seen far too much. An example of this was the ten-gallon hats. Yes, people wore them back then but in this movie almost everyone had one on which would be like someone 140 years from now making a movie which takes place in 2003 and the same percentage of people as were wearing ten-gallon hats in this movie were wearing baseball caps. The next most annoying thing about Gangs of New York was the music; the same perpetual square dancing music played over and over again as if they just couldn't come up with something better. Moving right along we come to another very annoying `feature' . the accents done by DiCaprio and Day-Lewis, neither of which sounded anything like they should; aren't actors by definition supposed to, well, ACT?! Let's face it here people, if Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't in this movie along with Scorsese directing it, but rather had an unknown set of lead actors and actresses with an unknown director orchestrating this whole farce, this movie not only would have never gotten a single Oscar nomination but probably would have went directly to cable or video. The only upside to this whole fiasco was perhaps the cinematography and the story. This movie had a lot going for it but was ultimately doomed by the bad acting, poor casting, hilarious costume design, annoying music and boat load of other things that sank this ship before it ever left the harbor . 3 out of 10 stars for this catastrophic calamity."
"Kashmir-4","1","17","31","6 January 2003"," A Mixed Bag
","Most veteran movie-goers should by now be very wary of films with a huge Oscar publicity machine, especially those brimming with ""buzz"" so long before the movie is anywhere near theatrical release.  This is such a movie. I was wary, but I kept an open mind because it was a Scorcese film, and sometimes his directing ability has the uncanny power to avert cynicism from his film.<br/><br/>I call this film a mixed bag for the following reason: It has one really good performance (plus a few others that were okay), good directing, and okay cinematography but a very, very poor script - and that script hurts a lot of the film.<br/><br/>It should be obvious by now that Daniel Day Lewis's performance as William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting is the one I'm referring to - if anyone deserves an Oscar for their acting in this movie, it's him.  Everyone else more or less does exactly what the script requires them to do.  Liam Neeson did quite well for his brief role as ""Priest"" Vallon and Brendan Gleeson did a good job as McGuinn, a quiet subdued role for the only character to see through young Vallon's disguise.<br/><br/>The stinker in this movie is the script.  First off, what is this movie?  Is it a revenge drama?  A romance story?  A period political piece?  It never decides - it cannot.  Instead the script meanders through each of these possible threads and picks up and leaves off where it wishes.  This lack of focus sometimes lets you stop caring about some of the characters (and I'm not really spoiling anything, but the ending practically forces you to). Also, the backstory of the beginning scene is never given, so I'm still confused as to why the movie ended up where it did.  I chalk that up to a bad script that's in a hurry to tell the story.<br/><br/>Scorsese at least has done his job in directing in his usual, reliable way. I forgive him the two very obvious uses of artistic metaphor in visualization: the ""blood on the blade"" and the bible falling into the water.  He deserves an Oscar at some point, but I'm afraid it shouldn't be for ""Gangs of New York"".  He has done better, and will do better in the future.<br/><br/>The last thing I have to nit about is the cinematography.  I think it was vastly overrated.  Most of the scenery felt confined to one area, like all the action took place just in the actual spot of the five points. Manhattan seems like a much larger place than the one we saw in the movie."

","I had to watch this movie for a history project and was not expecting to be very entertained, but I was very surprised. The characters are all very unique and no one is at all boring. Daniel Day-Lewis' character of Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting is the highlight of this film. He is not a good guy, but Day-Lewis plays him so well that you can not help but focus on him in a scene. This movie gives insight into the Draft Riots in New York and all the gang violence in the Five Points district. Leonardo DiCaprio's character, Amsterdam Vallon, is a young man driven by the murder of his father. He is the main character and he narrates the movie. His father had belonged to a prominent gang but due to his death the gang disbanded. There are now several gangs that occupy the Five Point district of New York and this causes a lot of violence. This movie shows the violence between these gangs and shows Amsterdam's journey of revenge against Day-Lewis' character. This movie has it all, violence, drama, action, romance, and even a bit of comedy. I will not spoil anything so I will end with this, it is a very good movie and worth the watch :)"

With an utterly incoherent story and dreadful acting from all but Day Lewis this was more reminiscent of The Muppets Take Manhattan than Goodfellas.

","Daniel Day-Lewis plays a Bill Sykes-send up with a truly laughable makeup job and an accent that's as carefree as the wind. You never really know why he hates Irish immigrants so much (a mere generation away from being an immigrant himself), and you never understand why everyone in The Five Points slum is so loyal toward and protective of him when he does absolutely nothing to alleviate the poverty and squalor of their senseless, miserable lives. (Oh yeah, since his legitimate front is as a butcher, he occasionally throws a decent steak their way.) Don't get me started on Cameron Diaz, The Whore With The Heart of Gold (because THAT's a story that hasn't been told enough) who, inexplicably is the only character in the movie with clean teeth. Liam Neeson, who croaks before the end of the first reel, is one lucky bastard.<br/><br/>After the first 20 minutes, of course, anyone not watching the movie in Braille understands perfectly what the one and only dramatic issue is going to be (REVENGE!!) and you can step out for Chinese while the movie drags its ass toward its inevitable and tedious conclusion. Granted, *Gangs* might have made some use of the obvious Shakespearean themes, but Scorsese doesn't even try to handle them. Thus, though you might entertain a flicker of interest in the Hamletesque question of whether the son will avenge the father, you wind up so bored w/DiCaprio that you don't freakin' care anymore by the time he gets around to doing the deed (which is rather done for him before he even bothers to show up).<br/><br/>In fact, though Leonardo keeps staring out at you from that bland little face and trying to convince you that he's struggling with Complex Moral Issues, the fact is: Every single person in this movie is reprehensible and evil, with differences in degree but never in kind. And if there are no good guys, why are you supposed to be cheering at the climactic scene when (for about the 11th time) the streets yet again run gooey w/blood and body parts? And yet, Scorsese tries. Toward the end of the movie, he picks up the nearest blunt instrument and bashes away at the plot until he's grafted an obvious hero (DiCaprio) and an irrelevant hetero love story (DiCaprio and Diaz) onto it. In other words, Martin Scorsese has nothing but contempt for you. You're too stupid to realize that DiCaprio's character is a venal, murderous little crook and you'll be mollified by a pretty romance between him and a sociopathic pickpocket prostitute. Because the history of America began between the sheets.<br/><br/>This is the movie you'd get if Oliver Stone and Hannibal Lecter collaborated on an American history epic, and it's about as cynical a piece of trash as I hope never again to see."

","There's this director called Martin Scorsese, okay, he's really good with camera placement - his movies always look hip & trendy - plus he's a not untalented director of actors. He usea lots of pop music & his movies are usually full of the kind of excessively bloody violence & profanity strewn dialogue that delights the teen crowd. This combination has so far proved persuasive enough to elevate him into the Top 10 lists of 'The World's Greatest Directors' courtesy of hip, trendy mags like Empire. Fair enough. Unfortunately what this acclaimed director cannot do is deliver a coherent, well told story about characters we actually take to heart. Case in point - Gangs of New York, aka another example of Scorsese's shockingly inept storytelling.<br/><br/>Seriously, what is the story in GoNY about? The film is thematically incoherent & badly structured. It wanders from an initial revenge set up between DiCaprio's Dad and Day-Lewis's baddie to scenes involving immigration, the draft, local politics, racism and corruption. Some of this is sporadically interesting but none of it coheres into anything meaningful so that when the end finally arrives the viewer is left with a 'Huh, is that it?' feeling (and it must be conceded that a similar sense of frustration attends the ending of almost every other movie from this overrated director). <br/><br/>Even the performances are dreadful. Leonardo DiCaprio is simply miscast in a heroic role for which he does not possess the required presence. Whenever this guy is on screen you can feel your eyes sliding away in the direction of whatever else is going on in the frame. As Bill the Butcher, Day-Lewis blows DiCaprio off the screen & yet he's the villain! Word of advice, Marty: when you're trying to make an audience empathise with your protagonist's near three hour quest for revenge it's really not a good idea to make your villain approx 100 times more charismatic & interesting than your hero.<br/><br/>Okay, let's cut the crap. Gangs of New York is a mess & its heavy handed marketing by Miramax, which secured it 11 Academy Award nominations, received swift and well deserved justice when it won precisely ... none."

The final sequence where we zoom into a The Butcher's glass eye and its revealed that its an eagle was trite and clichéd.  IN the end, the only redeeming factor of the film is Daniel Day Lewis.  He gives Bill the Butcher, depth and comic verve that insert much needed life into the proceedings.  Whenever his character's is on screen his completely steals the film.  Perhaps this makes the film all the more terrible.  If only his brilliant performance was in a film more deserving of it.  Martin Scorcese, you haven't just created a blunder, bad a travesty to cinema and an injustice to the history and citizens of New York. Shame on you!"

","In the bloody backdrop of 19th century gang wars, Leonardo DiCaprio (as Amsterdam Vallon) seeks revenge against dastardly Daniel Day-Lewis (as Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting), who killed his father. As a boy, Mr. DiCaprio witnessed his father being murdered by Mr. Day-Lewis. After fifteen or sixteen years, DiCaprio returns to New York City's ""Five Points"" neighborhood, and infiltrates Day-Lewis's organization, actually becoming Day-Lewis' apprentice. While waiting to avenge his father's death, DiCaprio falls in love with slutty pickpocket Cameron Diaz (Jenny Everdeane), who counts Day-Lewis among her bed partners.<br/><br/>The DVD sleeve reminds, ""This motion picture event from acclaimed director Martin Scorsese earned 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor, along with 5 Golden Globe Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress and Best Song! Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis star in this epic tale of vengeance and survival!"" Only one of those nominations resulted in an award; Mr. Scorsese got a ""Golden Globe"" for directing. But, Day-Lewis's barnstorming supporting role won several other ""Best Actor"" awards.<br/><br/>Scorsese's well-produced (and very brightly lighted) picture's theme really comes into focus during the last few minutes - that the immigrant ""Gangs of New York"" were the foundations of Manhattan, New York, and (by extension) the United States. Or, ""America was born in the streets."" The ending is where the film is at its most powerful.<br/><br/>Before that, the movie is about DiCaprio's ""Amsterdam"" and how his priestly father was replaced by Day-Lewis' ""Butcher"", during an orgy of violence. With his knife, Day-Lewis has ""intercourse"" with the priest. He hangs is picture, and adoringly recalls, ""He was the only man I ever killed worth remembering."" Although he adds, ""I never had a son,"" Day-Lewis does treat DiCaprio like his ""born"" son. Many other interesting characters appear during the long running time, but they aren't developed enough to give ""Gangs of New York"" the epic sweep so obviously intended.<br/><br/>****** Gangs of New York (12/9/02) Martin Scorsese ~ Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, John C.

","As a big fan and great respecter of Martin Scorsese, counting Taxi<br/><br/>Driver, Mean Streets, The King of Comedy, and The Last<br/><br/>Temptation of Christ among my alltime favorite films (sorry,<br/><br/>Raging Bull), I looked forward to Gangs of New York with huge<br/><br/>anticipation. I have to say I was let down.<br/><br/>The story was a typical tale of revenge and love, wrapped around<br/><br/>the political happenings during the early years of New York City.<br/><br/>Sounds interesting. Unfortunately, it wasn't.<br/><br/>The problem for me, primarily, was one of character development.<br/><br/>There was no change in any of the characters throughout the<br/><br/>movie. William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) represented the old<br/><br/>guard, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) represented the<br/><br/>new, and Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) was the political figure<br/><br/>who was really in command of the situation.<br/><br/>None of these characters grew at all during the movie. Cutting was<br/><br/>a believer in rule by violence right up to the end. Vallon was bent<br/><br/>on revenging his father's death, his only true motivation throughout<br/><br/>the film. Boss Tweed was a typical politician, playing both sides,<br/><br/>depending on which looked like the right horse at the time.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Broadbent did a great job as Boss Tweed, and<br/><br/>the smaller supporting roles were quite well done. Daniel<br/><br/>Day-Lewis was outstanding as Cutting, but his weird accent was<br/><br/>distracting right from the beginning. You may try to make an<br/><br/>argument that it was true to the time (which I doubt can be proven),<br/><br/>but to my ear it was quite false. DiCaprio suffered the same accent<br/><br/>problem, but, even worse, his screentime with Cameron Diaz was<br/><br/>much less than sizzling.<br/><br/>Another problem: I couldn't buy Diaz and DiCaprio together at all.  I<br/><br/>guess maybe Diaz seems too old to play the role.  While they are<br/><br/>not that far apart agewise in reality, in the movie they were both<br/><br/>supposed to be around 21 or so, and Diaz just couldn't pull it off. I<br/><br/>may be imagining that, but I can say this for sure: Diaz and<br/><br/>DiCaprio had no chemistry at all.<br/><br/>In essence, Gangs of New York is quite a boring film. The story is<br/><br/>interesting, that this is really the story of the formation of New York<br/><br/>City, but as cinema, it falls very short of the greatness attributed to<br/><br/>it. I can give it only 3 stars out of 10. Sorry, Mr. Scorsese."
"Angeneer","7","13","24","16 April 2006"," Fantastic direction, extremely weak story
","Watching Gangs of New York makes you feel that so much effort has been put for nothing. An absolutely top class direction by Scorcese and a memorable performance by Daniel Day Lewis, for, well, a plain and uninteresting story. It is hardly believable that they accepted contributing their immense talents having to deal with such a weak scenario. My only guess is that, this movie being shot right after the 9/11 events, they would have considered it as a tribute to the city of New York and they just had to be there. So about this excuse of a script: The tension is not built, the lines are poor and nothing is actually happening the right way.<br/><br/>Now Leo Di Caprio. Who thought putting him against Day Lewis? The difference in class is so huge, one cannot think of them as adversaries even for one second. Daniel owns this film, while Di Caprio barely surfaces. And of course Cameron Diaz doesn't need to even be mentioned at all. Completely indifferent.<br/><br/>Gangs of NY is the definition of a missed opportunity. With a proper script and a better lead instead of Di Caprio, it could be so much better."
"JMichaelAtchue","7","2","2","1 May 2020"," See it for DDL
","Watching ""Gangs of New York"" again, I was awestruck by the power of Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as Bill the Butcher - the flawless accent, terrifying rage, and shrewd intelligence combine to create a villain unlike any other that I've seen. Had the studio campaigned for Day-Lewis to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor, rather than Best Leading Actor, at the 2003 Oscars he likely would've won. And not only is DDL perfect as Bill Cutting but the storyline centered around him is fascinating, focusing on a dynamic slice of American history rarely given the Hollywood treatment: the so-called ""Nativist"" reaction against Irish immigrants and the 1863 New York draft riots. As a descendant of Irish-American immigrants, this aspect of the movie hit home for me as it showcased the bigotry that the Irish had to overcome before finding their place in America.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Bill Cutting plays only a supporting role in a movie cluttered with various storylines and side characters that don't fit together. The real protagonist is Amsterdam Vallon, played by Leo DiCaprio, who is on a quest for revenge against Bill because he killed his father. But that storyline takes a backseat to a cliched love triangle between Bill, Amsterdam, and a pickpocket named Jenny. And THAT storyline is overshadowed by a subplot involving the underhanded dealings of political boss William Tweed, and then that aspect of the film is sidelined in favor of another political thread focusing on the 1863 draft riots.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie's nearly three hour running time, it shifts breathlessly between these elements without fully developing any one of them. The result is an often messy film that struggles to find a compelling story to tell. Never before have I been bored by a Scorsese movie, but in this instance I just wasn't interested in what was happening throughout the majority of the film because so much of it seemed underdeveloped and unnecessary to the overall plot. Scorsese would've done better to focus exclusively on Bill Cutting and the draft riots, rather than undermine what could've been a great movie with superfluous side characters and subplots. So I recommend watching ""Gangs of New York"" for Day-Lewis, but keep in mind that it's not one of Scorsese's better movies. 7/10."

","With Gangs of New York, we begin to see Scorsese getting comfortable with his position as a visionary director, in the case where he isn't taking as many risks as he used to with films such as Taxi Driver, Last Temptation of Christ, or King of Comedy, amongst others. The story of this film isn't innovative to be exact, nor did I really expect it to be. It's a rather standard revenge story.<br/><br/>And there's nothing particularly wrong with the revenge story, as it's created some truly fantastic works such as Django Unchained, Mad Max, John Wick, The Count of Monte Christo, and many other great works of literature, film, and art, though some might say after a while that the revenge story has become tired, and I am one of those people who can only take revenge stories for so long before I call it a day. I suppose the main issue that I have with this film is that is isn't as dangerous, nor as powerful as some of Scorsese's other works, and it's a film that would seem to be below what Scorsese would usually take, and it's not something that usually is a part of his style, but luckily the film isn't all bad.<br/><br/>The film is saved from mediocrity by two things, one is the stellar direction from Scorsese, who directs the film with the eye of a grizzled veteran showing the new kids on the block how a film should be done, few shots are wasted and the setting and atmosphere of the film also lends itself to be admired. Second are the main performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio, respectively. I could write an entire book about the talent that is Daniel Day-Lewis, who I not only think is possibly one of the finest actors of our age, but one who should be in the same league as other heavyweights such as Brando or Bogart. Rarely have I ever seen Daniel Day-Lewis portray a character, but to completely disappear into a role, which he does almost effortlessly with Bill The Butcher in this film. Rarely in the film does Day-Lewis not steal the show with his electrifying performance as the title villain, giving him a likability despite his depraved and vile acts and making him almost sympathetic at times as well. The other major powerhouse performance is from the film's other major star Leonardo DiCaprio, who while I can't usher the same praise as I can to Day-Lewis, I also think gives a magnificent performance in the movie, while he doesn't completely disappear into his role as he would in some of his later performances, but I did buy him as a street wise, tough kid who wants to settle some old scores. The ending of the film is also praise-worthy, as is sneaks in a subtle, yet powerful message about how time moves on from us and how, at the end of the day, the thirst for revenge and power ultimately is a futile goal to reach.<br/><br/>The flaws of the film are as apparent as the praise-worthy aspects of it, the rest of the performances of this film I could take or leave, they range from mediocre to passable, especially with the appearances from Cameron Diaz and John C. Reilly of all people, I suppose I might be judging too harshly since the central performances of the film are so engrossing and rousing. There could be the excuse that when you're confronted with greatness, you're overtaken with insecurity and you don't know what to do, but I don't know. Luckily, the more mediocre performances of the movie don't entirely take you out of the experience of the story, and the characters are still likeable despite some of their more stilted moments, though conversely, Brandon Gleason, on a positive note gives a rather overlooked, yet gifted performance, despite his minor role in the film.<br/><br/>One of Scorsese's masterworks, I wouldn't call this film. But it is still a damn good one, and watching it simply for Daniel Day-Lewis also makes it into a damn good time."

The movie gave viewers the opportunity to think about America and the people living in it prior to the country becoming what it is today. Personally, I had not been aware of how large an aspect of life gangs played in major cities in the US. It is quite a long movie at almost 3 hours, so some parts could get a bit boring to some viewers, but as a whole, the movie is well made. The casting was done very well, the actors portrayed their characters accurately. Leonardo DiCaprio was a strong choice for the lead and showed his incredible acting abilities.

","Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) and William `The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) are the two central characters in Gangs of New York. Amsterdam lost his father in fight between the Irish immigrants and the Native Americans (who are not American Indians). During the opening battle scene (which plays, unfortunately, as if it were directed by some MTV rookie), Bill the Butcher takes the life of `Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson). Only a young boy, Amsterdam is sent away to a reform school where he anxiously awaits the chance to take revenge.<br/><br/>The movie picks up in 1863 as an older Amsterdam returns to the savagely impoverished Five Points area of Manhattan. He immediately begins to seek out Bill the Butcher in order to exact revenge. It is this period of the movie that is the best. Amsterdam is still a young man, albeit a hardened young man. Through necessity, he makes friends with some of the most unlikely people and we are left to make our own assumptions of some individuals' motives. Amsterdam meets Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) and their relationship during this period of the movie is brilliant.<br/><br/>
Gangs of New York takes a turn for the worse in the third act. Instead of continuing to focus on the intricate character relationships that it so masterfully and carefully setup through the first 2 acts, the movie decides to become a historical drama centering on the Draft Riots. While the Draft Riots are an important and mostly forgotten piece of history, the audience has invested too much time into the existing micro-relationships for the movie to simply push them into the backseat. The events leading up the riots had always been in the background of Gangs and I was comfortable with them there.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully filmed for the most part. As mentioned above, the opening fight sequence was strange and had an MTV quality that initially left a bad taste in my mouth. Fortunately, Scorcese finds a tone and style that remains effective and, in some sequences, is almost brilliantly conceived. All of the actors here are superb and, if you can get past Leonard DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz as 19th century hooligans, you will enjoy their performances much more. The real star here, however, is Daniel Day-Lewis. He is not playing Bill the Butcher, the man is Bill the Butcher. He plays Bill with such an intensity, I never once questioned his existence. The music in the film is hardly anything special and works effectively where it needs to accentuate emotion. The set design and costume work is top-notch.<br/><br/>Overall, Gangs of New York is a welcome addition to my collection as it should be in yours. The shift in focus is unsettling, but does not diminish the accomplishments of the revenge story in the long run. The movie would have worked either a straight character drama or a historical drama about the Draft Riots. It does not, however, completely flow as both. Each of the parts of the film are exciting in their own rights but only succeeded in distracting one part from the other. Scorcese has crafted a fine tale and, while not the masterpiece or even Best Picture candidate it was touted as, Gangs of New York is a very good film."
"slokes","2","14","27","17 December 2005"," John Jakes On Acid
","""Gangs Of New York"" feels as much of a labor to watch as it was to make, and considering the fact we are being paid considerably less for our part than director Martin Scorsese was for his, that's a problem.<br/><br/>There's the potential for something good here, a fictional take on life in the hard streets of Manhattan during the Civil War, but the film never delivers. Instead, it serves up bloody chunks of exposition and characters with lines that are meant to sound profound but come off clumsy. ""The blood stays on the blade,"" a young boy's father explains in the opening moments, after he cuts himself shaving and the boy starts to wipe the razor clean. Why? Is he so sentimental about shaving cuts? Does he not know a bloody razor will rust much faster and become useless, even dangerous, for shaving over time?<br/><br/>When the boy grows into a man, he becomes Leonardo DiCaprio, who seems to have undergone a physical metamorphosis from the sallow-cheeked lad of ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" to bloated rodent-man of Arch Hall Jr. proportions. I never understood the mania for DiCaprio, either pro or con. He's a serviceable actor who gets a lot of big parts though the consensus seems to agree he was better when younger. Here, his post-pubescent woodenness is evident as his Amsterdam Vallon character is forced to double as clunky narrator (""New York loved William Tweed... and hated him, but for those of us trying to be thieves, we couldn't help but admire him."") and put through his paces too quickly for air.<br/><br/>What air there is is sucked up by Daniel Day-Lewis's overripe performance as Bill Cutting, the greasy-haired nativist butcher with the Snidely Whiplash 'stache. Day-Lewis definitely gives off a lot of energy, but he's also all over the place, the most out-of-control performer in a Scorsese film including Richard Manuel in ""The Last Waltz."" One minute he's denouncing the Irish with a zealous scorn, the next he's taking young Amsterdam into his embrace. For a guy who hates the Irish so much, Bill sure spends a lot of time with them.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz fights with DiCaprio in delivering the least convincing Irish accent, really lost at sea though I blame Scorsese and the screenwriters more than her. Too many other minor characters are used too obviously as plot devices, explaining how things are as a way of moving a bloated story along. The film bites off way more than it can or should chew, wanting to show not only the nasty environs of Five Points but the machinations of Tammany Hall and assorted figures of the day. Boss Tweed is wedged into the storyline very roughly, as is Horace Greeley and P.T. Barnum.<br/><br/>I was reminded in the end of John Jakes and the historical fiction he was popular for when I was growing up. Young man arriving in a strange American city, meeting famous people from history books while making friends and enemies of uncommon intensity. Simpler fare for a simpler time, yes, but there was something entertaining in the way it was done. Here, one gets a lot of blood and violence, some sex, sketchy attempts at humor, much emoting, and absolutely zero fun."

","As a fan of many Scorsese films, this came as a big let down. Apart from Lewis, most of the cast was unconvincing. The script was messy, and was let down by so much happening in a short space of time after a long / slow / boring, build up.<br/><br/>This isn't as good as the classic Scorsese films. There are actually many annoying features in the films, such as the inappropriate music and the stereo-typing of Irish people.<br/><br/>Ultimately I found the film confusing, and couldn't see what Scorsese was actually trying to tell us. I was left unconvinced as to how important these gangs were to the birth of New York. The major turning point in the film, actually had very little to do with the gangs, and seemed to be the more important moment in the history of New York.<br/><br/>If he was trying to impress us with the colourful characters in the gangs, well the film fails on that count as well.

There's just nothing interesting about Gangs of New York at all. The only reason anyone would like it is if they convince themselves that it is somehow ""artsy"" because it is unconventional. Even though ""artsy"" doesn't mean it is a good movie, smug people like to think they are ""cultured"" so they automatically associate ""artsy"" with ""good movie"".

DiCaprio has been a bad actor from the beginning of his career. This movie shows that. He does not play a character that is believable in the least.<br/><br/>The only good part in this movie was the beginning battle scene with Liam Neeson.

","I don't care who directed it, this movie sucked. The acting is terrible, the characters aren't beleivable at all, the storylines and main points of this movie aren't imaginative, their just stupid and ridiculous, in fact the only good part in this movie is the actual historical facts (which have nothing to do with the storyline, and aren't exactely diffacult to do whatever you want with seeing as it was a friggen riot). First on the acting, De Caprio still is just as bad as he was in Titanic, unbeleivable, inconvincing and overall, he doesn't come off as 'badass' he comes of as just being an paumpus ass. He's supposed to be Irish but he continualy slips in and out of accent. Cameron Diaz should stay in the stupid pop-culture movies because her 'blonde cheerleader' acting style obviously is way out of place in this movie set in the 1860's. And Lewis as 'Bill the Butcher' just comes off as a jerk, not as the leader of the 'Native American' party during the war (which are badly represented since although they were politically active group, they were not a common street gang, which makes sense since they hated both the Irish and the blacks, why would they have to hang around in the slums?). Now for the story, it starts off somewhat interesting with the battle between obviously persecuted Irish and some other unknown group (which since you don't know they're the 'Native' party yet, makes the fact ok). But in this scene, the main character Amsterdam is an 8 year old, and not Leo. But then the time warp happens and it's 16 years later, enter Leo. The storylines don't display the chaotic and desperate struggle between natives of New York, Irish immigrants from the potato famine and freshly freed slaves, struggling for jobs, food and houses. Where there was scuffles and fights, they were random and not organized, gangs were small and primarily nothing more than names of small groups of teens, rather than the personality and colorful differences in the movie. Lastly, this movie shows an organized slum of gangs who meet at conferences to plan fights, this is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. And to top it all of, for about 30 minutes this is a friggen porno, bubes, sex and whores which is obviously there to distract from the fact that there are 10 second pauses in between each line!

","Not a shred of humanity shines through in this film to rescue it from being one of the most unpleasant cinematic experiences of recent years. Some say, ""but it's Scorcese"", afraid to consider that the master may have taken a misstep, and ready to admire his pet project on the basis of previous triumphs. I'm afraid I'm going to have to disagree. For highly stylised characterisation, read ""pantomine villains"", for impressive design, read ""an overwrought and unconvincing pastiche"", for a captivating plot, read ""a relentless barrage of violence, punctuated by the annoying musings of unsympathetic characters, none of whom arouse any sympathy"".<br/><br/>I have no problem with violence in films, especially of the sort shown here. That is, brutal, unsettling and far more likely to make one a pacifist than a violent man. Usually, however, the violence is countered by the humanity shining through in at least one of the central characters. The only character capable of arousing pity and sympathy is this film is that of Cameron Diaz (under-used). Others, especially Di Caprio (as Amsterdam Vallon), simply arouse frustration, annoyance and contempt (are we suppose to respect this disturbed young man's violent revenge fantasy?).<br/><br/>
The only plus note is the (historically accurate) incorporation of the anti-emancipation riots and lynchings of black men in New York during the Civil War into the plot. There have been few American films recently to show the ugly side of America's formation and I'll give the film a cautious plaudit for that at least."

The tribes of the city are summoned for the mother of all knock down drag out duels with the Butcher and Amsterdam intent on slaying the other.<br/><br/>The scenes of 1840s and 1860s New York City are awesome. Great photography and camera work. The most dramatic scene is of the blood covered and body cluttered snow at the film's beginning. This of course seems tame compared to the carnage that brings this epic to a close. Day-Lewis is commanding in his role of the Butcher, one the most egotistical and racist savage characters unable to escape your memory. DiCaprio seems an awkward choice for his role and at times seems unlikely to achieve his character's accomplishments. Diaz was down right fetching and I still believe she could tempt a dead man. Also in the cast are Jim Broadbent, Brendan Gleeson, David Hemmings, Joseph P. Reidy, Henry Thomas and John C. Reilly.<br/><br/>
Sometimes a little bit too wordy and slow, but still this almost three hour film is strong enough to hold your interest and imagination. In spite of the nay-sayers I believe Scorcese is a master among his peers. And being Irish is no requirement for feeling some pride or sorrow."

","This film is compelling. It also catches the viewer off guard. At first, it begins to build itself as your average son-of-killed-man- gets-revenge-years-later plot line. Then it completely throws the viewer off, thereby creating very deeply emotional characters. They feel like they are real as more information is revealed. There is also no shortage of intrigue. It might begin to feel as though the film is too long, but when it is over the entire picture comes together and one sees exactly why it was played out the way it was. Most of the cast is brilliant; the accents are slight but noticeable enough to be believable. Each performance is gritty and well done. Daniel Day Lewis and DiCaprio play off each other beautifully- they're both excellent actors and could have easily over-performed one another, but it can be perfectly understood that Scorsese directed them well. Each main character's story has a purpose that makes sense and doesn't feel unnecessary. It is true, however, that many of the supporting cast is forgettable(mainly because they look very similar and are only seen once or twice), though the film tries hard to make you care about them when they die. And there is a lot of death in this film, specifically killing. When the word ""gangs"" is in the title, that's obvious. The film also does a great job of showing the plight of civil-war era Americans who were affected by the first draft, showing facts that not many remember these days. The end is sure to tug on your thoughts for sure, and it leaves the viewer pondering everything from America's history to the meaning of loyalty. Very well done."

","I'm not exactly sure whether this should have been a film or a mini-series, either way, I am left with the felling that I've missed something. Yes, there where great actors, a great director, props, costumes, so on and so forth... but where is the glue that holds it all together? At a distance, it is the story of a boy seeking vengeance for the murder of his father and the inhumane treatment of his countrymen, yet it is also about war, racism, poverty, romance, and the list just goes on and on. I understand the significance of all of these factors, but I want vengeance. Did I want to watch two and a half hours of him climbing up the social ladder, just to fall all the way off, then two seconds of vengeful fury? Not really.<br/><br/>It is the kind of film that a remote control was made for. I am not saying at all that it was bad, I just lost interest. Yes, anticipation is what the audience needs to so they will be captivated, but when the story is all over the place and the original plot gets lost in the mix, it's just disappointing. I also have to ask, what happened to the countrymen? That was the cause that his father gave his life for, so why isn't as equally important to the son? Of course he had to shame the Irish to get close to the enemy, but there were no personal signs that he even cared about his countrymen, save for a mumble here or there and a donation to a homeless man. It lacked the spirit and enthusiasm to go with the overall drama and action."

","I was eleven when this film came out. Of course, I couldn't see it, but I still managed to book tickets for my dad to go, as a late birthday present. When I asked him what he thought, he said that it was brilliant. Since then, I have been incredibly eager to see it.<br/><br/>I finally saw it a year ago, and was amazed. Gangs of New York is a film with a grand sense of scale and spectacle, the incredibly detailed sets and props all portraying a corrupted and immoral world of gangs, riots, racism and other large issues of the time.<br/><br/>In fact, Gangs of New York sometimes tries to handle a bit too much, with the many issues all battling for decent screen time, along with the film's revenge-driven main plot. It is not necessarily a bad point about the film, but it would have been nice if Scorsese had tackled fewer sub plots. Sometimes, you can be a bit too epic. Also, as a result of this, some characters don't feel as developed as they should be (such as Johnny, a friend of one of the lead characters who eventually turns into a traitor).<br/><br/>However, these are the only flaws that I can see throughout Gangs of New York. Eager to give the New York setting as much detail as humanly possible, the production crew has created something truly memorable. Every street feels authentic, every costume feels infected by the time in which the film is set and most of the characters feel individual.<br/><br/>Of course, when it comes to the authenticity of the characters, the praise should largely go to the actors portraying them. The supporting cast is brilliant, with actors such as Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson and Jim Broadbent delivering great work in sometimes truncated roles. Broadbent particularly deserves applause for his terrifically entertaining performance as a corrupt politician who is only interested in one thing; winning.<br/><br/>As for the leads, they are also fine. Leonardo DiCaprio delivers an emotionally credible performance as a man seeking revenge for the death of his father (as depicted in the film's opening and gruesomely stunning battle sequence) whilst Cameron Diaz is also mature enough to convince the audience of her character's plight. However, all of the other actors cower under the rip-roaring force of one Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis fully captures the audience's attention from the opening onwards, eliciting brute force along with an unstoppable love for America. He is one of those murderers who the audience can't help but be drawn to, and performs with such passion that his character is utterly believable. His portrayal quivers with power, most notably in the scene where he describes the power of fear in a bedside discussion with DiCaprio's Amsterdam. It is an exceptionally grand performance, and will certainly not be forgotten by myself for a long time.<br/><br/>Steven Zaillian's script is expertly written, never shying away from the nasty side of the story. People are killed with cleavers without their murderer ever even flinching. A policeman is strangled and strung up for everyone to see his corpse. A man is forced to kill his friend. This isn't a very nice story, and Zaillian complements the fact with nasty yet human dialogue, which sounds like it has been spewed from the depths of the character's condemned soul. He also provides some fine pieces of humour, which aren't out of place in the film's bloody plot, yet provide some relief from the almost never-ending slaughter.<br/><br/>Conducting all of the blood and guts is Scorsese. As I said before, he sometimes tries to add too many subplots into the mix, but overall, his direction is superb. He crafts the film with great skill and intelligence, rewarding the more expectant viewers instead of mocking them. Also, even though some of the subplots aren't really handled successfully, there are moments of pure perfection when Scorsese manages to mix in the main story with other events.<br/><br/>As Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis) march away after a confrontation with Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent), the camera pans away to a group of immigrants who have just landed in New York. They are immediately being sent to fight in the Civil War, and are boarding a ship sailing for the battlefield. As they are boarding the ship, coffins containing dead soldiers are being shipped over their heads into the harbour. This is an exceptional shot, one which shows the indifference of the Americans in the face of the suffering which has been endured by the immigrants. These people sail to America in search of a better life, and in return, they get sent to die.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York may be flawed, but it doesn't let its bad points drag it down. Scorsese keeps everything moving nicely, right up to the bloody depiction of the Draft Riots. Here, Scorsese can be seen at his best, releasing pure, bloodthirsty pandemonium as people storm the streets murdering and pillaging, whilst always keeping his eyes on the central characters and their plight. Another excellent moment takes place in this period of the film. When the police close in on the rioters, the rioters become trapped. They are ordered to break up, but they don't. There is one second of intense silence, then the police open fire. The result is a violent and graphic bloodbath, with Howard Shore's tremendously passionate score pounding in the background. It is a truly gripping and poetic moment in the film, and is deeply moving.<br/><br/>At the end of it all, Gangs may have its flaws, but they don't stop it from having a huge impact on its audience. It is moving, tragic, passionate and heroic, and is outstandingly presided over by Martin Scorsese and Daniel Day-Lewis. It was a tremendously challenging film to make, but it has been made with a huge amount of creativity, brains and heart."
"reese-22","7","3","4","5 January 2005"," Memorable enough yet flawed.
","This was the first Scorsese movie I ever saw and at first I thought Gangs of New York to be a masterpiece. Since viewing Scorsese's superior earlier works (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull etc) my feelings about Gangs of New York have changed somewhat.<br/><br/>One of the films major flaws is its casting of Leonardo Dicaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio appears to be trying incredibly hard in his lead role, yet he still looks to clean cut and boyish to be taking on the role of a New York Gangster. Cameron Diaz is feisty and does her job in an apt enough fashion but the only memorable performance in the movie comes from Daniel Day-Lewis. He excels as the ruthless Bill the Butcher and he turns the aggressive notch down in his compassionate speech about his troubled upbringing. Where Gangs of New York goes down slightly in my estimations is in its execution. Too many minor and in the end insignificant characters are introduced instead of there being development to other characters such as Diaz's Jenny Everdeane.<br/><br/>All said and done though ""Gangs"" is a highly entertaining movie with well executed, brutal fight scenes, lavish set and costume design and an acting masterclass from Daniel Day-Lewis."
"dunmore_ego","8","3","4","2 December 2004"," An Army Of One - Daniel Day-Lewis
","There are three reasons to watch Martin Scorcese's superlative Gangs Of New York:<br/><br/>Daniel.<br/><br/>Day.<br/><br/>Lewis.<br/><br/>Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, Al Pacino as Tony Montana, Gary Oldman as Sid Vicious, Val Kilmer as Doc Holliday and (to wax more 'modern') Hugh Jackman as Wolverine: iconic performances, one and all. Day-Lewis joins this pantheon of Actors who made acting choices that so transformed them into these particular icons that one is hard-pressed to see the 'star' beneath the role, even in retrospect. <br/><br/>Over the years, in his diversity of roles, Day-Lewis has insidiously placed himself amongst an elite few who have the right to actually term themselves 'actors' in this 'excrementitious' business which has degenerated into a forum for 'movie stars' (people with correct hair and au courant clothes designers).<br/><br/>Day-Lewis' role of Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting personified the age-old saw that any villain's character is infinitely more interesting than any hero's character. This movie's hero being played by Leo The Fluff did not help any. The only way Fluff could ever be Hard is if he became Tim Roth. I concede that he is a very good actor  he's been doing it since he was 5, fer cryin' out loud  and he's honed his craft into that of a nascent Hollywood Legend (yet he has 'miles to go before he sleeps' on the laurels of a lip-smacking role or major award), but his insipid chick-flickable role in ""Titanic"" created that taste of sulfur in my mouth (and I'm guessing in the mouths of many others who might have marvelled at his turns in Basketball Diaries and This Boy's Life) to the point where he must almost martyr himself to engender any real 'likeability'. (Next summer: The Passion Of The Fluff.)<br/><br/>In a film stocked with excellent actors (Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson, Fluff, Jim Broadbent, Henry Thomas  and no, Cameron Diaz, is NOT one of those excellent actors, she's no better or worse than any one of a thousand women who could've filled that role), Day-Lewis molds a larger-than-history persona that illustrates the fact that Acting isn't really as easy as we all think it is. We are shown  by an absolute MASTER of the craft  how it's REALLY done: the force of will to forge this unique embodiment of power; abrasive, ambitious, ruthless, loyal; the choices of movement, accent, attire; each inflection, each flourish - Grand Gesture  not a smirk out of place, not a twirl of the mustache unintentional. <br/><br/>This movie's plot is almost an afterthought, as Day-Lewis' scene-stealing is so complete that we simply live for and unto each moment he graces us with his being... Set against the cyclorama of political machinations which defined early New York City's cultural eclecticism, an iron-fisted tyrant (Day-Lewis) must deal with crooked politicians (are there any other type?) threatening to usurp his power over a swathe of borough known as the Five Points, as well as deal with Leonardo DiCaprio (playing the son of a former civil leader whom Bill executed personally in a street battle - a cameo'd Liam Neeson), seeking vengeance for his father's death. <br/><br/>It was refreshing to learn that this movie's plot did not hinge on the ubiquitous device of Woman as the focal point. Even in movies that purport explosive grandeur, such as that displayed in Gangs, original storyline is so frequently sacrificed to the age-old struggle of acquiring a woman from a) another guy, b) another lifestyle, c) another tax bracket. Jenny (Cameron Diaz) intimates that she is Bill The Butcher's woman, yet after she sleeps with Fluff and we see that Bill is not in the least perturbed (but rather embraces an avuncular pleasure in knowing that his surrogate son has gotten some), Jenny loses all her importance to the tale; we, as jaded viewers, were grimacing and gearing up to see yet another testosterone-induced stag-battle over the meaningless mannequin of Woman  but it did not occur!  to the movie's great credit. It lent yet another dimension to the enigma, the legend, the inexplicable conundrum that was Bill The Butcher - that IS Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>Brings the bile to my throat to think that those talentless drogues on Melrose Place share the same earth as this genius; that while Day-Lewis has wrought such a world-shaking role as this, there still exists on this stinking planet Poison Ivy II and Friday The 13th Part VII, and ANY of the twenty incarnations of Police Academy dung heaps. In a world made better by Daniel Day-Lewis, should there be any reason to keep Steve Guttenberg alive?<br/><br/>Were it not for Daniel Day-Lewis, Gangs of New York would be merely a 'great' film, scourged from the engine-pit of misbegotten pseudo-history and sand-blasted onto the epic screen - but with Day-Lewis' incendiary performance of Bill Cutting, this film rightfully earns the mantle of 'classic'.<br/><br/>(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"

DiCaprio has one expression [glowering] that he uses throughout the entire film. Cameron Diaz is fine, though she doesn't have a great deal to do. Daniel Day-Lewis is indeed marvelous, but although I'm a big fan of his I wish I hadn't seen this movie. Go watch In the Name of the Father again if you need a fix.<br/><br/>When the militia put down the rioting immigrants, all you can feel is relief -- they lost all our sympathy when they murdered and lynched innocent people. Scorcese appears to think we will still feel for the irish gangs by showing the rich of the city as power hungry hypocritical bigots. He fails.

","This one has some powerful shots -- the crane shot after the opening battle is pure Breughel and the final series of dissolves (spoiler!) in which the City rises across the river as the graveyard where 'Butcher' is buried becomes a vacant lot is potent. But Amsterdam, unlike Hamlet, is not given enough to do. Hamlet, we recall, puts on a play in which he gives himself away, then decides not to kill Claudius at prayer. Amsterdam just drifts and Leonardo is the victim of many motiveless feet of film. The film, then, is only intermittently telling a story of revenge. Is it telling the story of Tweed's and ""Butcher's"" alternative views of politics? Now-and-then. Is it telling the story of the buildup to the Draft Riots? That narrative begins somewhere during the second half, and there's a nice juxtaposition between Irish soldiers going to Shiloh and the coffins lined up on the dock. Is it telling the story of Amsterdam's conversion back to Catholicism? That seems to happen, but why? And, of course, Diaz drifts across the landscape, also with a bundle of vaguely conflicting motives. So -- the film, like so much current filmmaking, is incoherent. And for all of post-modernism's embrace of disjunction as a value, that does not make for a satisfying artistic experience."
"Doylenf","Null","4","6","26 July 2003"," Impressive Scorsese epic marred by excessive bloodlust...
","Production-wise this is a richly produced epic of old New York focusing on gang rivalry in lower Manhattan circa 1860s, and the production values can't be faulted. Photography is expertly crafted, the main performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is excellent (as a bloodthirsty villain called Billy the Butcher), and it is obvious that a great deal of research and historical detail was done to give credence to the story. <br/><br/>Having said all that, the story could have been trimmed by at least an hour with some of the most graphic battle footage eliminated--and the effect would have been only slightly less startling. But Martin Scorsese has chosen to give the story a three hour running time to tell what is basically a tale of revenge that did not have to be amplified to include all of the bloated footage left in the final cut.<br/><br/>It's clearly a film of murderous excesses and I can understand why the Academy chose not to give it the Best Picture Oscar.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing in his intense portrayal of The Butcher. Cameron Diaz as the ""heroine"" seems to have a modern day look no matter what period she's supposed to be emoting in--and Leonardo DiCaprio is only semi-successful in his approach to the role of the avenging son of Liam Neeson. His accent comes and goes with each scene and is especially ""gone"" whenever he narrates parts of the tale. Both he and Diaz are clearly more at home in modern roles. Additionally, a more rugged looking actor would have suited the role better.<br/><br/>But, as stated before, the main flaw is the excessive butchery which is bad enough in the opening scene where DiCaprio's father is dispensed with by the Butcher. After that, every so often, the camera lovingly captures scenes of mutilation and killing, lovingly capturing every thrust of a knife. For a film of three hours length, it is all too much.<br/><br/>Most of the performances surrounding the leads are excellent but one in particular stands out--Henry Thomas as Johnny Sirocco who meets a cruel death in the hands of The Butcher. It's hard to believe this is the same ""little boy"" from E.T. He's excellent all the way through and should be commanding the screen in leading roles.<br/><br/>Summing up: What could have been a great film is marred by excessive violence. There is indeed still such a thing as ""overkill"" and it's too bad Martin Scorsese never gets the message."
"bzb2001","3","10","20","4 January 2005"," Scorsese's Mess
","Watching a bad film is always a chore. Watching a bad film that runs nearly three hours can test the patience. Yet watching a bad film created by one of our cinematic geniuses is just plain tragedy.<br/><br/>There are elements of Gangs of New York that remind us of Martin Scorsese the master. We remember the blood-drenched rope during Raging Bull, or the violent stabbing of a gangster in Goodfellas. Gangs of New York has plenty of blood, that is for sure, but none of the violence is tethered to anything worthy like in Scorsese's other works.<br/><br/>A violent film for the sake of being violent should be judged on its own merits, not based on the merits of the person creating it. I understand much of what Scorsese was trying to tell in the picture, but it just does not work. The film is set in the backdrop of the Civil War. As the nation is warring with itself to set an identity, so are the people of the five points in New York City.<br/><br/>After his father (Liam Neeson) is murdered sixteen years previous, Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the five points and seeks vengeance. The murderer is one Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) whose power was considerable then, but has grown to total dominance now. Amsterdam slips into Bill's lair as a young student of violence and mischief.<br/><br/>Along the way we meet Tammany Hall's classic corrupt politician William ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent) as well as the police corruption of ""Happy"" Jack Mulraney (John C. Reilly). We visit a pickpocket (Cameron Diaz) who is the love interest of Amsterdam and his friend Johnny (Henry Thomas). All of these characters add a certain voyeuristic quality, but we don't care about any of them or their motives throughout the plot. We peek into the wealthy of New York along with the poor. And finally the city explodes when the government enlists a draft primarily on the poor New Yorkers and immigrants, since those with $300 (a fortune then) are able to buy themselves out of war.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis received many awards and critical acclaim for his performance. I felt it was overdone and overwrought. DiCaprio was fine along with some others, but the truest revelation is Cameron Diaz. I have never been as impressed with her as I was here, standing up high against formidable acting opponents. In general the critical consensus was favorable, likely due to Socrsese's previous excellence. That the film more or less tanked at the box office does not surprise me for the reasons listed above.<br/><br/>Given what is wrong with the film (and there is a lot), it is not a total failure. Scorsese has appeared on talk shows praising the ""hands that built America"" that came from New York during this time. Though I disagree that is what the movie is ""about,"" I did enjoy a critical look at the treatment of immigrants. Those are the ""hands"" I would refer to as the builders, not these violent gang members fighting over the very worst the nation could offer. For a more detailed and much more entertaining look at this time and these issues watch Ric Burns' ""New York: A Documentary Film."" A scholar notes that the immigrants (mostly Irish at the time) gave much more to our country than we gave to them. Sad but very true. *.5 out of ****"

","As a young kid Leonardo DiCaprio's sees his dad killed by Daniel Day- Lewis in a street squabble between immigrants of all feathers and the natives. Not the Indian natives mind you, but those white dudes born and raised in the US from fathers who stole the country from those other natives a few generations before, as opposed to all the immigrants that come over from Europe and want their share of prosperity there and then. Get of my property! So DiCaprio swears to do Day-Lewis in when he has grown up. The movie then fast forwards sixteen years into the future to come to a halt around the time of the civil war. We learn that Leonardo's desire to kill Day-Lewis has not dampened yet and he learned all kinds of usual skills that help progress him and society towards a better one.Of course not: he just knows how to kill people with a knife.<br/><br/>Perhaps the movie has some deeper meaning by showing how utter vapid the life of Di Caprio is as it is solely geared towards one violent goal. If he is to represent the Irish immigrants that came to eek out an existence it is lost on me. Blame me for not getting it.<br/><br/>The next two hours then might see interesting things about the historical background of the US in the late 19th century or even about the life of the immigrants, but nope.. it is all about a gang of criminals. The kind that plague society any time in any setting and is filled with thugs, hoodlums, scumbags, crooks, sadists and profiteers and anyone else preying on other people. But perhaps that was the message?The US is made by criminals?<br/><br/>It takes DiCaprio around two hours to do in Day-Lewis, which he could have done by gunning the guy down in the first 15 minutes, but nope, he needs to linger because of reasons. Moral ones. DiCaprio shows nothing redeemable and what I see is a person who has thrown away his life and sense by wanting to destroy another for nothing but revenge. No noble goal is guiding him. It is just bloody revenge.Get a life dude! There is some kind of romancing going on between him and Cameron Diaz, which is probably in there just to extend the movie even further for it feels like they just go through the motions. Diaz is a unlikable as the others, only she is female, so maybe that is her excuse.<br/><br/>For my life I can't figure out why anyone would sit through this movie that has such unlikable lurid characters. Perhaps the acting is great, but really, why would you watch two hours of bloody violence, an awkward romance and nothing else? There is another movie about gangs called the Godfather, which is also about a group of criminals and also about immigrants. It has drama, character building and other things going for it. This movie just can't compare to it. It is almost as if Scorsese wanted to redo the Godfather in another time, like a precursor, but simply lacks the quality of writing to help him tell the tale. Perhaps Scorsese might have given Shakespeare a try by turning it into a west side story kind of thing, but it has nothing of the love story, nothing of the sad tale. It is just a boring movie about one guy wanting to do in another and taking two hours to do it."

However it looks like the Catholic Church has gone medivel because the Church is represented here by Leanardo's Dad who seems to be encouraging everyone towards ultra-violence. He is the Stoic Priest who is strangely leading everyone including his child to a nasty brutal gang fight (with every sharp instrument you can think of) behind the banner of some rabbit skins.

Instead we have people totally dying ( with little blood loss) - or Totally fine and tireless. Then to add further insult to endless injury the snow turns out to be cotton wool. Pause it and see for yourself! I am not kidding. These Hard Oirishmen are fighting on soft cotton wool! <br/><br/>Inevitably the invincible DDL kills Leonardo's dad and automatically the fight stops. Bear in mind this is a pre-arranged fight that the priest wants his son to see. The arranged fight ends with great drama and civility with DDL paying much respect to the fallen Liam. he even asks for the son to be educated! Yet the son still seeks revenge? The Son ends up in a Orphanage type home where they teach him to do nothing but grimace and a little kung Fu. <br/><br/>All this time we are subjected to well dodgy Oirish accents and music. It was getting a bit much. Then when Cameron Diaz started speaking with such an obviously fake accent - I switched off. It was now too much.

"marohius","1","7","14","9 July 2003"," As bad as it gets
","This is one really bad movie. Unless you enjoy mindless and tasteless gore as entertainment, do not waste your time watching this.<br/><br/>The ridiculous tone as the movie is set during the opening sequence where emotionless children watch their parents being literally butchered. It carries on up to the final battle, where Amsterdam's last stab triggers a geyser of blood that sprays Di Caprio from head to toe. In between, the movie is a terribly boring collection of predictable, useless and at times completely wasted violence. The overload of violence completely fails to grip you as it is defeated by countless details that make it pathetically unbelievable - like Di Caprio's fresh skin two scenes after having is face marked with a red hot iron. There is no comfort to find in the razor thin plot, which is unveiled in the first minutes, nor in the characters, who are all competing for a spot on the bottom step of the morality ladder, nor in the dialogs, which are empty.<br/><br/>I watched this movie until the end hoping that it would at some point generate some emotions, but it didn't. The movie actually gets surprisingly worse towards then end when the historical events of the draft insurrection are slapped on like a slide show as to compensate for the lack of plot. The only thing that gripped me until the end was my amazement at how poor all of this was.<br/><br/>It is amazing indeed to think that $100M were spent to realize such a piece of garbage. And it is even more amazing that Hollywood dares to present this to us as entertainment and profit from it. It is a shame for the Academy Awards to have nominated this film 10 times. It is a shame for Mr. Scorcese to have wasted such a great subject and such great acting talent."

My husband I walked out of the theatre wondering, what was that all about?<br/><br/>I could forgive, (Oh, I really can't) that it is historically inaccurate, but this film doesn't even rate as fiction.  It is a simple straight forward revenge story.  DiCaprio is horribly miscast.  What's the matter?  No Irish actors?  That role needed someone like Colin Farrel, but that would not have improved the plot.  There was the silly love story that we could have totally done without.<br/><br/>This is where I depart from others, I think Day-Lewis was more than just over the top.  His character should have been named Snidely Whiplash.

The acting, the script, the editing, the sets, everything.<br/><br/>A lot of people mention DDL acting as brilliant, when in fact all he does is overact a very unbelievable character.  I don't see too much skill in that. In fact his whole character, like all the characters in this film, are very poorly developed.  In reality no one is just bad and no one is just good. DDL's one dimensional character is just portrayed as nasty.<br/><br/>The story itself, what little is there, is a presented in such a claustrophobic manner.  None the of sets look realistic, it always feels like a studio set.  Even though I know it was made on a huge back lot. <br/><br/>
One theme that bothered me was this simplistic racism in the movie.  The Irish were good, the Irish liked black people, etc, where as everyone else was evil and racist.<br/><br/>I'm sure in the time period that murder and suffering were common place, but I'm also sure compassion and caring existed to some degree, surely even in those times there was some form of law. <br/><br/>Overall a mess of a film, it had no punch, no direction, poor acting and no real story of mention."

","A good friend of mine recommended this movie to me, since we are both in History at University I thought I would give it a shot.  The beginning of the movie I was really interested, filled with action and a sense of revenge for the main character.  However, it just started going downhill from there. I found that there were too many useless characters that brought little or no addition to the plot.  Most of the film was filled with uninteresting dialog and plot twists.  In all honesty, this movie should not have been over 2 hours long.  I just found that there were too many scenes that needed to be shortened and get to the point.  Overall, Gangs of New York seemed to drag on and on.  While the cast was excellent and the acting was amazing the story was just awful.  After the first hour of the film, I found myself not connecting with the characters, hence became extremely boring.  Films which are pushing a 3 hour time span should keep the audience entertained with character development, action, and story.  However Gangs of New York seemed to fail at all of these except boring the heck out of me.  I would much rather watch Pearl Harbor than Gangs of New York."

","Gangs of New York is a very violent movie. This makes sense because it takes place during the Civil War. There was a lot of disunity during this time as well as racism. Clearly, no one wanted to be drafted and blacks didn't have rights yet. Just be sure to know that there is a lot of blood and gore. At the same time, it is also a love story. While the two characters who fall in love do fall in love, they also find themselves mortified of where they live. Another thing to pay attention to were the flashbacks. They were one of the most helpful parts off the movie. They help the watcher get an idea of who some of the characters are from the beginning through the main character's eyes. Speaking of the beginning, I also suggest that you mute the TV until you see the battlefield. I had to watch this part a couple of times, because of errors on my computer, and the music will make your ears bleed. Don't worry though because you will get to hear it later. Actually all of the music was terrible but you only had to hear it once."

The history lesson we get from this movie is very thin, and the cheap drama, especially with love interest Cameron Diaz, doesn't divert the attention from all the flaws of the movie. It should have been Scorsese's magnum opus, but apparently Harvey Weinstein and the likes had Marty's balls in a vice, and the movie came out disorganized, hampered and tiresome. That's why I give it a 3 out of 10, although i'd like to give Marty a 6 for trying the best he could in these times. And we all know he CAN do it."

","In my opinion, this was an amazing film. I highly recommend a second viewing to fully appreciate it. I've heard complaints that it was too long, but the detail that went into this film could not have been achieved in a shorter amount of time. It does contain quite a bit of violence, which I usually hate, but the director leaves most of the gore in the minds of the viewer and not in the eyes. The history of New York and the draft riots is basically unknown to most Americans and this film details this history very bluntly.  No sugar coating. The blatant corruption of government authority and the underlying essence of the role religion played, (and is still playing in our time), and the problems and prejudices facing Americans is all too familiar more than a century later.  From the costumes to the architecture, to the leaders and their subjects, Scorsese's vision, his life's work, is finally realized and presented to the public as a spectacle and a reflection of just how much New York has changed and yet is still a part of our lives. The ending scene, where we see the change of New York over time and the cemetary across the Hudson just sort of ""reminding"" us of what once was, brought tears to my eyes and grief to my soul.  Not necessarily ""grief"" because of sadness.  It was more of the grief one can feel from just moving on to someplace new and yet never really letting go of where they've been."

","I finally got past the bad vibes I've had about this movie and went to see it today.  I cleared my head and watched it in an empty theater. <br/><br/>
Not since I forced myself through the full version of Heaven's Gate have I struggled harder just to get through a film without committing the full trifecta of falling asleep, laughing at things not intended to be funny and fighting to stay afloat on a sea of suffocating boredom.<br/><br/>Finally, the third act collapses under the weight of too many half-baked ideas and a simple plot resolution that should have come an hour earlier - all concerning characters I cared for about the same as I care about my neighbor's monthly water bill.  <br/><br/>What a gigantic waste.  Ugly, unappealing, unoriginal, predictable to the nth degree and a beautiful spring day down the drain.  A few months ago I thought The Two Towers was flawed.  Compared to this catastrophe it's The Godfather, Part II.  <br/><br/>Cameron Diaz has been the mark of disaster for me in 2002.  Until now, I thought The Sweetest Thing was the worst film of the year.  Now I'm not so sure.  At least The Sweetest Thing isn't nauseatingly full of itself and knows fairly well what a dungheap it is.  <br/><br/>As for Day-Lewis, he was ok but not remarkable.  Over the top and two-dimensional.  About five times he seemed to be trying his best wacky-DeNiro.<br/><br/>Well, allow me to put another notch on MY club: Scorsese hasn't made a decent film since 1990.  He is apparently washed up (a 13 year slump? that's someone else's whole career!).  <br/><br/>Maybe there is hope: I thought Polanski was washed up, too. <br/><br/>

","What is it with film directors that they cannot produce consistently good work once fame and reverence goes to their head? Scorsese is considered the greatest US filmmaker still active (by all those who don't think so of Spielberg). Much like his endlessly-feuding, barbaric, mid-19th century New Yorkers, the man seems to have worn his welcome in history, and what a sad, sad realization that is.<br/><br/>His masterpieces (""Mean Streets"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas""), will always remain such, and hopefully endure in the annals of cinema. But why, why such travesty?<br/><br/>Abandoning his unique style in favor of a concoction between ""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Braveheart"" (with a bit of ""The Postman"" thrown in for good measure), Scorsese, in his apparent eagerness to catch up to the 21st century, seems to have adopted the worst traits of modern moviemaking. The next step in this witches' brew of a film is assembling the most familliar and tired screenwriting cliches, grinding them, stirring them to a boil, and then pouring them out onto the screen. Add to that a haphazard, sluggish editing, which may or may not be the result of Scorsese's battle with Miramax. Then some generic actors who clearly look uncomfortable and not even very significant before such a gigantic ego. Construct a post-apocalyptic looking set, and include a CGI(!) elephant stampede during the climax. Shall I even continue?<br/><br/>GONY's underlying themes are even more dubious and incomprehensible - what are we supposed to make of the primitive stab at Civil-War America's social/ethnic urban politics? Vengeance, religion, parenthood, and yes, democracy - are distilled to a comic-book level.<br/><br/>What has happened to the master who in his heyday created such dynamic, urgent, intoxicating (and subtle, in their own inimitable fashion) character studies? After seeing this grandiose folly, one wishes that Scorsese would have taken a graceful exit, and retired or stuck to film preservation. Bergman, for example, has not made a feature film in almost 20 years, and that makes him no less great..."

It was Christian principles and the selfless toil of missionaries and churches that ended the sorts of human depravity that did take place in that time and place, despite the ever present contrary behavior of those who call themselves Christian yet live as pigs and dogs.  Viewers are not expected to know the difference. Women are helpless and good even when they are whores, thieves, and murderers.<br/><br/>All of the characters in this movie are cowards, except when they fight each other.  It's okay to be a coward as long as one is also a savage.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an historical film, this one is too focused on petty barbarism to give a worthwhile sense of life in early New York City, and awfully slanted to support the director's obtuse views.

First I'd like to say that Daneil Day Lewis played his role perfect. He did so good in his role as the butcher that I cannot imagine any another actor in that role (Really). I also liked the surreal, Dirty,Brutal,Gritty old 19th century New York City setting..I though the sets were fantastic. The Special effects were pretty standard(which means pretty good these days), and Liam Neeson was also very convincing as the boys father,too bad that his character was only in the movie for about the first 15 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>However what hurt this film is that it is way too long, and you almost feel like the director is trying to drag it out further with a series of scenes that have little or no bearing on the story. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio were the way wrong choices for this film. I remember thinking to myself as I was watching it that Colin Farrell or Ewan McGregor would've been much more better suited for the role of Anstredam than DiCaprio was. And Diaz is much too much of a modern California girl to star in this period film set in 19th century New York City and it shows. Again I found myself recasting that role to Kristen Dunst or Heather Graham who I believe would've been for better in that role than Diaz. Neither Diaz or DiCaprio are convincing and there acting skills are just flat all the way through this film. Another pitfall of this film is the miserable film score. the pulsating high school marching band style snare drums that continuously play to a fast paced beat actually begins to give you a headache before the film is finished."

So much movie; so little outcome.<br/><br/>The plot left us only two possible Hollywood endings, the first that Amsterdam would kill Bill the Butcher and the second that he would be unable or unwilling to kill him when a position to do it because of conscience or a growing mutual or unilateral affection. A possible variation of the second might be that he had to kill Bill though he no longer wanted to do so. The ending turned out to be the cheap and predictable choice, since that's what the audience had been conditioned to want by Bill's evil antics and Scorsese's manipulation. But it went as flat as a Perrier that's been standing too long.<br/><br/>If, as Francis Bacon put it, 'revenge is a dish best eaten cold', Amsterdam almost carried it, but the act of revenge itself was an anti-climax because of the violence which preceded it. Certainly, when compared with the drama of a build-up to a denouement in westerns like High Noon, it paled. Scorsese fell into the deep crevasse between drama (well, melodrama, if you want) and documentary, so the violence of the riot also served to numb us to the supposed climax. Bill the Butcher, so flamboyant and threatening, went out with a whimper on the hilarious line, 'At least I died an American'. Stanley Kubrick would laugh; Peter Sellars howl. My stomach turned. Could the millions of dollars not buy a better exit line? Daniel Day-Lewis was so far over the top, he must have suffered from vertigo for weeks after. A patch over his eye, a crutch under his arm and a parrot on his shoulder and he would have been a great Long John Silver in a Christmas pantomime on Blackpool Pier. I expected at any moment to hear 'Aye, Jim lad' or 'Avast there me hearties'. Alas, no. This was far worse. And the accent, surely not of the 19th century, but of thirties gangster movies, its only function to mark Bill as a 'native'? What a pity none of the other 'natives' spoke like that, failing which the various groups should have been color coded with rosettes or given football shirts.<br/><br/>If Day-Lewis was over the top, most of the other characters were no more than cardboard cutouts. Di Caprio showed he has not developed his acting ability since that appalling production of 'The Man in the Iron Mask' in which he played the most forgettable Prince Louis in the long history of swashbucklers. He was little different to his character in 'Titanic', talked in the same way, moved in the same way, and appeared to be thinking in the same way. Robert Redford's handsome sameness had an attractive quality. This sameness has none. It is dull in its shallow dourness. Nor has it gone further in 'Catch me if you Can'. Hollywood needs better acting from its young stars: good looks, though they may capture the hearts of schoolgirls for a while, do not make for enduring careers at the top without talent. James Dean had both but made the unfortunate career move of dying so we cannot judge a later career. Di Caprio, alas, does not. Put a stone on him, a few inches on his waistline, and his fans will disappear, if they haven't deserted in droves already.<br/><br/>On the one hand, Amsterdam bore too lightly the Orestian imperative to revenge his father, and on the other had no Shakespearian qualms of conscience. Rounded characters have doubts and conscience like real people, but then Scorsese is not Shakespeare, nor is he John Ford, who could give his great western characters a humanity and a depth fathoms deeper than any shown by Scorsese in this film.<br/><br/>Where's The Method in all this acting? Lee Strasberg would turn in his grave. What will they think of it all down at The Actor's Studio? Maybe they'll develop The New Method, of which lesson one would begin, 'Put on a phony and grimace fiercely.' This was not acting, it was performing. This was not film; it was pantomime.<br/><br/>It was also morality play with Day-Lewis as Satan, Di Caprio a type of Christ about his father's business, and Diaz as Mary Magdalen, with a supporting cast of predictable and grimacing devils of various shades of evil, for, unlike Dickens or Dostoyevsky, nothing good seemed to shine out in The Five Points.<br/><br/>Hollywood being what it is, there will be mutual backslapping with award after award, but when the scented smoke of self-congratulation clears, this will be seen as an inferior movie with much less in it than meets the eye. However, as the young man who runs my local DVD rental shop told me, 'It's Scorsese, so you have to see it!' Nicholas Dunne-Lynch 2004."

","Very, very poor job by Mr. Scorsese.  I own most of his fine films from ""The Shave"" through ""Raging Bull.""  And Gangs of New York is by far his worst film.  Leo is absolutely useless as an actor.  I pity his fans.  This movie depicted the Irish siding with the freed-slaves, this is incorrect.

","Over-budgeted, over-hyped, over-indulgent.<br/><br/>A fine example of when a decent director buys into his own hype. No longer having to prove himself, Scorsese over-indulges his over-ripe ego and beats us over the head with over-the-top symbolizm, acting and imagery. Moulan Rouge meets Braveheart - but lacking the vision or sentimentality of either film. From the carnivalesque costumes to the pathetically forced accents, I wasn't only bored by the film, I was at times even embarrassed by it. The sort of film lauded by those who think they appreciate artistic vision and quality performances because they are told to. Rubbish."

Many elements in the movie weren`t scary or horrific but very funny. <br/><br/>SPOILER!!!<br/><br/>When Bill The Butcher is being stabbed to dead, you can see blood squirting right into DiCaprio`s face.

","The film was dark, dirty, violent and, except for the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and John C. Reilly, everyone else bored me to death. I didn't care about any of the characters in the movie. The film went on interminably showing one extreme brutality after another throughout the film. There was very little of anything else. I thought Leonardo DiCaprio was miscast and looked like a child in a man's clothing in the role of Amsterdam Vallon, a leader of a New York Irish gang in the 1800s, and Cameron Diaz was also miscast. I hated the brutality and the whole appearance of this film and found no redeeming qualities in it whatsoever. Next to American Beauty and Once Upon a Time in Mexico (tied for the worst film ever made) this stands next in line for the crown."

","With some good old Dickensiana thrown in to heal the wounds. <br/><br/>From the very start, with the appearance of Liam Neeson in yet another benevolent hero role, the tone is set for the cliché overload. Instead of creating a Great Grassroot American Epic by drawing on slightly more expansive sources than his usual local themes, Scorcese falls into all the usual traps of the historical spectacle and swaps the narrative for the choreographed sketches interspersed with inept political commentary. Unfortunately, the ambitious allegory he aims for gets as confusing as his storytelling and the cultural stereotypes abound. <br/><br/>Good points are few and all to do with solid cast, particularly Jim Broadbent and gloriously hammy Day Lewis. David Hemmings is enjoyable in his Darth Vader cameo and a sufficient quota of erotic images are strategically placed to keep the audience from falling asleep in the third act. <br/><br/>However, the overall impression is that this might have worked out better set to Andrew Lloyd Weber score (even though the excessive use of pig carcasses and some of the mise en scene did recall Greenaway - hopefully, Philip Glass will make an opera out of this at some point)."

","It would be fitting if Daniel Day Lewis followed the first Oscar for a body part (""My Left Foot"") with an another for his moustache in this film. His moustache dominates a film that otherwise lacks anything other than random mayhem, unlikeable characters and a predictable showdown.<br/><br/>
Two gangs dominate the ""Five Points"" of New York. One gang are as nice a bunch of raindancing, Oirish cut throats as you are ever likely to meet in a Hollywood movie. The other led by Lewis's ""Bill the Butcher"" are the ""Natives"", a bunch of nasty native-born Protestant patriots, who don't dance and who throw stones at Irish immigrants as they first step foot in the new world.<br/><br/>Scorsese clearly found the Irish more interesting that the ""Natives"" because despite Butcher Bill's religious bigotry, most of his gang seem to consist of Irish Catholics, not to mention his favourite pickpocket/<br/><br/>prostitute (played by Cameron Diaz). In fact poor Bill doesn't seem to have a single real ""Native"" friend except when a big street fight is in the offing, when large gangs of WASPs (presumably Wall Street brokers) come downtown to beat the Irish.<br/><br/>Not since ""Heaven's Gate"" has there been a movie with such huge scenes of poor immigrants constantly surging through the streets but never getting anywhere.<br/><br/>The film is basically a simple story or revenge that attempts to say something meaningful but fails. I wish I could write that ""I'm not saying anymore because it would give away the plot"" but I'm afraid that is the plot.<br/><br/>The film does have its occasional moments in a ""Far and Away"" kind of way and to be fair to Daniel Day Lewis, his performance (moustache and all)is brilliant, given the limitations of the script.<br/><br/>In the long-term this film could take two paths, it could slowly fade into obscurity or after the inevitable 4 hour director's cut it could emerge even duller to be acclaimed as a misunderstood masterpiece."

","Everybody knows Scorsese is a terrific director. After all, ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"" are certainly two of the best movies ever.<br/><br/>But I´m sorry to say that this time he just blew it! This movie, in my opinion, is a waste of perfectly good celluloid! Here are the reasons why I think this film sucks: 1) Too long ! I don´t know what happened, but perhaps Mr. Scorsese got a little carried away when shooting ""the movie that he always wanted to shoot"". Result: very boring 2 hours and 40 minutes, when this film could have been done in just 2 hours. ""LOTR"" was fine, but ""Gangs"" lacks the storyline for a movie with such length. 2) Leo Di Caprio. His acting is so inexpressive, he could have been replaced for a cardboard dummy of himself. I just couldn´t find other feelings for his character other than boredom. Amsterdam is clearly the ""hero"" of this movie, but he just hasn´t got the guts to be one. Oh, his ""accent"" just SUCKS big time. 3) Weak plot. Yeh, yeh, yeh: my dad just got killed by his nemesis, so I´ll have my revenge when I grow old.First:I´ll get close to him. Second: I´ll gain his confidence. Third and main part:if everything works out,  PAYBACK TIME ! Oh man, didn´t I heard it all before somewhere ? 4) Lots of continuity mistakes. Per example: the part where Amsterdam makes a toast to Bill the butcher, his glass is half-filled with wine.<br/><br/>Next shot: his glass is EMPTY !! Next shot: FULL AGAIN ! Whoa, those guys can drink REALLY fast, huh ? And what about the extras STARING at the camera at that first battle (natives X dead rabbits)? DUHHHHH ! 5) Cameron Diaz. I think that she´s in this film just because of her (great)looks, because her character just doesn´t matter to the storyline. Picture this movie without her. Any changes? Not for me. This film isn´t good. But let´s face it: Daniel Day-Lewis saves the day here. His acting is superb. In my opinion, Bill the butcher is the main character of this film, instead of  Amsterdam ""Look-my face is glued"" Vallon. And the photography, soundtrack, costumes and everything technical was great. But if technical stuff really made movies good, XXX would have gotten the Oscar for best film. My grade for ""Gangs"": (4/10)"

"CinemaClown","Null","2","3","25 March 2018"," Everything About This Film Is Overshadowed By Daniel Day-Lewis' Astonishing Performance
","Beginning the director-actor collaboration between Martin Scorsese & Leonardo DiCaprio on a promising note, Gangs of New York paints a fascinating portrait of its era and is a meticulously researched period drama but pretty much everything about it is overshadowed by the exceptional performance from Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>Set in mid-19th century New York, the story of Gangs of New York follows an Irish immigrant who witnessed his father being murdered by the leader of an opposing gang as a kid and returns to the place years later to avenge his death. Meanwhile, the forced conscription in the ongoing Civil War ultimately leads to city wide riots.<br/><br/>Directed by Martin Scorsese, the 19th century New York comes to cinematic life in splendid detail and is a result of painstaking research & era appropriate set pieces. Scorsese's direction has the drama going up & down throughout its runtime, for many segments are highly engaging while others are poorly handled & tediously paced.<br/><br/>Production design team does a spectacular job at transporting the viewers back to its timeline and the entire cityscape has an authentic feel to it. Camera is expertly operated, utilising many of the director's trademarks. The pace only gets worse as plot progresses plus there are many scenes that the film could have done without. And Howard Shore turns in a fitting score.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Gangs of New York is spearheaded by a memorable showcase from Daniel Day-Lewis whose rendition of Bill the Butcher easily ranks amongst his finest acts. Leonardo DiCaprio also chips in with a strong input in his supporting role and so does the rest of the cast but none of them hold a candle to Day-Lewis magnetic screen presence & sheer commitment to his role.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Gangs of New York nails the period details of its story but the drama isn't entirely compelling and the only aspects that keep it together are its historical depictions & Daniel Day-Lewis' electrifying performance. Opening on a violent, chaotic & instantly gripping note but losing its grasp in the middle, Gangs of New York impresses in bits n pieces but it's nonetheless worth a watch for Day-Lewis' riveting act alone."

","With having the star-studded cast of Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, and Daniel Day-Lewis, it was hard not to be intrigued by this movie. I can now say I was not disappointed at all. Gangs of New York provided me with a greater insight into what actually happened in New York during the Civil War with the draft riots. I was unaware of how high the tensions actually were, and was most surprised when the firefighters even began fighting. The battle between Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Bill Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) is what made this movie. With Amsterdam seeking revenge on Bill for the death of his father as a child, it really kept me on my toes and rooting for Amsterdam throughout the whole movie. It did not feel like a long, boring three hour movie. An overall great film that I would recommend to anyone!"
"cdjh-81125","10","2","3","7 November 2016"," Scorsese' Underrated Masterpiece
","Martin Scorsese has proved himself to be the master of the mob movie but this was more than just the average mob movie but an inside look into the inner workings of New York City during the American Civil War and the lives of immigrants who lived through it. This was a passion project for Scorsese but when it came out it was written of as flawed and not one of his best and I have to disagree as I believe it's one of his best unlike most and is one of my favourites of all time. The location of New York was incredibly well executed I loved it the world felt lived in and dying with a rich history to it and its some of the best production design I've ever seen in a movie. But the locations are only as good as the characters who live in it and they were all incredibly well realised. Leonardo DiCaprio was perfect casting for this part he was just the right age to pull of that young brute quality that he couldn't pull of now and by its not means his best performance it's still a great one. But Daniel Day-Lewis gave an absolutely incredible performance and one that I believe to be his best he just sinks himself into this despicable and racist character who's able to be entertaining while at the same time terrifying and never leaves the audiences mind. When you hear the word, Gangs in the title you expect a lot of bloody battles but it's not really like that it's more of a dialogue driven political piece that's always interesting to watch. The way the characters go about fighting each other is fascinating to watch I love seeing the unusual methods they use on each other. The tension is slowly built up to a final battle that at first glance doesn't seem very satisfying but you quickly realise that it's meant to be like that your meant to question what the whole point of it all was and leaves a much bigger impact on the viewer that way. The final battle scenes are truly breathtaking you realise the hatred The goes on between all of them but it doesn't feel like pointless rage. Because of how well these characters are written you understand why they feel the way they do even if you know that it's the wrong attitude to have. One of the central plots of this movie is the love story between DiCaprio and Diaz and I personally thought it really worked I thought they boy had excellent chemistry and it really made me want them both to come out safe in the end and even though they do you (like them) do not know what to feel except the tragedies that occur. <br/><br/>Gangs of a New York is another testament to Martin Scorsese' greatness he proves himself to be the master of the mob genre but can do much more than just that and I hope that people will come to see this films greatness eventually. <br/><br/>A+/100%"

Amsterdam insinuates himself into Bill's circle.<br/><br/>This is a massive movie from Martin Scorsese. It is an admirable undertaking. Once again, Daniel Day-Lewis delivers a pitch perfect performance. He is exactly Bill the Butcher. He overshadows everybody including Leo. The story is a mess of characters and relationships.

","Scorsese was on a hot streak in the 70s, then on-and-off in the 80s and 90s. This 2002 masterpiece caused Scorsese to be on a hot streak again like in the 70s. It was also the first movie he did with Leonardo DiCaprio--the start of a great team. <br/><br/>The story isn't very original and the movie is too long. The near three hours could easily be condensed to a clean two hours. A regular revenge story with weak subplots that can be confusing as they become blurry. The movie is about a boy who witnesses his father being murdered by the ruthless Bill ""Butcher"" Cuttings (Day-Lewis). Sixteen years later, the boy (now Leo) returns to vow his father's murder. But rival gangs, love, loyalty, and Cuttings' ascension makes the job difficult. The acting is uncanny by everybody. But Day-Lewis steals the show. The riots and action are extremely brutal, but very entertaining. As I mentioned before, the movie is too long, but the entertainment and movie making really make up for the slowness. Condensed, this would be in the Top 250 and be considered a Scorsese masterpiece. I don't find this to be a masterpiece, but it is very close to it. Like The Outsiders--it was as close to being a masterpiece without actually being one. But still, I really think that this deserves more. It should be considered more iconic, and more or a landmark in all the aspects this has."
"tomgillespie2002","6","2","3","15 July 2012"," A messy yet thrilling historical epic
","After seeing his father 'Priest' (Liam Neeson) murdered at the hands of rival gang leader Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) 16 years before, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the Five Points in New York seeking revenge. Not much has changed since he fled, as tension remains between the 'Natives', the Irish immigrants, the Chinese and the blacks, only Bill now rules over with an iron fist, helping corrupt politician William 'Boss' Tweed (Jim Broadbent) gain votes. With the help of old friend Johnny (Henry Thomas), Amsterdam finds himself working his way up Bill's ranks, and after thwarting an assassination attempt on Bill, Amsterdam wonders if he did it out of his desire to kill Bill himself, or a growing loyalty to his new employer.<br/><br/>Following a lengthy book-to-screen adaptation, Scorsese's historical epic reached the cinema screens 23 years after he bought the rights to Herbert Asbury's book The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld, amongst stories of studio fall-outs and arguments over final cut. It seems all those years of pondering did not allow Scorsese to fine-tune his vision, and although the film looks absolutely astonishing, the result is a bit of a mess, albeit one that never gets boring. Telling such a detailed historical account of America's fist- fights for power amongst mass immigration and racial tension could not have come at a more suitable time, as the 9/11 attacks occurred during production. But Scorsese chooses to cram this in with sub-plots of political corruption, a love-story between Amsterdam and thief Jenny (Cameron Diaz), the New York Draft Riots, and the central revenge story.<br/><br/>Of course, the film's ultimate saving grace is Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives a theatrical, sledgehammer performance as the one eyed-monster, and his scene where he sits talking to Amsterdam with an American flag draped over his shoulders is worth a thousand Academy Awards alone. Among the wave of dodgy Oirish accents, DiCaprio's isn't that bad, pulling of a credible performance which would jump-start his close relationship with Scorsese in the years after. Amsterdam is no regular hero, he's just as violent as the next thug, and one of the most interesting aspects of the film is how Scorsese tends not to show any race or group in a particularly good light. This is America's dirty beginnings after all, and boy is it bloody - heads are bludgeoned, cheeks are torn from their face - it's probably Scorsese's most gruesome since Casino (1995).<br/><br/>Second time around, Gangs of New York did seem admittedly better paced and more fleshed out (I thought I might even be watching a director's cut), with the political goings-on and the various sub-plots making much more sense. But the film is still a mess, and it progresses with a taste for almost glamorising the violence. The opening scene depicting the bloody fight between the Butcher's natives and the Priest's Dead Rabbits comes with slow-motion and electric guitar music, and this punk-ish approach causes it to clash with its historical setting. However, it looks staggering. The costumes, the huge sets, and the dirt and grit, has an epic David Lean quality, almost old-fashioned in a way. Yet this is a very modern film, and perhaps a more classical approach may have benefited the film which is ultimately unfocused, but effortlessly thrilling.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","Gangs of New York... where to start? The film is good in a sense I didn't expect. I was thinking... Leonardo DiCaprio, big-budget history piece, full of inaccuracies. In fact, the entire film walks and moves like a ghost story. The images are so powerful, and always remain true to very feel of the world. It feels like we aren't watching a film, we're watching lives.<br/><br/>That's the truth of why this film affected me. Not only was it extraordinarily well-made (using modern hints to imply the brewing war) but there was a deep sorrow to it. The tribal battles of ancient warring nations, in a roiling furnace of tradition and furor, were overtaken by the New World. That's what makes it so terrible--- it isn't that so many men and women lost their lives to self-made war; it's that they are totally forgotten. The gangs of New York were overtaken by the city; lost to the corruption they created. As Amsterdam says in the end of the film: ""It's like no one will ever know we were ever here."" The real tragedy is shown in the final sequence... the gravestones fall over and, with years, the truth is made clear: no one cares about the ""hands that built America"", or what those hands broke creating.<br/><br/>That's the deeper meaning. The ancient feud of rival tribes is swallowed up by the progression of the era. Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam can war with each other all they want... but they lived and died in the past, the land they worked so hard to make their own taken up by the cops and professional fire departments and city sanitation services.<br/><br/>I think that--- and the amazing use of image and music--- is what really got me. Nine out of ten. (It would be ten straight, if there hadn't been so much bare breasts in the film. That bugged me.) Definitely see it!"

","Others crying ""Worst Film of The Year!"", ""Utter CRAP!!"", and ""Shamefully Awful!!"" make want to laugh. The fact is, Scorcese could direct a better film IN HIS SLEEP than ninety per cent of the cookie-cutter crap that floats down the Hollywood pike. Gangs has flaws, most definitely, but in all honesty it seems as though many were sharpening their knives before the film even recieved general release, salivating at the prospect of tearing apart a fallen cinematic great. Arguments levelled against it? A mish-mash of themes-welcome to new York, births of cities-and countries over all-don't come through easy-to-label moral triumphs. Unnecessary voice-over-I'll concede ground on this one. Overly long-Jeezum Crow, if you can't sit through three hours then you shouldn't go to the cinema. Nothing happened-the total, absolute opposite of the film; in fact, the film crammed so much in that it felt rushed at points. Historically innaccurate-I'd wager that Scorcese and those involved know roughly 100% more than anyone here about the birth of NY. Overly romanticised-the subplot with Diaz WAS superfluous, I'll give you that, but when you've got a character as complex in both subtelty and grandeur as Bill Cutting, thee's more than enough to outweigh that negative. Flawed, but still astonishing and above 95% of film-making today, GONY is a must-see.

"d2-12","1","8","21","7 May 2006"," Bad movie, historically inaccurate, and a propaganda piece.
","This film is a propaganda piece of the anti-American, anti-Protestant, and anti-war faction of the far left in Hollywood. It features heroic Roman Catholics pitted against venal Protestants in the classic format of cowboys versus Indians. Poor Catholics are immediately recruited as cannon fodder for Mr Lincoln's war, and the rest are preyed upon by hostile Protestant inhabitants of New York. The good Catholics (played poorly by Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio), fight against injustice and for their ""rights"" denied them by the Protestants, even though as immigrants just off the boat they have no knowledge or appreciation of America, its history, or the obligations of its citizenry. When the draft is instituted and Catholics are named for reporting for army duty, riots break out, with protesters killing, looting, lynching Negroes and defying federal troops. Somehow the director shifts the historical blame from the Catholics and features Protestants rioting, with the Catholics falling victim to the Army, Navy and rioters. Obviously, Mr Lincoln's war is not one that should be fought by the poor. How liberal of the directors and writers -- perhaps they would fight. But no, more appropriately all wars are bad. The director, Martin Scorsese, has seen fit to lionize DiCaprio's band of criminals as builders of the city and standing for diversity, even including a Negro in his gang. At the end, the anti-war message is no longer subtle -- the shots of the cemetery going to seed while the city grows to include the WTC towers ""proves"" the futility of war. Of course, the towers were already gone in 2002 when this film was made, but to show the loss of the towers would be contrary to the director's point. All the talk about ""that a city is built from the streets"" is so much camouflage for the true message in the film. The director and writers need to learn that a city is not built by its poorest and criminal elements but rather by the hard-working middle class and capitalists willing to invest in the city."

Personally, I had not been aware of how large an aspect of life gangs played in major cities in the US. It is quite a long movie at almost 3 hours, so some parts could get a bit boring to some viewers, but as a whole, the movie is well made. The casting was done very well, the actors portrayed their characters accurately. Leonardo DiCaprio was a strong choice for the lead and showed his incredible acting abilities. You automatically support him. Daniel Day Lewis is the perfect amount of creepy and twisted to play ""butcher"" and does tremendous throughout the movie."

","The start of the movie was interesting with the fight scene and showing part of Amsterdam's's (Leonardo DiCaprio) past. The movie was very violent but at many parts it was very good. During some of the ""slow parts"" (parts of no fighting) it did get kind of boring but in most parts it was interesting.The play with Abraham Lincoln was kind of confusing because I thought that it was actually Lincoln but then soon realized he was hanging from a rope. There are many fight scenes in this movie and I think that it kind of keeps the movie going. They do not talk about the killed father at the beginning much, but they do mention him to keep Amsterdam in place. Cameron Diaz' character was not very beneficial to the story but she did add an interesting part of the story. The torture scene that Amsterdam is in looked very painful and very unnecessary. Amsterdam's revenge on his father's killer went downhill for him after that torture scene. After Jenny helped Amsterdam out she was not really needed. So pretty much, Amsterdam did a good job trying to kill his father's murderer and Jenny was not really needed in the story. The movie did point out many different accurate historical events such as the 5-point plan. The movie was well done and nicely laid out with a lot of fight scenes and many love parts in the entirety."
"victoriawaud","7","1","1","22 December 2016"," Leo Lover (he deserves an Oscar for every movie)
","Majority of the movie was very intriguing, because there were fight scenes and it was establishing the setting of an Irish-immigrant populated city during war. It begins with a flashback to Leonardo DiCaprio's character's past and foreshadows his future. The movie is mostly historically accurate when it displays the enforcement of the draft, Uncle Tom's Cabin, and Abraham Lincoln - which were major figures during this time period. It also highlights daily life of Irish immigrants in New York, and their struggles and joys. The emotions and actions of the characters in public places is also mostly historically accurate to the time. However, one moment where accuracy was hindered when Leo's character was being tortured only because he is the son of a priest (and he is looking for his father's killer), it was very shocking and unnecessary in my opinion, however this situation brought him and Cameron Diaz' character closer because she wanted him to be freed from this torture, and for him to get revenge. I think it is completely normal for Leo to be seeking revenge throughout the film, since his father was unfairly taken from him at such a young age. DiCaprio's character did a good job in trying to get revenge for his father, and Diaz' character was not really needed in the story, but she was more to keep the story going, as a love appeal.

","While both Lewis and DiCaprio do a fantastic job in this movie it is quite long so make sure you have a healthy amount of popcorn for your movie watching. I love this movie do to the heritage that it has. I have always been one for Irish films or Irish based films. In this movie you see the clash of ""clans"" between the natives and the Irish. Dicaprio's father is murdered in a gang war at the beginning of the movie by native ""The Butcher"" played by Daniel Day-Lewis. Amsterdam (DiCaprio) is just a boy at the time and see's his fathers murder. The Natives men try to capture Amsterdam to raise him in there ways but he is quick to escape. Jumping forward in time after disappearing when he was younger Amsterdam comes back to seek revenge for his fathers death, creating a whole push and pull between the Butcher and Amsterdam. Amsterdam gains the Butchers trust and is let into his gang. It's not long before the Butcher realizes who Amsterdam is though. After he finds out its all out war yet again. I have always enjoyed both Day-Lewis's acting along with DiCaprio. They have always been exceptional actors and always play very calculated characters. I found this movie to be nothing short of one of their bests and I love the acting between the two. You could not have picked to better actors to put into a movie together. I only give this movie a 9 due to it's length. Now mind you I watched the long TV movie version so it ended up being around three hours long, but it is quite enjoyable to say the least."

","Gangs of New York (2002): Dir: Martin Scorsese / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Liam Neeson, Jim Broadbent: Film about a society or assembly of violence presented in a historical manner. Opens in 1800's with a savage gang war where a boy witnesses the murder of his father at the hands of Bill the Butcher. Leonardo DiCaprio returns as an immigrant to slay the man who murdered his father and disgraced his people. He meets a pickpocket who disarms her victims through seduction. He also learns that members of his father's gang betrayed him. Concludes with senseless brutality in its ugliest. Directed by Martin Scorsese whose career has given us many great films including Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. DiCaprio is superb as he dares place his hands in the flames of danger without care or consequence. Daniel Day-Lewis plays the foul and ruthless Butcher in one of his best performances. Cameron Diaz is excellent as a pickpocket targeted for a knife throwing act. Liam Neeson plays DiCaprio's father in a role that is far too familiar. Neeson seems typecast in a mistake normally not made by a pro such as Scorsese. This is familiar ground for Neeson and the role itself is perhaps the weakest writing of the film. We know the drill even as the war wages on. Tremendous production visualizes the onslaught in its horrid reality. Score: 8 ½ / 10"

Daniel Day-lewis's Butcher is a notable example of a character who keeps the film interesting throughout.Despite this certain characters are not very entertaining which would be acceptable if they were vital to the plot but most are not.

"CalvinValjean","9","1","1","28 March 2015"," Good, But Missed the Mark
","This is a tough film to review. GoNY was a major ""film event"" on its release, yet it wasn't quite what people were expecting. While I do like it, I found it took me about 3-4 viewings to fully get it, and since then, the film has lingered a bit as a mixed bag. The conclusion I came to is that this is a good film, but also a victim of story problems and overhype.<br/><br/>The backstory is that Scorsese came upon a history book on NYC and fell in love with this period. Wanting to make a film set in this time, he commissioned a script to be written that covered all the main points he wanted (the draft riots, illegal boxing, NYC's competing fire departments). And because of this, what we get is a film more interested in its setting, historical context, and political subtext than it is in its A-story.<br/><br/>On the positive-side, no one can deny the film's production value: larger-than-life sets, sweeping cinematography, meticulous attention to detail. The film has a great sense of scope. Most of all, the film is very rich in subtext. Scorsese tells us the story of the US being born and deconstructs the idealistic image of ""the Land of the Free."" Immigrants are exploited off the boat and enlisted in a war they know nothing about, politics are corrupt, northerners are either racist or indifferent to the Civil War and flat-out hate Lincoln. Parallels are immediately drawn with the state of the US today, with immigration, rigged elections, and ""Native Americans fearing foreign influence"" (a phrase that takes on an ironic meaning given today's definition of the term). The film ends with a shot of modern NYC with the World Trade Center standing proudly, having a very haunting effect and making us think of modern violence. The movie had the perfect tagline: ""America was born in the streets"" and this motif is depicted perfectly.<br/><br/>But while this internal story is great, the external one it's placed upon just...isn't all that great. The main plot is filled with tropes and clichés about a man named Amsterdam seeking revenge on a gang-leader. Amsterdam is not a very interesting lead character, and it's one of DiCaprio's less compelling roles. His romance with Jenny (Cameron Diaz) is not particularly strong either, and there are many hackneyed narrative devices (surrogate father, lovers triangle, blood vendettas). The narrative itself isn't quite cohesive: there's a whole subplot about Brendan Gleeson's character running for office in a rigged election and then getting killed. Why is this there? It appears towards the start of the third act, takes up 20 minutes of screen time, and hurts the pacing. John C. Reilly is also in the film in a role that feels like it was once much bigger.<br/><br/>The one thing everyone loved about the film was Daniel Day-Lewis; a whole new generation of filmgoers first discovered him in this role, given his long absence from the screen at the time. The thing is that, it's now difficult to not compare the role to his later role in THERE WILL BE BLOOD. The two characters look and sound similar, and Daniel Plainview blows Bill the Butcher out of the water. Watching it today, Bill almost feels like a dress-rehearsal for the superior performance as Plainview.<br/><br/>Finally, GoNY was also hurt by its marketing. I remember seeing the very first trailer in the summer of 2001, as it was originally intended to be released that Christmas season. It ended up being delayed a year due to issues in post production (and I suspect also partially due to 9/11). So when it was finally released in Christmas of 2002, it had been a year and a half of seeing trailers and hearing so much about film. The marketing campaign was extremely aggressive, promising a great historical epic, campaigned hard for Oscars that the film seemed tailor-made to sweep, and especially made a point of emphasizing ""C'mon and give Scorsese that long-overdue Best Director Oscar."" In the end, it failed to win a single award, which seemed to be a clear sign of rejection by audiences (COLD MOUNTAIN had a similarly-obnoxious marketing campaign the following year which also backfired).<br/><br/>I still remember seeing the film opening weekend with a packed house. The moment it began to end and the music swelled, half the audience started getting up and leaving. Outside in the lobby everyone was talking about their odd reaction. It wasn't necessarily outright negative, but just an overall feeling of ""Is that it? Why did it need to be so long to just be that? After all the hype, there's a lot less to the movie than it seemed."" I suspect Scorsese intended the film to be something quite different, but along the way Harvey Weinstein turned it into an epic, intended Oscar juggernaut, which it was not.<br/><br/>Speaking of THERE WILL BE BLOOD, that may be a good template for what Scorsese was going for. That film is also large in scope with a director's passion for a historical setting and attention to detail that clearly shows, but the narrative is much less Hollywood, more intimate, unconventional yet engrossing. It's an approach that would have served GoNY well. As it stands, GoNY has its fans, but has never quite reached the heights of a classic, or influenced the public consciousness. A good film, but a missed opportunity."

","Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young Irish immigrant released from prison. He returns to the Five Points seeking revenge against his father's killer, William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), a powerful anti-immigrant gang leader. He knows that revenge can only be attained by infiltrating Cutting's inner circle. Amsterdam's journey becomes a fight for personal survival and to find a place for the Irish people in 1860's New York. Gangs of New York is a 2002 American epic historical drama film set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of Lower Manhattan in 1863. The film was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan, inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1927 non-fiction book, The Gangs of New York. It was made in Cinecittà, Rome, distributed by Miramax Films and nominated for numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Picture.<br/><br/>Most of the film takes place in 1863. The two principal issues of the era in New York were Irish immigration to the city and the ongoing Civil War. The story follows Bill ""the Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) in his roles as crime boss and political kingmaker under the helm of ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent). The film culminates in a violent confrontation between Cutting and his mob with protagonist Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) and his allies, which coincides with the New York Draft Riots of 1863."

Leonardo Dicaprio does a well job at portraying the raw feeling of loss and conflict from beginning to end of the storyline through multiple events that happen to him and the others he becomes acquainted with.

","The violent rise of gangland power in New York City at a time of massive political corruption and the city's evolution into a cultural melting pot set the stage for this lavish historical epic, which director Martin Scorsese finally brought to the screen almost 30 years after he first began to plan the project. In 1846, as waves of Irish immigrants poured into the New York neighborhood of Five Points, a number of citizens of British and Dutch heritage who were born in the United States began making an open display of their resentment toward the new arrivals. William Cutting (Daniel Day- Lewis), better known as ""Bill the Butcher"" for his deadly skill with a knife, bands his fellow ""Native Americans"" into a gang to take on the Irish immigrants; the immigrants in turn form a gang of their own, ""The Dead Rabbits,"" organized by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). After an especially bloody clash between the Natives and the Rabbits leaves Vallon dead, his son goes missing; the boy ends up in a brutal reform school before returning to the Five Points in 1862 as Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio). Now a strapping adult who has learned how to fight, Amsterdam has come to seek vengeance against Bill the Butcher, whose underworld control of the Five Points through violence and intimidation dovetails with the open corruption of New York politician ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent). Amsterdam gradually penetrates Bill the Butcher's inner circle, and he soon becomes his trusted assistant. Amsterdam also finds himself falling for Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful but street-smart thief who was once involved with Bill. Amsterdam is learning a great deal from Bill, but before he can turn the tables on the man who killed his father, Amsterdam's true identity is exposed, even though he has concealed it from nearly everyone, including Jenny."

"BeMi21","7","1","1","18 June 2014"," Gangs of New York Has Its Epic Moments, But Also Some Flaws
","I've always thought of Martin Scorsese as a perfectionist and this movie proves it again. Scorsese rebuilt a believable, accurate portrayal of New York during middle of the 19th century. Thanks to the great images and shots the movie has the right to be regarded as an epic although the whole movie (particularly the story) has its weaknesses.<br/><br/>The movie is about vengeance. So it is nothing that we haven't seen before (and we will see lots of other movies about the same subject.) The interesting thing about the plot is - or could have been - the historical background. It is set during a developing America. However, I didn't get a satisfying view of American culture during that time. Yes, Scorsese presents us the rivaling gangs and the mob on the streets, but still the view stays superficial.<br/><br/>The main problem for me were the characters.<br/><br/>I've never considered Cameron Diaz as a great actress and here she seems absolutely miscast to me. It was a good idea to create a female character in that violent, male-shaped environment, but Cameron Diaz' doesn't do anything instead of being bitchy and annoying without giving her character any likable strains.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's main character stays pale throughout the whole movie. I don't think that this is DiCaprio's fault, he is quite good in his role, but nothing more. There is no much character development (although he is the protagonist), his character isn't supposed to show much emotion what doesn't make him likable and I think there aren't a lot of moments where we can really empathize with him.<br/><br/>However, the movie's salvation is Daniel Day-Lewis. His performance is a revelation, every scene he appears is pure entertainment thanks to his savage turn as Bill the Butcher. What he does isn't only acting, it's a complete transformation. He changes his voice, his accents, his movements, his expression so that it's hard to believe that Bill and Daniel Day-Lewis are the same persons. <br/><br/>Jim Broadbent gives also a good performance as the corrupt William Tweed and he grants us some moments of humor.<br/><br/>All in all I'd say the movie is good and (without a doubt) greatly made but it has its flaws and its lengths, I lost my interest in DiCaprio's story and in most of the other characters. I doubt that the movie would be the same without Daniel Day-Lewis and without Scorsese's name on it."

But what was Delivered is Compelling if not Perfect. If it does have a Failing, it is the Revenge Theme, the Love Story, and a Weakness in its Casting of Leonardo DiCaprio.<br/><br/>The Movie's Strength is its Capture of the the Time and Place, the Hordes and the Corrupt and Xenophobic Leaders in this Tumultuous Time in the Nations Melting Pot. It is an Historical Meilu that is Unfamiliar, Conveniently Forgotten, Swept Under, and is Really an Embarrassing Truth about Tribal Warfare and Pig-Headed, Ignorant People Existing in Squalor and is a Filthy Fact that is not Easily Embraced.<br/><br/>That could be One of the Reasons for the Film's Detractors. It is Anything but Pretty. The Driving Force in the Film, other than the Outstanding Sets, Costumes, and Production is Daniel Day Lewis' Unforgettable and Unrestrained Performance as Bill the Butcher. The rest of the Cast just cannot Keep Up with HIs Dominating Presence.<br/><br/>While not a Great Film, it is Nevertheless Excellent and Important. Hypnotic, Dense, and Determined it Accomplishes more than its Critics will Admit. There is a Weakness in the Central, Personal Story but it more than makes up for it in the Grandeur of its Historical Hindsight that is a Welcome Inclusion because it has been a Purposeful Non-Entry in the American Mindset."

","This is a short review and it contains spoilers so don't read this if you haven't seen 'Gangs of New York'.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film a lot, but there are a few points I have that affected my rating on it, I have a short list below of negative points I'd like to mention.<br/><br/>1. The movies is too long, there were a lot of scenes in there that really wasn't necessary to move the story forward, yet the movie is nearly three hours long. The first time I saw was on television that had commercial breaks so in the end I had spent about 3.5 hours watching this. I enjoy long movies, but like I said, there are so many filler scenes in there that it wasn't necessary to make it this long.<br/><br/>2. Bad Irish accents. This is not too big of an issue, but it was quite annoying. I am not Irish myself, but it still bothered me when some of the American actors tried to speak with an Irish accent when it sounded horrible. The worst one I think was John C. Reilly's performance. His acting was pretty good, but that accent was just plain bad.<br/><br/>3. This is my biggest issue with the film, I liked William Cutting (Butcher Bill) more than Amsterdam! Amsterdam was sometimes annoyingly stupid and Butcher Bill wasn't the best antagonist, the character was brilliant and I really liked Daniel Day-Lewis's performance. However, in Amsterdam's eyes he was this psycho asshole who killed Amsterdams father, 'Priest' Vallon. This is not the case since it is obvious that Bill respected him and he killed him honorably. Then Amsterdam still acts like an idiot and tries to kill him in front of everyone and fails completely. The thing I didn't like about the Butcher was that when Amsterdam attacked him from behind he thought he was a coward for doing so, but later he just throws an axe in Brendan Gleeson's characters back! Before this scene Bill seemed to be living with some honor and by some moral rules, but he just breaks it all of a sudden, doesn't make sense to me.<br/><br/>Anyways, it's overall a good film and definitely worth watching even though it suffers at times."

"hall895","9","1","1","25 August 2013"," Born in the streets
","Gangs of New York takes a fascinating look at a largely forgotten slice of American history. As the film's tagline states, America was born in the streets. This is the tale of the 19th century Irish immigrants who came to New York City to build a new life for themselves and of the ""Natives"" who tormented them. Put ""Natives"" in quotation marks because they are not natives at all, their ancestors came over from Europe just as the Irish were doing now. But, led by the villainous Bill the Butcher, the Natives make life miserable for the poor Irish who are just trying to survive in New York's notorious Five Points slum. Bill the Butcher rules the Five Points with an iron fist, the Irish rally behind their own leader, Priest Vallon, to oppose him. The film opens with a battle in the streets, the Butcher's gang of Natives squaring off with the Priest's Dead Rabbits, his gang of Irishmen (and an Irish lady, the fearsome Hell-Cat Maggie). Carnage ensues, this is one of the most violent, blood-soaked scenes ever seen in any film. Brutal, raw violence, hand-to-hand combat which ends with Priest Vallon falling under the Butcher's knife. Young Amsterdam Vallon witnesses his father's death. He is sent off to the orphanage. He'll be back.<br/><br/>16 years pass before Amsterdam returns to the Five Points. It is now 1862, the Civil War now rages and that war will come to touch the city. But the story the film follows is not of the grand scope of the great war but a smaller, more personal tale of Amsterdam's quest for vengeance. But it is not as easy as just turning up in the Five Points and stabbing Bill the Butcher while he sleeps. Bill is the king of the Five Points and you kill a king where everyone can watch him die. Amsterdam makes plans to kill the Butcher at the annual commemoration of the victory of the Natives over the Dead Rabbits. But that is months away. In the meantime Amsterdam falls under Bill's sway, rising to become the right-hand man of the unwitting Butcher who does not know the young man's true identity. Eventually the time will come when Amsterdam must make his move. And then things will explode.<br/><br/>While the tale that Martin Scorsese tells here is a highly fictionalized account of what went on in the Five Points it is still a very worthy look at that unique time and place. The main storyline here may seem to be just a simple revenge story but there is so much else swirling around. Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher are not the only characters who have their own stories to tell. But it is the confrontation between those two characters which is at the heart of the film. That confrontation is made all the more fascinating by the fact they spend so much of the film as allies, Bill treating Amsterdam quite ironically almost as a son. Knowing Amsterdam's ultimate intentions you almost feel sorry for the Butcher. Almost. Because it is hard to generate true sympathy for this villainous, murderous man. An amazing character brought to life in a tour de force performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Day-Lewis plays the part with white-hot burning intensity. It would be a challenge for any actor to match him but Leonardo DiCaprio proves up to the task in the role of Amsterdam.<br/><br/>The brilliant performance of Day-Lewis is the best thing the film has to offer but there is much more here to catch the eye. DiCaprio is excellent as well and a fine cast of supporting players chip in splendidly. Most notable are Brendan Gleeson as another Irishman who will cross the Butcher and Jim Broadbent as the gleefully corrupt Boss Tweed. John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Liam Neeson and a host of lesser-known performers help to bring the Five Points to life. Perhaps the only misstep is Cameron Diaz who never entirely convinces in her role of a woman caught between Amsterdam and the Butcher. Diaz is not awful by any means but her performance just seems off a bit, she never quite seems to fit the role. Another issue comes with the film's ending, the sense that the climax doesn't quite match the epic opening. But these are only minor quibbles with a generally excellent film. Scorsese tells his fascinating story well, eventually weaving the larger war story into the mix. We see not just a personal battle between two men but ultimately a nation indeed being born in the streets. Visually the film is a masterpiece, Scorsese filling the frame beautifully. The bloody opening battle sets the tone for both the film's story and its look. The story holds your interest throughout and the look of the piece is just remarkable, the Five Points brought to brilliant life. This is a story which demanded to be told and that story could not have been placed in any better hands than those of Scorsese. This film does justice to those history has largely forgotten, those who through their working, living and dying built America."
"motorfocus82","7","1","1","24 January 2012"," Watch this for Daniel Day-Lewis
","There are obviously problems with this movie. The story is crappy, Diaz is superfluous and Leo is barely passable. And wow, is it long. They could have cut out huge portions of the thing and it would have been tighter and much more interesting.<br/><br/>For the people who say that the behavior of the mobs is unrealistic: Read a history book. The portrayal of people at their worst is refreshingly frank, and while Scorsese is pro-poor, he thankfully isn't deluded enough to BS this topic. The history of that period, of urban gang life and unrest, really stands out as the second most interesting part of the film to me, and it was really disappointing that Scorsese had to tack on a dull revenge/romance plot to justify spending the money to bring the period to life. I definitely think Scorsese should have found a better way, story-wise, to integrate the characters into the history. The cinematography is very good, same as the glimpse into the culture. If the story had been fresh or unpredictable or... meh<br/><br/>Anyway, the MOST interesting part of this thing is Daniel Day-Lewis, playing a character with a charisma all his own. You can't look away when he's on screen. This is, for some people, a form of overacting, but not me. I thought Lewis' performance was fantastic, nearly as good as his role in There Will Be Blood, and I'm definitely looking forward to his portrayal of Lincoln."

","Gangs of New York is a movie felt by many to be a turn in the career of legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese. It's dark and threatening tone paints a glum portrait of 19th century New York, drawing forth a pre-emptive revenge tale at the heart of the broken city. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio generates a career changing performance as Amsterdam, a distraught Irish orphan, plagued by the loss of his war-lord father (Liam Neeson) at the hands of the truly menacing William Cutting, or known by his 'street' alias, ""Bill the Butcher"" (an unforgettable Daniel Day-Lewis in his most iconic role). It is of course Day-Lewis who truly steals the show, ripping the shards of emotional drama from under the squelching shoes of an older, maturer DiCaprio than seen previously. This outing, boiling the former child-actor in bloodied fury, forcing his supposed unsalvageable career into a whole new league of adult- orientated entertainment. <br/><br/>Scorsese slices open the heart of American history, heaving its nasty past onto the screen in all its glory for all to see, unflinching in his presentation. The opening scene alone is a shower of gore and uncensored warfare, setting up the generic tale of ""keep your friends close but your enemies closer"" which takes place 16 years later. Having watched his father butchered by the leader of the gang known as the ""Natives"", a now older, tougher Amsterdam forces himself into the hands of controlling mob-boss Cutting who playfully jests with the vengeful soul. At 160 minutes, the film twists this story with inserts detailing the corruption and hardships of post-modern America, with focus particularly on the Civil War. This is Scorsese's unfortunate downfall, forcing an unrelated history lesson down the throats of the viewer when what he really should be doing is featuring more of the demented villain in all his unrelenting power. From the first glimpse of his curled moustache, William Cutting is an instant bad-ass, his menacing grace projected into the thoughts of the viewers at all times, his looming spirit ever-present. He is the true saviour of this, at times, sour tale of generic redemption. <br/><br/>By the time the Third Act final rolls in, boredom has spread and Scorsese's raw desire to leave nothing out becomes a hideous nuisance. So it was truthfully very wise for the master to leave the best for last. The final part of the film ditches the previous tripe at the road side, striking up a new angle on the tale of revenge (which frankly, he should have used from the start and made the movie an hour shorter) and fronting the finale with a war to end all wars. It is here when the film truly hits its stride, shamefully a mere 40 minutes before the end leaving this writer questioning the story-boarding skills of one Jay Cocks. An epic closure to the tale does however ensue, although the final battle more anti-climactic than expected, the departure of one character disappointingly average. <br/><br/>Overall, Scorsese's bloodied mirage of a forgotten New York City is an intense but emotionally forgettable experience. Overly long and full of tiresome historical pieces, the film lacks the gruelling and torturous finale it deserved and presented too many careless loose ends (Cameron Diaz becoming a non-essential lump of furniture within the tale). By no means a masterpiece but still a fantastic turn for the legendary director and a career-high for both Day-Lewis and DiCaprio, even if they did lack the powerful, crazed scenes which were hinted at several times throughout the script. The un-forgiving violence never lets up, providing a truthful take on an unknown story, pushing forth an original picture. Don't be fooled by the awards binge, this is no Oscar worthy delight, but an easily watchable and gruesomely memorable thriller. <br/><br/>8/10"
"ajs-10","8","1","1","18 November 2010"," Not perfect, but still recommended...
","This film has been lurking in my DVD collection for some time now. The trouble is, it's hard to find the nigh on three hours required to watch this epic. Fortunately, having been ordered to take my holidays, or lose them, a day off provided the necessary time-slot. It's a movie with tremendous scope that shows a side of New York history I wasn't aware of. Although not perfect, it still has a lot going for it. But more of that later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please assume the crash position for the next paragraph).<br/><br/>We begin in 1846 at the Five Points, a district of New York notorious for its poverty and for its gangs. A clash between two gangs, the 'Native Americans', predominantly white, who were born there and the 'Dead Rabbits', predominantly Irish immigrants, leaves the leader of the 'Dead Rabbits', 'Priest' Vallon, dead. His killer, leader of the other gang, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting shows mercy on his young son and sends him away. Sixteen years later the son, Amsterdam Vallon, returns to the Five Points seeking revenge, but prepared to bide his time. He decides to get close to Cutting and manages to do so with some great cunning. He meets Jenny Everdeane and falls for her, but she is indebted to Cutting and so Amsterdam, at first, spurns her, but we all know that isn't going to last. This is all told against the backdrop of the American Civil War and President Lincoln's plans to bring in a draft on the citizens of New York. There is a lot of feeling about this and the citizens are getting restless. Also, a politician, William 'Boss' Tweed is always trying to buy the votes of the residents of the Five Points by siding with Cutting on certain matters, a situation that doesn't go down to well with certain factions. Now, having infiltrated Cutting's inner circle, it's time for Amsterdam to strike and it's here I'll leave my short summary what? You didn't really expect me to give the ending away did you?... Shame.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully made film; everything from the cinematography to the set design to the costumes is all really well done. Some great performances too, especially from Daniel Day-Lewis, as Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, it is a pleasure to watch every scene he is in. Also praiseworthy are; Leonardo DiCaprio as Amsterdam Vallon and Cameron Diaz as Jenny Everdeane. Honourable mentions also go to; Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed, John C. Reilly as Happy Jack Mulraney and Henry Thomas as Johnny Sirocco.<br/><br/>I was afraid at first that this was going to be just another of those damned ""America loves everything Irish"" kind of movies, which I totally despise! Fortunately Scorsese knows better than that and what we get is a more balanced view of things (for a change). The film is a little too long for my liking and I found it quite easy to draw parallels with the likes of 'Goodfellas' and 'Once Upon A Time in America', but I can forgive that. It is enthralling throughout and a great visual spectacle, if just for the height of the top hats and Daniel Day-Lewis's moustache and trousers! They are tremendous! Over all, if you can make the time Highly recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.6/10"
"zardoz-13","6","1","1","30 August 2007"," Too Much ""Gang"" For One Bang!
","Director Martin Scorsese's long awaited urban crime saga ""Gangs of New York,"" starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Jim Broadbent, paints a vivid but unsavory picture of ethnic and racial intolerance in 19th century New York City against the bloody Union Draft Riots of 1863. Best known for his cinematic Italian mafia masterpieces: ""Mean Streets"" (1973, ""Goodfellas"" (1990), and ""Casino"" (1995), Scorsese explores the bigotry boiling over between white Anglo-Saxon, Protestant Americans and first-generation Irish immigrant in this costume-clad, period piece. Oscar-winning British actor Daniel Day-Lewis of ""My Left Foot"" takes top acting honors as a heavily mustached villain with a stovepipe hat who clashes with Irish good guy DiCaprio of ""Titanic"" fame.<br/><br/>Scorsese's lengthy 164-minute evocation of New York during the American Civil War gives audiences a glimpse of history that they may have never seen, especially when pugnacious Northerners lynch African-Americans. If Scorsese's politically incorrect posture isn't galling enough, he allows one of New York City worst criminals, Tammany Hall's Boss Tweed (British actor Jim Broadbent of ""The Avengers"") to emerge as a somewhat likable though thoroughly unscrupulous fellow. Like virtually all Scorsese movies, ""Gangs of New York"" relies on a narrator to fill in the gaps of the film's sprawling exposition.<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" opens one snowy morning in 1846 with a ferocious fistfight between William 'Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his chief rival 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson of ""Star Wars: Episode One"") for control over New York's Lower East Side. Cutting heads up a gang of proud Nativists. Not only do they hate the Irish, but also they despise freed African-Americans. During the savage battle of Five Points, as their fracas becomes known, Cutting carved up Vallon while Vallon's son Amsterdam watches. Afterward, Amsterdam winds up in an orphanage. When he leaves the orphanage some 16 years later, Vallon returns to Five Points to square accounts with Cutting. New York City consists largely of tribal gangs, while corrupt public officials, like corrupt public officials, like the infamous Boss Tweed, dominate municipal affairs. Eventually, Cutting accepts Amsterdam as one of his own, and Amsterdam ascends the ladder of success. He becomes Bill's second in charge. Pretty pickpocket Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz of ""There's Something About Mary"") catches the eyes of both Amsterdam and his old pal Johnny Sirocco (Henry Thomas of ""E.T."") but never comes between them for the worse. Imagine Bill's surprise when he learns Amsterdam is the Priest's son.<br/><br/>Thinly etched characters and obvious plot contrivances dilute the less than compelling screenplay by film critic Jay Cocks of ""The Age of Innocence,"" Steve Zaillian of ""Schindler's List,"" and Kenneth Lonergan of ""Analyze This."" Never should the villain eclipse the hero as 'Butcher Bill' does Amsterdam! The writers develop their villain with greater substance, stature, and ambiguity. Meanwhile, DiCaprio's shallow, one-dimensional Irish hero blends into the background. Simply said, Day-Lewis Cutting radiates more charisma than Amsterdam. After Amsterdam infiltrates Cutting's ranks, the two adversaries behave like father and son. Amsterdam's ""Hamlet"" like indecision to kill Bill bogs down the action. Desperately, the writers turn up the heat in a contrived romantic subplot between DiCaprio's Amsterdam and Diaz's Jenny to compensate for their colorless hero.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Gangs"" resembles a Spaghetti western with its revenge story set east of the Mississippi River. Incidentally, Scorsese lensed this lavishly produced opus on the back lot of Rome's legendary Cinecitta Studios with 19th century New York City recreated at the cost of $110 million dollars. Ambitious, provocative, off-beat, but excessively long, ""Gangs of New York ranks more as a triumph of set design and period detail, not overlooking Day-Lewis' exceptional, Oscar-worthy performance as the villain, than an exciting showdown between two titans."

","Bless Harvey Weinstein's twisted little heart. Once again he has presented us with utterly selfish, dislikable people and produced with them a pretty good story.  I felt pretty unmoved by it all, even if I was never bored. This is largely due to Daniel-Day Lewis' phenomenal performance.<br/><br/>I find it mildly amusing that an Italian (Leonard Dicaprio) and a Cuban-Swede (Cameron Diaz) play Irish characters, while Daniel-Day Lewis (an Irishman) plays an Irish-hating American of English descent.<br/><br/>A short synopsis. Daniel-Day Lewis plays the heard of the most powerful gang in the ""Five Points"" section of New York. He kills Dicaprio father (Liam Neeson) during a gang war between the immigrant Irish and the anti-Irish ""nativists."" It was a ""fair fight,"" insofar as Lewis and Neeson had met a formal challenge and Lewis honors Neeson. Nonetheless, 16 years later, Dicaprio plots revenge, becoming Lewis's Lieutenant with a secret plan to kill him during the annual celebration Lewis throws to celebrate and honor Neeson, ""The last interesting man I killed.""<br/><br/>There are really no ""good guys"" in this movie, but I found myself more in sympathy with Lewis than Dicaprio.  Then, as today, American citizens are victimized by greedy politicians and businessmen capitalizing on immigration. This time, of course, it is illegal immigrants. However, who is to say that the ""legal"" immigration of the period wasn't excessive? Certainly, the movie portrays the Irish immigrants as almost entirely composed of thieves, whores and drunkards.<br/><br/>While Lewis can be generous and, even, somewhat forgiving, Dicaprio possesses neither of these qualities. With the assistance of ""Boss Tweed"" (Jim Broadbent, in another great performance), Dicaprio and his Irish supporters steal a sheriff's election, precipitating much of the climatic violence. Diaz plays a whore and a thief, though she is certainly more unselfish than Dicaprio.<br/><br/>Let me compare this, for a moment, with a much better movie, ""Unforgiven"". The moral ambiguity in ""Unforgiven"" is clear, in that there are no ""good guys;"" but, Eastwood's character is avenging two miscarriages of justice, the whore's mutilation and the murder of his friend under the guise of ""justice"". ""Gangs of New York,"" one wonders how New York survived such such predatory and self-destructive people.<br/><br/>The movie boasts a good score, excellent period production values and Scorsese's usual masterful camera movements. Nonetheless, only the historical context and Day-Lewis' remarkable performance kept me involved enough to finish ""Gangs of New York."""
"jackcade","Null","1","1","5 October 2003"," A footnote in history points to the future
","The opening street battle reminds one of the ambush that opened The Wild Bunch - the crash through the shop window a clear allusion - and the aftermath of this same battle reminiscent of that of the Atlanta fire in Gone With the Wind.<br/><br/>Scorsese juxtaposes the violence of mid-1800s New York and the American Civil War. The street riots are a civil war too, the political motivations are interesting particularly as the film seems to describe the gang wars as a baptism of fire for a young nation coming to terms with its multicultural originas.<br/><br/>No Italian gangs here though, but the descendants of the hoodlums of Mean Streets, GoodFellas and Casino would easily fit into the gang milieu already well established before their arrival.<br/><br/>My big question is when is Scorsese going to make his western. The clue was in Cameron Diaz's stated dream to run away with DiCaprio for a new life to San Francisco, albeit via Cape Horn. For anyone who has seen Howard Hawks's Barbary Coast, life may not have been much different for them, but anything could happen when you went west in those days.<br/><br/>Scorsese seems to love westerns - Hawks' Rio Bravo, Ford's The Searchers for example - it would seem logical that he should explore his themes further in this genre. Gangs of New York points the way."
"Okohme","10","1","1","15 March 2003"," Wow
","Again I say wow.  I'm not big on long movies, or historical flicks, or films about war.  This movie, however, is an exception. This move was truly amazing.  This film genuinely moved me.  The story was full and effective and meaningful.  A TRUE rarity in this day and age. Daniel Day-Lewis was powerful and convincing in this role, I was genuinely afraid of his character.  Leo, who I usually find to be over-the-top and false, also shined in the outstanding cinematic masterpiece. In many ways this movie took lesser-known occurrences in the time frame of the Civil war and prepackaged them for consumption by the mass public, without slandering the historical or human value of what happened. I am impressed.  I won't say that Hollywood doesn't make good movies anymore.  Well, not for a while."
"frodofan00","6","1","1","6 February 2003"," Doesn't live up to the hype.
","*Slight SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I actually downloaded this movie because I had it in semi-high expectations. It was nominated for Best Picture, had all these great reviews, and was directed by Martin Scorsese (<---spelling?). I watched it and it all flew out the window. <br/><br/>I guess it wasn't horrible. There was a certain amount of symbolism, and I rated it a 6, but still, the depth wasn't there and I found it to be a bad excuse for gratuetous sex, profanity, violence, and GORE. I was amazed at how bloody it was. There's a point in which you need to call it quits with the fake blood and mangled body parts and instead spend money on something worth while. (Like a better script for one thing.)<br/><br/>Am I the only one who felt cheated by the ending? With the huge battle at the beginning, you were expecting one of an equal, if not larger scale. It just seemed to easy for Amsterdam to finally kill Bill.<br/><br/>
The acting was okay, although Leonardo DiCaprio was in desperate need of a better dialect coach because his accent was just the pits. Daniel Day-Lewis was excellant, but there was something about him that didn't fit right...not sure what it was, but just 'something'...<br/><br/>Bottom line: go see this film if you wanna see blood, profanity, mindless violence and sex, and a horrible excuse for an ending (although the NY skyline views at the very end were quite good...I liked how they kept the Twin Towers in instead of deleting them after 9/11)."

"bix171","10","1","1","26 January 2003"," Technical Virtousity
","Dante Ferretti's overwhelmingly detailed production design (with set decoration by Francesca LoSchiavo and costume design by Sandy Powell) and Michael Ballhaus' masterful tracking camerawork helps push Martin Scorsese's passionate revisionist history of gang wars between Irish immigrants and Americans into greatness. It's one of the few times (his minor period piece `The Age Of Innocence' is another) where Scorsese has relied so heavily on sets and costuming to advance his New York themes (here it's about the city's amalgamation) and it's also one of his most commercial efforts to date: with its big names (Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz) and familiar plot (it's another story of revenge) to attract a mass audience, Scorsese tones down the graphic nature of the tale; while there's plenty of bloodshed, it's far less shocking than the knife-in-the-hand images of `Taxi Driver' and living burial in `Casino'. The story is by Jay Cocks, but the script seems pieced together with individual contributions from Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan and while it does at times meander from incident to incident, it never bores over the course of one hundred and sixty-eight minutes because the violent tension that keeps mounting is mixed with the characters' poverty-stricken despair and the effect, while it comes close, doesn't desensitize you. The performances by the principals are excellent (DiCaprio has an unreadable look in his eyes and makes a great mythic hero and Diaz does well in a role that's underwritten yet touching); and in fact the film's best moment is a quiet conversation in which Day-Lewis describes to DiCaprio his respect for his enemy/counterpart, the noble warrior (DiCaprio's late father, played in the opening section by Liam Neeson). Day-Lewis' penchant for overacting here serves him well; his misguided isolationist anger is balanced by his respect for the rules of combat and he seems to be as concerned with his character's philosophical motivations as much as the violent ones. Scorsese has never overly politicized but he does here and while his sympathies towards the newcomers is obvious and a bit cloying, the indignation he feels about how these peoples were used, relegated to the periphery and then discarded while laying the foundation of today's New York seems a reasonable, justified response. At this point in his career, Scorsese seems to believe he has to make an epic statement about his town and country to give value to his career--he needn't; his body of work speaks for itself--but while this may not be the crowning achievement he wants it to be, its' technical virtuosity makes it quite an impressive achievement in a class by itself."
"Shervin1982","10","1","1","17 January 2003"," Daniel Day-Lewis's performance is fascinating.
","One of the best films made by Scorsese. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a solid performance (one of the best I've seen in years) and ofcourse the direction. What I love about Scorsese is the fact that he makes violence look frightening and that's really how it is, unlike in movies like James Bond series, or XXX that make the audience think of it as funny(cool) scenes, which it really is not. Violence is horrible and that's how it should be pictured, unlike some would say. The movie's powerful scenes performed by Day-Lewis are startling, dazzling and stunning, which at one point was so realistically shocking that stunned me transfixed on the seat for minutes. Certainly an oscar worthy picture."
"boondocksaint20","Null","1","1","3 January 2003"," Very good movie
","Very good movie, but just lacking the added emotion to make it a great movie.  Daniel Day Lewis gives a jaw dropping performance...his demeanor, his expressions, his accent, his actions...all larger than life.  I was totally drawn into his character as he gave the finest acting job that I have seen in many years.  I'm very glad to see him performing once again after a seemingly long hiatus from the big screen since he is a very talented actor.  I must admit, that DiCaprio and Diaz gave very good (but not great) performances as well, but as others have commented, my complaint as well was the lack of emotion.  Leo sure has the charm, and they made him up to look like a sewer rat very well, but he just can't pull off the gritty rage that his character was supposed to have.  Cameron Diaz, usually an actress whom I've grown very tired of seeing playing the same old ditsy blonde chick roles surprised me as the pickpocket/hooker with a heart of gold.  She acted very well, though, like DiCaprio, did not have the added emotion or 'hear me roar' attitude that was necessary of the role.  Day Lewis steals the show, by far, and I hope this boosts his career ten-fold...what can I say, I was floored by his performance, as others have mentioned as well.<br/><br/>The cinematography is superb.  Scorcese hits home with another winning direction style; in your face, and at the same time it shows the full picture of the setting and surroundings.  Absolutely wonderful sets, makeup and costumes.  I was also very impressed with the courage that this film had to mention many historical events that happened but you don't hear about in the history books.  The horrible, class-biased and racist Union conscription, that spared the wealthy from the draft and was targeted against the immigrants and minorities to go and be slaughtered in their place during the Civil War.  Also, the tones of the movie and of the wounded Northern veterans making comments very fervently that the war was not at all fought to free slavery, (but, for the politicians' dreams of Preserving the Union) and the honest way they portrayed Lincoln, the supposed 'Great Emancipator', who was the biggest racist of them all (these facts are all left out of history books), if only they told how Lincoln factually spoke publicly about how he thought minorities were inferior to whites and how he used slave labor to rebuild the White House, it would have been perfect. It goes to show you the lack of respect for human life to ensure a Union victory, and this movie totally portrays this truth.  Overall, I really felt a candle was lit for these people, especially the hardships of the Irish immigrants who were my ancestors, and I am glad to see that all of the minorities were portrayed accurately, showing each of their hardships and oppression.  Though, no doubt, slavery was a horrible thing, indeed, the film shows many other races (Irish, Oriental, Hockneyed-English as well as others, including African Americans) that suffered that are not mentioned nearly as much in the history books.  Bravo, Mr. Scorcese, for having the courage to put these facts on film.  I think everyone can acknowledge that it was a tough time for everyone, at there wasn't one race that was spared from the hell, whether it was from the war of the states or from the war on the streets.<br/><br/>This was a great movie all around, but I had some major complaints with it, especially during the last hour.  There are so many sub-plots that it is hard to understand the point or the actual plot of the story other than to show the hard-ships of the Irish and other immigrants who flocked in droves to New York harbor.  There are many scenes where out of Steps: A, B and C that should have been used to explain where a character(s) is/are and why they're doing what they're doing, Step B is often somehow amateurishly left out.<br/><br/>***MINOR SPOILERS***  The biggest example of leaving the middle step out is towards the end when DiCaprio explains how he can use the increasing numbers of the immigrants as an army and how they need to rile them up to get them to fight...The Step B that is left out is explaining how and why they trusted him so much that they were willing to die under his leadership. I know that there were a lot of reasons why (especially the death of an important leader), but I just wasn't convinced of the comraderie there...there just wasn't any type of Mel Gibson in Braveheart type speech to rally the troops, they just appear at the end when convenient.  This is especially relevant after he was publicly humiliated that his former 'friends' come back to his aid, though they should have known full well that they would be killed too if they were seen with him...but why did they go to him as a leader when he had become a 'shameful' outcast?  And, how did Diaz get his body away from Bill the Butcher?  And how did the police officer/assassin know exactly where to find him, and why was he the only one sent to kill him?  And why was The Butcher taking out his anger for DiCaprio on Diaz's character whom he had raised and loved for over 10 years? These and many more left me puzzled and a little upset...this movie had been nigh perfect up until the second half.  I know, I know, it's just a movie...and if you remain a little ignorant to these questions, you can still enjoy this film.  ***END OF MINOR SPOILERS***<br/><br/>Also, as someone else mentioned, where was all the blood in the opening battle?  You see it towards the climax, but the first minute or two, you see The Butcher cleaning house, and taking out like 10 guys at once and not a drop of blood is spilled.  That's very odd, especially from Scorcese. The ending also fails to convey the release of pure hatred fueled by revenge and the last 'duel' is way too short to be rewarding.  Still, you get the point, I guess.<br/><br/>Despite the complaints I just mentioned, overall, it was one of the best movies I have seen all year.  With the negative aspects, I was going to give this one a high 7 or a low 8, but given the fact that the acting was superb and the cinematography will stay with me for some time, I have to give it a 9, mostly for the replay value and the feeling that this movie was an experience, and not just another film.  Despite the plot holes here and there, I still enjoyed this film almost the entire way through, and for almost three hours, that is an excellent job worthy of a 9 rating. Perhaps the dvd will explain a lot more with deleted scenes.<br/><br/>Pound for pound, another triumph for Scorcese.  He truly delivers an epic story that is unique as it is daring, however, it falls short of being another Godfather or a Braveheart.  Still. very worth seeing and worth owning.  9/10 stars."
"fred-287","Null","1","1","22 December 2002"," Taking the Mickey Out of History
","For those unfamiliar with this expression, ""taking the mickey out of"" something means kidding it, spoofing it, ""having it on.""  In it's origins, of course, it was yet another slur against the Irish.  This film draws upon a real-life historical situation, i.e. Irish immigration and slum life in New York in the 1840s and later (as documented by Charles Dickens in ""American Notes,"" among others) and a real-life event, i.e. the ""draft riots"" in New York in 1863 that turned into race rioting between the Irish and the blacks, and presents a dramatic tale intertwined with the American Civil War, the greatest intranational cataclysm in our brief history. It's an ambitious undertaking, to say the least.<br/><br/>Our ""hero"" is the son of a murdered Irish-American gang leader called ""Priest"" (the great Liam Neeson in too short a role) whose ""Dead Rabbits"" are seen preparing for battle in some endless catacombs under the slums. Martin Scorsese's trademark fluid camerawork is put to good use as the gang members march along underground until they kick out a door to emerge into a snow-covered street--New York's ""Five Points"" neighborhood, 1846.  (Nice to see a movie with actual physical sets, not computer generated.)  There follows a brutal battle with a gang of ""natives"" led by the chameleon-like Daniel Day-Lewis.  (It took me a while to get used to Day-Lewis' accent, especially since no other character has one like it.)  After the battle we jump ahead 16 years just as Priest's son, who has become Leonardo Di Caprio, emerges from a prisonlike orphanage.  On his way back home to Five Points he flings his Bible into a river, yet later he seeks solace in religious rituals, thus displaying the ambivalence toward religion that's a common theme in Scorsese's films.<br/><br/>Scorsese's narrative approach resembles that of his masterpiece ""Goodfellas"" with the voice-over and the quasi-documentary introduction to the local characters.  ""Then there were the Plug Uglies, they spoke their own language...""  The period recreation is sufficiently fascinating (hats off to Italy for being so accommodating) complete with period slang (""You needed sand to be a turtledove"") that for a while it's enough to follow along without worrying about the plot too much.  The movie's trailer suggested this is a revenge story but the hero, who's called Amsterdam for some reason, doesn't seem to be in any big hurry with his revenge, even coming under the wing of the same gangster who killed his father and now seems to be the ""Don"" of the neighborhood.  For a while we're not even sure he still wants revenge, which I enjoyed, because in ""real life"" we're also not always entirely sure what we want, or how to go about it.  Inevitably a romantic element arises, then the plot wheels start to grind.<br/><br/>This is when ""Gangs"" starts to feel forced, as all the elements need to mesh in a timely manner.<br/><br/>
****  POSSIBLE SPOILERS FROM HERE ONWARDS ******<br/><br/><br/><br/>
The jump-start comes when Amsterdam's pallid friend Johnny gives away his true identity to Bill ""the Butcher,"" apparently because the beautiful pickpocket whom he'd courted chose Amsterdam instead.  This made me groan a little; I mean jeez, it's SUCH a movie commonplace, how we male people supposedly think with our reproductive organs.  It doesn't seem to occur to our Johnny that he'll be killed one way or another, so maybe he IS thinking with his ""little head.""  The Butcher then becomes very surly but allows his duplicitous protege to live so that, of course, the movie's opening scene can be reprised.  But by now we also have the Big Historical Events going on, and shortly there is so much violence from so many quarters--the two gangs preparing to rumble, and the race riots, and the Civil War, and windows breaking, and cannons going off, and beatings and lynchings and stabbings and shootings and bashings--that what emerges is not so much catharsis as shellshock.  When it finally comes down to the two crippled warriors blearily staring each other down through the gunsmoke, it's almost a relief knowing one or both of them will finally die.  The ending, a series of fast-forward dissolves reminiscent of ""Zardoz"" and others, is definitely a ""downer,"" but at least exudes a kind of calmness.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Less would have been More here.  The story we thought we saw outlined in the trailer would have been plenty involving, as was Henry Hill's story in ""GoodFellas,"" and all the social commentary could have ensued from it.  Too many characters jockey for prominence here.  For a while it seems to be Amsterdam's movie, and then Bill the Butcher's, and then William ""Boss"" Tweed's and then someone else's.  Someone like Robert Altman can pull off such a kaleidoscopic effort because an Altman flick is like a jazz tune, each element being a riff, but for the detail-obsessed Scorsese, each element gets the full orchestration treatment.  He doesn't know how to soft-pedal anything.  Insofar as he was working from a story by the visionary former film critic Jay Cocks, he would have been well served to remember a movie from 1955 called ""Night of the Hunter"" with a script by visionary former film critic James Agee that novice director Charles Laughton honed into an intimate little story over which the gloomy Depression stuff loomed without being obtrusive.  ""Gangs"" cries out for this kind of intimacy.  I'm profoundly sorry someone like Paul Schrader wasn't available to write the screenplay, but I guess he was busy with ""Auto Focus.""<br/><br/>Fine acting all around.  Day-Lewis' melancholy monster is the character you'll remember most.  Some have griped that Cameron Diaz looks too good, but hey, this is (the spirit of) Hollywood, get over it.  (Does anyone remember Scorsese's ""New York New York""?  Even his indie stuff was stylized. He was never Mr. Realism.)  Some have griped about the accents.  Well, Di Caprio and Diaz were supposed to be ""Irish-American"" not Irish and anyway, who really knows how anybody sounded in the era before voice recordings? As always with Scorsese, there's effective editing and  use of music and pull-no-punches violence both physical and verbal---and yeah, they did use the F-word even back then.  And that camera work--I just need to mention one shot where we see a line of new Union soldiers marching along , the camera follows them backwards up to their boat and then up and back and over back to the docks where we see a coffin being unloaded from the same boat, pull back to see a line of coffins on the same dock--it's only a minute or two in length, it's visual poetry and it speaks volumes.  God bless you, Martin, you are the ONLY director whose name alone will get me into a movie theater.<br/><br/>
The novel ""Andersonville"" by MacKinlay Kantor has a hellish subplot about New York gangs from this same era.  ""And if they ever hang me, they'll have to hang me twice...."""

","Seems to me like there are mixed reviews about this movie. Well being a fan of scorsese, a history buff, and film violence etc. I set out to see this at its first showing at 12:15 at my new local theater. Now for all you people that want awesome character development, deep motives that you cleary understand and are spelled out and a romantic story and some grand epic like something David Lean did. Well you can just not go see this... Its not that kindav movie. If anything this reminds me of how they use to make epic films like the early 50's . What this reminds me of is mostly Sergio Leone movies (my personal favorite director)and the first 10 minutes were outstanding. After the Dead Rabbits come out to fight and stand in the street there is this great shot of paradise square. All you hear is the wind blowing and the streets are empty like those older western movies. The camera stays in position and out of a run down/burnt down building one by one the Nativists gang slowly creep out lead by the awesome Bill the Butcher (Lewis in a great role). They all have on their top hats with royal blue hat bands and royal blue sashes. Snow covers the ground. Bill's foot steps down and digs into the snow covered ground then kicks it behind him like a bull about to charge. The camera pans up and there he is in his big overcoat and great hat. It reminds me of ""Once Upon A Time In The West"" how that gang wear their big overcoats. OUTSTANDING! just like Leone would have done it... accept this had less glances and no big close ups :( . The film cuts to 16 years later and there is Leonardo Dicaprio. He fits the part of a tuff irish guy who is in his early twenties. Cameron Diaz is fine in a part that anyone could have played. The art direction/set decoration was great! Should win the oscar. The editing alright, Costumes awesome. Cinematography has its lil moments but nothing too incredible. Acting is good overall. I can't complain I loved this movie and will see it again. People don't knit pick this to death. That will ruin any movie. Don't expect stuff like scorsese has done before. As for people who like to complain about Intrussive music. Don't watch a Sergio Leone film cause the music is a huge part of it. Scorsese was trying to go for the opera like story. Please people stop complaing I'd love ten movies like this a year instead of the crap Hollywood has been churning out. This movie is really a western ...that takes place in New York. I enjoyed it alot. Don't expect this to be like other Scorsese movies. And violent. Not really not guts spilling out or knifes entering wounds. Or any alot of blood. Too bad. This isn't as violent as Saving Private Ryan's opening scene or Braveheart. Go see this its definately worth a look and don't knit pick it to death enjoy the experience..cause its another world. Keep up the good work Mr. Scorsese!May you get your oscar.. even if it is a pity oscar (Like Newman for Color of Money)"
"jdesando","Null","1","1","13 December 2002"," The film should be seen, all 168 minutes, if you care about the arc of this director, the history of New York, and the amazing gifts of Daniel Day-Lewis.
","It's 1863 New York City, prior to Rudy Giuliani and well on its way to being anarchic and lawless beyond any modern imagining. The underworld is ruled by Billy the Butcher, played with cunning, humor, and ruthlessness by Daniel Day-Lewis in an Oscar-possible performance. Leo DiCaprio will win no awards as the vengeful Irish orphan, Amsterdam, but he comports himself well enough to be taken seriously as an actor.<br/><br/>The re-creation of 19th century New York at the Cinecitta Studios in Rome is filled with soot, clogged with humans, and choked with detritus to make it both ugly and fascinating.  Director Martin Scorsese's seasoned hand takes a cue from Howard Hawks' `Searchers' by opening a door and letting the point of view camera marvel at the snow-flaked town to be irrevocably changed by the clash of Irish immigrants, led by DiCaprio's dad, Liam Neeson, with nativists, led by the wily Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>DiCaprio will try to avenge his dad's death, with the help of a resourceful and randy pickpocket, played with gusto and charm by Cameron Diaz. The revenge is the plot linchpin and its weakness, for it regularly telegraphs the next anti-climax and takes precious emphasis away from development of interesting characters like Day-Lewis, Diaz, and the talented Jim Broadbent as the infamous political sidewinder, Boss Tweed.<br/><br/>The rivalry leads to the worst riot in American history, the Draft Riots, a preeminent holocaust that destroyed much of Manhattan at the hands of mobs and navy guns, even the homes of prominent businessmen and publishers. Amid the carnage, made even fouler by The Butcher's surpassing ability to eviscerate pigs and men alike, there seems little hope, except for someday a century and an half later a mayor with guts and cold compassion. Until that time, that great city accepted its pickpockets, prostitutes, and politicos as part of its landscape, caught powerfully by the genius director of `Taxi Driver' and `Goodfellas' among other urban stories.<br/><br/>The film should be seen, all 168 minutes, if you care about the arc of this director, the history of New York, and the amazing gifts of Daniel Day-Lewis. Leo can wait."
"DreyersOrdet","Null","1","1","5 December 2002"," Directed to the hilt . . .
","knifeblade and otherwise. I suppose it's too early for a review, but I'll give it a shot and let the more logorrheic shred this as they might. Let's get this demotic party started. Saw it at a DGA preview in NYC--the words ""epic,"" ""bloodbath,"" and ""shambles"" come to mind. And that's just getting into the screening.<br/><br/>Here are a few impressions from having seen the film, inconclusive, and in no real order:<br/><br/>1. Scorsese is very forthright about his debt to Italian neo-realism (Visconti et al.), and the film is directed within an inch of its life. Not quite as dense and sickening as Age of Innocence's endless homage to the feast scene at the end of The Leopard, but still. Dolly shot cuts to dolly shot cuts to a dolly shot that turns into a whip zoom of a fight. Virtuosic, but what for?<br/><br/>2. Daniel Herschel-Gordon-Lewis deserves a Nobel Prize for acting. Bill Cutting supplants any Hollywood baddie you care to name as far as complexity and character is concerned, including every adolescent's favorite cannibal analyst. Scorsese spoke after the screening, and likened the Bill the Butcher character to some Melville he had been reading. It's very appropriate, and I could only wish for more of it (Melville) in films.<br/><br/>3. The movie's narrative trajectory is a bit off, with a climax (The hallucinatory ""Butcher's Apprentice"" scene) about two-thirds into the film. It goes a bit haywire in the end, with the characters becoming tiny parts in the sweep of history (think Bertolucci's 1900, but with smaller flags), but it's still very enjoyable.<br/><br/>4. Oh yeah. Leo. Good enough. The Darwinian grief muscle between his brows was working overtime. A callow youth playing a callow youth (with a vendetta).<br/><br/>5. The pop music DOES NOT WORK HERE. Pax Vox.<br/><br/>6. The tapestry doesn't really hold as dramatic narrative, but it's a heartfelt work of film art.<br/><br/>7. The daguerrotypes of Matthew Brady or Nadar that are shown near the end, of Union casualties of the Civil War, were somehow more immediate in their feeling. By that I guess I mean less mediated, less theatrical, and after so much the film puts you through, to realize that it is just theater is a jarring thing. The pictures have more impact than the film.<br/><br/>8. Damn but I hope this sumbitch makes some money."

","With an all-star cast, 97 million dollars in the budget and Martin Scorsese as the director, how can this movie NOT be a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I saw this movie at a directors pre-screening in Los Angeles and was totally dazzled by the storyline and the reality of the characters. Gangs of New York basically takes the audience back into the pre-modern days of New York and its surrounding areas. It gives us a look back on how gangs use to operate and how they are somewhat the same today.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is simply marvelous as Jenny Everdeane, while Daniel Day-Lewis (in this movie he looks like a pre-historic Brad Pitt) looks a little shakey but still good as Bill the Butcher. Leonardo DiCaprio (looking like an older version of Robbie G. Tomlin) should earn his way back into Hollywood's elite with a solid performance as Amsterdam Vallon.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York was a little slow at times, and in some scenes, a little rough around the edges, but it totally comes together for a great piece of cinema. This movie was totally an artful masterpiece and should be on the tip top of director Martin Scorsese's resume.<br/><br/>Overall a 9 1/2 out of 10! An artful, dramatic movie!"

The movie was off to a good start with one good fighting scene at the beginning and after that it was just complete bordom throughout the whole film. For one thing it was just the same stuff throught the whole film, walking through the manhattan streets and crimes being commited by the Bad guy and loving the girl, and it just repeats itself for 3 hours of bordom. It was just so bad I wanted to get out of the theatre and I almost fell asleep. Leonardo is a D+ graded actor just to let you know. Leonardo did not want to have love in this film but the writers made him have it because they don't care about the sake of movies. Collin Ferrell who is in Phone Booth and Daredevil would had played a much better character since he has the irish background that would suit the irish character. What was so bad about this film also was that there should have been a fight between Daniel-Day Lewis and Dicaprio but it didn't happen. This movie talks about the history of lower manhattan. If you want to know the history of New York watch New York subway stuff, that is better than this deadly garbage bordom. Or spend $2.00 on a token and ride the New York Subway, at least it better than spending $15.00 dollars on this bordom. There is also one good thing about which talks about the change of Manhattan and they showed the twin towers because they were built in 1973 and later destroyed in 9-11/2001.<br/><br/>I recommend that you avoid this film and make any excuse not to see it, IT IS BEYOND BAD!     <br/><br/>Buy a PC computer and play Gangsters 2 and also watch Terminator, Lord of the Rings and Jackie Chan films those are much better than this vile garbage.<br/><br/>ZERO out of Ten for such a garbage film."

I said that's fine, I didn't even bother to do any research (HUGE mistake) I just looked to see when it was playing and took her.

At the end of the movie, I could care less if he survived or died. Cameron Diaz's character was tacked on and useless. If the movie focused more on Bill the butcher and followed his story arch, I would have like the movie a lot more. The movie would have been more engaging.

","7.3/10? An epic? A masterpiece? I must have seen a different a movie. Now, I might be some uncouth lout who seems to watch nothing but action and horror movies, but I also enjoy studying history, and so when I was told that I would enjoy this because it is some 'historical epic' that starts off with a bloody battle, I just could not resist. I got screwed over. 'Gangs of New York' ended up being one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I wish could discern a story in this. I really do. I am interested in studying history, but I know nothing of American history. Apparently in the 1860s, certain sections New York were run by criminal gangs. I can only assume that not much has changed, thanks to much more entertaining movies like 'Escape From New York' and a little known Italian movie called '1990: The Bronx Warriors'. Against a backdrop of gang-warfare and the American civil war, Leonardo DiCaprio does what he does worst: acting. For two and a half hours, apparently seeking vengeance against Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis), the man who murdered his father, with Cameron Diaz thrown in for eye-candy.<br/><br/>Why does this need to go for over two and a half hours? Why bother with dragging something out with all sorts of themes and historical backdrops when you can have a simple 90 minute story of vengeance. That would suit me fine considering that '90 minute revenge story' could describe any number of old kung-fu movies from Hong Kong, all of which are more entertaining than 'Gangs of New York'.<br/><br/>More importantly, why Leonardo DiCaprio? Out of all the movies he has done, this one suits him the least. At least his fake Irish accent is funny. Cameron Diaz also fakes an Irish accent, and hilarity ensues. Her character seemed totally useless, except to attract more of a male audience, because we all know the action in this couldn't possibly do that alone. Daniel Day-Lewis is pretty good. In fact, he spends the whole movie wearing a top-hat, much like my hero Slash. If Slash had appeared in this, 'Gangs of New York' would have been a much better movie. Starring Slash, and directed by Sam Raimi. I can imagine the awesomeness now.<br/><br/>I swear, Martin Scorsese must have convinced all the real movie-critics that he is some sort of infallible movie-God, but he can't fool me. Welcome to my world, Mr. Scorsese, the world of awesome. A world where your classic movies stand on the same level as the awesome-movies I generally enjoy, and where 'Gangs of New York' is a movie equal to 'Batman & Robin', only less entertaining.<br/><br/>'Gangs of New York' is long and boring, with no redeeming qualities at all. It may be enjoyed by film-students or unquestioning fans of Scorsese, but not me. Call me low-brow, but I know what I like, and this ain't it - 3/10"

","After delaying release for nearly a year, the only message most properly conveyed by this patronizing, colloquial, two-hour-forty-five-minute, nonsensical film is that too many cooks spoil the broth.  What started out as a riveting story dealing with love, ethnicity, and family, turned into an unsubstantiated testimonial on American patriotism and the disgrace of upper-class domination.  Please understand, there is nothing wrong with making a movie with these always-important social themes, but to convert them from backdrop to centerpiece in the middle of the movie was one of the worst cinematic mistakes ever conceived.  The onscreen chemistry between DiCaprio and Lewis was successfully diverting my attention away from Leo's `Irish' accent, which he picked up by way of Yorkshire and Australia.  The supporting characters portrayed by Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, and John C. Reilly were well established and intriguing.  This then all fell apart during the end of the second hour as characters went by the waste side and plotlines vanished as the epic story of retribution was conquered by cannonballs - literally.  I urge any who read this who have not yet see this movie to spend your earnings on other cinematic adventures or at least give it to charity."

Way too long, lacking in any kind of continuity, historically muddled, pointless love story, weak lead performance,laughable ending... perhaps I was looking forward to seeing this too much so I was always going to be disappointed, I don't know. Day-Lewis is watchable but hams it up; I suppose an over-the-top character like Bill the Butcher invites a hammy performance. Di Caprio looks out of place with his bumfluff beard and moustache combo, whilst the rest of the cast is underused. Perhaps it should have been the four hours that Scorsese apparently wanted it to be, it might have worked better, but the 2 3/4 hours that it is currently playing at are a waste of time. A great shame, because it's a very little known period of American history which this movie does nothing to help. I've no idea how this has managed to get a rating of 7.6/10, but I'll gladly reduce that by awarding it 0/10. And it's lucky to get 0."

","Possible spoiler alert<br/><br/>I AM a great fan of Martin Scorsese's normally excellent movies but this one falls flat in a spectacular fashion. Problems: 1 The laughable costumes of the gangs. I have no doubt that the gangs at the time did dress kind of outlandishly and I am prepared to concede that research about this was probably quite thorough. BUT, and this is a big BUTT, how can the costumes in this period piece of rubbish almost always look like they've just come from a clothes stand of costumes made for this movie. They all look brand new most of the time despite the filth in which these unfortunate individuals spend their miserable lives. 2 the excruciatingly boring ""love story"" between the diCaprio and Diaz characters. There was nothing convincing about this at all 3 at 2'46"" the movie is at least an hour too long - I was bored s**tless after 45 minutes but watched this tripe to the end only because I believe no-one who hasn't watched a movie from start to finish has a right to grade it, let alone write a review 4 like others, I don't have a problem with violence in movies if the violence is in context and believable. This one is violent for the sake of violence it seems to me in an effort to take focus off the fact that it's a turgidly told, thoroughly predictable and boring story. 5 while Daniel Day Lewis is undoubtedly a fine actor, he is far from convincing as Bill The Butcher Cutting. His American accent must be a bit of an embarrassment to genuine Americans; Hell, I could do a better American accent myself and Scorsese could have had me for peanuts. How surprising is it that this movie was made by a master director and concerns a similar period in American history to Scorsese's thoroughly wonderful ""Age of Innocence"". The disparity in quality between Age of Innocence and this very poor movie couldn't be more stark. So, forget this piece of rubbish and watch Age of Innocence instead. You'll gain a lot from that one and nothing at all from this. JMV"

The setting is pretty dull, too many people fill the screen, and there's violence, and pretty gratuitous violence at that. Martin Scorcese is among my favourite directors, and it's still hard to believe that he made this tripe, but then, people do make mistakes. He was probably doing some experimenting of some sort.

"buiger","3","4","11","9 January 2005"," A waste of almost 180 min of celluloid...
","To me the film was a total flop. Sitting through almost three hours of this movie was not easy. For starters, the story is practically non-existent, especially for a film lasting almost 3 hours. It is overly simplistic, the dialogs are only basic, there is nothing of substance there. All this could have been easily made to fit into a 90-minute film and would probably have been much more effective. In addition, the characters, the set and the filming are more like a cartoon than a film trying to depict reality, totally unbelievable. If it wasn't for all the blood and butchery that is omni-present, one would think this is a ""cartoonesque"" adaptation of an 18th century child novel aimed at semi-retarded kids. Finally, as mentioned above, there are far too many gory scenes of gratuitous violence (and I am really not one to shun violent scenes if they serve a purpose). All in all, I don't know what Scorcese had in mind when he was making this movie. To me it just doesn't make any sense at all."

","One thing I can definitely say for Scorsese in this film, is that he knows how to START! GANGS OF NEW YORK has one of the best opening scenes of a movie that I've seen. It's up there with the likes of THE DARK KNIGHT and THE GREATEST SHOWMAN in terms of a best opening scene. It both grips and sets the tone of the entire movie: muscular, stoic and violent with the epic 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) marching to war with his Irish gang of street warriors ""The Dead Rabbits"" and his young son Amsterdam (Cian McCormack) to do battle with the vicious Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his racist army of American ""Natives"". I must say I found this film really quotable as well and now, every time I cut myself shaving (accidentally), I find myself repeating the line ""No Son! Never! The Blood Stays On The Blade!"" The film REALLY gets off to a great start with this opening scene that leads up to a brutally bloody battle for the Five Points. It's in this first part, that the movie is at its strongest, but as the film progresses with Amsterdam as a grown man (Leonardo DiCaprio) returning to the Five Points for revenge on ""The Butcher"" who slew his father, that the film's structure and pace begins to weaken. <br/><br/>The violent, epic events of the beginning, are replaced with duller, less-gripping ones and a truly disappointing and underwhelming finale, that leaves you a little cross that you wasted all that time waiting for the clash of the titans that never came! It does thrill at some points with the odd ""Butcher"" assassination attempt and the hero (DiCaprio) coming about as close to death as a hero has ever come in movie history. <br/><br/>Scorsese also (in my opinion) delivers a really authentic and thorough look into 19th century life in the Five Points. Everything from the props, to the buildings, to the clothes is spot-on for detail and highly authentic. The period drama side of things is faultless with the film capturing all the attitudes and feelings of the period and introducing us to a fairly unknown side of American history (Gangs in the Five Points and the Draft Riots). This is all fine but it's safe to say that the film is carried by its cast and I have chosen the 3 standouts and the 1 absolutely awful performance: Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz and Jim Broadbent. <br/><br/>DiCaprio is (as usual) convincing, as Amsterdam despite the muddled accent and brings real emotion and passion to the role, unfortunately the character (on a whole) is rather bland and very dull. There's nothing exciting about him as a character, even though DiCaprio does his best in the role. Now, on to Daniel Day-Lewis as ""The Butcher"" Bill. This film (like THE DARK KNIGHT) is a good example of a supporting actor TOTALLY stealing the show. Day-Lewis delivers (in my opinion) one of the best performances of his career as Bill. Like Heath Ledger's Joker there are two, brilliantly-acted sides to his antagonist. On one hand he's a vicious, psychotic, racist, cowardly, backstabbing brute, but, on the other hand, he's a true patriot and a fairly ""honourable man"". Both sides to Bill's personality are played brilliantly and Lewis's sudden changes in character (see the ""Poor Little Rabbit"" scene) are frankly awesome! Cameron Diaz was also very convincing as the film's main heroine Jenny Everdeane. Diaz adds dome real spice to this role and (in my opinion) saves the character from being lost among so many forgettable screen damsels. She's feisty and fun but also caring and soft-spoken. Diaz certainly proves what a versatile and strong actress she is. Then, there is the one performance that both annoys and puzzles me: Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed. I simply don't know what Scorsese was thinking in casting Broadbent in the role. Broadbent is awful, totally wooden and unrealistic. He READS the part, and it baffles me how he got this part among such a stellar cast in the first place. However, along with the likes of Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly the cast, for the most part, uplifted the rather dull 3/4s of the film and made it a slightly more enjoyable ride.<br/><br/>However, the final quarter of the film was what REALLY disappointed me. The problem is: Scorsese spends far too much on time on Amsterdam's saga of ""do I""-""don't I"" and the complete inessentials of the plot so that, as he crams in 'Monk' McGinn (Gleeson) running for sheriff, the Draft Riots and another Battle for the Five Points, the film becomes convoluted and terribly rushed. Things certainly needed to be trimmed down here, (I think) Scorsese just needed to synchronise the conclusion better. The conclusion itself was (as I've said) a true disappointment and doesn't deliver the outcome you hoped for (or watched the rest of the movie for). <br/><br/>Certainly mixed goods. The acting, beginning and script= goods. Bad= plot, pace and finale. Scorsese can do better and I was left thinking the film could have been better. Much better..."
"classicsoncall","8","2","4","10 September 2017"," ""The appearance of the law must be upheld, especially while it's being broken.""
","The story takes place during an era of American History that's generally overlooked in the history books, beginning in 1846 (for the opening sequence) through the early part of 1863 with the Civil War in progress. Some of the film deals with the New York City draft riots that occurred when Congress passed a conscription law, but the overarching story deals with the revenge sought by Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) some sixteen years after seeing his father murdered by Native gang leader, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel-Day Lewis).<br/><br/>For those of faint heart and weaker stomach, it's not an easy picture to watch with the amount of violence and bloodshed, dealt out by individuals with little regard for humanity. Alliances are switched by members of the former 'Dead Rabbits' gang after their leader, Vallon's father 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) is killed in a street brawl. It occurred to me at one point that the roles of Neeson and Day Lewis could have been reversed, that's how much they resembled each other as gang leaders.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't rate that highly here on IMDb with a fair number of detractors in the reviews section. That surprises me somewhat, as the story is gripping from a historical perspective, and the performances by the principals are more than adequate. Because the film's locations are situated primarily in a congested area of the City known as The Five Points, you don't have the epic sweep of more highly regarded films like ""Gone With the Wind"", but that's a minor point. For me, the picture opened up an era of American History worthy of further study that was bypassed during my own education. It looks like I'll be spending some time there learning about The Tammany Hall years and the corruption that took place under the regime of Boss Tweed."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","2","4","24 October 2011"," What an odd, odd film.
","The first time I saw this movie was years ago but I decided not to write a review about it back then, since I felt that this movie had to be seen again before I could form a judgment about it. There had to be something I was missing and thought I might appreciate it way better the second time around. But no, my opinion really hasn't changed about it, now that I have seen the movie again.<br/><br/>Of course I love Martin Scorsese just as much as any other movie lover but that doesn't mean I'm also in love with all of his projects. Yet this was a movie that got received well by most other critics at the time. Perhaps people were too scared to admit that the great Scorsese had delivered two disappointing movie project in a row, in a few years time. His previous movie ""Bringing Out the Dead"" was not received too well (which was a movie I still really liked by the way) and it was as if the movie world simply wouldn't accept the next great Scorsese project to be a failure as well. People were hungry for a great Scorsese again and it seemed like most minds were made up already before ""Gangs of New York"" got finally released. Same thing sort of happened with ""The Departed"", with as a big different that that movie indeed was a great one.<br/><br/>But really, in all fairness and objectivity, this just isn't a great film. I really blame it on the concept, since it's also obviously hard to blame the talent behind the camera's or any of its magnificent cast-members.<br/><br/>I just never understood Scorsese's fascination and passion for this project. He wanted to make this movie ever since the '70's but due to various different reasons it never fell through. I really don't understand this, since the concept of the movie is such a weird one and not in a good or fascinating kind of way. A bunch of lawless bums battling each other to the death in the streets of early New York? I don't really see the appeal of it to turn this into an historic drama. Yes, I know this all in one way or another got based on facts but that doesn't make the movie any more interesting to watch. It's just an odd concept, that doesn't appeal to me in any way.<br/><br/>Because of this, I couldn't ever take interest in the story and anything that was happening in it, as well as for its characters, which I couldn't care less about really. And there really is no good reason for this movie to be nearly 3 hours long. It's just long because it wanted to be epic but it doesn't add much to the movie or its story really. Not that you'll easily get bored by this movie though. There still is plenty happening and the actors make sure you keep watching till the end.<br/><br/>It's a movie that is much better known and appreciated due to its acting really. Daniel Day-Lewis is of course perfect, in his first movie role since his early retirement, which lasted only a few years. It doesn't matter who or what he plays, he also makes sure he totally becomes the character and puts everything into it. And yes, Leonardo DiCaprio was also quite good and this movie perhaps was the one in which he showed the world what a great talent he was. There were still a lot of nay-sayers at the time, which had everything to do with his role in ""Titanic"" and how much some people hated that movie. It's also a movie with a real solid supporting cast in it, that is also filled with big names, such as Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Liam Neeson and Brendan Gleeson.<br/><br/>Thing that didn't worked out, which involved the movie its actors was the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. There absolutely was none really and you should wonder if this movie and its story actually did require to have a love story weaved into it. It probably could had made the movie a much shorter and more pleasant one if it got left out. It didn't really seem to suit the story in the first place anyway.<br/><br/>On a more positive not again; thing that obviously stands out about this movie are its visuals. They very obviously did a great job with recreating the New York of mid-19th century. The movie has a very distinctive look and feeling to it, which is all due to the authenticity of it. The sets, make-up and costumes all really help to make this movie a visual spectacle and next to its acting, is the best thing about this movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm still missing something but this is far from a great, interesting or entertaining movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>6/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

With Daniel Day-Lewis leading an outstanding cast that includes Leonardo Dicaprio, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, Liam Neeson, Brendan Gleeson, and John C. Reilly, there's no going wrong. Lewis is spellbinding in the semi-central role and the epic sweep is outstanding. Scorsese normally makes films not normally associated with epics, but this time he does and the gamble pays off.

He was so intense and gave a wonderful performance.<br/><br/>But the film is more than good performances. The sets are wonderful. It look so real. An old New York was found in Italy. And I don't need to say that Scorcese is a master in cinema. <br/><br/>I was sad to find out that this film did't won an Oscar but anyway a film doesn't need an Oscar to be a masterpiece! <br/><br/>And Daniel Day-Lewis became now my favourite actor with his intensive performance.

"dead47548","9","2","4","18 December 2007"," Grandiose.
","While I do have some complaints with the way that Scorsese handled the film's style I found it to be a very enjoyable film highlighted by one of the finest performances of all time. The editing during the fight scenes happens way too quickly and becomes convoluted, and the way that he introduced us to the era seemed far too rushed and never really let us understand the surroundings that we were placed in. The script does a good job of explaining the politics of the time period and what was happening in New York at that time in history, but the introduction to it all felt really forced and rushed. But once I got used to that, it was quite easy to immerse myself into the setting. The art direction and costume design is phenomenal and all of the actors do a great job of making us feel like we're there with them.<br/><br/>In order for me to like a film I have to like the story and Gangs of New York has the benefit of being a sensational, almost Shakespearean, tragedy which I absolutely adore. The story centers around Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) who, as a child, sees his father slain in battle by the menacing Bill ""The Butcher"" Cunning (Daniel Day-Lewis). He flees the scene and lives at the church for sixteen years before returning to the place where his father died and is re-introduced to the world that he once knew which is almost exactly the same, with the addition Bill running everything with an iron fist. Amsterdam succeeds in becoming a close associate of Bill's, eventually becoming basically his right-hand man and saving his life at one point. He does all of this for the chance to avenge his father and murder The Butcher in cold blood. As I said, the story is very Shakespearean and that's what I love about it and that's why the ending was a bit of a let-down. It doesn't follow continue with it's tragedy roots and that disappointed me but it was still handled quite nicely.<br/><br/>Of course with Daniel Day-Lewis being my favorite actor and his extremely strong selection process I'm more than likely going to adore his performance, and that's very true for his portrayal of Bill. His brooding intensity, flawless accent and ability to strike cold fear into someone while saying the most polite things truly make it one of the most astonishing performances of all time. Just plain brilliant. Everyone else in the cast is quite nice; DiCaprio is great, Diaz is above average, John C. Reilly and Brendan Gleeson provide fine support but it's ultimately Daniel's show and he amazes us as always. Overall, Gangs of New York really is a great film, regardless of some flaws scattered along the way, which follows a brilliant story and holds one of the finest performances of all time."
"DarrenHorne","5","2","4","7 March 2005"," Interesting, but far from entertaining
","We all heard the rumours that were hurtling around Martin Scorsese's latest film, as the release date was continually delayed and stories of on set tensions were common place. None of that matters, but it did create a great deal of added publicity and anticipation. It is because of this that much of the cinema going public began to expect a popcorn blockbuster. Especially as it stars Hollywood pretty boy Leonardo DiCaprio who is now better known for the prole friendly films, such as Titanic, than his earlier grittier roles. Scorsese's films are often dark and disturbing, with unglamourous violence, in which the narrative is put before entertainment. This is true for Gangs of New York, which is actually a gangland period drama set against the backdrop of the Civil War. It is not a pleasant film to watch, and is a story of revenge and survival. It is also not a noble story of good versus evil, but of petty squabble's over race, colour, religion, politics, power and territory. <br/><br/>It is set in the 19th Century as Irish immigrants escape the potato famine by turning up on American shores in their hordes. This leads to gang wars between the natives, led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), and the Immigrants, led by Amsterdam (DiCaprio), who is also on a crusade of vengeance for his fathers death. The story is told around an overcrowded, corrupt cesspit called Paradise Square, which was actually built as a fantastic, sprawling 2-mile set piece. This set is the best thing about this film, especially when blue screens and computer-generated effects are all the rage. All the actors give fine performances, (although some of the accents do waver occasionally), especially Day-Lewis, who came out of a semi-retirement in which he was working as a Cobbler. Diaz has a strong meaty role which she makes the most of, and is certainly not there just as eye candy, as there is no place for femininity in this squalor. It is a fantastic story that almost feels like a documentary due to the superb attention to detail. It should be watched as a reminder of the darkest sides of human nature, especially as the same bigotry and irrational hate is still a part of all of our lives today. Unfortunately the uncharismatic leads fail to win us over, and we watch out of a morbid fascination that people could actually live like this, instead of caring about the outcome for the characters. There is also the tease of a great gang battle at the end of the film, which is snatched from us in a hail of cannon fire. Perhaps that would have been too much of a Hollywood ending, but I wanted it, and felt cheated as I came out of the cinema. Gangs of New York is a raw look at a brutal moment of history in which the ragged, desperate masses do anything to survive, and are then told to go and fight for the right to starve in the gutter. A powerful film, with a couple of scenes that will haunt you for a long time to come, but I just wanted to be entertained."
"knsevy","5","2","4","18 February 2005"," Useless romantic subplot
","When is Hollywood going to learn? If your story is compelling, and your characters are strong, you don't NEED to insert some useless romantic subplot.<br/><br/>I'll agree on the base with most reviewers who say Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill Cutting stole the movie. I really enjoyed his performance. I think his over-the-top scenery chewing was just what the larger-than-life character of Bill the Butcher called for.<br/><br/>DiCaprio wasn't so bad in his character, but he's just too cute to ever be believable as a street tough. Oh, Diaz? Was she even in this? I was lucky enough to see it the first time in a form in which I could fast-forward through the useless subplot between her and Leo.<br/><br/>I came into this film expecting my weak stomach to be very upset by the violence, but it never really comes home. The brutality of the first gang war was impressive, but it was the only real episode that illustrated the gangs. The film was hit-and-miss, from there.<br/><br/>The filmmakers missed BIG in getting distracted by Amsterdam's romance with that cipher of a woman (Diaz). You can fast-forward through every scene they have and not miss a bit of the movie.<br/><br/>The REAL romance here is between Amsterdam and The Butcher. The filmmakers shied, in fear, from showing the romantic relationship between Amsterdam and Bill. That was what was clearly being built, all the way. But because American audiences are too frightened to accept a male/male romance, they had to throw in that gratuitous hetero romance for Leo. Watch the film; the only logical end is for Bill and Amsterdam to be lovers.<br/><br/>The fact that the moviemakers were too constricted by Amurkan Valyoos to show a homosexual romance between two powerful male characters is what makes the later scenes between Bill and Amsterdam seem so fake. That's also what would explain the strange actions of Bill after the knife-throwing incident, when he knows Amsterdam is plotting to kill him.<br/><br/>Picture: Bill, a vicious man, has Amsterdam in his power, and he knows Amsterdam has been plotting to kill him. So he lets Amsterdam get away with just a burn scar? If Bill wasn't in love with Amsterdam, he would have truly mutilated him - taken an ear, a nose, probably an eye, which would have matched up with Bill's own handicap.<br/><br/>That's where the continuity gap hit hard - and it's not like continuity was being well-served, up to that point. Whether or not you like the idea of Amsterdam and Bill being lovers, Diaz' part was still totally useless, and should not have been in the movie. I'd like to see a version of this film, without her. Yes, and I will go ahead and make the same criticism often heard, on the IMDb: the combat wasn't realistic. I saw in that first battle at least twice as much carnage as showed up, at the end.<br/><br/>If you're gonna be real, be real all the way, like 'Saving Private Ryan'. Don't kill thirty guys in your opening battle, then end it with most of them surviving.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah. There's another point. After Bill throws his knife into Amsterdam's gut? If Amsterdam was wealthy and connected, he would have had a low chance of surviving it. As a poor street person, his chances of surviving after his intestines had been punctured would be nil. Peritonitis would set in, without professional help - and WITH the professional help, of that time, he most likely would still have died. A street kid who'd been stabbed would have just died.<br/><br/>The visuals were great - especially the gangs 'uniforms' in the last scene. The film itself was so disjointed, I'm hoping for better on the DVD - and I'm hoping I can cut out Diaz' scenes. The real romance in this film is between Amsterdam and Bill. Diaz is a cipher."

","For a huge fan of Martin Scorsese like yours truly, the let down of Gangs of NY was even bigger. Where is the tight, efficient Scorsese of yore? Where is the primal scream? It looked like a glossy film on an epic canvas, so I had forgiven much on my way in - this was a big canvas painting and even Scorsese might not be as economical and sharp as he's traditionally been.<br/><br/>From conception to execution this film looked to me like an indulgent party, and Daniel Day Lewis was the one who indulged most and came out triumphant, because it worked for Bill the Butcher! As for everyone else, excuses apart, this really was one hashed up lavish ceremonial orgy of film-making at its worst when more money can actually kill the film instead of giving it more options. Di Caprio is his usual self - a kid trying to fit into a man's boots. Cameron Diaz had a part that would have left the film no poorer had it been left out altogether.<br/><br/>The story was over as soon as the revenge seeking son got close to his father's murderer. But the film went on way past that point. It didn't help that I had seen ""City of God"" in the same week. As if to wash myself off, I saw ""City of God"" again after this grand Scorsese failure. Enough said."
"camachoborracho","8","2","4","26 November 2004"," A little long but very good
","This film will make you feel depressed after watching it - it is just the mood of the film, not the film itself or its message.<br/><br/>The acting was great except for Cameron Diaz (why she was picked to play an Irish pickpocket does not make sense and she cannot fake her accent well - nor Leonardo DiCaprio for that matter), and Daniel Day Lewis definitely was perfect for this role.<br/><br/>The cinematography, editing, sound were all great and conveyed the mood well. The costumes were pretty good but makeup was lacking - everyone still seemed very clean despite the filthy living conditions of the day, although apparently this was the fault of producers and test audiences who felt DiCaprio seemed unattractive so historical accuracy lost there.<br/><br/>On that note, this film does not shy away from violence and corruption which founded America, which is particularly brave considering the times we live in and our fear of admitting we ever did wrong. Some of the fight scenes - in particular the introductory fight - were a little long and overdone but overall they were well done.<br/><br/>This is not Scorsese's best film but it is a good film - as Ebert stated in his review, it would have been a triumph for someone else but compared to his past work it is fairly average (which still means very very good) compared to his other films.<br/><br/>I can't really find anything wrong with this film but it does run long so expect that. Definitely worth a watch for some great performances but not a classic as it is a downer.<br/><br/>OVERALL SCORE: 8 out of 10. Great film so long as you're in the mood."
"MF210","5","2","4","15 September 2003"," A huge disappointment
","My Rating: ** out of ****. <br/><br/>Gangs Of New York was a big disappointment. I am a huge Scorsese fan, but this has to be the worst of his films so far. It has some redeeming qualites but not enough to save it. <br/><br/>The acting is a disappointment, especially for such a good cast. Leonardo Dicaprio is notably miscast, his Irish accent also varies. Daniel Day Lewis is mostly good, but got way too much attention. He occasionally overacts, so im not sure his performance was worth a nomination. Cameron Diaz is also miscast, but I think her character is pretty unneccessary, and I really didnt find much chemistry between her and Dicaprio. <br/><br/>Technical Categories are where Gangs Of New York shines. The Sets are magnificent, the Cinematography is good, and the Costumes are also nice. The Original Song is also great. Gangs Of New York also has some memorabl scenes and is visually stunning, but the script is also weak, the movie is 45 minutes too long, and the acting is a huge disappointment."

","This movie was a recreation of history with a multi-color pallet that doesn't lend itself to realism. The characters are unconvincing for the most part, albeit a decent accent by Dan, Liam and even Leo.  The fight scenes are a bloody work of faux wrestling with missed punches obvious as the bright red dripping from the musty brown landscape.  Still I found a moment or two interesting; the backdrops were especially magnificent, though perhaps too well designed in that I never entirely felt I was in the 1800's, just on an expensive set of said era.<br/><br/>I give Gangs a hearty uppercut...without pulling the punch."

","Geez, what a mess. Far too conventional a plot structure for what could have been an interesting take on a fresh time and place. It's as if Scorsese had directed ""Titanic."" The choice of leading man doesn't help in this regard. It takes a lot of the viewer to work through Leonardo's acting problems.<br/><br/>As a period piece it works very well - the set design, costumes, etc. are spot on. Daniel Day Lewis is brilliant here, not wasting the rich character he is given. Other bit parts are not bad, but feel a little tacked-on in spots.<br/><br/>The primary problem, IMHO, is the off-the-shelf plot. It's more Hollywood epic than vintage Scorsese. There are very few surprises here and a lot of disappointment at an opportunity lost."

","What on earth was that? One of the worst films I have ever seen - Marty you can keep my money but you owe me 3 hours of my life!<br/><br/>***spoilers***<br/><br/>The plot was as cliche ridden as it gets - the avenging son, the bad guy with a warped code of honour, the feisty floozy love interest who has history with the bad guy, the double-crossing friend... I could go on.<br/><br/>The plot went nowhere.  You knew what was going to happen 5 minutes in and 3 hours later, it did.  The 2hrs 55 in between was presumably supposed to be character development but did we learn anything about these stereotypes which we hadn't realised 20 seconds after meeting them? Absolutely not.<br/><br/>Somebody really should have informed the writer that it's traditional to make the plot and sub-plot interact in some way: None of the backdrop about the draft or the politics had any relevance to the main story which was essentially a mixture of Titanic and Bloodsport (actually van Damme is probably one of the few actors who would have made a worse fist of Amsterdam than Leo did!)<br/><br/>Finally the acting: Leo needs to learn a new face other than the cheeky-boy grin and the concentrating furrowed brow.  People have raved about Day-Lewis but all I could see was De Niro, who was Scorsese's original choice; he seemed to have been told ""Do it the way Bobby would have"". The movie said nothing, it just occured.  The timing of its release combined with its title and setting might have made it more relevant for some, but without that context it offers nothing.<br/><br/>It did have one effect on me: It was the first time that a film made me angry for how poor it was.

","People were saying Martin Scorsese should have won an Oscar for this film, but let's face it, this is not one of his better movies. Overwrought with pretentious dialogue and sequences, Gangs was a pretty shallow experience after the opening battle between the Irish and Natives. Martin Scorsese definitely deserves some recognition for his work, but giving him an Oscar for this average film would be like giving Mark Wahlberg an Oscar for Best Actor. Maybe it was because Leonardo DiCaprio was in it, which instantly ruins the credibility of most films, or maybe it was the fact that there were too many reshoots. In the end, Scorsese's dream project could have turned into another Heaven's Gate if it wasn't for his more dedicated fans. Let's hope Scorsese bounces back soon."

"shanfloyd","Null","2","4","25 February 2003"," A Complete Movie by Scorsese.
","Analysis of Martin Scorsese's films reveals that like Ridley Scott, Scorsese also is a master of picturesque, artistic violence. ""Gangs of New York"" is a movie set in a time when there were enough such materials. In this film violence rules indifferently, as if this is an usual content of an usual movie. Scorsese masterfully used this post-Lincoln era, when cruelism was the badge of the nation.<br/><br/>This is also one movie that's historically so perfect.... which is quite evident from superb set and costume designing. Under Scorsese's brilliant direction, cinematography was also magnificient. But what prompts you to watch this movie again and again is the performance of the two lead actors. Both Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio acted superbly. Day-Lewis delivered undoubtedly his best performance since ""My Left Foot"". His action, his style to hold the daggers, his way to deliver a speech were so original as Bill the Butcher that it's hard to imagine Day-Lewis without those mushtaches. DiCaprio, though not upto his standard, also gave a fairly good performance. But I somehow have a feeling that DiCaprio didn't quite suit into the role. It's not his acting but his looks what perhaps made me feel this way; Not quite hardened, I suppose. Anyway, what he did was fine. Cameron Diaz was not unimpressive too as the pickpocket.<br/><br/>The original song ""Hands That Built America"" by U2 is a fantastic one. It accurately catches the subtle sad note underneath all the violence in the film. John Williams' score, as usual, probably going to be the best. So, historic storyline, superb acting, brilliant direction, artistic violence, good score and at last, a thoughtful abstract ending sequence. What more can you want? 5/5."

","At times, Martin Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"" does a very convincing impersonation of a great film, but make no mistake, this is no masterpiece. Some strong performances (particularly from Daniel Day Lewis), exqusite cinematography and first-rate art direction do their best to compensate for a plodding, overly ambitious train wreck of a screenplay (somewhat surprising considering it comes from A-list writers Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan).<br/><br/>This film has been a dream project for Scorcese since the late '70s, and while all of his technical brilliance is on display, he never really seems to decide what exactly it is he is trying to say. The disjointed and convoluted story never really seems to have a point. And many of the characters, particularly those played by Leonardo Di Caprio, Cameron Diaz and Henry Thomas, are uncompelling. This is not the fault of the actors. The much-maligned Di Caprio is, in fact, a very talented young actor, as we see from his outstanding performance in ""Catch Me If You Can"" (a film made by Scorcese's only peer, who, unlike Scorcese, is still at the top of his game). It's the fault of the script, which places them in a relentlessly bland and stale revenge plot, and and even more stale romantic triangle. It's also the fault of Scorcese, who doesn't seem to be as interested in the characters as in the overall atmosphere, and in the technical razzle-dazzle of what he's doing with the camera.<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" has a lot going for it, but in the end, it does not work nearly as well as it should.

"stefannemanja7","9","0","0","7 July 2020"," About...
","Martin Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" rips up the postcards of American history and reassembles them into a violent, blood-soaked story of our bare-knuckled past. The New York it portrays in the years between the 1840s and the Civil War is, as a character observes, ""the forge of hell,"" in which groups clear space by killing their rivals. Competing fire brigades and police forces fight in the streets, audiences throw rotten fruit at an actor portraying Abraham Lincoln, blacks and Irish are chased by mobs, and Navy ships fire on the city as the poor riot against the draft.<br/><br/>The film opens with an extraordinary scene set beneath tenements, in catacombs carved out of the Manhattan rock. An Irish-American leader named Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) prepares for battle almost as if preparing for the Mass--indeed, as he puts on a collar to protect his neck, we think for a moment he might be a priest. With his young son Amsterdam trailing behind, he walks through the labyrinth of this torchlit Hades, gathering his forces, the Dead Rabbits, before stalking out into daylight to fight the forces of a rival American-born gang, the Nativists.<br/><br/>Men use knives, swords, bayonets, cleavers, cudgels. The ferocity of their battle is animalistic. At the end, the field is littered with bodies--including that of Vallon, slain by his enemy William Cutting, aka Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis). This was the famous gang fight of Five Points on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, recorded in American history but not underlined. When it is over, Amsterdam disappears into an orphanage, the ominously named Hellgate House of Reform. He emerges in his early 20s (now played by Leonardo DiCaprio) and returns to Five Points, still ruled by Bill, and begins a scheme to avenge his father.<br/><br/>The vivid achievement of Scorsese's film is to visualize this history and people it with characters of Dickensian grotesquerie. Bill the Butcher is one of the great characters in modern movies, with his strangely elaborate diction, his choked accent, his odd way of combining ruthlessness with philosophy. The canvas is filled with many other colorful characters, including a pickpocket named Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a hired club named Monk (Brendan Gleeson), the shopkeeper Happy Jack (John C. Reilly), and historical figures such as William ""Boss"" Tweed (Jim Broadbent), ruler of corrupt Tammany Hall, and P.T. Barnum (Roger Ashton-Griffiths), whose museum of curiosities scarcely rivals the daily displays on the streets.<br/><br/>Scorsese's hero, Amsterdam, plays much the same role as a Dickens hero like David Copperfield or Oliver Twist: He is the eyes through which we see the others but is not the most colorful person on the canvas. Amsterdam is not as wild, as vicious or as eccentric as the people around him, and may not be any tougher than his eventual girlfriend Jenny, who like Nancy in Oliver Twist is a hellcat with a fierce loyalty to her man. DiCaprio's character, more focused and centered, is a useful contrast to the wild men around him.<br/><br/>Certainly, Day-Lewis is inspired by an intense ferocity, laced with humor and a certain analytical detachment, as Bill the Butcher. He is a fearsome man, fond of using his knife to tap his glass eye, and he uses a pig carcass to show Amsterdam the various ways to kill a man with a knife. Bill is a skilled knife artist, and terrifies Jenny, his target for a knife-throwing act, not only by coming close to killing her but also by his ornate and ominous word choices.<br/><br/>Diaz plays Jenny as a woman who at first insists on her own independence; as a pickpocket, she ranks high in the criminal hierarchy, and even dresses up to prey on the rich people uptown. But when she finally caves in to Amsterdam's love, she proves tender and loyal, in one love scene where they compare their scars, and another where she nurses him back to health.<br/><br/>The movie is straightforward in its cynicism about democracy at that time. Tammany Hall buys and sells votes, ethnic groups are delivered by their leaders, and when the wrong man is elected sheriff he does not serve for long. That American democracy emerged from this cauldron is miraculous. We put the Founding Fathers on our money, but these Founding Crooks for a long time held sway.<br/><br/>Scorsese is probably our greatest active American director (Robert Altman is another candidate), and he has given us so many masterpieces that this film, which from another director would be a triumph, arrives as a more measured accomplishment. It was a difficult film to make, as we know from the reports that drifted back from the vast and expensive sets constructed at Cinecitta in Rome. The budget was enormous, the running time was problematical.<br/><br/>The result is a considerable achievement, a revisionist history linking the birth of American democracy and American crime. It brings us astonishing sights, as in a scene that shows us the inside of a tenement, with families stacked on top of one another in rooms like shelves. Or in the ferocity of the Draft Riots, which all but destroyed the city. It is instructive to be reminded that modern America was forged not in quiet rooms by great men in wigs, but in the streets, in the clash of immigrant groups, in a bloody Darwinian struggle.<br/><br/>All of this is a triumph for Scorsese, and yet I do not think this film is in the first rank of his masterpieces. It is very good but not great. I wrote recently of ""Goodfellas"" that ""the film has the headlong momentum of a storyteller who knows he has a good one to share."" I didn't feel that here. Scorsese's films usually leap joyfully onto the screen, the work of a master in command of his craft. Here there seems more struggle, more weight to overcome, more darkness. It is a story that Scorsese has filmed without entirely internalizing. The gangsters in his earlier films are motivated by greed, ego and power; they like nice cars, shoes, suits, dinners, women. They murder as a cost of doing business. The characters in ""Gangs of New York"" kill because they like to and want to. They are bloodthirsty, and motivated by hate. I think Scorsese liked the heroes of ""Goodfellas,"" ""Casino"" and ""Mean Streets,"" but I'm not sure he likes this crowd.<br/><br/>S."
"jacobperkinscc16","7","0","0","4 January 2015"," Overall review of Gangs of New York
","Gangs of New York is a great film showing the turbulent New York City before and during the Civil War. Scorsese makes his movie full of violence, action, and plot twists and still manages to maintain many historical aspects of what New York City was like in the 1860s. He ensures that the viewer feels sympathy for Amsterdam Vallon as he attempts to avenge his father, who was murdered by Bill the butcher, and tries to find his way in the Five Points district. The movie displays Bill as a murderous gang leader who believes in honor and a romanticized view of fighting. The movie condemns this view of fighting as the clash between the two gangs that Bill and Amsterdam, like his Father before him, so eagerly enter results in horrible consequences and many deaths. The movie also displays the historical background and carrying out of the Race Riots which surprisingly ends in a far more catastrophic destruction of much of New York City and many more deaths than I and many others would believe. The army is sent in to stop the gangs and rioters who are protesting mostly due to the first draft in American history. Many buildings are destroyed and many civilians are killed as the national army ends the Race Riots. This is a amazing film which mixes action and history beautifully."

","This film follows a young boy who watches his farther die in a gang fight over the 'five points area' of New york. After returning in 1863 he seeks vengeance on Bill the Butcher by infiltrating his inner circle.<br/><br/>This film was good but no where near as good as I thought and hoped it would be. What I enjoyed was the directing even tho (for me at least) there's many other Martin Scorsese films done better its still extremely good it won him his first Golden Globe for Best Director. The acting by Daniel Day- Lewis playing Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting was nothing short of incredible you get completely engrossed in his character and he completely steals the show for me. You really believe he's a cold hearted killer willing to do anything to get what he wants. He owns the role! Leo's performance wasn't as good as we are now use to from him but for a film he did in the year 2002 it was still very good and I didn't mind his Irish accent and thought it was pretty good. Cameron Diaz was a pleasant surprise as she was really good at her part as well, one of the best performances iv seen from her. The cinematography was very good as well, at times you really felt you were in 1800's New York. Sadly tho as you would expect from a nearly 3 hour long film it did dip a couple of times and you do lose interest. I thought this was due to the story, it wasn't as intriguing as it should of been and only because of the great acting you wanted to keep watching. Due to not seeing him grow up, at all, which i hate to see in movies makes you not really connect with Leo's the character you still care about him but you should be able to really feel the pain he's in and the emotions thats driving him but annoyingly i couldn't do that. Overall this was a good movie but nothing amazing or extraordinary like a lot of Scorsese's other work. On hindsight its a re-watchable film thanks to the incredible acting but not a lot more. 7/10 from me."

","The story goes on nicely, starting off quite slow but gradually building momentum by increasing pace. The story flows in a straightforward line; helps the story to tell itself congruently. The location and sets made are nice, so does the properties played and costume designed. What is worth mentioning above all is the acting overall, which is indeed a great job to see. Her we see Leonardo DiCaprio learning to get into character more totally than what he did in his earlier works. And he learned from few of the best here. We see him here acting with Daniel Day Lewis, who is quite an expert in getting into complex characters such as his in this movie. Daniel Day Lewis kept his character up to the great movie There Will Be Blood (2007). Liam Neeson, although with less significant in frame duration, apparently taught some things about action scenes for the two of them also."

","It's an extremely well done film, but not one of Scorsese's best. His first feature in seven years since ""Casino"" (1995) is a return to top form, however at 2 hours 40 minutes I find that the movie tends to drag on considerably.<br/><br/>Actually this film is the one where I started really enjoying Leonardo DiCaprio as a performer. Sure I liked him enough in ""The Beach"" (2000), but here is where I start to believe his leading man capabilities. I also enjoy Cameron Diaz's performance though I never thought too much of her character, and as much as Daniel Day Lewis is a superb actor I think his performance is sometimes way over the top than memorable.<br/><br/>For as silly as this film can get, it's very well lit and the organisation and scope for some of these fights is undeniably impressive. The last 30 minutes is a spectacle but the ending never got to me, regardless how poignantly it was presented.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It may not be the greatest entry in Scorsese's unbelievable filmography, but this is still worth watching overall. 7/10."

It was all, for the most part, pretty accurate. There were a few anachronisms, but what historical movie doesn't have any? <br/><br/>In conclusion, Martin Scorcese once again did an amazing job.

","Not the best Scorsese flick. Starting with The Departed I became very interested/obsessed with Scorsese's films. It wasn't until The Wolf of Wall Street that I decided to start a Scorsese marathon. Now I haven't watched all of his films, but for me this has to be the one that seems to be the longest, even though Casino was longer I enjoyed it even more than Goodfellas. Some scenes tend to get boring, I place it primarily on Cameron Diaz and some parts to Leo's acting. Every scene in which Day Lewis is in is pure awesomeness. Liam Neeson also provides a great performance, even though he SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!!! dies in the first 15 minutes or so. I would recommend this film for Scorsese fans exclusively,not that other people wouldn't enjoy it, but it doesn't seem to be his best film. This film also marks Scorsese's first collaboration with Leo, which in the ensuing collaborations seems better suited than this film. For everyone interested in Marty's films start with Goodfellas or the classic Taxi Driver and move your way up or down as you like, because Scorsese's filmography has a wide range of variety, from gangster flicks to children's movies."

The production is extensive and impressive in scope; featuring numerous detailed sets, countless costumes, and a seemingly infinite number of extras. <br/><br/>It is in fact in Martin Scorsese's direction of Gangs of New York that the film falls from greatness, being amateurish at times even; the cinematography and score are unnoteworthy; the voice-over and flashbacks are expository and stops the film from transcending into narrative and thematic maturity (even with the adult content). <br/><br/>But nevertheless, Gangs of New York is a well-paced, accessible, entertaining and even thrilling historical blockbuster, featuring a wonderfully indulgent production and a glorious and astoundingly good Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill 'The Butcher'."

","Gangs of New York had my eyes glued to the screen as an amazing, stunning, historical piece to Martin Scorcese's filmography, until the final third of the movie where it fell a little flat. The plot twists and smooth storytelling Scorcese is famous for just went into thin air. I don't want to spoil the movie, but after a major scene between Daniel Day-Lewis and Leonardo DiCaprio, the movie gets a little banal and dried up until one of the very last dramatic scenes. The pace and the throbbing heart that kept this movie alive just suddenly fails to keep going. The story slows down, and not much happens for a while.

","It's a crying shame Scorsese didn't wait another ten years to make Gangs of New York, which was subject to money issues and constrictions that kept it from being the fully realized masterpiece that it could have been. Instead, it's a bit rushed, and the necessary violence feels bludgeoning. Some of these characters are rather important thematically to the story, and it takes multiple viewings (a la Godfather) before you can really 'read between the lines' and understand why ""this guy got hammered"" and ""this person hates this person."" The why, essentially, is off the table, because there's no real time for it, and what we're left with is quick and nasty tableau of nightmares, much in the way you'd feel if you woke up from a coma and suddenly found yourself in Egypt post-Mubarak. You have to understand something before you can no longer fear it, and the America we're presented with in this film is dark, dirty, bloody, and all together terrifying, owing more to a post-apocalyptic Mad Max than a genuine American epic. Holding a narrative together is a simple revenge fantasy that pits an Irish-Catholic immigrant's son (and who's to say the boy wasn't born in America- irony of ironies, he's only ten or so in the film's prologue) against a Know-Nothing Nativist (Bill the Butcher, played with stunning ferocity by Daniel Day-Lewis). Bookending this garish chronicle is the off-putting music of Irish-band U2, fittingly picked but somewhat surprisingly allowed to plug in, giving the prologue a rather silly MTV vibe.<br/><br/>Does all this make it a bad movie? Actually, no, I feel it's one of Scorsese's better and worthwhile films (just certainly not his best). There's definitely a personal touch to it and it's historical accuracy is fairly on-the-spot. However, when you have to highlight a load of bloodshed and massacre for 168 minutes in order for the narrative to make sense, you're left with something like Howard Zinn's ""A People's History""... a very cynical look at something that needs room to breathe and angles to examine. You need the why? Unlike Zinn's history, this film isn't meant to outrage and isn't trying to exploit, and you can tell this is the case. But the violence is numbing. Imagine if Scorsese had directed Game of Thrones and stuffed a bunch of George R R Martin books into one 168 minute massacre.... Well, the history here is just as complicated, if not more so. Gang needed a Boardwalk Empire style presentation, it needed to be a series. But I don't blame Scorsese for making it when he did. He had been trying for 20 years to get it made, and Band of Brothers, that great WW2 series that turned epic storytelling on premium channels into something that could be conceivably accomplished, was just out of the starting gate as Gangs went to print.<br/><br/>Erich von Stroheim would've killed to have that kind of unrestricted license. For this piece, Martin Scorsese would've been better served by it."

","Martin Scorsese is known for making great films and couple of gangster movies comes to mind. This isn't like the previous gangster films by Scorsese but it does have certain Scorsese elements that makes it a good watch. I personally didn't find it as gripping or compelling as his previous gangster films although this one does have few gripping moments. But just seem to lack in certain areas. It's still a good watch but for a Scorsese film there is this certain level of expectation for his films, and this one just didn't seem all that amazing. I remember watching this film when it first came out and thought it's a awesome freaking film but seeing it now, I can see how it's lacking in certain areas. The story is about groups of gangsters during the early stages of New York City. During a almost lawless time, it was basically the freaking wild west. It's a story about honor, vengeance, romance, friendship and patriotism. In another words it's one of those tough guy movies with a great story, this one is just underdeveloped in certain areas and might have worked better as a mini series. But the acting by Daniel Day-Lewis and the design of this film makes this one worthy of sitting almost 3 hours through it. The other actors were alright as well. Although Leonardo DiCaprio plays the narrator and the main protagonist and became Scorsese muse after this film. His character is basically this infiltrator in a gang like in one of those Hong Kong undercover cop films. This film is all about Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher though. If there is a racist badass in a movie he would be it. Yeah, I know calling a racist a badass just doesn't go well together at all. But in this Daniel really puts on a memorable performance for his character. That and because Bill the Butcher although a gangster has certain code of honor that he sticks by. I guess even gangsters back than had certain rules and codes they stood by even when they fought in gang wars. Bill is a extreme patriot but a racist never the less but I can see why people would follow a guy like him in that era, despite his detestable and ruthless racist inner self, he is just so darn charismatic and intimidating. Plus there was a lot of racists that actually did some malicious acts during the period this film takes place. Anyways in another words Bill is a very memorable villain, although Bill might see himself as a true patriot and maybe even a hero. This is the role I will know Daniel Day-Lewis for and maybe his role as Abraham Lincoln. Cameron Diaz is alright as the love interest in the story. But reminded me a lot of Cameron's role in ""Feeling Minnesota"", even the direction of her character is similar. Basically about a girl that is unsatisfied with her life so wants to run away to another state while leading some guy on. Overall this is a film that has a good build up but seemed rush near the end and somewhat underdeveloped for this types of stories. And wanted to see a bit more development in certain areas. But this film is still a Scorsese film that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Gangs of New York, is unlike anything I've ever seen. It is a masterpiece of Scorsece. but can be a show of pure entertainment, with excellent performances. It is a film that is half history, half action, half drama, half crime. The story, as the title says, is about the first gang that existed in New York City before and during the American Civil War, which were mostly composed of Irish, Chinese, German, etc ... The main character is Amsterdam Vallon, the son of one of the most powerful leaders of the gangs of New York (the dead-rabbits), who was killed during a clash against another gang, a gang American (The Patriots), he returns to New York years later seeking revenge against Bill the Butcher, the leader of the Patriots who killed his father. Of course you already think he's back, joins the group from his father, there is a confrontation and a nice happy ending ... Well, as I said before, it's all very different from what I've seen. The film goes deeper than the main story itself, explores the city of new york ""before it becomes a city."" The whole movie has as stage, the neighborhood of five points (what is now Paradise Square). Hence the film covers much of the history of the city, New York before and during the civil war was controlled by gangs while politicians were concerned only with the votes of election, with the help some gangs. The gang that controls the five points controlled the entire city (mainly because the five points gave access to all city streets). The story serves as a wick for the fire of the film. The film even manages to be epic at this point, as can also be disturbing in some parts, while fun to watch, no one notices the length of time it will fly. One point that I should mention is the soundtrack that is very diverse, some are even disturbing, others funny, others extremely epic. The soundtrack of the film's ending is a mixture of all that we hear the during movie. The film is very well made and designed, the cast is fantastic, Daniel Day Lewis dominates with one of his best performances, and of course we have Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz as always excellent. An epic film that I found while a good and entertaining history lesson at the same time we had fun and thrill. Congratulations Martin Scorsece!"
"ironhorse_iv","7","0","0","7 March 2013"," You know how this movie survives this long. All these years? Fear. The spectacle of fearsome acts.
","Quotes the best part of the movie: Bill the Butcher Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis). Yes, this movie is famous for its endless amount of violence acts put into film. Honestly I found this to be one of the weaker Martin Scorsesse films, due to the reason that the movie can't find a plot. Inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1928 non-fiction book, The Gangs of New York. The book didn't have no plot to it, so the movie searches for one for it, and can't decide on one. The movie jumps from plot to plot, with many unnecessary scenes. And just when you think we've settled into a plot line for the rest of the movie, bam! Something else come into view. I'll explain it. The movie starts out with two gangs fighting over a New York neighborhood known as the Five Points. One gang is the Natives (those born in the United States) lead by Bill the Butcher. It's kind of funny, that the Irish actor is playing a American while a American is playing a Irish immigrant named Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio). Amsterdam's father Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) leads an Irish gang known as the Dead Rabbits against the Natives. Before Liam Neeson can make an impact in the film, he is quickly kill off. A downer for the film, due to the level of acting he could have gave the film. Instead, we get a very green actor Leonardo DiCaprio playing a young man looking for revenge for the death of his father. Leo has gotten much better as an actor, but here, he was pretty mediocre and looks miscast. This revenge story get stretched for far too long, and was not a satisfying conclusion to the movie due to the other plot lines coming in and taking its ton on the script. In the middle of this revenge story arch, we're also focusing on the Civil War tensions that lead to the Draft Riots, the battles between the Catholic and Protestant groups, with the corrupt politicians like Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) waiting in the shadows. Jim is really great in the role, as he sees people only as votes to help him keep in power. The movie implies that America is corruption, how politicians and rich people are evil, and how the country exploits immigrants. Granted, there are lots of ways to show the underclass rooting against oppression and corruption, but you first have to make it look like the underdogs are worthy of triumph, which this movie didn't do. The people we seeing are just as bad as the politicians. Anyone who's read about New York knows that the street gangs of that day and age were pretty bad. In a city of about 800,000, you had close to 100,000 of them were criminals. It was definitely a colorful and dangerous world about which a cool story could be told. Still, it would be nice to see some redemption morality arch in there. I suspect this movie does not fully represent all the population. There had to be poor immigrants who were desperately trying to live honest lives and had some sense of decency. In general, the characters have few if any redeeming qualities. Instead we have violence for the sake of violence. The killing is drawn out and overemphasized. By the end of the film, you're just glad they are killing themselves off. Nudity and sex is also overdone. Breasts all over the place, triage, women hanging on men over and over again. Too much of everything, except story. The only two positive things I can comment about this movie is that Daniel Day-Lewis put in a wonderful performance as The Butcher. Daniel Day Lewis is the finest actor to ever grace our screens. Completely without parallel! While other actors does characters acting, Daniel Day Lewis does method acting, basically turning himself to the role. You just have to watch Daniel Day Lewis work in two of the best scenes in the movie, ""Poor Rabbit"" and 'Honorable Men' speech. Of course Bill's a man of principle. He is the classic American archetype of a principled man in the mold of a Mark Twain character. A violent street thug, though ethically flawed, consistently loyal to his own principles, not necessarily yours. Still, lots of irritating details that makes you questions. He displays eloquence and vocabulary on par with an English professor yet living in the slum and also have pinpoint accuracy when tossing axes and knifes. I thought that required depth perception. There is a few Historical accuracy, for a film that is set in 1800's New York's ghetto- it gets the MGM musical clean treatment for sets and set dressing. The clothing is clean colorful and you expect at any moment the actors will break into song, the film need to looks appropriate dismal and dirty. I love the scene where New York gradually morph into the city it is today under the song U2, The Hands That Built America. Still, the movie has it fails, but it was still worth watching. It just didn't come anywhere near expectations."

","Gangs of New York is a film that suffers from the typical Hollywood problems. Miscasting for one: Di Caprio and Diaz may have got more people through the gate, but they are completely unbelievable as characters who have suffered hard times and poverty. LDC in particular isn't authentic in the slightest as a vengeful, hand-to-mouth street criminal. There is also the mandatory romance storyline thrown in, that has no purpose other than ticking the box of what a blockbuster film must contain. The much-admired fight scene at the start is just your average mainstream slasher, more about the gore and violence than the characters. The movie is also too long for what it is.<br/><br/>Otherwise, they get some things right. It looks nice enough, evoking 1860s New York in an interesting and believable way. There is the occasional snatch of nice dialogue, or intense scene. Still, you can't shake the feeling that this is far too Hollywood: a story about hardship on the streets, told through a pampered, privileged cast with a mega budget."

","Director Martin Scorsese's deep fascination with the underground gangster lifestyle and complex inter-workings of illegal operations has led him to backtrack when gangs blatantly controlled the streets of what would soon become the most active and functioning city in America. Gangs of New York is a wickedly effective film, dark and crisp in most fields, including scenes that could easily be dubbed heartless and dehumanizing. Despite these traits, it makes for a devilishly entertaining film of epic length.<br/><br/>I have mentioned before that Martin Scorsese is one of my favorite filmmakers and is often, what I consider to be, a treasure taken for granted. When we look at his films, many of see a great story, with superb performances, and a very long runtime. We don't see the intricate aspects that make every one of his films surpass all expectations. My personal favorite of his, Casino from 1995, is one of his longest films, and is exquisitely written and directed, but is also shot with so much care and attention to detail. Shots are vibrant, cinematography and atmosphere are evoked in a limitless state, and every scene is electrifying, right up until the final sequences which some have dubbed ""visually disturbing."" But on with Gangs. It is a wonderful period piece, with more life and enigma that many of its kind. Early scenes show us Lower Manhattan's Five Points in 1846, where the nativists, lead by the notorious and deeply depraved cynic William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting (Lewis), are about to square-off and battle with the Irish gang the ""Dead Rabbits"" run by Priest Vallon (Neeson). The battle erupts after a long, ominous silence occurs as the two groups find each other in the stone-cold street. When it begins, it rarely lets up. It is brutal, bloody, and downright tantalizing as many men are beaten and stabbed, till dozens of lifeless bodies crowd the street. Vallon is murdered, as his young son Amsterdam witnesses the unforgiving assembly of violence. He is shipped off to an orphanage, never to be seen again.<br/><br/>Until sixteen years later, where he among many other Irish immigrants arrive on a boat where they unload into the bitter streets of New York. Amsterdam is played by Leonardo DiCaprio, who drifts about as far away from the pretty-boy image as one could get, after portraying a passionate romantic in James Cameron's classic just five years prior. Amsterdam's goal is to seek out revenge for his father's death, and is willing to go through great lengths to obtain it. It's a dish best served cold, and he wants it with extra ice.<br/><br/>The performances, like in any other Scorsese picture, are intricate, marvelous, and absolutely engaging. While DiCaprio is sure to please the crowd, the standout is none other than Daniel Day-Lewis as the Butcher. The character is quite possibly the most ruthless and soulless villain the year 2002 had ever seen, and what could've morphed into a one-dimensional, ridiculous antagonist, comes off and bleeds complexity and evil. Pure, unadulterated, fearful evil.<br/><br/>A plethora of secondary characters keep the film going as well. Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly have wonderful roles, and Jim Broadbent gets some much-deserved screen time as the corrupt and desperate Boss Tweed, who will go to any length to receive votes in the forthcoming election. Like in any Scorsese film, there is a love story with the main character, this time involving the crafty con-woman Jenny, played by Cameron Diaz. While Diaz is fun to watch and is possibly doing some of her best work, she always seems to be one-upped by Day-Lewis' and DiCaprio's respective characters.<br/><br/>Some have written off Gangs as Scorsese's ""messy masterpiece,"" when it really is an interestingly made epic providing commentary on America's explicit xenophobia at the time. It's 2012, and in a time where the immigration issue immediately turns heads, this film provides the brutally honest retelling of the nativists' reception without being too hokey, biased, or heavy-handed. The film holds off on coating the story with sugar and sweetness because we have been told the soft-side of history for far too long.<br/><br/>And that's why I like the film so much; it's daring and honest. It has a heavy layer of cynicism, that some may find too smothering and too mean-spirited. We can't always be told the mild side of things, when there is a much greater lesson to be taught. Cynicism and pessimism are part of life, and as soon as we can realize that, the sooner we will be far more educated about the world around us.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York tells a story that hasn't been brought up too often, and its result is definitely commendable. Consistent readers will take note that this is the first film by Scorsese that I have not awarded a perfect rating. One of the greatest emotions a film can bring to a person is the feeling of sadness and depression, and I have walked away with that feeling in all of Scorsese's previous pictures, with the notable exception of Hugo. When Gangs ends, it feels like it has ended, and we are just left contemplating the great change New York has endured since 1862. Not much else. Regardless, this is a beautifully made film with enriching cinematography, beyond capable performances from actors of all different statuses, and refuses to sugarcoat history although it is in a great position to do so.<br/><br/>Starring: Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Brendan Gleeson, John C. Reilly, and Liam Neeson. Directed by: Martin Scorsese."
"Steffi_P","9","0","0","1 April 2012"," ""Criminal's braggadocio""
","Over the years, Martin Scorsese has established himself as the cinematic biographer of New York City. In Gangs of New York, he recounts one of its lesser-known but intensely fascinating chapters, in what was a long-cherished project. Like The Last Temptation of Christ, a similarly personal picture, it seems a perfect vehicle for his ostentatious directorial style.<br/><br/>The inspiration for this movie was a non-fiction book of the same title and screenwriters Jay Cocks, Steve Zaillian and Kenneth Lonergan have woven a decent action story around a few kernels of historical truth and half-truth. The documentary-like detail is there, although it's more about period background than recreating events, as the main plot is largely fiction. Within this plot certain themes are writ large - the honour of one-on-one combat, the idea of revenge as something almost sacred, the hero's coming of age and so forth. There's also lots of rather obvious religious symbolism both in the script and Scorsese's imagery – the bible in the water, the rosary beads tossed aside, crucifixes popping up all over. There's even a bit of a Christ allegory going on with Amsterdam's betrayal by the Judas-like Johnny and his subsequent resurrection. It's clichéd, to be sure, but it's rather good fun too.<br/><br/>And Scorsese's portrayal of old New York is as surreal and baroque as it is factual. No doubt this was a strange time and place to be around in, but Scorsese whoops it up to almost operatic proportions. Take for example, in the opening scenes, the various gangs' campy self-introductions, or Daniel Day-Lewis's top hat disappearing off the top of the screen like it goes on into infinity. To be honest, it's all a far better match for Scorsese's zooming, swooping camera-work than his straighter dramas were. Scorsese also gets big plus points for doing almost all of it with real people and real sets without resorting to CGI. The movie looks far richer and livelier for it.<br/><br/>This was the director's first outing with his new fave lead man Leonardo DiCaprio. DiCaprio is not exceptional here – it's simply another good-looking hero role that doesn't tax him much. The part that commands most attention is that of Daniel Day-Lewis. His ability to disappear into a role so different from his real background and persona is commendable, though at times his Bill Cutting comes across as a hammy impression of Robert De Niro. But such theatricality is all very much part and parcel of Gangs of New York. Many of the smaller parts are in a similarly extravagant vein; most worthy of mention are Gary Lewis and Jim Broadbent.<br/><br/>Stylised as it is, the movie couldn't really afford to be too esoteric, and there are a fair few concessions to commercialism. Some moments have a modern action gloss, typified by the ""schwoomp"" noise when we zoom in on Day-Lewis's glass eye. Then there's the fact that, even though the script says DiCaprio will ""walk among you as a freak"" his scarring only amounts to a faint white blotch; actually marring his pretty-boy features presumably not being viable. But these are minor quibbles. From its haunting introduction to its apocalyptic finale, Gangs of New York makes a mighty yarn."

","the sets, the costumes, the settings. This is a beautiful movie to look at. You feel like you really have dropped in to the middle of an 1800s slum in New York. And boy is it ever gritty. this is the birth pains of America in all its gory. And yes, that is not a typo. This is a brutally violent movie. There are no real heroes above reproach. It's an ugly tale of greed, hatred, bigotry, racism, debauchery, pride, humiliation, and there's no final scene with a redemption.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis mesmerizes with his performance. He IS Bill the Butcher. You totally forget he could be anyone else. His Bill is pompous, self-righteous, vile, and yet carries with him a sense of honor, although his definition is definitely twisted.<br/><br/>DiCaprio has a harder time making us forget he is a Hollywood A-list actor. But he tries and he does well at times. But once in a while, the camera can't help but showcase his pretty-boy good looks. Even when his hair is greasy and dirty it still looks like a matinée idol ""perfect"" kind of dirty. Telling is the scene where he is supposedly scarred for life on the cheek with a red hot knife blade. Yet five minutes later you see his face, almost untouched, as if he was just filming a Dove Soap commercial.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz has a strange un-placeable accent. But she tries and does OK as the street pickpocket. Unfortunately the 'romance' between her and DiCaprio seems very forced and misplaced in this tale. It probably could have done without that at all. Sure, let them sleep together but there should be no love romance about it. This awkward romance is the weakest link in the whole film and probably the source of the poor reviews of Diaz's acting. It's not really her fault. It's the story.<br/><br/>The story isn't overly complicated. No twists nor turns. You watch because you know what's going to happen, but you want to see how it happens and what the outcomes affect on the main characters will be.<br/><br/>Overall, 7/10."

","First off I would like to say that it is hard to find a bigger Scorsese and Day-Lewis fan than myself and I am becoming quite a big fan of DiCaprio so I was already supper excited before the DVD was even being put in the DVD Player. What I saw over the three hours that followed was one of those rare times when a movie lives up to all your hopes and dreams.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis as Bill ""the Butcher"" is easily one of my all time favorite movie characters and no one could have pulled it off like Daniel. DiCaprio, as Amsterdam, really showed off his flourishing talent which was mixed with his earlier youthful style seen in Titanic and The Quick and the Dead and his now darker and more dramatic style which you can see in movies like Shutter Island and Revolutionary Road. Also Cameron Diaz surprised me as I usually find her acting wanting, defiantly not good enough to pull off a role in such a deep movie.<br/><br/>As for the story, I can not even began to explain how amazing and insightful it was into how life was like in the 1840s in New York. Now yes this movie is long but if you are like me, length means nothing and never effects my view of a movie.<br/><br/>All around, just an outstanding movie."
"jzappa","8","0","0","25 October 2011"," Personal Vs. Political
","Though Scorsese had cogitated this project for decades, it still serves well as a companion piece to his adaptation of The Age of Innocence. Set in 1870s NYC, that story depicts the ivory tower built upon the urchins of the city's mean streets up into the 1860s, depicted here. I find the extreme class divides between both stories fascinating. Was Day-Lewis' Newland Archer studying law and enjoying the opera on the Upper East Side at the same time his Bill the Butcher was leading slaughters in Lower Manhattan? Standing alone, nonetheless, Gangs is about the classic revenge struggle of DiCaprio's angry young hero Amsterdam.<br/><br/>This is Amsterdam's fever dream of recollections and impressions of the history of Five Points. Mention of saints, Satan cast out of paradise and a large, championed crucifix, all in a row not even two minutes in, shortly followed by a battalion of reactionaries receiving Holy Communion before a vicious street fight, signals Scorsese's way through the character's agitated story, some of it, Amsterdam tells us, he remembers, the rest of which he took from dreams. So, he's very much of his time, place and circumstances, living them both inside and out. This gives Gangs the vehement storytelling energy of Scorsese's more modern films centered on gangsters, rather than, say, the abstract contemplativeness of his earlier Kundun, also about a crusader whose early childhood is saturated in deep religious zeal. And perhaps there's a religious lapse personal to Scorsese when Amsterdam becomes a man, setting forth on his vendetta as he pitches the Bible into the river, in very smooth high-definition slow-motion.<br/><br/>What's also immediately evident is the full-bodied cacophony of urban life, squashed in on itself, doing little to comfort traditionalists and xenophobes, not the least stubborn of which is Day-Lewis' Irish-hating Bill, a killer WASP let's say, introduced scraping his foot against the ground like a literal bull, whom we later learn is perhaps the most eloquent man ever to have trouble reading. NYC here is its own character, arguably in a similar way that Vietnam is the main character of Apocalypse Now, in that it ceaselessly inundates the characters on their epic journey. Amsterdam and Bill are at personal odds framed by their dynamically different class and generational positions in a society fueled by racism and other forms of bigotry, fed by ubiquitous corruption. The illustration of the hounding and intolerance of non-Natives at the time is one of the historical elements to which the film remains most faithful. Even beyond the barbaric makeshift melees that bookend this saga, violence is the fabric of this main character, and Scorsese creates an all-encompassing textile of sudden explosions of it, from fleeting cutaways of random muggings to a brutal fistfight between Amsterdam and McGloin carefully storyboarded for gracefully headlong, vicious energy, followed with fluent transition into a contemplative comedown of Amsterdam's uncertain sentiment toward the newly admiring Butcher.<br/><br/>True to America's lineage, Scorsese depicts a world where property holds sway over humanity. ""I'll give you a dollar for that locket,"" Bill bids a fellow, who tells him it was his mother's. ""Dollar and a half,"" Bill wrangles. ""Done."" A man of wealth, likely one of Newland Archer's peers, bids, ""You can always hire half the poor to kill the other half."" Anybody can be bought, and in order to secure your rights and have them protected you must secure and protect them all by yourself. The film's tapestry shows how free-for-all capitalism and weak government had made criminals out of everyone, having generated America's immense gangland history. Let's point out that Amsterdam and his compadres rob a poor woman's house while it's burning down. They're hungry! He later leads his posse in pawning a dead body off as loot. Bill swiftly lets him know that the mere pleasure of his company has a price. We see he means it when he puts on the most masterfully commanding charm and deferential charisma when confronted with a wealthy family whose interests are carefully considered by powers that be.<br/><br/>The film's sporadic glimpse into the antiquated tradecraft of thieves and gangland M.O. is given the grinning sense of nifty fun of The Great Train Robbery's Victorian-era safecracking or Paper Moon's Dustbowl short cons. Cameron Diaz shows her bones as the wickedly clever sneak thief who becomes Vicky to Amsterdam's LaMotta, or maybe more akin to Zoe Bethune to Amsterdam's J.R. Unfortunately, this romantic trajectory also sends the plot for a time into hackneyed territory, something Scorsese had avoided more effectively than any other Hollywood director of his generation, or most. Gangs, thus, does lose the infectious forcefulness and unceasing originality of any of his other crime-themed films. Karen Hill had three dimensions. Diaz's Jenny is increasingly diluted into one, merely a tag-along love interest. It's the class struggle that gets the propellers spinning again, as the immigrants engage their oppressors with Democratic leadership. And when subjugation and violence again overtake, the film comes full circle to the epic street fight for justice, both for the hero and for America itself."

","Gangs of New York is a very fine example of style over substance, with a bit of acting that just hauls it into the 'good' ratings. <br/><br/>The initial plot is one of interest. A war between supposed 'natives' and 'Irish immigrants' in the middle of Five Points in 1800's New York was a very good idea that handled correctly could have made a real statement. And this film certainly had the cast to do it with - Daniel Day Lewis as the leader of the natives, and Liam Neeson as the leader of the Irish immigrant. The problem is that rather than focus on the war, it chooses to then focus on a somewhat clichéd revenge story. Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis) kills the Priest (Neeson), and the Priest's son then comes back to kill Bill. <br/><br/>And here's the first problem that shows the story is wrong - A Priest can't have children if they've been ordained before marriage etc. That's actually quite a slip from the film-makers and immediately the film loses a sense of realism. <br/><br/>It then goes on to try and tell too many other stories. To add to the Five Points war, you then have the Civil War, a love story that doesn't seem to make sense and corrupt politics. Scorsese tries to make the film an epic, but doesn't explore it enough and leaves a few too many lose ends. <br/><br/>However, there are many plus points in this film that make it entirely watchable and entertaining. First of all, Scorsese's direction is very, very good. He directs some slick action scenes, some brutal fight scenes and the overall look of the film is outstanding. The set is exceptional, and clearly was researched properly even if other elements of the film weren't. <br/><br/>Also, generally the characters are defined enough that you know their motives, and were the cast exceptionally well so there is at least realism in the acting. Liam Neeson as the Priest at the beginning is a solid role. Brendan Gleeson as ""Monk"" is good, and even Leo DiCaprio is competent enough. But this film really is about the acting between Daniel Day Lewis as Bill Butcher and Jim Broadbent as 'Boss' Tweed, the corrupt politician. They are both outstanding. <br/><br/>Overall, this is a well acted, stylishly directed film. It's good to look at and there's enough plot development that it is entertaining. But I do feel that if they'd not bothered with the revenge plot and had instead focused on the political story, they'd have had a far better film."

","The plot: Tight enough and well paced, with a couple of lows (expected for a three-hour film) but generally it comes out pretty neat. Some may find it disturbing, as it contains extreme violence and it does not portray an America of happy workers, even happier slaves, benevolent rich and just authorities - instead, it portraits the true 1860 society. Definitely not for those who like their films with plenty of sugar on the top.<br/><br/>The epic and the drama: Well, basically the film is the story of two men. Around them things evolve and a brave new world comes forth - but we only get to watch snapshots of that world. Until the last sequence, that is when the whole city ""explodes"" (in some occasions literally...) and the streets are being covered in blood, and the two aspects (the main story and the events of the era) are being tied together in the same continuum.<br/><br/>At the same time, the director attempts to portrait the whole birth and growth of the United States, in a kind of parabole, but without loosing his focus on the main story and the surrounding. Scorsese dives deeply into the psychology of his heroes, without giving out any explanation of their acts other than the probable - he lets us figure it out ourselves, and that's a God-given gift.<br/><br/>The visuals: The film is disturbing, as it contains extreme violence. There are literally streams of blood, hacking, slashing, crushing - even some action movie fans (hey dude, look, he smashed his head with that thing... cool, man!"") might find some parts of the film interesting. The last sequence is visually astounding, and it's by it's own account a reason to watch this film over and over again... if you got the stomach to actually cope with the disturbing images, that is.<br/><br/>The actors: I didn't think it would come a day when I'd say that Leo Di Caprio can act, but ...here I go: The kid can act. And quite good too. Guess he needed a Scorsese to put him in the right path. Same with Cameron Diaz - she has got some potential, seems so. Too bad she wastes it in films like ""the sweetest thing"" and other throw-ups like that. And... Daniel Day Lewis. Truly, with this performance, they should give him the Academy award. He portrays the vile ""Butcher"" in a way few would be able of, and he adds depth to a character that could very easily end up ""two-dimensional"". He is stunningly good.<br/><br/>New York, New York: Scorsese gets involved in something that compares to his previous work the way a fancy little sports car compares to a huge truck: A grandioso film of epic proportions and of great ambition. He does deliver, I believe. But this film shall not be acknowledged universally, because there is too much violence, corruption, lack of the good old white vs black (good vs evil, I mean) concept and does not sweeten the pill in any way. It's disturbing and raw, and it's a great. It's not a political film - in such, the director usually picks a stance, a ""true"" hero, an opposing view, and builds upon those. In this case, the director is truly endistancemented and keeps that distance, even from his ""hero"". There are no ""good"" people in that movie, all are acting like chess pieces in a predetermined way, but at the same time they try to burst out and do their own."

It's high on entertainment, compelling, gratuitously violent but never disappoints you during the two hours and forty five duration. <br/><br/>The Draft Riots was an endless feud that occurred at the time when corrupt political activists of the Tammany Hall took over the crime laden city, and the epic battles by Irish gangs in the Manhattan area that sets off the infamous draft riots. A young man known Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) befriends a sneaky pickpocket (Cameron Diaz) to get even the crazed Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) who assassinated his father. The story was enthralling and the pacing was very subtle.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis really lit the screen as the leading antagonist and was just natural in his performance as Bill the Butcher. And even though I'm not one of DiCaprio's biggest fans, but I have to pay the devil his dues, it is definitely one of his finest outings from him where at the times he was trying out for more older, mature roles. Though not ready for an Oscar, DiCaprio was really convincing as Amsterdam. Cameron Diaz was also wonderful in her smaller role. <br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese takes another angle of the New York's underworld, but adding another direction to it. This time we are sent back to the 19th century where street gangs came in fruition. His message is delivered to us flawlessly.

The setting juxtaposes itself between factual and fictional depiction of events as well as the use of clapboard building and very tall hats, which has intentions for some over-the-top reminder of what's taking place in this dreadful period in New York history. <br/><br/>It's stunning to think that this movie garnered 10 Oscar nominations but ended up getting zilch. It truly is a very underrated movie. And even through all the chastising from the critics, I think this movie is one of the best movies of 2002."
"ElMaruecan82","8","0","0","9 February 2011"," Marty's ferocious retelling of America's history with New York as a microcosm ...
","American movies set during the late 19th century had a strange habit to feature cowboys, pioneers, Indians and sometimes Southern landlords, slaves, Union soldiers etc. Cinematically speaking, it was quite hard to figure how the Yankees were, how New York was like when the South and the West were being won. Maybe that's why Martin Scorsese, one of the greatest New Yorkers, repaired this injustice with ""Gangs of New York"": a ferocious epic of blood, terror and anarchy, with New York as you've never seen it before.<br/><br/>To say that New York's history didn't start until the 20th century is an understatement. However, the film leaves you with the feeling that New York was born after a bloody climactic massacre as painful as the delivery of a new city freed from anarchy, hate and intolerance after the mother died and all the pain with her. New York is depicted as a metaphor of America, with the gang battles as a Secession War on the streets, a War whose consequences could have been lethal, just as if the South had won. This is not a revision of history, but a retelling through the eyes of a New Yorker.<br/><br/>In fact, the title is misleading, when we think of gangs and Scorsese (and New York), a gallery of unforgettable characters comes to mind, Charlie and Johnny Boy, Henry Hill, Jimmy Conway, Tommy De Vito etc. But in Marty's epic, the gangs are fighting for survival, they're robbers, thieves, whores, killers, like Travis Bickle's universe, one century earlier, with the Irish emigrants living like ants in a colony, in the never ending shelves of a hostile and disdaining city. How ironic that they are treated like foreigners and invaders by descendants of emigrants, calling themselves Natives. Indeed, New York's story is depicted with a poetic savagery, like the history of America in microcosm.<br/><br/>Violence in this film, reaches such a level of gore and bestiality, we feel nostalgic thinking of good old guns. In fact, violence would inspire a whole thesis that couldn't fill this review, let's just say that people shout, cry, hit, pull knives in bellies, stomachs, legs  it's a snow reddening violence not for money or greed, but for survival. These are the primal instincts in the veins of the hands that built America, hands closed to become a fist, before they could shake other hands. And who else could have been the leader of these people, who else could have incarnated such bestial savagery but a villain named Bill the Butcher, played by an amazing Daniel Day-Lewis?<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is the soul of this film, a charismatic villain profoundly attached to the Five Points, his territory. This sacred link was sealed after the spectacular victory against the Dead Rabbits, the Irish gang whose leader, 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) was killed by Bill's bare hands in front of his son, Amsterdam. 16 years later after, fate puts Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Caprio) in Bill's path. He becomes his protégé, inspiring Bill's fatherly instinct. Of course, the Shakespearian aspect of the story can't avoid some stereotypical un-Scorsesian situations, the revenge story, and the romance with Jenny (Cameron Diaz) the pick pocket expert, which I have always thought to be too pretty for that role, and Amsterdam not the most colorful character of the film (nothing against Leo's performance, but Daniel Day-Lewis puts so much charisma and energy in his role, he'd make anyone look dull)<br/><br/>Fortunately, these details don't hurt the film; the writing is sometimes so good it elevates the traditional Scorsesian dilemma to epic proportions. Amsterdam might not be Bickle, Archer, LaMotta, but we feel for him. To accomplish his duty, to avenge his father, he needed Bill's trust and sympathy, even if the price was to kill and to be betrayed by his own blood. But the intelligence of the script, an element not to be underestimated, is that it makes you realize that this guilt is driven by the same racialist instinct that ignited the hate. Therefore, Amsterdam won't redeem his soul by killing Bill the Butcher but by ending his dictatorship, and killing the evil spirit about to poison the whole dream of New York City, freedom and brotherhood, America's epitome.<br/><br/>That's how the story transcends Amsterdam's dilemma, it's not just the Irish, there are Black, Chinese, people from lower classes, every layer of what'll build tomorrow's society, who'll fight for their right to live and to be respected in this country, it's like a Civil War in one town, a war leading to one of the most spectacular climactic battle sequences in a movie, where basically, everyone fights, men, women, rich, poor, police, fire fighters etc. Violence is so bloodily chaotic it's like America finally exorcising all the demons in the most violent way, which in Scorsese's vision means the most redeeming. How ironic that people who didn't want to go to War took part in another war anyway. And the municipal resources deployed to end the massacre were so important it spared no one and created a posthumous union, symbolized by the last confrontation between Bill and Amsterdam. Bill dies a true American, unaware that his death gave birth to a new real American spirit.<br/><br/>Bill's death was Amsterdam's redemption. But the central character of this film is not Amsterdam, or Bill or any member of any gang, the central character is New York, as the town of all the ideals, hopes and fears America represented. The town sinned through disunion and was redeemed by blood. You don't make up for your sins in church you do it in the streets ... No wonder this is the town that most symbolizes America, and that only Marty could have made such a powerful film."

","This is one of those movies that is very deep, has a lot going on at the same time, and demands your full attention. But one thing that it also requires is a historical knowledge of this time period. Without that knowledge, the movie isn't worth much to the viewer. You may also find yourself lost and even wondering why anyone likes this film.<br/><br/>I will start off this review with the positive aspects of the film. <br/><br/>1. The acting. Daniel-Day Lewis put together his best performance since ""My Left Foot"". He plays the antagonist and does a superb job of making you loathe him. The greasy hair, the ridiculous outfits, the smug look on his face, that arrogant walk, and even his manner of speaking makes him repulsive. His image alone makes you want to curl up your fist and smash his face in. He is truly the ultimate villain. Even many of the smaller roles are played quite well. The actor selection for this movie is amazing, save the selection of Cameron Diaz. Don't get me wrong, Diaz surprisingly performed her part well. But with Scorsese, you'd expect a better selection of actress. Nonetheless, she easily put in her best performance ever.<br/><br/>2. This film does a fine job depicting this specific time period in New York. The story is important and is actually quite relevant today. Based on the description of this movie on the back cover of the DVD, I figured this movie was just about the Irish. But it's not. It is also about civil rights, the poor, the corrupt, and is a testimony to the history of New York. This is a story that needed to be told and it was put together quite well. The set designer deserves credit for putting together an excellent representation of a Civil War era New York.<br/><br/>Here are the problems with this film:<br/><br/>1. It is still rather bland and lengthy. The movie is more informative than entertaining. While the movie definitely has tense moments, irony, foreshadowing, and amazing acting it still doesn't have much of a climax. The climax also quickly fizzles. <br/><br/>2. The movie has so much going on that it becomes quite confusing. I commend the director for using visual aids such as flashbacks to try to clarify the film. But it is still hard to follow. With so many events going on and so many different groups fighting, it's hard to keep track of the whole point of the film. At the end of the movie plenty of people will be left wondering what just happened and what purpose this film holds. <br/><br/>This movie is still worth watching. But like I stated earlier, please do a little research before watching this movie. Do a quick study on the Five Points, the Civil War, and immigration during the Civil War era. You will appreciate the film much more if you know what is going on."
"bobsgrock","Null","0","0","14 January 2011"," The rich, violent, turbulent history of America.
","Despite some of its flaws, few films are as relevant to these times as Martin Scorsese's historical epic of the birth of modern America, Gangs of New York. At a time when politicians are attempting to reform the immigration policy, this look at a time when all races and groups had some form of antagonism against all other races and groups is very much a testament to the roots of our making this country great.<br/><br/>In looking at this film, there is little doubt that this is one of Scorsese's best and most brilliantly told films from a technical and visual standpoint. Never before, and perhaps never again, has a director put forth such great effort to preserve as much as possible about the details and minute elements that made up life in New York circa 1863. The sets are astonishingly realistic, the costumes first-rate, the extras well-placed and effective. If nothing else, Scorsese has crafted here perhaps the most exquisitely beautiful and bold portrait of American life in the 19th century.<br/><br/>Yet, other elements work just as well. The acting is very fine with Leonardo DiCaprio giving a rousing performance as Amsterdam, son of a slain gang leader returning to avenge his father's death. His nemesis is Bill the Butcher, played with delightful evil by the great Daniel Day-Lewis, a method actor with more than enough determination and diligence to completely embody his character. He is the most flashy and noticeable performer, overshadowing nearly everyone but all credential he received were well-deserved. However, perhaps Cameron Diaz is a bit miscast here, too pretty-faced and valley girl to rightly portray a pickpocketing, street-tough woman.<br/><br/>In all, Scorsese has put together some of the finest technical work he has ever done, his camera never more fluid or bold, the editing crisp and smooth, the cinematography wide and fresh. Yet, at the screenplay level some serious flaws remain, notably at the conclusion. Without giving anything away, one comes away feeling as if the ending was anti-climactic, and the way Scorsese built it all up makes it feel like a real cheat. At times, the story does lag a bit, focusing on characters and subplots not necessary to the main focus on Amsterdam and Bill. Still, in spite of these shortcomings, this is one of Scorsese's more underrated works. It dazzles the eyes and speaks to the heart. This is our history as Americans. The idea is to learn from it so as not to repeat it. That is the message for today, tomorrow and future generations to come."
"valadas","6","0","0","5 December 2010"," Epic but mostly gratuitous
","The movie begins with a fierce street battle between two gangs fighting for the control of a degraded New York neighbourhood: the so-called Native Americans and a group of Irish immigrants. The former win the battle and that control for the years to come. This is supposed to have taken place in mid-nineteenth century. This battle is very well filmed, directed and acted. The usual Scorsese's mastery revealing itself once more. From then on we watch the return of the young son (Di Caprio) of the immigrant leader who was killed by the Native Americans' leader during the battle. He comes out of an orphanage with the intention of revenging his father's death. The movie goes on through scenes of great realism where we see in the streets of those New York poor quarters the proliferation of a mixture of races and nationalities where the most varied gangs dominate: petty gangs, poor gangs, rich gangs, second rate gangs, big and powerful gangsters and poor thieves and robbers. But on the top of the hierarchy there is the great chief the so-called ""The Butcher"" who is precisely who has killed our boy's father in the most cruel way. Till the scene of the first attempt the boy makes to kill The Butcher the movie develops itself in an atmosphere of realistic authenticity.But from then on what we watch is a series of several scenes of doubtful verisimilitude and gratuitous and meaningless violence which seem to serve only the purpose of revealing the savage and cruel nature of The Butcher. He becomes so truculent and brutal and acting with black humour into the bargain, that he turns out to be almost implausible. From a certain point on the renewed fight between the Native Americans and the Irish immigrants gets mixed in some confused way with the fight of the army conscripts (the Civil War is going on by that time) against their forced enrollment (this fact is historically true and confirmed by the way). Therefore the main value of this movie is only found in its excellent first part since in the second one it loses force in terms of ideas and verisimilitude. It ends in a somewhat clumsy and not very meaningful way in what regards the historical outcome of the fight of those two groups (if it ever actually happened any time)."
"Eternality","9","0","0","27 October 2010"," The ever so reliable Scorsese can be counted upon to paint a stunning picture of one of America's most turbulent periods.
","Martin Scorsese's Gangs Of New York (nominated for an amazing ten Oscars but failed to win even one) is a measured accomplishment. If Gangs Of New York were helmed by another director, even the harshest critic would have labeled it the year's best film. Because of our sky-high expectations for a Scorsese picture, whatever he does surely comes under some scrutiny. Many claim that Gangs is too commercialized, and is devoid of the usual Scorsese magic. Others complain that it's a slow, and dully-written film.<br/><br/>While this is not Scorsese's best effort (neither is it close to what he has achieved in his prime), Gangs Of New York is still a very powerful period film. It's a slightly fictionalized account about the development of America in the mid-19th century. The opening sequence (one of the my favourites!) is an incredible experience, almost spiritual-like. After that, it seems quiet by comparison. Scorsese takes his time to develop the characters, with Daniel Day-Lewis providing the star performance as Bill The Butcher.<br/><br/>The elaborate sets, and costumes are striking. The artistic direction is also brilliant here; certain scenes have a respectable level of aesthetics to them. Gangs Of New York is Scorsese's first attempt to make a film on the epic scale. He succeeds to a favourable extent. But the film occasionally meanders about, huffing and puffing along. There's still much to appreciate though, and the ever so reliable Scorsese can be counted upon to paint a stunning picture of one of America's most turbulent periods.<br/><br/>SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"

","While I praise Leo for his work, it's hard not to admit that Daniel Day owns every inch of the screen. So much so, that every scene he's not in only eats on your anticipation to get to his next appearance. It's a perfect set of talent and chemistry. Putting Leo together with Daniel and Martin Scorsese is a dream team. I'm falling off course here but it's a wonder that up to this point, Scorsese hadn't yet earned an Oscar for his work. This film had ten nominations and no wins. I find that to be a catastrophe. It's a work of art.<br/><br/>Daniel Day is one of the most dynamic and magnetizing actor.s of all time. I say this because, when watching De Niro, Nicholson, Pacino, and maybe even Brando, aside for his work in The Godfather and maybe even Apocalypse Now, you're watching these actors take on the characters. But you always know that you are watching these actors, there's no mistaking it. Yet, Daniel Day is the type of actor that blends so well into character that you don't even know who the actor is until they role credits. He is different in every role as is the the under appreciated Gary Oldman."
"Samiam3","Null","0","0","28 June 2010"," Powerful yet poorly told, (may grow on you with multiple viewings)
","One thing that can be said about Marty Scorsese, the man looks nothing like his movies; Five and a half feet, chirpy voice, dorky glasses, but he makes BIG dramas (though not all of them are good). <br/><br/>Gangs of New York is a macho 19th century American epic, well designed and packs a heck of a brutal punch, but it comes with a story that is clunky, ponderous, and not very involving. Scorsese invests too much in style and not enough in substance, some of his famous tracking shots go on way too long, Leo Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz are pretty faces, but they don't have much to say or do. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is epic and memorable, but unlike There Will Be Blood (yet to come) it doesn't save the movie. In the end, Gangs of New York is kind of boring.<br/><br/>This is how I felt the first time I saw the movie. It grew on me a little the second time when I was a bit older, and able to appreciate just how demanding a film this is. I still have a few complaints, but I won't argue that Gangs of New York is a bad film. Cinema goers, will probably see plenty of value in it, but the Marty Scorsese who brought us Raging Bull and Goodfellas is not the same guy behind this one."
"lewiskendell","7","0","0","24 June 2010"," A solid (yet flawed) movie.
","The last act of Gangs of New York made the entire movie worthwhile, for me. It also was part of the reason why the film occasionally felt so disjointed.<br/><br/>On one hand, Gangs of New York tackled such heady issues as immigration, the draft, class conflict, racism, and discrimination of all kinds. It's a pretty brutal and realistic movie, in that regard. On the other hand, it's the story of a young Irish American who seeks revenge for the murder of his father. I found the latter far less interesting than the former. <br/><br/>These two parts of the story are supposed to parallel each other, and I can see the ways that Scorsese tried to connect them, but it's only towards the end where this approach actually works. The rest of the time, it's fairly awkward.  <br/><br/>I lay a lot of the fault for this in the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. I have no problems with either of these actors (and have enjoyed them both in other movies), but they just didn't ""fit"" here. And when they were surrounded by so many actors who were perfect for the location and time period, they stuck out like a sore thumb. It doesn't help that the two characters were basically thrown together, with little story basis for why they should be so devoted to one another.<br/><br/>Despite what I considered to be its considerable flaws, I still thought that Gangs of New York was a good film. Seeing an exaggerated portrayal of some of the actual history of early New York and immigration to the city was cool, and most of the latter half was brilliant. Fans of Scorsese are in for a (at times muddled) treat."

","This movie is definitely well done. The acting is great, the script is good, the scenery amazing, the music perfect. But I have to admit, that I did not like the depressive ending. Martin Scorcese is a master in creating a disturbing atmosphere, as he proofed in ""Cape Fear"" and ""Shutter Island"". Especially the last twenty minutes of this movie, he shoveled so much anger and violence (the riots in the streets) in my face, that I thought about leaving the cinema. The end of the story is realistic, but depressive and if there is a moral to this story, than it is not a nice one. As others already mentioned: Daniel Day-Lewis was great, great, great. He created a believable character with all his ups and downs. Full of love, full of anger, full of pride, full of blackness. He had not a single weak moment. He was there every moment and I can not understand, that he did not win the Oscar for this performance. I am not a fan of Di Caprio and I can not understand, what Scorcese likes about him, but this time he was quiet good. But I am convinced, that others actors would have done a better job. Liam Neeson again just a small role, but far better than his last acting in ""Clash of the titans"". I hated the character of the mayor, so he must have been played good. To me, the role of Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) was not necessary for this movie. It would have worked without her. <br/><br/>Again, very well done movie with great acting. With another ending it would have been a 10."
"Cristi_Ciopron","8","0","0","8 April 2009"," Exciting epic
","As I slowly drift towards U2, I eagerly took in the GANGS OF NEW YORK's score in large doses.<br/><br/>GANGS OF NEW YORK is an exciting and interesting epic, violent melodrama, scary sleazy sensationalism, with some great Robert De Niro impersonation by Day—Lewis. I have to state from the beginning that I enjoyed it very much—perhaps enormously, and the impression was certainly positive. GANGS OF NEW YORK has qualities, it's lively, dynamic, engrossing, thrilling. Were it not a Scorsese movie, I would probably complain everywhere about an unjustly neglected masterpiece, etc.. Day—Lewis' Dickensian impersonation of De Niro is striking and memorable. DiCaprio is perhaps a bit unconvincing, but then again I never perceived this lad's charm. Below I begin listing the movie's defects; keep though in mind that it's a recommended movie. As a piece of strong and shocking sensationalism, it proves mind—blowing. I did not like Day—Lewis in any other role; but as Bill Cutting he is a standout. I know a few Scorsese outings; GANGS OF NEW YORK certainly ranks as the best of them. In terms of mindlessness and pointlessness it reminds the other Scorsese hits. And in other words, it's exciting trash. Fundamentally, it is slapdash; in terms of actual execution, it's often well—done and sensational.<br/><br/>Historically this is very sloppy and inaccurate and misleading movie:--in 1846 the great prayer to S Michael the Archangel was not yet written, nor was communion received into hand as shown in GANGS OF NEW YORK. Now if all their documentation was as pertinent as this samples .<br/><br/>(The ex—seminarian, or almost—seminarian, or whatever Scorsese seems quite ignorant in this direction. This says a lot about this MTV _evangelizer. It was obvious hat this Semidoct philistine sucks. So, I say—always trust a hint, a feel. Scorsese looks foreign to the religion—and he massively is. The slightly instructed Catholics should know that the prayer to S Michael was Pope Leo the 13th initiative and desire. And in the 1840s none in New York received communion in the hand. If such details are mistaken, what can one believe about the details of the hellish city life?) I know daddy Ebert has the cult of the nullity (Altman, Scorsese ), yet it remains ultimately puzzling the degree of esteem that this sloppy hack, Scorsese, got. Teachout noticed somewhere the anomaly of Eastwood's having the reputation of an auteur; true, and the same goes for chaps like Scorsese, Altman, W. Allen . Or for Day—Lewis having the reputation of a great actor. (One day, finding out that Rourke too dislikes Day—Lewis I felt confirmed and vindicated.) since we are at this, let me notice, much to Scorsese's credit, that Altman, for example, never achieved something as good as GANGS OF NEW YORK. I'm completely immune to Altman's searched and constipated charm.<br/><br/>A piece of overblown sensationalism. Notwithstanding, I will not be a hypocrite and I will admit plainly that I enjoyed the movie, I liked it very much, I was positively impressed by it.<br/><br/>I guess I already have another two comments about Scorsese movies; this one is the least negative of them, the least spiteful and offensive. What can I say? If you are a Scorsese sympathizer, do not take it too hard; perhaps we share another ideas. I like Renoir, Bergman, Visconti, Kurosawa, Tarkovski, Truffaut, Clouzot, Hitchcock, Buñuel, Welles, Fellini, S. Leone, Antonioni, Kitano, Mihalkov, Brass, Avati—though usually I go by movies, not by authors--, I love some American actors—like Brando, Clift, Dean, Rourke, Van Cleef, Bruce Willis, Depp, Pitt, Stewart, Cotten, Widmark; I don't respect very much the American cinema (--with the usual exceptions—Welles, Ford, Hawks, Wilder, Wyler, Walsh --)—in my own reading, the American cinema went in constant decline, through Huston, Kazan, Ritt, then the so—called New Hollywood directors, then Burton and the Coens and Soderbergh--, but there's plenty else to share tastes and thoughts. Cheers!"

","I liked this movie enough to give a 9. Only flaw worthy of mentioning is probably DiCaprio wasn't really convincing either as a gang leader or a cunning revenge-seeker.

I loved his character and I have seen people who go about being quite as animated or theatrical in real life. He is a very believable and scary gangster.<br/><br/>And if people think the violence is unrealistic, they just have been too lucky not to see the worse side of human nature. Coming from a third world country, I was surprised to see how much some things shown in this movie as happened in NY some 200 years ago looks familiar - e.g. politicians using thugs for their benefit, gangs fighting each other - may be not in 100s and not using knives and axes these days, but still there are things called gang wars out there. And yeah, police doesn't turn up in the middle of a real gang war. This movie piqued my interest enough to read about the real stories behind the movie and found out it's fairly accurate. Guess it's a stage civilisation has to go through from time to time. Even London was a slum a few hundred years ago wasn't it? <br/><br/>Gangs of New York is a movie that is utterly believable and shows some interesting sides of human nature if you are prepared to see it."

I'm a self-confessed very poor historian, so I knew very little about the civil war raging through America in the time this film was set (1860s I believe) and it was only afterwards I discovered that New York had in fact been ruled by gangs during this time period, riddled with violence and bloodshed.<br/><br/>Whenever you watch a Martin Scorsese film, you know you are going to be in for a treat, especially if that film also boasts Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis cast in the two main roles, and this film is certainly no disappointment. The film is slow, and focuses more of the build up of characters, tension and atmosphere, and although some who are used to the more action packed, fast paced movies Hollywood has spewed out in the last decade may find it too slow to keep their interest, I actually found it fascinating, and never lost interest once throughout (which, considering it's length, is quite an achievement).<br/><br/>DiCaprio delivers well (though I still believe that his performance as Billy Costigan in 'the Departed' is the best I've ever seen him), as does Daniel Day-Lewis - both play their parts with the skill and talent that has allowed them to build such a name for themselves over the years. I was also impressed by Brendan Gleeson and his portrayal of Walter McGinn, but found the remainder of the performances mediocre - there was nothing especially bad about them, but nothing to deserve further praise either.<br/><br/>I'm not the biggest fan of films about gangs, or mob wars, but a film doesn't have to belong in my favourite genre for me to appreciate it's quality and give it the respect and recognition it deserves. 'Gangs of New York' is not my typical favourite film, but I recognise that it is very good none the less, with a very thought-provoking ending that asks us to question where what we see around us now had once come from."

","Martin Scorcese is rightly considered one of cinema's all-time greatest directors, having made some true classics such as ""Taxi Driver"" and some great films like ""The Aviator."" ""Gangs of New York"" is a good film, but not his best.<br/><br/>William Cutting, aka Bill the Butcher (the brilliant Daniel Day-Lewis), rules over The Five Points, with everyone, including the corrupt politician Boss Tweed (Jim Broadbent) working for him in some way or another. But his control is wavering as Irish immigrants are flooding into the country. Bill hates this, and a rivalry forms over the control of The Five Points between Bill's Nativists, and the immigrants' Dead Rabbits, lead by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). During a bloody battle, Bill kills Priest, and Priest's son, Amsterdam, is sent to an orphanage. Years later, Amsterdam (now played by Leonardo DiCaprio) rises through the ranks of Bill's gang in order to get revenge.<br/><br/>On the surface, this is a simple revenge story. But Scorcese takes us to another time and place, and creates a world that is both violent and whimsical. In a way, it's like Dickens as told by Scorcese.<br/><br/>The acting is solid across the board. Daniel Day-Lewis is outstanding as Bill the Butcher, being both sadistic and human at the same time. He outshines everyone else, but that doesn't mean that everyone else is bad. Leonardo DiCaprio is solid as Amsterdam Vallon, but he's been better. Perhaps the most surprising performance comes from Cameron Diaz. Known mainly for comedy, Diaz throws herself into the role, and while not the BEST performance, she's still great, and more than holds her own against the other thespians. It proves that she has more range than previously thought, and should get more dramatic roles. There are also a lot of familiar faces sprinkled in amongst the ensemble, and all give great performances. Liam Neeson's appearance at the beginning is brief, but it's always refreshing to see him. John C. Reilly, Jim Broadbent, and Brendan Gleeson are also here. Henry Thomas, little Elliot from ""ET"" is here, all grown up, and it's clear that he hasn't outgrown his acting ability.<br/><br/>The problem is that ""Gangs of New York"" is overlong, and there are long stretches where it gets kind of boring. The scene where people are trying to rig the votes for sheriff is a case in point. It's too long and feels unnecessary. The action sequences are well-done, but sometimes the cuts are too quick and have some awkward moments. The ending is especially disappointing. It's confusing and pretty messy.<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" is a solid film, but it's just not as good as it could have been"

","The movie as a whole was good, but not great. What was great however was Daniel Day-Lewis' performance of Bill the Butcher. Without him this movie would've received a 5 star or lower rating. Leo isn't a bad actor but he was terrible here, not at all believable. Cameron Diaz had the worst Irish accent I've ever heard, that was a huge casting mistake. I liked the portrayal of Boss Tweed and I liked Brendan Gleeson in this.<br/><br/>The story wasn't anything special. Typical boy trying to avenge his father's death sort of thing. Visually it looked good and I admired the attempt of bringing a seemingly lost era of American History to life but if you read the book ""Gangs of New York"" you'd see many a historical error. Another thing that bothered me was hearing The Butcher go on and on about how he respected the Priest and such, yet a man essentially cut from the same cloth, Monk (Gleeson), he had no problem bushwhacking from behind (that has nothing to do with Day-Lewis I put that all on the writers).<br/><br/>Overall watch it you'll enjoy it but don't expect the world of it."

","How do you perceive New York? Idle musing at Times square, busy Walls Street, large snail like movement of traffic? Ever-young city, always living at present. But this not the New York of Martin Scorsese. His New York is different where blood flows like cheap wine from drum, bodies fall like nine pins, no it's not a film on 9/11. Scorsese shows the dark period of the history of the city. This is the time when the city is changing its character, from a provincial town it'll turn to a Cosmo polis. It's a film on immigration problem of mid 19th c, Irish were deserting homeland for a better pasture. Natives were enraged by this inflow of cheap labor. The city was ruled by hooligans, rowdy gangs. Scorsese brilliantly portrayed this struggle through a typical Hollywood narrative of revenge story. Being an Italian immigrant by birth, he knew exactly what is like to be in an alien country. Scorsese drew his material from an account of the city's mid 19th c underworld published in 1927 by a journalist. He created a three-hour long script of action drama, breathtaking to watch. Ferreti, the set designer of Fellini, recreated the city in a studio of Rome. One will never fill bored due to a great handling of camera & editing. Action sequences are edited in a great speed, which set the tempo of the film. Especially the knife-throwing scene is elevated to a pure cinematic beauty, portraying the tension between the characters. This is done by fast cutting. Long preparation of the gang war at the beginning is another example of creation of suspense. Daniel Day Lewis brilliantly portrayed the role of Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting, a gang leader & native sympathizer, who literally ruled New York. Cameron Diaz & Di Caprio also acted well. This film is a treat to watch, it combines a good action narrative with a bold statement on immigration problem & current xenophobia of American people. Here lies Scorsese' brilliance as filmmaker."
"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","13 August 2007"," Several basic conventions stand out: acting, sets, costumes but the film changes its mind half way though and thus relegates itself to good rather than great.
","A lot of people may love Martin Scorsese but I feel the best word to use to describe him would be: consistent. Scorsese is showing no evidence of lacking in his more recent stages as a director, in fact The Departed recently won Best Picture and Gangs of New York is still an enjoyable film, albeit not great, for the best part.<br/><br/>With the film set up superbly thanks to a long and bloody street fight and the main character of Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) established, the film looks like it'll go down that route of revenge but that's the one major thing that sticks out  it changes its mind half way through. Apart from Amsterdam's backstory, returning to New York and rising the ladder in order to get closer to his revenge; the film isn't really about anything. For some reason, Amsterdam isn't in every scene but when revenge is the story's drive, how should be. Instead, we get a few nothing scenes set in an office full of caged birds and just general chat involving the antagonist Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Day-Lewis).<br/><br/>Once most of the dross settles down, Gangs of New York evolves into exactly what I thought it would be: A well shot, brilliantly choreographed, well acted film about one man's rise up the male dominated world of gangs and gangsters. Amsterdam gets into fist fights, actually helps out Bill now and again to gain extra trust, has encounters with the loose women that populate that world and just generally hangs out and makes friends. Why the film couldn't remain like this, only the filmmakers will know.<br/><br/>Although it sounds fantastic, there are still one or two things that just stick out. The strangest of which was the feeling I got when I wasn't sure whether or not I was supposed to laugh. There are some scenes that just don't seem to need to be there; the one in particular is the hanging scene: was it meant to be funny? What was the point of it? and Why didn't those 'guilty' put up more of a fight to escape if they'd done nothing? You see, scenes like this and a few others from memory just don't seem to have a purpose  if it was to emphasise Bill's evilness then it was still unnecessary.<br/><br/>These few things aside, Gangs of New York will counteract anything negative with something positive. The scene Amsterdam and Bill share after the orgy is particularly memorable as not only do we find out more about Bill than we already knew but we also get the feeling Amsterdam has won his trust. There's also a scene involving Irish immigrants coming of the boats as soldiers (who probably aren't coming back) go on  fuelling the racist hate the film has simmering throughout it. Two fantastic scenes that contain so much more than meets he eye but why the pointless scenes are included anyway is beyond me. Like I said earlier, the revenge plot line I had hoped for came but unfortunately; then went. Gangs of New York then turns political as a twist involving Amsterdam and Bill occurs and they must now go against one another in the form of words; a sort of 'Cold War' between the hero and the villain if you like. This was different and consequently disappointing although the final payoff is enjoyable and leaves a good feeling of closure.<br/><br/>I labelled Scorsese 'consistent' in my opening but this particular film is 'inconsistent'. It starts out on a revenge path, contains elements of racism but turns political and what with the World Trade Centre involved at the end, it's like the film's trying to give a message that nobody really wants to hear but with brilliant sets and misé-en-scene, Gangs of New York is worth a look."

"kennyevans","7","0","0","23 April 2007"," Visually Stunning Epic that didn't quite cut the masterpiece mustard.
","I had missed this film first time around and it took 5 years for me to finally watch it. When you think Scorsese and actors like Lewis, Broadbent and Neeson you tend to think that it'll be worth watching at the very least.<br/><br/>I think Scorsese was on a historical mission as much as anything with this film. The story was so weak that it had to be the portrayal of the times and the birth of a city/nation that was the real focal point of the film. Had I seen this at the time I would have been worrying about DiCaprio's casting, but now I'm convinced he's one of the best young actors around. Cameron Diaz I thought was miscast and never really did it for me in the role of promiscuous pickpocket Jenny. Accents from all non Irish actors were all over the place but it was forgivable! Then we of course come to Lewis in what must be his most brilliant role to date. His portrayal of The Butcher was nothing short of menacing, nasty, slimy and quite literally frightening. He showed his vicious potential throughout the film but his brutal murder of Monk McGrinn on the doorstep of his shop was shocking, as was his treatment of the would be assassin in the theatre.<br/><br/>There was a lack of character development for me, particularly with DiCaprios character. There was much that was not shown about who he was and even where he lived and slept! Also The Butcher, how did he get so evil? What motivated his actions and why did he live in squalor? However it was kind of good to be kept thinking about what the characters got up to as well! The set and costume design were amazing. I didn't find the gore overwhelming and if anything it was underplayed as I'm sure with the weapons shown, things would have been a whole lot messier during the many fights the gangs had during that period. The whole thing was played out around a simple revenge style plot and the end was already given at the start as we see the young Amsterdam take the knife used to kill his father and bury it. For a 3 hour film it never felt sluggish, all the time we were kept moving and the story continued to unfold albeit heading for the inevitable ending.<br/><br/>So we are treated to a visual feast: huge crowd scenes, lavish extensive sets, great atmosphere and lighting and very little in the way of digital FX to weigh it down. One nice touch for me was the ending time lapse sequence where we see New York grow from the ramshackle wooden buildings of the 1860's right up to the modern day. Interesting too that the twin towers were included in the clip although they were destroyed almost a year previous in the 9-11 attacks. A tribute from the staunch New Yorker Scorsese no doubt.<br/><br/>A good film for me and Lewis's performance will linger as a benchmark for many years. A masterpiece? The miscasting and weak storyline prevent it from earning the title, but as far as direction and the production values, it's almost there."

","Daniel Day-Lewis is magnificent in his portrayal as Bill the Butcher. He steals nearly every scene he is in. He really envelopes the character. He should have won the Oscar for this performance. I felt the movie as a whole was a enjoyable movie watching experience. Was it overrated? Maybe. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. The supporting cast does a fine job, especially Brenden Gleeson and John C. Reilly. I did kind of feel sorry for Leo after this film was released, only for the reason that I felt it unfair they tried to have him carry this film, and that's not good. He had to act opposite one of the finest actors in film or stage. That's quite a feat. Also, I felt the sets, costumes and screenplay were top notch, and the editing and cinematography done very well too. Because of the film being a Scorsese film with a star studded cast, I feel people's expectations were through the roof, expecting for it to be one of the best movies they have seen. It's not, but it is a fine film nonetheless."

","I saw this film by recommendation and i have to say despite its large amounts of violence it was rather enjoyable. Martin S. takes a rather overlooked part of history and makes it into something grand and gritty. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the role of Amsterdam perfectly, he makes his character such an unlikable and hopeless antagonist quite out of the norm, you can't help but applaud his characterization. The violence of the movie sets the mood of the turbulence of the time and the instability. However, I found that their was not much depth for a film of this length making it feel short and a bit more like a sketch. Despite this i would highly recommend it as well"

","Strangely enough this film about New York at the time of the Civil War is more about the end of the hellish gate to some kind of lawless and wild wild west it is living through than its real depiction. New York was the immigrating harbor and as such had an enormous and constantly changing population. The turn-over as they say today was extremely rapid. It was also a very cosmopolitan city that accepted all nationalities but also all races. But the political and security organizations and institutions were far from up to what it should have been. In other words, and corruption demultiplied this phenomenon, gangs were everywhere and particularly the good old gang of native Americans, meaning the Americans who had been born in American, in the US, against all the others, the immigrants, the foreigners who come and eat your bread out of your mouth as is well known. Constant fight, constant strife, constant rivalry and daily casualties in a constant violence of every single second, day and night. Killing, hanging, lynching, stabbing, shooting, and so many other variants of these were everyday entertainment and distraction. The film focuses on the Irish as the main opponents of the native American gang. I find the film a little bit complacent as for the picturing and illustrating of this violence, and that pushes other issues a little bit in the background, for instance the rich bourgeoisie of fifth avenue, the merchants and the industrialists. The working class in the sweatshops are not shown either. This is slightly regrettable, because we do not understand then why politicians feel obliged to have some kind of alliance with one gang or the other. They have to choose such an alliance as opposed to the possibility for the working class poor to come together and join forces with the various minorities and fight for their own candidates in the elections. The Civil War provides the best surrounding environment for such a film too because of the anti-draft movement that develops in New York around 1863-64. This anti-draft movement could be the element that might make all the segments of the poor coalesce in one invincible majority. Scorsese shows very well, through the gangs and through the two leaders of native Americans and the Irish, how a possible alliance could have come out of this situation, but the gang war going on prevents basic interests to prevail in the name of jingoistic community interests. Scorsese seems to be wishing for us to believe that gang violence has always been the way for the establishment in New York to sail through all tempests, storms and other social hurricanes. It is a very pessimistic film that opens no perspective whatsoever. Then what about the acting of the various actors ? It is essentially Leornardo Di Caprio that I observed, following his iron hard and steel cold eyes in the film. He is so static most of the time, and when he is not , when he is moving he seems to be sliding slowly across the room, the street or the screen without any body language. Even his face seems to be expressionless except for his eyes. He looks like an actor who has risen or been raised in an environment of violence that has left some kind of shock in him, the shock that makes him step back, melt in the wall tapestry and keep out of trouble all the time. Will he ever learn how to use his body to express feelings, action, speed, and so many elements that have to be made visible on the screen because they cannot be described with words ? He has a real problem now his adolescent looks and naivety and charm have gone and he is obliged to move a body and move in it that has become slightly too heavy for him. Having seen what he did in The Departed, I believe he can learn, but he definitely still has a lot to improve.

","There's no need to announce with titles that you're seeing a Scorsese film, any more than, say Kubrick, DePalma, or Adrian Lyne. His trademark is the visual depiction of violent, physical conflict as something palatable.<br/><br/>With ""Taxi Driver"", what mattered was tone...with ""Raging Bull"", a man who cannot square himself with the world's circle...with ""Casino"", the notion of the surveillance eye.<br/><br/>Here, we get mostly Scorsese-paint-by-numbers: the delivery of a vicarious thrill from seeing his characters chop each other up. Oh, the detail is splendid. The problem is, we've seen this before; less competently ('Titanic') or fairly competently ('Master and Commander'); the 'look how true this is to the period details' showing off that adorns the simple inevitability of the central story. Oddly, the more that Scorsese's scenes teem with extras and all their minutiae, the more fake and distant this seems.<br/><br/>And the more movies in this vein that I see, the more that 'Barry Lyndon' stands alone as the supreme costume drama - where the cinematic vision comes first, and the story is incidental."

The scenario for Gangs of New York is set in the mid-1860's. Before the plot reaches it's conclusion, several of the leading characters meet their demise . . . including one of the protagonists and the ""bad guy"", Bill the Butcher. As the film ends, the burial site for these characters is shown as a small well kept cemetery just across the river from Manhattan Island, which appears in the background. What follows is a sequence of scenes that takes place at exactly the same location but at intervals of roughly 50 years apart . . . as the cemetery slowly falls into rubble before disappearing completely by the final (current day) scene . . . while, in the background, we see the skyline of Manhattan undergoing a similar ""evolutionary"" development from the 1800's to the present. Thus, as the film ends, we have the sense that the characters in this film (fiction based on fact, by the way) have faded into history . . . almost as if they never existed at all.

","I have read only the first few comments on this film, so may be repeating what someone else has said. So far I have not noticed anyone comment on the relationship between Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam, which is one of the core pieces of the plot. Not knowing who he is, Bill comes to see him as the son he never had, especially after Amsterdam saves his life - later he thinks this is only because he wants to take it himself, but I think Di Caprio gives the suggestion that he is, unwillingly, drawn to Bill as a father figure, nd pleased that he respected Amsterdam's own father, whom he killed (and who had previously beaten Bill but spared his life). The theme of a man taking in his enemy's son, who later is driven by the inexorable laws of feuding to kill him, appears in at least one of the Icelandic sagas, and this is an indication of the primeval nature of the plot - it is an epic or saga.<br/><br/>Of course Day-Lewis gives a marvellous performance as Bill the Butcher; but Di Caprio's does not really get us so close to what he is really thinking - what I have written above is very much my own impression. Day-Lewis's accent was not the only one that was all over the place; a lot of the time, Diaz seemed to be sounding Irish - but why would she, if brought up by a 'native'? Bill's hostility to the Irish is, of course, because he is a (bigoted) Protestant and they are Catholics.<br/><br/>I was pleased to learn from a review that some details of the Draft Riots as shown were the 'artistic licence' of the writer and director. But I agree with those who think that the presentation of the New York of the day was marvellous, creating a believable if rather alarming world. The battle scene at the beginning, if not wholly realistic or true to the actual nature of gang fights, was absolutely tremendous. But the whole thing dragged rather in the second half - and Di Caprio recovers *remarkably* quickly from a knife wound in the stomach!"
"policy134","7","0","0","26 February 2006"," Trying too hard to top his other films, Scorsese was shunned by the Academy yet again
","Martin Scorsese is of course the greatest filmmaker of our time and he proved that the gangster film was not merely an excuse to portray guys in fancy suits and shootouts. All of his previous films, except The Age of Innocence and Kundun are set in modern times and while the setting of this film allowed Scorsese to give the film a more extravagant look, I thought it was an immense disappointment. The biggest problem is the rather muddled character development. I didn't really feel that the characters were believable which is strange because the film is supposedly based on reality. The Daniel Day-Lewis character was by far the most developed and he should have won an Oscar for it.<br/><br/>The two other leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz are totally unbelievable, both as the characters they are playing and also that they should be attracted to each other. And in risking to get a thousand hate mails, I think that Diaz is way out of DiCaprio's league, not acting wise but in the maturity of their appearances. There has always been a childish demeanor about DiCaprio which is probably why he only portrayed Howard Hughes in the early part of his life in Scorsese's most recent epic The Aviator.<br/><br/>I just wondered why it took me so long to comment on this film because I am usually prone to share my opinions on all of Scorsese's work (look at my other commentaries) and I think the reason is this: Though I think that this is the worst Scorsese film I have seen it is unlike anything else that has ever been filmed before. Filmmakers have usually been concentrating on the west when films are set before the 20th century and to see a New York setting before the Godfather trilogy took place is an innovative idea but the story lacks clarity and that is very risky in a 3 hour film. The best reason to see this is the performances and Liam Neeson gives the film a bravura opening and Jim Broadbent is also credible as an American gang lord. Other than that it is mostly a chance to see Scorsese make a visual spectacle that he would continue in The Aviator. To put this to rest; no, I didn't think Chicago was better deserving of the Best Picture Oscar but Scorsese wasn't snubbed by the Academy for no reason."
"paul2001sw-1","7","0","0","15 February 2006"," Blood without grit
","Martin Scorcese had wanted to make 'Gangs of New York' for many years; but given his exceptional track record as a director, it's a surprisingly middle-brow epic, albeit one that entertains throughout its great length. Like his best movies, it focuses on the criminal underclass, and contains considerable quantities of violence. But whereas Scorcese's most famous works are modern, naturalistic in feel, feature anti-heroes and debunk the myth of nobility and honour among thieves, 'Gangs of New York' is not only a period drama but also theatrical (in dialogue and construction), has a conventionally hero-centric story and indulges the myths that its predecessors iconclastically rejected. In fact, with a classic Hollywood love story, an interest in class warfare, some psychopathic villains, an apocalyptic backdrop to an intimate climax, and Leonardo diCaprio wandering round unconvincingly like a refugee from the 21st century, the film has even something of the feel of 'Titanic'; whereas the massed battles in hellish cellars and work-houses even bring to mind 'The Lord of the Rings'. The film is deeper than those two movies; the surprising thing is that the differences are so small.<br/><br/>One can point to a few oddities as well. Unlike most American films, the settled Americans (the ""natives"") are the bad guys (and the Irish immigrants the heroes); yet the lead native is played by (Irishman) Daniel Day Lewis, while (the American) diCaprio is chief among the Irish. And diCaprio's face shows a remarkable ability to recover from a supposedly disfiguring wound. These are minor points. The more substantive criticisms are more objections to the type of film Scorcese has chosen to make, rather than to its skillful execution: in telling the tale of a forgotten part of American history, he has done so symbolically, filming a story both grand and personal, but creating a world which never quite feels as real as that of 'Mean Streets' or 'Taxi Driver'. The result is a film that is fabulous in the word's original sense: a 19th century fable. But I prefer his grittier works."

","Warning: spoilers.<br/><br/>In the squalid underworld of 1850's New York, moustachioed lunatic Bill the Butcher leads gangs of established Americans against immigrant (mainly Irish) gangs, led by the more friendly Priest Vallon. In a pitched battle Bill kills Vallon, and Vallon's young son escapes. A dozen years later, Vallon's now adult son Amsterdam returns to the city incognito, to worm his way into Bill's gang and assassinate him in revenge.<br/><br/>Here is a book that cried out to be filmed. Instead of following Herbert Asbury's questionably accurate history book through a hundred years, Scorcese focuses on the Draft Riots of the Civil War, blending the most notorious characters of the day to create imaginary figures who are largely based on life. <br/><br/>The first impression I had was of staggering squalor, as the gangs of the Five Point tenements fight over turf and the feeble proceeds of theft. The second was of an almost cartoonish, grotesque violence: it's as though Dickens' characters have gone berserk. People knife, beat and hack one another to death; ears and noses are sliced off, bodies hacked as casually as the meat that Bill serves up for a living. Over it all preside the corrupt politicians of Tammany Hall, using the gangs to intimidate voters their way. Nobody is clean.<br/><br/>Scorcese's New York looks incredible. The sets are astonishing, and the production lavish. The only jarring visual aspect is that the actors are not more disease-ridden and sickly. Even the battle-scenes, oddly, are a little squeaky-clean, despite their striving for gritty realism. In one fight, Amsterdam punches a man five times in the face, who a few minutes later is seen without even a trace of a black eye. Given the savagery of the rest of the film - it wholly deserves its certificate - it is surprising that this has been cleaned away. Not that one would want to see much more gore than there already is...<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good, overall. Brendan Gleeson is solid, if unexceptional, Liam Neeson (Priest Vallon) is excellent but underused, and Cameron Diaz adapts to the underworld surprisingly well. Top marks, though, must go to Daniel Day Lewis as the ogre-like, deranged Bill the Butcher, by turns Jolly Uncle and glowering maniac. Dandyish and brutal, he is both overplayed and convincing, like Anthony Hopkins' Lecter. The only weak link is Leonardo Di Caprio as Amsterdam, who is far too slick and pretty for this kind of world. He would not make a convincing Victorian shop assistant, let alone a hardened killer.<br/><br/>The most serious flaw in the film, however, comes two thirds of the way through. Amsterdam is alone and weak, apparently without face in the underworld, and suddenly ten men spring to his side and help him form a gang of his own. No reason is given for this: the impression given all along is that the gangsters are ruthless and untrustworthy, even joining up with Bill against their fellow Irishmen if it furthers their careers. It feels as through the end hour has been badly cut, and it damages the film.<br/><br/>The finale is unmitigatedly downbeat, as a racist mob runs amok in order to avoid the draft. It is hard to tell whether we are to pity these people or see them as savages, and the meaning of the ending is unclear. If America was born in the streets, as the tag line suggests, it was born from vicious rioters, not the honest toil of proleterians, as the film seems to want to suggest. You can read the ending two ways: perhaps the riot does bring solidarity to the people of New York, or perhaps it is the final outburst of a conflict that even Amsterdam seems to recognise as pointless at the end of this flawed, grimly magnificent film."

","In this movie, Protestant Italians face off against Roman Catholic Irish, and are sometimes visited by ""Anglo-Dutch"" rich Christians. My favorite line in Martin Scorsese's commentary is his statment, ""It probably is unfair to say Anglo-Dutch because I think-- whatever that American stock was that came from the 17th Century..."" Yes, quite the historian, eh? He crammed a bunch of Chinese into the movie with the defense that we don't know that they weren't there, but he completely ignored a very large population of Germans, who we do know were there. In fact, my Mom's family was part of a group of 30 thousand people who landed in New York in 1710 from Germany. But this movie never rises to the level of accuracy that needs concern itself with such details. As Mr. Scorsese says, this is a mix of fiction (or opera) and fact, the facts being used when useful to the story. It is science fiction in reverse. My impression, which I had many times, even when I first watch the movie, was that it was a live-action comic book. Several scenes really look like pages from a modern comic book (a good example is the scene in which Priest Valleron poses in front of his assembled gang before the battle)."

","Perhaps unfairly I was kind of indifferent to seeing GONY mainly due to the surprising cast choices that was headlining, and it seems my fears had merit. Sure Liam's the man, tall and stricking and so obviously suited to being an Irish leader in a strange land, but (Spoiler herein) he's in it for all of ten minutes. Yup. That leaves us with the marvellous Day-Lewis who again is perfectly placed to his role, but this movie is about scores of characters - gangs - and not just one man. Unfathomably, DiCaprio is exactly the same character as his Titanic counterpart - I swear he's even wearing the same costume. Sure he throws us a little irish twang but other than that it's Jack Dawson through and through. I'm surprised he didn't teach Diaz to spit. Speaking of Mz Diaz - urgh, how does she get work? It's certainly not by expanding her character roles. If Daniel Day-Lewis' acting range goes from A to Z then Cameron Diaz's goes from A to A. And A's not that great in the first place. So yes, I wasn't thrilled with the cast.<br/><br/>But what of the story, the direction, the sets? Well story-wise it's all by the numbers; no surprises and no major twists, turns or great moments that enable the viewer to feel the road is leading somewhere. It's a long drawn out straight-line which left me zero ability to share any sort of affinity with the characters or their lives. They seem to be 'playing' at life and despite the ultra gore in places I still felt everything was nice and safe. With a few cuts for content it could be edited to three neat little one hour specials and shown on network TV. Fisher-price filmaking.<br/><br/>The set (after all there really is only one major set) is stunning albeit a little clean, but hey - send me a postcard of it and I'll save three hours of my life.<br/><br/>For a movie entrenched in the dark era of 19th century New York I expected something grittier, wittier and not so prettier."

","I fell asleep shortly after the beginning of the 2nd act so you might say that I am not entitled to write a review on a film that I haven't even finished. Well, tough. <br/><br/>Having received so much positive buzz at the Academy Awards I was more than eager to watch GoNY. I always intend to watch any movie with open ears and an open mind, while trying not to listen to the opinions of others. This was the very rare film that I just could not get through. Do not get me wrong, there were several aspects that I did find redeemable. The meticulously designed sets and costumes are certainly nice eye candy and the cinematography was occasionally stunning. However, visual impressions can only carry a film so far.<br/><br/>The acting was mediocre, save for Daniel Day-Lewis who breaks free from the weak script and gets more out of his character than probably was written. His portrayal of Bill the Butcher is razor sharp and always believable as he easily creates one of cinema's most memorable villains. Cameron Diaz is okay at best but I just had a hard time accepting her as an Irish woman, in a period piece epic no less. Now let's move on to Leo Dicaprio. I have never been too fond of his acting, except in What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Titanic, and his performance in GoNY is no exception; he was grossly miscast as the young lead. He always seems distant and uninterested throughout, not to mention the fact that his Irish accent is shaky and is ALWAYS coming and going which is incredibly annoying. Supporting performances were fine but forgettable because of weakly written characters, especially John C. Reilly who I kept wanting to see more of. All of his other roles in 2002 (Chicago, The Hours, The Good Girl) were terrific as he would have been here but he is sadly held back by other problems.<br/><br/>The script was very weak and did not have much direction; it just meandered here and there for too long. It was not until Bill is spouting a monologue to Amsterdam that things get somewhat interesting and the story might have a definite course. Unfortunately but by that time my eyelids were so heavy from the material that proceeded this that the monologue was not able to compensate. Most of the dialogue was contrived, constantly awkward and at times extremely uncomfortable. It just seemed to me that the writers were trying to cram in as many racial derogatory terms as they possibly could. The ""love story between DiCaprio and Diaz,"" which was the worst love/hate relationship I have ever seen on screen, was unnecessary. If there is going to be an inclusion of a love subplot it has to be done right or not at all. Their obligatory love scenes were awfully forceful and hard to swallow.<br/><br/>Howard Shore's score greatly disappointed me, especially since I have been such a fan of his past work. In the opening battle scene he oddly picks an alternative rock piece that is as out of place as could be and all of the compositions were awfully simplistic.<br/><br/>Scorsese's direction was fine, and that is all it was, fine. Oscar-worthy? Hardly. Nothing at all special compared to what he has done in the past. For me it was just lacking something.<br/><br/>I can understand how critics and audiences can just eat this film up because of how manipulatively patriotic it is after the 9/11 tragedy. I, however, did not buy into it. I just do not understand how much attention this film got. I should try watching it again without falling asleep which I do intend on doing. But as it is, GoNY, so far, gets a 5 out of 10 from me."

","Gangs of New York, may not be the movie you would want to take your kids to, or maybe yourself to, on a lazy Sunday afternoon. It is pretty heavy and replete with blood and gore. Scorcese shows you the street life in New York in 1860's without bothering too much to mop up the red stuff.<br/><br/>
As most would want you to believe, it is not a simple story of revenge and bad blood. It is rather a saga of violence, a dormant factor in any fledgling urban society. And dont believe them when they tell you the film preaches violence. The film has all the right tones to strike sanity into a hardened bludger and exorcise the sense of glory out of him.<br/><br/>
I find it pretty puzzling how most people who saw the film missed the brilliant images, the hallmark of a great director. The opening scene where the battlefield and the battle itself is shown bit by bit, exposing the viewer to the stark street reality in phases with exploding music, until you sit up in rapt attention, is a teaser for the main course. The scene where the grim-faced soldiers drafted for the civil war, board the war-ships just as coffins descend over the ropes, and the one where three different people pray to three different Gods, in as many ways, for as many ends are just a few examples. The way the movie ends makes it a must see. All I can tell you is watch the movie to the very end. The last 30 minutes might just make all the difference to change your opinion, if you already were on the verge of forming (a negative) one."

The performances are outstanding, especially the one of Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher, but I also liked Di Caprio's, Liam Neeson's and Cameron Diaz' roles. Not to speak of the set design and the costumes, which are the best I've seen since Shakespeare in Love. The movie is supported by a great score, especially in the first gangfight scene. It makes it look more brutal than it actually is. And now there's something I've got to critizise. The movie got some very bad ratings in Germany, especially due to its violence. I don't think that the violence level is pushed too far. There is just enough violence as the story needs to be believable and shocking. I think the cutting and pacing doesn't show that much of violence like in Black Hawk Down for example. One thing I didn't like is the Scene where Bill the Butcher ""disfigures"" Di Caprio's character. I mean one scar more or less, what's the difference, in the end you can hardly see the scar. A little bit more would've been great here, but maybe the studio didn't want Di Caprio running around like the Elephant Man or something like that.

This is a drama combined with action, where the butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) is the perfect villain while the young man Amsterdam (DiCaprio)is coming back to his town to revenge his father's death. Actually the plot is not complicated and it goes directly to the end all expect, but the most important aspect of the film is to see how New York was developing already at that time and how difficult was to live for all those emigrants who worked hard and may not see after their contribution. At certain point of the film it reminded me the novel ""The Jungle"" of Upton Sinclair, which reveals the suffering of many emigrants in US.

Something odd happens to this movie about half-time through. For the first half, for all the bloodshed and slowness, it's a strangely comfortable experience, like getting on a suburban train and finding yourself in a Pullman Car. Even though the pace is slow, you spend the time admiring the sheer quality of the experience. You can even bear the pointless diversion of the Diaz/di Caprio romance...<br/><br/>(Spoiler ahead...) ...then, after Vallon's first attempt on Bill the Butcher's life it all goes pear shaped and horribly rushed (much like, it occurs to me, the latter stages of David Lynch's Dune). After a few applications of the magic sponge by Cameron Diaz, the disfigured and humiliated Vallon gets his looks back and, in a magical evolution, becomes the leader of all the Irish immigrants in New York. Then as the epic draws to its close the whole plot gets eclipsed by the New York draft riots, which seem to have barged in, Blazing Saddles style, from a neighbouring sound stage. The closing song by U2 suggests that it was petty thieves and thugs who were the ""Hands that Built America"" rather than, say, the black folks who make cameo appearances in the movie hanging from lampposts.<br/><br/>I suspect the major problems with this film stem from the effect that Irish themes have on American directors and actors, which is rather similar to putting a powerful magnet next to a piece of sensitive electronic equipment. You'd have thought Scorsese might be immune to this brain-scrambling, but at some point he must have said: ""Diaz? Di Caprio? Perfect for our Irish leads!""<br/><br/>None of this should be taken to detract from the wonderful performance of Daniel Day Lewis (even if he does have a touch of the Michael Palins every now and then).

Don't get me wrong I loved the Riots scenes and the whole morse code voice over, but it wasn't dealt with very well and the end parts of the film do look rushed, I can just imagine Harvey Weinstein sitting behind Scorsese and Thelma Scoonmkaer disturbing them to just get the film finnished.   <br/><br/>But like many other great films, this could have been so much better, but i think we should appreciate that one Scorsese might get up and try to re edit and release the full cut.  I actually heard that Scorsese was happy with the Orginal cut and didn't want to do anything else to it to clean it up, can someone please tell me it is not true."

"mhoney-1","7","0","0","30 August 2003"," Overly sensational with one great lead
","Martin Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" takes too much time introducing the audience to the environs of New York City's ""Five Points"" in 1862-63. The story is supposed to be that Amsterdam Vallon is out to avenge the death of his father at the hands of Bill the Butcher. But that's not the story exactly. Before Amsterdam can get much of an idea about where he's going and how he'll get revenge, he allows William Cutting to take him in as a surrogate son, and come to the point of almost loving him. It is not until halfway through the movie, when Amsterdam saves The Butcher's life that he realizes how far he's stooped.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis, as everyone agrees I am sure, gives a fantastic performance as a racist gang leader who pretty much owns all of the Five Points and everyone in them. Leonardo DiCaprio is woefully miscast as Amsterdam Vallon, and it's rather surprising. For an actor as admired at his age for the veritable talent he's shown on-screen, Leonardo cannot pull off a convincing Irish accent. Cameron Diaz as Jenny is similarly handicapped, but her character is given enough redeeming qualities to at least make one want to care for her. The supporting cast is perfect, however, Jim Broadbent as the corrupt William Tweed is almost unrecognizable and seems to act almost like comic relief for all the beaurocratic bull he throws in The Butcher's face. John C. Reilly, star of three of the five Best Picture nominees, also does well as an Irish cop with a big black hole where his heart should be. Brendan Gleason gives his typical strong performance. Henry Thomas, a native of Texas, is a welcome relief when his wholly convincing accent is compared to DiCaprio's half-hearted attempt. And, of course, Liam Neeson, as the fallen ""Priest"" Vallon makes his usial strong performance.<br/><br/>To warrant any feeling for Amsterdam the movie should have not wandered so far from his story of vengeance before returning to his mission. If there were any characters in the movie worth caring for, whether they died or not, the movie would be more enjoyable. I admired that the whole movie was shot on a set in Rome, but if the movie didn't LOOK like a set, then maybe it would've been easier to swallow. The Butcher, Monk McGinn, Priest, Jenny, and Johnny were all developed enough to care. You never wanted Bill to win the fight, but at least you could understand him. Not so with Amsterdam. The climactic Draft Riots of 1863 were well-staged. A chapter in our history worth taking not of. So too was Boss Tweed, the man who ran Tammany Hall until he was convicted by the Thomas Dewy of the 1800s, Samuel Tilden. But while Scorsese wanted to make a movie chronicling the underworld of New York and the Irish immigrants, his unflinching examination of the Five Points gangs, and nothing but, leave a nasty taste in your mouth."

","Pretty impressive movie.  Scorsese has done better, but this is still well worth watching.  Daniel Day-Lewis gives an amazing performance as the villain.  The story is a little disjointed at times, but still a powerful story of revenge and redemption.  Scorsese does a fantastic job of setting the historical context during this period in New York.  You really experience the corruption, thievery, and lawlessness of early New York, even the total disorganization of the police and fire crews.  My biggest complaint is that we see so little of Liam Neeson and don't hear much about his story.  Most of the story is played out through DiCaprio's character who plays his son.  Yes the movie is bloody, but is a realistic portrayal of a street war.  A pretty original movie about a forgotten time in New York."
"szyslak","9","0","0","15 August 2003"," Minor flaws, but still a great film
","Is ""Gangs of New York"" Scorsese's best film? Is ""Richard the Third"" Shakespeare's best play? Most Scorsese fans would rightly rank ""Taxi Driver"" and ""GoodFellas"" above ""Gangs,"" just as Shakespeare scholars would tell you ""Hamlet"" and ""King Lear"" are more complex and better characterized than the still-great ""Richard."" Ultimately, such distinctions don't matter. ""Gangs""' minor flaws don't distract from what's ultimately a great (if not perfect) film.<br/><br/>Scorsese begins with a simple story that owes its soul to, if not ""Hamlet,"" at least ""The Lion King."" Some view the lack of plot complexity as a flaw, but I think the bare-bones story structure is just the right choice for this film. Because Scorsese doesn't have to juggle a lot of disparate, clunky plot threads, he can give this film what it needs: a colorful, fascinating palate of well-drawn characters and impressive visuals. I never believed I was seeing anything but the roiling, filthy, angry underbelly of a nation confronting its turbulent adolescence. The concise plot allows Scorsese to work his magic as the greatest visual artist in modern American cinema.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's performance isn't exactly earth-shattering; we haven't seen what he's truly capable of since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" Many have complained about his off-Irish accent, but I don't think that's a big issue. Remember that Amsterdam Vallon spends most of his life in New York. Most children of immigrants, then as now, sport a ""halfway"" accent, not quite American but not quite that of the Old Country. Cameron Diaz manages to let us forget ""Charlie's Angels"" for a few hours. As much fun as it was to see her wiggle her ass at the camera, here she proves that she can indeed act. And what can I say about Daniel Day Lewis' performance that hasn't already been said? Like Denzel Washington in ""Training Day,"" Lewis' Bill the Butcher is a very evil man who convincingly and seductively becomes a slick, personable charmer when need be. Lewis gives one of the great performances of the past few years.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Gangs of New York""'s minor, unimportant flaws don't distract from what is ultimately a great film. Not every movie needs a complex, challenging storyline. It worked for ""Pulp Fiction,"" but wouldn't have worked for ""Gangs."" Scorsese's key accomplishment is in realizing that, and using his inimitable visual skill to create a fascinating, engrossing film that seems far shorter than its three hours. It's not Scorsese's best, but like Shakespeare he has plenty of competition from his own work. 9/10"

The main strength of the picture is the dominating, Oscar-caliber performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. It's hard to grade a film like this, because Scorsese is basically competing against himself.

","Warning: potential spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio:<br/><br/>No.  NO.  He is not suited for this role.  At all.  There's not even a hint of an Irish accent anywhere throughout the film.  I admit, he was incredible in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but here...he lacked the presence, the accent and the soul and is reduced to a shallow puddle compared to the roaring ocean that is Daniel Day-Lewis' William Cutting.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz:<br/><br/>Much the same here.  No accent.  No presence.  No soul.  Admittedly, it's a fairly limited character, but she was noticeably bad in the way Queen Amidala was in the last star wars movie.<br/><br/>Also:<br/><br/>There are some minor problems to do with effects and the like.<br/><br/>
1) In the opening battle scene, there are some moments when you really notice that  the actors are not really hitting eachother at all, when no blood spurts out when a man is cleaved by a butcher knife.<br/><br/>2) When the riots start, the rocks being thrown seem to float in the air and are noticeably made of styrofoam.<br/><br/>On the plus side...<br/><br/>1)Daniel Day-Lewis delivers.  Of course he does.  Has he been bad in anything?  Not that I know of, and I've seen most of his movies, being his obsessed stalker 'n all.  I am probably biased...but, no one can say that his performance here wasn't powerful.  The thick boston irish accent, the curled mustache, the greasy hair plastered on his sweaty forehead, and his comical but menacing manner...he is transformed.  His performance here by far outweighs that of Adrien Brody in the Pianist.<br/><br/>""It was the finest beating I ever took...my guts was pierced...my ribs was all mashed up...""<br/><br/>One of the most memorable moments in cinematic history, that scene was (dans mon opinion).<br/><br/>2)  There's no doubt about Scorcese's talent as a film maker.

"saska-3","7","0","0","27 July 2003"," A watchable offering that wanders too much
","I confess embarrassment that I had not seen this film until it came out on video.  Having a 2 year old can present obstacles to seeing a film so pervasively violent in the theater.<br/><br/>Thus, fresh from the DVD viewing, three things come immediately to mind:<br/><br/>1. I am really glad I could pause this and go to the bathroom.  I may not have gone back into the theater if I'd purchased a large soda and found myself unable to stay until the end.<br/><br/>2. A budget this big, and this many huge names on both sides of the camera, have made a beautiful and epic movie that loses its way in the story and would never have been greenlighted with a first time director.<br/><br/>3. The fact that this part of American history has been swept under the rug for most publicly-educated citizens makes it hard to follow and even harder to swallow.<br/><br/>Regarding the first point - ""epic"" can mean sweeping and engaging, or it can be a polite way of saying ""really frigging long"".  Kind of like a one-bedroom, half-bath beach house is ""cozy"" or ""charming"".  Off the top of my head, I can map out perhaps 15 real story beats, but a great deal of superfluous environment creation is going on that makes the film 3 hours long.  I was so unclear as to the protagonist's intentions during the second act of the film, I had no idea when or if we were going to get to the end. And when we did, it wasn't in the environment I expected, and the payoff was diluted.  If this were based on a true story, I'd accept it, but the fictional characters were developed inside the structure of history, so there's no reason why we couldn't get the kind of ending the buildup seemed to promise.<br/><br/>Regarding the second point - I think Scorcese was really allowed to run with this.  I know there are rumors that huge parts of the film were cut out, but if that's the case, the fault lies with the director for not cutting the right things.  He seems enamored of the period in history - as I would probably be if I had researched it extensively - but the development of characters suffers for it.  We are left to draw our own conclusions about what should be carrying the plot: the people we are offered as our points of view.<br/><br/>Regarding the third point - I have no idea how to solve this issue.  It's not a movie about a single rarely-discussed battle in a war we all know about tangentially.  It's a movie about (a) religiously-divided gangs in 19th century New York City, (b) fierce nationalism in a newly formed country ,(c) the political and social implications of a draft in a society of newly-arrived immigrants, and (d) a revenge tale carried out across generations between two men impacted by points a-c above.  If this had not been Scorcese, and if he had not gotten DiCaprio and Day-Lewis and Diaz, this film would never have gotten off the ground.  It could have used some pruning before it did.<br/><br/>With all of those complaints out of the way, I still gave this movie a 7 (and this is high for me - I rarely award 9's; only three 10's are in my entire IMDb voting history).  The costuming and set design are fascinating. The battle scenes are bloody, and they might seem over the top, but I suspect that's what it looked like when people hacked each other to death using large handheld implements.  The acting is stellar in some cases (Day-Lewis is great, although not as astounding as I expected from the reviews) and passable in others (DiCaprio has relatively little to do, given the fact that I don't feel his character develops, but he's good at what he's doing).  I can't comment on Diaz's performance because it feels as though her character's entire arc was cut out of the film, leaving only a series of random actions that don't seem consistent.  I think I give it this rating because it did eventually get around to closure, and it showed tremendous attention to detail.  I just didn't like how it got there, and I wondered if some of the detail clouded the overall point.<br/><br/>Story is king in great movies.  ""Gangs"" is good, but not great.<br/><br/>7/10"

","GONY was so long in the making and realisation. It looked as if it might not see the light of day at one stage. One story going the rounds was that Scorsese wanted to release a version lasting over 4 hours and had many arguments with producer Harvey Weinstein concerning the release date and running time. So what do we have? Firstly the movie does look quite edited. The editing is done well but some of the plot does seem disjointed. The set of old NY is great,in fact it is much too good as in admiring it I was losing track of some of the action taking place.Also, because the set is so authentic you are always aware it IS a set and this stops you suspending disbelief and prevents you becoming immersed in the tale.Leo de Caprio never convinces in his role and Cameron Diaz joins the long line of gorgeous prostitutes in the movies a la Julia Roberts though she does her best with a nothing part.And so on to Daniel Day-Lewis. The last thing I had seen him in was The Boxer which was OK.Then he just disappeared.It was said he was working as some kind of craftsman in rural Italy. It was only a matter of time before he returned to the screen. He is too good an actor to be sitting about sewing leather in a Tuscan farmhouse. As Bill The Butcher he is totally menacing. He clearly relishes the part and plays it just the right side of going over the top.A truly memorable screen baddie.The true story of the unrest in NY at the time shown is a fascinating one and despite some shortcomings Scorsese does well. Before it was released there were rumours that GONY was a turkey. It most certainly is not that and,while not a classic,was definitely a worthwhile venture though obviously a pet project for Scorsese.Fantastic on DVD with mucho extras!"

I liked the scene when Jenny and Amsterdam are about to sleep together and he insists on taking off her corset, this was just a simple sign of the times and the love and respect for her. In that time period men didn't bother going to all that trouble to take odd a woman's clothes when they could just lift up there skirt and get just what they wanted. Yes the film was long, but I didn't feel bored at all, the story dragged you into this era and subtly engulfed you in its characters and relevance of it to our every day lives. History has taught us that without suffering there can be no happiness, but at what price should this happiness or peace of mind come? The film has a message of remembrance for what once was and will be, to think of those who came before you and acknowledge there contribution no matter how small or big.

Nastiness beautiful choreographed, skillfully captured on film, but mere nastiness nonetheless.<br/><br/>Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio) returns to the Five Points district looking for revenge on Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis), the gang leader who killed his father years earlier.  The Five Points houses the scum of New York, thieves, murderers, and rapists apparently lurking around every corner.  The story starts to take off when Amsterdam becomes one of Bill's trusted colleagues.  Matters are complicated by the fact that Amsterdam seems to have some genuine affection for the Butcher.<br/><br/>Any depth, however, is effectively lost under the rivers of blood that flow in this film.  I'm not usually offended by violence, but how is anyone going to get anything out of this film if they have to cover their eyes half the time?<br/><br/>The Amsterdam/Cutting plot is intercut with New York politics, and these two stories both come to a head during the famous Draft Riots, filmed in Scorsese's typical kinetic style.  It's a magnificent spectacle.  But what are we supposed to make of the whole thing?  Trailers inform us that ""America Was Born in the Streets.""  The draft riots were a shameful chapter in America's history, not just an act of social uprising, but a chance for many angry New Yorkers to commit heinous acts of violence against African Americans.

Worse, sometimes, you get a mish-mash that is lukewarm and gets forgotten in the fullness of time (Once Upon a Time in America leaps to mind.)<br/><br/>The casting of this film is right and wrong on so many levels that I feel sorry for the director rather than take issue with him. Cameron Diaz and Leo DiCaprio do not belong in this film. It's not to impugn their acting skills, but this movie was simply the wrong vehicle for them. Leonardo DiCaprio is a good actor, but he is not a great one, and the role of Amsterdam needed to be carried by a great actor. The same goes for Cameron Diaz. No offense, but Scorcese should have fired the accent coach for these two principal cast members.<br/><br/>Some events in the story were outright and unnecessary falsehoods. SPOILER ALERT: Federal ships firing on the Five Points not only never happened, but it doesn't make any sense! Why randomly destroy property in a part of the city that was not even a focal point of the riots!? Why risk hitting your own troops?  That plot hole detracted from a story that took great pains to be accurate and faithful to the spirit of that era.<br/><br/>I give Martin Scorcese an A for effort but a C+ for the result. Sorry, dude. In the years to come, this film will be in the same boat as The Patriot and Once Upon a Time in America."

","Gangs of New York is a fairly satisfying film. It is based in the 1800s and follows the plight of ""Amsterdam"" from his early childhood to when he returns to New York as an adult to seek vengeance on ""Bill the Butcher"" who'd slain his father many years before in a gang-fight.<br/><br/>The performances are superb, especially Daniel Day-Lewis who pretty much steals the show as the nasty ""Bill the Butcher"", leader of a gang called the ""Natives"", whose sole aim is to rid New York of the influx of Irish immigrants.<br/><br/>The big problem with the film is that you simply don't care about the characters, other than the three principal leads - Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis. Thus when there's gangwarfare, it's very difficult to know quite who to root for or what's going on.<br/><br/>The film doesn't really answer any questions and opens up many more possibilities than it achieves. This could have been a truly outstanding film, certainly there is enough scope and the look and feel of the 'Five Points' in the 1860s looks spot on. However, it falls short on character development.<br/><br/>Overall, worth watching - be warned that it is fairly violent and bloody (typical Scorsese) but not the masterpiece it could have been."

Gangs of New York is yet another one joining Kundun and Last Temptation of Christ and The Age of Innocence (right there we're talking nine decades alone whihc is ninety years...how old is this guy anyway?). I wish he would return to movies he took only a few years to make like Mean Streets or Taxi Driver or King of Comedy instead of these ingenious, awe inspiring works of overincubated art fart that no one seems to enjoy as much as the man who dealt it.

I'm a big Leonardo fan but gotta say he was miscast.

","A lot of people think this is Scorsese's worst film. Even though that can't be taken as a bad thing since most of his movies are masterpieces, i think this is one of his best. Other than some minor flaws such as the love story and the good but not great ending, this is another great film for an already master director. Most parts of the story can easily be turned into a modern gangster film. It is a movie filled with crime, revenge, and betrayal. Daniel-Day Lewis gives the true greatest performance of the year and one of the best i have seen ever. This is the first Leonardo DiCaprio movie i liked. Titanic sucked and we all know it. Cameron Diaz is delicious in any era and although i didn't like the love story i did like her character.

I'm not being biased here because I'm a Newyorker but c'mon, what's with all of these bad ratings? This movie is one of a kind. The set design alone, along with the fantastic costumes should be enough, but The acting by Daniel Day Lewis was just mind boggling. This man became a character and acted with passion. The academy basically stole the Oscar from him. Leo showed us why he is so inconsistent. He was great in Catch Me If You Can. But in GONY he was bland. Nothing to him, bad irish accent, did not fit the role at all, as well as my lovely favorite actress Cameron Diaz. I thought she was miscast as well, but Bill ""the butcher"" saved the acting aspect in this film. <br/><br/>As far as the story goes, look at it as a documentary. It's a history lesson, and the realism is unmatched. The story does feel a bit rushed, but this movie does not lack heart. I thought it had a lot of it. Altough some actors were miscast, they were not terrible. <br/><br/>I think most people think it's a mindless gory film with no heart. But I disagree. It was a realistic portrait of 19th century NY city.  NYC is still very similar today, and if you think the NYPD is not a gang, then you're nuts. We have our rich, our poor, slums that the politicians don't care about. They rob us here too with outrageous ticket prices. *** stars out of 4.

","To be honest I was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was. I am not a big fan or follower of Leo Dicaprio in any way. As a matter of fact i was planning to explicitly avoid this film because of his involvement in this movie. However as fate played out on a cold Saturday night with 2 friends and nowhere to go. External influences created the opportunity that allowed me to be pleasantly surprised with this film. This movie was good on so many levels that i can't cover everything i liked about it because i liked it so much i can't separate all the parts of the film that i enjoyed. The acting, first of all has to be mentioned. As does the directing, the visual effects, the colours, the costumes and the great plot.<br/><br/>This is certainly not the kind of movie one would expect from a typical Leo movie so in that way this is kind of a ""Anti-Leo"" movie. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis was astounding and the fact that he lost out on the Oscar to the Adrien Brody, is unfortunate. Day-Lewis is clearly heads and shoulders above 99% of actors in the world and his talent is clearly evident in this role, Bill the Butcher Cutting. This is coming from a person who previously despised his earlier movies and refused to watch them. He changed my mind about him and thats a hard thing to do. although i loved this movie, i didn't not change my view of Leo and would not change it unless he pulls off something the way Day-Lewis did, which i can't perceive occurring.<br/><br/>As I was watching this movie I couldn't help but to think that this explains why New York is the way it is now. I mean I don't want to knock an entire city but it's pretty much the same way they portrayed the beginnings of it in this film. Crime everywhere, filthy streets and crooks trying to swindle you any chance they can get. Pretty much the way it is today. Lets not kid ourselves, even New Yorkers know it. I apologize to the decent people in New York but give me a break, this movie mimics real life with an artistic twist and there's no denying it.<br/><br/>So the acting is great, the visuals are powerful and it's an interesting look into the origins of the Great City of New York. I also liked the historical content and accuracy as they added in the scenes of the Irish landing in friendly New York as the escape the horrors of the Irish Potato Famine. 9 out of 10.

"senortuffy","6","0","0","7 July 2003"," Strong cast, weak story.
","For all its pedigree, ""Gangs of New York"" fails to deliver as a movie. Martin Scorcese delivers a sweeping epic of mid-nineteenth century New York, but the film lacks the kind of depth needed to hold the audience's attention for the nearly three hours of running time it takes to unfold.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis plays William Cutting (Bill the Butcher), the leader of a gang of nativists opposed to the immigrants flooding into the city. Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, the son of an Irish immigrant leader who is killed by Bill in the opening scene during a street battle. Cameron Diaz plays a pickpocket who was rescued off the streets by Bill as a child and who falls in love with Vallon.<br/><br/>Scorcese sets the stage and connects all the dots, but the movie just lacks heart.  <br/><br/>As an action movie, where Vallon avenges his father's death, it doesn't work.  One, it takes way too long for Vallon to get his revenge, and two, Daniel Day Lewis is by far the most interesting character in the film.  You don't savor his death the way you would most bad guys in his position, because the hero, as played by DiCaprio, is really rather bland.  Where Lewis is charismatic, DiCaprio just floats through the film and doesn't engender the kind of attachment his counterpart does.  Diaz is introduced into the mix just to satisfy the obligatory love interest.<br/><br/>As a sweeping epic, the film is kind of interesting in that this period of American history is foreign to most of us.  But it lacks the grandeur of a great film.  The sets are pretty flimsy and the photography not that spectacular - not up to the standards he set in ""Goodfellas.""   In some ways, it reminded me of those cheap Sixties gladiator movies shot over in Yugoslavia.  There are some memorable scenes, but not enough to fill up 2 hours and 47 minutes.  Scorcese could have easily edited this down to two hours and still made a decent movie.<br/><br/>Worth watching for Daniel Day Lewis' performance and for the fact that it's Scorcese, but all in all, it's really not a very good movie."

","The potential for the making of this film was tremendous but, in my opinion, ultimately failed to deliver. The setting for the picture - an incredibly interesting chapter in the history of New York City - was not utilised to it's full potential by Scorcese.<br/><br/>I was fascinated by the small historical lessons that were drip fed to me throughout the film. Although, I appreciate that the studio is not in the business of financing 3-hour history lessons, I felt that the viewer could have learned a lot more and still have been entertained at the same time, had the movie been structured in the right way.<br/><br/>The visual effects of the film are quite stunning and in this respect it truly is an epic. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is, as you come to expect from this fine actor, quite extraordinary. His screen presence alone makes up for most of the film's shortcomings. By this, I mean that I would recommend seeing the film purely to experience this particular performance. It is fair comment to say that Leo DiCaprio was miscast, although, I also feel that his character, Amsterdam, was out of place in this mid-19th century New York setting.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but feel, as the final credits were rolling, that this movie falls into the same tragic category as `Pearl Harbour'. The time, place and high emotions running in these settings provide a background with endless possibilities for intriguing characters and riveting plots but both, for me, fail miserably to deliver. Similarly with ""Pearl Harbour"", the inclusion of the Amsterdam & Jenny characters and their sickly-sweet romantic tale seems wildly out of place in this violent and crude setting.<br/><br/>
Would not tales of the earlier, on-going battles between Bill the Butcher & 'Priest' Vallon and their respective gangs have made for a more realistic and interesting film in this particular background? Particularly as the wonderful talent of Liam Neeson wouldn't have been so tragically under-utilised (imagine, DD-L and Neeson in a running battle of wills & arms, head-to-head throughout the majority of the film!). I suspect that it is the `money men' of the industry who insist upon including these soppy romantic sub-plots, maybe it is the writer & director themselves, but they only serve to drag down movies in which, they have no place.<br/><br/>An acknowledgement to Jim Broadbent for his convincing portrayal of ""Boss Tweed"" is also well deserved. Along with Day-Lewis, his performance virtually saves the movie.<br/><br/>Apologies to those of you who enjoyed `Pearl Harbour', by the way, but I figured the numbers would be so few, that the damage done would be minimal :-)<br/><br/>Only just makes 7/10 (thanks to Daniel Day-Lewis)."

"tangoyank","Null","0","0","6 July 2003"," One of the worst Best Picture nominees ever
","This movie is a sad failure, as it's obvious how badly Scorsese wanted to tell a story about this time period and how much hard work he put into the details. But the movie ultimately fails because of a very thin story overwhelmed by artifice - and two unfortunate casting choices.<br/><br/>I think it was Scorsese who has said that the majority of a director's job lies in casting the right actors. If that is true, the movie is doomed by the choices of DiCaprio and Diaz in two of the lead roles.<br/><br/>I like Diaz and think she's a charming, effervescent, and sexy screen presence. But she has a very modern appearance, demeanor, and spirit, and she just does not work in this role.<br/><br/>As for DiCaprio, regardless of whatever acting talent he may possess, he cannot overcome his own physicality. DiCaprio has the face and body of a young teenage boy, and although he is getting close to 30 now, his appearance has not aged much since ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape."" He hasn't yet developed an adult man's beard growth and still has a chubby, cherubic face (with a whisker here and there above his lip and on his chin). And although his teenage fans are many, DiCaprio just can't convey true adult masculinity, virility, or sexual tension. His appearance works well in, say, ""Catch Me If You Can,"" where the role is that of a teenager masquerading as an adult.<br/><br/>But in this movie, we are asked to accept him as a tough, vengeful, full-grown man who is able to murder Daniel Day-Lewis's legendary upperclass thug Bill the Butcher. It's so preposterous a notion that the actual act is obscured by smoke in the climactic scene (though we do see an aftermath shot of DiCaprio with a dirty face and scruffy red hair, looking much like Chucky from ""Child's Play""). This is no fault of DiCaprio's, really - it's just a monumental act of miscasting. Just as a reasonable audience could not accept, say, DeNiro as an overweight black woman or Streep as a high school cheerleader, DiCaprio simply does not have the physical appearance to be convincing in this role.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis, however, is not miscast, and gives an amazing performance, although his modern-cliche-sounding Noo Yawk accent was at times distracting and over-the-top. Imagine how different this movie could have been with, say, Colin Farrel or Heath Ledger or Ewan McGregor paired with, perhaps, Kate Winslet or Helena Bonham-Carter.<br/><br/>But what bothered me most about this movie is that, even aside from the casting misfires, I was never able to suspend my disbelief. Everything about the movie seems artificial, even the sets and costumes; I assume they are authentic in appearance but seemed like something out of a Dickens PBS/BBC movie. This movie cost about $100 million, I've read, and the production values do look expensive. But they still didn't seem believable to me. I was always aware, perhaps becuase of the meagerness of the story being told, that I was watching footage shot on a elaborately-constructed Cinecitti backlot.<br/><br/>There wasn't a single frame of this movie in which I was not acutely aware that these were actors in costumes, on sets built in Italy, and that Scorsese was standing just off camera telling everyone exactly what they should do.<br/><br/>I suppose this is an interesting, neglected time period in history, and not a bad idea for a movie setting. Yet a setting is not enough - the movie needed a compelling story. All the work and money has gone into these background elements (expensive sets, costumes, actors, and special effects) without having anything very interesting in the story department. The movie would have been much more successful artistically if it had cheap costumes, shabby sets, unknown actors - but with an actual story that could hold our interest."

At times the film is difficult to watch, mostly because of its brutality, but after one viewing I must say that I could not feel for any of the characters, and I must place the blame on the directing for this problem. And something that really bugged me--when Bill the Butcher burns the face of Amsterdam, did you notice that he hardly has any scar?

","Pretty much ignored at the Oscars this year, `Gangs of New York' deserved a bit more of the Academy's attention than it received. Twenty-five years in the making, it was worth the wait as the finished product is quite a good one. This is classic Scorsese given a periodic setting: lowlifes, hellish streets, and crime-filled landscapes. It is also a superb follow-up to Scorsese's last outing- the equally impressive `Bringing out the Dead'.<br/><br/>
Given the technology in the hectic world of today, `Gangs of New York' wouldn't have been pulled off with quite as oomph had it been made 20-25 years ago. Digital effects were very sparse back then, and cardboard studio settings would seem obvious. The recreation of the Five Points is magnificent to say the least. Truly, one of the best works in cinematography, set decoration and art direction to date. But this is too be discarded as a `technically impressive movie' (The Matrix, Star Wars etc.), as the narrative that follows is a strong one that holds up well against the booming shadows of the set pieces. <br/><br/>But the real star here is Martin Scorsese and his mesmerising sleight of hand. Perhaps a bit too gritty and violent, but he runs this show and brings back the vividly hellish, dank New York landscape that know other director can pull-off quite as well. He was the most deserving nominee at the Oscars and by all means should have won. Being from Ireland myself, the accents are hard to judge. I find it ironic how most of the American actors (John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas etc.) were given `Oirish' accents, while most Irish actors (Daniel Day Lewis, Jim Broadbent etc.) were given American accents.<br/><br/>
Some performances are good but others are hard to judge. The lead `average Joe' part goes to Leo DiCaprio. He does the best job with the material he is given, and isn't half-bad, but this probably isn't his finest hour to make the role his own. His accent comes and goes to a very vague effect. The same applies to Cameron Diaz. She gave the part her all, but she's much better at the lighter roles, and the accent is undefined. Daniel Day Lewis' performance is a bit of an enigma. Occasionally good in the operatically menacing role, in others he is just too hammy. He sticks to the `New Yawkish' accent throughout, but that is very hard to comprehend. The Irish accent was much more convincing in all his other films. In fairness, it is a dead-on impression of William Cutting, but simply too farfetched and often over-the-top to have deserved the Oscar. Supporting performances are quite good from the likes of Brendan Gleeson, Jim Broadbent and Henry Thomas. But you get the strong feeling that much of the scenes with John C. Reilly (Magnolia, The Hours) and Cara Seymour (American Psycho, Adaptation) were left on the cutting room floor. <br/><br/>Another flaw is the fact the movie is simply too long. After the `Leo-recovering-in-the-cave' scene it loses much of its momentum. Certainly not one for the squeamish, `Gangs of New York' is still a powerful epic that deserved at least three wins out of the ten Oscar nominations it received (particularly Best Director). Visually impressive but also deep and meaningful, this is a superbly detailed and often under-appreciated picture. My IMDb rating: 7.4/10."

","Gangs of New York- *** and a half Gangs of New York tells a story of revenge, anger, and friendship. Amsterdam Vallon grew in the five points where his father had been murdered by a man that goes by the name of Bill the Butcher( Daniel-Day Lewis).  Many years later he reunites himself with the five points and also a friendship of trust when his face captures Bill the Butcher.  They become friends, but the thought of animosity still ponders in him and still the thought of revenge on Bill.  Amsterdam meets a prig named Jenny(Cameron Diaz).  Once the true identity of Amsterdam is revealed to Bill, a war is unleashed.  As Bill has ruled the city eversince picking on the colors and Irish.  I found that Gangs of New York had showed the vivid colors of scenery of New York, superior acting from Daniel-Day Lewis, and also the gory fight scences.  As it may be one of the most popular films of the year and one my favorites of the year, I still have to tell you this is not one of the great Martin Scorseese pictures such as Goodfellas.  I think this movie is great, but it's not perfect."

","Martin Scorsese offers GANGS OF NEW YORK as an historic picture of New York as a brutal, primitive wasteland, and it's a perfect complement to the elaborate, highly civilized New York city wasteland he so vividly brought to life in AGE OF INNOCENCE.  Scorsese brings his definitive style and deep, personal conviction to both films, elaborately exploring cultural and historic upheavels at intriguing moments in the history of a city which has had a profound place in the artist's body of work.  GANGS is a magnificent production and a superior epic in the sense that it envisions and embodies a relatively unknown period of historic significance and establishes a barbarous and treacherous atmosphere that should stimulate and intrigue inquisitive and intelligent viewers right from the start.  A fine achievement by one of America's best filmmakers."

","I finally got around to seeing this film about 6 months after I had intended to, and unfortunately picked the hottest day of the summer so far to see it. I say unfortunately because every yokel in the Milwaukee metropolitan area decided to take advantage of the budget prices, and of the air conditioning for three hours, so the audience I watched it with generally were not the least bit interested in actually watching the historical drama and weren't afraid to vocalize this.  Loudly.  And repeatedly.  The good news is, apparently the average attention span for a film is 2 hours, so around the 2 hour mark people seemed to leave the theater in droves, and I finally was able to experience the final hour in relative peace.<br/><br/>Having said that, I actually really enjoyed this film.  I have heard complaints of the length, the lack of action, all they do is fight, there's no story, etc. I found it to be not only compelling, but it actually has prompted me to do further research on this time period.  This was a film that Scorcese has been trying to make for a long time, and it is a natural addition to his gallery of films that take place during certain periods of history in New York.  Perhaps I missed something, but I only saw a couple of major fights during the film's three hours, and in answer to the lack of storyline:  Clearly, this was a film not only about the life and times of the Five Points from an historical perspective, but it chose several characters to lead us through this history lesson not through narrative, but as a regular ""life on the street"" type of storytelling.  It is also a classic story of a love/hate relationship between mentor and apprentice as well as a struggle with ones own identity and destiny.<br/><br/>If I had to issue a complaint or two about the film, I agree that the length was a little cumbersome, and Leonardo DiCaprio apparently kept losing and finding his accent with wild abandon, but that is more nitpicky than anything.  For the few faults this film may have contained, the high points certainly made up for them, namely the amazing performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.  I had heard a lot of build up regarding his character over the last several months, and of course he was nominated for an Oscar, but his performance was truly inspired.<br/><br/>I will definitely buy this on DVD when it is released, but will probably wait awhile to watch the film itself again.  However, if Scorcese provides a commentary track, I will be watching that instantly - the man is a genius and once again, he has created a film that solidifies my complete awe of his intelligence and vision.<br/><br/>--Shelly"

This is the experience of watching 'Gangs of New York', and the two fighters are called ""Ambitions"" and ""Flaws.""<br/><br/>The film begins in the Five Points district of 1840s New York amongst a vivid gang war over turf. Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) witnesses the slaying of his father, Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), at the blade of William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and his ""Native"" Americans gang. So what does this son of a dead preacher-man do? Well he gros up, plots revenge by making a name under the wing of the Butcher, becoming like a surrogate son. But will vengeance consume him and turn him into blah blah blah. I'll give you three guesses where this leads and you won't need two of them.<br/><br/>Watch Leo DiCaprio assemble toughs, rake heels, and ne'er do wells to his Irish gang of rapscallions with facial hair that looks to be tweezed! Witness a one-dimensional Leo suck the life out of the film like a black hole! See Leo become the least frightening gangster since Frido.<br/><br/>
Watch the horribly miscast Cameron Diaz play pin-the-tail-on-an-accent!

Admire his stove-top hat and handlebar mustache!<br/><br/>Witness a wonderful supporting cast including John C. Reilly, Jim Broadbent and Brendan Gleeson! Wish that they had more screen time to work with!<br/><br/>Wonder to yourself why in all good graces this film took nearly two years of delays to get out! Speculate away!<br/><br/>'Gangs' has the sharp aroma of a film heavily interfered with by its producers. The whole exercise feels like Scorsese being compromised. 'Gangs' is a meticulous recreation of 1860s New York that often evokes an epic sense of awe. The story has more resonance when it flashes to small yet tasty historical asides, like the dueling fire houses and the Draft Riots. But all of these interesting tidbits get pushed aside for our pedantic revenge storyline with pretty-boy Leo front and center. You know the producers wanted a more commercial storyline, which probably explains why Diaz has anything to do with this. And Leo? He still screams like a girl too.<br/><br/>The script is credited to longtime Scorsese collaborator Jay Cocks, Steven Zallian (Academy award winner for 'Shindler's List') and Kenneth Lonergan (Academy award nominee for 'You Can Count on Me'). So with all these writing credentials, don't you think one of them would realize all of the dumb things going on with the story? The ending is also very anticlimactic and ham-fisted. Just watch as we segue from a graveyard to present day New York, all thanks to the Irish rockers of U2!<br/><br/>I know this much, Day-Lewis needs to stop cobbling shoes and act more often. 'Gangs' is his first visit to the big screen since 1997's 'The Boxer'. He spent part of this hiatus in Italy actually making shoes. I don't know about everyone else but this man has too much talent to only be acting once every five years. Somebody buy his shoes and get him a script, post haste!<br/><br/>Scorsese's 'Gangs of New York' is at times sprawling with entertainment in its historic vision and at other times is infuriating, always dragging behind it a ball and chain called ""stupid revenge story/love story."" I'm sure the film will get plenty of awards and Oscar nods in prominent categories, and this seems like the Academy's familiar plan: ignore a brilliant artist for the majority of their career and then finally reward them late for one of their lesser films. So here's hoping Scorsese wins the Oscar he deserved for 'Raging Bull' and 'Goodfellas'.<br/><br/>An American Tale + Far and Away = Gangs of New York<br/><br/>C+"

As a fan of scorsese's movies, i have always liked his ideas and perception about NewYork city , he seems not considering NYC only as a location of many of his movies , but as a living entity , entity that has dreams,fears and hopes , an entity with past,present and a future, and as we have seen NYC during the seventies and eighties as filmed in his movies , why not take a look at the past of the city?<br/><br/>The movie's opening battle between the irish leaded by Priest Falon(Liam Nesson) and the American natives leaded by Bill the Butcher(Daniel Day Lewis) , the battle scene was one of the most breathtaking moments of the film , it introduced us to NYC in this dark age , with every blood that is shed and every limp that is chopped we become more and more prepared for the incoming viloence throughout the movie , and as the little Di caprio watches his Dad gets killed by the hands of the Butcher he tries to run away but he is captured by the gang's members and sent to a prison like asylum , where he spends 16 years till he is being released , and get back the city to seek revenge agains Bill the Butcher. may leads you<br/><br/>To consider this movie a revenge movie is sort of misjudgement , the revenge story is running alongside the real story , the story of NYC itself , how it was evolved , how it was built on lakes and lakes of fire and blood , and as the movie goes on you you become more and more engaged into what Scorsese is intending to do , the analysing of the present based on the past.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is magnificent in every aspect , great performance that captures you from the very first scene you see him , and that may leads you to miss him during the scenes where he is not present , and i think he should(And must)Have got the Academy award for his performance , and actually he deserve it . Leonardo Di caprio did a good role , although i have seen a better performance from him in (catch me if you can) , but may be the shining of Day Lewis was overwhelming and that may affected his performance. Cameron Diaz was very charming in the her role , and that's an extending for her good performances during the past period like her role in (Vannila Sky).<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese did a very good job , he is a master as usual , and his vision for NYC in the 19 th century was surprising in every sort of the way , and very convincing aslo , you get the messages beyond the movie easily , although it needs some thinking to get the full message , and the rhythm of the movie was good in general , although i think that some parts needed to be faster , but that may be due The carness from Scorsese to build his charachters carefully and accurately , so you can accept the moves of the characters without inquiring why this or that has happened , and that's of cource is an important corner of directing a good movie.<br/><br/>Gangs of NewYork may not be the best movie directed by Scorsese , but sure it's one of the best in his career and one of the best movies of 2002 or 2003 (depends on the release date in your country) ."

"Liljan-2","7","0","0","15 April 2003"," Day-Lewis impressive, DiCaprio less so
","It is a well known fact that there is a peculiar fascination for the outlaws of American history; in the US as well as the rest of the world. One of the results of this are the countless movies that deal with the activities of people like Al Capone and the gunslingers of the Old West. Until now, one of the aspects of criminal history in America that have not been commercialised to such an extent is the activities of the gangsters of 19th century New York. This is the subject of Martin Scorsese's movie 'Gangs of New York'.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the characters Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis). Amsterdam is the son of 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson), a gang leader who was killed by Bill when Amsterdam was still a child. After 'Priest's' death, Amsterdam spent his remaining childhood in a reform school, but now he has returned to take vengeance on Bill, who is blissfully unaware that the young man he takes under his wing is in fact the son of his old antagonist.<br/><br/>The racial tensions in 19th century New York are an important element in the story, as 'Priest' Vallon's old gang, called the 'Dead Rabbits', consists of Irish immigrants whereas Bill's gang  the 'Native Americans'  consists of people who are born in the US and as such consider themselves to have a birthright to that land. Another prominent feature is the division between the rich and the poor, and the class-related resentment in early New York. While I cannot vouch for the historical accuracy of the descriptions of life in New York during this era, I nevertheless found it interesting to see these subjects dealt with in the movie. Having said this, one must of course bear in mind that this is an action movie loosely based on historical events, not unlike 'Braveheart', for example. It does not pretend to be high brow entertainment and should not be judged by such criteria.<br/><br/>I have to say that the one actor that truly stands out in this movie is Daniel Day-Lewis. He is the classic movie villain, deranged and bad to the bone as only movie villains can be. One of the details about his performance that has stuck in my mind is the scene where he throws knives at his terrified protégée Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) on a theater stage; before his knife throwing act he makes a little speech to his audience, and I remember his voice twitching during the speech in a peculiar way which, given the nature of the situation, reinforces the impression that we are truly dealing with a man insane. Outstanding! <br/><br/>I didn't find Leonardo DiCaprio quite as impressive, however. There is in my opinion something boyish and immature about that actor's appearance and manners which rarely corresponds with the parts he gets to play, and it makes him look particularly unconvincing as a tough and hardy New York gangster. Cameron Diaz, finally, does an apt performance as Jenny Everdeane, but somehow I feel that she is too talented an actress for such a marginal part. She may not be the most well respected actress under the sun, but having seen her excellent performance in ""Being John Malkovich"" I would say that she has more talent and potential than many people give her credit for.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I give this movie a seven out of ten, mainly because of the interesting subject matter and the brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis."

","Gangs of New York {GONY} is an amazing historical rare gem. Mr. Scorsese has out done himself with this one. A fascinating journey of New York City in 1863. The civil war, the draft riots, the gangs, the violence, the crime, the culture, the politics, the city, and everything in between. Another outstanding directing accomplishment by Mr. Scorsese, with the passion a lot of directors only dream about. No matter what you say about Scorsese or about his directing, you can't knock his passion for filmmaking. The film starts in 1846 with a fight over the five points between the Natives and the Irishmen. The five points is five streets that come together in lower Manhattan. During the fight the leader of the Irishmen, Priest Vallon {Liam Neeson}, gets killed by William Bill The Butcher' Cutting {Daniel Day-Lewis}. During the fighting the son of the Priest, Amsterdam Vallon {Leonardo DiCaprio}, sees his father die. He is then put into a boy home for seventeen years. The film fast forwards through those seventeen years and picks up in 1863. The boy has become a man in his middle twenties and wants to revenge is father's death by taking the life of the man that took his father's. He finds it hard to kill the man that killed his father as he takes a liking to Bill The Butcher, and vise versa. The film is rich in history and beauty. The only thing that I do not like about the film is the character Jenny Everdeane {Cameron Diaz}. There is no reason for her part in the film. But I guess Hollywood needs that key female role. Only during her parts does the film drag. She slows it down too much. Not because of Diaz herself, just her role. Nothing really important happens during her time on the screen. There are a couple of scenes with her that are entertaining. But that's only because of the written, directing, and the other actors, not because of her. They could have had any actress for those scenes. All they had to do is cut most of the scenes out and keep the entertaining ones. All she does is keep some hostility between Vallon and The Butcher, which is important. But any whore can do that, that's what women do. The biggest reason I don't give GONY four stars and a 10/10 is because of the Jenny character. I already saw the film three times in the theater, so I don't think one more viewing would change my mind about the character. But I won't know until I view it again. The film has everything down to a science, from the set direction, costume design, and cinematography, its all fantastic. I give Gangs of New York * * * ½ {out of four stars} & a 9/10."

","Many ideas and many ideals do not a good film make. And after seeing this movie I'm even more convinced of that. Here, a supposed labor of love and a project that has been dragging over more than 20 years presents itself like just one more movie and not the great Martin Scorsese return we all expected. I saw this after the oscar failure, and the question ""why?"" crossed my mind, when he had a great opportunity to receive that much wanted Best Director award. But when I saw this, I understood that the academy hasn't lost its marbles after all. In the middle of a great idea - the handling of a little known period of New York history - what comes out is not the awe of the gigantic production values, or the painful recognition that, indeed, the american society we know today WAS born in the streets. What comes out is the flaws that the movie makes so pivotal and doesn't suceed in hiding. Flaws like the much confusing structure of the story, that doesn't seem at all balanced, or that love story that turns out cold and uninspiring. Of course, the best thing about the movie is the addictive performance of Daniel Day Lewis, that steals all of the many scenes where he's in, and makes you want to see more of him by the end, and there are few moments where the power of the overall idea that New York has a dramatic background is well shown. But the sensation of ending up with nothing new is much more overwhelming than the cinematic experience, and the bad taste on your mouth becomes more and more intense, as the overlength starts picking on you.

"jransom","Null","0","0","5 April 2003"," A strong look at the politics of the era with only one major oversight
","I haven't seen Polanski's The Pianist yet, but Adrien Brody had better have given a truly stellar performance to beat out Daniel Day-Lewis at the Oscars.  I would go as far to say, Day-Lewis' portrayal of the proud warrior Bill the Butcher was the strongest aspect of the film.  He spits out lines like, ""I'll paint Paradise Square with his blood...two coats"" with a penetrating ferocity matched in recent years perhaps only by Christopher Walken.  Even when he recites bad quips like, ""that's the minority vote"" while pointing to an Irish victim of his, he gives the lines a hellish intensity. As for the other performances, they are good all around, but nowhere near as impressive as Day-Lewis.  DiCaprio wisely tones down the Irish accent that could have easily become gimmicky and manages to glower at the camera with enough animosity to at least hold his own beside Day-Lewis if not actually compare.  The sets were lavish and startlingly realistic and the movie covers more political ground than I thought possible in its running time of 166 minutes while still keeping a strong grasp on its principle characters. <br/><br/>Scorsese shows even the ugliest aspects of the times with a brutal honesty that is likely to endear the film to more serious viewers.  It is because of this, that I found the movie's lack of a major black character particularly problematic.  It is not that Scorsese overlooks the racial tensions of the era.  In fact, he shows with horrific detail what becomes of the unfortunate blacks in New York City when the immigrants, who have been drafted to fight for emancipation, turn into violent lynch mobs.  Because Scorsese is willing to put these events on screen it would seem fair for him to include the trials and tribulations of a major black character. Alas, all we recieve is Jimmy Spoils, a token black character who essentially stands around and says approximately six lines.  Scorsese tries to cover up this oversight with a late scene in which Amsterdam (DiCaprio) sees Jimmy a final time and begins to understand the tragedy of the riots. But, we can only sympathize with Jimmy on the shallow level of melodrama, because we know virtually nothing about him. Another smaller concern of mine was Scorsese's choice of modern rock music for the opening fight scene between the Native Americans and Dead Rabbits gangs.  Had he continued with modern music for the rest of the film, he would have had something.  Something odd and unsettling perhaps, but at least something.  But Scorcese opts to cut back to archaic flutes, drums, and orchestratic music after the disconcerting start.  Better yet, he could have left the fight music out entirely and selected a heavy percussion set instead. The last thing I would like to mention is Scorsese's over-zealous use of extraneous flashbacks to link the characters to their earlier incarnations of Dead Rabbits.  I felt that these were unnecessary since all but the least-conscious of film-goers can recognize the likes of John C. Reilly (Boogie Nights, Magnolia) and Brenden Gleeson(The General).  Overall, Scorsese deals out a hard dose of a side of history that has been overlooked for far too long.  It's just sad that he did not take the time for one more script revision that would supply Jimmy Spoils with meaningful screen time."

","Martin Scorsese's pet labour of love, a project he'd been trying to set up for nearly a quarter of a century, finally reaches the screen after tales of a turbulent year-long production and rumours of constant arguments with producer and Miramax head Harvey Weinstein, namely over its length (Scorsese's first cut came in at over three and a half hours). The end result, however, is more than worth the wait, since Scorsese, shooting in a massive specially-constructed set in Cinecittá, has really given it his all and comes out with one of his most striking and powerful films, even if it's a bit too early to say if it's his best. Sharing the recurrent theme of people caught up in the inexorable march of a history whose symptoms and symbols they are, the film is set against the little-known New York urban riots of the mid-1850s, when the city's slums, an explosive ethnic mix of immigrants from all over the world and resentful first-generation Americans, rose against the tony uptown over the newly-passed conscription law of compulsory military service in the Civil War, setting up an urban civil war of its own. Against this heated political backdrop Scorsese plays out the story of the revenge of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo di Caprio), son of an Irish immigrant gangleader, on Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), a first-generation nationalist and head of the Natives gang who killed his father on a gang fight. The tensions between Vallon and Cutting are used as metaphors of the havoc around them but also of their own specific codes of honour - a son without a father, looking for one in the man who killed his own, but also a father without a son looking for someone to call a son, both of them willing to sacrifice what they hold as sacred to ensure the survival of the bloodline. Breathtakingly directed by Scorsese in a sweeping, operatic flow, ""Gangs of New York"" is an old-fashioned political epic that seems strangely attuned to our days and confirms Scorsese as the quintessential American director of his generation and one of the few able to harness material of this scope and size into a film so genuinely impressive."

REVIEW: Compelling. That is one word that you could use to describe Martin Scorsese's epic film, ""Gangs of New York"". Other words you could use are mesmerizing, brilliant and all those other fancy words that critics like to use on such Oscar nominated films. But this time, these words are appropriate and well deserved. <br/><br/>""Gangs of New York,"" which was originally conceived back in 1978, stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day Lewis, who is absolutely brilliant. Ahh, there's that word again! But yet, it is true. Daniel Day-Lewis' performance of Bill ""The Butcher"" is one of the most amazing performances in quite sometime. And though, Lewis steals every scene he's in, the supporting cast is also quite effective. Most notably, Jim Broadbent as William Tweed, Cameron Diaz as Jenny, and Liam Neeson is excellent in his brief turn as Priest Vallon. But don't forget the meticulous screenplay, the detailed set designs and the impeccable direction of Martin Scorsese, who surprisingly has yet to win a Best Director Oscar. However, I will have my fingers crossed for him (and Daniel Day-Lewis) on March 23rd. <br/><br/>OVERALL: Dust off a spot next to ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"" and make room for ""Gangs of New York"". ***1/2 (out of 4 stars)"

","small spoilers<br/><br/>The gripping opening scene promises what looks like an epic, starting right at the beginning with narration in the first person. The father-and-son exchange is another hallmark for great things to come. Then comes the the marshalling of weapons which, in a way, is not unlike the final battle scene in Aliens (the second one, with an ""s""), where Sigourney Weaver assembles hardware from the amazing arsenal for her showdown. The intensity is almost suffocating. The actual battle is extremely well crafted by Scorsese, and ends quite brilliantly. There is no villain. Such killing as we see is simply the course of nature, with no malice, the way you would kill a wild beast that is about to devour you, as explained by Caesar in Shaw's Crasar and Cleopatra. In a war on survival of the fittest, you can still honour your enemy after you have killed him.<br/><br/>With such an opening, a lofty epic seems in sight.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, however, the Hollywood formula and predictability becomes more and more evident. We begin to see that Gangs of New York is more of a melodrama than an epic. It deals with raw passions, with little subtleties or intricacies of more complex human feelings. Not that there is anything terribly wrong with raw passions, but the story is also lacking in dimensions and breadth. Indeed, there's a bit of history thrown in, but the Civil War and the dawn of the human rights movement serve only as a vague backdrop. As the title aptly conveys, this is a story about gangs in Now York, no less, but certainly not much more. Scorsese tells it passionately, as his dedication and salute to the city. His visions of New York, some rather dark, is revealed to us in his brilliant mise-en-scene. We get a very entertaining film, but not quite an epic in the league of Braveheart.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is no Christy Brown here, but the fictional (I think)William Cutting, alias Bill the Butcher, who vows to drive every single Irish immigrant off his turf. Cutting's relationship with Amsterdam Vallon, his favorite apprentice but also (unkown to him) son of a man he killed in battle, could have been made more watchable. However, in order to capitalize on the explosiveness of his character, any shades of subtlety had to be sacrificed. DiCarprio's challenge of playing Vallon, a character rougher than most he has attempted hitherto, has been reasonably well met. An even gutsier treament would be to have him severely disfigured by Cutting when his identity is revealed. Cameron Diaz has demonstrated elsewhere that she is up to challenges beyond the glamorous roles. A good example is Being John Malkovich, in which she is almost unrecognizable. Here, however, she is back to a more familiar role which she handles with ease, but in which she has no opportunity to shine.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm sure most of the audience would notice the very final vision in the film, the World Trade Centre, and grasp the meaning."

","After years in the making, this story of history, honor, revenge and violence will one day be labeled a Hollywood classic that everyone must respect enough to sit down to at least once. Martin Scorsese's tale of a life during the days when violence was a way of living in the streets of New York is simply overwhelming to the human eye. By setting the scene beautifully with every perfection in detail we successfully witness the birth of a city and the horrors that took over it during a period of struggling conflicts between the Native Americans and the Irish immigrants. The film follows young Amsterdam Vallon (played successfully by Leonardo Dicaprio) as he re-enters the underground world of New York City to revenge the death of his Father, who once stood up to the violent hatred of the Irish immigrants as the leader of the `Dead Rabbits' gang. The quest for revenge leads him to the hands of the man who runs the underground circuit nicknamed `The Butcher' magnificently played by Daniel Day-Lewis. With a lengthy time run, this film delivers a very complex reality in the world of the politics, crime lords, thieves and the one man who stands in between all of them. This is a cinematic piece with extreme desire to stay true to the historic events that once occurred, and has posh touches of Hollywood glamour that makes is all the more entertaining. What I couldn't stop thinking about was how many different ways the film could have been approached and maybe the only problem with what it is, could be that the director tried to hard to make it everything, when it could have focused more on either the depiction of violence in the old Gang Wars, the political issue's the people trying to run the country had to deal with or either just focusing in the way of life these citizens were unwillingly forced to deal with. Instead the film contained all of the above, successfully and without fail. But I find it hard to believe that everyone who has seen the film didn't want something a little more to suit there own personal satisfaction, be it a tale of violence, a story of revenge and anger, or simply a historical piece of truth. The film has it all and has endless opportunities for the audience's satisfaction, there isn't a soul around who will not find something they love about this overwhelming Hollywood movie."
"intuitive7","Null","0","0","13 March 2003"," Daniel Day Lewis the ONLY reason, and reason enough...
","A film of Shakespearean proportions and ambitions. Unfortunately Shakespeare didn't write or direct it. And it shows.<br/><br/>That said, Daniel Day Lewis is ASTOUNDING as Bill Cutting and worth enduring all GONY's weaknesses for. I have rarely seen such an outrageous character played with such truth, and that includes any of DeNiro's work with Scorsese. DeNiro's Jake LaMotta is a great performance, but LaMotta's not an outrageous character, so it's easier to locate and act LaMotta's truth. Travis Bickle... still not as outrageous. Cutting is a character of Falstaffian size and Day Lewis tackles him full on for three hours with boundless Cagney-like energy. DDL is THE actor to beat on March 23rd.<br/><br/>
My cineaste friends all wonder what this film would have been without Day Lewis, and we conclude not much. A few sparks from DiCaprio and Diaz, but nothing special. Fabulous production design, good editing by Thelma S. as usual, but about as much structure as Bringing Out the Dead, which is to say, hardly any. (Where's Paul Schrader when you need him?) Scale, sets, character count and budget do not an epic make. Scorsese is simply not an epic director and probably never will be. Scorsese is without peer when he directs what he knows. No one else could create a Good Fellas. But Age of Innocence should have been a warning; stay away from history. House of Mirth is much better Wharton. Marty is simply not a David Lean, he's not a Spielberg, not even a Polanski (my vote for Best Director this Academy season). Maybe Harvey and Bob W. knew this and it's why they blanched when the GONY budget kept balloooooning.<br/><br/>This is a hugely distorted history by a man with one theme on his mind - the workings of force, intimidation and mob dynamics on a struggling underclass - and that theme is an important nail to hammer over and over. Scorsese knows it New York style better than anyone - for OUR era, culled from his own childhood. But apply the Scorsese touch a century and a half earlier and you wind up with melodrama, and that's what this inauthentic ""epic"" is. Except for Day Lewis, I'd rather watch ""Who's That Knocking"" again than this. Or Michael Mann's Insider, which has compelling story with its grit, and no need for axe and cleaver mayhem (see Braveheart for that).<br/><br/>
If you're an acting fan, you'll be drawn into GONY again and again if you run across it on cable - thanks to Day Lewis. If you're a Soprano's fan, you can thank Martin Scorsese, because without him, there would be no Tony Soprano. But all that notwithstanding, buy or rent Marty's best work - Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Good Fellas, Cape Fear, etc  - not this shapeless shantytown opera."

"bazthegreat","Null","0","0","11 March 2003"," Confronting drama that's definitely worth it!
","With Gangs of New York, I believe Scorsese wanted to make a confronting drama with enough realism to shock and hopefully even educate the audience. It is a movie you have to think long and hard about, and so yes, it can be a difficult film to follow. However, if you give the movie your full concentration, it's definitely worth it.<br/><br/>To me, realism was what Gangs of New York was all about. Maybe I'm wrong - maybe Scorsese didn't make a film that was entirely historically accurate. I can't say because I don't know the history of that time. However, from what I've read about his passion for this project, I would like to think the story was set in an accurate historical setting.<br/><br/>The cinematography was amazing, and the set design breath taking. I read that Scorsese insisted that huge sets be built, rather than relying on the ever increasing popularity of digital sets. I admired him for achieving such a realistic setting. In fact, in several scenes, I fully felt like I was right there in New York slumming it on the streets of Five Points. It was a chilling experience, that's for sure! But also a rather exhilerating one, as it helped me get involved with the story and feel more for the characters.<br/><br/>The violence - yes, there was a lot of blood and gore in this film. And it's the violence that seems to have annoyed many people. But again, I think the violence contributed to the realism Scorsese was trying to convey. Back then, New York really was that violent, and the people on the streets were exposed to it every day. I believe that since Scorsese wanted the audience to fully realise what it was like on the streets of New York, then this is what we needed to see. It takes a brave director to shed blood so openly onscreen, and I commend Scorsese for not attempting to make it less gorish than it really was.<br/><br/>The acting was superb - I couldn't fault anyone. Daniel Day Lewis certainly stood out as Bill the Butcher and gave a masterfully chilling performance. I also liked the way Cameron Diaz portrayed her character. It could have been a kitsch role, but Diaz gave Jenny depth and compassion, which made her all the more believeable and likeable. I am glad the character of Jenny was included to show life in New York from a female perspective, and what the women of that time had to go through as men behaved crazily around them.<br/><br/>Finally, I'm happy to say that Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Amsterdam has given me even more faith in his acting ability. After seeing his great performance in Catch Me If You Can, I was expecting a brilliant role in Gangs of New York, and that's exactly what I got. I am now very confident that Leonardo will make a perfect Alexander in Baz Luhrmann's upcoming epic, Alexander the Great."

"tjowen","Null","0","0","9 March 2003"," Very Good - Up to a Point
","I have never supported violence on the screen for its own sake.  Any film should tell the story first and any violence should be a mere a by-product of that story.  With so much word of mouth suggesting that the movie is an orgy of fighting and clashing gangs it must be infuriating for the films marketers when they advise that it may be anything else, therefore I put any preconceived notions aside when watching and found it to be quite an enjoyable movie  up to a point.<br/><br/>The basic plot involves Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) coming to the streets of New York to avenge the death of his father at the hands of Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) sixteen years earlier.  Bill doesn't recognise Amsterdam, who manages to worm his way into his life purporting to be a good ally for Bills street gangs, while all the time figuring out how, and when, he wants to reveal his identity and get his revenge.  The movie is set at the time when conscription into the army for the civil war first rears its ugly head.<br/><br/>The conscription issue would seemingly remain nothing more than a historical footnote until the story of Amsterdam and Bill is unexpectedly forgotten in the `bigger' picture and the movie concentrates on the riots that plagued the area in this era.  And suddenly I was confused.  Not because of the plot, it isn't that difficult to follow, but Scorsese had spent so long trying to create the tension between Amsterdam and Bill and appeared to either forget about it, or get bored with it and move onto something new  it just didn't make sense.  Perhaps the point was supposed to be that the struggles of individual men are nothing compared with the larger issues, perhaps it was there because it was in the book, perhaps Scorsese was trying to give us a history lesson, perhaps it was an excuse for more violence? Basically there seemed to be no clear point in it being there and since the movie was too long anyway (possibly to make it qualify for being the `epic' the film makers so desperately seemed to have wanted) it could have been cut entirely and would have made the film a more manageable length.  Compared to something like Titanic, where the story of Jack and Rose was the main bulk, but suddenly the ship began to sink (and if you think that's a spoiler, you really need to attend more history lessons)  at least in that instance the main storyline continued to unfold with the sinking lending new opportunities for plot-points, rather than James Cameron saying `let's forget about them for half an hour and do a bit of directorial self-indulgence'.  Maybe I've laboured the point a little but if there was one thing that let the movie down for me, this was definitely it.<br/><br/>For the first three quarters, where Bill and Amsterdam are actually concerned in the movie, I was rather enjoying myself.  The violence was well shot, brilliantly choreographed and seemed to support the story rather than try to replace it (with the above exception), the cinematography second to none and aside from a few dodgy bits of editing I had few complaints aside from the occasional odd accent.  But again, where the conscription was utterly superfluous, so was Cameron Diaz as the wily Jenny Everdeane.  It's no comment on her acting, which was okay, but she didn't really need to be there unless to allow boyfriends to convince their girlfriends to come along because there's a sniff of a love story too.  Jim Broadbent was memorable as most of the individual performances were, but it wasn't enough to rescue the film from what it tried to be - but ultimately tried too hard."

","An immigrants' nation - this is the idea of America, right? Ever since the Mayflower America has been made of and by immigrants. Isn't it supercilious to speak of oneself as a native American when the real natives had been killed by one's own ancestors? This is what makes Gangs of NY a real and true American epic movie, dealing with exactly this illogical notion and the hatred and violence resulting of it. Who has the right to say what matters, who is in charge and how solve the problems? The idea of the script is brilliant - Cameron Diaz as the one standing between protagonist and antagonist who themselves represent the ""old"" and the ""new"" order and understanding both. Day-Lewis as the father figure who is amiable, but violent and excessive. DiCaprio as the lost son fighting against injustice and corruption, less violent but angry in the same degree. The topic is modern and timeless at the same time. The ending of this epic is a compromise: there still is a mightier force that kills what is a threat to humanity - and this seems also bad and brutal because its representative is a human being, too, after all. And the representative of the ""new"" order is heavily injured and seems desillusioned because he has realized that he cannot fight the mightier who hold the real power (money). This is the philosophic dimension of the movie which I like most. There is also the brilliant photography, the exact editing (as always by Thelma Schoonmaker), the impressive acting (mostly by Day-Lewis)  and - a rather unnerving soundtrack. The latter really annoyed me because the Irish music did not sound Irish at all. It doesn't really matter. BUT: Congratulations to an all-time great, Mr Scorsese!"

","Few movies begin as well as Gangs of New York' does. Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson), watched by his young son, girds himself for battle, gathering about him a barbaric, rag-tag band of Irish immigrants as he walks through fire-lit tunnels and chaotic halls, then out into the still whiteness of an 1846 winter's day in New York's Five Points district. Out in the square he is met by his rival William Bill the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), who heads the Nativists, an American-born Protestant gang. Then, with all the ceremony of Homeric battles, the gangs go to war.<br/><br/>Sixteen years later Vallon's son, now calling himself Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to Five Points where he seeks to re-establish himself. As an awesome aerial shot makes clear, Five Points is the grimy, crime-riddled heart of New York, which Amsterdam describes as less of a city than a furnace, or a furnace in which a city might one day be forged.'  Here he meets the lovely Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz), a thief and a con-artist, and is taken under the wing of the man he has come to kill, Bill the Butcher himself.<br/><br/>When he meets Amsterdam the Butcher introduces himself as New York' and indeed his character towers over both Five Points and the movie. Orator, crimelord, father-figure, racist, patriot, sadist, warrior, showman, Day-Lewis rolls them up into one unforgettable moustached tyrant. It is a magnificent performance. Next to it, DiCaprio's Amsterdam is inevitably a bit pale, but he still does well. Do not imagine that this is a replay of Titanic's charming pretty-boy  Amsterdam is, like the movie itself, angry, violent, conflicted and charismatic. Diaz is unconvincing but the rest of the cast bring to life the vivid assortment of crooks, whores, corrupt policemen and underhanded politicians who fill the movie.<br/><br/>Like all serious dramas dominated by larger-than-life characters like these, Gangs of New York' is often in danger of getting overblown and sometimes becomes so. Though it is packed with great scenes, like when three different men pray to the same god, each claiming his power for their own, or a long tracking shot showing Irish immigrants arriving in the harbour, becoming citizens, being signed up to fight the Civil War and boarding a ship that is unloading coffins, Gangs' does begin to drag after a gripping scene at the anniversary party of the 1846 battle. A long film, it does end strongly though not with the power it promised to have. So it is not one of director Martin Scorscese's greatest films but it is still outstanding, a dirty, gory, intense and beautifully realised epic. It does also have some depth: like many of his other films, such as Mean Streets', Taxi Driver' or Goodfellas', Gangs of New York' shows Scorscese's loving and loathing vision of his home and how in that city, as in the rest of the nation, blood, crime and hatred were, are and will remain an integral part of America. In the times we live in it is a theme worth thinking about.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I was disappointed with this film. Although I understood it would be violent, I wasn't prepared for the amount of gore. I was not impressed with Diaz's accent, which resembled Kevin Costner's accent in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves. Is she Irish, or is she American? Daniel Day Lewis has received a well deserved Oscar nod, as the sympathetic villain, Bill the Butcher. He is someone you definitely love to hate. As for DiCaprio, I was again unimpressed with his acting. I don't know if he'll ever be as good as he was as Arnie Grape, in What's Eating Gilbert Grape. I give this film 2 1/2 stars out of 4."

","""Gangs of New York"" is a great film, dominated by Scorsese's style and contains an in-your-face quality that few other films have. A huge influencing factor in this movie is the ability of Daniel Day-Lewis to make his character, Bill Cutting, one of the great villains - full of menace at every turn, yet intelligent, determined and strangely rational. Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting could have easily been a vaudevillian bad guy, moustache twirling and all, but Mr Day-Lewis gives him qualities that make him the true character center of this film.<br/><br/>Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed is also worth mentioning. Tweed's political manipulations are entertaining to watch and provide an extra dimension to ""Gangs..."". Of the main actors, DiCaprio and Diaz are sufficient in what they do, but ""Gangs..."" suffers from their unneeded relationship scenes. The true focus of this film is the city of New York itself and its impact on those who lived in its boundries during its formation - Scorsese's love of NYC comes clearly across on the big screen, along with his willingness to look at the bad sections along with the good.<br/><br/>Another reviewer compared the fight scenes in this movie to those from ""LOTR: The Two Towers"". I found I was much more involved in the brutal gang fights of ""Gangs..."" than I ever was in the massed battles of ""LOTR:TTT"". Those who have a low tolerance for violence may find ""Gangs..."" a bit graphic, but what did you expect from a Scorsese film?<br/><br/>It should be said that ""Gangs..."" is more american folklore than american history. Certainly the major events in the film occurred, with many of the attitudes of the film reflecting the attitudes and lifestyle of the time, but ""Gangs..."" certainly isn't a history lesson. Even the book it draws so much material from is considered a suspect historical source, written by a journalist who recorded the exaggerations of urban tales. That said, it doesn't diminish ""Gangs..."" impact at all. Scorsese always loves doing things that are larger than life on the big screen and ""Gangs..."" is no different.<br/><br/>""Gangs..."" major failing is it's ending. I felt a bit dismayed that such an epic film resorted to a fairly unsatisfactory conclusion that was almost completely separate to what had been driving the rest of the narrative. All in all, this is a small point - ""Gangs of New York"" is a powerful film that overcomes a few flaws in its portrayal of some great american folklore."
"harunmushod","6","0","0","3 March 2003"," Looks great but ultimately disappointing.
","On the plus side: Daniel Day Lewis is amazing as Bill the Butcher; DiCaprio is better than expected as Amsterdam; Jim Broadbent and Brendan Gleeson are also outstanding. The look of the film is great, and the fight scenes that punctuate the film gruesome and exciting. <br/><br/>On the downside: The story was slow and clunking and it's a shame that Weinstein couldn't persuade Scorsese to trim the film more. The exposition is heavy handed. For example we really didn't need to see any of the flashbacks and there are some scenes where DiCaprio, in particular, either in character or in the voice over, feels it necessary to explain bits of the film's history. The screenwriters have obviously researched in depth (or got it out of Astbury's source book) but then kept all the research in the film even when it didn't necessarily move the story along. The symbolism was also heavy handed. That scenes with Priest Vallon's razor. All of that could have been cut.  John Reilly's character and accent were poor. Finally, there was no point to Diaz's character and, besides, she was wrong for the part. One suspects that she was foisted on Scorsese to increase box office and because there was a need to have a major female character in the story. I can't help thinking that the material would have been better served by a writer like Nicholas Pileggi and a more episodic approach as in Scorsese's and Pileggi's Goodfellas and Casino.  <br/><br/>For what it's worth, the person I went to see it with disagrees totally with all my negative points, and it was interesting enough for me to want to read the book."

","Leonardo DiCaprio is great as Amsterdam Vallon, but Daniel Day Lewis steals the film with his Oscar-nominated role as William The Butcher.  His explosive temper and hesitancy to kill an opponent who annoys him brings back memories of Joe Pesci's acclaimed role in Goodfellas.

","OK so I'm lame, I finally made it to the theater to see this film.<br/><br/>I was amazed. Scorcese pulls few punches in this historical epic. Daniel Day Lewis gave a truly Oscar worthy performance. I could almost imagine Scorcese wishing he could cast a younger Robert DeNiro (but even he would not have improved on DDL's work)<br/><br/>While I was watching the film I found myself thinking that, were I a history teacher,  this film would be required viewing for my students. Of course, without historical perspective, it would be a confusing mess. I had the fortune of just finishing John C. Waugh's excellent ""Reelecting Lincoln: The Battle for the 1864 Presidency"". {I recommend this book to anyone interested in our nation and the Civil War.}  This film takes place in 1864. So I was chock full of historical perspective. I nearly found myself giddy.<br/><br/>
When the character Horace Greeley was mentioned I knew what his views were on Lincoln, the Civil War, the Irish and slavery. I felt like I was almost ""in"" on this film. <br/><br/>Scorcese rightly avoids the Hollywood trap of trying to simply blame the situation on one people, one party or one ethnic group. Instead, he has more than enough blame and scorn to cast about so all are equally stung. This reflects the reality of that historical period.  <br/><br/>Let's talk about DiCaprio. I was astonished how good he was in ""Catch Me If You Can"". This film kicks it up a notch to use the parlance of our times. He was very, very good and I feel  he was snubbed by the Academy.<br/><br/>
Cameron Diaz. When I first saw her gorgeous face on the screen, I thought ""There goes my suspension of disbelief."" In a movie where few people looked attractive at least to modern jaded eyes, she was radiant. I have to be honest. She gave her best performance to date in this film and it was one she can be proud of. John C. Reilly was his usual excellent self. Brendan Gleeson and Liam Neeson were superb in small but important roles. Jim Broadbent was so damn good I forgot he was acting and just thought of him as William ""Boss"" Tweed. <br/><br/>But even with all these star performances, Scorcese is the real star of the show. He manages to bring real emotion to scenes with rhythm and composition and musical choices.  He successfully pulls off with scenes that I just don't see other directors even attempting. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet (and I think I must be the last) hurry and catch it on the big screen. Take it from me you'll be glad you did."

Daniel Day-Lewis is riveting as Bill the Butcher, who pretty much runs the entire show.  Everything that happens is filtered through Bill's eye (the fake one) and what he says goes.  DiCaprio is Amsterdam, who gives an understated performance, and more power to him.  He knows Daniel is the better actor and has the better part in the movie. They can't BOTH be larger than life, so Leo wisely lets his co-star run with it.  Ditto Cameron Diaz, and the rest of the cast.  <br/><br/>Kudos to Marty for getting it all right.

","Firstly, I came out of the movie theater somewhat disturbed.<br/><br/>The settings and colors of the movie were pretty good. I liked that. What disturbed me most was the editing - the worst I have ever seen. Continuity errors on end - and not just visible for the movie buff but the ""ordinary"" viewer as well! (I heard people in the theater go ""What the...?!"", ""What was that?!"" and so forth). The scene at the harbor was re-shot (where Diaz' and DiCaprio's character get ""closer"") and was the best example. I can't image that the original footage was worse.<br/><br/>DiCaprio was playing one facial expression throughout the entire movie. Diaz did the best she could on her part, but in my opinion was miscast. The rest - was there. But that was it. Not that they acted badly or anything. They couldn't have, because they simply weren't given the chance to even act! Only Daniel Day-Lewis was outstanding! I felt his New York accent became better as the movie went on (considering him being English and the difficult accent he had to ""fake""). And in the end he was my favorite character in the plot!<br/><br/>The length of the movie wasn't a concern for me. I don't mind spending time in the theater - as long as the movie is good. Roger Ebert once said a good movie makes you care about the characters. Here, I couldn't have cared less about anyone except the bad guy! To me Scorsese failed to develop _anything_ within the 166 minutes of this piece.<br/><br/>I usually watch the end-credits entirely. This time i walked out 10 seconds after they started. I dunno who is to blame for them - but he should get back to rethinking his approch to his work.<br/><br/>For the story: I'm European and didn't know anything about the 1860s in New York. Allegedly it was, more or less, based on true events. I can't verify that but it was interesting to me to see a different view of that era. I liked that.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, without good acting and even less good editing I find this movie way overrated.<br/><br/>I did keep one favorite quote, though. When DiCaprio's character returned to Five Points he asked a pedestrian for a match: ""Got any timber?"" I've never heard that expression before and it stuck :-)"

I mean it has almost everything you would associate with a good movie, an excellent cast, a wonderful director and a epic length. But alas I came out of the theatre feeling empty and almost cheated of my money.<br/><br/>You start with an interesting period of history that most people are not well versed in, put a good old revenge story in, build it up to a strong climax and destroy it all with a chaotic final act that negates everything that has come before.<br/><br/>If only Scorsese had cut off everything that came after the Cameron Diaz / Daniel Day Lewis knife-throwing scene and rebuilt the movie with a decent ending this movie might go down as one of the best films ever made, but unfortunately it wont, the fact that is has been nominated for Best Picture and Best Director show how far the Oscars have fallen in awarding not excellence but rewarding strong marketing campaigns.<br/><br/>Avoiding the pettiness that is picking out the disappearing/reappearing accents and scars, I would award this 3/5 primarily for the first two acts when sadly if it had followed through it could have been a 5/5<br/><br/>3/5 on the watched far too many movies scale."

","I'll get the movie's few detractions out of the way first: it is long, Cameron Diaz should not have been cast, DiCaprio's performance was a bit uneven and those seeking historical accuracy should look elsewhere.<br/><br/>That said, Gangs of New York is a magnificent film.  It begins in the mid-1800's with a fight in the 5 Points section of New York between the the ""American natives"" (bitterly ironic considering they got the land from the Indians) and the largely Irish gangs of foreigners.  Under the command of Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis), the natives emerge triumphant.  The leader of the opposition, Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) is slain before his son Amsterdam's (Leonardo DiCaprio) eyes.  Amsterdam goes into a 16 year exile, only to return and work as a theif for the all-powerful Butcher. Cameron Diaz is thrown into the mix as a fellow thief/love interest and Jim Broadbent comically portrays corrupt politician ""Boss"" Tweed.  As Amsterdam seeks to avenge his father and restore the power of the gangs, the draft for the Civil War looms.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is visually striking (note the transformation sequence at the end) and Martin Scorcese's attention to detail really shows.  As with many of his other movies (Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Casino), there is an abundance of violence; without which, the film would not succeed. The script is nothing terribly special (just your run of the mill revenge story with some historical flavor), but the acting is superb.  Daniel Day Lewis delivered one hell of a powerful performance.  If it weren't for Nic Cage in Adaptation, I'd say he would be an automatic for the Oscar.<br/><br/>Some say Scorcese reached his moment of glory with Taxi Driver and Raging Bull.  Others claim he found it later on with Goodfellas and Casino. Because of his paramount reputation, Scorcese was working against his past sucesses (as well as the current competition) with this film.  Many have been overly critical of it, citing it as a noted decline.  If this is a decline, then we can expect many more fine films to come before Scorcese's career bottoms out.  Decline or not, he has not lost the ability to tell a good story and Gangs of New York is well worthwhile.<br/><br/>8/10"

For starters, I was eager to see this movie because I'm a huge New York City history buff, and I wanted to see Scorcese's depiction of the Five Points. Unfortunately, the relatively mindless and overused plot (son wants to avenge father's death) interfered with what otherwise would have been a pretty good historical fiction account.  To those that disbelieved that New York was really as it was portrayed in the movie, all you have to do is read any book about the Five Points (now, Chinatown) to know that it is historically one of the worst urban slums in history, albeit not nearly as bad as some of the then contemporary writers made it out to be.  To that end, the movie was fairly faithful, with the exception that I think the timing of the historical characters to the events that actually took place were a little off.  Although the acting was decent, parts of the script, and especially the plot, were deplorable.  Overall, I give the movie was okay... it's not the type of movie I would rave about or recommend unless someone wants to see a brilliant acting performance from Daniel Day Lewis.

Personally, I never new anything about what happened in NYC during the 1860s. And the detail with which this is enacted is incredible.

There are interesting characters (Bill The Butcher played by Daniel Day-Lewis is not justs one of these, but the best thing in the movie in terms of character and acting), fantastic sets and wonderful costumes but little else. <br/><br/>Scorsese's direction is sporadically brilliant, but only sporadically. The different styles he uses in the film come across as messy rather than varied. This can also describe the soundtrack which begins as ""nu-classical"" and degenerates into melodramatic. The second half of the movie is also a casue for concern, as it seems to make little sense due to bad continuity, leaden editing and (one suspects) heavy cutting of crucial scenes.<br/><br/>As for the violence- it ends up bouncing right off you. This is due to the very poor editing (which also spoils the rest of the film) making the fight sequences dull and unmoving instead of powerful and masterful, like in Raging Bull or even Ridley Scott's Gladiator. <br/><br/>All this isn't to say that is a bad film, because it is not.

"JoeMiddletonAlba","9","0","0","15 February 2003"," Visceral story of revenge, friendship, love and bigotry
","This movie has `epic' written all over it. Fascinating throughout, Scorcese fires a highly unusual story through many twists and turns without ever losing sight of his most important characters.<br/><br/>The story is about the conflict between Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day Lewis) a bigoted but respected Don-type who runs early New York. Bill hates the Irish who he sees as coming in off the boats and getting their citizenship for nothing while he has fought for his corner (against an earlier set of Irish immigrants) and jealously guards it against all comers.<br/><br/>Bill's rival in the story, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio) is a brooding vengeance filled youngster and multi-scarred poorhouse survivor. He's haunted by the death of his long lost dad, a fighting priest who Bill killed but still grudgingly respects. However the story is complicated by the fact that as Bill has became older his faith in his vision of a pure New York without the Irish seems possibly less important to him than having someone to leave his `empire' to, and indeed many of his associates are his former enemies. <br/><br/>The real stand out in this film is (of course) the astonishing Daniel Day Lewis who gives a complex multi-layered performance of which even Robert De Niro would be proud. Day Lewis has a  convincing American Accent with a Bronx twang which may or may not have existed at the time but somehow works anyway. <br/><br/>The casting of Leonardo Di Caprio is justified by a moody yet restrained performance by Leo, looking extremely bulky and tough, fittingly so for the character he plays. Given Day Lewis and Scorcese's past work I'm sure many parts of the story from the awful costumes to the strangely named gangs, have been minutely researched and it has some similarity to the truth. Like Braveheart before it however, that's not the point. <br/><br/>This is a visceral story of revenge, friendship, love and bigotry. The whole cast is committed to the task and everyone in a  very large cast seems to fill their role admirably. (Jim Broadbent is typically good as a slimy politician). The subject matter is controversial with almost continual violence throughout and a script which is necessarily often nasty in it's emphasis. <br/><br/>Even myself whose links to Ireland are a few generations out of date, still felt my blood boiling at the treatment of our Celtic brothers. The resulting warfare results in no winners however and it is part of the magic of Day Lewis's performance that even though one dislikes his racist and evil character you can still understand his mindset and his sense of honour. In fact occasionally you find yourself (almost) rooting for Bill at the expense of Di Caprio's vengeful rival who Bill adopts unknowingly as his `heir'.<br/><br/>The film says a lot about racism and the stupidity of it without preaching in a complex and interesting tale. A difficult undertaking but brought off with signature style and substance. Cameron Diaz is also well cast,  bringing warmth, sassiness and some needed comic relief to her role as a beautiful (but scarred) pick pocket survivor who warms to Leo, but is also emotionally attached to Bill, her father/protector figure.<br/><br/>
A wonderfully non-happy and pointless ending puts all the previous squabbles into perspective with a glorious montage rounding off an extraordinary effort. Altogether, a bold and brilliant film from the greatest director of our time."
"cogs","8","0","0","15 February 2003"," brilliant spectacle / mediocre conventional drama
","""Gangs of New York"" is a deeply flawed film from Scorsese. It's certainly not a flawed masterpiece as many have asserted, but rather is an at times brilliant spectacle, but just as often a mediocre conventional drama. Scorsese seems too intent on making a big film with big set-pieces but has failed to devise this within a coherently constructed framework. Ultimately the film's greatest problem is one of intention  it seems to be about everything and nothing and finally rounds off in a confused mess. The final reel is perhaps the weakest 20 minutes in all of Scorsese's work. Some other shortcomings include the conventionality of the narrative  a straightforward revenge drama, with a love interest tacked on, with several soap-opera moments and melodramatic twists. Leo is okay, but he doesn't really impress. Cameron Diaz causes all kinds of problems, she is dreadful playing a character that is redundant. It's a stupid and useless character that detracts from the overall film. Given all of this there is a diamond in the rough  Daniel Day-Lewis. Playing a complexly drawn character Day-Lewis is sublime in giving the cinema's best performance in the last 3 or 4 years. He is simply astounding in every scene he is in and he dominates the other actors with an uncommon charisma and an indescribable attraction. Scorsese's film is moderately entertaining but I expect more from one of cinema's great filmmakers. I think history will show that Scorsese's earlier examination of New York's foundation - the modern masterpiece ""The Age of Innocence""; will dominate in all comparisons to ""Gangs of New York""."

","This film was a long time coming, but worth every minute of waiting. Firstly to review the acting.  Daniel Day-Lewis has given several astounding performances in his career and this is without a doubt one of them. DiCaprio also gives a solid performance whilst Diaz at least doesn't disappoint.  For all the criticism I've heard of Leo (probably because many people got sick of him after the amount of coverage he got post Titanic) I've never seen him give a bad performance.  In fact I'd rate him as one of the most talented young actors in hollywood at the moment.  His performance in this film is tempered with a good amount of emotion and a good amount of control.  He steers well away from melodrama and single-minded plans of revenge, which could have been so easy to do in this role, and instead delivers a carefully understated role, providing a character both confused and resolute.  His lack of a father figure draws him close to the very man he despises.  Amsterdam appears to be both desiring the fatherly attention from Bill and wanting to kill him; greek tradgedy anyone?!<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis was, to put it simply, spellbinding.  Although this was quite clearly a rendition of Robert de Niro in the role, it is an extremely good rendition.  I came out thinking Day-Lewis was more like de Niro than the man himself!  And the irony of casting an Irishman in this role (as well as an Irish band to perform the main song) I found amusing.  Perhaps this was to avoid coming across as deliberately anti-Irish.  The performance had me both despising Bill and empathising with him.  Despite his extreme bigotry, Day-Lewis portrays Bill as a very caring and principled man, both hungry for power, but also eager to father the community under his control. Don't get me wrong, this is a psychotic man, and when let loose Day-Lewis is frighteningly convincing as a psychopath.<br/><br/>This is yet another example of a master director at work.  The first thing that struck me in the opening moments was the apparent reference to an early Scorcese short ""The big Shave"" as Neeson cuts himself with a razor.  The short was a reference to the self-destruction of Vietnam, whilst in Gangs, Neeson is about to march to his own demise.  The next moment to strike me was the opening battle.  There was something musical about the choreography of this battle as the fight starts with little evidence of any blood shed, and then a crescendo of blood arises to the climax of the fight.  This for me was evidence that Scorcese never sits on his laurels, always looking for new techniques to affect the audiences reactions and emotions to any given sequence.  This trick helped to build an ever increasing momentum which comes to an abrupt and suprisingly sudden conclusion.  There are many other stand out moments in this film - too many for me to wax lyrical about here. Needless to say, whilst it isn't my favorite Scorcese film, it is nevertheless the latest evidence of his continuing genius."

This mess of a movie surely is the only evidence you need to back up a case. Scorsese's technical abilities are routinely praised but despite these, here there is no evidence of coherent narrative or character developement. Daniel Day-lewis's performance is ok in a cartoonish way. The rest are best passed over in silence. This film will garner Oscar nominations because Scorsese is seen as an artist. It is though only too apparent that the only movie brat who matters in 2003 is Steven Spielberg - who would have thought that 25 years ago.

","This movie starts out under developed and boring in my opinion. Di Caprio's father in the movie is killed right away.  Wish they would have developed his character.  Too much violence too soon.  Maybe a few scenes developing the father/son bonding etc. were needed.<br/><br/>Leonardo is either a actor you enjoy or don't enjoy.  The only movie that I really really enjoy his character is in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" Leonardo was totally mis-cast for this movie.  If I could think of someone else that could fit his character better I would name one but I can't.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz?  What the hell were they thinking?  Maybe a fresh face or someone that looks and acts similar too Julianne Moore would have been better. Cameron Diaz is over rated and should stick too her comedy movies and block buster Charlie's Angels type movies and leave the serious acting up too the serious actors.  Again a mis-cast in my opinion.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis.  Brilliant! Absolutely brilliant acting.  One of his best performances too date.  If it wasn't for Mr. Lewis I probally would never get around to ever seeing this movie again.  For the person that says his villian character was over developed....Shame on you!<br/><br/>If I were too see this movie again i would fast forward through the first 30 minutes and the last 30 minutes of this film and the stupid love scene. (Reminded me of Titanic *blech*)<br/><br/>The ending of the movie could have been a scene during the middle of the movie.  Why interupt the final battle between Bill The Butcher and Leonardo's character with looting and uprising and the bombing of lower Manhatten...and if so why not have the final conflict after the city was bombarded.  I expected a little bit more from Mr. Scorcese since this is a film he fought for years to have made.<br/><br/>Overall I give this film a 7.5 because of the poor mis casting of over rated actors/actresses. oh by the way John C Rielly should have had a bigger role. He is such a brilliant and gifted improvisational actor who is sorely under-rated.  Watch him work in ""Boogie Nights"" and ""Magnolia"" His acting leaves me in pure awe."
"Sledgeh101","Null","0","0","12 February 2003"," What do you do when you lose your way in the story?
","Gangs is one of those movies that could only have been made with a director like Martin Scorcese at the helm - 2 hours and 40 minutes? No problem. Graphic violence? No sweat. A movie with almost no story? You bet.<br/><br/>The story itself starts promisingly enough: Two rival gangs in mid 1800 America vie to see ""who will hold sway over these five corners"" as the villian, Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutter (you don't suppose he could have been named anything else?) growls before leading his group of men to do battle with another group called The Dead Rabbits (why they are called that is never really made clear in the story - supposedly a dead rabbit is supposed to represent freedom or something). The combat lasts a few minutes (though there were a few seconds when the editing looked so bad, I thought I was watching American Ninja 5 - a surprise for a Scorcese movie) before the leader of the Dead Rabbits is killed, with his kid watching from the sidelines. The kid is sent to an orphanage school, and all is forgotten about him for 16 years until he grows up to be Leo DiCaprio. After that... well, the thrust of the story seems to lead you to believe that Leo's Amsterdam will try finding a way to kill Bill - but for some reason, it takes him nearly 2 hours before he makes his first attempt. He reasons that he wants to kill Bill in front of everybody so they could see what would happen to him (not that most kings are actually assassinated in full view of the public, as Amsterdam mulls in one of MANY voice-over thoughts). For nearly 2 hours, we see him getting closer and closer to Bill - but showing virtually no signs of his inner struggle. Only when he sees a picture of his dead father - which Bill has hanging in tribute 'to the one man worthy of me' does he show any kind of emotion. After he finally makes an attempt on Bill's life, he spends the remainintg 40 minutes mulling what to do next (which inexplicably includes trying to hurt Bill politically) before finally getting a group of people together for the last big showdown - but even this is a letdown, as it's completely overwhelmed by a secondary storyline (about the people rioting because of the draft for the Civil War). We invest 2 1/2 hours for the son to wreak holy vengeance on his father's murderer - and it turns into something of a TKO instead. Part of the problem I had with this story was the inclusion of Jenny, a woman (played by Cameron Diaz) who doesn't seem to have a true sense of self. At the beginning, she's a pickpocket and a thief. Once Leo runs into her (and she lifts him of a personal memento), she holds a knife to his throat - and from then on she doesn't steal or pickpocket, because she's too much in love with Amsterdam. This would be bad enough, but what makes it even more strange is that there is supposed to be something between Jenny and Amsterdam's friend - at least in HIS mind, there should be - even though she is supposedly Bill's woman. The friend gets incredibly jealous when Ansterdam finally has sex with Jenny - but when Bill sees the two of them together in bed, he doesn't even bat an eye. Amsterdam's friend winds up telling Bill who Amsterdam really is - and Bill kills him for it. If you were able to make sense out of this past paragraph, you might have a future as a screenwriter for Martin Scorcese. Not all of the movie is bad. The visuals are stunning, and the movie does take an unflinching look at life in New York under the sway of ""Boss Tweed"" as he was known when he was mayor of New York (quick history fact - Tammany Hall, which is mentioned in the movie as a courthouse Tweed wants to build, was recently converted into the new headquarters for the NY Teacher's Association by Mayor Bloomberg, another extremely rich person. It goes to show that God DOES have a sense of irony). Corruption was rampant in that time, and people did whatever they could to make a living. In that sense, this movie does deserve praise for not backing away from this sensitive subject. However - I just wish that the story could have been more compelling - or at least a lot shorter (if this had not been commissioned by the director, the script would easily have had 40 minutes or so lopped off the top, which actually might have made it a better movie). Overall - I'd either go see it in a matinee or wait until it comes out in Blockbuster so you can rent it and fast forward through the boring parts - because trust me, there are a LOT of them in this movie."

","Ten minutes or so into this film I was convinced that it was going to be one of the great cinematic experiences of my life.  Ten minutes later, I was not so sure, and a couple of hours after that, I felt profound disappointment.<br/><br/>
There are a couple of other movies worth comparison:  Sam Mendes' 'Road To Perdition' and Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut'.  The first is worthy of comparison as a superb treatment of many of the same themes, and in similar contexts:  the father/son relationships, the historical context (in that case the Great Depression in place of the American Civil War), and the stunning cinematography.  The second film, Kubrick's last, should be noted as another example of creative overreach.<br/><br/>While Mendes displayed an achingly spare style, stretching an economy of means to its utter limit (and this is reflected by the minimalist performances by the entire cast), Scorcese instead attempted a storyline that seemed to exhort the weak cast (with the notable exception of Daniel Day Lewis) to achievements beyond their abilities.  The results were predictably lame.<br/><br/>Furthermore, his attempt to include peripheral characters such as Horace Greeley, PT Barnum and others, merely diluted the film's potential impact rather than contributing to the sense of milieu, which must certainly have been his intent.<br/><br/>It is in this respect that 'Gangs of New York' must be compared to 'Eyes Wide Shut' which I had similarly anticipated prior to its release.  I feel that Kubrick wanted a summation of many of his previous themes, but in the broadening of his thematic focus he relinquished the accuracy of his vision.<br/><br/>This movie is similar.  There are some breathtaking sequences, but as the movie progresses, it becomes less and less coherent.<br/><br/>All the same, as one reviewer put it, ""From a lesser director this film would have been regarded as a triumph..."""

","For those who enjoy movies made by Martin Scorsese, Gangs of New York provides many of his classic elements of his filmaking that have wowed audiences for decades. His grand sense of style, his ability to depict almost musky male bonding and certainly his joyous camera set pieces are demonstrated throughout this frequently tense period thriller. The length of the film has been criticised somewhat. There are moments of feeling halfway through War and Peace, but an epic does need space. This is the first film where Leonardo Di Caprio can clearly be seen acting, frequently and seriously and the performance seems indeed mature. Cameron Diaz enchants. Daniel Day-Lewis plays unbelievably well and doubtless will be remembered globally for this performance above all others to date. Scorsese himself appears (blissfully) briefly,in his Hitchcock fashion, which is now a fond tradition for him.<br/><br/>Like most Scorsese movies, this film will tolerate repeated viewings as the general quality is high, both the acting and camerawork. Moments remind one slightly of Casino, then The Colour of Money, then maybe even Mean Streets. But the period excitement creates much new ground for Scorsese to play with, that the somnambulent Age of Innocence did not. Certain camera elements seem to have opened new vistas for him. His camera direction revels in leaving behind the trinkets and cold steel of the 20th century and details those same aspects of the 19th in ways that are equally beatiful and horrifying."

I was impressed with the acting performances (especially that of Diaz, who I thought might flop).  However, there were several screen shots of extremely poor quality.  It was like they inserted unenhanced shots within the other well-done and improved shots for some unknown reason.  Every time they did this the lighting of the same shot was too light and the picture incredibly grainy.  At other moments in the film, the voice-overs were so poorly inserted over the film that you could hear the actors speaking when their lips weren't even moving.<br/><br/>While I agree that this film was good, it could have been so much better.

","Gangs of New York Rating **** Out of ****!! <br/><br/>Forget all those film critics out their somewhat bashing Scorese's new Epic historical crime saga saying its not worth the wait. This film is worth the wait. Just because critics like to compare this film with Scorsese's prevous works, it's not fair. It's Passionate, lurid, graphic, and bloody as sunday, Martin Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" peers deeply into the side of American history poisoned by ethnic and racial hatred. The sprawling, bare-knuckled drama takes place in a squalid quarter known as Five Corners where people lived in desperate poverty, brute force was the law and battle-ready gangs ruled the streets. <br/><br/>The most ferocious is Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a native-born American who uses his criminal syndicate to oppress and exploit the immigrants he despises. He rankles most over the ever-growing ranks of Irish Catholics, including the gang leader Priest (Liam Neeson), who dies in a brawl while his son watches. On one level, the movie is the personal story of that son as a grown man. After years in an orphanage, now calling himself Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), he returns to extract revenge. To get close, he joins Bill's gang, but finds himself seduced by the magnetism of Bill's power ,and by a pretty pickpocket named Jenny (Cameron Diaz).<br/><br/>Scorsese's more urgent interest is in the tumultuous, tragic history that is the backdrop to Amsterdam's story. While the people of Five Corners deal with gangs, corrupt politicians and poverty, the Civil War is raging. Immigrants are being conscripted by the thousands, while the affluent can buy their way out of the draft with $300. Scorsese summarizes the immigrant plight in a superb, uncut shot of new arrivals stepping off the boat into the arms of military officials who hand them citizenship papers and uniforms, then march them straight onto a transport ship as battlefield coffins are unloaded alongside them. Resentment over this system climaxed with the New York draft riots, a murderous, four-day rampage that left more than 100 people dead. <br/><br/>Scorsese depicts the riots in graphic, punishing detail. This kind of violence is hard to watch, indeed, but the director's aim is not mere sensation. He is making a fierce demand on the audience to understand the savage fury that attended the nation's long, tortured birth. ""Gangs of New York"" is a stunning visual spectacle,a complete triumph.<br/><br/>
Scorsese spares no grim detail in painting a portrait of the degradation in Five Corners invoked by history, imagination and urban folklore. Nor does Scorsese neglect to invoke the power of religion, one of his signature themes. For instance, when the gangs are preparing for their final showdown, we see leaders of both sides fervently invoke God's favor.Such moments define ""Gangs of New York"", a work of harsh and fearless artistry from a master at the top of his form."

","SPOILER WARNING What GONY shows us is a portrait of a film-maker in decline.  Martin Scorsese - practically a god to a certain generation of film-goers - has here made his most anonymous, bland, banal piece of work.  The worst thing I can say about this film is that it looks like it could have been directed by anyone.  Gone are MS's trademark flourishes (fluid camerawork, rapid editing, freeze-frame) only to be replaced with a dull flat style that, when coupled with the badly-written and ill-judged story, only serves to make the film a total bore. For the record, GONY is about fathers and sons (yawn - isn't just about every over-rated US movie about fathers and sons these days?), macho posturing (done so much better in earlier Scorsese movies - ""Taxi Driver"", ""Mean Streets"", ""GoodFellas"") and American history (potentially very interesting indeed, but here turned into a cartoon of corrupt politicians and unintentionally hilarious gang warfare).  The opening fight scene, after several minutes of build-up involving costumes and weaponry straight out of ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", is in slow-motion, with naff rock soundtrack accompaniment, for gawd's sake. The film is set in New York, ""lovingly-recreated"" in an Italian studio. So, it looks expensive but fake.  The cgi effects are feeble.  The costumes, dialogue and action are inane and at times laughable.<br/><br/>For all the critical praise heaped on Daniel Day Lewis's performance, one cannot help wondering what anyone expected - the man is a fine actor; of course he is going to give a good performance.  That is what he does. Leo and Cameron are as good as anyone could be when dealing with such under-written roles.  Leo alternates between seething rage at his father's death (hey, ass-hole, your dad was leader of a gang of vicious thugs - how did you expect he was going to die?) and a weird and under-developed admiration for Day-Lewis's character.  Bill the Butcher takes Leo under his wing (for no sensible reason, other than that the plot of the film demands that he do so) thus leading the way to potential tension between the forces at work on Leo.  Will he save Bill or kill him?  Does anyone care?  Will Bill find out that he has taken under his wing the son of some geezer he killed?  Does anyone care?  Luckily for Bill the only person who seeks revenge against him is Leo.  No doubt Bill has quite a few enemies, but Leo is the only one to do anything about it.  Cameron turns up at convenient moments, and disappears at equally convenient moments, to fit in with the obvious mechanics of the plot.  A black character is wheeled out for some kind of spurious racism-is-bad message at the end, in such a patronising and unbelievable bit of action that it makes me wince to think about it. Really, all the critics falling over themselves to praise this hogwash ought to be ashamed of themselves.  There's nothing in this film to redeem it. Technically it is awful, perhaps Scorsese's worst effort yet (I haven't seen ""Bringing out the Dead"" but I HAVE seen ""Kundun"", so I know what I'm talking about).   Just think of all the great movies that could have been made with the 100+ mill that this film flushed down the jakes.   Avoid this nonsense at all costs.  Oh, and finally, don't, please, bang on about Scorsese producing a four hour director's cut on DVD blah blah blah it said so in Empire magazine, blah blah blah which will show his true artistic vision.

","Certainly, not Scorsese's best movie, but a very interesting and lucid approach to American history. A better editing would have probably improved it a lot: the first part of the movie is excessively filled with gratuitous violence, which turns out being narratively redundant. The second part manages quite well to intertwine the individual plot with historical events. Scorsese's perspective on the Civil War might not appeal to the average American spectator - mainly for its lack of manicheism - but it is certainly deep and accurate. A ""western"" of the East Coast, from a stylistic point of view, Gangs of New York seems to be shot with Sergio Leone in mind."

","I was so looking forward to this but left feeling somehow disappointed, mostly because the whole thing was frankly rather unbelievable. Yes the direction and acting is brilliant and the cinematography is wonderfully beautiful. Daniel Day Lewis is amazing and his head in hand scenes and face and body language are worth the admission money alone. I do have problems though, first, Leonardo is undoubtedly a very pretty boy and good actor but he is certainly NOT a hard-man, Daniel Day Lewis brilliant though he is, hams it up in such a Faganesque manner that you do wonder how these two would last 5 minutes on Six Points with some of the characters and rival gangs that are lurking about nevermind that they are supposedly bossing the neighbourhood. Next, why does Amsterdam spend so long in the Butchers company and defend him so vehemently, does it really need 'Monk' to remind him that 'your father was always loyal to his people' and then return his cut throat to remind him that revenge is surely what should be on his mind?. The violence is strong and seems a bit over the top, also again a bit hard to believe that anyone could for example possibly survive the first mass battle. If you dont care for violence at the cinema this is certainly not for you. On the flip side the knife throwing scene is brilliantly exciting and Cameron looks genuinely frightened, I know I was, fell in love with her again - damn. The immigrant and civil war recurring theme does work well and is cleverly worked with immigrants arriving and being packed straight off to the south on one side of the dock while the bodies in coffins are being returned on the other. Don't get me wrong Im giving it a 7/10  and yeah its a good entertaining movie alright, I was just hoping for a 9.5 from 'Don' Martin."

","I went to see Gangs of New York with very high hopes after seeing the trailer many times and also seeing the cast list and director. As it starts it is very good with it catching my attention well and the story line is also made clear. But as the film goes on it drags out and becomes an effort to watch. For about an hour in the middle, the film is very tedious and doesn't seem to be going anywhere. But then it picks up for the ending and gives you a very compelling finale. The acting is superb in Daniel Day-Lewis but Diaz and Di Caprio are simply mediocre, I felt that Scorsese could have picked a more suitable actor for Di Caprio's role. To sum up Gangs of New York, the start, the ending and Daniel Day-Lewis's contribution are all very good. But the film is long and tedious at parts.

","This movie was great, thanks to the incredible attention to detail by the director.  From costumes to sets to gang members actions, Scorsese put a lot of time into recreating the era and people who would have been there. That is the most impressive part, the believability of being in this old world. Daniel Day Lewis was amazing.  Leonard DiCaprio was alright.  But the supporting actors had the toughest jobs on the set of filling the story in around these two, and I think they did a fine job.  All of this build up, however, leaves the audience wanting something more, and I think the movie never quite lives up to the standard it seems to set for itself.  It is almost anticlimactic in spite of the finale, and it is too bad it didn't find that missing element that would've secured its place as a modern-masterpiece.  Even as it stands, though, it is a very good film, and a testament to Scorsese's talent as a director putting a great deal of thought and energy into creating a world in which to tell a story.

But at Gangs of New York it is so different because Daniel-Day Lewis becomes Bill the Butcher you feel the pain and the anger that is in him its not like he was just playing the part, he was the part. I also researched a little about how they did the movie and Daniel-Day Lewis spoke the accent that he had to be every day for the whole filming of the movie and Leo hadn't heard his really voice to the premier of Gangs Of New York.

"Hengist777","7","0","0","27 January 2003"," Great film, DiCaprio does not belong in it
","Leonardo DiCaprio was well cast as a temperamental teenager, placing his emotional whims over the political situation. He was very convincing as a hedonistic slacker slumped on a tropical island. As a juvenile tricking people into thinking he's something he's not he seems right at home. But as a rebel and dynamic hero beset by the harsh prejudices of life with the awesome forces of history grinding on past him, he will never convince. Martin Scorsese's latest paean to New York is an historical epic in the same league as Gladiator or The Godfather that stays grounded in the gutter violence and street values he has previously portrayed. The treatments of history, of racial and religious conflict, of class prejudice and the nature of violence are all great Saturday night entertainment. Daniel Day-Lewis takes a quick break from boxing, or making Italian leather goods, or twiddling his thumbs to play one of the most menacing and morally challenging antagonists of the past ten years, and Liam Neeson's brief turn as Priest Vallon is nearly his equal. Cameron Diaz doesn't do too badly, although there is still a sense that she's just 'the girl,' even in a film of this calibre and ambition; she does a bit with not much of a role. The rest of the film, and it's getting on for two thirds, involves DiCaprio sneering a lot and making his voice coach cringe. He can convey a range of emotions but not a range of characters. Potentially it's Scorsese's greatest film if only he'd cast someone closer to Day-Lewis talent as the hero. As it is this is good entertainment and better filmmaking than anything else at the multiplex."

"jmh2350","7","0","0","1 February 2003"," Bold, epic, magnificent movie
","""Gangs of New York"" is a big, bold and magnificent; it is glorious movie-making, period.  The brilliance starts right away in this film, because it opens upon a seemingly alien world that the audience has never seen, but as it pours itself out into a small and poor inner 1846 New York City neighborhood we come to realize that what we are witnessing is not a ""Mad Max"" scenario, but something different out of American history with which most of us are unfamiliar.  A violent clash of Irish immigrants and anti-immigrants then ensues, preparing us not only for the individual human drama of the main characters, but for a drama much larger than those characters, and the horrific nature of the violence is cinematically accentuated by the staining of the snow-covered ground underlying the feet of the combatants with crimson (and, yes copious, blood).  From this point on we are led further and deeper into the lives of the main characters, with the backdrop of a burgeoning metropolis rife with political corruption and a nation divided by the Civil War.  The various effects that these larger issues have, or do not have, on all of the characters populating this movie is sometimes apparent, sometimes not, which is a tribute to the intellectual aspect of the film -- it lets the viewer think, ponder, and reach individual insights and conclusions.  The heart and soul of mid-19th Century Irish immigration, prejudice and poverty are well-portrayed with immaculate attention to detail in all aspects of film-making, most notably acting, set decoration, costuming, and cinematography, truly made to be seen on a big theatrical movie screen (those who wait for this to be released on dvd for their smaller home screens will have missed something special)."
"HenryHextonEsq","8","0","0","30 January 2003"," A rich film that does not quite go the distance.
","This film comes as a timely reminder that lives and political situations are never morally black and white. As one would expect, Scorsese avoids the terrible mainstream tendency to portray events as a simplified, 'noble struggle' by one side or the other. You have good attempts to try and portray things as they were - prejudice and idiosyncrasy are not covered up. I am no expert on this era of American history so cannot comment as to exact 'truth' to events, yet I applaud this film in its rich creation of the atmosphere and terrain of 1860s New York.<br/><br/>Firstly, in terms of negatives... the conclusion did lack the frisson and unpredictable drama promised by the rest of film. The final confrontation, while tied well to the draft-related events, lacks punch and I have heard historical basis. From the rest of the film one could not possibly believe Di Caprio could kill Day Lewis' character... Di Caprio for all the very still posturing, does not cut it as a tough man, while Day Lewis' crazed energy and precise force comes across crystal clear. The actual fight is barely shown at the end, which is telling. It seems to me for 'Amsterdam' to have been killed by the Butcher would have been far more likely and satisfactory note to end it on. <br/><br/>The presence of Di Caprio is destabilising to a script that calls for the Amsterdam figure to be a more impressive figure. Di Caprio simply lacks the stature to play the role, physically and in terms of his acting style. He does not convey much of a threat and comes across as an 'out of his depth' character much as dishonourable as the Butcher says he is. I'm surprised Scorsese didn't try to draw more out of the catholic guilt side of things, as it's certainly all set up for that. Amsterdam should have been a figure more convincing as a passionate, yet conflicted Irishman of that time. Di Caprio does the accent, yet he just doesn't convey all that much more of the character. While the character isn't meant to be anything like the man his father was, he is positioned in the film as close to a 'hero' and identification figure. Di Caprio doesn't bring the depth and interest to this role, which disrupts the balance of the film when you have a Day Lewis on rampant form. <br/><br/>Bill the Butcher is a great screen 'villain' precisely because he is a character of depth; a butcher, of animals and humans, who is also a theatrical showman and has strong moral convictions. You are wrapped up in this character who really seems of the time, unlike Di Caprio; this is Dickensian, broad playing of the best kind. Day Lewis' command of the screen is exemplary; it only makes you wish you had a more suitable actor in the other main role, who could play off him better. There are other fine performances; Jim Broadbent perhaps under-used as the typical politician figure, who is yet, rightfully, not made out as completely unsympathetic. He is a browbeaten man of some bewildered compassion; he has done what he does as that is what one had to do to get on in politics in such places. He is actually a figure very much to identify with; one of the few who does not resort to the prevalent violence. Brendan Gleeson is even more neglected - why not have had more scenes of his character and cut some of the Di Caprio slack? - as this ""Monk"" figure. I guess a lot was cut which made his character seem perhaps a little lacking here; it seems stuff is missing. Gleeson is magnificent as a straight-talking, wise figure; shame we don't get more of this character.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is capable enough at playing her character, yet the character is quite a waste of time in terms of the narrative, and is only necessary for the role she plays in understanding the Butcher - her telling of how he took her in et al - otherwise, it just seems for box office they had to slot in some token romance. Though, at least, Scorsese doesn't overdue the unwarranted sentiment here. The amount of screen time she gets is a waste really, of the film; it's economics talking here, rather than Scorsese's artistic sense. _Gangs of New York_ is a very enjoyable picture; Scorsese turning to history is a welcome change, and the realisation of the period is wonderfully rich in detail. It is another 'masculine-centred violent culture'-type story for Scorsese, yet seems very fresh due to some fine performances and a thoughtful approach. The film is sadly hamstrung, however, by the insufficiency of Di Caprio, the over-emphasis on Diaz and under-emphasis on Gleeson, and its finale is disappointingly pat. A worthy, enjoyable enterprise though, with the era brought to light and a performance to be remembered by Day Lewis. Always good to see a film in the mainstream that avoids the same old awful sentimentalism and simple-minded taking of sides.<br/><br/>Rating:- ****/*****"

","I had heard that this film had been cut from 4 hours 30 minutes to a less back-aching 3 hours before I ever stepped inside the cinema to see it. But it was painfully obvious after only 15 minutes in, that this was the case. Scenes jumped (literally) from situation to situation. One famous one where Leo is holding a bag over his shoulder from his POV / down by his side from Henry Thomas' POV and so on and so on ..... It was such an obvious editing mistake that I don't know how anyone could possibly miss it ..... unless of course their head was fried from cutting an hour and half out of a film and still trying to make it look seamless.<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>The film suspended belief right from the off... but I was willing to go into that mode in the hope that I would get swept along with the story. I did - just about - for the first 2 hours but then it descended into farce.<br/><br/>The final hour where everything comes together on one day - riots / final confrontation with Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam Vallon / cannonball attacks / friends ratting you up - just does not hold water. The film smacks of ""we're running out of money so let's wrap this up as soon as possible"". There is absolutely no sense of drama in the final showdown - no build up, no suspense, nothing. Just simply bang-bang you're dead. Roll the credits.<br/><br/>The message it is trying to deliver is of the futility of war but the necessity to fight for what you have. A paradox if ever there was one.<br/><br/>As for the actors - Day-Lewis (as usual) is superb / Leo does well as does Diaz and Gleeson. The sets - okay but not as grandiose as I was made to believe by the glossy Film mags. The violence - well there's certainly enough of it and graphic too (the head-butting scene is especially stomach-churning). The storyline - if Scorcese had kept it as a simple, straight-forward boy-comes-back-to-avenge-father's-killing story it would have worked better. The whole issue of the politics / the draft / riots just muddled things up and lengthened the film unnecessarily.<br/><br/>It's no epic and will not remain long in people's memories. However - the DVD release should be interesting to see if a director's cut is given and for all those deleted scenes.<br/><br/>6/10"

It all happened very quickly at first and then I found it dragged for a while before picking up towards the end. I was surprised at how quickly Amsterdam became close to the Butcher, it didn't seem convincing that he could do it so quickly. There were other areas but overall it does not spoil the story. Lewis gives a great performance and I found myself sympathising with both of the main characters, even though Lewis plays a ruthless gang leader, De-caprio gives a solid performance. I felt that De-Caprio's character was slightly let down by a script that seemed to give Lewis to strong a role relative to De-Caprio, the balance didn't seem quite right, not sure on that one. Diaz is good to, this is a long way from Charlie's Angels and The Mask. The action scenes were well done, very much in the way that many newer war films are done with plenty of 'realism' (i.e gore). The music is excellent during the battle scenes but outside of these scenes the music is hardly used or no where nearly as good. The settings and sets are superb and credit must go to those who created them as they look stunning.<br/><br/>I often look back on a film and if I can remember the majority of what happened it usually means it was a favourite but with this I don't think its up their with the best, it is not far behind.

The story here is that a kid from a tough neighborhood sets out to avenge his father's death.  That's it.  DiCaprio's character seems to have no other goal and thus comes off to me not only secretive and brooding, but largely uninteresting.<br/><br/>Central characters of films should have big goals, with the revenge motive thrown in for good measure.  As it was, Bill the Butcher was a far more interesting character and the film should have centered on him, with DiCaprio telling Bill's story.

","Much has been said about Gangs of New York's narrative problems and sure Cameron Diaz's character is for the most part unnecessary, but for me the film was not about character studies or historical facts. Gangs of New York is all about capturing a time and a place and sucking the viewer into that place for the duration of the film. <br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers*<br/><br/>Scorsese's vision and direction in Gangs is, in my opinion, his greatest yet and that's quite a statement considering his past accomplishments. He barely gives the viewer time to settle in their seat by opening the film with a battle so ferocious that it literally leaves you breathless by its intensity. From this point on though, Gangs has proceeded to split its viewers in two, those that are awed by Scorsese's vision and those that find the film lacking in narrative focus and a chaotic mess.<br/><br/>
The lack of narrative focus and the chaos of the film's atmosphere is exactly what I believe makes Gangs stand out as a cinematic triumph. By evoking an atmosphere of chaos, Scorsese accurately allows the viewer to feel they are in a place like the Five Points where chaos reigned and order was nowhere to be found.  The detail of the sets and incredible cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is absolutely stunning and even when the narrative pace slows, Scorsese's powerful vision never ceases to amaze.<br/><br/>
And as is usual there must be a character that symbolically represents their environment, like Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, and in Gangs that character is Bill the Butcher, who is brought to vibrant, frightening life by Daniel Day-Lewis, who (Sorry, Jack) deserves to win the Oscar.  Bill is a character of unending contradiction and fascination and if one remembers nothing else from Gangs they will remember Daniel Day-Lewis's performance.<br/><br/>The film concludes with the draft riots that takes place on the same day that Amsterdam Vallon and Bill the Butcher meet for the battle that the film builds towards. The battle never takes place though, at least not in the way the characters envisioned, because the army is called to put down the riots. Some may be put off by the constant cutting between the riots and the conflict in the Five Points, but to me it was brilliant. Throughout the film Scorsese juxtaposes the problems of the Five Points to the problems with the draft and the Civil War slowing building towards the fateful day when everything will come to a head.  Suddenly the battle in the Five Points is shown to be pointless when compared to the whole of the city and the Nation that is currently in strife, which I believe is a brilliant point. It shows that petty things like revenge mean nothing compared to the greater conflicts in the world. An important lesson to be learned.<br/><br/>The only real fault that anyone could really say about Gangs of New York is that it may be too ambitious, but in this day of age when it's hard to find any sort of ambition in the movies, I'll gladly take a film that tries to reach too far over a film that doesn't have any ambition whatsoever."

","Gangs of New York was not a favorite Scorsese because it used as its basis a richly descriptive book and boiled it down to a student chasing mentor story (much more effective in Scorsese's Color of Money).  The shame is that the Gangs were all very interesting in the book.  Really, the movie is hardly about the Gangs of New York at all.  That said, Daniel Day Lewis is absolutely amazing and deserves a nomination.  He is relentless."

","Anyone who has seen this film can be in no doubt of the skill of Martin Scorsese as a director, or Daniel Day Lewis as an actor. Both perform superbly in what surely must go down in history as a (slightly) flawed classic. The fact that Cameron Diaz and Leonardo Di Caprio were not in the same league as Day Lewis should not spoil the film. The difference was more due to the amazing performance by Day Lewis than any particular faults on the part of Di Caprio or Diaz. I felt that Diaz's character was not given the time to develop into someone very meaningful and she is therefore an easy target when criticizing this film. However due to commercial pressures, Scorsese (allegedly) had to cut the film from the 4hours that he felt was necessary, to a more public friendly format of 3hours (approx), so the directors cut on DVD should prove interesting. This also leads to some rather bizarre jumps in the plot; an example might be the speed and ease with which Di Caprio forms an army. But from the very first battle sequence it is clear that this is a film of the finest quality."

","(Possible Spoiler) From the director of Casino, Goodfellas, and Raging Bull, Martin Scorsese wins my affection yet again for this great movie. Everything from set design to Daniel Day-Lewis's performance made this movie an enjoyable experience. The film runs for around two and a half hours and features gold supporting performers in this circa Civil War epic. Liam Neeson (Schindler's List), John C. Reily (Magnolia) & David Hemmings (Gladiator) are only to name a few. Although the story was very fulfilling, the real treat was with the set design and cinematography. With the macabre undergrounds of a once thriving colony of gangs to the snow covered town center to which some of the most important scenes originate and thrive from, GONY's environment is a breath of fresh air. The acting in the movie was fair and sculpted together nicely to provide round characters with full-fledging emotions and thoughts. Daniel-Day Lewis, whose been on a five-year hiatus from his last work, The Boxer, stole the movie with his ""Ghengis Khan with a bipolar  disorder"" palette. Even with the corrupt power he pitches and the arrogant aroma he sends off, by the end of the film, you can't help but like the guy.<br/><br/>Socsese stamps the theme of the movie at the end by showing it in the eyes of Lewis and DiCaprio. Following this key moment, Scorsese pays omage to the people of New York by showing the evolution of the city from a gravesite overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge. Here, Scorcese shows four evolution times in New York: 1864; The time this epic took place, ~1910's; early development of the skyline, ~1930's; Empire State building is added to the facade, & Present; The world Trade center towers over the New York Skyline; a bittersweet end to a great movie."

","A film that, despite the magnificent sets, never quite seems plausible. Leonardo DiCaprio has the presence and mien for this story, but somehow the direction given this actor with great charisma (and hints at great depth) seems off.  Also, the use of Mr. DiCaprio as narrator, though contextually logical, prods the audience to keep comparing him to other Scorsese narrators, such as Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, and Joe Pesci.  The comparisons distract, but are hard to avoid.<br/><br/>Much of the fine work Mr. DiCaprio does is gravely undermined by the scenes with Cameron Diaz.  When they are together the movie suddenly gets a Disney feel--and I don't mean a Disney movie feel, but a Disney World Theme Park feel.  Ms. Diaz seems like a costumed park employee daintily skipping her way through realistic settings.  When Mr. DiCaprio is with her in a scene, he too seems to be merely wearing a costume, rather than professionally acting.  It would be interesting to know what led Scorsese to the casting decisions.<br/><br/>There is much worth seeing in this film full of interesting visuals, but fans (like myself) of Scorsese have been spoiled by films that are electrifying, not just entertaining."

","Scorsese again delivers a first class movie filled with excellent performances and stunning sets which by far offset weaknesses with the plot and indeed the historical accuracy of the piece. The real ""Bill the Butcher"" was killed in 1855 - years before his on screen demise during the brutal Draft Riots of 1863. Nonetheless, Daniel Day Lewis is stunning in a role which could have easily become comical in the hands of a less capable actor. Leonardo Di Caprio is adequate in his role as the vengeful hero Amsterdam, but he is still too much of an acting lightweight to share the screen with the likes of Day Lewis & the marvellous Jim Broadbent. The Cameron Diaz role seems to be a clear case of box office appeal casting. She adds nothing to the plot but happily for the viewer does not really damage the movie either. Maybe her inclusion was to offset the maleness of this film - the only other notable women, such as the vicious female fighter in the opening battle make only a minimal contribution to the plot. I felt the movie was a little too violent, especially the carnage of the opening battle, where numerous slashings and skull crushings are depicted in gory detail. The film itself is fantastic to look at, though the soundtrack is very disappointing (apart from Othar Turner's mesmeric fife & drum music) considering how well Scorsese usually uses contemporary music of the era to underscore the visuals. Though it does not match his earlier classics such as 'Taxi Driver' or 'Goodfellas', 'Gangs of New York' is still a highly watchable and interesting production from a great director."

He is boring and acts the same in every movie he does.  He looks like a drip and acts like one.  Blanking this sore point from one's mind, the film has some excellent costumes (love those hats!

(well they aren't real though are they....)  I did feel that the complete point of this movie was wasted on the Irish having a mass slapping with the natives (Amercians) and there was a bit of a love affair in the middle.  (Spoiler alert)  It all boils down to Leonardo wanting revenge on his father's death at the beginning of the film.  Didn't really see what it had to do with all the fighting and it felt that Leo had just a personal vendeta with Daniel Day Lewis and after he kills him isn't really bothered about what the Irish do! But wasn't that the point to these ""Gangs In New York?""  The fight scenes are savage but well put together. Innocent beatings/killings of the black people was a bit too graphic, but yes it was making a point of what it was like back then, but I couldn't feel a bit sorry for some of the black people in the audience.

","This film is amazing! I am a media student, I study films and it is true to say that Gangs of New York does not have a huge amount to say. It is not heavily symbolic and it is a mainstream money-grabber, however sometimes films do not have to be original or re-defining to warrant praise.<br/><br/>No one would deny that this film is visually stunning and contains some breathtaking action scenes, on par with Saving Private Ryan. This alone is a good enough reason to see it, yet there is so much more to this movie. The acting is first-class, Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant and Caprio holds his own in a cast with overwhelming ability. The one thing that lets the acting down is the erratic Irish accents, a mix between American and Father Ted, but this is a minor gripe. Many argue the story is poor and the ending even worse, well the story (without spoiling it) has been seen countless times before and has been successful. As I said before, a plot does not have to be original to be effective. This story weaves perfectly with the action, drama and comedy and allows Scorsese to display his superb talent of portraying real problems with an entertaining exaggeration Gangs of New York should leave you thinking ""wow"" just watch it for fun and not to see if it's worth the hype."

Perhaps it is a victim of the hype, especially since it is a Scorsese picture that he had himself dreamt of making for some time. Nonetheless, I found it to be powerful and gripping throughout. I am rarely stuck to my seat at the end of a film with little to say, but the film was a true cinematic spectacle and I was rather moved by the whole thing.<br/><br/>Much has been said of Day Lewis' performance and I have to say is that it was indeed incredible. DiCaprio's screen presence was enough to carry him through the film with merit. If a little uninspiring, he was still very watchable. The love triangle was seemingly included for the audience and was a little insincere at times yet did not ruin the flow of the movie. I liked the way that Bill essentially became Amsterdam's surrogate father - a dichotomy of love and hate that underlined the general theme of conflict. The supporting actors complimented proceedings, with John C. Reilly and Henry Thomas portraying their characters well.<br/><br/>The effort and love poured into the film is quite astounding. From the incredible, expansive sets to the costume design, the whole film seems very authentic and convincing. Scorsese did not glamourise the violence, but incorporated it fairly seamlessly into the story. Overall, it succeeded as a film in my eyes. I enjoyed it, I was immersed throughout and was fascinated by a period of history which I knew very little about.<br/><br/>
Finally, as for the ending, there seems to be a consistent debate as to whether the two leads should have a big gung-ho punch-up after all the building tension. Personally, I felt the end was handled rather well as it was firstly unexpected and also powerful and poignant. Revenge is gained, yet there is a moving moment when the two adversaries realise that their own personal agendas are nothing when they are surrounded with the destruction of their territory and the crushing of the American dream.

But then, a lot of people seem to forget, the character Leo diCaprio is portraying is a young man who has spent his whole life in New York, so of course his 'Oirish ' accent is going to be a little bit skewed, just as it would be in 'REAL' life. As an Irish native I can tell you, and just about everyone else who lives in this country would back me up, that it's not at all unusual to meet a friend who has just come back from a working summer in the US talking with an American accent, and trying desperately to keep it up for the next 6 months until they realise that they sound ridiculously phoney, and then grow out of it. If there's a fault to be found with this movie, it's that the last 45-60 minutes of the movie try to cover too much, and the viewer gets a sense of scenes being rushed. I think a lot of people, including Americans, who are not familiar enough with the historical period which serves as the backdrop in which the story is set, and the FactUAL events portrayed in it, and which did actually occur, will be hopelessly lost in the last hour of the film. No loss. If you're not interested in the history of the period, and you're just looking for a few cheap hours' thrill, you've got no business going to see this film, because, like I say, you'll only get confused.<br/><br/>Yes, it has it's faults, it is a flawed film...like every other film that was ever made. But it's a story. Set in a historical background. Just like most period epics. Deal with it. And as for those who have suggested that it's just another boring, re-hashed story about 'vengeance'...a word of advice - go back and watch it again. Pay particular attention to the 'Oscar' scene (Butcher's soliluquoy with the US flag draped around his shoulders after Amst wakes up beside Jenny) and watch more closely during the 'climactic duel'. If you can't see what's actually going on there, you're blind. I admit I was surprised as well, and initially thought the ending didn't fit the story up to that point. But the more I thought about it, the more I realised that Scorsese was working on something quite subtle, something I couldn't really put my finger on at first. But several hours after leaving the theatre, it all made sense, and it's something which transcends the hum-drum, senseless, pointless violence we all ee depicted on our screens every day of the week, something which trascends genre, nationality, ethnicity, so-called vengeance...it disappoints me that a film of such meaning and depth has been lost on so many amateur 'critics' who just can't see the wood for the trees, especially in America, post 9/11/01, and to think that Di Caprio's latest film 'Catch Me If You Can' is outperforming GONY at US box offices since both their releases,...is very, very sad indeed."

As a historian/producer with 3 EMMY's, I got the 1928 book the movie was based on. And it's right on. Back then even more took place. Finding ""5 Points"" on a New York Historical Society map was fun. It's interesting to parallel those days with a message for today. When you have corruption in government be it city or Federal, the decline in integrity and social values trickles down to all levels of society. I wondered at first if this film had any social redeeming values. And it does.

","Daniel Day Lewis comes off an early retirement to do this film. Woah, was it worth it. Remember that tall clean shaven guy with a hint of native indian in his voice from the Last of the Mohicans....abracadabra, he's gone and is replaced by Billy the Butcher, a painstakingly slow talking, moustachioed, fake eyeball wearing, Bronx speaking native of New York. What a transformation! If you thought he was good in Mohicans just wait til you see him hear. Awesome. In each of Scorsese's recent gangster films, we see one character far more evil than anybody else near the screen. In both Goodfellas and Casino this part was played by Joe Pesci who is one of the most disturbing characters ever portrayed. Bill the Butcher comes close. That insanely deep blue-eyed stare and the twitchin' moustache are just plain scary.<br/><br/>O yes, and there was a film attached to this character wasn't there. Gangs is a great work by Scorsese definitely up there with Casino, if not quite Goodfellas (a film anyone is going to be hard pressed to topple). The scene is 1860s New York and the five points. Here instead of his usual cast of Harvey Keitel, Robert deNiro, Joe Pesci et al. Scorsese decides to use a slightly different set of players. Leonardo DiCaprio plays the ""hero"" and his leading lady, Cameron Diaz.<br/><br/>Amazing camera shooting is a definite highlight. Best moment? when McGinn kicks open the doors at the beginning so Liam Neeson can march his gang out into the street. As in all of Scorsese's greatest films we see the whole plot unfold through the eyes of two characters. The Butcher and Amsterdam (the Priest's son). As in Goodfellas and Casino we are forced to follow and do exactly what the characters on the screen are doing and as a result we feel it when Bill savagely head butts Amsterdam in the face and cringe when he throws a knife into Monk McGinn's back. Woah, that Day Lewis again, what an actor!!!<br/><br/>The only problem with this picture is the ending. The whole theatre was poised for the mother of all gangland battles and all we got was a half-hearted excuse for a tussle. Bill the Butcher the hardest, most solid guy in the Points really should have beaten the stuffing out of that little upstart Amsterdam but the trifling army just gets in the way of what would have been a epic battle. Obviously a symptom of the fact that Scorsese tried to incorporate the main story, and the story of New York's Civil War experience into one film. However, apart from this one glaring error the issues raised here are very well presented. Especiually the plight of the african-american trying to live in the city.<br/><br/>Overall, top film.

"goya-1","Null","0","0","16 January 2003"," A depressing experience
","I can't get over the fact that Martin Scorsese, whom I regard as one of this generation's most talented directors, could have made such a lousy film. But it's not just lousy ; this savage, brutal, incoherent piece of crap is also profoundly disturbing.<br/><br/>The story revolves around two characters in 1840's New York. On the one hand there's Leonardo De Caprio as the young Irishman who sees his improbably gallant father slain in a street fight and spends the next 16 years - and believe me, it *feels* like sixteen years - plotting revenge. Leonardo, pretty as ever, is thoroughly unconvincing as a tough guy ; he spends most of the film either getting beaten, slashed, burned and otherwise thoroughly trounced, or else whining and blubbering about it. When he attempts to look menacing, all he manages to do is curl his upper lip in a kind of sneer with which, one imagines, he is wont to insult waiters in overpriced Beverly Hills restaurants.<br/><br/>The real star of the film is Daniel Day Lewis, as The Butcher, leader of the ""Natives"", a gang of ""native-born Americans"" whose main characteristic is that they hate the Irish, the ""Niggers"" and the ""Chinks"". Day Lewis swaggers his way through sets designed to represent mid-19th century New York, brutalizing the helpless, terrorizing abject and caricatural politicians, eliminating his opponents by hurling meat-cleavers at them when their backs are turned, and torturing Di Caprio in a brutal central scene which is clearly revelatory of a very sick mind indeed.<br/><br/>On the historical level the film might be almost amusing. One never for an instant believes any of this, nor believes one is anywhere but a very expensive, computer-enhanced Hollywood set. The supposed Irishmen prance about like monstrously overgrown leprechauns, and the ""historical"" portrayals of warfare between gangs, police, troops and foreman are about as credible as a Keystone Kops routine, only a lot less funny. It's hard to tell which is more depressing, Di Caprio's phoney Irish brogue or Day Lewis' bargain-basement  Archie-Bunker accent (""youse guys""). The film, as I said, belongs to Day-Lewis, who gives a skillful albeit way-over-the-top performance. But the problem is that we are clearly supposed to like and admire this psychotic, sadistic, xenophobic, racist bully, as even the Di Caprio character does ; indeed the film is full of the rival gang-leaders' pathologically intense homoerotic attraction towards one another. Presumably this macho touchy-feeliness is what makes the characters admirable in Scorsese's eyes. There is precisely one female speaking role amid the cast of hundreds ; the few other women in the film are whores or - another indication of the film's historical plausibility - axe-swinging street fighters.<br/><br/>Yet at the end of it all, when we have witnessed buckets of blood and brutality, when we've watched mobs lynch black men and set them on fire, when we've seen anti-draft rioters, who clearly have Scorsese's sympathy, lay waste to ""Nigger"" boarding-houses, because, in words of Di Caprio's sententious voice-over, the poor don't give a damn about the fight against slavery ; we begin to get a glimpse of what Scorsese is really on about here. As this tedious and brutal film lumbers on towards its predictable conclusion, we realize that for Scorsese these savage, sadistic, racist thugs are admirable ; they are, in a sense I'm unable to understand, the ones who ""built America"", although by the time Di Caprio as narrator tells us this, they have already spent three hours tearing down everything in sight. We are supposed, I guess, to weep, when the cowardly Union troops mow these ""heroes"" down, thereby preventing them from lynching more ""Niggers"". I personally found myself wanting to see the entire team responsible for this atrocity of a film, with Scorsese first and foremost among them, placed squarely in their sights.<br/><br/>Is there any sociological or world-historical significance to this paean to stupidity, cruelty and violence? Together with similarly brutal recent films like Gaspar Noe's _Irreversible_, will it be used by future cultural historians to study just how sick contemporary Western society was at the beginning of the third millennium ? I leave these questions to future pundits. One thing seems certain about this film, and this makes me sad : it marks the definitive fall from grace of a very good director, whom I, for one, can never again respect."

","It was only at the very end though that I realised what was happening - Scorcese was 'doing' Sergio Leone. This I gathered from the way there is no title at the begining but at the end - after three hours of a revenge drama set against the meticulously accurate backdrop of Historical America taking in questions of internal American shame, and political corruption as a staple of the formation of American way of life - at the end, the screen goes black and the words 'Gangs of New York' appear on the screen for a few moments (I think in the form of a print press template) before the credits flash on the screen in a curiously generic  'western' typeface. For those in the know (and that would be me and.......?) it was a moment of revelation. Unfortunately, Scorcese didn't have Morricone to score the film, as I'm sure he was aware personally and very sad about, so the film never reached the peaks of greatness that Leone managed with his 'History Trilogy' - Instead, Scorcese has a very contemporary rock soundtrack with U2 groaning over the credits which sours things considerably. Also, although Daniel Day Lewis was very good, I couldn't help but think he was 'doing' Robert De Niro."

","SPOILER!<br/><br/>Before I potentially rip apart Martin Scorsese or the message I got in the last few moments of the film, let me just say the movie was very good. Daniel Day- Lewis was superb and DiCaprio had his moments (although if you would like to see him in his recent bests, walk down one more theatre at your local multiplex to Catch Me If You Can). Beautifully filmed, this movie brings out a side of New York not known by many people, or at least me.<br/><br/>Right up until Jim Cutting find out Vannen's true identity, I was thoroughly enjoying this story of revenge. After that, the point of the film got fuzzy. I wasn't sure who was a bad guy anymore. Scorsese spent two hours clearly drawing a line between good and bad, and then totally disreguarded that in the last hour. The climax focused more on a subplot whick took up maybe ten minutes of the rest of the film, rather than the main story. This I found slightly annoying.<br/><br/>But, the real kick in the gut came in the last group of shots in the film. A digital time lapse shot over the next 150 years of New York. We see the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, buildings, more buildings, and then finally, the World Trade Center. And then...a fade out? This was a film anaylzing the hardships New York has faced throughout it's history. I think it  was tastefully profound to see that New York can still emerge victoriously after to grusome battles that it has seen through the ending series of stills. But they forgot one of (if not the most) important day in New York's history, September 11th. After DiCaprio just finished telling us how bloody the riots were under the torched skies of New York, we begin to realize that blood in the streets and smoke in the skies looks familiar. More people died on 9/11 than in the riots, or any other single day in New York, or America's history. I think for a Native-New Yorker (Scorsese) to gloss over that day, despite how important it is and how it could have potentially augmented his own story, is a crime. If there was a shot following the last one, without the WTC, I think it could have left a thought in peoples minds about how we as a city and as a nation are still fighting the same basic battles.<br/><br/>7/10...oh, and btw Marty...get rid of the ending credits and music.

","The first time I heard of Gangs of New York was way back in February of 2002. I was hearing from all over the place that this would be THE film of 2002, and suddenly I couldn't wait to see it. So for ten months, the anticipation built, and when opening day finally came around, I grabbed a friend and we sat back to enjoy the show. Well, I really hate to admit it, but I was disappointed with what I saw.<br/><br/>What is going to happen with this epic film however, it that the audience who sees it is going to be so caught up in the stunning sets, costumes, and accuracy in historical events that the main plot is going to slip form their minds. If you want the truth, I saw no main plot being developed during the course of this film. Gangs of New York starts off with a bang, and for the first five minutes of the film, I was caught up in 1860-s New York. We are introduced to Priest Vallon and Bill The Butcher in the beginning of the film, and the scenes with Liam Neeson were absolutely stunning. As soon as we jump forward sixteen years however, the film goes downhill.<br/><br/>
For the rest of the film, I found myself being bored with what was going on on screen. Nothing happening kept me interested at all. Little areas here and there caught my attention, but these were far away from each other. And those little areas that sparked my attention involved the ever wonderful Daniel Day-Lewis. He is amazing here, and assures himself an Oscar nomination next month. Leonardo DiCaprio was very surprising on his acting abilities in this film. He was able to hold his own on the screen with Day-Lewis. <br/><br/>So really, the only problem I had with this film was the story. It just so happens that story is the most important element in a movie. Martin Scorsese did a supurb job as far as visuals, but story fails in this picture. He could have done so much with this film. Even still, I'd recommend this film simply for the great sets, costumes, historical accuracy, and a chance to see Daniel Day-Lewis become Bill The Butcher. A visual feast, yet I was left disappointed. Others were blinded by this, and I wish I was one of them.<br/><br/>

","I cannot believe Scorcese has not been honored with a best director oscar. He deserves it.  Forget about taking away Costner's, give him Spielberg's. I think DiCaprio took a big chance working with Day-Lewis and Neeson.  He still has to grow as an actor, and does not disappear into characters like the great ones do.  (and I wonder how the Irish rate the coming and goings of his tepid brogue, which at best I'd say is better than Mickey Rourke managed in Prayer for the Dying.)  As for the twin towers, seeing the image of them at all, anywhere, unexpectedly brings tears to my eyes.  It has nothing to do with the movie.  I thank god for directors like Martin Scorcese, who don't just put out cash factory films, but give me cinema. He is one of the great ones.  He doesn't try to simplify things, just keep all the necessary facts and images in their places.  A real story teller, not social messenger.  I don't go to movies often, and I had a choice between Gangs, Rings, and 25th Hour, and I bet on Scorcese.  When you're not sure what movie to see, you have to choose the best director.  I must say I was waiting to see if Harvey Keitel would be in some shadowy corner of the Schermerhorn billiard room, and think that Poe ringer was coolly played. All in all, except for DiCaprio being less than shimmering and Diaz looking less than Irish, I give it a 10,  and a $10 as I'll go see it again before it leaves theatres.  I wish the box office figures were weighted.  At 3 hours, it just can't be shown as often or on as many screens as its competition.  It deserves to be higher, but I imagine a lot of people must have to pass up seeing a film if their only options are 6:45 and 10:00 pm showings.  I had to travel 25 miles to catch an 8:30 show.

However the narrative through which these aesthetic devises are used (The 5 Points) is such a minor part of American history it is without regret that i suggest that this tale originates in Hollywood (coincidently about New York)rather than in New York. I believe this 'Invention or Exaggeration of American History' acts in allowing American audiences to identify with themselves, a process which has been made all the more difficult in the wake of recent tragic events and political upheaval. I'm not suggesting that this film is of propagandistic nature but the extent to which the film promote 'Americanness' is obvious. 1) The scene is which Bill Cuttings sits at the side of Amsterdam's bed draped in the American flag. Cuttings proceeds to inform Amsterdam of the violent struggles in this life and the way in which he has survived, ""Fear"".

Instead I will complain about the massive flaws in the script and general mood of the film.<br/><br/>The film didn't need a hero or a love interest but for some unknown reason Scorsese felt obliged to include both (as do most modern American film makers). Most great films have characters that you either love or loathe but throughout the film I could not help but feel that Bill The Butcher was generally a more likeable person than Amsterdam. For a start Amsterdam (as pointed out in the film) is sneaky, conniving and treacherous character who is seeking revenge for his Farther who died in a battle he willfully entered into. In no part of the film are we led to believe that his Farther was a noble or valiant character, in fact from my impression he was just as ruthless as Bill. This I appreciated.<br/><br/>I cannot help but feel that the film would have been so much better, if the audience had been left to make there own minds up about all of the characters.

While people tend to get quite worked up about those in general, I believe the message he wants to get across still stands. The acting is brilliant; I don't usually like Leonardi DiCaprio all that much, in spite of some excellent past acting work in 'The Basketball Diaries' and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape'. In this movie, however, he really shines and I am forced to reconsider.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show as Bill the Butcher and has my vote for an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

This film has lavish sets and art direction throughout, not to mention terrific costuming and attention to detail. It does feel a bit Hollywoodish at times, but what do you expect when a studio invests this much time and money into a picture? Cameron Diaz is quite a bit better than her normal ditzy blonde persona, and there are many terrific supporting performances, especially by Liam Neeson and John C. Reilly.

","After all the delays, budget overruns and hype Gangs Of New York has become a film that seems as if it must be heralded as the last great film of the 1970s, albeit one with the shocking punctuality to arrive 20 years late, or three hours of ponderous nonsense. Given time these extreme views will settle down somewhere in the middle but no-one can be bothered with such mundane notions so soon after the film's release.<br/><br/>Gangs Of New York follows a boy called Amsterdam who swears to avenge his Father's murder at the hands of Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting. Twenty years of film time later, and three hours of real time, later he finally gets around to fighting him, and that is pretty much the entirety of the plot. There are some characters who die along the way, Cameron Diaz appears as a love interest and the entirety of New York gets levelled in a riot, but all of that seems fairly incidental.<br/><br/>It comes as no surprise that the project that Martin Scorsese has been harbouring for 20 years is about crime and power, themes he has been exploring his whole career. What is remarkable is the way he carves such a compelling tale out of what is essentially a spectacularly long game of who will blink first. Despite moving at what seems like an elegiac slow motion the film never drags and every shot oozes style.<br/><br/>The sets and costume are particularly well crafted but it is the lives and deaths of the characters that dominate the film. Leonardo Di Caprio turns in a focussed and restrained performance which bears the narrative weight of the film with great maturity, and hopefully signals a return to form for the over hyped star. It is Daniel Day Lewis who steals the film with his portrayal of the psychotic Bill The Butcher. Whilst there is a touch of ham in the acting to match the overpowering array of butcher references that surround the character he seems to be opening snorting at the pantomimish antic that Anthony Hopkins has reverted to in his portrayals of Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>Many will find the films lack of blockbuster qualities disappointing and there is a definite lack of scope on display. Those looking for musing on love, life and the whole damn thing may find the film shallow and obsessed with violence and those seeking the memorable dialogue of Goodfellas and Taxi Driver will go home without a single catch phrase to retell to their friends. Instead Scorsese has crafted a wondrous cinematic depiction of pride and determination to a cause with a blindness to the world around it, and in this way Gangs Of New York is a towering achievement."

","*SPOILER ALERT*<br/><br/>All the build-up/hype/reviews I've seen for this movie have been about whether Scorsese, greatest American director etc, can overcome various production difficulties and deliver a masterpiece. I have to say, I let all that boring commentary wash over me, waited for the movie to open and bought my ticket.<br/><br/>It starts bloodily, the crisp white snow in New York's Five Points becoming stained with the blood of dozens of men slain in a battle between rival gangs - the immigrants (led by Liam Neeson's Priest Vallon) versus the naturalized New Yorkers (led by Daniel Day-Lewis's Bill the Butcher). The idea, in the modern world, that there is any such thing as a native New Yorker in a city founded by immigrants, populated by descendents of immigrants, is fanciful. But in NYC in 1846, it was a reason for significant and regular bloodshed.<br/><br/>Anyway, the Priest's son, played as a grown-up by Leonardo DiCaprio, emerges from an institution fifteen or sixteen years after he is orphaned to avenge his father and kill the marble-eye wearing Butcher who put him there. Vallon Jnr infiltrates the Natives' inner-circle and falls for Cameron Diaz, who turns out to be connected to his father's killer.<br/><br/>The movie builds to its inevitable climax slowly, but every second is fascinating. Some have criticized the indulgent run time - just short of three hours does seem excessive on paper - but the characters are all well drawn and each has an identifiable personality. I loved the realism, the detail and the craft that invests every scene and every shot. It's vivid, realistic and human through all the sets, costumes, dialogue and characters.<br/><br/>
There was some disquiet about the closing third featuring two distinct story lines (the corruption and unfairness leading to the 1862 draft riots and the quest for revenge by young Vallon) that Scorsese never quite manages to marry together. I disagree, feeling instead that they are absolutely part of the same period and mentality. Seeing the whole city explode in to violence and dissent towards the end is an attempt by the director to explain the drive of the gangs, and the fact that anyone repressed and unloved is on the precipice of violence. These men and women, he is saying, are what some of us could have been had we lived 140 years ago. Don't look down on them, he pleads. Understand why they did what they did - because, identically to the draft rioters, they felt they had no alternative. Corruption, inequality and social exclusion give the down-trodden little reason to respect their laws and institutions.<br/><br/>For sure, you can sit through the movie and notice parts that should have been cut, but this director is a craftsman and I haven't ever looked at a painting and complained that the artist should have cut three inches from the border because it's too big. Trust Scorsese to include what he feels is right - the result is a stunning, epic history of the America that gave birth to all our lives."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** An overlong, unfocused, too broadly played costume drama.  At times I expected the cast to break out into dance, like the Sharks and Jets of Westside Story. That's too bad because this episode in American history is one that really needed telling. Warning, spoiler follows.<br/><br/>
Historically, the film is remarkable in that it accurately portrays the New York City working class' violent opposition to the Lincoln administration during the War for Southern Independence. At one point in the movie, as the caskets of dead New Yorkers are piled up on the docks, a large crowd chants, ""New York should secede!"" ""New York should secede!"", which has to be the most politically incorrect movie segment of the past several decades.<br/><br/>In another scene Irish immigrants who have been in the U.S. for only a few days are told to sign one piece of paper that grants them citizenship and another one that enrolls them in the Union army. They are completely unaware of their fate: One immigrant asks, ""Where are we going?"" ""Tennessee"" is the answer, to which he responds: ""Where's that?"" These men were to go down south to ostensibly teach the grandchildren of Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry what it really means to be an American. Thousands of them would be slaughtered after being ordered by General Ulysses S. Grant to charge into Robert E. Lee's well-entrenched army.<br/><br/>The climax of the movie is the New York City draft riots of July 1863. The government began enforcing Lincoln's conscription law, accurately depicted in a newspaper headline in the film as ""The First Federal Conscription Law."" The wealthy Republican industrialists and bankers who were the backbone of the Republican Party saw to it that Lincoln's conscription law would spare their own male children by allowing one to buy one's way out of the draft for $300. This led to violent protests against the inequity of ""a rich man's war.""<br/><br/>In mid July of 1863 potential draftees went on a weeklong rampage, targeting the houses and property of the Republican Party elite of New York City. New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley, who had become a Republican Party mouthpiece, is shown running for his life from a dinner party at a palace-like residence in the good part of town as the draft protesters break the windows and loot the house. As Iver Bernstein wrote in The New York City Draft Riots, ""Rioters tore through expensive Republican homes on Lexington Avenue and took - or more often destroyed - pictures with gilt frames, elegant pier glasses, sofas, chairs, clocks, furniture of every kind.""<br/><br/>Another perfectly accurate portrayal is the hunting down and murdering of any and all black people who were unfortunate enough to be on the streets of New York. Since Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation had recently declared emancipation to be a purpose of the war, the draft protesters vented their hatred for Lincoln and his war on the hapless black people of New York City. There are scenes in the movie of black men being beaten to death and lynched, which once again is perfectly accurate.<br/><br/>Just as realistic is the scene where thousands of federal troops are called up from the recently concluded Battle of Gettysburg and ordered to fire indiscriminately into the crowds. Hundreds of unarmed draft protesters, including women and children, are gunned down and are shown lying dead in the streets. This really happened, and is well documented in Bernstein's book and elsewhere, but most Americans have never heard of it (naturally). Gunships are also shown bombarding the parts of the city where the rioting was taking place.<br/><br/>It's too bad that these immigrants and working class didn't have politically savvy organizers.  Had the draftees realized that few would return they might have correctly surmised that the enemy was the State and the wealthy and turned their guns against their commanding officers."

","I absolutely disagree with all those peoples considering GANGS OF NEW YORK a minor Scorsese's movie.  Scorsece had created different kinds of masterpieces on different subjects, and also some failures ( which is not the case).<br/><br/>After the incredible filmed and orchestrated beginning battle, seems start to look rather conventional (Father killed, son looking for revenge), but a few minutes later, you realize that things are a lot more complicated than originally seemed. That the story keeps twisting every time, because the main characters (specially THE BUTCHER played by Day-Lewis) are three dimensional human beings so it is not to easy to judge them as saints or evil. However, with all the moral ambiguities growing every second, the  story is just an excuse to glue several historical facts (as the infamous CONSCRIPTION DRAFT), to tell the chronicle an important part of a young nation, but most of all, to make the MOST IMPORTANT STATEMENT ABOUT RACISM ever delivered (Jewish were not the target here  and even Black people were not the main focus; just Europeans against Europeans). <br/><br/>
Is very hard to accept that most of the blood splatter on the birth of this nation was related to racial issues.  My feeling (based on the last scene which clearly show the TWIN TOWERS) is that Scorsece is making an analogy between past and present events. It will be up to each viewer to agree or argue that.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not perfect, but with a running time of  more than two hours and a half, some things could fail. One of them is the uninteresting love story between Amsterdam(Di Caprio ) and Jenny (Diaz).  Probably the only conventionalism in the movie, the lack of passion in the two scenes together is something I blame more to the Director than the actors. <br/><br/>Scorsece eliminated any moment of erotic or sexual tension between these two characters when the first scene together was so promising . Probably as a compensation, he kept lots of breast (not full nudity only breasts) on other gratuitous scenes.  There was a matter of MPAA rating (I heard that the European version is longer and a lot more sexual), which is another stupid thing. I don't think kids below 17 could be interested or should see this movie, then what is the reason to cut it ?.<br/><br/>Performances, are a mixed bag. Daniel Day Lewis is SUPERB and Oscar worthy. Just a notch down are Liam Neeson, Jim Broadbent, John C Reilly and Brendan Gleeson; all of them creating ambiguous characters.  Di Caprio, does a good job, and is not miscast as many people believe, but his character has not many more possibilities.

After a bloody and horrifically realistic opening battle, the gang warfare festers on in simplistic Protestant vs Catholic rabble-rousing fashion whilst Di Caprio, Diaz and Daniel Day-Lewis all take turns to sparkle a bit. Scorsese shines with wasted talent throughout and the film will no doubt pick up the odd minor Oscar or two for misdirected effort. Mainstream fodder that ought to be something more than the sum of its pretensions."
"Suzie True","8","0","0","19 January 2003"," An ambitious film, flawed but breathtaking
","While watching, I was riveted by the scenes, the violence, the costumes. Yes, Bill the Butcher did become rather exaggerated, but a delightfully wicked character with such a wide variety of mannerisms and facial expressions. I thought Di Caprio's character did pale in comparison, but that is mostly the fault of the writing and partially the fault of the rest. If he is a man of few words, then make his inner struggle more apparent on screen, make his pain evident. Yet he seemed like an intelligent character, so give him more lines. Simple solution to white splace.<br/><br/>Then there was that problem with his motivation - it got lost 2/3 through the film. The cliched plot was actually acceptable against the backdrop of such a melee of things going on, but it could have been more unique. I did think the Diaz subplot kind of unnecessary. Was the point to get aroused and horrified at the same time and then feel guilty about it later? Don't know.<br/><br/>Worth watching, however, just to see on screen a depiction of events that never sunk in in history class, and feel emotions associated with it. There were no heroes in this film. That is the point."

","This is a really, really good movie...and perhaps even a great one. For the life of me I can't understand why so many people here are trashing it, but I can certainly see why over a thousand voters have rated it a 10 out of 10. As has been repeatedly noted, Daniel Day-Lewis steals the film in one of the most bravura performances of the decade. Diaz is excellent and shows a capability for real dramatic acting that is a treat. DiCaprio is at least good, perhaps even very good.  The best of a solid supporting cast is Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed.  In over two and a half hours the pace never drops, and you are actually not conscious of the length. There's quite a bit of blood, gore and violence which might be a problem for the squeamish, and the historical accuracy leaves a bit to be desired (the gang costumes are actually somewhat reminiscent of the great 70's film The Warriors), but all in all, this is wonderful, classic Scorcese, and definitely worth seeing."

","""Gangs of New York"" was a fascinating movie.  It recounts the brutal culture of street thugs and immigrants in 19th century New York.  Leonardo DiCaprio's Amsterdam Vallon of the Dead Rabbits squares off against Daniel Day-Lewis' Bill the Butcher of the Native Americans.  I thought it was interesting to see how street thugs back then used such brutal but sophisticated weaponry and fighting tactics.  The movie isn't exactly historically accurate.  I went in already knowing a little something about the gangs of old New York.  I could recognize names and characteristics. Anyway, the movie was a huge vision of pain and beauty.  Day-Lewis played his part well, even if his broad New York accent and cartoonish stovepipe hat made his performance seem absurd.  Overall, ""Gangs of New York"" was great, a true product of Martin Scorsese."

","Gangs of New York is not the masterpiece it might have been for all the ingredients it mixes. But the mixture is not so good. Worse, it's kind of a very impersonal movie Scorsese finally gave us.<br/><br/>
Main Flaws<br/><br/>On the whole Gangs of New York lacks pace. Yet it has stamina: you never get bored as it delivers some really good scenes and something pretty interesting in between. The main plot involving DiCaprio's revenge is low-keyed by all the hysterico-historical background. True there is a crescendo involving the mid-19th century NY and its social unrest. But the focus on DiCaprio's dilemma suffers from it; it suffers all the more as Daniel Day 'The Butcher' chops most of the scenes to his will. And we don't really feel DiCaprio's inner life, that of a man who shall have no relief until his father is avenged.<br/><br/>Perhaps Scorsese was compelled by the Weinstein siblings to edit out a lot of stuff (I heard the rough cut ran 220 min). Hence I hope there will be a masterpiece of a Director's cut opening some day in home theatres. For what I saw it's either an ill fated masterpiece or a proof Scorsese just can't direct costume epics or shoot tragedies out of his usual Italo-American background.<br/><br/>EVERYBODY OWES, EVERYBODY PAYS - eventually there are too many owners and they all share the credit for this lukewarm mega-production."

","One really gets a sense of the epic historical masterpiece that Scorsese was trying to produce, but unfortunately he does not pull it off.

","A sprawling, brawling mass of characters and ideas that will be remembered more for the hype and history of its production than for the history it depicts.<br/><br/>Though the movie's scope and intentions are commendable, there's too much forced intimacy between protagonists and not enough about the actual gangs and how they coexisted (or not, as is the actual case). Love interest Cameron Diaz is only interesting when she's picking pockets, but otherwise an utter waste of time. Sadly, DiCaprio's lack of charisma makes him an unconvincing lead and ultimately scuppers the enterprise.<br/><br/>And Daniel Day-Lewis? Oh, he's something else. But I just couldn't take him seriously. His crazy moustache and permanent squint so closely resembled that of Laurel and Hardy regular James Finlayson (who usually played Ollie's father-in-law or similarly cantankerous foil) that I was itching for him to turn to the camera with a well-timed `Doh!'<br/><br/>Which neatly sums up Gangs Of New York Â– a fine mess."
"ZosoJade","7","0","0","16 January 2003"," Scorsese's worst
","While certainly not a bad film, this is undoubtedly my least favourite Scorsese movie (well,out of the ones I've seen). I was so excited when I heard about the film and the actors because I do actually feel DiCaprio is not a bad actor in general and he's not bad in this either. The problem with this film, I think is the plot. All it is is one guy kills other guy's dad, years later first guy takes his revenge. That's it. There is no more to this story. Does Scorsese not realise that this is the story of The Lion King? Does he not understand how ridiculously unoriginal the film is?<br/><br/>So I hear you ask - how come the film is a whopping 2hrs and 45 mins long? Because to make up for the lack of anything to do in the story Scorsese tries to put in every random event that happened in that period into the film despite the fact they have little to do with the plot. What was the point in going on about the drafts for so long. Amsterdam himself says that none of the gangsters were going to be drafted so why do we keep hearing about these things that have nothing to do with the characters? Why go on and on about the riots when none of the people we have been introduced to are taking part?<br/><br/>However like I said earlier this film is not bad. The battle scenes while sometimes grotesque are epic and worth the watch. Day-Lewis's De Niro impression is spot on as well and he is quite a good bad guy. Be warned however, this film is severely depressing. My friends and I walked in with intentions to go for  a drink afterwards. However, by the end of the film we all felt so down we all just went to bed."

","It took 2 viewings to promote this film from being very good (the 1st time)...to being great! (2nd time). And an example of fine film making. An astute reviewer once said of John Ford's ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" (1962) that it was panned upon it's original release, but all Ford scholars now regard it as an American classic. I wouldn't be surprised if, down the road, history sheds light and provokes the same reaction among film scholars toward Scorsese's epic.<br/><br/>Towering above the grand and detailed setting of mid 19th century New York (""Noo Yawk"") is Daniel Day Lewis. His performance as William Cutting (a walking nightmare of Charles Dicken's most unscrupulous characters, complete with stovepipe hat and gangling stride) is the most electrifying I've seen in years. He is both charismatic and cruel. Symbolic, yet seemingly spontaneous. It's hard to believe that this is the same actor from 'My Left Foot' and 'Last of the Mohicans', to name just two. It's difficult to not be in awe of his chameleon capabilities. If he decides to stay in semi-retirement, his place in acting history is still immortalized. It is we, the rest of the world, that will be the loser.<br/><br/>DiCaprio (very believable, more so than 'Titanic') and Diaz perform just fine to create a compelling conflict. You feel their characters wallowing in a dirty, disgusting environment with just enough pride to raise their heads above the muck of life in 1862 to survive with a sense of honor. This is not a world you'd want to walk in without a clothes pin over your nose.<br/><br/>Lifting elements from 'The Bowery'(1933) and especially Sergio Leone's 'Once Upon A Time In The West'(1969), Scorsese successfully creates a fictional story of revenge against the backdrop of Five Points that led to the 4 day Draft Riots of the Civil War. After watching this, it's ""Thank you! Thank you!"" for being born in the 20th century.<br/><br/>Not for all tastes, especially if you're looking for clean cut, sympathetic characters with fine pressed shirts.<br/><br/>Still...I wonder if the director has his own cut to be released on dvd that won't be hampered by theater showtime restrictions. Some story lines could have been further fleshed out.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie, I picked up 'Last of the Mohicans' on dvd (with DTS sound...what a bonus). And I'm still captivated by Day Lewis' performance. Selfishly, I hope his cobbler business goes under.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 !"

Amsterdam is, as Bill keeps reminding us, just a kid! That is why (spoilers ahead) there cannot be any great showdown between them, because Bill would have to kill Amsterdam. But he won't, as in the really horrible 'scar' and hatchet scene! Amsterdam, unlike his father, is not a worthy victim of the great Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting.

"princy","6","0","0","15 January 2003"," Has Scorcese sold out?
","This movie is a sad sign of the times. If you compare this film with any of Scorcese's  other work you will notice some remarkable differences.  Gone is the gritty realism which has been a trademark of his work, and replaced by formulaic acting and storyline. I mean could you really compare the comic book character of Daniel Day Lewis to anything DeNiro has done in Scorcese's films? As for the obligatory  love interest between DiCaprio and Diaz, Scorcese has never resorted to using romance as a filler to pad-out the story  in his films before.  As for the performances of these two actors, Leo was mediocre  as usual, and Diaz was only slightly better.<br/><br/>What this movie did for me was re-affirm the direction Hollywood film-making has taken in the last few years.  In order to reach the mass market, many Hollywood movies are being pitched at a very low level and as a result films such as  Titanic, Pearl Harbor, and Gladiator are churned out.  These films achieve the desired goal of earning mega-dollars at  the box office, but as a result are made up of uncomplex storylines, stereotypes, and two dimensional characters. When you compare these movies with films such as The Godfather or Silence of the Lambs which were complete with characters and storylines of depth and complexity,  it is easy to see from here the direction Hollywood is taking.<br/><br/>What this movie also re-affirms for me is a suspicion that Hollywood is buying up award votes.   Apart from receiving a Golden Globe nomination for best picture, Cameron Diaz has also been nominated for her part.  Her Golden Globe nomination (and I'm sure an Oscar nomination will follow) is right up there with  Nichole Kidman (Moulin Rouge), Gwyneth  Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love), and Marissa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny) as one of the most undeserving nominations given to a female actress.  As a result, I am convinced that this movie will go along the same tracks as other ""simple-minded"" movies such as Titanic and Gladiator where it will be showered with Academy Award Nominations that it clearly won't deserve.<br/><br/>If this movie had been made by any other director I would have brushed it off with a laugh, but the fact that it was directed by Scorcese is sad.  Was he only complying with studio heads in order to make this film? I only hope this is a one off for Scorcese.  I would hate to think that the likes of Taxi Driver and Goodfellas will not be seen again. All being said, at least foreign films are still being made where they they are driven by the characterizations rather than a lame plot. I can still watch them."

","Of all the films to be released this year, I am hard pressed to find one that had been bad mouthed as much as GONY. That being said, Its very hard for people to look at this from a clean point of view. Going in without expectations, without tainting your mind with the bad press and negative feelings, will yield a truly rewarding cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Those of us who are Scorsese experts, know that most of his movies take time more then anything to find the appropriate response/audience. His work is very dense, and specialized. Marty doesnt make films that cater to the masses. However i think masses of people would appreciate his films if they are given the time and emotional justice.<br/><br/>Simply put, this movie cannot be consumed right away. I have seen it four times, and am still not willing to fully put my stamp on it. I am certain it is in my top ten, but just how certain...i do not know...<br/><br/>Obviously there are weak points, the plot yes. But is that the reason we came to this movie?  The films enemies are going to find any excuse they can to whine about the experience...<br/><br/>I think the story works,  but i wouldnt go so far as to call it a story based movie. Its a simple matter of compromise. Many plot driven films seem to compromise character and emotional signifigance. Gangs of New York is a movie that should be seen, and seen, and seen...and talked about 5 years from now.<br/><br/>I suppose this is why i find myself going back and watching scorsese's movies the most. Everytime there is some new element at work. Some new piece of emotion, or design that i didnt see before.<br/><br/>That is the beauty of a scorsese film, and hes done some of his best work here.<br/><br/>on a side note.

","Martin Scorsese's long awaited dream project, Gangs of New York, was well worth the wait. The nearly three hour film is breathtaking in its scope and attention to detail, immersing the viewer completely in the brutal streets of 1860s New York City.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio turns in a solid performance as Amsterdam Vallen, a young man who is bent on revenging his father's murder. Although his Irish accent is sometimes a little shaky, DiCaprio proves here that he is more than the matinee idol that most people think he is. His Amsterdam is brooding and haunted, the fire of rage present in every move he makes.<br/><br/> In her most serious role yet, Cameron Diaz gives a well-rounded turn as Jenny Everdeane, a gutsy pickpocket. Diaz is an actress of extreme beauty, and she uses it to her advantage here. Her Jenny is a damaged woman, with scars on the outside and on the inside. She is filled with humor and also has the grit and instinct needed to survive. Unfortunately, Diaz nearly disappears in the film's last forty-five minutes, as the revenge plot takes center stage. She manages to make the most of her rather truncated screen time, and in doing so creates a woman that the audience cares about.<br/><br/>Also very impressive is Jim Broadbent as the corrupt politician Boss Tweed. Broadbent, who won an Oscar last year for his remarkable work in Iris, is one of the best character actors working today. He is nearly unrecognizable as Tweed, and gives the character an oily charm that makes the viewer both revile and like him.<br/><br/>Towering above everything and everyone is Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher. Day- Lewis makes Bill the most utterly cinematic character to grace the silver screen in many years, terrifying even as he fascinates. His monologue to Amsterdam in the middle of the film, delivered while draped in an American flag, is a stunning piece of acting, and shows a deep and infinitely complex characterization. With his stove-pipe hat, enormous moustache, and glass eye, Bill is a murderous and charismatic leader. Towards the end of the film, as Bill and Amsterdam circle one another, it is difficult to decide who you want to win.<br/><br/>Scorsese's Gangs is an unqualified triumph, and one wishes that it were even longer than three hours. If the film does not win Best Director, and Actor for Day-Lewis at the Oscars this year, it will be a supreme and unforgivable injustice."

"raysond","Null","0","0","10 January 2003"," A sprawling epic not to be missed
","Martin Scorsese's long awaited epic ""The Gangs of New York"" clocks in at 168 minutes,but it is one of the grandest epics that you will see anywhere else and also this will be the year that the director of such classics as ""Mean Streets"",""Taxi Driver"",""Raging Bull"",""Goodfellas"", and ""Kundan"" will finally win the Oscar for Best Director. As for the movie itself,it's a violent sprawling epic set in the early 1860's in an area of Lower Manhattan known as Five Points,a wretched neighborhood sullied by routine bloodshed,police brutality,political corruption,seething ethnic tensions and rampant lawlessness. But as for the film in general,it would have been benefited from some serious trimming. If Scorsese had jettisoned the meandering subplots and underdeveloped characters,thereby lopping it off an hour or so,then ""Gangs"" might have been more of the potent picture it was meant to be and so forth.<br/><br/>On the other hand,""Gangs"",paradoxically,might have also benefited from being longer. Though it largely takes place in a confined location,""Gangs"" is a ambitious movie,and Scorsese's canvas is huge,rich,with thematic elements and historical ramifications. Another half-hour or more into the running time could have served to fill in the gaps. As it is,""Gangs"",despite its panoramic reach,is at heart a straightforward revenge tale,as well as old fashioned Western,with feuding immigrant groups,axes and cleavers in place of cowboys,Indians, arrows,and guns. Gussied up with Dante Ferreti's extraordinary production design and bogged down by a messy narrative,the movie shackles Leonardo DiCaprio(of ""Titanic"")in a one-note role which features a game but out-of-element Cameron Diaz,and relegates such fine actors as Liam Neeson,John C. Reilly,Henry Thomas,and Brendan Gleason to the background.<br/><br/>In the foreground,however,is Daniel Day-Lewis,and does he ever give the film some juice. Absent from the screen for six years(his last film was 1997's ""The Boxer"")he is a volcanic presence as William Cutting,better known as Bill The Butcher,a vicious gang leader who controls and rules all of Five Points. With his sideburns,upcurled mustache,greasy hair and stovepipe hat,the character could have come across as a caricature,and in some respects he does pull this one off brilliantly. But Mr. Day-Lewis swaggering,fericious performance somehow goes over-the-top yet remains rooted in reality. His flamboyantly chews up the scenary,plowing through caricature and transcending it to emerge as one of the most startling villains ever displayed on the screen.<br/><br/>From its opening sequence in 1846 that includes a brawl between Irish gangs and immigrants to the backdrop of the 1863 draft riots with the protest of the Civil War not to mention political corruption adds a foreground to the story and keeps it going strong. ""Gangs of New York"" is more than a triumph of atmosphere and production design than anything else. The film was shot at the legendary Cinecitta Studios in Rome,and the Five Points set looks like a set to make it realistic. Yet the meticiously realized neighborhood,with its melting pot of accents and outdated slang,its saloons and floozies,its murderers and thieves,its poverty and filth and abandoned children is a character unto itself. Scorsese has crafted a robust movie that,from moment to moment,is powerful and sometimes pulses with vitality,but the picture gets away from him. Still,there are enough impressive moments to recommend this movie which is one of the year's best films. It will be interesting to watch during the Oscar ceremonies to see if Daniel Day-Lewis,who tour-de-force should put him at the front of the Oscar for Best Actor race and Scorsese for Best Director,not to mention Best Picture."

","Ok, I have a serious bone to pick here. One of the main complaints I've heard was how ""overly long"" Gangs of New York was and how ""absolutley nothing happened"" until the end. I'm sorry, but I must have missed the meeting where a film that doesn't fit within a digestable 2 hours or under is a piece of crap. Keep in mind that films like Taxi Driver are largely regarded as classics, but that film could have ended sooner as well. Imagine this, Travis Bickle, instead of going slowly insane, decides to ""save"" the young prostitute sooner, the film ends an hour and twenty minutes in, credits roll. The entire power of that film would seem meaningless. What the hell did you expect from this movie? This is Martin Scorsese, you should know you are not going to get an average, black-and-white, hero and villain tale here. He doesn't see things that way. Would you have rather have seen Amsterdam and Bill struggling through the city of New York, dropping their weapons and reaching for new ones, all the while escaping shrapnel from the cannons Matrix style? For Christ's sake people, what are you thinking? This isn't a film about revenge, looking at that way is like saying that Lawrence of Arabia is about the desert. In other words, you're wrong for looking at it that way. Revenge was only the setup for Bill and Amsterdam to meet as adults, and the ensuing relationship and confrontations are the product of all those long hours that you ""wasted."" Nothing happened?? Am I the only one here who saw the fire and absolute intensity leaping off the screen in the character of Bill the Butcher?? So not as many fights happened as you'd like, maybe Scorsese wanted to take his time in creating real characters before sending them out to die, please, exscuse him. If you don't appreciate this film, that's your loss, not mine. Perhaps I saw a different film, because the audience I saw this film with sat in silence long after the credits began to roll, and stayed that way until reaching the parking lot. It was almost as if we had experienced a trauma, shell shocked, we must have looked strange to those waiting in line eagerly for other films. Your opinions are your own, and that applies to me to.

","I waited all year for Gangs of New York.  Fortunately, it was more than I expected.  I'm not a huge Leo fan.  To date, his best work was in, What's Eating Gilbert Grape.  But, he was great in GoNY, no Daniel Day-Lewis, but great nonetheless.  Cameron Diaz played a fine character and was as gorgeous as she was convincing.  Dialogue is well written with choice humor. Violence??  GoNY gives Braveheart a run.<br/><br/>There are many subplots to follow in this film.  Cocks and Scorsese do an incredible job of weaving them in as well as keeping the off-screen action alive.  You never forget and can't wait to get back to each one.<br/><br/>Although there is some sketchy editing, the direction and cinematography are on fire.  From the first scene, the squalor of the time is with you. Throughout the film you notice it in every board, brick and pane.  Scorsese always captures and holds a moment.  Gives you time to think about where you are.  GoNY is no exception.  A few shots stuck with me for days.  Watching the Irish men come off a ship, get their US citizenship, enlist in the war, then board a ship to Tennessee as it offloads the bodies of dead soldiers was perfection.  That single scene is genius.<br/><br/>Historically, it was well done.  There seems to bee a good amount of wiggle room when it comes to the facts but I believe them to be represented here. A couple of books to pick up for more info are: Gangs of New York by Asbury and Five Points by Anbinder.<br/><br/>See this film.  Make your own call."

","i'm really not sure about most imdb commenters. they seem to me to be very bitter about that fact that they don't make movies, and trash those who do. 'gangs of new york' reviews are in a similar vein. while some commnetors have been fair, many have said it was boring and predictible. i have little time for these people. this film is amazing. nothing has ever looked like this or felt like this. you never knew what to expect, and i was captivated. i couldn't tear my eyes from the screen and the time flew by. of course the main narritive points were of revenge, and we know that at some stage amsterdam (leo) will attempt to kill bill. however, the hows and whens of this are what intrigues us. moreover, there is a statement about violence here. it is only with the use of brute violence that order and control can be exercised. in the end, the american forces only manage to subdue the angry mobs and gain control of bills territory. it's a fascinating film, with wonderful production values and a fantastic story. the acting is fantastic by all. definitely one to watch."

"zengun","Null","0","0","10 January 2003"," terrible casting, wrong-headed artistic concept
","You know those ads where they smash up a brand new car to demonstrate how safe it is? It catches your attention, but also makes you feel a little sick for the waste of a perfectly good car. But what about a director, a pure artist, who has such resources? Dead bodies, stabbed, crushed, burning and bleeding bodies are not in themselves amusing. The purpose of civilization (and it's voice of reason, ART) is to *attempt* to shift our gaze from the ugliness which underlies human existence, toward the bigger and higher picture of human aspirations. (At least in my opinion.) This movie attempts the opposite. Even if New York weren't a renowned stinkhole anyway, we hardly want to know about the stinking horror that was its real history, do we? If we did, we'd all be researching history and trading pictures of mutilated corpses. (Oh, maybe Hollywood movie moguls live in a more serene world, perhaps that's it.) Anyway there is no higher purpose or vision in this movie. The difference between this and a gory slasher flick is that most slasher flicks have a sense of humor and don't take themselves seriously. This movie takes itself seriously ... though in a stupid, Hollywood way, e.g. DiCaprio's face remains miraculously pretty, no matter how much it is slashed and burned.<br/><br/>On the seriously negligent casting: Any sane movie buff would balk at casting Leonardo DiCaprio as an Irish street thug. Even if he's buffed up and scarred up, it isn't him and it isn't ever going to be him. Maybe he has a range (tho Brad Pitt he is not) but it doesn't lie in that direction. Just as bad is Cameron Diaz in a role w/o a hint of humor. What a waste! Imagine her overly mobile face covered with grime and blood looking horribly distressed, over and over ad nauseum. Cripes! She isn't nearly as cute as I thot she was. Her face is sort of squashed down, her mouth is way too big. DiCaprio bores me anyway, but too bad to see a free spirit like her become an ugly Julia Roberts wanna be."

","Yes, the King is indeed dead.  Hate to say it about one of the greatest filmmakers of our time, but you can stick a fork in him.  A younger Scorsese would've realize the more compelling story belonged to Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis) and NOT the horribly underwritten Amsterdam (DiCaprio).  The writing is abysmal.  How and why Weinstein and Scorsese spent all that money to make this script is beyond me.  It tries to squeeze in as many historical tidbits as possible (why didn't he just make a documentary and be done with it?), it uses almost every cliche in the book in hopes we'll be overwhelmed by their abundance (a la Titanic), and the story is simply not compelling enough for the marathon running time.  The story, or what story there is, is merely an afterthought, a backdrop to the backdrop of New York at the cusp of the Civil War.  Day-Lewis is the only bright spot here, easily stealing every scene he's in, creating a uniquely flawed but sympathetic and honorable antagonist.  He's a great actor, period.  Dicaprio is serviceable, although he could do without the tough-guy routine; it doesn't suit him. (Spielberg used him much better in ""Catch Me If You Can."")  Diaz is in over her head; she should stay away from period pieces.  I was longing for Gwyneth Paltrow; that's how bad she is.  John C. Reilly is barely in it, and when he is, I've never see him worse.  In his defense (along with DiCprio an Diaz), he had nothing to work with.  And the direction is all over the place, as if Scorsese forgot that good stories are about people, not places. It's so uneven and sloppy I almost walked out.  I'd rather watch ""Jenny Got Cancer"" on Lifetime.  Yep, it's been almost 13 years since his last good film, Goodfellas.  The fat lady is at the mic and the band's about to play.<br/><br/>NOTE TO MARTY:  Make small, personal, independent movies again, stupid! And get Bobby in there if you can.

","In 1846 New York City, the native gangs and the foreign (mostly Irish) gangs meet to fight an awful battle for supremacy.  The natives are victorious and the Irish leader, Priest Vallon, is slain by the terrible Bill Cutting. Vallon's son, Amsterdam, is dispatched to an orphanage and emerges in 1862 to find most of his Irish fellows subjugated (but cared for) by Bill and his native gang.  Amsterdam joins Bill's gang and begins to rise through the ranks.<br/><br/>The United States' stories of its own creation have almost invariably been Westerns.  GANGS OF NEW YORK pioneers a needed new genre: the Eastern. Without the East, there would have been no conquest of the West.  Some of the most famous figures in the history of the West were actually Easterners, such as a New York City boy named Henry McCarty who moved to Arizona and became known as Billy the Kid.  As this movie demonstrates, the West had no monopoly on lawlessness and violence.  The 19th century East also deserves its larger-than-life heroes and villains, and GANGS OF NEW YORK tries to fill that need.<br/><br/>The movie duly sets about creating the atmosphere and archetypes which will inhabit the land of the Eastern.  If Westerns are stories of ranches and railroads, then Easterns will be stories of cities and ships.  Just as the frontier landscape itself is a character in every Western, the city streets of New York itself live and breathe in this Eastern (kudos to Scorsese for shunning CGI sets in favor of real ones wherever possible).  While the West is a place of vast empty spaces, home to the lonely Indian of Fraser's `The End of the Trail,' Scorsese's East is a teeming warren of pugnacious immigrant tribes stepping on each other's toes, with open warfare avoided only by a brutal pecking order where every man exacts his `due and proper' from the man below.  Patrick Buchanan ought to see this movie depict how his own Irish Catholic forbears were treated with the same anti-immigrant prejudice that he now directs against modern-day newcomers to America.<br/><br/>Another important part of the Eastern atmosphere is the language - `stargazer,' `turtledove,' `blodgett,' `dustup' -  that gives it a unique sense of time and place.  Not even the characters themselves understand all the local argot; when a gangster calls Amsterdam a `fiddling ben,' Amsterdam replies that he might be insulted if he knew what the epithet meant.  The soundtrack includes a number of enchanting songs; it is true that some are anachronistic and jarring, but even these are beautiful.<br/><br/>The outstanding creation of GANGS OF NEW YORK is its villain, Daniel Day Lewis's Bill Cutting, a butcher by trade who slaughters both pigs and human beings with unsentimental expertise.  Lewis's performance ought to garner him an Oscar and will be the standard by which future Eastern villains are judged.  Bill the Butcher is terrifying, sadistic, bigoted, and evil.  He is also brave, strong, and capable of real caring for his underlings.  He manifests genuine respect for his victim, Priest Vallon.  In one scene, he artfully suggests that a corrupt policeman's reluctance to do his bidding is as hypocritical as a butcher crying over a slaughtered rabbit.  Scorsese has certainly taken to heart Hitchcock's maxim that a movie can only be as good as its villain.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, GANGS OF NEW YORK is not quite as good as its villain, because it lacks a great hero to balance against him.  Leonardo DiCaprio does his best, and it is surprising how far his acting and his goatee go to toughen up his pretty-boy persona.  But Amsterdam is simply not a well-written protagonist.  He is impenetrable and uncompelling.  At the end of the movie, I understand no better why `the blood stays on the blade' than I did at the beginning.  Those who have seen Michael Corleone's voyage from good to evil will find Amsterdam's tribulations tedious and trite by comparison.<br/><br/>Also unsatisfactory is the lady lead, Cameron Diaz' Jenny Everdeane. Jenny is even more inscrutable than Amsterdam.  I could not understand what attracted her to Amsterdam, and evidently Amsterdam doesn't either. Again, this is not Diaz' fault; she acts what she is given superbly.  She just isn't given much.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is great.  Dominated by Lewis, it also features Jim Broadbent as Tammany Hall's Boss Tweed.  I ended up liking the politician Tweed more than most of the characters in the movie; he is corrupt and has no nobler motive than to line his own pockets, but at least he does so chiefly by helping the immigrants, not by stamping them down as others do. Other standouts are Liam Neeson as Amsterdam's father and Brendan Gleeson as Monk McGinn.<br/><br/>Perhaps the uninspired presentation of Amsterdam and Jenny, contrasted with the powerful portrayal of Bill, reflects an overall problem with American cinema: we have become fascinated with evil, and regard goodness as dull. This does not have to be so. (See LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL for a man who is good and who is also fascinating and delightful to watch).  Here is where Scorsese's Eastern has not yet matched the Western.  Westerns deal with ranchers raising cattle, cowboys driving them, laborers building railroads, sodbusters growing their crops, lawmen chasing down bank robbers; in short, people making the West a better place than they found it.  If the criminals in GANGS OF NEW YORK had anything to do with changing America from a fledgling colony into a superpower, Scorsese doesn't show it to us.<br/><br/>Scorsese presents us with a grand setting, populated by wonderful characters, on which little takes place besides senseless violence.  The movie is good, but I don't think many people will mistake it for great. Still, GANGS OF NEW YORK has launched the Eastern, and that is an important accomplishment.  Better plays will someday be performed on the stage that Scorsese has built here.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of ****.<br/><br/>Recommendation:  See it in the theater if you have a strong stomach for violence."

","Did Scorsese have a house payment due? Or has he become a Hollywood whore? This movie started out great, with a stunning battle, then morphed into sub-par dribble.

Though DiCaprio's character hardly hangs out with this dude, he and Diaz rush to his body after a battle, sobbing uncontrollably. Without character development, he is a token black guy. Why not have him be the turncoat instead of the happy-go-lucky shallow character he was.<br/><br/>2. Cameron Diaz as a feisty pick-pocket. How much do accent lessons really cost? I've heard better accents from my friends impersonating the Lucky Charms leprechaun. Wow, she is a bad actress. Give me an unknown good actress any day.<br/><br/>3. DiCaprio's presence.

"silverauk","7","0","0","13 January 2003"," historically not correct and politically correct?
","Jay Cocks, writer of the story, was more accurate in his historical vision in the other Scorcese movie about New York: The Age of Innocence. There is a difference of ten years between the two movies and you see in Gangs...and the later The Age of Innocence that New York has had a big transformation after the civil war. The Irish immigrants would continue to flow into the States until the end of the century and then the Chinese and Italian immigration started. However, there were no Chinese immigrants during the sixties!  So the presence of the Yellows-gang of Chinese is simply not possible. It is also not correct that there were blacks in the Irish gangs. Is this because the producer Harvey Weinstein wanted to give us a politically correct movie with the obliged percentage of blacks? The gang of the Dead Rabbits, to which Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) belonged, was originated from the Kerry Mountains, not far from Killarney in the South-West of Ireland.  The Irish, suffering from hunger and the holocaust by the English, fled to the States (from Baltimore in Ireland f.i.) in terrible circumstances which were hardly better than the slave transportation from West-Africa. Jenny Erverdeane (Cameron Diaz) looks too old for the Young Amsterdam but The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a good cast.  This movie should have been longer or shorter and not in between because the story has no time to develop and the end is too simple. We learn from this movie also that the civil war was not popular because so many soldiers died (especially immigrants were enrolled by an unfair allotment system ) or were mutilated."

","...and that was just Scorsese's directorial and editing choices. Probably one of the Top 5 Most Overrated Films of All Time. The film was choppy in any number of places and the feel of it changed throughout. The opening sequence, for instance, I thought I walked into the wrong theater. I had the odd feeling that I was watching `The City of Lost Children.' And every time there was an overhead view of the city or the Five Points neighborhood, it reminded me of the cheesy models used on Mr. Roger's Neighborhood.<br/><br/>(Throughout this film, I couldn't shake the image of Mandy Patinkin's character in ""The Princess Bride,"" Inigo Montoya, running around trying to avenge his father's death.)<br/><br/>One scene where DiCaprio and Diaz (yes, Cameron Diaz!) are walking and talking, there are so many POV cuts that it made my head hurt. Scorsese might as well have turned on a strobe light. It had the feel of a freshman communication student's first stab at a film.<br/><br/>Another instance was a scene in which P.T. Barnum's circus building was burning down and he sped up the action resulting in a look and feel only a fan of The Keystone Kops would enjoy.<br/><br/>And another glaringly bad choice was a mind-numbingly long sequence where all of the gangs, police, firemen and Union troops riot throughout the city. In order to convey to the audience how widespread the rioting was, Scorsese shot a quick scene of a telegraph machine spewing out its ticker tape and then ran a voiceover of what was being communicated as we see scene after bloody scene of mayhem. Except the actor who narrated the action sounded like the guy on M*A*S*H who did the P.A. announcements doing the play-by-play of a high school football game.<br/><br/>Another (good God, there's another one) sequence where DiCaprio and his gang realize the Irish vastly outnumber Day-Lewis' gang and his sphere of influence, so they put an Irishman up for election as sheriff. DiCaprio and his minions round up all of the Irish and make sure they've done their duty as Americans and vote as often as possible. This change of tone now felt like a comedic farce on a par with ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.""<br/><br/>Finally, there's this scene where I guess the audience is suppose to really understand how brutal this gang warfare is, but instead of an awe-filled reaction, most of us in the theater burst out laughing at the ludicrous way in which it was shot. Multiple slo-mo re-play angles of this guy falling dead to the ground until he, at long last, does.<br/><br/>The only reason I would urge someone to see this flick is to witness the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis. Probably the best character I've seen on film in at least ten years. A shoe-in for an Oscar. Other than that, Scorsese can't seem to decide if it's a romantic money-maker for fans of DiCaprio, a convoluted history lesson, or a three-hour-long feeble attempt at some deep, political statement. Unfortunately, it succeeds at all three, inferring that we haven't really changed in all these years and, at one point, even inserting a line of dialogue where somebody says, ""It's not the voters who get politicians elected, it's the vote counters."" Get it?<br/><br/>Spare me. And by all means, for the love of God, spare yourself. You'll thank me later.<br/><br/>-Tom Pacey"

"mjensen-3","8","0","0","12 January 2003"," Great film, but not one of Scorsese's best.
","Before I begin my review, I would like to say congratulations Martin Scorcese for adding yet another great film to your long career. This is the kind of film that doesn't hold anything back; the violence, the lifestyles these characters live, and like always Mr. Scorsese leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. What I mean by ""bad taste"" is the sinful images that this films evokes. The killing, the prostitution, the revenge are all sinful things.<br/><br/>THE PLOT<br/><br/>  The film starts in 1846 and ends in 1863 with the draft riots. The setting is New York's five points, the most violent part of the world at the time. The story is risen out of the conflicts between the whit Anglo-Saxon ""natives"" and the Irish immigrants coming into the five points. One boy needs to avenge the death of his father.<br/><br/>THE ACTORS<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the greatest natural actors that I've seen since Michael Keaton. Natural acting is getting into character but at the same time still being yourself; in other words you're infusing your own personality with the character your assigned to portray in the film.<br/><br/>Gary Cooper was a natural and so was Spencer Tracy. Leo's performance in this film is far better than ""Titanic."" In ""Gangs of New York"" Leo shows an unending rage that the audience has never seen before, in ""Titanic"" he's just a pretty boy. One of the problems with Leo's performance is that his accent comes and goes through out the film, just as Mel Gibson's accent did during ""Braveheart."" Mel wasn't nominated for best actor in ""Braveheart"" so I don't think Leo will get nominated for this movie for some of the same reasons, one being accent authenticity. However, I will expect a nomination for him in `Catch Me If You Can.' <br/><br/>  Daniel Day-Lewis's gives his best performance since ""My Left Foot."" Daniel has always shown the dark of every character that he's played and he incorporates some kindness and humanity as well in his performances.  <br/><br/>I expect an Oscar win for Daniel but Dennis Quaid presents immense competition in his performance in ""Far From Heaven.' Cameron Diaz has been giving terrible performances since ""Any Given Sunday"" but with ""Gangs Of New York"" she's proved her dramatic ability is still intact and is once again one of my favorite dramatic actresses.<br/><br/>
THE PROBLEMS<br/><br/>One of the problems with this film is the first battle scene. Every time Daniel Day-Lewis knifed someone there was no blood present. That's when I understood what Roger Ebert was talking about when he said, ""Scorsese didn't put all of his heart into this film."" I now know what he's talking about because you can tell Martin was not into this story because of his directing.  Usually Scorsese tells the story and keeps the audience interested with his directing. His directing carries all of his films, but in this film he lets the actors carry the film and not his directing. That's not Scorcese's style but that is Spielberg's style, Spielberg puts the camera or trails the camera with the actor and just lets them act; no fancy editing and barely any music. Spielberg's directing style is similar to David Lean's style in many ways. Scorsese is a dynamic director. He puts the camera between the actors; he uses music as he manipulates the scene constantly as he goes.... crazy with the camera. Sometimes he adds various types of lighting to his scenes to describe them, and he always uses slow motion via editing and camera work to go from actor to actor. His work is not static. In some films he uses a single tone to bring you into the scene. In ""Gangs of New York"" he forgot why he's famous in the first place. He forgot why people love him as a director and as an artist. In ""Kundun"" he changed his style purposely for the film and it was evident because he directs ""Kundun"" the way David Lean would direct ""Kundun"" using a similar style, and I expected that. I believe he directed ""Kunden"" the way he visualized it and the film worked. I felt no emotion when he is directing of ""Gangs of New York', because the emotion for the entirety of the film is carried by the actors. I was disappointed this by this movie for those reason I listed. My message to Scorsese is stick to what you know best and what you do best.... better than any other director. Scorsese did remember the fireworks. In every film of Scorsese there are fireworks.<br/><br/>I may be sounding negative about this very good film but  I liked it, so I rate ""Gangs of New York"" a 9 out of 10."

","Even after being withheld from the viewing audience for so long I was ready to give this movie the benefit of the doubt. Everything was clicking into place for the material to astound me. The costuming and cinematography were brilliant, the sets built by hand amazing, and the actors put on performances of a lifetime. The story was even involving despite the time old revenge thy family cliche. But then the movie got hit in the face by the romantic subplot. Theres nothing truthfully wrong with most of the romantic scenes in the film. There are the good scenes like Jennie nursing Amsterdam back to health after his mauling by Bill, or Amsterdams reaction to Bills little display of Knife Throwing using Jennie as his assisstant. But when the first scene started and the two began to bicker with each other, I knew exactly where this was headed; Jennie used to be Bill's girl!!! And suprise suprise Amsterdam some how becomes pigheaded in his treatment of her until one night of passionate lovemaking. To me if both of these plot points had been left out for more convential scenes of the two falling in love, the romance would have been a little less hard to swallow. As it is whenever Dicaprio and Diaz began bickering on the screen, I began to nod off in my chair.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie though, Scorecesse has directed the film which should definitely be up for the running in the best picture category this year. Everything mentioned before under his watchful eye smacks of perfectionism. The history while disjointed from the great book, is noticably applied in scenes. While no review would be complete with out mentioning Daniel Day-Lewis's brilliant portrail as Bill the Butcher. If he was not nominated this year for some kind of award, then it proves every single award for film is a sham."

","After many delays, production budget problems, problems on the set and so much more, Gangs of New York finally makes it to theaters. The movie looked to never to make it to theaters after having it opening day moved from December 2001 to February 2002 to July 2002 to arrive a week before Christmas Day 2002. The $100 million budgeted film was directed by one of the most famous directors in Hollywood, Martin Scorsese. Scorsese had the idea for this film nearly 30 years ago and now his vision is brought to life even after much strife. But will this be another masterpiece for the great director or will all the problems overwhelm the Miramax film?<br/><br/>The story goes that Amsterdam Vallon arrives in the city of New York after spending 16 years in jail. He once lived in the mean streets of New York before his father was killed by a man named Bill the Butcher, who fought to protect the rights of the ""natives"" of this country. Amsterdam joins the Butcher's group of ""natives"" and becomes very close to him. Along the way, he meets up with old friends who have either gone into hiding or joined the side of the ""natives"". Amsterdam soon makes the decision that the Irish immigrants can't live in such horrible conditions any longer and so goes after his father's killer for the sack of the people of America. The story of Gangs of New York is a neat one at that but by the end, the audience is way too confused. The historical aspect of the film would have been fine by itself but by adding the Amsterdam subplot, the stories get so jumbled together that it is unclear what is exactly going on.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is the second film for Leonardo DiCaprio to open around Christmas Day 2002 and he continues to show that he can't boast his acting ability outside of Titanic. The character of Amsterdam Vallon is way too complicated to fully understand but that is not the fault of DiCaprio. He does his best to make the audience accept as this Irish immigrant and he does a pretty good job at it. Daniel Day-Lewis was fabulous as Bill the Butcher. Lewis presents a great New York accent that makes him seem like a true American ""native"" in the 1860's. The only character that didn't seem in place was Cameron Diaz's Jenny. Once again, this is not the actor's fault but of the writer's. Diaz does a good job acting this character out but by the end of the film, her character seems very pointless to the story.<br/><br/>Overall, Gangs of New York was a big disappointment. Of the many problems, the thing that sticks out the most is the story. The era of the 1860's is a fascinating time to set a film against but the historical aspects are too jumbled together when that story is joined together with the Amsterdam Vallon story in Gangs. It was not much appreciated that the cause of the Union, which was to abolish slavery, was put in such a bad light. It is understood that many people didn't like the draft but some aspect to explain the draft should have been added. The government is looked on as a monster in this film which is not true at all. The film just seemed too dragged on. For three hours the movie looks to be going into one direction to just then turn around and go in another direction. Gangs' ending was too predictable. Scorsese could have saved at least a hour and a half of the audience's time by cutting out many unwanted scenes to direct straight to the bad ending. There are some things to like about Gangs of New York but they are so few that they not be mentioned here. See the film only if you really want to see it. If not, then wait for rental on DVD.<br/><br/>My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)"

Some stunning scenes were created on the back of his acting; for me it was the perfect marriage of character and actor. In comparison, DiCaprio was workmanlike and fairly flat, but not disastrous. Diaz, however, was a casting mistake - she made a promising character seem one-dimensional. <br/><br/>I feel the biggest problem with the movie is the questionable pacing. The final quarter in particular seems to fly by. The screenplay seemed to over-emphasise the personal affairs of Amsterdam (DiCaprio) to the detriment of the wider picture. However, this is one exciting looking movie, a real visual treat which belongs on the big screen. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie is somewhat inconsistent but has some memorable and powerful scenes; Daniel Day-Lewis adds huge value.

","Gangs of New York is one of the best films of 2002 thus far. Martin Scorsese delivered! Leonardo DiCaprio was great as the young, vengeful Amsterdam Vallon and Cameron Diaz as his love interest, the beautiful Jenny Everdeane. Aside from DiCaprio and Diaz, Daniel Day-Lewis was the one who really stole the show as the notorious William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting. However despite a number of historical accuracies in the film, Scorsese has credibly shown us one example of the early beginnings of mob violence in America. It showed us who was the real gangster behind the bloody street violence in the Five Points-Tammany Hall and that baby-kissing William ""Boss"" Tweed, portrayed well by Jim Broadbent. I also want to give a little inside information about the character of Daniel Day-Lewis. The real-life William Cutting was William Poole. Bill the Butcher was one of the gang bosses for the Bowery Boys in the lower east side of New York City (Manhattan). He was a butcher as well as a savage brawler and strongarm for xenophobic parties like the Native Americans and Know-Nothings.  If you are interested, Gangs of New York is the film to see."
"redfeather60","Null","0","0","5 January 2003"," A Frustrating Experience
","I found watching this movie to be a frustrating experience. On the one hand, it is a visual tour de force--a quality I would expect from a master filmmaker like Scorcese. It is also about an important, yet ugly, part of American history. Scorcese has masterfully recreated an entire era with painstaking detail that is a marvel to watch. The movie also has a great performance by Daniel Day Lewis and some great individual scenes.<br/><br/>On the other hand, however, my enjoyment of it was taken away by the horrendously loud volume level at which the movie was played. The sound system in the theater is probably one of the best in the country, yet, a good sound system does not have to be blasted to be enjoyed. So, watching the movie at home would have been more relaxing--a shame since it was made for the big screen.<br/><br/>I also found the narrative to be a jumbled mess. The characters could not have been more contrived. While The Butcher character was convincing, it could not have been written more theatrically. Instead of a movie that is trying to be everything--a romance, a history lesson, a revenge thriller--I would have enjoyed it much better if the scope would have been narrowed down a bit. I loved the historical aspect of the movie and the battle sequences. Yet, those aspects were undercut by the contrived plot, the ridiculously Hollywood treatment of the love story between De Caprio and Diaz and the familiar revenge theme. This is a shame since Scorcese can very well be a commercial director who doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator--but tragically he does so here.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie did not have the clarity and brilliant execution that Scorcese mastered in just about every other movie he's made, especially those bigger in scope like Goodfellas and Casino. That is too bad."

",":::CONTAINS SPOILERS::::<br/><br/>The idea behind this movie is great. It's about the wars between the Gangs that would later form the New York population. And for the most part, this is very well shown. Daniel-Day Lewis gives out an outstanding performance with Bill The Butcher, and the initial thought is that the movie is brilliant as well. However, there are some flaws, that fail to make this movie one of the best of the start of 2003. I don't have much against Leonardo Dicaprio's acting, but I said it, and I'll say it again, he fails to deliver the strong character he should. He isn't suited for this kind of role. Although he tries, some of his attempts to seem a rough rebellion often are somewhat amusing. Watch the scene when he eats an apple in a circle with his friend John. Sorry, but I made a grin during that one, even if it wasn't meant like that. Towards the ending, Scorcese somewhat overcomplicated things. The main idea was lost in the many different small happenings, such as John being a traitor, the small romance between Amsterdam and Jenny, etc. It distracts Amsterdam's hate towards Bill Cutting. Also, and I found this to be a tremendous shame, in the ending, when Amsterdam finally delivers Cutting to God, the blood is exaggerated. It wasn't as tasteful to see Cutting die while blood is flowing like a fountain over Amsterdam. Neither was it good for it to be a special moment, a moment of honor. All in all, the movie was good, and it without some mistakes, it was extraordinary. I give it a 7/10."

There's action, intrigue, romance, practically everything you want in a film.

Day-Lewis was the best of the entire cast. His portrayal of the character was extraordinary. He covers every aspect of Bill's mind, and gives an excellent performance. Diaz was what one would expect, alright but not brilliant. However, her Irish accent was half believable.<br/><br/>The movie itself, I think, is very good. If you enjoy historical movies and action, see this movie. It is violent, but the movie is called Gangs of New York, and of course it's going to be a tad gruesome in parts. However, it isn't overly gruesome for no good reason, that was just the time period.

"joel_wbs","10","0","0","4 January 2003"," Scorsese's ""Birth of a Nation""
","possible spoilers below (but I doubt it :)<br/><br/>
This is a stunning film that pulls no punches.  It will not appeal to all.<br/><br/>Is the movie violent? Yes, but not violent for only the sake of violence. To demonstrate my point, let's compare the opening scene in ""Gangs"" to that of ""Saving Private Ryan"".<br/><br/>Although overwhelmingly regarded to be an outstanding battle scene, ""Ryan"" seems to morbidly dwell on a catalogue of deaths and killings.  It documents one after the other after the other from an objective point of view. Scorsese's battle scene, on the other hand, is much more subjective.  We can feel what it is like to be in the middle of the battle, because everything - bodies, limbs, faces - blurs together.  We can hardly recognize who's killing or being killed at times.  We are confused, and that's what is so terrifying about hand-to-hand combat like this:  You don't know who's coming up behind you as you are killing somebody else.<br/><br/>In Spielberg's film, we know what it's like to see from a third person perspective someone getting killed in a brutal battle.  In Scorsese's, we know what it's like to *be* in a brutal battle.  This scene in ""Gangs"" is much like the impressionistic snowball fight scene that opens Abel Gance's ""Napoleon"", with a notable exception being, of course, that ""Gangs"" opens with no mere snowball fight.<br/><br/>In short, while Spielberg is intent on documenting facts, Scorsese is more concerned with (as F.W. Murnau would describe it) photographing *thought*. While in the first case we might sometimes wonder if we are just seeing some interesting special effects, the second case leaves no doubt about it: The violence is there because these are violent times.<br/><br/>At the root of this battle is a power struggle between races.  The Irish want to take part in the American dream, but the Butcher will not allow them.  He considers himself to be a ""true"" American, and the name of his gang reflects this.<br/><br/>An interesting thing about ""Gangs"" is that by going back early enough in history, Scorsese is able to document events that we can recognize in other American genre's that appear throughout the history of film.<br/><br/>Most obvious is the gangster film.  The power collaboration (as well as struggle) between the Butcher and Tweed is a precursor to that which we see in films like ""The Godfather"".<br/><br/>Also, as the Irish are coming off the ships, become American citizens, and immediately are recruited to join the Army, we can sense that some of these men would go on to be much like the Irish sergeants which John Ford would feature in most (if not all) of his westerns.<br/><br/>Finally, just as D.W. Griffith's epic depicted the Birth of a Nation - i.e., before the Civil War, many Americans did not consider themselves to be all from *one* nation, but instead from a *state* that was one in a *union* of states - Scorsese's epic depicts the Birth of New York City; the melting pot it would become and pride itself on being.<br/><br/>In one scene, the Butcher comments what a confused and terrible place the country is becoming when he sees a black man dancing an Irish jig.  He considers this to be a summary of what is going wrong with the country. We, of course, see the same thing and consider this merging of cultures to be what makes our country so great.  We our witnessing the Birth of our Nation.<br/><br/>Finally, as with most movies, leave your watch at home. Allow yourself to be lost in the movie, and you're more likely to enjoy it without fretting over details such as the running length, or who's playing what role.  Don't come to see Leonardo.  Don't come to see Cameron Diaz.  And don't stay away because they *are* there.  Come to see the story, and all will be fine."

He makes everyone around him pale in comparison, especially Leonardo DiCaprio. For this reason, I did not believe he was a street thief for a minute, nor would he have been able to walk alongside The Butcher. You can tell from his first fight scene with Bill's henchman that he had no inkling how to put up his fists. Scorsese's usual magical camera seemed to be missing in action, for he decided to let the script tell the story. The screenplay was passable, but it makes me wonder why every script writer in Hollywood has to throw a romantic interest in everything they write. And don't get me started on that horrible CGI ending. There was no need to explain the impact of those times on modern New York.

","If there was ever a doubt of Scorsese's talent and storytelling ability this film puts those doubts to rest. It is obvious from the first scene and the first line all the way through to the ending credits that Scorsese put every fiber of his being into the telling of this epic story of crime, politics, social class, poverty, and gangwarfare set in New York City in the midsts of the turmoil of the Civil War. The shadow of this grand historic event looms above the entire film, but the real story is told in the relatively small area of the Five Points slums and alleys where our characters live and die by ancient codes and rules that few outsiders would ever understand.<br/><br/>But Scorsese's will and talent is also backed up by an amazing cast of characters who give the characters a life and authenticity deserving of such a hallmark film. DiCaprio proves once again that he is a great actor as he takes us through all the actions and emotions of a young Irish hoodlum seeking revenge against his father's killer who takes him under his wing as a surrogate son. Truly one of DiCaprio's finest work in his young career but yes, what you heard is true, Daniel Day Lewis simply overshadows all with his brilliant performance in this film. His portrait of the neighborhood crime lord and local butcher is stunning and is the absolute best reason to watch this movie again and again. If ever there was a performance worthy of an Oscar, surely this must be it.<br/><br/>In the end Gangs of New York is really a timeless story set in a certain historical time and place. And I'm sure for most regular audiences it maybe hard to imagine that these people, places, and events could have ever been a part of real life in America. But not only is this an accurate picture of life in America of the past but in many ways America is still this way, people just choose to ignore those aspects as they have chosen to since well before 1846. Luckily for us we have a director like Scorsese with the guts to actually tell the story of the countless millions who have survived, lived, and rose above the worst of America's filth and poverty.

","This picture begins with a battle bloodier than anything you'll see in The Two Towers, fought in a world less familiar to most of us than Tolkien's Middle-earth. In the New York of 1846, when few Americans owned guns, the gangs of the Five Points neighbourhood do battle with clubs, swords, home-made battleaxes. It's tribal warfare on a pattern thousands of years old - the sort of fight that starts with rival warriors chanting their lineages and grievances, and ends, in this case, with Bill the Butcher's scream of triumph over his fallen enemy, ""Priest"" Vallon: ""See! Who is this that lies beneath my knife?!"" - a homeric line uttered in an accent that might one day become Brooklynese. Let Vallon's body be buried with honour, orders the Butcher, and let his son be given to the Law. Not surprisingly, young Amsterdam Vallon returns 16 years later as Leonardo DiCaprio, burning to avenge his father. Like Hamlet, he takes the rest of the story to do so. Unlike Hamlet, we can kind of understand his slowness, given that he barely knew the man he's avenging, and the man he's supposed to kill takes him into his gang and all but adopts him. Does Bill suspect ""his boy"" is the son of his most admired enemy? Then there's the pickpocket, Jenny Everdine - is she Bill's daughter? His mistress? Both? Scorcese tells a big operatic story here, and if you're not into gore, honour, violence, social history and myth, then I'd advise you to skip it. You'd also better be prepared to spot and figure out the period details - although the more difficult ones, like the names for the different kinds of thief, do get explained. Refreshingly for a historical film, the hero isn't more enlightened than anyone else of his time - Amsterdam's the sort who before a battle prays fervently to the Virgin that his sword might drink its fill of his enemy's blood. Cameron Diaz, too, is one of the few Hollywood actresses I've ever found believable. When we first see her, she looks too clean for the Five Points - but that's because she's going uptown on a job. She gets progressively grubbier as the story goes on. It's true, though, that Day-Lewis' Bill the Butcher is the real reason to see this film. Anyone who complains about scenery-chewing is missing the point- Bill uses ""the spectacle of fearsome acts"" to maintain order, the only way he knows how. Brutal, witty, bigoted and ferociously honest (for a criminal), Bill is someone you wouldn't want to meet, yet need to believe really existed (he is in fact modelled on a real gangster of the period). Also, unlike most people who call themselves ""the Butcher,"" he actually is a real butcher ( rarely has royal favour been so concrete as the raw steaks Bill distributes among his vassals and dependents). In the end, of course, Bill's ritualistic world and fearsome code of honour cannot survive. As he and Amsterdam fight their personal battle to the death, the city around them is being levelled by the Draft Riots and the technology of the Civil War, and it's like watching two medieval knights trying to fight one-on-one in the midst of the Somme. For anyone who has ever suspected the US is a wondrous land of screwed-up giants, Gangs offers a lesson in how it got that way."

","I enjoyed this movie.  I did not feel it was too long nor did I feel the violence was gratuitous.  But I can see where not everyone will agree about it.<br/><br/>Bill the Butcher is an actor's dream character and Daniel Day Lewis played him brilliantly.  I also found the rest of the cast to be just as strong, even if not as colorful or loud.  I liked the contrast of the older and loud Bill being opposite of the sullen and silent young character, Amsterdam. And I wasn't surprised that Dicaprio could hold his own in this film.  Nor was I surprised that he could shift his character's emotions from one moment wanting the respect of the older Bill to the next moment being filled with anger and disgust at the realization that he had just killed a fellow Irishman.  The interaction between these two main characters was the most enjoyable part of the film.  And at the same time, you had a great supporting cast surrounding them.<br/><br/>But what excited me most was how much I left the theater eager to discuss the film.  When's the last time that has happened?  And I don't mean to discuss the music or the camera angles or wether I liked the clothes but rather to discuss the people of the time and what had taken place then. There are so many parallels to today that could be discussed.  I think Scorsese did an excellent job.  Maybe it's not his finest film of all time but it is definitely a success."

","***Minor spoilers***<br/><br/>Director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Jay Cocks revived the violence, hatred, and lawlessness that governed New York City from the 1840s through the bloody Draft Riots of 1863 in the epic film Gangs of New York.  New York natives despised the poor immigrants that arrived daily by the shipload. Continuous bloodshed resulted from intense racial and religious tensions. Prostitutes and pickpockets roamed the city looking for victims.  Hangings in the square brought together the community and elicited loud cheers of approval.  America was born in the streets, and the New York streets were covered in blood and home to the trampling feet of gangs fighting for territory, dignity, and respect in the developing city.<br/><br/>Scorsese wasted no time placing audience members in the time, place, and ambience of this relatively unknown tumultuous era of United States history. Father Vallon (Liam Neeson) carries his cross and marches to a somber beat through the torch-lit catacombs collecting men and women of the Dead Rabbits gang for battle.  A entourage of Irish-Catholics including Happy Jack (John C. Reilly), Hellcat Maggie (Cara Seymour), and Monk (Brendan Gleeson) join the priest before he kicks open the wooden door and steps into the wintry, desolate streets of New York's Five Points.  Young boys including Vallon's son, a present-day Catholic curiosity, accompany the gang but move to the periphery as members of the Bowery Boys lead by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) emerge from their own dilapidated building.  The two leaders exchange battle cries as the people raise their knives and clubs, and the first of many violent sequences ensues.  The pure white snow is defiled with the warm blood of battered members from both gangs before the ensanguined crowd retreats after another day of immense loss.<br/><br/>Nearly twenty years pass before the Gangs of New York camera returns to Five Points, and much in the community has changed though violence and corruption still reign.  Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), the priest's son, returns with the camera after spending his childhood and adolescence in an upstate Catholic orphanage.  The Dead Rabbits are nothing but a memory and no person dares to mention the old gang name.  Members of the fractured gang now offer their loyalties, time, and resources to rival gang leader Bill the Butcher.  Religion died with the priest along with the value and honor attached to both life and death.  Amsterdam steps off the ship with a vengeful heart, but he gradually assumes the role of Bill the Butcher's adopted son and begins to viscerally understand the Dead Rabbits betrayers.<br/><br/>
The turbulent relationship between Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam dominates the story from opening to closing credits, but other characters both add and subtract from the richness of this wonderfully shot film.  Henry Thomas delivers the second most admirable performance as Amsterdam's sidekick Johnny Sirocco.  Sirocco recognizes Amsterdam soon after he returns to New York, and out of respect and admiration he offers to help him survive in the city.  Amsterdam commits another kind of betrayal and alienates Sirocco, who then makes a choice between allegiances and consequently engenders another major conflict.  The character is extremely unlearned and his life is dictated by emotions, which makes him prone to irrational behavior and regrets.  Thomas is endearing from his first appearance, and he demonstrates great versatility in a small but important role.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz slips in and out of her Irish accent, does nothing to improve her poorly-written character, and disturbs the otherwise well-devised cast chemistry as coquettish Jenny Everdeane while DiCaprio and Gleeson deliver particularly commendable performances, but Day-Lewis creates a villain that makes the entire film unforgettable.  Bill the Butcher thrives on putting blood on his blade and uses pigs to practice his technique for slaying human beings.  He never flinches at the slaughter, and he almost never feels remorse walking away from his slaughtered victim whether it be beast or man. He personifies all evils associated with the American Dream such as materialism and the insatiable desire for power.  Bill the Butcher is a loathsome character, but Day-Lewis is too good to be hated and wins over the audience just as he wins over Amsterdam with his dynamic personality.  He is never kind and rarely selfless, but he recognizes the nobility of integrity and honors this trait even though it is a quality he knows he will never himself achieve.  This honorable recognition does not nullify his dishonorable disposition, but it gives the character a tremendous amount of depth that Day-Lewis uses to deliver one of the most noteworthy performances of 2002.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is not historically accurate, but the film still teaches audience members about obscure historical events while it entertains for its nearly three hour duration.  The cinematography is beautiful, Scorsese skillfully incorporates violent scenes into the picture but does not include any superfluous violence and allows other important themes to surface alongside this dominating aspect of nineteenth century New York life, DiCaprio's return to the screen after a lengthy absence is impressive and encouraging, and Day-Lewis secures Bill the Butcher's name in American history.  Gangs of New York contains lackluster moments, but overall it is an exuberant epic well worth the price of a movie theater ticket."

","Visually impressive, but disappointing overall.<br/><br/>(Caution - crucial plot elements discussed - do not read if you don't want to know what happens in this movie.)<br/><br/>Other than the authentic scenery and convincing character portrayal (or creation?) by Daniel Day-Lewis, and the educational value (for anyone who hasn't' read a newspaper in the last three months), Gangs was basically ""Titanic"" set in the slums of New York in the mid 1900's.   It had the same beautiful-people leads (DiCaprio \ Diaz), the same predictable romantic arc (though without the class difference), the same poor-boy-with-regal-bearing-and-inscrutable-moral-character-who's-destined-t o-rise-above-the-evil-people-in-power (why can't he SEE that??), the same insipid longing-for-a-simpler-time \ I-can't-believe-this-ship-is-really-going-to-sink \ what-have-I-done-with-my-life flute soundtrack, the same view that anyone in power or of wealth or success or wearing a uniform has to be corrupt and morally reprehensible (not even Abe Lincoln escapes guilt here), and the same this-story-is-larger-than-life and therefore-representing-man's-eternal-struggle-against-man\nature\evil\corrup tion\take-your-pick as is promulgated in James Cameron's ""epic"" outing.<br/><br/>And WHO could have predicted that there would be a showdown between the two leads in the last battle, and that Day-Lewis would die by DiCaprio's hand, avenging his father's ""unfair"" death??  Shocker.  And, just to let him off the moral hook (he really HATES killing people...), DiCaprio doesn't even strike the mortal wound - that's taken care of by a random Union shell. Of course, he does have to deal the death blow, to complete his mission, but by then it's a fait accompli.<br/><br/>And, though the battle scenes are large and impressive, they're less powerful and gut wrenching than those in ""Braveheart"", produced by a relatively novice director.<br/><br/>Also, these ""epic"" period pieces tend to rely on authentic scenery\clothes\language\customs to sweep you up in the story, hoping that your ""wow"" will let you overlook the clichÃ©d characters or the ""good-guy-bad-guy"" simplicity or the predictable storyline.  ""Gangs"" is no exception.<br/><br/>Plus, some of the plot points are questionable.  We're expected to believe that the Butcher would NOT kill DiCaprio after his assassination attempt? Why?  Because that's what the Priest did for the Butcher??   So all he gives DiCaprio is that little scar on his cheek, which heals nicely by the end of the film?  THAT'S ""horribly disfigured""??   And where's the conflict in DiCaprio's mind?   What exactly is his struggle?   How long to wait before killing the Butcher?<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz, by the way, is all wrong for her part.  (A Golden Globe nomination??)   She's trying to be serious here, but it's obvious she's just LONGING to slip in a ""Something About Mary""-esque wise-crack.<br/><br/>
The glowing reviews received from the majors seem more of an homage to Scorsese's place in the movie business and a tip of the hat to the impressive research and physical effort that went into the mammoth production.  And while there are many moments, especially in the last half hour, where the director's skill is evident, there are others where his camera movement seems forced or unnecessary.<br/><br/>And, while ""Braveheart"" also had a simplistic ""good guy \ bad guy"" setup, the story didn't feel forced.  I was not aware while watching it that, ""wow, that scenery looks so real ..."" - I got involved in the story.  The difference, I think, is that ""Braveheart"" was not trying to be an ""epic"". It just was."

","After seeing the movie, I have to say that the cinematography and editing in this film were up there with Scorcese's finest works. The shots of the detailed mid 19th century New York backdrop were fantastic and wholy believable.<br/><br/>DiCaprio gives a good performance as Amsterdam Vallon, the son of a priest murdered by the local gang leader, Bill the Butcher. It is Daniel Day Lewis, playing this maniacal yet strangely likeable character that is truly the star of the show. Day-Lewis manages to evoke opposing emotions in the viewers, for his actions in certain scenes bring disgust and hatred to the screen while others portray his own inner weakness and humble beginnings which are not that different from Vallon's.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz as the clever pickpocket with a scarred past adds a welcome flavor of playfulness to the film at points. However, she comes from a darker past just as the other main characters and this in a way ties them all together in a deeper sense.<br/><br/>Overall, many segments in the movie come across like excerpts from a very good piece of literature: detailed and completely engrossing. Certain shots, namely the zoom-out from the five points, the pre-battle prayers by Vallon, Bill the Butcher and the rich aristocrat, and the end shot of the graveyard tie to the individual struggles in the movie well yet motion towards a meaning more epic in scale. However, other parts in the movie seem unrealistic and even stretched and hamper the overall flow. The events like the draft riots seem put in place as an afterthought to the conflict between Vallon and The Butcher, which takes away the realism of the film. The battle scenes themselves are done well cinematically speaking, but the reasons for them existing and their relevance to the central struggle seem questionable. This movie is definitely worth seeing, though you'll be disappointed if you're expecting Taxi Driver, Raging Bull or Casino.<br/><br/> Rating: 8/10"
"Kaspar-3","9","0","0","1 January 2003"," Like a fist in the face
","Martin Scorcese's movies are full of demented characters that you wish or pray you'll never encountered in real life. Those fearless sociopaths loves to use knives or kill with their own hands. For the first time though they get their right denomination: ""butcher"". Strange enough, morality is something extremely relative in those films since the characters can kill while reaching sadistic summits and love their mother at the same time. William Cutting reminds me of Tommy DeVito (Goodfellas) in many aspects: they both gangsters of course and you never know when they will decide to slaughter somebody. They bring uncertainty and suspense whenever they appears on the screen making them better villains then those ridiculous horror figures (Jason or Freddy: you name it).<br/><br/>Strong character's type are the mark of all Scorcese films: stories emerge from them. But in Gangs of New York, the social aspect seems to take the first place... for once? (I didn't see The Age of Innocence but I can only guess the approach is similar). Now, characters are mostly driven by archetypes and in some case they are purely and simply caricatures (maybe a strong word in this case) that reacts to the social changes that occurs in New York in the second half of the 19th century. What is remarkable about this film its his incredible cohesion and fairness in his description of real life events. He can show almost all the aspects of this social situation sometime in a single camera shot.<br/><br/>Scorcese focus on New York during the Secession War which is a quite different and original approach then other films with a similar subject (the war). Privation, poverty and racism is generalized while massive immigration brings to America fresh cannon fodder that can fueled the war. In parallel, he shows how immigrants organize themselves into gangs while political order is quite absent or without influence at least until the end of the movie when that order is brutally restored. The thesis deployed by Gangs of New York is quite simple and straightforward: ""legitimate"" politics and obscure gang powers runs the social and economic destiny of that city. Violence joins with ideals and politicians deals with awful criminals.<br/><br/>
It looks a lot like the world I know depicted by newspapers and television but I guess some fictional movies are just more sincere."

","I am a native New Yorker who was unfamiliar with Five Points' history. Although this film was not entirely accurate as a historical account, it was accurate enough - remember that films are stories that do take ""literary license.""<br/><br/>Some people have commented that there were no troops in New York to quell the draft riots, as they were all in Gettysburg. In reality, several regiments at least were sent to New York immediately after the Gettysburg victory at Mr. Lincoln's behest. It seems a bit unfair that General Meade was excoriated for not following General Lee when his army was parsed to quell civilian uprisings. George Gordon Meade may not have been the most brilliant military tactician or strategist in history, but I believe he took an unfair blame for this specific action.<br/><br/>Back to the film - There are a good many open questions in my mind about the gangs, the different police departments and fire services, the government structure. It was not intended to instruct, but to entertain, and it did that well. As an instructional medium, it succeeded in naming the questions about my native city that I will now search the internet to resolve.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese did well - just to get this epic to the screen. It took acts of endurance to complete this project, but complete it he did.<br/><br/>The casting was excellent, and one actor of note did not receive first line billing, although his name deserved it: Liam Neeson. It is a testament to his character that he did not demand higher credit for an important - but small - role.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz discharged their roles well - even if the accents were less than stellar.

"richards1052","8","0","0","6 January 2003"," Long awaited new Scorcese film lets you down
","First, let me say that even a Scorcese near miss is more interesting, more challenging than 95% of Hollywood ""successes.""  As a director, Scorcese is always pondering the deep questions about human existence & presenting it onscreen in a terribly compelling way.<br/><br/>In Gangs he set out to make a great epic on a scale w. the David Lean films like Zhivago or Lawrence of Arabia .  No question, the cinematography is extraordinary.  You feel you are right in the midst of the streets of old NY, a place that once was but will never be again.  You can almost smell the food fr. the stalls, smell the horse dung in the streets, etc.  So Scorcese succeeds in establishing the tone of the great epic films.  But what about characterization & plot?  Here he falls down in my opinion.<br/><br/>Yes, Cutting is an extraordinary character--totally compelling & riveting for every moment he is onscreen.  He is the film's anchor.  But where are the other characters?  Di Caprio is miscast in his role as a sullen youth seeking to avenge his father's murder.  Nothing compelling about his performance at all.  And Cameron Diaz, beautiful, touching Cameron--where is her character in all this?  Almost never to be found I'm afraid.  She has a few good scenes, but then Scorcese seems to tire of her & she disappears for the rest of the movie.  Too bad.<br/><br/>Other problems: IMO the real drama here is not the rivalry bet. the 2 gangs; but rather the Civil War & Draft Riots raging through NYC & the nation simultaneously to the gang violence.  Scorcese does provide some background on the rising level of ethnic & class tension in the city.  BUt he doesn't connect the Civil War to the action at all.  And the Battle of Gettysburg took place only ONE WEEK before the Draft Riots & all Federal troops dispatched frantically to NY came fr. Gettysburg.  Scorcese focuses on hatred bet. Know Nothing German immigrants & Irish Catholic immigrants.  But the hatred & violence shown to Blacks was much more severe & should have been acknowledged more seriously.  After all, the Draft Rioters focused their most serious vehemence against Blacks who were murdered & humiliated in horribly disfiguring ways.<br/><br/>Why doesn't someone do a film about the Draft Riots?  That would be a great drama."

","Scorsese is a brilliant director, creating some genuine masterpieces of film - but I think Gangs of New York may have been just out of his league. Scorsese had everything to work with that usually makes his films blast off: A great cast, true crime story (as true as Hollywood gets, anyhow), and of course dramatic violence to drive home the point that sick human beings are really capable of that kind of stuff.  For some reason, it just didn't work out here in GNY.  As much as I wanted to really enjoy this film, when asked by others how it was, I can only reply ""Ehnnn..."" while turning my hand back and forth.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York displays its Titanic feathers in its very premise.  The scenario pits the hero from the bad part of town (Leo), an initially reluctant love interest (Cameron Diaz/Kate Winslet), the upper echelon villainous villain who has her (Zane/Day-Lewis) and a major historical backdrop with impending doom (SS Titanic/1863 Draft Riots).  Mix it all together, put the dramatic climax during the historical climax (Leo and his love dodging people falling off the titanic into the ocean during the sinking/Leo and his love dodging Navy shelling during the riots), put into context here and there miscellaneous social and political aspects of the historical period (the treatment of the poor and class wars on the Titanic/the treatment of immigrants and Civil War issues in 1863 New York), add a dash of gratuitous nudity (need I embellish?).  Bake at 70 degrees - 55 if the heat's out at the Cineplex - for 3+ hours and...BAM you have yourself a Titanic blockbuster!<br/><br/>Other problems also came to mind while watching this film.  First there's the fact that Leonardo DiCaprio is just not believable as a mid 19th century crime lord.  As good an actor as he is (and his performance in this case wasn't terrible)...the guy is just not believable in GNY.  The accent didn't stick and every time he spoke as the narrator, I momentarily wondered ""Who cast the Malcolm in the Middle Kid to do narration?""  He needs to stick to films that he can be really great in such as Gilbert Grape, Romeo and Juliet, and of course, Titanic.<br/><br/>All in all, GNY was not without its merits.  Daniel Day-Lewis turns in the performance of his career as Bill ""Da Butcha.""  Several scenes with the Butcher were great and the scenes during the election were hilarious. Between those, things could get slow.  The ending was entertaining but overall a letdown.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York had a lot of potential, but when all is said and done at the end, we have another Titanic - beefed-up/heavy, overdone, ==seemingly=> unsinkable?"

I knew that the life of an Irish immigrant was bad, but I never realized how bad.  I went to see this movie for that reason, to see how the Irish were portrayed. I know that this movie wasn't as historically accurate as you would hope. I think most people who watch this type of movie will walk away and think, that's what it was like, with no thought to investigate it further.

","Gangs Of New York, directed by Martin Scorsese has been long anticipated. It was slated for release over a year ago, but was pushed back because of postproduction issues. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz, Gangs tells the tail of a young man (Dicaprio) bent on revenging his fathers death at the hands of a rival gang leader (Day-Lewis) in Civil War Era New York City.<br/><br/>     The film has many problems, the biggest being its unnecessarily long length. Clocking in at 2 hours and 45 minutes, Gangs could have told its story in less than 2 hours in a much more effective manner which would have kept its audience entertained throughout.  The middle of the film needed a visit to the editing room most of all. I found many of the slow paced dialog scenes both uninteresting and unnecessary to forward the plot. The cinematography was good, but not great. It left me wanting to see moreÂ…more of the city, more of the harbor. <br/><br/>     The one place the film does excel is in its 20-minute climax. If I didn't have to suffer through the films first 2 hours, I might have been tempted to give the film a good review based on that very compelling sequence. Unfortunately since I did have to waste two hours of my life to get to that point, I just cannot recommend this film."

But he won't because The Shining was a good movie and this isn't. Day-Lewis is like an all-pro NFL player playing for a team at the bottom of its division.

"enicholson","Null","0","0","30 December 2002"," Sergio Leone meets Charles Dickens in wild west/victorian/medieval New Yawk...
","I'm not sure if this is a great film, but it is a blistering, forceful, insanely ambitious one.  Generally speaking, the story itself contains conflicts and tensions familiar to just about any epic of any kind: of tribe against tribe, poor against rich, and of impassioned youth out to usurp corrupt elders.  But it isn't the nature of these conflicts which makes this film so astounding.  This film's powerful originality instead comes from its wild rendering of a mid-nineteenth century New York context, centered on the slums of the ""Old Brewery,"" that presents striking flourishes of historical details set against hazy Manhattan mythology.  It's this crazy juxtaposition of people who really lived (i.e. Boss Tweed and Horace Greeley) and stuff that really happened (i.e. the Draft Riots) squaring off against Scorsese's immense cinematic (and literary) learnedness and imagination that has cooked up this pastiche setting that feels part Sergio Leone (and not Ford or Peckinpah) western and part Dickens social allegory.  It's also obviously so damn original because I can't think of a single other film that has taken on the subject of New York gangs in the 19th century.<br/><br/>But does this Leonean and Dickensian feel (among other ""feels""), mixed with fact and myth, seem authentic?  I'm not sure I care.  I like this postmodern feel of presenting the past in clearly established style(s) and tropes of the medium(s) -- which is hardly new.  But this is very different for a director like Scorsese, whose signature films to date have generally felt as authentic and immediate as a mugging in Times Square (I mean the old Times Square, before Giuliani cleaned it up for us tourists).<br/><br/>
This Leonean feel of ""Southern Italy meets America"" (sorry, but this film feels much more Italian than Irish) in the form of vicious survivalism and vengeance within an impassioned Dickensian 19th century urban consciousness of tribe and class is the thrust behind this simple story of Irish boy versus ""nativist"" mob boss.  It's not at all the story itself that stands out.  Instead it's the vivid setting and all the every day junk that goes on there.  I think Scorsese -- and of course Daniel Day Lewis -- pull it off brilliantly.<br/><br/>The importance of Daniel Day Lewis' presence in this film can not be overstated.  The man makes the film work as much as Scorsese's gifts as a director do.  Lewis is phenomenal.  By the end of the film DiCaprio suffers in his presence.  Other posters have complained about the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio in the lead role, and I am inclined to agree that the request of his services is rather uninspired (fiery overachievers like Matt Damon or Colin Farrell would perhaps have fit the bill better), but Leo is not bad in the film.  At times Leo is very good; it's just that it's hard to suspend disbelief when Leo is required to be a gang leader to a gang that rivals that of Bill the Butcher.<br/><br/>There are some other flaws as well -- mainly in the script.  The romance between Leo and Cameron seems a bit tossed in -- here paying a greater homage to the Dickensian love interest over Leone's (and Scorsese's) usual universe of killers and broads.  But I find a flaw like this almost charming -- as if there is a sentimentalist in Scorsese that is more willing to show itself, even if it is a little awkward in its footing.<br/><br/>SOME MILD SPOLIERS:<br/><br/>By the end the draft riots have exploded in a grand vengeance.  The lead characters lose their way and their identity as the mob and the military moves in; the individual leads are wiped out as the people of New York overtake the setting.  A brutal story gives way to even more brutal history. These selfish, vicious, vengeful characters fade into a fog of violent Manhattan legend and the film becomes as murky as the tradition of tales that inspired its making in the first place.  I think this is part of the point of Scorsese's film: that if we choose to live in our times concerned only about ourselves and our immediate gripes and hatreds, then, as a people, we can only become part of a corrupt body or be part of a deadly mob.  While other filmmakers romanticize the murderous the individual gangster and outlaw, Scorsese prefers to crush him with some kind of angel of vengeance, here in the form of deadly riots (TAXI DRIVER was an exception, where the murderous protagonist was himself the angel of vengeance).<br/><br/>Scorsese seems to have become a great historical (and mythical) filmmaker without anyone even noticing it.  Beginning with RAGING BULL, and carrying through with GOODFELLAS and CASINO and now GANGS OF NEW YORK, -- all true stories or based on true stories -- Scorsese is now one of our greatest historical filmmakers.  But can he continue to make films like this which also are so reliant on myth, and on the play of genre(s), and on firmly established traditions set down by other directors and writers over the past century?  Who knows?  It's nice to see him go back to this 19th century Manhattan again -- to someone else's place -- and this time take it out to his turf -- the streets."

"colin_alberts","Null","0","0","30 December 2002"," Now we know why Scorsese took two years to release it
","I went to this movie with very high hopes.  Hopes that were dashed as soon as the first fight scene got underway.  Scorsese knows how to choreograph violence, to be sure, but he had to include a heavy-metal soundtrack to accompany it.  That gimmick reminded me of ""The Scorpion King"", and in the end, that's about how good this movie was too.  DiCaprio, true to form, delivered a performance that was on the ability level of a high school senior play.  I didn't buy the notion that this guy would rise to the top of a gang of toughs, not for one second.  He's a pretty boy, and I would have thought that a director of toughs like Scorsese would have understood that.<br/><br/>It's not necessary to the artistic or commercial success (or failure) of a film, but it should be pointed out that the story is a total rape of actual history.  While Scorsese may be entitled to make an impressionistic ""opera"" about the real events, he is being ridiculous in suggesting that an Irish gang leader in 1863 would be sympathetic to African-Americans, but I guess he thinks that depicting otherwise would tarnish his hero too much in the audience's eyes.  Also, he makes Tammany Hall and the Democrats' adversaries out to be the Know-Nothing Party, which had already broken up before the Civil War.  But depicting the actual opposition, i.e., the Republican Party, would have been embarrassing for Scorsese, inasmuch as having them in the movie would have had to have made DiCaprio et al. as the political force a) actively hostile to blacks and to abolition, and b) at best indifferent to maintaining the Union."

"andrew-378","Null","0","0","3 January 2003"," A Closer Look at Bill the Butcher
","I agree with most of the reviewers on IMDB that GONY is a flawed masterpiece that succeeds despite it's plot shortcomings and low-wattage performances by Leo and Cameron. Where the movie excells, in my opinion, is in its dialogue and character development, especially for Bill the Butcher.<br/><br/>
I was completely blown away by the genious of Daniel Day-Lewis in constructing his character (Just hand him the Oscar, please!). Everything from his perfect proto New York accent to his leers, squints and grimaces, to his flashes of sarcastic wit, to his stylized body language, make him the most compelling screen character that I have seen for quite a while. However, what most reviewers have missed is that the character is not the elementally evil force that movie goers expect to see in this kind of film. In many ways, Scorsese and the screenwriters portray him as honorable, loyal, idealistic, respectful of intellect, patriotic, and to some extent fatherly. Of course all of these qualities are twisted in him, by the brutality of his environment and his misguided view of what it means to be an American.<br/><br/>If you closely look at the story arc, what exactly are the diffrences in the way that Bill's character behaves as compared to Priest Vallon, (Leo's father briefly played with great affect by Liam Neeson)? By his actions at the beginning of the film, and in revelations towards the end, we see that ""The Priest"" (if he really is one....because why would a Catholic priest have a son?)is a violent gang leader who is fanatically aligned with his cause and people (Irish Catholics). Is this so different than Bill? Of course, we have sympathy for Vallon because he is an immigrant, has a son, and apparantly has God on his side, but isn't that just sentimentality?<br/><br/>
(Spoiler ahead) For his part, Bill is shown as revering Priest Vallon more than any of his fellow Nativists, or anyone for that matter who has ""sold out"" (ala Boss Tweed). And in sparing the life of Amsterdam (after he finds out that Leo has been secretly plotting his death), shows a trait remarkebly similar to the mercy that was earlier shown to him (Bill) by the Priest. Above all, Bill admires a chivalric code of conduct, courage, and dash, and intelligence. This is why he is so attracted to Amsterdam, and is so hurt by what he sees as a betrayal.<br/><br/>I do not mean to argue that Bill the Buther is meant to be a ""good"" character, and the hero of this movie. But the strength of GONY is that is presents a complex reality that is not weighed down by typical Hollywood notions of good and evil. In the end though, both ""good"" and ""evil"" are subsumed by the larger polical forces, and forgotten by the city that they fought and died for.<br/><br/>We can only hope that the great Day-Lewis doesn't wait another five years for his encore."

","""Gangs of New York"" is everything you've heard it was: dark, dramatic, violent, moving, thought-provoking, and, yes, very long. I felt that Martin Scorsese could have told the same story, with as much gravity, and still cut the movie by 30 minutes. Still, there are really very few spots that drag. While I do not believe it is the best film of the year, it does contain the best performance. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing as Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. He makes you hate the character, as well as find yourself laughing with his cruel jokes. The character reminded me of ""Curly Bill"" Brocious (played by Powers Boothe) in ""Tombstone"", in that he was evil to the core, but still had plenty of charisma. His was not the only character that stood out. Brendan Gleeson breaks out as Monk, and Cameron Diaz gives her best performance to date. The film is good, but not great. The direction should be rewarded, as it is on the scale of ""Braveheart"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"". Scorsese balances hundreds of extras and a beautiful set to bring the viewer right into the scenes. The battles are as gruesome as in any movie, but still leave plenty to the imagination. The final camera shot is also powerful, and quite moving as it shows the evolution of New York City. I recommend this film to anyone who enjoys good movies, but was slightly disappointed due to the large build-up. I believe it will still be nominated for Best Picture in the Academy Awards, but feel that the true winners should be Scorsese and Day-Lewis."

And as for the bombing, I didn't really understand why the ships were shooting bombs at the place where the gangs were going to fight because that was not where the mob was. Just another complaint that makes the story hard to follow and not too good.(END OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: I wouldn't say this is bad, just average.

Who would of known (unless you were a thorough historian) that Lincoln's administration was involved in the awful conscription of immigrants into this man's army.  Truly a bridge to the future.<br/><br/>However, the story seems like some over-wrought, highly produced passion-play or made-for-tv movie.  It truly lacks the genius of Scorsese; the ability to take gritty, disgusting, vile image of people and converting them into characters that we can sympathize with in context.  We all loved Jimmy and Tommy in Goodfellas, but can we say the same of the melodramatic Amsterdam.  In Taxi Driver he takes an urban landscape of scum and depravity, shows us a psychotic man, and enables us to feel for this horrible beast.  He demonstrates some of his patented techniques in ""Gangs"" such as the panning shot and the quick zoom.  The silent commentary of the immigrants registering as citizens, enlisting in the conscript, boarding the vessel for the war zone, and the coffins leaving the ship is quite majestic. That is truly Vittorio de Sica.  That is part of Martin's genius.  That tells a story.<br/><br/>With Cameron Diaz and Henry Thomas, it feels like Legends of the Fall at Times.  DiCaprio is good, and Daniel-Day Lewis is brilliant.  A bit over the top, but brilliant.  My favorite Brendan Gleason is grossly under used and John C. Reilly is strong, but half of a character.

Here, Gangs of New York comes along and redeems the genre.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's career long dream is finally realized, and in grand fashion no less. Gangs is nearly flawless, with well-written dialogue, an excellent score, and plenty of brutal action. One can understand why the movie cost so much when they see the set, built in its entirety complete with weathered buildings and cobblestone streets. Gangs has the opportunity here to rake in a slew of Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part is sound, with notable exceptions to Daniel Day-Lewis as William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting and Cameron Diaz as Jennie Everdeane. Day-Lewis's character is incredibly believable, at times causing my heart to mercilessly pound in my chest. He is generous and sophisticated, yet at the same time egotistical and wicked. His penchant for punishment and skill with his carving knives is intimidating and commanding, of both respect and subordination. Basically, Daniel Day-Lewis scared the sh*** out of me, at one point causing me to tremble, with my heart beating out of my chest. Yeah, he was good. Cameron Diaz also turned in a great performance, her character being a talented pickpocket/con woman who falls in love with the main character Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio). I was impressed with her consistency and emotion, and her inner struggle played out well, following the plot as it moved along. It's refreshing to see her doing more challenging work, as her last couple movies were chick flicks and gross-out comedies. She's definitely talented and I look forward to more of her work.<br/><br/>There were however a couple flaws that really stuck out to me. All throughout the  movie, DiCaprio is narrating over the score, and the thing that bothers me the most is that it was not the Irish accent he spoke with during the movie. I'm not sure if Scorsese was implying that DiCaprio's character was looking back on everything as a middle-aged adult who had grown to lose the accent, but it irritated me every time he spoke in that manner. Another problem is DiCaprio's consistency. While his acting was strong on the whole, he seemed to be wavering back and forth between Irish and New York accents. Finally, there was just things in the background that seemed to steal the moment from time to time. It was little things that sort of threw off the committment to the period, but then again, I was sitting in the front row, so everything may have been a little skewed to me.<br/><br/>One other thing I want to mention about this movie is the score. It's an interesting style they went with, something one would not necessarily thing could go with this movie. For me it was definitely a complement to the movie, adding to the darkness of these people's lives and instilling discomfort and dread of the inevitable in me.<br/><br/>There's nothing more I need to say. Just go see this movie. I'll definitely go a few more times. Five stars.<br/><br/>And by the way...<br/><br/>If Daniel Day-Lewis doesn't get serious Oscar consideration, my faith in the Academy of Motion Picture Sciences will be all but lost."

But instead the film is a jerky, often difficult to understand parody of a time in America's history that while certainly more violent than one can imagine could not have been so cartoonlike and so full of frankly bizarre and corrupt characters. The violent scenes were nothing special and actually for all their brutality failed to convey the violence. Compare truly believable violent scenes from Saving Private Ryan; Braveheart, Gladiator, Pulp Fiction, etc. and Scorcese did nothing special with these scenes. There was so much potential for a visually stunning film- but even this opporunity was wasted until the closing.  We see hardly nothing of the spectacle that New York must have been in the 1860's. Think of what Coppolla did in GFII with New York of the Italian immigrant. We are given no real flavor of the time and the incredible variety of cultures that had to exist at the time.

First I'd like to say that Daneil Day Lewis played his role perfect. He did so good in his role as the butcher that I cannot imagine any another actor in that role (Really). I also liked the surreal, Dirty,Brutal,Gritty old 19th century New York City setting..I though the sets were fantastic.

Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio were the way wrong choices for this film. I remeber thinking to myself as I was watching it that Colin Farrell or Ewan McGregor would've been much more better suited for the role of Anstredam than DiCaprio was. And Diaz is much too much of a modern California girl to star in this period film set in 19th century New York City and it shows. Again I found myself recasting that role to Kristen Dunst or Heather Graham who I believe would've been for better in that role than Diaz. Niether Diaz or DiCaprio are convincing and there acting skills are just flat all the way through this film. Another pitfall of this film is the miserable film score. the pulsating hich school marching band style snare drums that continuously play to a fast paced beat actually begins to give you a headache before the film  is finished.<br/><br/>Its worth watching at least once...I dont know if it was too much or not enough, this music score is god-aweful, but I gave it 6 stars out of 10."

","This movie was so intriguing to me because of Daniel Lewis.  He was so credible as Bill Cutting, Bill the Butcher.  The clothing that he wore, the way he spoke and the rage that consumed him made for a very memorable performance.  He should get nominated for this easily come the Oscars.  As for Leonardo, he was good also.  Cameron Diaz was, as always, forgettable. But I can't stress enough how Marty S. pulled this one off.  I have always been very interested in New York history.  There is a lot that I didn't realize went on in New York in those days..such as feuding between fire departments and the immense hatred of Irish immigrants.  Also, the hatred of Lincoln!  I had no idea he was so hated by those opposed to the draft. There were also scenes when as soon as the Irish immigrants got off the boat, they enrolled for the DRAFT!!  In any event, this is a three hour movie and it's good.  Sure, it's violent but it's also a historical epic.  I give this two thumbs up BIG TIME."

","Martin Scorsese brings us this excellent period piece set in the tumultuous mid-1800s in New York's Five Points. It takes place during the real events leading up to the 1863 draft riots. I admit I don't know how historically accurate it is, but it gives the appearance of being authentic. I had been anxiously awaiting this film, but had some slight reservations regarding the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. I like them, but weren't sure if they'd be right for these roles. Both did admiral jobs. Leo surprised me a bit with how well he came across and Cameron definitely did her best though occasionally seemed slightly unbelievable for the time. The success of this movie was the casting of Daniel Day-Lewis as William ""The Butcher"" Cutting in his first role in several years. He carried this movie with his excellent and believable portrayal of this bad man. The movie runs a bit long, but to it's credit, it does cover a lot of ground.<br/><br/>

","Gangs of New York had so much potential. It could have been a powerful, gut-wrenching, pseudo-historical epic... but alas, no such luck.<br/><br/>
It suffers most from a lack of aim. It doesn't know whether to be a tale about an aggravated period of New York's history, or a simple tale of revenge. And after stumbling back and forth for three hours trying to decide which direction to go in - it ultimately fails to satisfy on both accounts. Daniel Day Lewis pays wonderful homage to Deniro (although I'm not sure if that was intentional), and the rest of the cast do an okay job. But if I were you, I'd leave after the opening sequence 'cos it ain't going nowhere but downhill from there my friends."

","Another wasted opportunity to present a story of epic proportions, dragged down by the ""suits"", who have finally managed to geld one of the true giants of Cinema.<br/><br/>At the turn of the Millennium, I feel sorry for Martin Scorcese. Given free rein, there is no way he would have cast the insipid Leonardo de Caprio as the protagonist, nor the similarly vapid Ms. Diaz as the ""love interest"". Even assuming he DID go for this, I suspect that the hour or so removed from his original cut must have contained far more of Horace Greely and Boss Jim, for example, than Leo and Cameron superfluously comparing scars before ""making out"".  <br/><br/>Martin denies all this of course, but with $100 million or so having to be recouped before any profits, I smell a ruinous hatchet job on his orginal concept.  <br/><br/>The young female audience must be accomodated nowadays, but Leo can't begin to compare with (for just one example) Brad Pitt in the brooding, menace-below-the-surface department.

"iamjacksemail","8","0","0","3 January 2003"," A Flawed but Masterful Epic
","Gangs of New York is a flawed film. It is gigantic in scope and Scorsese and the production design team bring the feel and the look of the time to life, creating a dingy and dangerous world inhabited by a number of interesting characters. Perhaps the biggest problem with the film is the fact that the story that has been used to draw the viewer into this world does not do justice to the characters and the visual scope of the film.<br/><br/>
The other major flaw is in the casting. The performances are all good. DiCaprio and Diaz are both surprisingly good. Henry Thomas brings a great measure of awkwardness and toughness to the role of Amsterdam's sidekick. Brendan Gleeson is great, making the figure of Monk as larger than life as he would need to be to live as an independent in the heart of gang conflict. However, towering above them all is the incredible embodiment of Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting by Daniel Day-Lewis. Much has been written about the strength of Day-Lewis' performance and all of it is accurate. His Bill is frighteningly ruthless, vicious, and calculating. He is the lord of the Five Points and it is abundantly clear how this man could muster so much fear in a population of hoodlums and gang members. His performance, however, is so great that it absolutely overwhelms DiCaprio's. Amsterdam never feels a worthy adversary for the Butcher and certainly does not seem strong enough to stand against the imposing figure of Bill.<br/><br/>The film is violent and especially in its opening sequence brutal. But it is also a brilliant depiction of a world that is not as ancient history as we would probably like to think it is. What really makes the film interesting, however, are the multiple themes developed throughout, including the religious division between the Natives and the Dead Rabbits gangs and the political corruption that went hand in hand with the lives of the gangs. The relationship between the Butcher and political leader Boss Tweed is perhaps the most interesting in the film. The subtle dance of power between the muscle of the Butcher and the organizational brain of Tweed is an almost hypnotizing back and forth. This relationship also brings up the most dominant theme of the film, the one brought out in the tagline, that is the manner in which the city of New York as a microcosm of America was built and the men who built it.<br/><br/>These themes, however, also highlight the flaws of a film that perhaps tries to do and be too much. The rogues gallery of characters are interesting but the story does not always make them compelling. The lives of the characters seem to be secondary to the world that they inhabit and the themes that likely drew Scorsese to this project with such passion. These themes, however, seem to be not fully developed, especially the religious theme common to much of Scorsese's work and so the film raises questions and ideas but does not always adequately explore them with the audience. The triumph of the film is that it manages to overcome these flaws and maintain the interest of the audience throughout. The film moves briskly through its almost three hour length and in some ways leaves the audience wanting more. Despite its missteps, it is compelling and engaging, provocative and thoughtful, and above all an incredible feat of movie-making. While it won't be remembered as Scorsese's best picture it certainly deserves notice as his most ambitious and it is a marvel simply to see the tapestry that weaves slowly and deliberately before your eyes. Gangs is a great film, it is simply not as great a film as perhaps we wish Scorsese could have produced."

","*Gangs of New York*<br/><br/>I doubt I have ever seen a movie of this caliber in the theaters.  That might have meant something a little more if the Roger Ebert had said it, granted I am only 15.  But for three short hours (not being sarcastic there, the time did go by quickly) I lived in New York 1863.  A rarity in most films today is that they can take you in heart and mind to where the story is taking place.  But this one did.  It wasn't glamorous New York like we might see in most New York based movies coming out now that just scream ""I LOVE NEW YORK!""  No, this was the dirty, grungey New York of nightmares. Life isn't all good even if you have money, everyone is against you, out to get your money so that one day they might be in the same position as the rich.  The setting is incredible, damn George Lucas for suggesting Martin Scorsese use a computer generated set instead of building one.  It's so massive, and you can see the fine detailing and all the hard work.  Every scene is picture perfect.<br/><br/>And then there were the characters.  Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) will go down in history as one of film's most memorable characters.  He was hated and loved sometimes at the same time.  Amsterdam Vallon, the unusual hero of some sort, was also a very interesting character.  Does he like the man that murdered his father before his eyes?  Cameron Diaz's character, Jenny nurses his wounds and kisses his scars.  Does Vallon care so much about her?  Either way, they have great chemistry, and not that phony Hollywood kind either.<br/><br/>The acting was beyond words for one reason, one man.  Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher.  Incredible performance.  If this man does not win the best actor Oscar, it's just proof the Academy is once again, corrupt. Day-Lewis was once considered one of Hollywood's sexiest, if definitely not in this movie.  He is dirty, greasy, and low.  And incredibly in character. Congrats, Day-Lewis, you have just won yourself another Oscar.  Another great performance was of course, our dear beloved Leonardo Dicaprio.  For years he was considered a lover boy and nothing else (it makes me mad to this day.  In Titanic, yes he was a lover boy, get over it) but this year he broke out of that box that we made for him.  He played two COMPLETELY different characters in Catch Me If You Can and Gangs of New York, but he played them both flawlessly and deserves a nomination for one of the movies. Cameron Diaz was wonderful, not so Oscar Worthy, but good for what she was. And if she is nominated, please let it be in the best supporting actress category 2002 was a great year for supporting casts, but this one takes the cake.  Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, and Liam Neeson just to name a few. <br/><br/>

"johnlewis","8","0","0","28 December 2002"," Gives new meaning to the term ""Melting Pot"". As in Heat.
","Not an easy film to review. First and most importantly- one that gets such an extreme mix of very bad and very good reviews deserves the truth: this is a very good film. Not one of the best of the year, but just very much above average. I hold a more balanced view of this film than most seem to. I have mixed opinions- mainly regarding the exgageration of the level of violence being so far out, that it made the whole film seem like a surreal science fiction story of an alternate universe of New York City in the mid-1800s. A little more historical accuracy would have made this film a lot more enjoyable for me personally. But if one really likes historical large epic films, this will certainly not disappoint. There are NO boring parts in this film that I can recall. The three hours does pass like three hours, because the tension is high throughout, but it sure was exciting enough and very entertaining. Gangs of New York is a real masterpiece for Martin Scorsese. He has produced so many extremely fine films, such as Kurosawa's Dreams; but most of his directoral films have not been very highly regarded. This film does break that streak. OK- here is the key to know whether or not you should see this film. First- if you cannot think of more than five long films (over 2 1/2 hours) that you have liked before, then do not see this film. In that case, one would have too short of an attention span to enjoy this movie. Second, and more importantly- is the graphic violence and carnage. It is very extreme, so if one has a low tolerance for that kind of thing, then wait for the edited video version from your local ""edited video"" store. As unrealistic and extreme as the violence was, Gangs of New York made me think about some important aspects of our historical roots. Like many, I'm of Irish descent. I realize why most of us know so little of our immigrant origins. The poverty, squalor, and quasi-annonymnity of that kind of existance would tend to crowd out intellectual endeavors and record keeping, and discourage telling of stories to children. ""Well I remember the time my two uncles starved to death and we survived on sewer rats for three years..."" Not very enjoyable to retell or recall. Another thing it made me realize was how literal the term ""melting pot"" really was. I had wrongly assumed before that the term meant merely genetic and social mixing. This film made me realize that it also means the violent mixing ""heated up"" our American pot of people. First it generated hatred, but after it cooked awhile, it fused us together and difused the hatred (at least for many). So now, many of us Americans have a tradition and heritage of tolerance, acceptance, and even closeness between races and very different cultures. Of course we are not unique, in that the whole world is now a melting pot in all the same ways and more. To sum this film up- it is very entertaining in similar ways as Speilburg and others have done before, but with added elements of greater detail and historical insight. Gangs of New York is a significant acheivement for Martin Scorsese, even if it is not the best film of the year."

","I wasn't sure exactly what to expect when I went to see Gangs of New York. I only knew what actors I'd be seeing and had only a vague idea of what the story was going to be from the trailers I'd seen on TV. But now, after seeing the movie two days ago, I realize just how much of a masterpiece Martin Scorsese has put together with this movie, and I'm even more glad that he didn't create it back in the early 80's casting The Clash, as there's no way it could have lived up to what this movie ended up being in 2002. But as good as the movie was, it would have been well short of the masterpiece it is, were it not for Daniel Day-Lewis' performance as legendary gangster Bill ""the Butcher"" Poole (Bill Cutting, as he is referred to in the film). Don't get me wrong, Jim Broadbent plays an excellent Boss Tweed, and greatly resembles the legendary NY political boos, too. Cameron Diaz and Leonardo DiCaprio frankly don't give outstanding performances, but they give solid ones. The supporting cast provide characters you really feel you know by the end of the film, especially John C. Reilly and the brief but important ""Priest"" Vallon played by Liam Neeson. However, it seems as if the whole movie revolves around Day-Lewis, whose character overshadows all else. From the moment you see his ""Butcher"" walk on screen, you can't help but feel his character's power. He barely seems human; he walks like he's on stilts and wears a cartoonishly-large top hat, but all for a purpose. This makes his character seem larger than life, as well the character should seem. Anyone who remembers the honorable hero Day-Lewis played in 1993's The Last of the Mohicans will barely recognize him here. All in all, this movie is well worth the trip to the theatre. The dialogue is witty and sharp, the sets incredible, the ensemble cast convincing in their roles, and the cinematography brilliant. But make no mistake, the chance to see Day-Lewis in one of the best performances in cinema history is alone a good enough reason to see Gangs. Don't let this one pass you by. 10/10."

This is one of the poorest areas of New York City where many Irish immigrants are settling. Prejudice against immigrants is the core of the struggles that resulted in the initial battle and remains an open wound. Later, the impact of the Civil War on the lives of these already embattled in class conflicts results in escalated and more impersonal violence.<br/><br/>A passionate affair with a luminous Cameron Diaz takes place, a love triangle with the man who killed the elder Vallon.<br/><br/>The poor protest, Federal soldiers shoot them down, to be repeated during nearly every war since. In ""Gangs,"" the controversy is played out in the context of the Civil War. The poor go to war; the rich avoid conscription for a fee of $300, a fortune at the time. (Now they join the National Guard.) In anti-draft rioting in 1863, as a century later, innocent people are killed, either drafted to fight and die for a country that has abandoned them or, once again, as at Kent State, killed by soldiers (National Guardsmen) on our own streets.<br/><br/>I pity the people who are bored by this movie. Who was it who said, ""Those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it""? The current US president, who did not fight in Vietnam, is now planning a war that raises the same issues about the draft and executive powers, a war even less pertinent to most of our lives than the Civil War was to the impoverished residents of New York's slums.<br/><br/>This movie reminds us that, though memories of specific events once so impassioned and meaningful eventually fade away, we experience our own versions of them in our own era.<br/><br/>The acting, directing, cinematography, and editing are all superb.

I thought it was better than LOTR, which I also loved (by the way, from now on I will also be abbreviating ""Gangs of New York""). I do indeed have a soft spot for epic films, history, bloody violence, and male angst.

Is the film satisfactory when it comes to explaining the story to it's viewers, much like LOTR was? I don't know.<br/><br/>I thought the film was very well cast, including Dicaprio and Diaz, though I would've liked to see just a little more emotion from them throughout. The cinematogrophy is great, most of all the scene where Monk kicks opens the door and the camera leads the Dead Rabbits into battle. If this is the ""MTV style editing"" that some of you have alluded to as being a problem in the film, well then we just simply disagree.

From reading the reviews by IMDB users, I can tell that there are many devoted Scorsese fans who despise this film. This is and isn't a typical Scorsese film. It panders (for a lack of a better word) to the audience much more than his other films, but it also expresses the same basic ideas that his other films do.<br/><br/> Anyways, whatever, I can't figure it out.

While this style is very effective for films set in modern day, RAGING BULL for example, they do not translate well to a story that takes place roughly 150 years ago. Take for example, the brutal opening battle sequence between the ""natives"" and the ""foreign hordes."" The battle is cut very rapidly (which works), but electric guitars are used to undercut everything. While their jarring notes makes for an effective scene, in hindsight, it is not very appropriate when you consider that this is, above all things, a period piece. A telling of history. The visuals do enough.<br/><br/>The story is concerned with what happened in New York City from 1846, when two gangs went to war, led the Priest Vallon (Liam Nelson) for the Irish immigrants, and William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis)- dubbed ""Bill the Butcher""- for the natives. The film continues on until 1863, the draft riots, which left countless people dead (the film tells us that ""we never knew how many New Yorkers lay dead""). Perhaps this is sort of a fault in story telling. I myself did not know much of anything (fine- nothing) of these events, and the film does not give a very good background. Throughout the film, I wasn't very interested in the personal struggle, because I didn't understand the big picture. Maybe if it had started out with some information like Gladiator did, to set the mood and give some background information, I would've been able to focus easier.<br/><br/>The smaller picture is a simple revenge story, the historical aspects of the film are in the background. The main plot is that when the Priest is killed during a battle, his son (played as a grownup by Leonardo DiCaprio) vows revenge on his killer- Bill the butcher (I thought that he was called the butcher because of his brutal fighting style, turns out that he actually is a butcher, and in one scene, shows Leo how to kill a pig). DiCaprio is good in the lighter scenes of the film, such as the playful ones with Cameron Diaz, playing a pick pocket- but he lacks some of the anger needed to make the audience understand his motives. In one scene he saves Bill from an assassin (he is under his wing at this time), because he wants to be the one to kill him I guess. If he had been so bent on revenge that it was clear that nothing would get into his way, even an ally, it would make for a more powerful (and interesting) character.<br/><br/>If I have made the film sound bad, then I have miswritten this review. There are many, many good things in the film- they easily outnumber the bad. Looking at the film is a treat, the sets (all real, none computer generated I'm told) are all perfect, and the photography is beautiful to behold. Howard Shore's score is often fitting, but fellow fans of Lord of the Rings will notice several similar melodies. And the actors give good enough performances that you can easily believe them in their roles (Diaz, while an odd pick for the role, does a good job. And DiCaprio's failures (mentioned above) are few and far between, and not enough to ruin the film's pace.). Daniel Day-Lewis gives such a good performance that he will not doubt be honored come award time, and his performance will earn the honor of being parodied and studied for a long time to come. And I love how there is a flash forward of more than 100 years at the end of the film- and how Scorsese isn't scared to show the World Trade Center in modern New York, indeed, this is one of his themes: the draft riots were a horrible time in NYC's history, but look at what rose out of it. September 11th was another horrible time, imagine what can be created now.<br/><br/>This film has been in Scorsese's head for 20 years... I wonder what aspect of the story appealed to him the most. Probably the historical aspect of it- he, of course, loves New York, this film is a tribute to the city's strength. I'd doubt if he was drawn to the revenge story as much. That part seems unworthy of a film maker such as Scorsese, and the somewhat cliche ending is as well.<br/><br/>The film is long, and the time goes by slowly in some scenes, (though fast in others). The Two Towers is about the same running length as Gangs of New York, but I didn't notice how uncomfortable my seat was until it was over. In this movie, I did.<br/><br/>I'm wondering if I should recomend this film. If you're a fan of Scorsese, or anyone in the cast, you should see it. If you like historical epics, or lavish productions, you will appreciate it. The things that bothered me will probably not bother you. If you think you'll like it, you probably will. But if you don't think you will, you won't. I liked it a lot, but didn't love it. It'll probably be a while before I watch it again. I gave it an 8 out of 10, but that's only because there is no 7.5"

","Gangs of New York is an amazing movie which must win at least 3 big Academy awards in order for me to have my faith restored in the ceremony (Director, Picture, Supporting Actor). Scorsese does a superb job in directing this film and shows why he's the most important director of the last 30 years. I recently read a newspaper article that heaps praise upon him and I can see why. Dicaprio surprises with his best performance to date but is overshadowed by Day-Lewis who gives an eerie performance that reminds us why awards are handed out. Mail him the trophy now, Academy, and save yourself some time. Oh, by the way, I loved this movie. A masterpiece. 10/10"

","Scorsese is sometimes called ""America's Great Director."" It's just too bad that his past few films really have been misses instead of hits. Much like ""Bringing Out the Dead"" ""Gangs in New York"" is misguided. The story is set around a war between the natives (people born in America) and the Irish who have just come off the boat. They battle for control of 5 points. But what for? I never really got an answer other than respect or control over an area. Well, then why not make this film in 1980's and make them punk gangs. Because there are too many issues introduced from a historical standpoint that smokescreen the point of the film.<br/><br/>You can tell by the first battle scene that something is very wrong with this movie. Both groups have swords and clubs like some medieval battle, but the first couple of people who are cut down no blood is shown. Why not? It is an R rated film. Infact for all of the people killed the blood should have soaked the ground. The blood against the snow would have been a good idea, but it is shown as barely a pink color. Some films are great with an opening battle scene: Braveheart, Gladiator, and Saving Private Ryan. This one is very uneventful other than to set out the main character's revenge trail.<br/><br/>The film is set against the draft of the Civil War, slavery, immigration problems and all the things New Yorkers had to deal with during the Civil War. Basically too many issues to have for one movie, at least not a 3 hour movie-- more like a 5 hour. So already the film is full with those issues, now, throw in a revenge and love story. Is that too much? How about a riot with Union Soldiers interrupting the final battle scene? How about an election for public office? Oh what's this movie about again? Who knows. I spent some time after seeing it and wondered if this was some project that was forced to be made because of all the post-production put into it. It was shot almost 2 years ago. This movie reminds us that if something sits on the shelf too long that should have been forgotten.<br/><br/>My advice to anyone planning to spend the money on watching this film is to go to a library and read up on early American History, perhaps then you will be able to make more sense than this film did. There are too many issues to pay attention to and it distracts from what could have been a great movie. Better luck next Scorsese."

","Daniel Day-Lewis is magnificent.  The cinematography is top notch. However the rest of Gangs of New York is pretty ordinary.  It is certainly too long, by at least a half hour.  I am sure they are proud of their work, but does every single crane shot have to be extended to show the entire set.  There are many non essential scenes which linger on and detract from the meat of the story.  I liked this movie, and even I was getting antsy as the plot creeped on.<br/><br/>

","I enjoy documentaries.  I also enjoy dramas.  There have been absoluting astonishing works in both formats.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Gangs"" is that it attempts to be both.  That is extremely difficult to do well.  A fairly straightforward revenge tale - and who from the first few minutes does not know how this ultimately will turn out? - is made to appear ""important"" by weaving in known historical figures and events, with a few invented events thrown in for good measure.  The attempt ultimately fails, and it is a shame.<br/><br/>For some reason, director Scorcese chose to turn a rather pedestrian story about a gang leader's son who seeks revenge on the man who killed his father (under inherently fair circumstances, I might add) into a far more sweeping story about the ""immigration experience.""  This topic may or may not be one that has personal significance to Mr. Scorcese and his family, but whether it does or not it should not have found its way into this film.  Every single scene with characters such as the famous Horace Greeley (""Go West Young Man"", also a losing presidential candidate) should have been cut, for they have nothing to do with the central characters. The camera notices some immigrants coming off a ship - and we are suddenly treated to completely pointless (in terms of the story) comments about when they will get fed. Endless time is spent on repetitious character development when we already understand the characters in question and it is time to move on already.<br/><br/>In a sense, the movie this most reminded me of was ""How the West Was Won."" Personally, I liked that movie, but less due to the story and more because it had some stunning performances by legends such as John Wayne, James Stewart, Gregory Peck and George Peppard.  The actors in ""Gangs"" are talented, but hardly in that class (sole exception Day-Lewis, who is brilliant). If the narrator in ""West"" wanted to wander off topic about how people traveled to the Midwest, that was fine, it made the story seem more important despite depersonalizing the movie.  At least that movie stayed true to historical facts.  Here, by way of contrast, Scorcese has naval cannon firing into the city to set up his climax when that manifestly NEVER happened and, believe me, would be very well known if it ever did.  Oh, and the Five Points was not all the way downtown, but instead up around Union Square, though that is a minor detail (that should have been gotten right anyway).<br/><br/>Here, the movie does not just wander off track, it gallops.  The main characters are engaged in a battle to the death- but we suddenly break away to ten minutes of documentary-style shots (and breathless voiceovers) of draft rioters breaking into Horace Greeley's friends' houses.  The rivalry between the main characters gets cooking - and then we spend time watching Boss Tweed talk about building sewers.  I am a student of history, but I would rather see a straight documentary for facts and a tight movie that sticks to the plot for a fictional tale.  This wound up doing both poorly when, if it had just focused, it could have done either fabulously.<br/><br/>So, I was disappointed.  Daniel Day-Lewis was fabulous, just astonishingly good, and lit the screen up every time he showed up in his preppy pants or wielding his butcher knife.  He was the one thing that made the movie worth my three hours.  Leonardo DiCaprio was ok, frankly I thought he was miscast, never convincing me that he had any kind of vendetta going.  He rather seemed merely to be just going with the flow of the moment.  Cameron Diaz gives a wonderful performance that winds up going nowhere - or, strike that, she winds up going to San Francisco when that has nothing to do with anything.<br/><br/>There were a few things I loved.  The final shots are breathtaking to anyone who loves New York City, as I do, and especially sentimental due to recent events.  Day-Lewis showed me something with his acting despite a lame script. It was nice seeing a depiction of New York City from that period, even if it is only the seediest parts.  And the period atmosphere felt right, although it had a bit too much of an ""Oliver Twist"" or ""Satyricon"" air to it for my taste (the conceit that the lower class back then lived like animals is a bit insulting and almost certainly inaccurate, though it makes for nice dramatic vignettes).<br/><br/>Overall, ""Gangs"" was worth seeing, but not as good as I expected.  It also is extremely violent and not for the squeamish.  An important film that should have been much, much better, especially from talent of this caliber."

","There are films out there that are so intense that it's like a pit bull grabbing at your neck and swinging you around. The entire third act of this film did just that for me. I was sitting there and this intense feeling overtook me while watching. Part of it is that there is just something in my brain that reacts so much more tensely when the violence before me is being dealt out with large crude blades.      I will however admit that some scenes found me just slightly confused... so I'm going to go ahead and work this out loud for anyone who cares to read this character analysis. DiCaprio (Here on out to be referred to as Vallon.) is the son of an obvious man of God. He is brought up to believe in the saints and what they did (St. Michael in particular.) And before the final battle of the film, Vallon is seen praying to God. This may or may not contrast actions taken by him earlier in the film... Vallon immediately throws a bible into a river soon after it was given to him, and tells a priest to go to hell later on when the priest invites him into his congregation. That being said, at first I wondered... Why would Vallon pray to a God he seems to scorn? But at the same time, I also took into consideration that Vallon goes through hell and back by way of a beating distributed by Butcher, that maybe he is humbled by the experience, and thusly returns to his childhood faith. So ultimately I dismiss what seemed at first to be a character flaw. I believe this movie deserves the critical acclaim it has received. There are a lot of films out there that take the time to ruthlessly gut the hell out of everyone onscreen, but there's no emotion involved. You don't care about the loved ones of the victims. This is a movie that made me care. Seeing a son watch his father get dealt death's final blow all the while looking his father's nemesis in the eyes two feet away. I found that extremely emotional. That was just the beginning of the film. The rest of the film is just as involving and never lets up. I give 'Gangs' an A."

It is a sweeping epic of forgotten proportions as Americans and those around the world will be educated in how America, the real America, was built.  Daniel Day-Lewis cannot be praised enough for this film.  His volatile performance as a gang leader who controls politics and law enforcement in 19th century New York is frightening and tragic at the same time.  He never shows any sign of weakness in both his character or his performance.  He was robbed of a second Oscar for 1993's 'In the Name of the Father' and I hope he will get his reward here.  It is truly the best performance by an actor in a leading role in 2002...no question about it.  Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz are good but not great (Leo is better in 'Catch Me If You Can') and the cast is rounded off with quality turns by Jim Broadbent and John C. Reilly. Attention to period detail is second to none and the editing is put forward in a way that makes three hours just fly by.  The photography and camera movement is fitting to the moment at hand and the violence is graphic but is contained in its most gut wrenching as the film draws to a climax and is part of the story so it belongs there.

","For being one of the most anticipated films of the year, this sure is a let down! When a movie is rumored to have all kinds of trouble on the set it usually means it's not that good after all and this further proves that theory. It's obvious that the troubled film has more than a few screws loose, and sadly enough, the great Martin Scorsese is to blame. Apparently a vanity project that has been in the director's heart for over 30 years, it looks as though this big, bloated disaster will become a great disappointment in the end. At a very slow (almost) 3 hours, the movie just keeps going and going with bothersome inconsistencies popping up all over the place, among many other problems. <br/><br/> Based very loosely on the draft riots of 1863, the characters that did actually exist apparently did not in this particular time frame. It also seems that their costumes did not, either. They appear to be a hybrid of different time periods, although the attention to detail is great, even if misguided. The accents are also distracting, as many of the main characters (save the great Daniel Day-Lewis) slip in and out of them at their leisure, especially the now-beefy Leonardo DiCaprio and miscast Cameron Diaz. The sets look like Old West sets in outer space or something. While mostly filmed on a soundstage in Rome, it doesn't even look close to what New York during that time did. There was supposedly a lot of advisors on the set for authenticity reasons and it paid off to an extent, but a good looking movie is just plain hollow without the right substance. Also, it should be noted that the odd sampled drumbeat and guitar during the opening fight sequence and closing theme song by U2 seem really misplaced. So with all of these distracting elements to take you out of the story, you're left with a generally uninteresting and untrue story about characters you could care less about. There are some characters that even come and go with no explanation as to who they are and why they were ever there.<br/><br/>
 This is a film that is just too big for its own good. There's so much going on that in the end it just seems like there's still a lot left out or unexplained even at its great length. Not to say that it couldn't have been done in the time frame, it was just too unfocused. There are plenty of times where you might find yourself checking your watch or wishing there was a remote with a fast-forward button laying around the theater. Audible groans were heard throughout the press screening I attended. Like I said before, the characters aren't likeable or interesting enough to want to sit through the ho-hum dialogue and the action scenes are just bloody and seem pointless, or at least they're not explained enough to make it engaging. It's not that it's a complete disaster, it's just too dense and overproduced for its own good.<br/><br/> Maybe there was something that I missed in the 25 minutes that were cut from the theatrical release, but this one just didn't seem to connect with me. I was hoping it would engage, excite, or entice me, but it really just made me wish I could get that three hours of my life back. Not to say that it was a complete waste of time, I just know it could've been a lot better and it saddens me. It's a shame, really. I was looking forward to this one."

The director went out of his way to prove a point in which he stopped short and half-assed his intention. He should have shown the buildings disappear like they did on September 11th. Just because directors have computer animation at their disposal does not and should not constitute them to use it every chance they get especially when it looks unrealistic. The ending was the straw that broke the camel's back. The movie was cast at the most extreme ends of the spectrum of professionalism. What went through Scorsese's head when he decided to give Leonardo DiCaprio the lead part sharing with Daniel Day Lewis? Lewis was brilliant and DiCaprio was pathetic. Scorsese spent three hours building a story with detail and passion only to scrap the project by giving DiCaprio the lead role and placing one of the most horrible endings in film history.

","It's good to know that Daniel Day-Lewis remains one of the finest actors in movies; his performance as ""the Butcher"" will live in my memory. Even his dialect was carefully worked out and is apparently as faithful to what we know of the NYC dialect of that era as it can be. His work is so strong and fine that it makes the choice of Leonardo DiCaprio for the other lead all the more unfortunate. DiCaprio has shown that he can act, given the right material and setting (Catch Me If You Can, for example), but I simply couldn't suspend my disbelief to the point where I could accept him as tough enough to stand up to ""the Butcher,"" or charismatic enough for the Irish to rally around. There was something terminally callow in his work, for my taste, and that, of course, has to be a major drawback in this extremely ambitious and frequently fascinating movie. Visually, Scorsese has achieved something remarkable: he has given us a stunning picture of the seamiest part of New York City in the mid-nineteenth century, one that tallies remarkably well with the images I've seen, and seems to come straight out of Luc Sante's wonderful book, Low Life. Also, the movie speaks effectively to a point made by the character--Mr. Schermerhorn, I believe--who says that it's always possible to pay half the poor of the city to kill the other half. Ultimately, both the nativists and the immigrants, Irish and others, constantly at each others' throats, were the victims of the wealthy merchants and politicians who generally managed to stay safely uptown, out of the muck. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD)I wish that the Draft Riots had been more central to the plot or, at least, had been dealt with more straightforwardly. The movie gives rather short shrift to the race hatred that was a central motivation to the rioters. Most of the riot's victims, after all, were black--until the military took their toll. I thought that giving Amsterdam and his allies one black friend seemed an attempt to duck an unpalatable fact: just as the nativists loathed the Irish, those Irish newcomers loathed the blacks who, they believed, were costing them their livelihood. There's a false note there. I had initially felt that the climactic battle didn't provide what I'd wanted--a knockdown brawl between the Butcher and Amsterdam, but, on reflection, I decided that that was exactly the point. Both those characters, as well as their allies, were equally victims of the prevailing political and economic power structure of the time.(END SPOILER) On balance, I recommend this movie on the strengths of Daniel Day-Lewis's stunning performance and the magnificent recreation of New York City's lower depths from a long-dead era.

","GANGS OF NEW YORK [R] Running Time, 3 hours: 10 minutes (with trailers)<br/><br/>Starring: Leonardo Dicaprio Cameron Diaz Daniel Day-Lewis<br/><br/>	It had been one hell of a week to go to the movies. First, came the release of The Two Towers, the much-anticipated Lord Of The Rings sequel. Now we have Martin Scorsese's new film, Gangs Of New York. It stars Leonardo Dicaprio (Titanic), Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels), and Daniel Day-Lewis (The Last Of The Mohicans). This film has had a lot of buzz generated about it lately. Some from the fact that is being released against another Dicaprio film in another week, Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. But also due to the fact that Gangs looks to be one of the year's finest motion pictures. And currently, probably the best film playing next to The Two Towers. Unfortunately, none of our local cinemas have received a print of it. In fact, I saw in Burlington yesterday. However, we may be lucky enough within the upcoming weeks to see it one of our local marquees. Until then, I guess you'll just have to wait unless you are willing to see it Montreal, or Burlington. 	Taking place in New York City during the mid-1800s amidst the upcoming Civil War, it tells the story of a young Irish-man named Amsterdam Vallon who witnessed his father's death as a boy in a rough area of New York called The Five Points. His father, played by Liam Neeson, is an Irish Priest and leads the other Irish against the a rival gang in the New York at the time headed by Daniel Day-Lewis's character, Bill the Butcher. After witnessing his father's demise at the hand of Bill the Butcher, Amsterdam is sent to an orphanage, and when he gets old enough he sets out on his own with the intention of getting revenge for his father's death. Amsterdam allies himself with Bill the Butcher, and learns how to handle the tough streets of the Five Points. Along the way, he meets a beautiful woman played by Cameron Diaz, called Jenny Everdeane. Jenny is a pickpocket and is Amsterdam's love interest in the film. However, as time goes on and Amsterdam and Jenny become closer, a friend of Amsterdam's named Johnny Sirocco, played by Henry Thomas (E.T., All The Pretty Horses) and also in love with Jenny, finds out about the affair between Amsterdam and Jenny. Johnny, filled with jealousy sells Amsterdam out to Bull the Butcher, who did not realize that Amsterdam was the son of the Irish priest he killed so many years before. Now the battle lines are being drawn between the natives of New York and Irish, blacks, and other immigrants who make up the rival faction of Amsterdam, called the Dead Rabbits. 	The film is truly stunning. As stated before, it takes place against the Civil War and declaration of the draft by Lincoln. New York City was in chaos at the time with rioters and looters protesting the war. It actually led to Marshall Law being declared in the city. The film portrays these scenes with great precision and accuracy. Another great quality of the film is it's set design, which is immense and there is no digital affect here that isn't real. What you see, is what you get in this film, and we see quite a bit. The performances are superb from every member of the cast. I can't think of a single one to complain about. Also, the music used in the film is very good, as well. It contains some score composed by Academy Award winning composer, Howard Shore (Lord Of The Rings). U2 does a song, which doesn't appear in the film, but probably during the end credits and on the soundtrack called, `The Hands That Built America.' Not to mention the countless other pieces music that are used in the film; traditional folk songs from all walks of life  most notably Celtic music. Scorsese did a wonderful job directing this film, and is quite possibly one of the best, if not the best film of year. However, I'm cautious to say that Gangs Of New York is the best film of the year because there is still another film, at least on my list, that is note worthy to see: Catch Me If You Can, also starring Leonardo Dicaprio. ****"
"StarCastle99","10","0","0","30 December 2002"," A Film to Be Taken Seriously
","Gangs of New York is an extraordinary piece of filmaking. It embodies more scope than any of Scorcese's other pictures, but in doing so, sacrifices some intimate detail. Be warned, the film is not for the faint of heart. It is extremely violent, but must be so to capture the time in which it takes place. Daniel Day Lewis certainly deserves a nomination, as does it's director. Costume, Set (What a set!!), Cinematography are all nomination level. Although I'm pretty well educated it covers a period about which I knew very little. Do buy a ticket and see what epic filmaking is all about. Don't try to compare it to ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""Ben Hur"" since those are films were made in another era and are not comparable. Scorcese is worthy of the term ""artist""; it's unfortunate that LOFR is causing the picture to tank at the Box Office. Maybe word of mouth will save it; it will certainly find a new financial life in DVD/VHS. Unfortunately, those who wait for the home video release, will never realize the power of the cinematic screen. 5/5"

","Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest filmmakers of our time.  His films have had an immense impact on cinema due to their sheer brilliance.  Let me start by sharing my view towards his films.  My top five Scorsese pictures are as follows.  1.Taxi Driver, 2.Raging Bull, 3.Casino, 4.Bringing out the Dead, &<br/><br/>5.Goodfellas.  Some agree with this list, some don't. Gangs of New York has finally been released.  I saw this film opening night at the lovely Grove theatre with a sold out audience.  It has taken five days to form a solid review.   The first thing that must be said is that this film is MORE THAN JUST THE BEST PICTURE OF THE YEAR, IT""S ONE OF THE GREATEST EPIC'S OF OUR TIME.  This is a film of much importance to anyone who cares about cinema.  Scorsese and his team have created a fascinating story of a time and place in American history, told through a masterfully constructed plot of revenge.  This is the story of the five points, a place long forgotten in New York history.<br/><br/>I'm going to skip any further details of the story, most of you know this already. This film is historical.  This is cinema at its finest. For me,  Gangs of New York is a masterpiece that will live forever. Every frame that was seen will never be forgotten.  This is carved in my memory forever, it is that good.  Leonardo DiCaprio is a brilliant actor.  Forget what you've seen from him, it's nothing compared to this.  Amsterdam Vallon is on the screen the entire time.  Not once did I see DiCaprio, this performance is seamless.<br/><br/>It's time for Oscar to come his way.  Many people might not think it's that good,...I do.  The balance between subtle touches and complete rage is quite impressive.  I respect DiCaprio as an actor and suggest you do as well.  Daniel Day-Lewis, well,......holy god! Bill the Butcher is one of the greatest characters of all time.  This role makes it clear that Daniel Day-Lewis is on par with Robert De Niro.  This is flawless.  Cameron Diaz is the pleasant surprise of this film.  I knew she was talented, but this truly shows her range.  I loved this character.  The supporting cast is perfect.  From John C. Reily to the brilliant Liam Neeson. This is a film with amazing power.  Every sequence is important, always presenting cinematic art.  (Minor Spoilers)<br/><br/>Watch for the growing relationship between Amsterdam and the Butcher.  A great scene with Bill wearing an American flag, the entire sequence when Bill discovers Amsterdam's plot, a great love scene with Amsterdam and Jenny, and the incredible finale. These are a few scenes of the many.  This is what makes this film so special. I'm going to wrap this up.  Now that this film is here, Scorsese proves his genius is still alive and well.  Forget the few mixed/negative reviews.  I don't understand it.  They don't appreciate important films when released.  However, in ten or twenty years,  watch their opinions change.  My top five Scorsese > films have changed now.  I can't say this is better than Taxi Driver or Raging Bull, but I simply love it more.  I will watch this film more than those two.  It has had a greater impact on me than those films, which is saying a lot.  Gangs of New York is special.  No matter how you view his films, IT""S ONE OF HIS VERY BEST & MY PERSONAL  FAVORITE.  I hope this gets the awards it deserves."

Many of the viewers seemed to be New York transplants to Hawaii and were there to catch a glimpse of home.  They left disappointed and sleepy-eyed.<br/><br/>Anyway, about 2/3 of the way through, I started to laugh at the hilarious lines of D. D.-Lewis for comic relief from the wandering, boring plot.

","intertwined between a hodgepodge of story lines.  There are just way too many story lines to follow. You have all the politics, all the varies gangs, and racism even thrown in.  This movie, which centers around revenge, fails when compared to a great revenge story like Gladiator.  If the story had just stuck with LD trying to get DDL back for killing his father, it would have been much better and shorter.  I just could not get into the plot as much as I could with other epic movies.<br/><br/>DDL is really good as Bill the Butcher and deserves to be nominated for acting awards. But, I didn't think to much of LD and CD's attempts at Irish accents.  Sometimes it sounded like they had them and other times the accent was lost.<br/><br/>As for the opening battle scene between the 2 gangs, it wasn't that great. I have heard it compared to scenes from Braveheart and Gladiator, but it was no where near as good. You couldn't see much of what was going on because of the short camera shots that skipped around, and there was no where near as much as blood and gore as there was in Braveheart or Gladiator.<br/><br/>
(SPOILERS): As for the final, there isn't much of a pay off. We want to see LD really kick the crap out of DDL and knife him up like DDL had done to so many people throughout the movie.  But, instead, DDL is wounded by a bomb, and all LD has to do is use his knife. There isn't much of a fight between them.  The ending should have been more climatic.  And as for the bombing, I didn't really understand why the ships were shooting bombs at the place where the gangs were going to fight because that was not where the mob was. Just another complaint that makes the story hard to follow and not too good.(END OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:  I wouldn't say this is bad, just average. I would just skip it at the theater because it is so long.  But, DDL makes it worth watching if you can catch it on cable some time.  Just don't expect a great story."

I thought Scorcese did an excellent job and although I am no fan of Leo, he wasn't all that bad.  Of course Daniel Day Lewis was great and the supporting actors were excellent.<br/><br/>It was nice for once to see a historical movie of epic proportions that wasn't just a jingoistic postcard and showed America in all the nasty xenophobic and blood & guts glory.  And it allows you to draw parallels with current events and our own little xenophobia and political crimes of today, which is what good history should do no matter what Henry Ford said. Perhaps there was a bit too much gratuitous violence but then again can you really sugar-coat a Civil War battle or a lynch mob or just the mob in general?  Everybody was a villain in the film, just as often in real life there are no real heros to look up to.  Leo's character ""Amsterdam"" was every bit as bloodthirsty as Lewis' Bill Cutting; if not worse since at least Bill fights in hand-to-hand combat while Leo prefers to sneak up through the ranks and presumably pull an ""inside job.""<br/><br/>It's just too bad that so many people just looking for the latest ""shock & grab"" miss some of the bigger themes of the movie; yet they presumably find all sorts of ""meaningful"" things in ""Eight Mile"" and LOTR."

","I never was a big Daniel Day-Lewis fan, but I must say, he gives a great performance in this movie. In fact, they should just hand over the Best Actor Oscar to him now instead of waiting until March 2003 to give it to him.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis plays one of the greatest villains in movie history. Complex, dark, and some-what likeable, his portrayal of Bill the Butcher is the main reason to see this movie. Day-Lewis' acting is magnetic and powerful--and it draws you into the movie even more. You don't want him to lose; then again, you don't want him to win either. You are torn over this character and it is all because Day-Lewis does such an amazing job in making this character three-dimensional. Sometimes, the villains are the ones you want to root for (like Denzel Washington in Training Day).<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has created another classic to add to his already illustrious career. Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, and Jim Broadbent round out a great cast in a story about the roots of America's greatest city--New York.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York shows that America was built on the blood, sweat, and tears of its people. Blood was spilled on the streets for many reasons: honor, money, and to force people to live and conform to a certain way of life. For years the blood-shed had no real purpose or direction, and then the politicians came and started to use these gangs to their advantage.<br/><br/>Like in all of his films, Scorsese really doesn't try to preach at you. He shows you the events and allows you to make the decisions of right and wrong; good or bad. Before I saw this movie, I thought this was going to be another showdown-revenge movie between rival gangs. . .but in the end, I realized it was more than that.<br/><br/>The biggest gang of them all was the United States government and the politicians. The government did the same things the local street gangs were doing--lie, cheat, and steal--but on a greater scale.<br/><br/>Many people fear change and try to stand in the way of progress. But the movie shows that no one can stop change; and those who try to end progress are pushed aside into history.<br/><br/>This movie gets my highest recommendation."
"jjucovy","Null","0","0","25 December 2002"," Stylized and silly
","Scorcese continues to have style, as other recent films of his have demonstrated.  But like with those films, he really doesn't seem to have much of a reason to be making movies anymore, except to display his flair with the camera.  The story here is utterly banal and Scorcese's decision to base the plot on real historical events only makes the movie more annoying. Scorcese also cannot himself from falling victim to a film code that is apparently inviolable now-- his chief protagonist just happens to be an Irish-American devoid of any racial prejudice, going so far as to befriend African-Americans.  That this fictional protagonist should display such far-sighted tolerance in a film that has the New York City anti-Black draft riots as a backdrop only adds to the irritating silliness of the plot. Scorcese would be a little more interesting if he had dared to feature a racist as the hero (and if he had done a fade-out of the WTC in the silly scene that appears in the movie).  The film drags, but there are some fun moments."

Although I thoroughly enjoyed the film, It fell way short of it's potential.<br/><br/>Having read two excellent books on the period, (The Gangs of New York and Low Life), I felt that of all the colorful characters of that time and stories that could have been told, this films simple story of revenge and love was pretty unworthy of such an epic undertaking.<br/><br/>The two real strengths of the movie were the sets and Daniel Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher. The Five Points neighborhood of New York where this film takes place, (all traces of which have long since been completely removed, even to the point that the streets do not even come to five points any longer), vividly comes back to life on film. The director made a great effort to recreate the street life as it would have looked back then. The only flaw, was that the scenes that took place at night, showed the streets completely deserted, like some sleepy little village, which it was not.<br/><br/>The other strength, Danial Day Lewis as Bill the Butcher, was a great character played by a great actor and hence the only character with any depth. Even though he portrayed the villain, he was the only character I really cared about.<br/><br/>In conclusion I think this is an important film, because it touches on a part of American history that alot of people don't know much about.

","After seeing this film, i feel compelled to speak of its brilliance, for it was such.  First and foremost, the acting was absolutely stellar.  Daniel Day-Lewis gave one of the finest performances of his illustrious career, if not one of the best all time.  Additionally, Cameron Diaz, with such a wonderful portrayal of her character, proved to us all that she is not just eye-candy, but also has a knack for acting.  Although his role was minor, Lliam Nielson did an excellent job in setting the tone for the rest of the movie, as it was set around his death.  Unfortunately, Leonardo Di Caprio was once again dealt with a performance that was overshadowed by his fellow characters and drowned out by the brilliance of the film.  Not to say that the performance was not worthy of praise, though.  furthermore, the cinematography was brilliant.  it really did convey to the audience a feel of complete disarray in a state of complete and immutable anarchy that the film was set.  not only was the scenery magnificent, but so was the score. The composer did an impeccable job in establishing a sort of folksy Irish feel that was essential to comprehending the plot of the film.  The memorable opening sequence combined these two factors ever masterfully, to say the least.  Yet again, Martin Scorsese has shown the nation why he is such a revered film-maker.  Never has a director done a better job in informing the audience on the history of his topic, while overseeing the making of such a high-quality film. Whatever caused the delay in release of Gangs of New York, it was well worth the wait.  10/10.  An absolute work of art."

The costumes, locations, everything  extremly convinces you that this IS industrialized America you are witnessing. But you feel that you aren't just witnessing life in industrialized America, you feel that you're witnessing a guy, more or less like you (provided your a male of coarse) who is devastated at the loss of his father (which causes him to be less like just about any of you).  You feel like you're witnessing this man constantly pondering whether or not to avenge his father's death.  As if there's a telepathic bond between you and him, you're telling him:""kill that son of a b!tc#. The acting is superb.  Cameron Diaz transitions excellently from fairy tale Princess (Shrek), to street wise hooker/theif/""turtle dove"" (that's...what kind of role she plays after all) and is entirely convincing. Leonardo DeCaprio is good for some parts of the film and is perfect for annoying love scenes, HOWEVER, DECAPRIO ISN'T CUT OUT TO BE A HISTORIC BARBARIAN, HE DEFINATLY NOT AS STREET WISE AS EMINEM IN 8 MILE.  DANILLE DAY-LEWIS (as Bill the Butcher), HOWEVER, TURNS IN ONE OF THE BEST PERFORMANCES IN A LONG TIME (since Fellowship of the Ring perhaps).  He's the perfect villan, he maintains eye contact with who he's speaking to, he speaks his line like he means them, he acts his part enthusiastically, he's simply brilliant! The violence is startlingly high.  MARTIN SCORSESE IS TRUELY A MASTER AT DEPICTING VIOLENCE (see Taxi Driver and you'll know what I  mean).  The first fight scene between the natives and the original dead rabbits is brutal and well choreographed (excellent camera shots).  The later fight scene between the revived dead rabbits and the natives is even bloodier, yet confusing.  There are too many things going on at once and the shroud of smoke makes it even more confusing.<br/><br/>Overall, the only thing keeping this film from perfection is the confusion the last battle scene causes and the scene with all the nude hookers (we would have gotten the idea that they were hookers even if they were dressed).

","One thing can be guaranteed, you will never see another film like Gangs of New York.  It's visually astounding, the performances are incredibly complex and nuanced, and Scorsese's unique approach to filmmaking is undeniable.   Leo isn't a hero, he's a vulnerable, confused, and complicated human being.  The same goes for Cameron Diaz, Henry Thomas, and DD Lewis. And anybody who says Daniel Day is just ""hamming it up"" has no understanding of method acting.  His performance is on par with Brando in The Godfather and Orson Welles in Citizen Kane. The actors are not just archetypes, as is so typical with Hollywood films; they are complex and complicated humans who seem vulnerable, confused, and yet still driven by their beliefs. All of the negative reviews seem to be because people expected to find a Gladiator type revenge story.   If you're only interested in a witty story or clever plot development, go rent Usual Suspects or Double Indemnity, and shut up.  Martin Scorsese has created a WORLD with this film, not just a story.  What he was trying to convey is what New York and America was actually like in the 1860's, and not just wow you with clever storytelling.   This is a very dense film exporing every nook and cranny of a very complex place, and it will definitely require multiple viewings to fully digest the vast scope of this film, but the result is undeniable.  Scorsese has created not just a story, but a world.  If you're looking for mere storytelling, you're short changing yourself.  Scorsese has shown America an ugly part of it's history that shouldn't be forgotten. Leo's voice-over sums it up best.  ""It wasn't so much a city, as a cauldron in which a city might someday be forged.""  The last line is incredibly poignant.  Leo says ""for the rest of time, it would be like no one ever even knew we was here"".  Well, thanks to Marty Scorsese, now everyone will know the story of the immigrants in New York and the story of how modern America was born from so much tribulation.  Hat's off to Mr. Scorsese.

Looking at our watches, we decided we couldn't stand another hour and twenty minutes of this film.<br/><br/>The film is overly graphic when it doesn't need to be, and seems to abandon its strong goals to tell a father-son story to be hip and edgy.  Scorcese has always been a little edgy, and I think producer Weinstein may have had some say in the MTV-esqe cutting of this, a period drama(?). Toward the beginning, there's a crucial battle scene between the two warring ""tribes"" of an unruly section of New York.  In this fight, the lens is splattered with blood, the carpeted snow can be seen curling up, and at times, people are cut without bleeding.  Despite these mistakes, the battle is simply needlessly graphic, and almost campy.  During one moment in which a long-nailed shrewish woman dives on a man, only to surface holding a bloody ear, my friend (unaware of Scorcese) said, ""[This director's] a Peter Jackson wannabe,"" recalling Jackson's earlier work, Dead Alive (1992), the ""goriest horror flick ever made"".  And while I admonished him for his ignorance, he had a point.  The movie almost was a callback to Australian camp horror flicks.<br/><br/>And what about the pointless, graphic nudity?  Being a 17-year-old male, I am definitely not adverse to naked women, but there's a time and a place in films.  I turned to my friends during a particularly violent part and said sarcastically, ""What this movie needs is some gratuitous nudity.""  Voila! Two minutes later, we were given a scene in a brothel, complete with dozens of topless women.  During the scene, no dialog really suggested that this scene needed to take place in said location, but it did.  Eh, it probably has a point I'm missing, right?<br/><br/>Overall, give me your criticisms and your flak.  After all, I only saw about half of the movie.  What do I know?  Maybe this ultraviolent, bland, techno-music sporting period piece is worthy of some Oscar nods.  But honestly, mixing together Eyes Wide Shut, A Clockwork Orange, and Braveheart with a revenge story seems kind of horrid.<br/><br/>FINAL RATING: 5 / 10<br/><br/>P.S.  Scorcese references his student film ""A Close Shave"" with the opening shot of a man shaving.  Thought this might interest some."

","This film has just about everything - violence, blood, murder, hookers, sex, drugs, betrayal, revenge, and salvation.  The only thing it doesn't have is a strong plot.  Still it is worth seeing as a `slice of life' of  urban, lower class white society in the mid-nineteenth century.<br/><br/>Set against the backdrop of the corruption of Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall and the Civil War, it depicts the social struggle of native born English-Americans against Irish immigrants.  Forget Leo!  Daniel Day-Lewis, who plays the bad guy, steals this whole movie and is a shoe-in for a Best Actor nomination.<br/><br/>The thing I loved about this film - and any American history buff will - is that it brings attention to an event that ""the authorities"" have kept in the closet , The New York Draft Riots (June, 1863)!<br/><br/>After the costly victory at Gettysburg, the Union needed fresh cannon fodder and established its first draft lottery.  However, you could legally buy your way out of it for $300 - much to the chagrin of poor whites.  This single fact p***ed them off worse than the draft did and for almost a week, over 100,000 demonstrators rioted .  Forget about Southern lynching. More blacks were probably hung from light poles in New York than were oak trees in Alabama.  The police and army responded with equal violence. President Lincoln was so horrified by the reports, he ordered that no official death toll be kept.<br/><br/>Interesting to note that 100 years later, the govt. still hadn't learned their lesson when another unpopular war resulted in a draft where deferment could be obtained even easier - just by enrolling in college!<br/><br/>BTW, even the Twin Towers get a cameo in this film."

","Oh Marty Scorcese!<br/><br/>Well, I finally saw it and I must say the word I came away with was: empty. Now the movie had a lot going for it and for the first hour I was hooked but there were several things that ended up working against it:<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis's performance while technically excellent was dry and left me wanting for emotion. This was a man who exemplified the very core of everything I hate yet somehow I didn't hate him. More often than not he reminded me of Dustin Hoffman in 'Hook,' although Hoffman was meaner.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio's performance ,however, was very raw and emotionally charged despite his wavering Irish accent. His scenes are some of the more impressive along with Henry Thomas' amazing turn, he only continues to grow as an actor and is truly underrated.<br/><br/>Where Gangs of New York suffers is towards the end. First, off it loses momentum by taking 30 to 40 minutes too long to end.<br/><br/>The backdrop of the draft riots get too involved in the film and nearly ruin it.<br/><br/>The confrontation between Amsterdam and Cutting is too short.<br/><br/>Then there's a corny closing images meaning the graves with bad CGI, and this cost 97 million dollars?<br/><br/>While the opening sequence of the film is fantastic and is what keeps you going. Scorcese leaves you wanting in the action sequences. Only showing you effect and not cause. If it were not for the importance of the scene and the good cutting it would've been a waste. He improves some in the  middle but at the end shows but a little.<br/><br/>While it's one of those films you know could end in 5 minutes. Gangs of New York is a film that could've been great that missed the mark. 6/10"

","I have just come back from ""Gangs of New York"" and, low and behold, after turning on the TV and surf the net, Scorcese's ""Casino"" is on. Interesting to compare the two, as they are essentially the same kind of film<br/><br/>""Gangs,"" as it turns out, is a minor Scorcese film that wants to be a great one. It lacks drive and dimension and, worst of all, substance. Words, always an important part of a Scorcese film, are usually delivered with a force and reckoning similar to the staccato of machineguns but in ""Gangs"" are dull and plodding. Only Day Lewis can manage to lift his character above the material (but then again bad guys always play better on film), whereas, DiCaprio and Diaz are woefully miscast.<br/><br/>This film contains all of the standard elements that Scorcese is known for, a worthy soundtrack, narration (but only by one character this time), editing by Shoonmaker, cinematography by Ballhouse, a decent set of actors, a script by Zaillian, but something went wrong somewhere. A quick scan of the credits and one could see why -- too many writers and way too many producers. And it probably didn't help that the film was shot in Italy (no disrespect intended to the fine Italian crew). But the film felt off-center from right after the opening fight which killed ""Priest"" and never regained form. Liam Neeson had a terrific presence -- its too bad he got killed after the first 15 minutes. Perhaps a way should have been found to keep him around until the first half and then shortened everything else. Perhaps then the movie would have had better pace.<br/><br/>The movie also feels like many, many scenes and/or characters wound up on the cutting room floor or, even worse, tried to be saved in the editing room. Let's face it; this film got the better of a great director."

If you are against blood and don't like killings and beatings then this is definitely not your movie.

","I imagine that this was a really fine book and I imagine a rather long book as well. Hence the problem with this film. There is too much too tackle and not enough time. The result is a movie that has you wondering why some stuff was included and other stuff omitted. The movie itself is not bad, Scorscese is too talented to make a bad film. However, whereas ""Goodfellas"" tackled a long and detailed story completely, ""Gangs"" looks like it was butchered in the edit. Daniel Day Lewis is good and Diaz and DiCaprio are fair, but several of the other actors were never given a chance to develop at all. The sets are great and for a history buff, the movie hits the spot. However, as far as standard enjoyment pleasure, this one is lacking. Nice try, Marty."

You get your fill and more of filthy degraded men finding new and innovative ways to kill and brutalize other men.

Personally i am a huge Martin Scorsese fan and i have seen every movie he has made and am fully aware that he is not perfect (kundun).  But this is a great film. The movie is a revenge story set in the backdrop of 19th century New York.  I read the book Gangs of New York and i think that the creative team of dante ferretti and sandy powell really helped recreate 19th century New York. The performances in the film were good all around.  The Cameron Diaz storyline took away from the revenge between Amsterdam (dicaprio) and bill the butcher (day-lewis).  Daniel Day-Lewis gives the best performance on screen since kevin spacey in american beauty.  It is hard to imagine that willem dafoe and robert de niro, as great as they are, were considered to this role so perfect for day-lewis.  This is the greatest historical epic that i have seen and in my opinion it is better than the recent gladiator and braveheart.  We all know that scorsese will win his oscar this year because they now give it as a career achievement but the question is how many more will it win?   I give this film my highest rating 10/10 and i think everyone, especially new yorkers, should see this movie."

","It saddens me that some younger audience members who went to see Gangs of New York have short attention span - constantly fiddling, twentysomething couples making out and getting up in the middle of the movie for restrooms and refreshments. This movie, despite starring Leonardo DiCaprio, is NOT similar to Titanic, another semi-historical fiction film. Both movies are different and unique. Scorsese's vision is far more terrifyingly realistic and violent than Cameron's vision of historical tragedy and doomed romance.<br/><br/>
That said, Gangs of New York does have its share of flaws - just like Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line which is one of my favorite films - but frankly who cares about what the majority of film critics have to complain that this film is the best of the best in Scorsese's career on par with good but overrated films Raging Bull and Goodfellas? For the record, my favorite movies directed by Scorsese are Taxi Driver and the criminally underrated The King of Comedy. As a matter of fact, Gangs of New York is Scorsese's best film yet in my humble opinion. <br/><br/>Admittedly dissecting the films looking for flaws is my thing but I will make exception to Gangs of New York because it packs an emotional and visceral wallop courtesy of the universally perfect production design, costuming, cinematography, music and sound effects. I won't comment on Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz's acting, as they served the story adequately, but Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Bill the Butcher truly stands out as one of the most realistic and complex villains ever depicted in the history of film. Nothing will beat Daniel's tour de force role as a ruthlessly evil and racist anti-immigrant leader for years to come because Daniel literally gets into the character without the usual over-the-top sneering, sniveling, cackling and common wicked expressions that stereotypical movie bad guys have. <br/><br/>I have read Herbert Asbury's book and the film have met and even exceeded my expectation. I could go on writing about the film adaption of Gangs of New York, but I simply don't have the time nor the mental effort to write a lengthy review dissecting the film. Scorsese's vision would be a fully realized masterpiece with little or no discernable flaws if he had been given the final cut option from Miramax under Harvey Weinstein, but I won't argue that the theatrical cut of Gangs of New York is his director's cut - there won't be an extended film at all and I respect Scorsese's decision after going through the torturous editing process and meeting the deadline.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, Daniel Day Lewis, the screenwriters and the production crew will most certainly earn their just acclaim come Oscar award time after having Scorsese left humiliated one too many times in losing streak."
"Moshe Kam","Null","0","0","25 December 2002"," This movie is about the sets
","`Gangs of New York' is a little bit like a Verdi Opera.  Yes, there is a story, and often very dramatic and tragic at that.  However, the story really does not matter.  In Verdi's case, the travails of the heroes and the exact logic behind the events are just background to the main goal  the music and the singing.  In `Gangs' the protagonists do not sing (though one wish they did, it would have made for a much more interesting film); still the main accomplishment here is not the story or the (very inaccurate) telling of New York's history.  This movie is primarily about the sets.  It tries to convey an atmosphere, a certain ambience, the street scenery of New York of the 1860s as imagined or wished by Scorsese (from all available evidence we know that New York of the Civil War era did not resemble at all what we are shown in `Gangs').  So  never mind that the houses in `Gangs' miss a front wall to allow us to peek inside; never mind that Daniel Day-Lewis plays the frightening' arch-villain `Bill the Butcher' as if Bill were a bumbling buffoon (with a Peter Falk New York accent to boot); never mind that all characters are flat, totally predictable, and stereotypical. Also, while this is not the first time that Scorsese's plots `do not make sense', at least in his other movies (notably the hilarious `After Hours') you were supposed to care.  Here the contradictions do not really matter. Once you understood that this movie is first and foremost about the aesthetics of the scenery, `Gangs of New York'  with it mob and bar scenes, the riots, and the elephants in the streets  literally looks very impressive."

Dern got death threats for his impertinence.<br/><br/>  Well, we don't see it in this movie - but we ought to.  Amsterdam (Leonardo diCaprio) attempts to shoot Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) during a gathering.   Bill just found out that his almost-adopted son is really the son of his most formidable opponent, ""Priest"" Vallon, who he killed over a decade before.   It doesn't take a genius to know that Amsterdam will just keep coming after the Butcher if he gets the chance, and the Butcher is no fool.<br/><br/>   Keep in mind, too, Bill became king of the Five Points area by being a ruthless sadist, imposing visceral fear on all those around him - who are just as vicious as he is, if a lot less stylish.<br/><br/>  Bill has Amsterdam thrown down on a table.  Does he kill him?  Does he mutilate him severely, at least make him useless to Cameron Diaz, if you know what I mean?<br/><br/>  Nah!   He can't do that!  This is Leonardo diCaprio!  So he burns him on the cheek with the tip of his knife and lets him go.  Soon the burn looks like a cute little sunburn scar.<br/><br/>  And then the final climatic duel.  If you could put diCaprio and Day-Lewis completely in character, and have them fight it out and script be damned, who would you bet on?   Well, my money would be solidly on Day-Lewis/Bill. He showed so much more potency than diCapiro/Amsterdam.  But we know characters' displayed ability doesn't win contests in movies - box office appeal does, and that's why the duel turns out the way it does.<br/><br/>

","Gangs of New York is a very powerful historical drama done on a grand scale. It chronicles a little-known period of deep violent social disturbance during the mid 19th century in New York City, a disturbing time that is usually treated in American history education as a footnote overshadowed by stories of the American Civil War.  But the gangs and anti-draft riots of New York are real history, and this film forces it into our face and makes us see, hear, and feel the time.  It also illustrates the relation between microcosmic problems (of everyday life) and the larger problems of American society and the American state, in much the same way that the novel King Rat did years ago.  It is a remarkable film, a great one, a gift to Americans about their past.  It must have been a lot of work to make, and all those involved deserve congratulations."

I read in a Roger Ebert review that this movie resembles a Dicken's novel. I think that is a very accurate description, as Leonardo Dicaprio (Amsterdam) serves as the eyes and ears of the potential viewer to this colorful, vibrant, run-down, and dirty world that has now since passed into both history and legend. Throughout the movie, doors are constantly kicked and yanked open, thrusting us headfirst into the events that unfurl jarringly before the viewer who is powerless to stop what happens.<br/><br/>This movie also seems to recall a epic filmmaking quality that has either disappeared, or has only existed in a sort of transparent, watered-down form.

","No argument! Martin Scorsese is a wonderful filmmaker, film historian, and a most likable fellow. I like him. I can't help it. Yet, I do not like most of his films. This one is debatably an exception, perhaps saved by inch-fractions primarily by the spellbinding, remorselessly superb acting chops of Daniel Day-Lewis. Curiously he is an Irish actor from Ireland playing an Irish immigrant-hating American of English ancestry, William Cutting, who in real life was no longer living during the final climactic scenes of this film. The shrugs do not end there. Leonardo DiCaprio (now, thankfully, finally, a grown man playing one) plays an Irish American (who struggles with his Irish accent throughout the film).<br/><br/>The film ends with the NYC Draft Riots of 1863. Without drawing up a long list of historical inconsistencies and equivocations, as one example, famed Tribune Editor, Horace Greeley, who was only 52 at the time of these riots, is depicted as a wizened, old man in a long, white beard. In fact, he was only 61 when he died nine years later. Although the chances are that Greeley was brought into the story for his abolitionist views this remains unclear in this release cut of the film. <br/><br/>Generally, this story of the search for vengeance by a boy who sees his father killed during a gang riot never weaves into a full, coherent scenario. The climactic backdrop of the New York City draft riots, in truth were fomented primarily by outraged laborers of mixed nationalities, e.g. of both Irish and German descent, against the importation of poorly paid blacks. These riots that were also given support by the Lincoln hating Tammany Hall-corrupt Democratic Party of the city of that time are not accurately presented here nor clearly melded into the story despite the fast intercuts of flyers and posters of the period. The films' depictions of US Navy Frigates (perhaps on the East River?) firing cannons into Manhattan is news to me, a born New Yorker who has lifelong followed New York history. Toward the end GANGS feels just like what it is a contrivance that upon departing leaves in its wake an empty feeling. <br/><br/>The production values, design, ambiance and atmosphere are handsome. However this film, claimed by some overwrought hype writers, as the ""Birth of New York"" is better described as myopic mayhem. If relentless brutality is your cup of tea, try it. Who knows?

Daniel Day-Lewis slices up an electrifying performance as Bill the Butcher. This is a type of role that is ""prime meat"" for an Oscar nomination, so expect Day-Lewis to deservedly receive a nod when nominations are announced.

This movie pays great attention to detail, and greatly focuses on the persecution of the Irish, something I think alot of people have forgotten. Overall, great film, higly recommended. 10/10"

","I bought into the hype.  I'll admit it.  The advertising campaign for Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York"" swayed me.  I was already listing it with my favorite movies of the year before I'd ever even seen it.  DiCaprio for Best Actor!  Day-Lewis for Best Supporting Actor!  Scorsese for Best Director! Best Picture!<br/><br/>Well, you know what?  After having seen it, I can only say this:<br/><br/>DiCaprio for Best Actor! Day-Lewis for Best Supporting Actor! Scorsese for Best Director! Best Picture! Diaz for Best Supporting Actress! U2 for Best Song!...get the picture?<br/><br/>I expected the film to be excellent, to be sure.  I expected to be blown away by the brutality of the battle sequences and the interaction between great actors.  The film delivered, and in a way I never expected.<br/><br/>I was almost literally moved to tears.  I was one of the last out of the theater today, because I had to keep myself focused on the here-and-now, reassuring myself that there probably never was an Amsterdam Vallon whose father was slain by Bill the Butcher when he was a child.  That the film, based around true events, was set a century-and-a-half ago, and that none of the people who were killed would have lived to see today anyway.<br/><br/>Still, though, Scorsese had me.  He twisted me around his little finger, making me squirm during the bloodshed, tap my feet to the dance, become wide-eyed at the betrayals, and finally utterly crushed by the ending shot, a beautiful bit of demi-time-lapse photography on the growth of New York. It is in these closing moments that I could feel something rising in my throat.  It wasn't a nauseous feeling, unlike some of the battle sequences (which left this usually hard-hearted moviegoer a bit uneasy).  It was genuine emotion.  I was horrified by what man could do and how quickly he could forget.<br/><br/>Scorsese has always seemed to have his finger on the pulse of the nation. How he could have known when this movie was shooting how close the storyline would be to modern events is beyond me.  How he could have known that, on the brink of a war that few want, the youth of the nation (like me) is beginning to find their political voice...<br/><br/>Scorsese, one of the greatest cinematic minds of this or any other time, has once again made a picture that defines its times, intentionally or not.  It is doubtful, however, that the film would not have worked without amazing performances by Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Broadbent (fast becoming my favorite character actor), Henry Thomas, and surprisingly solid performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz (both of whom I had dismissed as ""just another pretty face"" long ago).<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" is, without question, the most important movie of 2002. It was not the most entertaining, though it was certainly entertaining.  It was not the most fun.  It was probably not even the best (I'd wager to put ""Road to Perdition"" a notch above it).  It was, though, the movie that will be remembered nearly thirty years from now, as we remember Scorsese's ""Mean Streets"" and his other cinema classics.  This is the one that will be viewed in film classes for decades to come.<br/><br/>This is, to use a worn-out phrase, a must-see.<br/><br/>Thank you, Mister Scorsese."

","This film could have been named Birth of a Nation, but since that title was already taken Gangs of New York sounds appropriate to me.  With beautiful sets, wonderful acting, and brilliant direction, this  is the one film to see in 2002.<br/><br/>If you are expecting an action packed film then you may leave disappointed. This film has its share of action, but the story of is really about AMERICA. It is about the struggle for people of different cultures learning to accept one another. This is a very powerful film and should be seen by all who respect the ideas that our nation was founded upon. This is with out question the most important film since Schindler's List.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis is superb and the rest of the cast follows his lead. (Leo did quite well with the Irish accent.) The sets are accurate and beautiful. The score is pretty good, and the dialogue is top notch, as always in Marty's films. Martin Scorsese might just win his Best Director Award and get a Best Picture Oscar as well, but either way, this is a can't miss film for serious film buffs.<br/><br/>Some people probably will probably give this film bad reviews, but if you GET IT, you will love it. Those that don't enjoy this film would probably have a hard time sitting through a Taxi Driver or an American Beauty as well.<br/><br/>Simply put; If you love film, then don't miss Gangs."

","After reading some of the early reviews I went into the movie not knowing what to expect. Some were raves, others were picking it apart, many insisted that Leonardo DiCaprio was poorly cast as the film's hero and couldn't hold his own against Daniel Day Lewis.  After seeing it yesterday I'm in agreement with those who say this is a great film. It isn't perfect ... there were a few things that didn't resonate with me, one of which was the final confrontation between the two foes ... but overall I was impressed. The set, the performances ... all top notch, most notably that of the greatly maligned and under-appreciated DiCaprio.  Day Lewis hams it up to the hilt with the aid of props - like a glass eye and a villain's greasy black handlebar mustache.  He bombards the screen armed with showy lines and does a mean Robert DeNiro imitation at times ... but it's DiCaprio who creates a very convincing and very human hero ... a real, living, breathing human man.  This is an actor who can effortlessly express the full range of emotion with little more than a look or a twitch of his face.  He's at once hard and tender, conflicted and determined.  He was everything we could have hoped for as Amsterdam and then some, and reaffirmed my belief that this is the best actor of his generation ... and possibly some other generations as well.  It's easy to create a flashy villain - grade B actors can and do succeed in that endeavor.  DiCaprio's job was more difficult - he had to create a fully dimensioned character with no props other than the dirty rags on his back and he carries it off with power and conviction.  Gangs is a thrilling ride for all of its nearly 3 hours and never felt long or drawn out.  I intend to see it - and enjoy it - again."
"f0o_","Null","0","0","22 December 2002"," Deeply disappointing
","Scorsese works best with character driven movies, these require interesting characters and strong actors, and this movie has neither.  It is just a hodge podge, not very coherent, and the acting is fairly weak (though I have a soft spot for Daniel Day Lewis who is obviously just hamming it up).<br/><br/>
You look at Taxi Driver, Good Fellas, Raging Bull etc. these were about mean, ugly characters, but they were interesting, and more importantly well developed.  The characters in Gangs of New York are cookie cutter.  I don't have really much else to say, but to the people that are fawning over this movie be careful that you aren't just fawning over Scorsese's past work and reading a bit much into this one.  The man is a great director and artist, but even great artists can make junk.<br/><br/>The story line is there in bits and pieces but it never comes together. He should have taken a page from Terrence Mallick and gone all Thin Red Line on it, imagine how much more interesting and exciting it would be."

","Over 20 years in the making, ""Gangs Of New York"" enters theaters with almost overshadowed by the hype and rumours surrounding the production. From the supposed arguments between director Martin Scorcese and producer Harvey Weinstein; Leonardo DiCaprio's apparent off camera antics that slowed production and Daniel Day-Lewis' complete immersion in the role. When the release date was pushed back twice things did not look good, however, I am pleased to write that ""Gangs Of New York"" is not only Scorcese's best film since ""GoodFellas"", but ranks among his best work ever.<br/><br/>The film starts with a nice cameo role by Liam Neeson, as young Amsterdam's (DiCaprio) father, getting his Irish gang ready to battle William Cutting (Day- Lewis) and his gang of ""natives"" for control of Five Points an area that in the mid-1800s has become a cauldron of immigrants all claiming their right to the land. There are no guns, just blades, not shiny and new, but sharp and steady with age, and soon the white snow is red with blood and Amsterdam's father is dead before his eyes at the hands of William ""Bill The Butcher"" Cutting.<br/><br/>Fast forward sixteen years and Amsterdam is out of reform school, unrecognizable with a settle to score. Five Points is not the neighbourhood it was as it is now under the fist of Bill the Butcher, who for lack of a better word, is early kind of mob leader. Every grift, hustle, whore and score sees a payment go into his pocket. However, as the occupants of Five Points battle each other,<br/><br/>America is preparing to go to war with itself, drafting immigrants as they come off the boat (all told in a truly remarkable sequence).<br/><br/>As Amsterdam learns the ways of Five Points, he joins Bill the Butcher's fold, at first to seek his revenge, however, not recognizing the older Amsterdam, Bill takes him under his wing and he is soon taken by the easy influence, power and money at his command. The closer he gets, the more conflicted he becomes, and equally, Bill is seeing the world around him change. No longer can brute force rule, but votes are now becoming harder than bullets and his allegiances with the powers-that-be, who once turned the other way to his indiscretions, are now at jeopardy.<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" is a near perfect film, moving from the microscopic view of a neighbourhood to a wider scope of a nation on the brink of war. The performances are great and Daniel Day-Lewis is spectacular as Bill the Butcher, and he will doubt garner Oscar attention. However, it is flawed. Cameron Diaz's character, who's heart has the eyes of no less than three men, is not given enough screen time and there is even more we wish to know about Bill the Butcher, perhaps more of a backstory to account for his motivations.<br/><br/>Scorcese's ambition and assuredness behind the camera makes these flaws quickly disappear. There is so much contained in here - from the lush costume detail to the street vernacular of 1800s New York - you wish the film, despite it's three hour running time, would keep going. This is a world one wishes to linger in just a bit longer. Much has been made of the editing of this film, some saying that is what sparked disagreements between Scorcese and Weinstein.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, Scorcese has said there will not be a director's cut DVD, but here's hoping he reconsiders.<br/><br/>10/10"

"RunPepe","8","0","0","21 December 2002"," ""He makes the best f***ing films!"" - King Missile, ""Martin Scorsese""
","Honestly, I think despite the praise (and the demerits) it's getting, ""Gangs of New York"" is still underrated and misunderstood. Scorsese says so much about so many things in this film, that it's really overwhelming and easy to overlook them if you watch it instead of emerging into it. Many things which have be seen as kitsch by the average critic, actually make a huge point, and, in addition, there are a lot of subtleties. The following example is not really what i mean by the scope of the film, but in one scene, in which someone refers to the pickpocket, Cameron Diaz, as Mrs. Amsterdam, Amsterdam being the name of Leo Dicaprio's character, he is either making a joke about their relationship or they have really been married, although no other mention or scene of a marriage has taken place. This is exactly what Coppola did in ""The Godfather"" films. Characters would mention things or a baby would be seen, and this one thing would say or show something that happened that otherwise was not spoken or heard of... a marriage, the birth of a child, a killing, etc., which also shows the time that has passed and some minor detail that relates to the main story itself. In the context of the film as a whole it does not mean a lot to the main story, but it shows that something has happened which we haven't been shown, some time has passed, and that, in GONY Leo and Cameron are now a valid, and trusting, couple. In probably his best role yet, Daniel Day-Lewis plays a man nicknamed ""the Butcher,"" who leads the gang that opposed Leo's father's. In the style of the great method actors, Brando and Bobby DeNiro, he kept his New York accent on and off the set. Now, one critic stated that his character is, in a sense, over the top, P.T. Barnum-ish (P.T. Barnum happens to be a character in the film, as well, and is named-dropped on several occasions for good reason), that he might as well have been computer generated... but that's a major part of his character... and the story and the time. He is a caricature of America, portraying our morbid curiousity, amongst several other things. This film is America... past, present, future... vigilantes... racism... power-hungry... mass murderers and murder in general (which the media and entertainment loves to show, including this film, but at least it had an extremely valid reason)... bloodshed of war between our own people and between ""us"" and ""the foreigners""... organized crime... a corrupt government... corrupt politicians... assassination... minor religious differences and the huge problems they cause... men drafted to fight for ""their country"" that usually end up coming home in wooden boxes... bribery... class distinctions and differences... theft... the morbid curiousity and the attraction to the freakish... satirization and caricaturization of the government and... etc., etc., etc. The central plot is a revenge story, with a love story on the side, but what it's really about is all of the aforementioned problems and quirks that are American... that ARE America. I think a lot of people missed out on this, because it wasn't told outright to them. The time period ends with the draft riots, which was one of the bloodiest events, if not thee bloodiest, in American history. I believe this says a lot about the movie and America as a whole. The final shot makes all of this obvious. It shows the New York of the 1800s slowly build into the New York of today. I'll let that speak for itself. The way Scorsese moves the camera shows all of these things, with his trademark tracking shots, and, really, any of his shots. He takes everything from ""Mean Streets,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""Kundun,"" everything great about his films and pieces them all together in this one. So much is going on around the characters, around the film itself, and Scorses captures all of it. America might as well be ""all this stuff"" that DeNiro's Travis Bickle sweeps his hand over in ""Taxi Driver."" One last comment: The set is one of the greatest ever constructed. The more money these producers give Scorsese, when they do, the better the film he makes. He even paid for the film from some of his own salary he received for directing it. Apparently, George Lucas (read the Trivia) saw the set and told Scorsese they have computers that can do that now. And that... THAT is the difference between a director and an auteur."

","Amazing that many California reviewers are ignorant of film history...then again maybe not since the industry started on the East Coast.  New York and New Jersey were centers of US film production prior to Hollywood.  In fact, D.W. Griffith, as a director for Biograph, worked with cameraman Billy Bitzer in about 500 Biograph films shot mostly in Fort Lee, New Jersey, and on location in New York City from roughly 1908-1913.  Scorsese's work in Gangs of New York serves as a link to the work of Griffith  (see ""The Musketeers of Pig Alley"" shot on location on New York's Lower East Side circa 1912).  Gangs is a seminal work of an American Master....Martin Scorsese."

"Brogan","10","0","0","21 December 2002"," Best film of 2002!
","I've been admiring Martin Scorsese's films for the last twelve years, ever since I first watched GOODFELLAS.  I've saw his new release films on the big screen since then, and loved them (CASINO, CAPE FEAR, AGE OF INNOCENCE, KUNDUN, & BRINGING OUT THE DEAD).  I would even see re-releases or special screenings of his classics brought back on the big screen (GOODFELLAS, TAXI DRIVER, LAST WALTZ).  In fact it was eariler this year that I watched THE LAST WALTZ for the first time on the big screen, and I noticed the camera shots and techniques that Scorsese used in story films, were also used in a concert film!  Scorsese tried nine years ago to tell accurate peorid piece film of a New York that has been long past with AGE OF INNOCENCE.  He made a great love story with effective performances, yet the pacing was very slow, coming from a man who speaks 175 words a minute. GANGS OF NEW YORK is the latest film that Scorsese has been put on the ""work in progress"" list for the last twenty-five years, Scorsese filmed it, it had production nightmares and problems, getting pushed backed several times including the incident of September 11th 2001.  Now after all the wait, negative production press reports, and hype, is GANGS OF NEW YORK a TITANIC, or a HEAVEN'S GATE?  I'm a very pleased to say that from my anticipation and wait, that GANGS is a extradonary film that has the feeling of a successful epic like TITANIC, and not a laughable failure like HEAVEN'S GATE. GANGS OF NEW YORK has a very simple plot, but so do a lot of other great movies.  In 1846, the five points of New York City is  being fought by two gangs who wish to control the area, the Dead Rabbits immigrants lead by Priest Vallon (Liam Nesson) and the native Nativists lead by William Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis) is was called Bill the Butcher.  After the Nativists defeated the Dead Rabbits, killing Priest Vallon, the priest's son Amsterdam, was taken to a orphanage for sixteen years until he was old enough to take care of himself.  Now, the adult Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Capprio) is vowing for the revenge of the death of his father, by killing the man who took his father's life, Bill the Buthcher.  Bill takes a liking of Amsterdam by training him the ways of life around the five points.  The way the gangs steal, the way to kill a man, the corperation of the courrption of politics, and even the most tender and best parts of carving up a pig.  Amsterdam learn all of Bill's traits, but also falls in love with one of Bill's women, Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz).  Jenny makes her living by being a prostitue but earns more of a living by becomming a highly successful pickpocket.  Amsterdam faces the conflict of either to continue to vow the vengence of his father's death, or to live the lifestyle which is better than anything he has ever lived before, with the most ruthless man known. Some people are expecting GANGS OF NEW YORK to be the epic film that answers everything.  Well, it's not a David Lean epic, a Stanely Kubrick epic, or even a Steven Spielberg epic, it's a Martin Scorsese epic.  While I was watching GANGS OF NEW YORK, I couldn't get out of my mind that this is the same film directed by the man who did TAXI DRIVER and ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, and it would have been only those other credits on Scorsese's career, had Scorsese directed GANGS when he wanted to.  But there have been several other films since, RAGING BULL, LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, GOODFELLAS, CASINO, AFTER HOURS. etc.  And this film is the same visionary mind behind those other films. There are scenes where the Scorsese trademark is shown, the obvious scene is when Scorsese has a excellent track shot that shows immigrants coming off of the boat onto the New York pier, only the men to be taken from the U.S. government by drafting them in Union army with a war that they have no idea where or why they are fighting.  A story like that is worthy of a good film alone.  And Scorsese does his ""Hitchcock cameo"" in the film by appearing as the head of a weatlhy family household. But there are other scenes in GANGS that I was amazed to be watching on the screen.  There were scenes of astonishing beauty with the creation of the sets of the dilapidated New York and the descriptive lifestyles of a New York resident of the 1860's.  The long shot of the fighting match on a river raft showing steamships and sail ships towering over the people and buildings.  The detailed costumes of the immigrants, the natives, and the high class ellite. Then there is the acting.  DiCapprio does a decent job as Amsterdam, but he wasn't' as enjoyable to watch in this film, as he was in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (he was much better in that film).  Cameron Diaz was good as Jenny, showing that she is a actress trying to break out of the ""pretty face"" roles of CHARLIE'S ANGELS and SWEETEST THING and taking on complicated roles like GANGS and VANILLA SKY.  I also enjoyed the supporting roles of Jim Broadbent as the corrupt politician who associates with the gangs, Henry Thomas as another street gang member who wishes to win the heart of the popular Jenny, John C. Reilly as a corrupt and twisted officer who feels that he has a upper hand of the five points only by being a police officer, Liam Nesson as the heroic and influenal priest, and Brendan Gleason as the man who knows more about the priest's past than Amsterdam knows. But who does the film belong to, who stands out of the entire cast? Daniel Day Lewis gives his best performance of his career in this film, and yes, I'm including his role in MY LEFT FOOT.  I haven't seen a villian so twisted, human, and likeable since Henry Fonda's character of Frank in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.  Lewis' role of Bill the Butcher isn't as showy as Hannibal Lecture, or over the top like the overrated Denzel Washington role of TRAINING DAY.  If Denzel won a Oscar last year for TRAINING DAY, then Daniel Day Lewis should win a Oscar for this role.  There have been several good performances this year, Tom Hanks in ROAD TO PERDITION, Adam Sandler in PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, George Clooney in SOLARIS, and Hugh Grant in ABOUT A BOY. But I couldn't believe that all of those performances would be overshadowed by the performance given by Daniel Day Lewis.  Lewis' performance as the one eyed butcher shows the audience the early stages of the mafia boss.  Where we are use to the modern mobster boss image of Robert DeNiro in UNTOUCHABLES, Marlon Brando in GODFATHER, and James Gandolfini in SOPRANOS, Lewis is along the same class of actors and images of a powerful crime boss. Lewis gives the role of Bill the Butcher more human traits and personality than any villian I have ever seen.  Having a fondness of cutting meat, upholding his part of controlling the laws, and ruling his area of the five corners with his iron fist.  People need to realize that the character of Bill the Butcher is the early stages of the now known mafia boss, a man who has a lot of power, and supports his people by giving the needy meat or money.  Bill's mafia like presence and attitude in shown early when he criticizes Amsterdam by not ""presenting"" Bill with any valuables or gifts. To me, I say a film characters work if the villian is just as good or more effictive than the hero.  The role of Bill is so powerful and effective that it is among the best villians in the history of cinema.  Would I like to see Lewis win a Oscar?  YEAH!  You bet!  But I think the character of Bill will be better rewarded as being a memorable character like Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecture, and Forrest Gump (yet those are Oscar winning roles also). From looking at the images, performances, and story of GANGS OF NEW YORK, I can easily say that it is my favorite film of 2002.  I've been waiting for this film for the last two years, and I am so relieved to say that it was worth the wait.  I watched the film with seven other people who's taste in films are all different than my own.  After the lights went up, all of us were applauding and cheering saying how that was one darn well made film!  One person commented a flaw that bothered her, the editing. She said that it made the film too ""choppy"" making things not fully explained. Yet I told her that the film was originaly over three hours and for this being close to three hours, the film seemed like a hour long.<br/><br/>If the Academy is awarding directors who haven't gotten a Oscar yet, like what a lot of people said about Ron Howard last year (although I thought he deserved it), then why not give Scorsese his Oscar.  Scorsese should have gotten his oscar twelve years ago when he did GOODFELLAS, but it went to Kevin Costner instead with the overrated DANCES WITH WOLVES.  The buzz has been going around for the last several months that Scorsese might get his long awaited Oscar with this film.  And I say that I would rather see Scorsese get his Oscar with a amazing film like GANGS OF NEW YORK, than good but not great films like AGE OF INNOCNECE or KUNDUN.  How does GANGS on my personal view rank on Scorsese's career?  For me, it's not as good as GOODFELLAS or CASINO, but I thought it was better than RAGING BULL and TAXI DRIVER.  I know that's a very big bold statement to make, but I stand by that, and ask me again in a year or ten years, and I'll still stand by it. Scorsese put a lot of work and effort into this film, it shows, and he succeeded.  Academy Members:  Give Mr. Scorsese his Oscar!  This is the best film of the year!  ***** (out of five)"
"Chris Knipp","Null","0","0","21 December 2002"," Too much ungliness. And by the way, what's the point?
","Let's begin with the casting. It's not clear to me why some people seem to like Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in `Gangs of New York' so very much. (`He IS the film,' an enthusiastic viewer said to his companion as I walked out.) It's a caricature, if a sly one, and the New York accent is the same artificial drawl he did somewhere else.  The long speech he does draped in a flag brings yawns.  Day-Lewis has a reputation as a risk taker; but is Bill the Butcher a risk -- or merely a burden dutifully shouldered? Perhaps what he needs on his résumé are a few more roles as contemporary Englishmen. The ultimate stretch for some actors is to play who they actually are.<br/><br/>
Bill the Butcher's youthful Irish enemy, Amsterdam Vallon, is permanently angry, hostile, waiting for revenge.  This isn't an ideal role for Leonardo Di Caprio, a young man full of joie de vivre who's excelled as wild and exuberant characters.  How can the explosive retarded boy of `Gilbert Grape,' the strutting bean pole of `Total Eclipse,' the romantic and defiant teenager of `Romeo' and `Titanic,' or the spoiled adventurer of `The Beach' seem right as this beefy young gangster, who, however arresting at times, is always dour and doomed?  Leo as a gangster might have worked.  Leo could be a charming outlaw - and he is soon to be one in Spielberg's `Catch Me If You Can.'  But it doesn't work here.  And the superfluous voiceover he speaks makes things worse.  Di Caprio's unimpressive voice has always been his Achilles heel.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz, on the other hand, does do very well indeed in what remains a conventional movie role:  Jenny Everdeane, the colorful wench full of feistiness but ultimately pushed aside when the heroes duke it out to the death.  It's not bad casting; it's bad writing.<br/><br/>Beyond these three who stand in the foreground, most of the other characters fade quickly from memory.  The colorful personalities suggested by the gangs' wild names aren't brought to individualized life.  And since character is all this movie has, that's fatal.<br/><br/>Scorsese seems to have no sense of structure in `Gangs of New York.'  The movie goes nowhere.  `The world turns,' Leo says, in the voiceover's most ironic line, `and sometimes we don't even notice it.' The world of `Gangs' turns, all right, and, going nowhere we'd be likely to notice, comes back to another violent cowboy movie showdown like the opening one - which was actually more arresting, if only because we were fresher then.  In the end, what has it all been for?  The revenge is blunted by the affection Bill and Amsterdam develop for each other.  Di Caprio's performance hasn't the depth to convey the complex conflicts he would feel in a final confrontation under these circumstances. There's no catharsis, and no understanding.<br/><br/>
Somewhere the point of it all was lost.  Cinecittà, where `Gangs of New York' was shot, is pretty far from old New York. Working in an Italian film studio seems to have led Scorsese away from any New York into the world of spaghetti westerns. The director loves the city he grew up in. Can he convey that affection, or recreate his city's origins, by dramatizing a colorful but somewhat questionably accurate book about nineteenth century gangs? Is an Italian American a suitable champion of the Irish immigrants?<br/><br/>
Though the surface details of dress and accoutrements may seem realistic (we know how well they were done in `Age of Innocence' for another much more urbane old New York), what good is superficial accuracy when the whole series of collective actions seems pointless, focused only on racism and the rejection of it -- and social and political events, and underlying economic motives, have been disregarded altogether or distorted beyond accuracy or point?  This movie bit off more than it could chew, and the result is a big mess.<br/><br/>But what is most troubling about `Gangs' is its relentless gore.  When has one seen so much blood pouring down bodies and flowing in the streets, so many limbs lopped off, guts cut out, knives thrown; so much menace of maiming and dismemberment and torture?  The violence is mind boggling and sickening.  Ving Rhames' famous threat in `Pulp Fiction,' `I'm gonna get medieval on your ass,' seems positively effete by comparison.  This is a movie to be slogged through.  It's deadening and disheartening.<br/><br/>There is one sequence - from another, pleasanter, better film - when Di Caprio finds he's been pick pocketed by Cameron Diaz and follows her on a streetcar and thence to a rich house where she enters costumed as a maid, steals things, comes out, and is confronted by him, threatening, close enough to kiss.  This one moment is worth the rest.<br/><br/>`Gangs of New York' is numbing, but not unwatchable.  Martin Scorsese couldn't produce a film that wasn't worth getting through.  But this is a project that went on too long, and went wrong, and it shows."

The camerawork is excellent, the sets, costumes, lighting, and overall tone is unremittingly dark, gritty, and sometimes downright bizarre.<br/><br/>The film's denouement dodges the expected (and would-be cliched) ending (I'll not give spoiling specifics though).  This made the film.  The odd ending was oddly affecting, and ultimately powerful.  Gangs of New York is worth seeing.  8/10"

","Let me start out saying that I am a true Scorsese fan. I have seen all of his films and enjoyed almost all of them, New York, New York and Boxcar Bertha aside. I have the deepest respect for the man, his movies, and his morals. Gangs of New York was a fully realized dream for Scorsese. And I enjoyed it more than any movie in years. However, it wasn't the flawless diamond many have made it out to be. There were a few major problems, namely:<br/><br/>1) DiCaprio. I know that he was one of the main factors in allowing Scorsese the gain the funding and backing to create this film, and this would've been GREAT, if only he had stayed out of the movie itself. DiCaprio, although it looks like his nose has been twisted out of shape with a pair of pliers and his beard looks like the groin of a 14 year old boy, is supposedly some sort of sex symbol. His acting is atrocious. His accent fluctuates from a deep Irish dialect to some sort of Hugh Grant imitation. And he has deeply profound lines such as ""The earth turns, but we don't feel it move"". His love scenes are horrible. He is a wimp. He looks like a wimp. No matter how tough he tries to be, he will always be a wimp. I realize that some of these problems are due in part to the script, which I will address next.<br/><br/>2) The Script. Many of DiCaprio's lines were ridiculous. Many seemed out of place. I think a lot of this is due to Weinstein's insistence that the movie be cut by an hour, and a bad thing got worse when Scorsese, for whatever reason, refused to add them back in for the DVD. When you write lines for an actor that is not very proficient in his field (with the exception of Gilbert Grape), you have to make sure that those lines are very solid and easy to perform.  Unfortunately for those of us who waited so long for this movie, Dicaprio's weren't. A lot of the characters, especially Jenny Everdeane, seemed to have almost no real relevance to the movie at all. It seemed like they threw it in at the last minute just to attract moviegoers, and I suspect it was the doing of Weinstein. This is unfortunate, because without such distractions, I think this movie would've had fared much better. Removing those unnecessary subplots would've freed up enough time for all that Scorsese was required to cut out. How sad. The voice-over narration for Casino and Goodfellas was exemplary to the highest degree. Not so in Gangs. The voice-over narration that DiCaprio provided was nothing short of disgraceful.<br/><br/>3) The Music. I know a lot of you disagree on this point, but I'm gonna say it anyway. The music in some areas of this movie was breathtaking, other times it sounded like a bunch of Confederate soldiers whistling Dixie along with a harmonica. Not even close to comparing to many of Scorsese's previous soundtracks. A little rough around the edges.<br/><br/>4) The Cinematography. I must admit, the scenes at the beginning of the movie (when Dad dies) had me out of my seat cheering along with the rest of the theater. The cinematography wasn't bad. But it wasn't the Scorsese-Ballhaus imagery that we're used to. I applaud them for trying out a few new techniques, but all these new shots utterly failed. Since when has a Scorsese movie relied on newspaper headlines or flashbacks? There were a few scenes that really got to me, such as the water reverberating across the Bible that DiCaprio threw into the river after leaving prison. I would have really enjoyed the scenes where the rioters broke into and looted the houses of the rich, had the horrible tap-tapping of a telegraph machine been removed along with the guy that was pitifully screaming out the meaning of these telegraph wires. Those things aside, the cinematography was great.<br/><br/>All in all, Gangs was extraordinary. This was a movie I wanted so much to love with all my heart, but no matter how hard I tried I still only felt little more than lukewarm about it. My second viewing was better, but the flaws I had noticed before seemed to bother doubly. But, then again, so did the movie's great moments. Such as every scene that Daniel Day-Lewis is in. No matter how this movie fares, Day-Lewis better win the Oscar for Best Actor or I'll eat my hat. Better yet, I'll run over to the Academy and make them eat their's. I can do nothing but laud his performance. His accent was perfect, his demeanor was sharp. All of his lines were carried out with swift enthusiasm and cunning wit. His acting job was the best I have seen in years, maybe even the last ten or fifteen. He saved the movie and made it real. In my opinion, if he had not been cast, this movie would've tanked, both with critics and the public. Certainly with me. No matter what faults and flaws can be found, this movie will still be breathtaking. It is too epic to suffer belittlement and too proud to suffer defeat."

I found the film to be enthralling and explosive. I was not expecting an action film when I stepped into the theater. Instead what I got was a war movie. There is a great amount of bloody violence that many people will find too difficult to stomach. I was able to handle it. The violence may be the one thing that might discourage the Academy from giving this film a high number of nominations. Other than that, Martin Scorsese has given a great motion picture too be treasured throughout the years. GANGS OF NEW YORK gets 5/5."
"ilovedolby","9","0","0","22 December 2002"," Remarkable motion picture; one of the year's best!
","It had been one hell of a week to go to the movies. First, came the release of The Two Towers, the much-anticipated Lord Of The Rings sequel. Now we have Martin Scorsese's new film, Gangs Of New York. It stars Leonardo Dicaprio (Titanic), Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels), and Daniel Day-Lewis (The Last Of The Mohicans). This film has had a lot of buzz generated about it lately. Some from the fact that is being released against another Dicaprio film in another week, Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can. But also due to the fact that Gangs looks to be one of the year's finest motion pictures. And currently, probably the best film playing next to The Two Towers. Unfortunately, none of our local cinemas have received a print of it. In fact, I saw in Burlington yesterday. However, we may be lucky enough within the upcoming weeks to see it one of our local marquees. Until then, I guess you'll just have to wait unless you are willing to see it Montreal, or Burlington. 	Taking place in New York City during the mid-1800s amidst the upcoming Civil War, it tells the story of a young Irish-man named Amsterdam Vallon who witnessed his father's death as a boy in a rough area of New York called The Five Points. His father, played by Liam Neeson, is an Irish Priest and leads the other Irish against the a rival gang in the New York at the time headed by Daniel Day-Lewis's character, Bill the Butcher. After witnessing his father's demise at the hand of Bill the Butcher, Amsterdam is sent to an orphanage, and when he gets old enough he sets out on his own with the intention of getting revenge for his father's death. Amsterdam allies himself with Bill the Butcher, and learns how to handle the tough streets of the Five Points. Along the way, he meets a beautiful woman played by Cameron Diaz, called Jenny Everdeane. Jenny is a pickpocket and is Amsterdam's love interest in the film. However, as time goes on and Amsterdam and Jenny become closer, a friend of Amsterdam's named Johnny Sirocco, played by Henry Thomas (E.T., All The Pretty Horses) and also in love with Jenny, finds out about the affair between Amsterdam and Jenny. Johnny, filled with jealousy sells Amsterdam out to Bull the Butcher, who did not realize that Amsterdam was the son of the Irish priest he killed so many years before. Now the battle lines are being drawn between the natives of New York and Irish, blacks, and other immigrants who make up the rival faction of Amsterdam, called the Dead Rabbits. 	The film is truly stunning. As stated before, it takes place against the Civil War and declaration of the draft by Lincoln. New York City was in chaos at the time with rioters and looters protesting the war. It actually led to Marshall Law being declared in the city. The film portrays these scenes with great precision and accuracy. Another great quality of the film is it's set design, which is immense and there is no digital affect here that isn't real. What you see, is what you get in this film, and we see quite a bit. The performances are superb from every member of the cast. I can't think of a single one to complain about. Also, the music used in the film is very good, as well. It contains some score composed by Academy Award winning composer, Howard Shore (Lord Of The Rings). U2 does a song, which doesn't appear in the film, but probably during the end credits and on the soundtrack called, `The Hands That Built America.' Not to mention the countless other pieces music that are used in the film; traditional folk songs from all walks of life  most notably Celtic music. Scorsese did a wonderful job directing this film, and is quite possibly one of the best, if not the best film of year. However, I'm cautious to say that Gangs Of New York is the best film of the year because there is still another film, at least on my list, that is note worthy to see: Catch Me If You Can, also starring Leonardo Dicaprio. ****"
"rosscinema","7","0","0","22 December 2002"," Bloody, Brawling Epic.
","I really do admire this film but I didn't love it. It's so impressive looking and Martin Scorsese filmed it in Italy at the legendary Cinecittia Studios and the ""Making Of"" will probably be more interesting than the film itself. Daniel Day Lewis as Bill saves the film for me, his performance really dominates the film and he should get an Oscar nomination for it. Leonardo DiCaprio is fine but I don't think he's very memorable. Cameron Diaz added nothing to the film and is cast just to be ""The Girl"". I think the main flaw in the film is that Scorsese throws to much into the script with draft rioting, race wars, crooked politicians, people revolting against the abolition of slavery, the war, the army brought in to fight the rioters, war between the classes. There is so much going on that the final half hour becomes chaotic and the main story between Dicaprio and Lewis almost becomes a side story and gets swamped. But I do recommend this film highly mainly for the incredible sets that were built and of course for the performance of Lewis. The film also reminds us of an ugly but important part of our history. Story is flawed but its still an impressive epic."
"randythetool","9","0","0","20 December 2002"," A harrowing picture of war and its consequences. A masterpiece.
","In the tradition of war movies, there are certain elements that remain constant - the love interest, the friend who turns to foe (sometimes the foe who turns to friend), and always vengeance for some past wrong.  Martin Scorsese's latest masterwork, ""Gangs of New York,"" contains all of these, but it's not a traditional war movie.  ""Apocalypse Now"" is one of the most effective war films ever made, but not because it's about war - it's about the effects of war, which, if handled correctly, are far more interesting than battle scenes.  ""Gangs"" has much in common with ""Apocalypse Now,"" and yet, the two are not comparable.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly standard fare for war films - Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) kills Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), the father of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Dicaprio) when he is a young child. Amsterdam is then sent away for sixteen years, at which time he returns to his old stomping grounds, the Five Points, and swears revenge for his father's death.  During the sixteen year absence of Amsterdam, Bill the Butcher has become somewhat of a Charles Foster Kane in the Five Points.  Every business in the district pays tribute to him, and he controls pretty much everything from politicians to the fire departments.  Through chance, Bill meets Amsterdam, and without knowing his true identity, takes him in as a sort of foster son.  There are twists and turns, revelations and regrets, but I will leave you to see these yourself, because watching this film unfold is one of the greatest delights I've had in the theater this year.<br/><br/>What we have here is a portrait of violence.  In the beginning of the film, we see Amsterdam look at his father and his gang, The Dead Rabbits, with a quiet awe.  Of course, he knows that his father kills people, but they fight for the right to live in the Five Points in relative peace.  We are given a glorified view of the war between the immigrants and the ""natives.""  Leonardo DiCaprio captures this perfectly, as the naive boy who is too hell-bent on revenge to see that his foe is not the monster he wishes he was.  Daniel Day-Lewis's Bill the Butcher reminds me of Paul Cicero from ""Goodfellas,"" in that he's a good man with bad business.  He holds Amsterdam's father in the highest regard, calling him ""the last good man [he] killed.""  Every year on the anniversary of the first battle, Bill holds a ceremony to celebrate and honor Vallon's death.  Amsterdam sees this as an insult to the memory of his father, where Bill sees it as an homage.  The two become as good of friends as is possible under these circumstances, until the inevitable conflict comes to the surface.<br/><br/>In ""Being John Malkovich,"" Cameron Diaz showed us that she could act. Here, she shows us that she can act quite well.  I had my misgivings about her being in the film, but I can see that she was the right choice for the part.  She looks like someone whose been through enough struggle and still remains beautiful, if not flawed.  There is a scene which looks like the setup for a sex scene between her and DiCaprio, but instead of sex, we have the two comparing scars beneath the surface.  She doesn't know about Amsterdam's vendetta against Bill the Butcher, but she wants to take him with her to San Francisco, where they ""pull gold out of the river with their bare hands.""  She has been poor all her life, and, under the hand of Bill, she has survived.  Now that Amsterdam has been raised as Bill's protoge, she wants to take him away from the nonsensical fighting that is everyday life.<br/><br/>In 1863, when the Conscription Act was passed, every man had to register for the draft, or pay three hundred dollars to save his life.  There is a scene of magnificent beauty where Irish immigrants come off the boat into America, enlist in the Army, get into uniform, are shipped right back onto a boat, which is returning with an endless sea of coffins filled with those who came over last week.  Riots ensue, thousands upon thousands are killed, and Scorsese makes an interesting point.  The men of the Five Points are willing to fight for their country, but on their own terms.  They fight an enemy with a face, and for their own reasons, not because a commanding officer tells them to.<br/><br/>What Scorsese has done here will likely be hailed as one of the great war movies, and rightly so.  He has no illusions about war, and doesn't feed us with the glory of fighting for what you believe in. The only thing that war creates is dead bodies. The politicians in the picture complain of all the votes they're losing. Soldiers are recycled into coffins, rioters into a neverending line of candle light, and in the end, Scorsese says, ""it'll be like we were never here.""  Here is one of the best pictures of the year.<br/><br/>Four stars, out of four."
"janyeap","Null","0","0","21 December 2002"," It's a mesmerizing New York epic told in the best of filmmaking skills...
","This film presents a combination of what makes a great film truly tick! Solid depth, non-confusing battle' scenes, wonderful cast of characters, great cinematography, and more important, a fabulous narration style that makes sense! And the flow of events is of a pacing that is commendable for supporting the character development and for telling the story.<br/><br/>
There are loads of violent takes... but hey, isn't this film supposed to reveal the events of that era's New York City streets?  Aren't they supposed to be the pivotal points of the story?  Surely, Scorsese does not mean to bombard the viewers with explosively visual imagination purely to stifle or shock one's nerves. The violence is actually splattered in Herbert Asbury's book of the same title! Amazing feat, I'm still awed by how Scorsese could condense such a thick book into a film and still maintains a true sense of the New York City of the 19th Century that was infested with so many corrupted gangs and tribes. What one sees is a chaotic urban city, not crowded by vehicles or building structures, but by human beings, fighting for power and running amok!  This movie succeeds as a history lesson about New York City in its infancy stage.  The flavor of its multi-cultures is well portrayed.  The gist of Asbury's book is superbly treated. The development of the characters is well maintained. The themes of loyalty and vengeance flush out strongly in this film. Even the sub-plots are admirably introduced, almost as if they are the necessary spices added to enrich the main plot. Combined, they offer an in-depth understanding of the moods, the morals and the politics of New York in those days.     <br/><br/>
A great cast of actors to captivate the audience!  I actually didn't recognize Liam Neeson in his Father Vellon role. Daniel Day Lewis gives an incredible `butcher' performance... moving from a younger looking Billy, the leader of the Native Americans, to his `Butcher' - 16 years down the road. I thought the young lad who plays the little boy, Amsterdam, is a great choice. Try comparing his facial expressions with Leonardo DiCaprio's adult Amsterdam, and you'll know what I mean. I am not big on Dicaprio, but I really thought he does very well in presenting his character. Cameron Diaz is truly mesmerizing; she commands the viewers' attention, even if her role plunges into the story's sub-plots.  There's great chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's. With Jim Broadbent's portrayal as the corrupt Mayor Tweed here, plus his corrupt Wackford Squeers in Nicholas Nickleby, I'd say he's incredibly apt to take on any villain' roles of the earlier centuries.  The dialogue works well with every character, leading the audience into the insights of historical events. The use of flashbacks is brilliantly done  it serves its phenomenal purpose of exposing the characters' feelings during those moments as well as spurring up recall-reflexes to account for the characters' past positions. <br/><br/>
The cinematic effects are astounding, never leaving the viewers with the feel of pretentious aestheticism. Instead, it allows the viewers to relive history in a manner that appears genuine. Take any of the riots' or fight' scenes, for instance, I couldn't bring myself to denounce the existence of those events.  They look too real on screen to lack historical credibility. Watching those New York residents wielding their kitchen knives did leave me cold with fear. That's how awesomely realistic this movie is for me.  <br/><br/>
John Carpenter's scores are so, so cool too! They actually cause my heart to beat dramatically in sync with them.  This film is absolutely powerful and spectacular, the story folding beautifully with the characters. <br/><br/>
My favorite film for the year!"

","There is a very good reason why ""Gangs of New York"" was delayed for a whole year that has nothing to do with its bloated budget and extended shooting schedule. There was a little event called 9/11. With this epic masterpiece that is as brilliant in its flaws as it is in its triumphs (which, by the way, far outnumber the flaws), Scorsese ultimately paints a picture of America that some, in lieu of 9/11, might find very unpatriotic. In the end (POTENTIAL SPOILERS), he seems to be saying that the biggest ""gang"" of them all, is/was the American government. Scorsese takes a look at time in history that is largely unknown to people when New York City was ruled by gangs (usually natives vs. immigrants) and corrupt politicians who could care less about the Civil War or Lincoln or slavery (which is mostly what is taught now in history class about this era). The central historical event in the beginning is the brutal Five Points Gang War of 1846. This is mirrored at the climatic end by the Draft Riots near the end of the Civil War. The US government sends in the military to stop the riots and they leave countless numbers dead and the city in ruin. It is here, where the ways of the Old World (honorable territorial fights between gangs) are supplanted by the ways of a New Era (big government crashing down on you). <br/><br/>At any rate, despite its pageantry and epic proportions and very melodramatic revenge plot (which many will see as a plus, and on all counts is wondrous and beautifully executed), this is still at its heart a Scorsese picture. This means a whole lot of the ultra violence, snazzy camera work (lots of dolly shots), interesting uses of music to punctuate the drama (I really loved the period minstrel music while the schizophrenic music score was a bit distracting), degradation of women (in service of the plot and the usually despicable male characters, by no means indicative of Scorsese's feelings towards women IMHO, though many might debate this point), and lots and lots of blood. Scorsese fans should rejoice at this. Any fan of cinema should want to see it for the grand spectacle of it all (the all non-CGI sets built in Rome are fantastic in that old fashioned classic Hollywood way, and the costumes are magnificent in a post-modern Dickensian kind of way...a lot of imagination and thought went into every aspect of this film), and of course, Daniel Day Lewis's portrayal of Bill the Butcher is worth the price of admission alone. However, if you are not a student of cinema or fan of Scorsese, you may find this all a bit overblown, over the top, and painfully long. Love it or loathe it, this will be a film discussed and debated for all time."

","Gangs of New York takes place in 19th Century New York (the early 1850s to be exact) and tells us the story set around the masses of Irish immigrants coming to New York, at the same time the civil war was raging, and an insight into early gang influences in New York.<br/><br/>The English `natives' who were descended from early English settlers (when escaping British rule) are the dominating gang in New York's `Five Points' neighbourhood.  The opening scene displays a showdown gang-battle between some of the earliest Irish immigrants and their allegiances, against the `Natives' who object to outsiders coming in to their territory'.<br/><br/>Sixteen years later, the young boy who had escaped the war is now a man.  It was his father that led the Irish `Dead Rabbits' gang, but was brutally killed in that brutal and bloody opening battle.<br/><br/>His return is subtle, and he unintentionally works his way into the gang, befriending the man who killed his father sixteen years earlier. <br/><br/>
However, there is much more to this film that a possible vengeance plot. There is the civil war aspect, and the political hand plays a very persuasive role.  Immigrants are constantly arriving by ship, and there is a draw to their attention.  The big picture' story here is one that you do not want to ignore.<br/><br/>Even though the elements of gang mythos are present (the power-by-fear, the sharing of profits, the respect, and even the political involvement) do not fool yourself.  This is NOT your ordinary gang-film. <br/><br/>Gangs of New York is so much more and with good reason.  This film has been on Scorsese's mind for a little over 20 years.  In fact, it was supposed to be his next production after Taxi Driver was released in 1977.  Apparently it got pushed back for one reason or another as well, the production release was delayed due to the September 11th attacks, and the release was delayed due to the mass of summer blockbusters.  But its delay was worth the wait.  The production of this film is astonishing.  There really is no reason to doubt that you are in 19th Century New York City, no reason to believe that the characters are real.  Their behaviour for the time period and location they are in is absolutely believable.<br/><br/>DiCaprio plays his most commanding role, and he does it fairly well.  He can't do an Irish accent, but that's nothing to be concerned about.  However the show is stolen by Daniel Day-Lewis.  Day-Lewis gives his character, Bill Cutting, a very ferocious, cynical, and confident demeanor.  That's not to say the other characters are not equally colorful, because they are.  But it is his delivery of this character that makes him shine. I would be disappointed if he is not nominated for a supporting actor Oscar.<br/><br/>Another interesting point of mention (without spoiling) is the attitude between different groups that are shown in the film and how they compare with those that exist today  ranging from law enforcement, fire fighters, politics, and even crime involvement.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York may be the best movie out this year.  It's an epic piece, set in a period' time frame, in a setting we all are familiar with.  We can relate to the characters, and we can learn a few things along the way.<br/><br/>Although the film is excellent and well done, I found some parts of it a bit weak.  It's 8-star rating here BARELY squeaked by. But regardless, you should still not miss this one."

"lawprof","6","0","0","20 December 2002"," ""Gangs of New York"": How Accurate is its History?
","Beginning in the 1920s and for about a decade and a half Herbert Asbury wrote a series of historical travelogues about the sin quarters of a few American cities.  Examined were New Orleans's Latin Quarter and the Barbary Coast of California, San Francisco being its undisputed headquarters.  His most popular book was, however, ""Gangs of New York,"" which enjoyed a wide circulation and is easily found in second-hand bookstores today.  My copy is an original.  This book would never have enjoyed a contemporary republishing but for Martin Scorsese's adoption of its lurid story for his new, sprawling, partially engrossing but also flawed film of the same title.<br/><br/>Herbert Asbury was no scholar and in his introduction to ""Gangs of New York"" he wisely eschews any interest in or competence at sociological analysis - a reality any reader would recognize halfway into his saga.  Asbury was a popularizer of legend, myth and historical record recording with a bit of raciness that appealed to 1920s readers a past that he viewed as finished and buried.  His gangs were no longer a menace to urban folk (he wrote before Prohibition spawned the emergence of major organized crime, run competitively and homicidally by Italian, Irish and Jewish figures).<br/><br/>
Scorsese aims for accuracy.  In physically reconstructing the notorious ""Five Points"" area of Manhattan he did a good job (albeit in Italy!).  But mirroring on a set the famous Mission Church, later the infamous combined hot bed residence and brothel as well as criminal base of operations, isn't the same as doing what language can do: make alive the smells and cries that emanate from as close to hell as humans in their degradation can journey.<br/><br/>The film starts in 1846 with a violent confrontation between Irish Catholic emigrants and so called ""native"" Americans, what we might consider to be low(er) class WASPS.  Very low class.  A blind xenophobia and religious-based hatred fuels the bloody combat and it's an accurate reflection of a New York still gripped by the violence of the aptly named ""Know Nothings"" (actually their response to questions about their activities, this being before the heydey of the Fifth Amendment). Not mentioned in the film is the 1849 Astor Place riot, a protest by ""Know Nothings"" to the appearance of a famous English actor which ended in a number of these characters being swept away by militia fire.<br/><br/>Scorsese continues this explanation for inter-group homicide and rioting through the July 1863 Draft Riots, probably the most deadly urban riots in American history (the jury is still out and always will be as to the death toll especially amongst blacks).  This may work as cinema but it's not accurate.  Gut dislike of the Irish (and later the Italians and the Jews) was certainly real in 1863 but that wasn't what the riots were about.  The film does show violence against blacks including lynchings but the underlying hatred that drove thousands into the streets in mad rioting was fueled by economics.<br/><br/>By 1863 Irish AND Italian working class men feared that blacks would take away what often was a precarious livelihood at best.  The enactment of conscription by the Federal government (coming after the Confederacy had established the precedent) did not simply arouse rage because of a fear of combat.  The Draft was viewed by most white working class people, regardless of ethnic association, in two ways: it supported a war to liberate economically competitive blacks (which the film briefly shows through signs) and it bolstered the argument that the conflict was ""A Rich Man's War and a Poor Man's Fight.""  The film recognizes this with mention of the $300 substitute fee by which one hit with a draft notice could evade service. But the continued emphasis on religious basis as a cause of the rioting is exaggerated.<br/><br/>The depiction of the relatively young and politically perspicacious William Marcy (""Boss"") Tweed is amusingly on target and many in the Manhattan audience laughed when he mentions, offhand, his desire to build a great courthouse in the city (the Boss Tweed Courthouse led to his imprisonment where he died because of the monumental graft with which it is forever associated.  The building, beautifully restored, is again a source of political controversy).<br/><br/>Costumes and language largely reflect what we know of the times.  Scorsese engaged Luc Sante, author and historian, and probably one of the finest chroniclers of New York's criminal past, as adviser and his efforts show.<br/><br/>This film has attracted much media attention and articles on the history of New York's gangs have appeared in a number of publications including Time Out New York, New York Magazine and the New York Times.  On TV several good documentaries have been screened, for example on The History Channel. People wanting a serious and very well-written account of what Five Points was really like should read the book ""Five Points"" by Lyle Ambinder - it's close to definitive.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>As to the film:<br/><br/>It's good, not great. Twenty or thirty minutes could have been edited out and should have been. There are no opening screen credits and the first end credit is ""Directed by Martin Scorsese.""  That isn't there for nothing: this is as much a director's all-consuming project as was James Cameron's ""Titanic.""  Leonardo De Caprio is expectedly good as the young man seeking to avenge the death of his father at the hands of the leader of the ""Natives,"" played by an astonishing Daniel Day-Lewis.  His acting alone justifies seeing the film.  Cameron Diaz is predicatably okay, not more, playing that most endearingly familiar screen role, ""The Good-hearted Hooker Next Door.""<br/><br/>Overall, 6/10."

","Well, it's finally here. We see New York in the spring of its urban development, portrayed almost as if it were being compared to warlord Afghanistan. Countless gangs control the city at a time when the Irish were coming over in waves in the post-famine years, competing for respect and a way to live with those who would like to send them back. We also are working in the context of the Civil War and the first draft, which will incite a massive riot that will be shown in all its detail and horror in Scorsese's new film.<br/><br/>Scorsese has packed a wealth of information into a coherent whole. The detail is thick: we get a glimpse of the kinds of thieves that work in the city, the political intricacies of Boss Tweed and his supporters and rivals, as well as a religious context, strengthened as the theme of the central narrative. Although the film will be undoubtedly better understood by someone familiar with the history of the Draft Riots, it should be largely comprehensible to the attentive viewer good with keeping names straight.<br/><br/>
Among Scorsese's considerable accomplishments, the most impressive is his molding of characters that are largely three-dimensional, with Bill ""the Butcher"" standing out in this pack. Indeed, Daniel Day Lewis' performance will be talked about for years, not only for his ability to bring humor and tension to the role, but for his ability to draw the viewer into the development of his character. Beginning with a riveting oratorical prelude to the opening battle, we are set up for a movie centered around a madman. But is Bill a madman -- completely amoral only concerned with his own power? I'll leave that up to you, but it becomes less and less clear-cut. Or does it? We're always on edge.<br/><br/>DeCaprio is adequate if not memorable, something  that is largely understandable in light of his co-star's tour de force performance. The production is awesome. The thick atmosphere of the back streets of late 19th century London were portrayed with a rich detail in From Hell, but Gangs of New York brings even more authenticity to its setting. It's worth seeing only to watch the set.<br/><br/>To some, Gangs of New York might be remembered as a collection of extraordinary scenes -- none of which I will describe here -- than as one piece of filmmaking. It does have a certain operatic feel, which might have been inevitable when dealing with such a complicated set of circumstances, and a scene-stealer like Bill the Butcher. I say ""be remembered,"" but for this viewer, it worked as a whole just fine for 180 minutes."

But the real star here is Daniel Day-Lewis.  He is absolutely mesmerizing as Bill the Butcher.  His acting is superb and he steals the film.

"zloty","Null","0","0","13 December 2002"," Unmitigated dross
","Marty's gang prang<br/><br/>Well, it looks as though I'm going to be in a minority, but here goes, anyway. Personally I can barely believe this the same director who made such stunning, if not always likeable, American classics as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas and Raging Bull. Two hours 45 minutes of unmitigated dross is enough to make one call into question 30 years of cinematic history.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is loosely based on the gang warfare of the poverty-stricken Five Points and Bowery areas of New York during the mid-19th century, before and during the Civil War. Though very loosely based on real characters and events, Scorsese and screenwriter Jay Cocks have treated the base material with wild imagination, and the result is a hackneyed, cliché-ridden, cartoonish debacle with little convincing social or political context.<br/><br/>The design is sumptious and clearly very expensive - though rather 'Paint Your Wagon' - but there are few of Scorsese's trademark artistic flourishes. The only scene of real power, rather than overwhelming theatricality, is one in which Irish immigrants arriving on the quayside are given citizenship, drafted, put in uniforms and then loaded back onto ships - troopships - as the coffins of Civil War dead are simultaneously unloaded.<br/><br/>The film was made entirely in the CineCitta film studios in Rome, and the sets never look anything but what they are. Where one felt one could almost smell the opulence of the monied class in The Age of Innocence, the slums, dirt and crumbling buildings here are pure theme park.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the opening scene of an 1846 gangfight, which sets up the remaining, predictable two-and-a-half-hour plot, is laughable in its comic-book incompetence - almost as though a film-school first-termer, having been given a couple of hundred extras, had just told them to stand around on a soundstage and pretend to strangle each other, while he sprays tomato ketchup over the lot.<br/><br/>After the intensity of battle scenes created for films like The Thin Red Line, Saving Private Ryan and TV's Gettysburg and Band of Brothers, not to mention the work of action directors like Walter Hill, this is a throwback to Forties and Fifties-style filmmaking. But even the punch-up between John Wayne and Victor MacLaglen in The Quiet Man was more realistic.<br/><br/>Also laughably bad is the firefighters' gangbang, while there are several scenes that seem, for some reason, to have been speeded up, Keystone Cops style. The voice-over during the climactic (and unconvincing) draft riots is deeply embarrassing - one almost expects Forties-style spinning newspaper headlines. Beyond some snatches of Irish folk music, the soundtrack - U2? - is hideously out of place.<br/><br/>Leonardo Di Caprio is hopelessly miscast as a (supposedly) hardened, revenge-seeking son of Kerry, while Daniel Day Lewis, in curly moustache like the villain of a Victoria melodrama, is as menacing as a Woolworths Star Wars light sabre, without the batteries. Cameron Diaz barely registers, and though Jim Broadbent is OK as the corrupt Tammany Hall kingpin, William 'Boss' Tweed, it's hard to believe his character could wield any political clout.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese's Far And Away, with ketchup, but its sheer scale will make it an Oscar contender. It would be sadly ironic, though, if this was the film that finally won Marty the prize."

","Anyone expecting an historical chronology along the lines of The Godfather will be disappointed by this. Not that they should be - the sets are superb and the acting mostly first-class (yes, even Di Caprio). The film is set in a period of American history that (to my knowledge, at least) has rarely been used in film before. The whole tale of Five Points (sited where Wall Street is today!) is a fascinating depiction of a country in the making. It might be almost three hours long, but it certainly isn't boring. Perhaps Gangs of New York should be seen as a cinema counterpoint to Sleepy Hollow - that periwigged world between the Georgian colonists of the turn of the century and the frontier Wild West of the 1870s. Eat your heart out, LA gangs - America has never been so lawless... What lets the film down is the parallel plot of the affair between Di Caprio and Diaz which, for me, had too many overtones of Titanic without the water. Not that it's particularly bad, just that it's unneccesary in the context of such a big story. It's a pity, really - when you should be getting The Godfather, you feel you've somehow ended up with West Side Story... Di Caprio is the surprise - it's nice to see the man can act. Cameron Diaz is bewitching as the pickpocket who steals his heart. But it's Daniel Day Lewis who really takes the honours. Overwhelmingly charismatic as Bill the Butcher, this man has power on screen. If he doesn't get an Oscar, I'll eat my stovepipe hat... Gangs of New York is by no means without faults. Don't let any of this put you off, though - this is a powerful film that's worth seeing. And don't worry Mr Scorsese - if it bombs now, it will be seen as a classic in the future."

","This is a morally bankrupt, confused, fragmented, overly long, logically ridiculous mess of a bad movie. Please explain the greatness of this film, omitting the opinion that it looks good.<br/><br/>*Spoilers*<br/><br/>I have read comments here claiming this movie is realistic. Really though. Street fighting women donning steel claws a lÃ¡ the worst Mad Max inspired Hong Kong action movies. Phony accents. Over-played opera style bad guys. Beautiful 19th century hookers. Comic book sets. Does anyone here believe this is an accurate description of 19th century street life, gang violence and grittiness? It's so stylized it's ridiculous. I really can't understand the criticisms against the violence depicted, since Bugs Bunny seems more realistic and violent to me.<br/><br/>I have read comments here praising moral standpoints of this movie. What??? First off, how the f**k could anyone sympathize with the main character? Sure, his father is killed in a street fight, but his father is a murderous gang leader, presumably no more or less evil than over the top Bill Mr Butcher Dude. But Vallon prays to God and is called Priest, so it's OK for him to murder. Obviously, at this time the *Irish* gangs were good and wholesome, but the English, Polish, Italian gangs were evil and mindless... Yeah sure I really can buy the notion that the Irish gangs were benign, non-racist and egalitarian. They even had a token black, in a role that is *extremely* believable. The notion that in any gang warfare there is a good side and a bad side should appeal to all you half-wits out there.<br/><br/>And the poor mob are good guys too. OK, in a climactic scene they loot, murder, lynch blacks, steal, burn, destroy utilities and try to make the North lose the Civil War, but they really are morally upright. You feel *genuinely* sorry for the mob when the army puts the riot down. Obviously, the mob has a right to cause mayhem and destruction and massacre unhindered. After all, they were being drafted in part to fight against slavery. Why should they do that? They were *clearly* right to murder and steal instead.<br/><br/>So where does this movie stand? Some of the time it seems to side with the rioters plundering wealthy and killing blacks. As a pathetic attempt to deflect criticisms outlined above, it tries to portray the Irish gangs as the non-racist side. This ploy is so obvious and laughable that anyone being fooled by it should buy a brain. Irish police are known to loooove blacks since time immemorial.<br/><br/>A disgusting mercenary killer is shown as a great candidate for high-level law enforcement duties. This guy loots the dead Priest's pockets for blood money, and is still considered a hero by young Mr Pretty Boy Very Believable Tough Guy Street Fighter Caprio. When I elect a Sheriff I really want a 44 time killer as my appointee. Just as long as he's *Irish* I know he's good and kind anyways. As long as you murder non-Irish you are benevolent.<br/><br/>Pretty Boy hates Butcher Dude, and Butcher Dude hates Pretty Boy. Yet none of them puts out a contract on the other. Indeed, PB saves BD's life, and BD spares PB's life. BD only mutilates PB's face, and since this movie is so realistic his face is completely healed and reconstructed one scene later. Then, they ""Challenge According to the Ancient Rules of Battle"". I always do that too. I usually dress up in really ridiculous costumes and dance violent ballet in the streets with my Mad Max weaponry. That's really how it was done in days of old you know.<br/><br/>To sum up: Irish gangs are good, socially conscious, and non-racist, all other gangs are bad. Irish love blacks, but won't fight against slavery. Everyone wears ludicrous costumes like in Clockwork Orange. The person to sympathize with is the Pretty Boy, then you can't go wrong. Don't sweat the logic, just sit three hours through this bulls**t operatic mess and claim you've seen something significant.<br/><br/>And when does the horn-helmeted blond braided-hair fat broad jump in singing and swinging a battle-axe? In my imaginary cut the movie ends by Helga jumping in and dancing a little Irish jig, wielding a razor sharp neon-pink dildo she plunges in Pretty Boy's stomach, after which she delivers a stunning aria. I promise you, this scene would not have made the movie worse. Nuff said.<br/><br/>Peace"

","***SPOILERS HO!***<br/><br/>Before I start I'd like to say that it's not that I really didn't like the film, it's a fascinating bit of history that America really buries away really well. A lot of thought and money has gone into it and it does look good. It's kind of like Titanic; very simple story.  The trouble is its told in this case not very effectively and with pretensions to say all sorts of things of moment and import, but muddling all the many messages it's got into bleeeurrggh. It's kind of like a drunk trying to tell everyone they've left the gas on and the cat's not been put out.  This can be a good thing providing much debate about greatness or otherwise as well as just what the hell was going on.  In the case of this film though, that debate is one I'm going to pass on, it's not worth the effort.<br/><br/>It's a big wide sprawling mess.  I'm not sure what it was trying to say, but I think it managed vomit instead of really saying anything.  It most reminded me of sectarian inspired football (that's soccer) violence in the 1970's.  I've never seen some much fake red hair outside a Bay City Rollers reunion concert and it does not suit Cameron Diaz at all.  Nice scar though.<br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis was good.  He had a really fun character to play.  The main trouble I think, was that everything looked so fake and staged.  The accents were horrible, the hair was horrible, the costumes looked liked something out of a bad 70's BBC Dicken's adaptation.  Of course, this may all have been accurate to a degree of painstaking historical research I'm not aware of.  I know very little of life in New York during the American Civil War. It does give every actor with a bad accent in every movie yet to be made a brilliant excuse when challenged; 'Well my accent was way better than Daniel Day Lewis in Gangs of New York and no one complained about that.'<br/><br/>I think this movie has had too much subtle hype.  I was promised epic. Reviewers have said epic.  Epic is a word that follows Mr. Scorsese around like 'Italian-American', 'Catholicism' and 'family'.  This isn't epic.  It is overlong and yet seemed to have lots of bits missing.  The story is thin, the violence is inappropriately cartoonish, there seems to be a lot more style than substance and the message moves beyond ambiguous into the arena of confusion.<br/><br/>This is a product of Hollywood about a dubious part of 100% USA history in which the 'Natives' violently oppress immigrants at a time in the present when the USA is preparing for armed conflict on a variety of questionable fronts, a film which condemns the violence of the Civil War while seemingly reveling in the violence of the streets, a film that finishes on a shot of New York with the Twin Towers intact, a film being seen around the world. This is a film that wants to ask questions of an American audience and ends up confusing them while I really don't know what non-American audiences are meant to get out of it at all.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just a thicko, lazy or not getting it, but the question that most readily springs to mind is, why Martin, why?"

The costuming, cinematography and acting by Daniel Day Lewis was superb, but everything else seemed to be a half-assed effort. The plot line was cliched and trite, people's accents fell in and out, the love affair between Diaz and DiCaprio was improbable and awkward (she professes her love for him after meeting him two times), and the score at times felt anachronistic and downright comical.  At one point Daniel Day Lewis' character appears to address the audience directly.  Everyone I was with was thoroughly confused.<br/><br/>I am a devout Scorcese fan but this saddened me because this is just not a good movie.  I am not a priss, but the battle scenes were unnecessarily gory, even sliding into blood squirting slasher-like effects towards the end.  The historical aspect of the story could well have been interesting, but it was not explored.  And one would certainly find difficulty understanding the ties between the final battle and the rioting occuring elsewhere in NY towards the end of the movie.

","""Gangs of New York"" was a story that had tremendous potential. The backdrop of ethnic gang war in this era, place and setting was so interesting, it really could have been the movie of the year. ""Gangs of New York"" tells the story of 'Amsterdam' (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young man who, as a boy, witnessed his father's gory death at the hands of 'Bill the Butcher' (Daniel Day Lewis) in the course of a bloody Irish gang street war in one of the most violent places of the mid-19th century. As an adult, Amsterdam finds himself seeking to get close the the man who killed his father in order to exact revenge, while falling for a dangerous and enchanting woman (Cameron Diaz) who becomes the missing link between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher. It all culminates in another, more grandiose street war. The very premise of the movie was fascinating enough to place it on the must-see list of millions of people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, under Scorsese's directorship, the movie is little more than an overblown blood and gore fetish film starring mostly talented, but incredibly miscast actors (namely Cameron Diaz, but nearly everyone with the exception of Daniel Day Lewis).<br/><br/>Appropriate use of bloodshed and violence in a movie has certain characteristics. First, it should not be excessive and gratuitous. ""Gangs of New York"" was both, and rather than adding to the film, the violence and gore seriously detracted from it. Second, it should be necessary to the movie. Although this was a movie about street gang warfare, this was no ""Saving Private Ryan"". More than half of the violence and bloodshed in the movie does not take place during a street war. Nor is it used to portray the futility and horror of violence and war. Honestly, I'm surprised Scorsese didn't have Daniel Day Lewis kick a puppy to death while the sky rained blood.<br/><br/>""Les Miserables"", while not a perfect adaptation of Victor Hugo's work of art, was a far more effective portrayal of street war and rebellion.<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" received credit where credit was not due. A truly good director can make an excellent film without relying on blood and gore shock value and name recognition of the leads. Scorsese shows his true, very ugly, colors here.

What in the heck happened? After about 1hr and 15min I realized I was seeing a story that has been done at least a dozen times. Boy sees father die. Boy goes to orphanage. Boy wants revenge for fathers death. perhaps the worst thing about this film was the ending which seemed completely out of place. I mean who am I to judge how they want to end their movie but if your going to do a complete 180 at least set it up it come off confusing and out of place. Though visually stunning and very stylish, I wanted more.

I'm usually a big Daniel Day-Lewis fan; however, the strange American accent he uses in the film is so distracting, it's difficult to focus on much else when he's on screen (other than his equally distracting hair).  Hard to believe that the director's cut was an hour longer as the film seems interminable during the final 30-45 minutes.  I hear good things about Kevin Baker's Paradise Alley, a new novel about the Draft Riots, so I'll give that a try.  Gangs of New York is one major disappointment..."

The script was poor and above all 'explanatory' - always telling us about the gangs, the Five Points, the social unrest, the Civil War and the draft, Boss Tweed etc. etc. The ultimate act of imagination would have been to create real 3-dimensional human beings and give them small, human poignant moments. After awhile we are aware that trying to be 'real' it is all unbelievable, unreal. Perhaps it was the filming on the giant indoor sets at Rome's Cinecitta studios that give the film its over-stylized and unconvincing 'look'. <br/><br/>With grandiose sets come grandiose set-pieces. Violent set pieces. LOTS of them. Eventually they all run together into one noisy, gory fizzle. I enjoyed Daniel Day-Lewis more as a refined sissy in Room With A View than I did here.

The film's good for a bit of a history lesson and the set is unbelievable. But it's not a great lesson in film making. The script is a bit of a mess, the acting is patchy and the plot is boring, the cinematography and directing is much better though.<br/><br/>There's something missing from this film that I can't quite put my finger on.

","For the first time in my life i feel as though I've been tricked into seeing a movie.  After reading Herbert Asbury's GANGS OF NEW YORK, i couldn't imagine that in a million years a film could be made.  There's so much information pertaining to the early gangs and the beginnings of organized crime in New York City, but there's no real story.  Jay Cocks, the ghostwriter behind the oscar sweeping Titanic (1997), has not used many of the events in the book, but only one as a platform to spin a cliched, boring Titanic-like tale.  So basically, Gangs of New York is historical fiction, although some of the characters are based on real people.  Martin Scorsese's, America's greatest living director, has gone out of his way to make sure to give Gangs of New York a cutting age look, but there's nothing new here.  The battle sequences are too reminiscent of Braveheart, and the tacky love subplot feels tacked on (going to california, bull***t), as it bears no connection to the Dead Rabbits battle with the natives, as the Dead Rabbits battle with the natives has nothing to do with draft riots.  A film about the draft riots could have been much better and shorter but who wan ts to see two hours of blood and guts.  Duh...EVERYBODY!"

This film has been so badly hacked (no doubt cut for length, if you believe the rumors that the original version was 4+ hours) that I would suggest waiting for the DVD, which will hopefully include all of missing pieces.  I found myslef struggling to define the central meaning of the plot.  Is it revenge?  Honor?  Survival?  Is Amsterdam's stuggle within himself, his past, or his future?  This film lacks what makes other Scorsese films so superior---a twisted heart. Usually his characters are so devious, so criminal, so complex, I was genuinely surprised to learn that the only thing complex about this film was the 19th century politics, which by the end of the film became downright boring.  Who should I sympathize with: Amsterdam, Bill the Butcher, or just Scorcese himself?  The one redeming quality was Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill the Butcher. His best role in years, worthly of a Best Supporting Oscar."

","GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002) **** Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz, Liam Neeson, John C. Reilly, Brendan Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, Henry Thomas, David Hemmings.  Martin Scorsese's miraculous epic undertaking of the true life accounts of how old New York survived its initial beginnings of gangs of ethnic and social class distinctions with the brutal, blood-soaked tale of a young man (DiCaprio) seeking the redemption of the vicious slaying of his father (Neeson) at the hands of the truly villainous Bill The Butcher (Day Â–Lewis in a ferocious, uncanny resemblance to De Niro, turn worthy of many accolades and awards; one of his best) in his attempts to thwart the corrupt politicos like Boss Tweed (Broadbent) by usurping the police and the destruction of the immigrant element (read: the Irish) in his misanthropic patriotism run amok circa 1863.  A classic in the making in its breadth (Scorsese went to Italy and had a practical city built from scratch thanks to production designing genius Dante Ferretti,  wonderful cinematography by Michael Ballhaus and impeccably timed editing by vet Thelma Schoonmaker help create a unique look at  19th century history untold.

But alas, all I got was senseless violence. Now I'm all for violence in a movie, if it at least serves in some way to advance the plot. Unfortunately this movie has no plot worth speaking of. All you are left with is violence. As if that isn't enough the whole premise of the movie is based on some kind of racial hatred that I just couldn't figure out, it almost seemed as if the makers of the movie were trying to incite some sort of hatred themselves.

"swezelis","6","2","6","1 January 2018"," Slow, but it picks up. (a little too late)
","This movie was a bit slow in the beginning. For me, the movie did not exactly capture and hold my attention. This was mainly because is was also hard to follow. There were many parts of the movie where I was a little confused. I wasn't sure who was who or what exactly was going on. I do however think that Gangs of New York was very educational. I think that it accurately depicted New York in that time period and what it was like to live there at the time. It showed the different ethnicities and religions that were in New York, and how they interacted and got along (or lack thereof). It also helped give an image to the revolts that took place after drafts. <br/><br/>On another note, there were definitely some sections of the movie that were a bit of a stretch and hard to believe. For example, the first big fight of the movie between the two rival gangs took place in the winter and there was snow on the ground, so you'd think that you'd see all the blood people lost. However, for the amount of people that were lying dead on the ground there was not nearly enough blood. Then comes a scene where two people are fist fighting and there is a ton of blood! Also, there is a part where The Butcher is shot in the chest, and lives. Now I don't know a lot about medicine, but I know back then people weren't exactly getting shot and then going out and drinking the next night. It was hard to believe that The Butcher could get shot and then seem to be fine the next day, only having a sling on his arm.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was definitely a little slow in the beginning, but it does pick up. It gives a decent portrayal of life around the Civil War in New York, but it is a little unrealistic at points."

","Gangs of New York does is a great movie to watch if you want to know what life was like in New York during the Civil War. Though it may exaggerate some parts, it has the basics down. It shows that many ""native"" Americans were angered with the arrival of so many Irish immigrants and how everyone felt of the draft. It accurately portrays the extent to which the poor felt their rights were being infringed upon by the draft, especially when the rich could buy their way out of it. I thought they did a good job of portraying the violence and tension between groups in the area at the time. Although, it's doubtful that there was so much unjustified violence as shown in the movie. The characters did appear to fit in with the times well though. Their speech, including lingo of the time, and appearance did reflect the time well. Though it isn't the most historically accurate movie out there, I thought it did well to portray the time."

","Upon seeing the title of this movie, I had no idea how it would relate to the historical events that happened during the Civil War, but it took place during the time period, so I guess that counts and I went for it.<br/><br/>I'm not professional critic and I am not familiar the director of this movie, but from a historical perspective, as that is what I came into to this movie looking for, I can say it was quite satisfying! I thought the movie was a bit too long and there were several scenes that could have well been left out, but the parts that were actually interesting were the ones that I could make connections to facts I learned in AP U.S. history! I didn't realize how much of an issue immigration had caused during the Civil War, especially the Irish ones! We briefly covered the topic of immigrants in another unit and in this movie they portrayed them similarly to how I pictured them, except not all of them were rowdy, they just had to be tough to fit into this new home of theirs. New York City was a place of where many people of different religions, ethnicities, political beliefs and more gathered in one melting pot and I enjoyed learning more about the culture of the city through this movie that has continued to be the same today. <br/><br/>One thing in particular that I was somewhat disturbed by was the amount of blood and gruesome scenes throughout the movie. I am willing to accept it for now because it made sense for some of the scenes, but it was unnecessary to have it in almost every part. I liked the scenes that showed us how the Civil War Drafts worked and how immigrants would literally walk off of a boat, become a citizen, then were sent off to fight in the army. I can totally understand why so many Irish immigrants protested and rioted about the drafts because the Civil War was a series of many bloody and deadly battles, just like what was happening between the gangs in Five Points! I don't understand why the Irish people resented blacks and gathered mobs to attack them and why did they have to riot at the same time as the Five Point gang battle and bring in Union troops to create a chaotic mess? Luckily, both Amsterdam and Jenny survived, but thousands of others lost their lives, which I thought overpowered the ""good guys"" being able to live and was left with more of a sorrowful ending. I did recognize some important historical figures like William 'Boss' Tweed and Horace Greeley that made appearances and also the political factions that them along with other groups of people belonged to. The characters, in my opinion all seemed to be a bit crazy in the head and I would never trust people like them in real life! The actors did their job of getting the basic theme of a boy who watches his dad die and grows up to get revenge on the person who killed him across, but I wish the main point of the movie was a history-based. <br/><br/>Overall, my final thoughts to add are that the movie was great in and was filled with action and was good in how it had the setting and feeling of what New York City would be like in the 1860s during the Civil War."

It showed the horror of the draft acts and the riots against them.

","This film shows how Amsterdam Vallon tries to avenge the death of his father in a gangs fight by removing the power and influence of Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting, his father's murderer. Directed by Martin Scorsese, the film has a script by Jay Cocks and a cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards.<br/><br/>This film is interesting but, as far as I realized, doesn't correspond to reality. The historical accuracy remained away from this movie most of the time. But the script is interesting. It has some points that I don't understand but it works, focusing on the fight between two rival gangs for control of the poor neighborhood of Five Points. The most powerful gang, the ""Natives"", thought the Italian and Irish immigrants were a danger to America, forgetting that they had also been immigrants in the colonial period (the true Americans are the indigenous tribes who were butchered to build USA). From this seed, the film shows how the US received waves of immigrants from Europe and how it was important for the country. The film also focuses on the civil war, the differences of opinion around it, and the poverty of the poorest sections of society.<br/><br/>The actors were well in their roles but Daniel Day-Lewis deserves a special mention. He monopolizes the film with a careful interpretation of a particularly complex and difficult character. DiCaprio was also good, but remained in a role he knows well: the good guy, very cute, seeking justice. Cameron Diaz also brings no surprises, with her usual dose of Latin charm giving greater knavery to her character, already quite opportunistic and cunning. Action scenes are many and quite graphic, so the most sensitive stomachs should be prepared. The visual and sound effects are good and help to enhance the film. The scenarios were very well imagined, although some of them are too unrealistic, and the same can be said of the costumes. Nevertheless, the film is generally reliable enough to be appreciated. The soundtrack is a disappointment because it has a sonority too ""rock"" and doesn't fit well in a period film. It seems copied from films like ""300"" or ""Mad Max""."
"adamrkaptein","9","1","2","3 January 2016"," Slightly flawed, but overall a good movie
","Gangs of New York,though a massive Hollywood production, although lacking slightly in the area of historical accuracy the film also gives a fair dose of historical insight while simultaneously entertaining. All parts of the movie to me seemed fairly well blended with decent enough transition, however there were still unanswered questions that had been overlooked in production of the movie.<br/><br/>By incorporating a conflict filled time in history with sympathetic and (fairly) realistic characters this film creates an atmosphere that the movie novice and critic can enjoy. In my honest opinion I believe this film lives up to the reputation of a Leonardo Dicaprio movie quite well. Over all i would rate this movie at an 8.5, it showed what Hollywood has been capable of doing at an above average level, but did have a couple of mess ups that, upon reflection are quite annoying."
"stevendanisz","10","1","2","31 December 2015"," A quite excellent piece of cinema
","How did this cinema feature earn my praise? <br/><br/>Well, as any of my friends, family, and teachers can tell you-I have a really low attention span. I tend to judge movies by if I can tell how much time has gone by, and how restless I have gotten.<br/><br/>If I get restless after ten minutes and don't wish to endure a minute more, that's a pretty poor movie. If after three hours I feel as if maybe an hour or so has gone by, and look at the clock with wonder- then, the movie is a truly excellent watch. <br/><br/>Gangs of New York managed to hold my attention for it's entire length; it accomplished this because it did not hold your hand, block your vision, or bore you; it gave a slightly romanticized look into the lawlessness and chaos of early New York; it managed to show the excessive violence of the times without the violence being the only thing. Many action movies rely only on action to carry themselves forth; Gangs of New York managed to have extremely large portions of graphic displays without the feeling that the violence was the only draw to the movie. Rather, the relations between the characters took place upon the context of the violence. <br/><br/>It's world building was done excellently, in a manner described as ""Show, not Tell""; however there were monologues that explained the world on basis. But these monologues and other conversations that explained the context did not feel forced, as if they only existed for the viewer, but instead they felt natural, giving us an insight into the character's lives, thoughts, and emotions."
"tommycarrkicks","8","1","2","4 January 2015"," Solid movie experience
","Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York serves as a positive cinematic experience. While the film can be a bit slow moving at times and some characters have heavy accents that can be tough to understand at times. However, outstanding acting and a relatively interesting storyline paired with exciting action takes you back in time to the battles between the several gangs in New York City in the mid to late 19th century. While the story may not be entirely historically accurate, the modern day movie viewer is not likely to avoid the film solely for this reason. While this may not be Leo Dicaprio's best film, it is certainly still a solid performance. Daniel Day Lewis is also a bright spot as his depiction of ""The Butcher"" is both terrifying and interesting as the viewer seems to be wanting to learn more and more about his character as the movie progresses."

","After watching Gangs of New York, I have a better picture of how rough life was during the 1840's- 1860's. Between gangs and protests against conscription, violence and chaos roamed the streets of New York. I believe that the movie was produced well to show the hatred towards immigrants and how the immigrants survived. Between having to pay one gang, the natives of America, and having to fight other rival gangs in order to keep their ""homes"", life was rough for the new immigrants. Amsterdam knew that in order for survival he had to join forces with Bill the Butcher. This pained Amsterdam because Bill killed Amsterdam's father, but in order to survive you had to work for Bill. The movie also shows perseverance through Amsterdam rising up after his father's death and humiliation by Bill to form the Dead Rabbits Gang again and try to reclaim the city. Everyone should watch this movie to see just how divided the United States was during the Civil War, it was not just North and South."

"stringerjazz","6","1","2","31 March 2012"," Daniel Day-Lewis Is Too Good
","Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely steals the show in Gangs of New York as the antagonist, Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting. His performance is so unbelievably enjoyable that the audience becomes more excited to see him on the screen than the protagonist, Amsterdam Vallon (played by Leonardo DiCaprio). The plot is Scorsese's take on a simple revenge plot, but Day-Lewis' portrayal of the villain turns that on its head with more of his brilliant acting. It also doesn't hurt that he is in a movie that ""stars"" Cameron Diaz, who is less-than-mediocre, especially in this movie. Her performance is incredibly unbelievable, and it still baffles me that Scorsese trusted her acting.<br/><br/>The other major problem that I find with this movie is that it is cluttered with details. Scorsese's ambitions were too high for this film, in my opinion, and it shows quite brightly. There are too many characters, accents, and historical events taking place to actually have a real focus to the film. The tension is unclear because there are so many different things happening at once. It's really messy. Because of this, it felt like I was watching a movie, rather than being immersed in a story, because I had to try with intent to understand the different levels of the film.<br/><br/>Pros: - Daniel Day-Lewis' acting - Editing - Decent cinematography - Costume/wardrobes - Portrayal of mid-19th century politics<br/><br/>Cons: - Cluttered/messy - The acting (besides Day-Lewis) - Length of the movie - Screenplay (at times, characters' reactions were unrealistically written) - No driving tension<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch an electrifying performance by one of the greatest contemporary actors. But do not go into this movie thinking that it is like Scorsese's other films. It doesn't compare to Goodfellas or The Departed, but it's worth watching."
"Desertman84","10","1","2","9 January 2012"," Failed Masterpiece
","The violent rise of gangland power in New York City at a time of massive political corruption and the city's evolution into a cultural melting pot set the stage for this lavish historical epic, which director Martin Scorsese finally brought to the screen almost 30 years after he first began to plan the project in this movie,Gangs Of New York.This is a historical film set in the mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City.It features Leonardo DiCaprio,Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. It written by Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian, and Kenneth Lonergan. The film was inspired by Herbert Asbury's 1928 nonfiction book, The Gangs of New York. <br/><br/>In 1846, as waves of Irish immigrants poured into the New York neighborhood of Five Points, a number of citizens of British and Dutch heritage who were born in the United States began making an open display of their resentment toward the new arrivals. William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), better known as ""Bill the Butcher"" for his deadly skill with a knife, bands his fellow ""Native Americans"" into a gang to take on the Irish immigrants; the immigrants in turn form a gang of their own, ""The Dead Rabbits,"" organized by Priest Vallon. After an especially bloody clash between the Natives and the Rabbits leaves Vallon dead, his son goes missing; the boy ends up in a brutal reform school before returning to the Five Points in 1862 as Amsterdam. Now a strapping adult who has learned how to fight, Amsterdam has come to seek vengeance against Bill the Butcher, whose underworld control of the Five Points through violence and intimidation dovetails with the open corruption of New York politician ""Boss"" Tweed. Amsterdam gradually penetrates Bill the Butcher's inner circle, and he soon becomes his trusted assistant. Amsterdam also finds himself falling for Jenny Everdeane, a beautiful but street-smart thief who was once involved with Bill. Amsterdam is learning a great deal from Bill, but before he can turn the tables on the man who killed his father, Amsterdam's true identity is exposed, even though he has concealed it from nearly everyone, including Jenny. <br/><br/>It's not a perfect film, by any stretch of the imagination, and when there are cinematic sins they're sins of excess. But Gangs of New York entertains.This film fails to become a masterpiece but nevertheless,it's difficult to dismiss the brilliance of some parts of the film.It may be considered as one of Scorsese's weakest films.It wanted to become a wannabe historical epic but it results into becoming a formulaic revenge saga.As for the cast,only Daniel Day-Lewis' compelling performance as Bill the Butcher remains notable. A failed masterpiece indeed."

","Gangs of New York quickly became one of my favorite movies of all time. I can't think of another film like in recent memory. And the acting in this movie is unreal. DiCaprio is great, this is the role that changed his image from pretty boy to badass. That being said, don't forget about Day-Lewis. He's fantastic. I know, he's always fantastic, but not like this. His character, The Butcher, should go down as one of the best villains in cinema history. But enough about the acting, how about the directing? Masterful. Scorsese is a genius. He takes his movies above and beyond what others are capable of. He's truly in a league of his own. The mechanics of this movie are amazing. The sets, the dialog, the costumes, the camera angles, the sound, the music... all are flawless. The last shot in the movie(the one of the cemetery along the river with New York in the background) is easily one of the coolest scenes of all time, of any movie. Its incredible. I have no idea why this movie is not in the IMDb Top 250, I think it deserves to be in the Top 50!!! If you haven't seen this movie and you enjoy watching movies whatsoever, go watch this movie. ITS INCREDIBLE!!!"

This is my reaction:<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio did pretty good in the cliché role. It gave me shivers down my spine with his delivery of certain lines that revealed the seething resentment in his heart. His reaction in the end is priceless. (PM me for more details I guess)<br/><br/>Jim Broadbent as Boss Tweed was, in my opinion almost as scene stealing as Daniel Day- Lewis. You could feel the remorse in his voice as his beloved 'votes' are being burned to eternal damnation. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis... He is quite the actor. A lot of people bash him for being over the top but I think his performance very much so fits the movie since a lot of the stuff we see in the movie are meant to wow us. Day-Lewis takes his time to get everything spot on. From the accent of his voice, to his mannerisms, to even the way he comes onto the screen. He dominates everything, and even when he's not on the screen, he is left onto the back of your mind. He's magnetic, mesmerizing, methodical and meticulous (alliteration intended). That was definitely worth his Oscar nomination for this movie.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: all the three actors above, plus the subtle things in the movie like the dude drawing Boss Tweed in the bare knuckle boxing scene (a reference to Thomas Nast?), the references to Jesus, etc is what convinces that this is pure, unadulterated entertainment."

Daniel Day-Lewis instilled fear at every moment, and convinced me to check out his other work. Knives, guns, and blunt objects are abound as immigrants and ""natives"" clash. It's funny how much this movie exposes those that think they are the ""true American natives"" when really, everyone was an immigrant at one point.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed how three different people were praying to the same God for polar-opposite intentions. It showed how God can be used as an excuse for... anything, including battle (sound familiar?).<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was stellar.

","Gangs of New York was directed by Martin Scorsese in 2002. If you like action, blood, skull crushing, fires, gun shoots, and Leonardo DiCaprio, then you'll love this movie. It take place back 145 years ago when men were being drafted into the army against their will for the civil war, and the Irish were coming in the shiploads to America for freedom and food mostly food. The main character Amsterdam (DiCaprio) is out for revenge. His father was killed sixteen years earlier and Amsterdam wants to avenge his father's name. The setting looks real, the costumes old fashioned, and the makeup, WOW. It actually looks like blood and guts are spilling out of the people. The actors other then DiCaprio included Daniel Day-Lewis, sporting a glass eye, and Cameron Diaz with red dyed hair that does not suit her skin tone. However despite their somewhat dingy appearances the acting skills they showed were phenomenal. Even though movie ending not so satisfying (does DiCaprio ever do a happy movie?) the movie is fun to watch- if you don't get squeamish, in which case DO NOT WATCH the movie unless you like barfing a lot- and it is also fun to hear the over the top language. I personally thought the movie was great and think you should watch it too."
"furex","5","1","2","17 April 2008"," GoNY, nothing more than an embellished, average-looking girl
","Standard revenge story on the backdrop of a historic period which apparently didn't get much screen time.<br/><br/>OK, the backdrop is interesting, but the main storyline is drab and somehow the two things seemed to me too much disjointed. The characters are simplistic and generally they do not go through any kind of developmentwhich could get me to feel for them. In such conditions, the most interesting character is quite obviously the 'honorable villain' Cutting (Day-Lewis), while the 'dirty but good' ones are rather flat and maybe suffering from not-so-smart casting choices: I found Cameron Diaz as a red-haired Irish pickpocket hardly believable and Di Caprio as a riot leader is unconvincing to the least.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York tries hard to revive a piece of history in a way that is intended to show depth and broadness, with a sprinkle of realism. To show depth, it focuses on a plethora of secondary characters and small subplot which take entirely too much screen time. To show broadness, it encompasses events that only bear a vague connection to the main characters. To claim realism, it relies on graphic violence, and a casual shopper attitude in make use of historic events and names.<br/><br/>But what it lacks in its core, can't be compensated by just piling up a vast array of characters, big screen names and a whole lot of things that just happen one after the other.<br/><br/>And if you take apart the coating, it's nothing more than an embellished average looking girl - quite typical for big budget movies in recent years, to be fair."
"hitchcockthelegend","8","1","2","4 March 2008"," ""for the rest of time...it would be like no one ever knew we were here""
","Gangs Of New York remains one of Martin Scorsese's most divisive films, you can search various forums and read countless reviews, and you will find the general debate is if the film is a masterpiece or mess ?. Truth is, in this humble reviewers opinion, is that it's an uneven masterpiece, what isn't in doubt is that Scorsese didn't aim to make friends here, he made a bold as brass historical piece that is the flip side of the sugar coated American dream, the sweet story that is so often the heart beat of many a mainstream picture from Hollywood.<br/><br/>The story is centered around the gangs that battled for supremacy of New York's lower east side in the early 1860s, with the American Natives and the Irish American Foreigners being the principal players, this all plays out to the backdrop of the civil war and the draft riots that would go down as one of the darkest parts in America's history.<br/><br/>The great points are many, the sets and delicious period cinematography are top draw, a true feast on the eyes, a big pat on the back for Michael Ballhaus for the latter, and some of the set pieces here find Scorsese being poignant and on form, and whilst the costumes may raise a smile, the researchers did them proud. The cast of course are trailing in the wake of a devilishly menacing turn from Daniel Day Lewis as chief Nativist Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting, its note perfect in both delivery and actions. Leonardo DiCaprio holds up well as Amsterdam Vallon, a boy who became a man very quickly, and in view of D D Lewis's barn storming show, it's with much credit that Leo lays down a marker of better to come in his career.<br/><br/>The rest do good enough without being totally memorable, Cameron Diaz is perhaps a bit too precious for the role of Jenny Everdean, but she's an essential cog in this epic wheel, whilst Brendan Gleeson is grandiosely gruff as Monk McGinn, throw in solid support from Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly & Liam Neeson and the acting doesn't harm the film. However the film is very much split in two, the first half is grand and has pot boiler written all over it, but come the second half it feels rushed and not fully fleshed out, the ending whilst not bad per se, just leaves you hankering for another 20 minutes to do it justice. Still, it's a fine film that has too many great things for me to ever do it down in rating, so it's a very safe 8/10 for me.......... always."

Mostly everything about this movie is amazing (the romantic portions of the movie, blah).

Life wasn't sugarcoated like it is now (plumbing,electricity,natural gas,grocery stores,MOVIES,)It was a fight for survival (limited food,clothes, etc...)I think that's what was portrayed by Scorsese. The documentary states that there were very few policemen at this time period And their main duty was to protect the property of the rich and well off. Life just wasn't civilized yet.

","Martin Scorcese's Gangs of New York is one of my favorite movies of the decade and deserved some well deserved Oscar recognition, but it like almost every other film it has man flaws from making it a masterpiece. To praise this film I must say that Daniel-Day Lewis was simply outstandingly perfect as Bill 'the Butcher' and deserved the Oscar over Adrian Brody. Also the set design/costuming was done perfectly and is probably going to be one of the last films to use complete sets instead of CGI, while also using amazing costuming which represented the time and place exceptionally. Scorcese's directing was as always, great (Oscar worthy once again). And on a final note of praise the entire cast of the film was fantastic, perfectly casted with quality performances from every cast member.<br/><br/>Although I give this film a lot of praise as I certainly love it, it has many minor problems with one impending large one. It's main problem is that it taps into many different themes throughout the entire movie, but fails to go deeply into any of them only tapping the surface of any of them. It felt as if the film could have been three separate films if they had focused on one or two subjects. Other minor problems can be it is an epically long film that nearly runs three hours and it seems to drag in a few parts but over all has a nice flow.<br/><br/>This movie certainly could have been better but it still stands as a great film, a treat for the eyes, and a pleasure to watch."

"JamesHitchcock","7","1","2","27 April 2007"," Despite its faults, a remarkable film with an epic sense of history
","The title ""Gangs of New York"" might lead one to expect yet another film about the Mafia or a cops-and-robbers drama. (An obscure crime drama of the same name was released in 1938). Scorsese, however, is not revisiting the territory explored in ""Mean Streets"" or ""Goodfellas"". Rather, this is a look at the nineteenth century roots of organised crime in America.<br/><br/>The action (apart from an opening scene set in 1846) is set during the American Civil War. The ""gangs"" of the title are the various criminal groups battling for control of the New York underworld. The film concentrates on two gangs based in the Five Points slum district, the oddly-named Dead Rabbits and the Confederation of American Natives. The former group is made up of recent Irish Catholic immigrants; the latter of Americans of British descent (not Native Americans in the modern sense). Despite their own immigrant background, the Natives detest all more recent arrivals, especially the Irish whose Catholic religion they despise.<br/><br/>The two main characters are William Cutting, (""Bill the Butcher"") the thuggish leader of the Natives, and a mysterious young man named Amsterdam Vallon, who joins his gang. Sixteen years earlier, Vallon's father, the leader of the Dead Rabbits, was killed by Bill in a battle between the two gangs, and Vallon wants revenge. (Bill has no idea who the young man is). To complicate matters further, the two share a mistress, the beautiful female pickpocket Jenny Everdeane.<br/><br/>Intertwined with the fictional story of Bill and Vallon is the real historical story of the New York Draft Riots of July 1863. These started as a protest against conscription into the Union Army, but quickly took on both racial and class overtones when the mob started attacking the homes of the rich and lynching Negroes. Most of the rioters were immigrants who were happy to make a new life in America but less happy to serve in her armed forces. Blacks were resented because the war was being fought to liberate them from slavery, and the rich because this was seen as a ""poor man's fight in a rich man's war"". Particularly unpopular was a clause which enabled wealthy citizens to avoid conscription on payment of $300 to the Government.<br/><br/>The film is remarkably cynical about American public life in this period. Official history might teach that the Civil War was a noble crusade against slavery and that nineteenth-century America was a beacon of liberty to oppressed Europeans living under autocratic regimes. The history we see here, however, is the unofficial version. Elections are bought and sold as a result of shady back-room deals. The police are as corrupt as their political masters, and have little interest in protecting the public. (They make no attempt to intervene in the fight in which Vallon's father is killed). The city's rival fire-brigades would rather fight one another than put out fires. Opposition to the war effort was common, and not confined to a few Copperhead politicians. Although Scorsese shows the irrational violence of which the mob are capable, we also sense that he has some sympathy with the complaints of the poor that, in what is nominally a democracy, their voice is not being listened to and that they have no alternative but to riot. (Ironically, however, this anti-war riot may actually have lengthened the war by persuading Southerners to keep fighting, even after Gettysburg, in the belief that the North was tearing itself apart). The depiction of the riots with which the film ends is one of its two great set-pieces, the other being the battle scene between the Dead Rabbits and the Natives with which it begins.<br/><br/>The dark side of mid-nineteenth century London is well-known to us from the novels of Dickens and their many film and television adaptations. The underside of New York in this period is perhaps less familiar in popular culture, but Scorsese brings it to life here in all its Dickensian squalor and vitality (with the aid of a massive set in Italy's Cinecitta)- its bars, its brothels, its sleazy music-halls. Daniel Day Lewis's Bill, a monstrously sadistic one-eyed villain, who is occasionally capable of touches of chivalry, is a particularly Dickensian figure. He is said to be based on a real-life character named Bill Poole, but I wondered if Bill Sykes from ""Oliver Twist"" might also have been an influence. (Similarly, Jenny has something in common with Dickens's Nancy). The other memorable performance is from Jim Broadbent as another real-life character, the corrupt political fixer William ""Boss"" Tweed.<br/><br/>There are a few weaknesses. Cameron Diaz is never very convincing as Jenny. In a fine example of stereotyping by hair colour, the normally blonde Diaz is forced to don a red wig, presumably to satisfy those Americans who firmly believe that all Irishwomen are redheads. (Similarly, another blonde, Michelle Pfeiffer, had to become a brunette in ""Married to the Mob"", in order to placate those who refuse to believe in the existence of blonde Italian-Americans). Leonardo Di Caprio is rather weak as Vallon, and suffers by comparison with some of the other actors, particularly Day Lewis. The two strands to the story, the personal and the political, are never particularly well integrated. The action becomes confused at times and the film could have used some judicious cutting. There are some historical inaccuracies; the Union Navy, for example, did not bombard the city during the riots as shown here.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, for all its faults, this is still in many ways a remarkable film. Day Lewis and Broadbent are brilliant, and the two great set pieces are superbly handled. Scorsese brings to his film a vigour, an imagination and an epic sense of history that are all too often lacking in modern film-making with its remakes, its sequels and its formulaic movies-by-numbers. 7/10"

Vallon's son, Amsterdam (Di Caprio) escapes. and after growing into an anonymous young man, returns to reap his revenge, yet unwittingly becomes the butcher's protégé...<br/><br/>Scorsese was bringing a long treasured project to the screen with Gangs, creating a hype that suffered from setbacks, delayed releases and mixed reviews. In hindsight what we have is no masterpiece, but it remains an undeniably good film, with many fine qualities to make up for its flaws.<br/><br/>Scorsese's recreation of the city is stunning: the level of detail completely immerses the viewer into an atmosphere scarcely read of in History books. Moreover, the rich criminal world depicted here maintains a delicate balance of understandability and chaos. Scorsese couples this with his flair for music to create a truly intoxicating mood. The photography reinforces the overall effect tenfold, wonderfully sustained and carrying scattered sparks of pure genius. For example: in one shot, Scorsese pans from newly arrived immigrants who are welcomed, given the nationality, provided a uniform, and enlisted into the Union army to coffins of dead soldiers being unloaded on another peer.<br/><br/>Ultimately, a film lives or dies by its screenplay and acting, and herein lies Gangs of New York's polarizing point. Whether you focus on the slightly uneven story (oddly shortened in places by pressured editing) or the fantastic performances will determine whether Gangs makes it or breaks it, but for its sheer visual power and acting it deserves to be seen. Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly are all a joy to see when on top form, but the true feast here is Daniel Day Lewis's grand-standing, violent and xenophobic Bill The Butcher. A role that Robert De Niro (for whom it was originally intended over the years) near his peak might not have done justice to.<br/><br/>See it, make up your mind. The chances of this film becoming a favorite are slim, but at the very least you'll walk away with an indelible character to remember."
"film_riot","8","1","2","15 December 2006"," Gangs of New York
","Many people don't like this movie but I think there is at least one thing that you just have to adore about it: That's the love and ambition the filmmakers, and especially Martin Scorsese, put into it. To be honest, I can't think of any other movie which wants to include so many different parts to a story as ""Gangs of New York"". But therein lies the dilemma: The things I love it for are also the reason why it fails. When it's great it's extraordinary great and that's almost always the case when Daniel Day-Lewis is on screen. There is an almost magical moment, when Day-Lewis is sitting by the bed of Leonardo DiCaprio with a flag around his chest. The following dialogue is frightening and touching at the same time. You forget about what an extremely brutal guy Bill is and only see this man who has found a son. But there are parts in the script that just don't work, as great as they would be on their own. Another thing is that some characters seem to stay unfinished (for example Cameron Diaz) so you can't really connect."
"jouninieminen","8","1","2","29 July 2006"," Worst movie ever?
","OK, comparing to Scorsese's classical cinematic masterpieces, this may not be a movie to remember, but it still is a solid, entertaining story. I don't know what went wrong for the people who criticize this movie, those who say that it is violent and lacks the depth of the characters. I would suppose that these people have never seen a Scorsese-picture. This film nevertheless contains all of its makers trademarks, maybe its a little unsurprising, but compared to a average movie of its genre nowadays, it is well written and just plain entertaining. And if there's nothing else to watch, you can just observe the work of a genius who's acting too rarely, and thats Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher."
"james_norman1981","6","1","2","23 February 2006"," Scorsese's epic fails to deliver the goods
","There was an air of uncertainty about this movie when it approached its release. Most of the reports were favourable: Scorsese's best, DiCaprio back on form, a fantastic performance by Daniel Day-Lewis and such like... But films always seem to be brilliant before they open, Van Helsing was even touted as a great movie before release, as were War of the Worlds and Eyes Wide Shut (two other films by excellent directors that fell well short of their writing, acting and directing potential).<br/><br/>What was more ominous were the suggestions that Miramax supremo Harvey Weinstein had got involved in the editing process, Martine Scorsese originally wanted to do a two part, Kill Bill style piece, DiCaprio was more pleased with his work on Catch Me If You Can and that there were real problems with continuity despite the film's whopping great run time. These little asides, which I occasionally read in newspapers or on film sites (like this one), all provided the ghost of a doubt in my mind that Gangs of New York might just have been a bridge too far for Scorsese and his talented cast...<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those doubts were right on the money. Gangs is a mess: overlong, overblown and underwhelming. There are massive problems with many of the characters, from their motivations to their accents, while despite the time-line involved, with the events of the American Civil War going on in the background, there's little explanation as to just what a cloud the Irish immigrants and New York residents were living under at the time.<br/><br/>The story is fairly straightforward. Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio) is the orphaned son of Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), who was the leader of the Irish contingent of the Five Points, a hotly contested, poverty stricken area of Manhatten. A young DiCaprio witnesses his father's death, in a massive brawl, at the hand's of Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), a larger than life, blood curdling 'patriot' who regards the immigrant Irish as a plague that should be excised from the bosom of his fair city. Bill is also a gang leader and, with his victory over Priest Vallon, he cements his control over the Five Points. So far so standard revenge setup.<br/><br/>Amsterdam disappears off to an orphanage, emerging, supposedly in 1863, as the bearded DiCaprio. He returns to the Five Points, penniless and hungry but with brains and brawn to match a bizarrely limited amount of ambition. Surprisingly, he soon finds himself in the employ of Butcher Bill, his father's murderer need I remind you, and quickly rises through the ranks to a position of trust. However, eventually Leo remembers that this is a revenge film and that he has to take down the Butcher. He fails, initially, but comes back in a number of ways, politically for one, to eventually take Bill on in another Battle of the Five Points.<br/><br/>OK... one might start to see where the discontinuity comes in. DiCaprio doesn't seem to know whether he's meant to be a scheming, backstabbing Irishman throughout or a loyal man torn between his father and his surrogate father (who murdered his first father...). Similarly, like Cameron Diaz's Jenny Everdeane, Leonardo has real trouble with the Oirish accent and both actors spend much of the time seemingly waiting to hear 'Cut! Do it again and try to sound Irish this time!' Jim Broadbent is equally unsure about his morally repugnant political worm while John C Reilly and Brendan Gleeson have similar troubles with their characters, the first a loyal man turned bad-guy mercenary, the latter a mercenary turned good-guy... None of them are remotely comfortable with their roles and it shows.<br/><br/>So why 6/10? Three words: Daniel Day-Lewis. The Last of the Mohecians (or at least his adopted son) is simply earth shattering as the mangled 'patriot' Bill Cutting, chewing up the scenery and stabbing it and slashing it and punching it and so forth. He is a revelation as the Butcher and it is when the camera is on him that Gangs rises above mediocrity.<br/><br/>Therefore Gangs pulls itself up to 6/10, an erstwhile attempt to portray a difficult period of America's history (it never occurred to me to wonder what was happening in New York during 1863) that fails because of, to be honest, a less than clear understanding of what it is meant to be: a closely knitted tail of three people or a huge panorama of a scavenging society in a state of war (both with the South and with each other). <br/><br/>Neither perspective is realistically portrayed, hence the failure, while only one of the actors involved seems remotely confident in what he is doing. Scorsese meant for this to be his big Oscar film and it shows, from the holding back of his usual flourishes to the painstaking attempts to be serious and understanding, rather than his justly flippant treatment of the incredibly pompous world of Italian gangsters. Instead of the usual Martin Scorsese, who has seen his best work routinely ignored by the Academy, we get a man trying to do what he thinks is expected of him in order to win the coveted gong. Personally I hope he sees through his mistake and goes back to making the brilliant films we all know and love. All I can say is: show em two fingers and keep producing Goodfellas, Martin, Gangs and The Aviator just aren't the same!"

","I rated this movie 8. And that's because of Daniel Day Lewis. He is simply amazing and, apparently, the only true actor in this movie. The others are pale and have no substance, but I don't think it's their fault. It's all Scorseze. He used to be so great at his job, but this time I guess he didn't read the screenplay, because Leonardo Di Caprio's place is not in this movie( I mean, come on, Leo beating up everybody, it's just not his way. He's a lover, not a fighter, and ,even more important, the most beautiful woman in New York is a dirty redheaded Cameron Diaz, who, by the way, could have stayed with her natural(or not) blond look. Another thing about the actors is the strangely and very short appearance of Liam Neeson. He's a great actor, but for that ""Blood stays on the blade"" line I can't rate him.<br/><br/>The story is a nice one, I think a little bit exaggerated, but the viewers all over the world seem to like it this way. My opinion is that there was no need for that bloodbath in the beginning, but that may be just because of all the spinning and turning and all the other effects used in the battle, not to mention the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie is more of a theater play, with all the costumes, the colors and the narration, a play witch presents us a true king (Daniel Day Lewis), an evil king, it's true, who gets killed in the final act by the beautiful prince and, of course Leo gets the girl."
"bhbutler","8","1","2","9 October 2005"," Gut-churning, but thrilling and masterfully executed.
","As there are already many excellent, detailed, and comprehensive comments on this film, mine shall have in the main a more general approach. North America (not including Mexico), to a much greater extent than South America, really doesn't have all that much history when compared with practically anywhere else apart from the antipodes. My apologies to my American (USA) and Anzac cousins, but this is a fact. That is why we see the same chunks of American history recycled again and again, with a great many contradictions from film to film. (Though why they don't exploit the two wars with Britain long after the War of Independence I have never understood, especially since neither of them could really be considered an American defeat). One can understand, however, why movie-makers had up to now kept the wraps on, or swept under the carpet, this particular piece of history. Though doubtlessly exaggerated but true in essence, this movie shows us a vast panorama of a variegated and divided community, who like rival colonies of ants slaughter one another to take sole possession of a disputed ant-hill. I cannot recall a more brutal and callous struggle for the survival of the fittest ever shown on such a large scale on the screen that wasn't a bona fide war-film. And, mark you, the combatants, male and female, are, except right at the end, exclusively civilians. Here we see all the prejudices, hatred, megalomania, corruption and cupidity that still, to some extent, vitiate American society even up to this day, and which are the cause of such conflicts. And all this mayhem occurs among inhabitants of that hub of civilisation, the Big Apple, when one would be less surprised if it were taking place among the head-hunters of Borneo in the depths of the primaeval forest(my apologies also to any Bornean headhunters who happen to read this piece). I can quite understand others avoiding or heartily disliking this film, because it certainly isn't suitable fare for the squeamish, and shows ,as I have said, the ugly side of American society that some would prefer to forget. Daniel Day-Lewis is convincingly multi-facetted and gives a superlative performance. How this bloodthirsty bully and the last of the Mohicans can possibly be being portrayed by the same actor staggers the imagination. Di Caprio gives a fairly convincing performance as a young vendetta-seeker, which is certainly stronger than that of ""Titanic"" when he refused to turn blue despite his long sojourn in the icy waters of the North Atlantic.( Perhaps such a hue would have rendered him less romantic, though it did a lot for Mel Gibson in ""Braveheart""! ). Liam Neeson does a short but competent job as a harsh but loving father and a bold and chivalrous skirmisher. By the way, the nasty-looking assortment of weapons used to gouge, slash, and disembowel adds much verisimilitude to the slaughter, before which the ""rumbles"" in ""West Side Story"" pale into insignificance. Cameron Diaz makes a convincing pickpocket, and does her best work since the very different rôle in ""Very Bad Things"". She manages to look much more attractive than usual, so how Leonardo manages to resist her feminine charms after being locked up in a religiositous reformatory for sixteen years is difficult to understand. The camera work is fantastic: the scene where we get a ""de-zooming"" bird's eye view of the opposing warrior bands in the snow is like a painting of Hell by the Dutch renaissance artist Hieronymus Bosch! One thing puzzles me though, which must be the fault of the scriptwriter: how can Bill the Butcher be so incredibly accurate in his knife-throwing when he has no depth vision for lack of one eye? Unfortunately, I saw this film dubbed into Spanish, which, although I understood everything that was said, and the dubbing here is probably the best in the world, much may have got lost in translation, and, of course, I was deprived of the timbre of the actors' real voices and the variety of accents and dialects (all were speaking flawless Castilian)and, possibly, Anglo-Saxon curses, which must have figured prominently in the original dialogue. Had I seen it in the English-language version, I would most likely have given it a nine or ten instead of an eight."
"moviemanMA","10","1","2","2 July 2005"," Daniel Day Lewis is Robbed of an Oscar
","The scene is set as two groups stare across an intersection in the mid 1800's. On one side is the Irish, led by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson). The ""Natives"" as they like to be called stand opposite them with their leader Bill ""The Butcher"" (Daniel Day Lewis). Each side holding a wide variety of ""cut em up"" weapons. Everything from clubs to machetes are present. The battle is just beginning.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese's film Gangs of New York depicts the early years of New York City and the Irish immigration, specifically in an area called the Five Points. The ""natives"" as they so liked to be called, who's ancestors have lived there for many years, despise the Irish. They feel like it's not an immigration, but an invasion. An invasion of there land.<br/><br/>The Irish don't like the welcome they have received from these so called ""natives"". They as Priest Vallon puts it, ""Plauge our people..."". The son of Priest Vallon is Amsterdam played by Leonardo DiCaprio. As he grows up, Amsterdam hates the natives and most of all, ""The Butcher"" for what he has done.<br/><br/>What makes this movie stand out is the acting, most memorable is that of Daniel Day Lewis as the horrible, merciless, and down right nasty Bill ""The Butcher"". Bill oversees everything that goes on in the Five Points. ""Mulberry Street... and Worth... Cross and Orange... and Little Water. Each of the Five Points is a finger. When I close my hand it becomes a fist. And, if I wish, I can turn it against you,"" is what he says to Boss Tweed, just a politician trying to get in on the action of the Five Points.<br/><br/>Lewis's character is one that is both respected and feared by everyone in the Points. His sometimes violent behavior brings pain and suffering to those on the other end. All kneel to Bill, even Amsterdam who befriends him.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie is that you can see it over and over again and still find something interesting about it. Whether it be the actual historic value it shares, or the bloodshed and violence that rivals that of Braveheart. It's a shame that this movie won nothing at the academy awards with 10 nominations. Daniel Day Lewis especially was robbed by Adrian Brody (The Pianist). Movies like Chicago, The Hours, and The Pianist beat it out. But still, this movie will have longevity and become a classic."
"DMM122","9","1","2","3 June 2005"," On a personal note
","Overall, I Loved this flick. Moreover, as an Irish-American, watching it filled me with great cultural pride. I've seen movies about the Irish before, but never has one made me feel this way. I think I owe it to Mr. Scorsese, author Jay Cocks, and the cast and crew for making a film that had this effect on me. I especially was impressed by this as Scorsese is Italian and not Irish. (I don't know about writer Jay Cocks, although his name doesn't necessarily look Irish to me, I can't say.) Scorsese used his legendary movie-making skills to connect with my inner cultural identity and excite it in a way that made this already spectacular film even better for me. I would imagine that other viewers of similar heritage felt this effect too, and would like to get response posts on this matter."

","What must life have been like in this dynamic early New York washed over by wave after wave of immigrants? Sure each wave was looked down on, racially abused. But don't worry they would find their place in a generation or two and then start to organise against the next wave of immigrants, human nature is wonderful. Scorcese had the chance to make a new classic, but you never feel that what is going on is real (when much of it actually was of course), we spend the whole film waiting for the anti-climactic showdown. I enjoyed the film, but can see why it wasn't a box-office success (as it should have been with all those big names) and didn't win any Oscars. Too many disparate threads, too ambitious too cheesy. But as I say a quite brilliant mess!"
"philip_vanderveken","7","1","2","7 April 2005"," Visually OK and some very good acting, too bad the story didn't completely convince me
","My advice to everybody who wants to hear it: beware of movies that get hyped by the media and marketing campaigns. Most of the time you'll be very disappointed by this movies, not because they are bad, but only because you expect way too much of it. And it was exactly the same with this movie. It was announced as the best movie of 2002 (In my opinion that is 'The Pianist', but everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion of course), if not ever and that is certainly not the truth. I'm not saying it is a bad movie, it just isn't that great.<br/><br/>The main reason why it isn't all that great is because the story is a bit weak, at least during the first two hours it is. The film starts in 1846, when two gangs, the ""Dead Rabbits"" and the ""Natives"" get involved into a major gang war. The people who were born in the USA call themselves the ""Natives"", the ""Dead Rabbits"" are the Irish immigrants (don't ask me where that name comes from, I don't know and I find it a rather stupid name for a violent gang, but perhaps it has a deeper meaning that I don't know), who are shipped to New York by the thousands. When the leader of the Dead Rabbits is killed by the leader of the Natives, the war for New York's Five Points has been fought. But the son has seen his father die and all he can think about is revenge. In 1863, when released from an institution, he joins the gang of the Natives, so he can finally avenge his father's death...<br/><br/>I have to admit that these gang wars don't interest me all that much. I mean, is this based on true events or was it just made up by the writers of the script so they would have an interesting story to tell that also shows the lawlessness of those days? I don't know, but it just didn't appeal to me all that much. However, what I did like in the story was the uprising against the Draft for the Civil War. I'm mostly interested in WWI and WWII, but I find the Civil War interesting as well. Apparently the fact that so many people were enlisted while they just set a foot on land really happened and was interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Even though the story isn't the real star of the movie, I must admit that visually this movie was absolutely beautiful. The way everything was portrayed makes clear that we are dealing with a master here (not that I've ever doubted about Scorcese's talent). And the movie did not only look good, the acting in it was also very good. I was especially surprised by Cameron Diaz' performance. I must admit that she did a nice job in this movie, as did Leonardo DiCaprio and Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>All in all I would say that this isn't a bad movie, but that it could have been better. Visually it was all OK and the acting was nice, but the story could have been better. That's why I give this movie a 7/10, perhaps a 7.5/10, but certainly nothing more than that."

It was also very interesting to see what the roles of religion and politics were (or could have been) those days.<br/><br/>I really love Scorsese's obsessions with religion and I can't think of other American directors making a film like this, I think he is a free soul (or at least he is not with these dull times).<br/><br/>God bless America."

One look at him with that ridiculous mustache and accent and you cant help but laugh. You end up hating him more out of irritation than anything else.

","Let me tell you first I'm not really a ""Scorsese"" fan! Though on the other hand I must say he tried to set a movie onto your screen in which he gives a semi part of the American history about slavery, racism, extortion, exploitation, violence and the need as the way to survive in the 19th century. All wrapped in a coat of ""Art"" to what I guess could be considered as diminishing the toughness of histories reality. In which in part, he semi succeeds. The movie is slow but with a little ""will"" you can flow easily towards the end. I guess the beautiful sets; cloths and sceneries are one of the reasons. BUT The thing, which bothered me the most, was the fact of Mr Baby-face Leonardo DiCaprio himself. He couldn't handle the character he was put it in at all!!! Why for God sake do you want such a child for a man's role? Beat me! I have no damn clue at all! Here onto this point my brain leaves me completely, not even one brain cell can come up with even a stupid, ridiculous possible answer. DiCaprio gets his ass kicked off screen by his opponent, who I think didn't even have to put any effort into it, ""Daniel Day Lewis"" acts DiC into thin air. And what the hell does Miss Diaz try to do in this movie? Did she even try to set a character onto screen with some value? Neither her as Mr. Baby face did succeed in giving this movie the strong performances, which it really needed, to make it a desirable powerful movie. Most of the film's value just gets lost through these 2 characters. Who the hell did the screening? I guess bad news for the ""Dicaprio"" fans but please be honest and agree he can't handle movies like this. Anyway, if you're into being served for about three hours of what could have been a good movie if they took their screenings more serious. I would say give it a go and try to avoid Di as Daz as much as possible.

","I normally don't comment on popular films, but I'd heard a lot about this one, so I gave it a whirl on the old DVD player. And I had a hard time coming to terms with what I saw, but saw it I did.<br/><br/>Ho boy.<br/><br/>I have to confess, I'm not a big Scorsese fan, but I've nothing against the man either, and have enjoyed several of his films. Yet this film really makes me wonder what's happened to the cinema going public when a film as predictable and flimsy as this gains artistic recognition. Not only is it predictable, but it's also just over-done on a number of levels.<br/><br/>Scorsese puts such a whopper of a caricature spin on all sides that I found it difficult to buy into the film's reality. I've no doubt the real people upon which the film's characters are based were brutal thugs, but the Satanic equivocation with the antagonist is just too much for me to take. The man is shown to have values, but is also immersed in such an evil dour that one wonders why he's even in the movie at all. Scorsese might as well just stuck a guy holding a pitchfork and wearing horns on his head in the role. Day-Lewis'es character has a political and moral position (however skewed), but it's never fully explored, and is so framed as being evil by Scorsese that one wonders why this character was allowed to express his view at all.<br/><br/>Likewise with DiCaprio's role. Again, another fine actor is placed in a position where he must portray a character whose roots are given a divine essence. As if everything he stands for and values is held in a blessed light. For myself, this smacks of the so-called need to define the ""white hats"" and ""black hats"" for the audience. And when you need to do that, then you might as well be writing a children's novel, because the author has just demonstrated his lack of respect for the audiences' ability to come to their own conclusion.<br/><br/>This kind of social commentary and politicking is done without apology. The result is a film that's pretty thin, and again reveals the inner heart of a man, Scorsese, who himself cannot give a good accounting of the riots, because his presentation does not gybe with the hard facts of the genesis and result of the conflict. And when I say facts I mean that which motivated these people to pillage and plunder mid-1800's New York.<br/><br/>Scorsese did his best. My hats off to him. There're few directors who could've tackled such a project, and Scorsese gave it his best shot. But this film, for all its garnished praises, falls far from demonstrating the true hearts of human beings, and gives us cartoon characters from, what George Parker from Orange County, CA called an ""Over-wrought melodramatic history-fiction mishmash."" I couldn't agree more.<br/><br/>Most of you who have expressed interest in my views on films will probably already have seen this, so it's a moot point for me to recommend it or not in this review. But, on the odd chance that you haven't, and are interested, and are reading my comments, as well as others, don't say we didn't warn you if come away from this film feeling somewhat disappointed.<br/><br/>Corporate art strikes again. Next time Mr. Scorsese please follow your own instincts, or just make a small budgeted indy film with your personal stamp on it."
"TOMASBBloodhound","7","1","2","16 January 2005"," A celebration of violence.
","Violence can be absolutely fascinating. Scorsese knows this all too well. Look back at his career and you can see some of the most malevolent behavior captured on film. Gangs of New York plays out like a big; colorful orgy of despicable characters doing rotten things in a truly wicked environment. There are lags in the action to be sure, and there are at least attempts at character development, but when it's finally over, all you're likely to remember is the violence. Or perhaps you'll still be in awe of Daniel Day-Lewis, as I was. And why not? His character was the most violent.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is a film that cannot figure out what it's really about. It's about a lot of things, but there seems to be an absence of any central theme or idea. Is it about a young man scheming about getting revenge for his father's murder? Sometimes. Is it about the struggle between early immigrant gangs and gangs of people born in the USA? Sometimes. Is it about political corruption? Sometimes. Is it about draft riots during the civil war, and the Union's inability to convince people who hate blacks to die for them? Sometimes. There are also scenes dedicated to fire brigades, stealing from rich people, and public hangings, too. Only in the film's final scenes does it attempt to bring all of these things together.<br/><br/>I'll grant Scorsese the benefit of the doubt and tell the world he did a fine job of depicting how violent New York was during the 19th century. If his film was trying to tell me something more, I guess I missed it.<br/><br/>So sayeth the Hound."
"zorn24601","10","1","2","13 December 2004"," An American Masterpiece
","The depth and complexity of this movie is amazing. Scorsese truly succeeds in giving us a movie where the setting is as much a character as the people. Somehow the viewer comes to feel that this story couldn't take place anywhere else than New York.<br/><br/>I loved the parallels in the lives of the two main characters. Bill the Butcher was defeated by Priest Vallon, but his life was spared. He then rose again to defeat and kill Priest. Amsterdam Vallon could have been killed once his treachery was revealed, but Bill spared him, and act which eventually spelled Bill's doom. <br/><br/>The father-son relationships are also powerful. Young Vallon's love for his father drives him to plot Bill's downfall. To enact this revenge, he must get close to Bill. So close, that Bill starts to see Amsterdam as the son he never had. It also seems as though young Vallon has to fight his own growing affection for Bill in order to try and kill him.<br/><br/>This film could be compared with Hugo's 'Les Miserables'. Both are stories of a set of people and how their lives are shaped by the time and place they are in, set against an epic backdrop of large-scale strife and turmoil. In Hugo's work, it is the lives and tribulations of Valjean, Javert, Marius, and Cossette set in revolutionary France, culminating in the battles at the barricades. In 'Gangs', it is the lives of young Vallon, Bill the Butcher, Jenny Everdeane, and Johnny Sirroco set in the slums of Civil War-era New York, ending with the Draft Riots.<br/><br/>This movie is a masterpiece. I give it 10/10."
"yeah_baby_5","10","1","2","12 December 2004"," One of the best movies I have ever seen.
","I enjoyed this movie. I did not enjoy it just because of the excessive violence or for it being a gangster movie but I enjoyed it because it had a good plot and the fact that Martin Scorcese decided to take a little bit of a different approach to ways his films are presented. This movie is not about the normal Italian mafia crime families that Scorcese usually presents in his films. Gangs of New York is a true story of battling gangs in 1860s New York city during the civil war. I will not spoil the ending of the film but I will state that if you see this movie. You will be surprised about the ending because I certainly was. Overall it was an excellent movie and it would come somewhere in my top 20 favorite movies of all time. Gangs of New York deserves a 10 out of 10."

","When I saw trailers of the film I knew the film would be good. And I was right. Leonardo Dicapreo does his best performance in the film and he does a great irish Impression . The film was interesting, exiting, exhilarating and educational and it was a great storyline. The settings were also brill as you got to see what New York was really like. And the weapons used in the film were knives and guns just like you would see on some gang wars today. The only thing wrong was it was a bit to long but apart from that 'what a film'."

","From the very opening, you know how violent ""Gangs of New York"" is going to be.  The brief appearance of Liam Neeson as Priest is absolutely brilliant and the tone of the movie is set then.  Everyone knows just what a great actor Daniel Day Lewis is, and he does not let himself down in this one - as the Butcher he is Evil personified, and the surprise to me was the maturity of Leonardo de Caprio as Amsterdam, in such an unusual role for him - he was brilliant and proved he is not the light weight actor that I had previously rated him.  Cameron Diaz was fine, as was the supporting cast.  It is definitely not a movie for everyone as the brutality dominates nearly every scene, but if this bears any resemblance to New York in the 1840's and earlier, then we should all have learned about it."
"tjcclarke","8","1","2","16 July 2004"," Lavish and indulgent - a work of flawed genius
","I read somewhere that Martin Scorsese has been trying to get this film made for decades. That is a long time for ideas, plot-threads and themes to be swirling around in such a talented, creative mind. It seems that when he finally got the green light, everything exploded out in a seismic gush of violence and vivid colour. This is movie-making on a mammoth scale  no quarter given, no corners cut, no concessions. CGI is for wimps.<br/><br/>The star of this film is New York itself. Scorsese uses great sprawling sets that disappear into the distance; a vast array of props, period pieces and extras; bloody fight scenes that are almost unparalleled in their intensity and ferocity; and a general air of bubbling discontent.<br/><br/>New York is and evidently always has been a cultural melting pot. This is the 1860s version and the key conflict is between the vicious, snarling patriots and the boatloads of Irish immigrants who arrive daily. There are no heroes here  no moral high ground  just angry mobs of hoodlums perpetually spoiling for a fight. We join the action just before an almighty dust-up between nationalists led by William 'Bill The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Priest Vallon's (Liam Neeson's) Dead Rabbit gang over control of the notorious Five Points district. It is a blood bath, but Cutting slays Vallon and emerges victorious. He goes on to rule the Five Points with an iron fist, exploiting the fear his legend has generated.<br/><br/>Fast forward sixteen years, and Vallon's son Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to the Five Points with a sizable chip on his shoulder and planning vengeance on Cutting. Before he can act, he becomes embroiled in all the sleaze and corruption and is soon fast-tracked to the upper-echelons of Bill's inner circle. He also finds time to fall for sexy pickpocket Jenny (Cameron Diaz)  not bad for a chubby Irishman with a bum-fluff goatee and a bizarre mid-Atlantic brogue. After being taken under Cutting's wing and learning how he reveres his father's character and memory, Amsterdam suddenly has a crisis of confidence and sees Bill in a different, almost paternal light. <br/><br/>You can see his problem: It is difficult not to warm to The Butcher. Day-Lewis injects an impressive amount of passion into a man with admirable commitment albeit to a questionable cause. He may be a psychopath, but he's not afraid to fight for what he believes in and he strongly believes in quixotic notions like honour and respect for one's enemies. He also has a rather splendid moustache. <br/><br/>Day-Lewis is undeniably superb in this film and DiCaprio and Diaz are both fine, but it is difficult for an actor to shine through the grandiose direction. Gangs is littered with Scorsese trademarks  the steady cam shots that swoop around Vallon as he strides out to meet Bill dominate the opening scene, but their impact is disappointingly weakened by the slo-mo and speeded-up footage of the otherwise breathtaking fight sequence. Such visual jiggery-pokery may have graced a film like Casino, but here it is strangely out of place  I suppose he was going for a clever juxtaposition of raw hand-to-hand combat with more modern Matrix-style shenanigans. Whatever, I don't think it really works. <br/><br/>Scorsese also has a fair bit to say about class. There is social comment all over this film and in the main it is beautifully handled: The (I presume) fictional yarn about Amsterdam's revenge segues neatly into depiction of the real-life conscription riots that took place at the time. Indeed, fact spills into fiction during the thrilling denouement when the showdown between Bill and Amsterdam is overtaken by events around them. Scorsese has little time for the upper-classes  here they are nothing more than a snobbish hangover from British high society - cowering in fear as the angry masses steam-roller through their flimsy security and eject them from their own billiard rooms. <br/><br/>Lincoln's presidency, widely regarded as being the fulcrum for modern American life, is here derided as ineffectual. As if to sum this up, William Cutting survives an assassination attempt in a theatre. Famously, Abe was not so lucky. Scorsese's America, as the tag-line suggests, was born on the streets  not in the Whitehouse.<br/><br/>8/10"

How interesting to tell a part of American history that hardly anyone knows about. It was a true Dickens inspired tale. The costumes were so well matched to the time. The set, costumes , colour and feel of the film really brought the 1850-60s to life. The acting as truly wonderful. Daniel Day Lewis, always fantastic in everything, put in a monumental performance which will stay with me forever. A film such as this which not only tells a historical story but also makes comment on our own society should be hailed with all the awards going.

"ajpublic","8","1","2","16 April 2004"," An engaging look into a seldom mentioned history of NYC
","When Gangs of New York was in preview, I grew excited to learn that a master of NY filmmaking was presenting a piece of interesting history of the city. Having watched New York by Ric Burns, I was well informed about the period that Scorsese was about to recreate. To say that his attempts were somehow sub-par would be just wrong. Scorsese does a great job in painting the canvas that was 1860's lower NYC. And by also displaying the trials of the immigrants attempts gain respectability in the new land.<br/><br/>
Essentially, the format is similar to Titanic, in that a closer fictional story is surrounded by the historical truth. I do not know about Amsterdam Vallon or Bill the Butcher or whether they even existed. But their characters do much to propel the movie to success.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the acting, I thought Daniel Day Lewis deserved Best Actor. But I also could see a Colin Farrel in the role that Leo played - although I enjoyed his performance as well. I am not too sure about the significance of Cameron Diaz's acting, I think a large group of other A-list actresses could have done better. For example, would it not have been interesting to see Kate Winslet and Leo reprise the chemistry they had in Titanic? Clearly this picture was better than Chicago and the Academy should of rewarded it as so.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead -<br/><br/>If I could get back to Lewis as Bill the Butcher - As vicious as antagonists come. That mutton in the back of the man running for Sheriff was brutal. And why not just kill Leo when he had the opportunity? Because he was also honorable, true to his conviction in his beliefs. His eventual downfall is his reluctance to change.<br/><br/>The conditions of the environment were squalid. Life was very hard back then. The struggles of the day to day actions would make most people quiver today. The absence of true law itself was humbling indeed.<br/><br/>This movie did not perform as the blockbuster it was promoted as - but if you watch I am sure that you will agree that Scorsese again takes a piece of NY history and preserves it for posterity.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"
"steleru","8","1","2","25 February 2004"," May not be a classic, but who cares?
","This film seems to fit in the category of "" love 'em or hate 'em"", and if asked to choose, I would have to align myself with the first group.  The movie has its flaws ( a somewhat distracted and unfocused plot, a throwaway love story, and a wandering Irish brogue affected by Leonardo DiCaprio, among others), but I was sufficiently impressed by the Wagnerian scope of the whole enterprise to the point where these minor flaws didn't concern me.<br/><br/>If nothing else, Daniel Day-Lewis' performance made watching ""Gangs"" worthwhile, simply to enjoy the gusto with which he brings to life the vicious, Irish-hating gang boss Bill Cutting.  With his odd accent and even odder fashion sense, this character could be taken for a cartoon at first glance, but the xenophobic rage underneath this facade reveals itself frequently in both words and action, letting any and all know that this guy is to be taken seriously.  As both antagonist and warped father figure to DiCaprio's character, Bill displays a complex and self-contradictory nature that begs the viewer's scrutiny.  Here is a man who openly despises anything and everything Irish, yet he has an Irish right-hand man, and in Diaz and DiCaprio, two Irish surrogate children. And, for all his psychopathic brutality, he still maintains his own peculiar code of honor, in which he holds in highest esteem the memory of his mortal enemy, who also happens to be...once again, Irish.  Day-Lewis renders this monster believable and, at times, sympathetic. In contrast, every other actor's performance pales in comparison, but there are no major complaints on this score.  DiCaprio, Diaz, and the rest effectively inhabit the grim world that Scorsese creates for them in all its squalid glory.  If these characters offer little emotional engagement to warm our hearts to their plight, it may be for the simple reason that they themselves are emotionally dead, incapable of any passion but the desire to survive. As for the movie's look, it is authentically grungy, right down to the hogs rooting in the street, but it is also lush and beautiful in its cinematography and costuming.  The painstakingly reproduced New York of the mid-19th century is a wonder of cramped tenements and dingy saloons that sucks you into the despair of a city on the verge of disaster.<br/><br/>In spite of its extended length, I found the film to be well-paced, and it moved along briskly.  I did feel that the climactic ending was a little rushed and didn't quite play out as expected, but that wasn't enough to mar the whole film.  Without getting into any debate over the historical accuracy of the events depicted, I was left with a sense of gaining some insight on a nearly-forgotten chapter in our nation's history.  Not a pretty chapter, necessarily, but a fascinating one nonetheless."

","I don't think I can remember a movie where all the components are in place to create an epic motion picture, and they all fall apart like a jigsaw puzzle with incorrect pieces jumbled together into a mess.<br/><br/>Throughout every scene tension is created leading to more tension. Characters are defined well and the acting is superb throughout ... but because of the history of the period, I knew the outcome from the first frame and it really didn't matter to me who died at the end and who didn't. And that's the problem with the entire production, I really don't care about any of these characters. Plus, the historic and political issues, which are driving influences of the era, didn't develop the desired drama/intensity to close the hoped for effect the director had in mind.<br/><br/>Sure, the love interest is developed, but I don't care if they stay together or not. I admire history and maintaining contact with a city's or community's past; however, because New York is a city that never slows down enough to truly admire and honor its past and the citizens who inhabited those times, I wasn't taken in by the final frames detailing the growth of the city and loss of individual histories.<br/><br/>Overall, the production quality is remarkable and true to life. The acting, as I mentioned earlier, is outstanding. But unless viewers care about the characters on screen, there isn't much to capture their attention for a full three hours.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it a 5 out of 10."

","Martin Scorsese's movie is close to the best American commercial cinema can get. I do not know to what extent the events described in the movie are true, but they come really alive on the screen. A whole world is brought to our eyes - powerful, violent, colorful and you can really philosophize and say that you understand where the violent power and fascination of today's New York come from. This world seems to come directly from the books of Dickens or Hugo. If the American literature did not have a novel writer of that stature to describe the 19th century society, here comes Scorsese, and re-creates that world one and a half century later on a different media.<br/><br/>I am no fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but he is at his best in this film. Daniel De Lewis has already an Oscar on his shelves, and would have deserved a second one for his creation in this movie. There are a lot of other well acted strong characters in this film, and you can feel the hand of the master in directing the actors, as well as in the camera work. One may say that violence is not always justified by logic but by artistic needs, but these were the times, and there are a few memorable scenes to pay back for this. <br/><br/>9/10 on my personal scale for this strong and entertaining film."

","First time i saw Gangs of New York, i was kinda excited, but i also had my doubts (Dicapprio as a tough-guy seems sooo far fetched) I thought i was in for a real edgy film, the kind of stuf that i was used to from Martin Scorsese, like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and Goodfellas. Instead Martin Scorsese suffered the ""James Cameron Syndrome"" (typical hollywood love story alert) i felt like a i was watching a woman's movie. The costumes, i suppose were authentic, but they seemed to take away from the film, like theyre' too flashy for a story about true grit. Oh yeah and another thing, THIS IS THE LEAST VIOLENT SCORSESE FILM MADE. Nothing like The Last Temptation of Christ, which ruled. However, there are some good points of violence, but for some reason, they don't show much. I feel that Martin Scorsese has finally succumbed(sic) to the hollywood system. The film lacked much energy and was too long and slow. What felt like 6 hours was only 3 hours, and could have been told in 2 hours. still Daniel day lewis gave a rather caricature of snydly whiplash and as for leo, he was the same guy as he was in titanic.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese's fall,             2 out of 10."

","I usually do not review movies because I think it's a waste of time, since I won't say anything what the other reviewers already have.  But I felt that it is different with Gangs of New York. This is just one terrific movie.<br/><br/>
Caution: `The 2nd half of this paragraph contains slight spoilers' And yes, all you people who worship `Lord of the Rings.' This movie blows LOTR away. It is much more realistic (LotR is just ridiculously fantastical). The Two Towers is much worse than everyone says it is. It's actually disappointing compared to the first, but the depth of the story in the second is what makes so many people say that it is better than the first, when in fact it is not. On top of being more realistic,  the acting is far better, too. Just look at the infamous William Cutting. It does not matter what anyone says:  Daniel Day-Lewis showcases one of the greatest performances in cinematic history as the gutless Bill The Butcher.' His performance in GoNY is majorly underrated, and will never be given the credit and respect it deserves. Just look at the scene, after the Butcher kills the elected Irish official `Walter 'Monk' McGinn' played by Brendan Gleeson: He sits down to eat his meat, and says one of the most famous speeches in the movie:  `....and then I'll festoon my bedchamber with his (referring to Amsterdam) guts....'  It's hard to find the words to describe his acting in that particular scene.<br/><br/>Cation: `This paragraph contains slight spoilers' Another great part where Daniel Day-Lewis shines is at the Theater after the assassination attempt of Amsterdam Vallon during the celebration of Priest's death. The whole scene is just acted out with such genius and perfection by Day-Lewis, that it leaves so many other actors in the shadow, you could easily proclaim it as being on of the most famous performances ever, by an actor. ( `forgive my bad grammar, but I'm from Germany, and there, one sentence can be as long as a whole paragraph. NO kidding!') There are just too many countless other unforgettable scenes where Daniel-Day Lewis dazzles with its performance to mention them all.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, after all that I've said, and all that we have seen from Daniel Day-Lewis's performance, no one should be surprised that the Oscar notch went to Adrien Brody. Come on folks, the academy, with its blatant hypocrisy, awards `The English Patient' with 9 academy awards but gives Steven Spielberg's `The Color Purple' nothing, and on top of that sniffs Spielberg of his nomination for directing this beautiful masterpiece. I don't think that the English Patient was bad in any way, but the greatness between The Color Purple and The English Patient lies in no way within 9 Oscars. That's sheer absurdity. It never made sense to me, and it never will. <br/><br/>So, it was to no surprise to me (because it made sense) when Gangs of New York went home with 0 Oscars.  But do not be misled by that fact because it does not take away from its greatness.  And yes, Gangs of New York is the best movie of 2002, better in every way then Chicago or The Two Towers, or Adaptation, or any other movie of 2002. I am not even going to go into how much superior and grander in scale Gangs is compared to Chicago. It puts the latter to shame. <br/><br/>Yet still, don't get me wrong. I do love the Fellowship of the Ring and every time I see it I love it even more. I just cannot say the same about its sequel. But GoNY is a realistic motion picture, and it's about real life because it shows how people lived in New York during the middle of the 19th century. Gangs of New York is a film about history that really did take place, that's why LOTR can and never will be as great as movies like Gangs of New York, Braveheart, Forrest Gump, Saving Private Ryan, The Color Purple, Godfather, Casablanca, etc.<br/><br/>Don't misunderstand me, LOTR are movies in their own league, but GoNY, and the other major epic motion pictures mentioned in the text above are much more powerful because their issues and characters are authentic, and although some of them are fictional (e.g. Forrest Gump, Don Vito Corleone, Rick Blaine) most of us can relate to at least one of the characters and find authenticity in all' of them. LOTR could never be as authentic because its issues, and characters are not realistic, and thus it could never be as powerful and ultimately as great as GoNY. <br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 out of 10 and 4 stars because it deserves every little bit of positive criticism. This, in my opinion, is Martin Scorsese's most underrated epic motion picture, along with Casino, which is a must-see by the way, too. Gangs of New York is a great epic motion picture event and without doubt the best picture of 2002."

","Martin Scorsese is many things to many people, but to me, the most important facet of his personality was his resurrecting Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger, and their team, The Archers, from the dustbin of neglect. That should secure his place in cinema heaven for sure.  This particular film, unfortunately, once again reveals a facet of the great director's personality I just cannot understand.  And that is his seemingly glorification of violence almost to the point of it being another ""star"" of the film.  Do audiences really need this to think a movie ""great""? Apparently so.  Would Taxi Driver make it without the gratuitous violence...probably not.  Unfortunately, there is a ""fascination"" attached to violence that attracts something in the human spirit.  Witness the rushing of people to an automobile accident or a barn fire or some such calamity.  But is it necessary to ""make art""?  Powell and Pressburger kept it to a minimum, or, so choreographed it to become well, almost, non-violence...a dance perhaps.  For me, Gangs of New York was 167 minutes too long a voyage on a Styx of red!"

The acting, with the exception of Daniel Day-Lewis' one, was weak. Even Diaz who I really appreciate as an actress was very unconvincing. But I don't think this was her fault, it was more of a bad screenplay. With the exception of the opening and closing fights, the rest was even painful to watch.

While Leo was narrating the film, I heard both an American accent, then Irish  (whoops!) and his character did the same thing.I also realized a couple of the characters in the movie were Irish and not American, when their accents changed-you have to look at the movie differently when you finally learn whose side they're on. Too much unnecessary violence also gives this movie the booby prize-speaking of booby,  you see alot of them in the film too-also seemed out of place. Maybe it was a good excuse to have Cameron and Leo get their freak on, circa 1846. The producers ought to have included good ole'Abe Lincoln in a threesome-it couldn't of made the film any more ridiculous. Sorry, I am normally a fan of Martin Scorcese but if there's a such thing as ""trying too hard"", this is a great example."

","How could anyone deny ""Gangs of New York"" of its beauty and grandeur? How could anyone deny the historical benefits of the film's experience? But most of all, how could anyone claim that ""Gangs of New York"" is a failure? In my mind, considering the stakes, it is Scorsese's greatest success! Historically, the film takes a small number of liberties, but calling it inaccurate would be like saying Picasso's faces weren't life-like enough. Who cares? We are presented with an impression of a world rarely known about. An impression of a dark, cruel, and forgotten time which is brought to life by the most amazing set, make-up and costume designs ever concieved and constructed, and filmed with crafty and gorgeous camera work. Everything else is perfect, what about the acting? Leonardo DiCaprio, regardless of what people say, is a great actor. It is a fact. His vocal and facial emotions are brought to new heights in this one, and it is amazing to watch. Cameron Diaz is also good, with her pristine subtleties in the beginnings, and emotional breakdowns later on. But Daniel Day-Lewis takes the taco as the gross, colorful, and overwhelming Bill the Butcher. He literally becomes the character, and the results are shockingly brilliant. ""Gangs of New York"" will be the pinnacle of New York history movies, if not New York movies in general. It spotlights gang life, racism, the Civil War draft riots, and the horrid conditions of New York's Five Points. Don't believe the negative opinions of this one, and trust your common sense and inner judgement. There's no denying ""Gangs of New York"". 10/10"
"Striders","Null","1","2","24 June 2003"," What has Scorsese created? --- Nothing spectacular at all
","Back in December, I couldn't wait for this film to be released. When I finally went to see it with a friend of mine, I just knew it was going to be worth the wait. . . but, sadly, I was wrong. This movie could have turned out as an absolute masterpiece, but it was butchard. I'll break it down:<br/><br/>I had absolutly no complaints about the acting. It was, indeed, supurb. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful. Though, I was expecting so much more from Daniel Day-Lewis. The way everyone was talking about him, saying that is was a preformance that will never be forgotten. I forgot it right when I left the theater. I am not saying that he did a bad job, but certainly did not deserve awards.<br/><br/>The screenplay is the solid basis of a movie. Without a good script, you will not have a good movie (regardless of who is directing it.) Gangs of New York had a VERY bad script. It had no plot twits at all. Nothing to keep a viewer hooked. Nothing. The diolouge was flat. It just seemed to run on for the length of the movie. And the so called ""love"" in the movie. What love? It was two confused people who wanted to take out all of their sexual frustrations out on eachother.<br/><br/>But the worst thing of all is the editing. Nothing seems to flow together at all. It is just one jumbled mess, that shows nothing. Really! One minute two people are talking and the next two woman are haveing graphic sex with eachother. THE MOVIE MAKE NO SENSE!<br/><br/>I don't think people really watch this movie. I think that they just see the name Martin Scorsese and just say is was great. Well, I really think that Scorsese did a bad job, as did the writers. This movie will not live on as Taxi Driver or Mean Streets did. It is really not worth your time of seeing this movie. Really, it isn't. If you rent it you will just be wasting five bucks because you will probably just shut it of anyway.  Because I don't think that anyone can stand watching a worthless movie for two hours and forty-four minutes.<br/><br/>DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! 2/10  (it got a two just because of the acting...and for pity)"

","Gangs of new york is the best American film i've ever seen. There are so many elements that made me love this movie: Daniel Day Lewis as the butcher(he rocks), the atmosphere in gangs: survival of the fittest, bigotry, illegal gambling, thieves and celebration. The film is about a young man(leonardo dicaprio in his best role) who seeks vengeance on Bill the butcher after the menace killed his father. I'm surprised that this film didn't come out in 2001 because this film would've had better chances for winning all the Oscars instead of a beautiful mind. I was enthralled, freaked out and surprised when i was this film. This has been another hit for Martin Scorsese since he wanted to direct this film for three decades.

The good parts of the film are hopelessly outshined by the horrible.<br/><br/>The overall story that develops is dull as can be. Everyone in the film is corrupt.

","The 1800's is my affection in life. I could only see it in my mind. Nobody understands how I feel about the 19th century. The legends of the 19th century, the Civil War, the Gold Rush, Jack the Ripper, etc. I thought I could only see my affection in my mind, until I watched Gangs of New York. This movie is a masterpiece made by a genius, Martin Scorsese. He literally took me back in time into the 19th century with this film. Gangs of New York is quite a story, there is a beautiful story about vengeance, courage, and blood. Gangs of New York was all thanks to Daniel Day-Lewis, his best movie with his best performance. He had a dark sense of humor which is one of the most difficult qualities a character can have in a film. William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting had the spotlight on him in the entire movie, that I never got tired of hearing him talk or yell. Gangs of New York is, in a way, the best movie in the world because it expresses my affection in the most accurate way you can imagine. When I die, I hope that heaven is my affection for the 19th century. I wish that heaven is living in the era I desire to live in, that's the 19th century. Gangs of New York is a beautifully violent film that makes me dream of the 19th century. In another life, I did live in the 19th century. In another life, I was courageous as I am today. God, the 1800's is my home. That's where I belong. Gangs of New York is not just a movie, it's an adventuresome dream that I can see by day and by night. The 19th century is the adventure I desire everyday. It's the dream I have everyday. It's my inspiration to the gold-hearted person I am today and until I die.

"hernan_amado","Null","1","2","9 June 2003"," Unrealistic and farfetched, however it has some merit!
","""Gangs of New York"" is not an easy film to watch. It's excessively violent. There's a lot of blood and some disturbing scenes. I don't mind any of those things as long as they are not farfetched as they were in this movie. The violence is so farfetched that you think it's only a movie and that there is no way it could have ever happened. The whole thing goes beyond being realistic, so it becomes forced and unbelievable. <br/><br/>The love story becomes predictable and uninteresting. We don't really seem to have any reasons to care about the love story of Amsterdam and Cameron's characters. It all becomes too farfetched. Daniel Day Lewis is not as great as many people are saying. He seems to be too prepared for his performance, so that it becomes what it is, only a ""performance"". <br/><br/>Leonardo Dicaprio is miscast. He's much better doing other kinds of dramas or comedies like ""Catch me if you Can"". You're so used to seeing him as the nice boy that it's hard for him to fit in this part. However, he's passable as well as Cameron Díaz. Her performance is good, though she needs a better script to really show better acting skills. Her performance in the knife scenes is very powerful and strong. Her eyes turn red and when they do, it means they're really getting into the role as if they were living the drama itself. <br/><br/>Martin Scorsese annoys me as always. He annoyed me with movies like ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and ""Age of Innocence"". He seems not to believe in God, since you see Amsterdam throwing the Bible into water (a gratuitous event) and you also see a family praying for their safety, but just as they finished praying, the War begins and people destroy their house. It's as if Martin Scorsese would've said to people ""don't believe in God, throw the Bible into the lake, or see that God doesn't do what we ask Him to do). Those things really annoyed me in this movie, and they were gratuitous events. The movie could've been the same without those scenes.<br/><br/>
""Gangs of New York"" has some good points as well. There are some gripping scenes like the knife throwing scene and the fight between the butcher and Amsterdam. Cameron's performance is outstanding, and Leonardo's return in movies is nice to see. The story is predictable, but you really want Amsterdam to win, so it doesn't bother me. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Gangs of New York"" has many flaws, but it has good points as well, so it deserves a 6/10"

","Well in my mind Scorsese is just about the greatest living American director still working on a regular basis.  This film had many elements of greatness but ultimately I had my share of problems, the biggest having to do with how this epic got made in the first place.  No way, no how was a picture this size going to get financed without a big star or two at the center, and it is that star that was my biggest problem with the movie.  Leonardo DiCaprio does a perfectly fine job but his performance is hardly inspired, he did the best job he could but we was not the best person for the job.  I found him to be one note and boring.  Too bad Collin Farrel was not the hot star then that he is now, I think he would have been far more interesting.  Daniel Day-Lewis on the other hand was absolutely awe inspiring.  Man can this guy act, never would I have thought a year ago that I would shake in my boots at the mention of his name, but his Bill the butcher is seriously intimidating. The rest of the cast is first rate, especially old faithfuls like John Reilly and Brendan Gleeson.  The production is huge, the sets amazing though because there were so few sets, I'd say the bulk of the action took place in three locations, the movie felt oddly claustrophobic.  Maybe after a second look I will feel differently as is so often the case when viewing the work of a master like Scosese, but for now I felt the film was lacking"
"McHuevo","8","1","2","29 March 2003"," The ""Bill The Butcher"" movie
","I went to see the long awaited ""Gangs of New York"" not knowing what to expect. When I got out of the theater I was filled with a sense of peace not because the movie portrayed it, but because it showed the other way around.<br/><br/>
""Gangs of New York"" is a movie about open war; about defeating your enemy by any means necessary, about going into battle when everything else has failed and you realize killing the other is the only way. The movie shows a place with no law but the street law, no order but the order the gangs establish; a place where violence is the common language. This is a city in which the strong survives and the weak is massacred (it reminds me of today's Tepito, Mexico City). And in the midst of chaos there is still room for honor, loyalty and love.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese has done a great job transporting us to this dreadful city. Once again I have to (painfully) admit that there is no need for computer graphics to make a time and place, such as XIX century's New York city, come alive. I guess it is much easier for actors to be in character in a place they can see and touch. It also demonstrates that you don't have to be extremely explicit in your shots to achieve a sense of animal violence.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis and the rest of the actors did an excellent job, with the possible exception of Cameron Diaz. Leonardo DiCaprio has proved again that he can be not-annoying when he wants to. After this movie and ""Catch me if you can"" I wonder if he's only good when he's sharing the screen with a REALLY good actor, like Daniel Day-Lewis or Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>And speaking of Daniel Day-Lewis, HE IS AWESOME! His performance is the best of 2002-2003 and probably the best I'll ever see in years. Thanks to his portrayal, Bill ""The butcher"" has made it into the list of the best villains in the history of cinema; right up there with guys like Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. He's the face of pure undying evil. He's the most powerful guy around, he knows it too well and he will use it against you -personally- if you ever cross his path. I absolutely loved him. I think he is the trademark of the whole movie; I imagine a future conversation like this: -""Hey, what was the name of that movie with Bill The Butcher in it?"" - ""You mean Gangs of New York?"" - ""Oh yes, that's it"".<br/><br/>There is one other thing I noticed about the structure of the storyline. It would seem it was based on a three-act play, the first being from the beginning to Amsterdam meeting Bill the Butcher, the second from their meeting to the betrayal and separation and the third from the separation to the end. Each act has its own climax and the pacing of the movie becomes very slow, and sometimes too slow, in the transitions between them.<br/><br/>The only thing this movie lacked for me to rate it a 9 is a good ending. Me, like many other people I know despised the ending, or at least didn't understand it at all. I liked the very last shot though. The one with that beautiful view of the evolution of New York City.<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" is a must-see. Go see Daniel Day-Lewis in the performance of a lifetime."

"robmclaren","8","1","2","26 March 2003"," King Of New York
","Gangs Of New York Dir: Martin Scorsese 4/5<br/><br/>The tale of Gangs Of New York has been reported time and time again as the story of a tyrannical butcher who chops and cuts, crushes and destroys: Miramax studio boss Harvey Weinstein.  Weinstein apparently enforced cuts to Martin Scorsese's epic new film from a bloated four hour running time to a more manageable 168 minutes.  What damage (or good) this did to Gangs will no doubt be the speculation of movie geeks for many years to come but is actually irrelevant.  What remains is a powerful, exciting and unusual work, which is undoubtedly the first must-see film of 2003.<br/><br/>The other butcher in the tale of Gangs Of New York is Bill The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) the criminal leader of the 'Five Points' which form the heart of New York in the mid 19th century.  At the start of the film he is challenged by his archenemy Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) for control of the points.  Priest Vallon's gang are the Dead Rabbits, they are Irish and tired of being treated as second-class citizens.  Bill The Butcher's gang are the Natives, who believe that all the Irish and other immigrants are trespassers.  A battle between the two huge gangs follows and Vallon is slain by Bill the Butcher.  All this is watched by Amsterdam, Priest Vallon's son, who escapes capture and comes back 16 years later to seek his vengeance.<br/><br/>The most immediately striking thing about Gangs Of New York is just how poor the opening battle between the two gangs is.  It is full MTV-style, full of cuts of blurred action to a rhythmic score that sounds like 19th century techno.  The obvious reasoning behind this is that Scorsese is trying to do something different to show that Amsterdam only has a vague memory of this battle that happened when he was just a small child.  But ultimately it just doesn't work.  It is so bad that if Scorsese did not have such a weighty reputation, it would be dismissed as bad filmmaking. It is so bad that it actually takes a few scenes for the film to recover.  You are left with thoughts of what could have been if this had been a longer, more violent, coherent battle sequence and how much of a boost this would have given the film.<br/><br/>However, thankfully, the film does recover.  We follow the grown-up Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), who infiltrates the Butcher's gang, growing in importance in power until he is ready to take down his enemy.  A lot of people may think that almost three hours is a long time for an archetypal story of revenge but the film is much more than a story of gang conflict. Scorsese is trying to cover much more - he is trying to show how this period in New York's history influences how the city and indeed America is today. Much of the film does not directly feature Amsterdam or Bill the Butcher, but the issue of the civil war draft, inequalities between rich and poor, corrupt politicians and election rigging and rich and poor inequalities. The last image of in the film of New York fades through the decades to show New York today, showing that this time is really the building blocks for the modern day city.<br/><br/>The performance by DiCaprio in only his second role since Titanic - which is a comment on how long this film was delayed as much as it is on DiCaprio's work ethic - is very good.  He seems to have suffered most in the post-Titanic backlash but he is one of the most talented young actors in Hollywood today with charisma and range.   However, Cameron Diaz as Jenny, Amsterdam's lover, outshines him.  It's quite a one-dimensional role but Diaz brings a lot of spunk to the part. It's good to see Diaz acting instead of just performing with her massive smile and fantastic body.  But both are eclipsed by Daniel Day-Lewis, persuaded to return to acting by Scorsese after a five-year hiatus.  He blows his fellow actors off screen with his complex character.  Bill the Butcher is not a man that's all about power and greed but he is a man whose only thrill in life is conflict and who has never really recovered from the death of his rival Priest Vallon.  Some moments in his performance are spine tingling, changing emotions in a split-second.  Day-Lewis is an absolute certainty to be nominated for a Best Actor and would be a worthy winner.  The lead trio are well supported by Jim Broadbent as the corrupt mayor of the city and John C. Reilly as a duplicitous policeman.  The only poor performance is by Scottish Gary Lewis, who plays an Irishman but still sounds like he came from a rough side of Glasgow.<br/><br/>The performances are not the only brilliant thing about Gangs Of New York. The sets, apparently two miles long, are vast - the film probably takes place in fifty locations. After the opening battle there is an amazing crane shot, which zooms out until the people are the size of ants.  Scorsese has created his own world.  It looks and feels like nothing ever filmed, authenticity jumps from the screen.<br/><br/>The script has received criticism for being convoluted and shabbily structured.  It certainly could have been tighter and certain things, like the importance of the 'Five Points', could have been explained better. Perhaps this is the fault of there being three talented but very different screenwriters on the project - Jay Cocks, who wrote Scorsese's other period drama The Age Of Innocence, Steven Zallian (Schindler's List) and Kenneth Lonergan (Analyze This).  However, while the screenplay is not the most coherent or fluid, it still contains several magical moments.  Every second or third scene is absolutely brilliant.  The beauty of Amsterdam waltzing with Jenny holding a candle, a scene remenicent of the 'mook' scene in Mean Streets where Amsterdam decides whether or not to take offence at being called a `fiddlin' Ben', a scene where Bill the Butcher demonstrates his knife throwing skills with Jenny. There are many, many more but they are best left for you as a surprise."

","***THIS CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS***<br/><br/>What a real disappointment!  The plot was almost incomprehensible, it had something to do with Leonardo's character wanting to exact revenge on the man who killed his father, although that seemed like a semi-convenient vehicle to make a period piece about a pretty insignificant period.<br/><br/>
The level of violence was quite disturbing and unnecessary; the characters' obsessions with knives and gore in general (to paraphrase the New Yorker) was almost fetishistic.<br/><br/>I guess if you overlook the cheesy Hell's Kitchen accent and the three-ring-circus (or should that be ""soi-cus?"") costuming, Daniel Day-Lewis works pretty well within the constrictive script and direction.<br/><br/>The dialogue, however, was just plain absurd - every character spoke as though at that moment they were making the most profound statement of their lives:  ""I shalt never dost forgiveth he who hast taken mine father's glorious life"" or the like is all I could drag away from this awful script. And who really kisses knives, anyway?  It seemed like everything the Leonardo character (I've forgotten his name already and I only saw the film last night) did was for attention (hanging dead rabbits on a public fence, practicing his knife-throwing in public, etc.).<br/><br/>Is it just me, or was it a little weird that towards then end when the ships were shooting cannons into the city, every single cannonball seemed to fall within about a fifteen-foot radius?  Come on.  Well, they certainly captured the attitude of the draft riots.  Lots of blood.  Lots of guts and gore. Hmm.<br/><br/>One more thing - America was not born in the streets, thank you very much.<br/><br/>Too bad.  I'm sure the money they spent making this atrocity could have been better spent."

","I believe this film will be one that has to sink in. I think in the years to come this film will have more reverence from the film fans and critics. It is heavy. Too weighty to really digest after one viewing. And right now there are a lot of very high quality films out that are more action packed or otherwise faster moving that are taking the limelight. But once people really get a chance to sit and watch this epic of film and break it down they will find it was more then just another blip on the screen. They will find it to be a modern day creation on par with Shakespearean story telling. The fact that the Hollywood Foreign Press gave the Best Director Award to Scorsese is a testament to how brilliant this film was. How the Best Director could not have directed the best film, I don't know. And though I have yet to see About Schmidt I have to say that this screenplay is certainly one that deserves recognition."
"rbverhoef","8","1","2","26 January 2003"," Daniel Day-Lewis is superb
","This is a film that has the potential of a masterpiece, never is, but often comes close. It is a very good film, no doubt about it. I can't say what makes the film less good than the masterpiece it could be because everything is pretty great.<br/><br/>The story is about Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) who runs Five Points in New York with his gang. They have a big fight with another gang, the ""Dead Rabbits"". The leader of that gang, Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson), is killed and his son Amsterdam Vallon witnesses everything. 16 years later he is Leonardo DiCaprio and he seeks revenge. A lot has changed. I can say more about the story but I don't want to give too much away. There's one sub-plot involving Cameron Diaz as the love interest.<br/><br/>The movie looks great. The costumes, setting, basically New York around 1846, looks perfect. The cinematography adds to this as well. DiCaprio is a good lead although almost every other character is more interesting including characters played by John C. Reilly, Jim Broadbent and Brendan Gleeson. The best thing in this picture is Daniel Day-Lewis. When he is on the screen you don't watch anything else, simply because you can't. He is so impressive, so great. For me it is the best performance I have seen this year (although Adrien Brody in 'The Pianist' comes close). He alone makes this movie worth watching, but fortunately there is much more to enjoy in another good film from great director Martin Scorsese."
"FernAshes","9","1","2","19 January 2003"," Rarely will I give a film such a high rating
","I am generally fairly strict about how I rate films. Rarely would I give a film a 9.<br/><br/>It starts out slowly, the first half of the movie. It actually does start with a bang (a battle scene) but after that, it slows down for the first hour or so. But it's like a good book - you have to set up the story for what's going to happen. Because after that first hour, it really picks up the pace. Scene after scene, the suspence of what is going to happen to all the characters that you've begun to understand and root for.<br/><br/>
So many different themes run through this movie. I've come to the conclusie that it's just as much of a think-movie as a smash-and-bash movie. You get everything from revenge (as the Chinese say, when one starts on revenge, go ahead and dig two graves) to loyalty, power, fear (in more ways than one), even love - yet it manages to avoid the clichés.<br/><br/>Just remember, in this film: is the bad guy really the bad guy and is the good guy really the good guy? Is anybody actually ever right?"
"KatieBug19","6","1","2","15 January 2003"," Deeply Flawed, Deeply Moving - but SO Much Wasted Potential!
","I finally convinced someone to go see ""Gangs of New York"" with me last night - and that in and of itself should have set off the radar.  But it didn't... and I'm not at all sorry I spent money to see the film.  It was, rather, a beautiful example of how even films that seem to have it all (brilliant director, wonderful star power, the largest budget imaginable, a year's worth of industry buzz, etc.) can still fail.  This film, more than others which have achieved this sort of infamy, left me sad.  After all, the story is truly Shakespearian, but a weak narrative line and some sub-standard editing in the opening and closing half hours limit the effectiveness of the movie severely.<br/><br/>Let's start with what I liked, though.  First, STORY.  I absolutely loved the idea of the film: the characters, the setting, the history (even if it wasn't all that accurate).  I am Irish American, so that added personal level.  The conflicts and relationships were also just wonderful.  (Side Note: Isn't it funny how so many of the moving and wonderful films of this year explore father/son dynamics?  In a year with so many strong showings by actresses, that is sort of ironic).  Second, the acting.  Daniel Day-Lewis was simply amazing, as always.  Even Leonardo and Cameron, two thespians I have never taken terribly seriously, really proved themselves!  All of the supporting cast just sparkled, too.  Finally, the physical environment in which the film took place.  The sets and the costumes really imparted the gritty reality of the time (something which is generally lacking in even the best period films).  It lent the story gravity and realism, and perhaps even a little authority.<br/><br/>But all of these things could not redeem the film entirely.  First, there was the editing (particularly, as I mentioned earlier, in the first and last half hours).  I don't have a problem with story lines that are complicated, but there was no clarity, no direction.  It wasn't entirely clear which story Sorcese was trying to telling, and that was frustrating.  The draft riots weren't set up very well.  I felt like the Civil War was a secondary parallel to the violence consuming the Five Points, and then suddenly (at the end) it eclipsed the other story ... there was simply no sense of priority.  And, second, Amsterdam's voice-over monologues were simply odd. They didn't really sound like things his character would say (although many were beautiful, poetic, etc., he's street-wise and uneducated; they also simply didn't fit with the rest of his dialog).  I was also under the impression that the voice-over came from the burial scene at the end, so it was only in the very recent past, which doesn't leave much room for him to educate himself to that degree.  Third, there was gratuitous violence and nudity.  Even for the sake of the realism which I treasured above, some of it seemed over the top.  I especially resent this in so far as it takes away from other elements that were weak and turns off potential viewers.  Some of it is most definitely necessary, but, once again, Sorcese needed to decide which elements were important and focus rather than trying to do everything and failing.  (Note: This is especially inexcusable when one takes into account the amount of time he had to work on the film.)  Finally, there was some pieces that didn't fit.  For example, the music was entirely appropriate and wonderful ... except for the music during the first battle (modern synthesized crap).  What was that?  If the entire movie were in that style, it would have been okay.  Since only that one scene was like that, however, it stuck out like a sore thumb.  I felt the same way about the credits (I can't believe I'm complaining about the credits): the style simply didn't fit.  Sorcese needed to take some hints from ""Moulin Rouge"" which was able to blend modern and authentic while maintaining internal consistency.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Gangs of New York"" is an experience operatic in nature: the characters are extremes, the emotions are extremes, etc.  It contains all the elements filmmaking should, it is epic in every sense of the word, but it just doesn't come off entirely right.  I enjoyed it, but I was also saddened by its missteps -"

","This is a bit of a masterpiece. I was blown away. Daniel Day-Lewis is amazing and the direction is stunning. The film is so ballsy I can't believe it got made by a major studio in this day and age. 'Gangs' is a great American film in the tradition of the best films of the seventies, including of course Scorcese's most famous work. It may not be to everyone's taste - it is a period drama, it is very bloody and violent, and in many ways it rips apart the idealised past America holds for itself. But go and see it and make up your own mind. As a piece of filmaking, it is unrivalled in contemporary America. If the Academy has any guts, Scorcese will get his due, as will Day-Lewis for Best Actor, not Best Supporting Actor. He steals the show."

","For this whopping undertaking, Scorcese would have been well-advised to have spent less of his huge budget on fake blood and whacking sounds, and  a little more on a plot.  The tedium of the gray simplistic, uni-dimensional and incredibly long-developing plot, sprinkled with gratuitous half-naked women kissing each other -- a little male fantasy having nothing to do with what plot there was -- gave a feel as if we were watching a kid at work who was trying to be a big movie maker.  Maybe the ""catch me if you can"" kid. Where did Scorcese get his reputation anyway? Even had his plot had more than one dimension, he would have benefitted from remembering what Shakespeare mastered -- break up the tone, the mood, then to return for better effect.  The monotony of the atmosphere and blood and more blood and whack, whack, whack, whack was, well, utterly boring.  Too bad.  Interesting period.  The good news -- Leonardo can escape into character."

"hedgepuppy","Null","1","2","23 December 2002"," Simply put -- it's just ""okay""
","I'm a big fan of Martin Scorsese's work generally.  I can't tell you how many times I've watched ""The Last Temptation of Christ,"" ""Taxi Driver"" and ""The Age of Innocence"" -- three films that couldn't be more different save the director at the helm -- and I constantly get more out of them.<br/><br/>This wonderful strength of his films, however, is directly related to the strength in which his characters are drawn and portrayed -- both on the page and on the screen.  Scorsese is a master of making you understand and appreciate people you would never meet in real life -- and usually would never WANT to --- and that's due to the script as well as his stunning visual abilities.  I've never read the novel from which this script is adapted, but the script feels quite choppy, and the characters in the movie are so loosely drawn you don't get a sense of who they are -- and why you should care.<br/><br/>SLIGHT SPOILER HERE -- One of the primary problems for me as far as character development goes is that the sixteen years in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character is locked up . . . you have no real notion of what has happened back home.  Fellow Irish gang members who were loyal to the cause are now all working for their sworn enemy, with virtually no explanation or development whatsoever.  Was this a tough transition for them, or were they never really loyal to the gang's cause in the first place?  We don't know. And consequently, we don't care.  If they get their heads beaten in, we just wince at the gore and leave it there.  We need to feel emotionally connected to these people, and that's where ""Gangs of New York"" primarily falls short.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis has been described as being ""over the top"" and ""hammy"" in his portrayal of American-born, passionately xenophobic gang leader Bill the Butcher . . . but the script lends itself to such a portrayal as his character is BY FAR the most developed and humorous and three-dimensional one written, followed in a distant second place by Cameron Diaz's scrapping Irish pickpocket.  I'm glad Day-Lewis chose to make his characterization as strong as it was, because his was probably the only unforgettable character in this nearly three-hour movie . . . and that's sad.  If you have that kind of time, we should know these characters very well by the closing credits .. . if they live that long."

To start with, I glanced at my watch several times, which is a bad sign to begin with.  I should want the movie to keep going, not to end.  As far as drawn-out goes, the time that Amsterdam spends with Bill building up their relationship should definitely have been cut back, and the time he spent building is gang/army should have been increased; there was no explanation of how he banded them all together.  In the final showdown, a dual plot showed up with the draft riots and the street battle that was utterly pointless.  I am confused as to whether they are saying that the draft was bad and that Lincoln was wrong or what?  The final scene between Amsterdam and Bill was anti-climatic at best. Overall, a major disappointment."

","It's late so I won't bore you with much.  Gangs of New York is a great flawed film.  I had more of an emotional connection with the antagonist because he showed a personal side that the protagonist did not.  This is why the film is so flawed.  If given a heart wrenching emotional connection to the Main character then it would have been a much better film.  All I got from Leo's character was anger, I did not get compassion, sadness, or loss. There was too much anger in his portrayal.  The Butcher showed a lighter side, while Amsterdam did not.<br/><br/>Flaws are partly due to writing and partly the fault of acting.  Then again Scorsese should have made the distinction."
"tommyg","5","1","2","22 December 2002"," Interesting History but HO-HUM Scorsese
","I found this film to be interesting -- or at least to the point of keeping me awake -- and very 'Hollywood' in its construction(s) and scripting. There was seldom anything new or especially creative, yet the film maintained a compulsion to mend and blend its quilt work patches of borrowed things from vintage film archives.  Perhaps that something old, something old technique was appropriate to some degree.  The cinematic use of the five point road intersections was indeed efficient and cost-effective.  We, the viewer, never thought that we left the back lot for more than two minutes.  The opening battle between the landed tribes was pure carnage, yet the snow on the ground was dyed Easter egg pink in a very few places which is probably accounted for in its subliminal religious message.  There was a grand leap of faith when Leonardo gets out of the orphanage and returns home.  At one point in his associating with his past, he returns to a deep underground cave to dig up a relic he buried as a youngster.  As fate has it, in the depths of Manhattan granite as he twists and turns down into the caverns dug from by human hands, he finds his relic under full light of a torch still burning on the wall  -- almost sixteen years later.   By God, there must be a God!  Leonardo's mortal wounds (aka Amsterdam Vallon) healed rather fast throughout the story than anybody else's (they were all rapid, actually) as did an ending scalding on the face with a white-hot iron knife -- which miraculously evolved into a mild tinge of color imperfection on the cheek as if kissed by the Hawaiian godds after too much sun on Waikiki (must have been in the DiCarprio contract, for sure).  There was one outstanding genius of director Scorsese at the end of the story but which was also borrowed from Hollywood archives.  Specifically, there is a battle between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher similar to a showdown between two adversaries such as the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote or perhaps Pepe le Pew.  After much repeated carnage (ho-hum) our two adversaries find each other in a fog of bombs-a-bursting or something like that (i.e. stage fog) and there is nobody else on that battle area where previously there were many slain or injured people in this riotous venue.  The two of them are down to the last iota of energy, bloody as hell, and still wrestle it out the end.  It was probably also at High Noon or something then, too.  On this I connected.  I always enjoyed the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote and Pepe le Pew. On the down side of this movie experience, I did walk away with the best part of the film -- which must have been within the content of the book or author who penned the story to begin with.  I walked away with a sense of history of New York City and perhaps other American towns when immigrants were poorly treated, as they became the bottom feeders in the American economy.  That message of power was powerfully evident as the films singular message and which carries forward to this day in both local and national politics in the United States.  (Tammany Hall was powerful from its 1789 inception as a benevolent association to mayoral campaigns forward into1950).  Scorsese accomplished to deliver history that we never learned in school.  American history always has a sanitized version until college and later. My task now is to validate the contents of the film since the script touches American history with some real names to trace and track during the era presented in this film."
"waaf","Null","1","2","21 December 2002"," Very disappointing
","If you would like to experience `Gangs of New York' without having to sit through the film, simply spend three hours in a room with the most reprehensible, unredeemed characters you can imagine and the results will be about the same. And this is film's biggest problem. You don't care about ANY of the characters. Scorsese's New York is peopled with individuals who don't share a shred of decency, morality, righteousness or compassion between them. On top of that, the film's final frames suggest that present day New York, having been built on the blood of these repugnant, over-the-top, (and, essentially, unbelievable) characters, is somehow indebted to them. ""Gangs of New York"" is a weird blend of history, sentiment, and melodrama  and has a thinly veiled  anti-religious sentiment running throughout. It subtly implies that religion is somehow behind all the misguided violence and reprehensible behavior in society. I may be reading too much into this, but the theme is definitely present, and one that needs to be either fairly explored or abandoned altogether.  I have to agree with a comment made by an earlier poster: Less IS more, Mr. Scorsese. Less is definitely more."

","Martin Scorsese once again does a period piece set in New York in 1862. Why? Wasn't ""Age of Innocence"" bad enough?<br/><br/>Story is supposed to be about a boy (Leonardo DiCaprio) out to avenge his fathers (Liam Neeson) death at the hands of William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis). But the screenwriters try to shoehorn in every single event happening in NYC in the 1860s. There's abolition, the Union Army, the Draft Riots, bigotry, murder, immigrants, racism, robbery etc etc etc. It's too much for one movie to hold and most of it has precious little to do with the main story. More often than not I was confused and bored by these constant detours from the story. I twice considered walking out because I was so bored--a few people did leave.<br/><br/>Also the dialogue in this movie is horrible--when you can understand it. Day-Lewis adopts a very strange annoying accent and DiCaprio unwisely tries to do an Irish accent (which comes and goes throughout the movie). Cameron Diaz as con artist Jenny Everdeane wisely doesn't try. As for the acting....weellllllll...what can you say about a movie where DiCaprio gives the best performance? He's lousy but he's better than anybody else. Day-Lewis growls, yells and chews the scenery to a ridiculous degree and Diaz has the hopeless bad girl with the heart of gold role--she deserves much better than this.<br/><br/>The movie is hellishly long at 2 hours and 45 minutes. It looks great but it's dull, badly written, badly acted, surprisingly badly directed and totally unfocused.<br/><br/>A real disappointment. Probably Scorsese's worst film to date.

DiCaprio, on the other hand, was almost cardboard and frankly I've seen better drama from the protagonist on ""The Benny Hill Show."" Perhaps less time spent pondering his own legendary acting skills and more time considering what real people look and behave like would be well spent. <br/><br/>Cameron Diaz looks and behaves like she's dressed up for Halloween in this one, she never convinced me her character had the least interest in anyone around her or in anything going on. <br/><br/>The shot at the end where the graves are seen in front of an increasingly modernized, more familiar NYC was disliked by several people I spoke to for some reason or other but I actually enjoyed it and thought it was a good touch. <br/><br/>3 points for the morphing NYC time-lapse scene<br/><br/>-4 points for DiCaprio<br/><br/>-2 points for Diaz (at least she had less dialogue than the leading man).<br/><br/>-1 for the soundtrack<br/><br/>Don't rent.

You know, those cheap-o movies with only two sets that look fake and flat. Oh wait.... it was exactly like a 1950s live TV drama. Those were excusable in the early days of television--- all the action takes place on essentially the same set on a small stage. But in these modern times?<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" may disconcert some because the historical premises are not widely known. But the problems with ""Gangs of New York"" go far beyond any potential discomfort with those novelties.<br/><br/>As an epic, this is too stylized. As a style piece, it isn't stylistic enough. It has a claustrophobic feel--- as if all the action takes place on the same small set. Cut-aways to an artist's drawing of Manhattan at the beginning and the end of the movie try to give us a geography and a context, but they only remind us we are NOT seeing a large city. The suffocatingly small sets are more suited to a stage musical, and an old stale one at that--- something forgettable from the 70s.<br/><br/>I was reminded of ""Goodfellas""--- a movie that film essayists and others revere. I saw it, and was affected by its ugliness and brutality. Why did Scorcese feel the need to make that one? ""Goodfellas"" is so ugly as to be a psychic and emotional pollution, a form of ""vibe abuse."" ""Gangs of New York"" is similar--- one wonders what Scorcese's point was. Are we supposed to think that immigrants were crazy? That Europeans were nuts? That Irish are ""bad""? Or, Irish are ""good""? New York had a past? The mid 1800's sucked as a century? I think everybody's life the world over sucked in those days. Remember, the real-life historical Irish evidently thought what they had in New York, Daniel Day-Lewis, Jim Broadbent, Cameron Diaz and all--- was nonetheless better than what they had fled in Britain.<br/><br/>But what's the point here?

","Just returned from a Writer's Guild screening of ""Gangs of New<br/><br/>York,"" and the news is not good.  The movie certainly has its nice<br/><br/>moments (I would hope so -- at close to three hours you should<br/><br/>stumble on good moments every once in a while) but overall, it<br/><br/>simply does not work.  It fails as entertainment.<br/><br/>Chief among the problems is the movie's pedantic approach to its<br/><br/>subject.  ""Gangs"" comes off like the history lecture you fell asleep<br/><br/>in in college.  There are long sequences that attempt to give the<br/><br/>bigger picture of the social struggles in Civil War-era New York. <br/><br/>Each of these sequences is accompanied by on-the-nose voiceover that tells us nothing more than what we are seeing. <br/><br/>There's no dramatic core to it.  Granted -- this is an under-reported<br/><br/>era in our nation's history, when ideas of patriotism and civic duty<br/><br/>clashed with the reality that the country was built on the backs of<br/><br/>immigrants.  But for God's sake, if you're going to teach history,<br/><br/>make a documentary.<br/><br/>Scorcese (and Pileggi) used voiceover to virtuoso effect in<br/><br/>""Goodfellas.""  But that voiceover had its own idiom, the language of<br/><br/>the streets that Scorcese loves so well.  And it had a point of view: <br/><br/>Henry Hill's narration crackled with the energy of a man falling in<br/><br/>love with crime.  DiCaprio's voiceover is as deadly dull as a<br/><br/>Sunday School lecture.  And what's worse, he loses his accent half<br/><br/>the time.  On top of it, the words themselves simply report the<br/><br/>action, or, lacking drama, become too flowery.  The screenwriters<br/><br/>strain to create emotion when none is there.<br/><br/>At the WGA screening, two of the screenwriters attested that<br/><br/>Scorcese hired a third, Ken Lonergan, to add the voiceover after<br/><br/>everything else had been written.  I have no idea why this was<br/><br/>done.  It's completely superfluous and it hurts the movie.<br/><br/>On to the acting.  I'm afraid the news doesn't get much better.<br/><br/>
Everyone is falling over themselves saying how great Daniel Day<br/><br/>Lewis was.  Take a step back, people.  Lewis certainly has<br/><br/>charisma to spare.  But half the time he seems to be doing a bad<br/><br/>Deniro impression.  His scenery-chewing gets more and more<br/><br/>over the top as the movie goes on.  This performance is about on<br/><br/>par with Tim Roth's performance in ""Rob Roy.""  What?  You say<br/><br/>you don't remember that?  Exactly.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz looks ridiculously out of place in this movie.  I'm<br/><br/>sorry to say it, because I love her work, and she normally makes<br/><br/>smart choices.  Not this time.  I just don't buy her as a whoring<br/><br/>orphan pickpocket. She tries very hard, and she even brings<br/><br/>humor and spark to the role.  But come on!  You can't have it both<br/><br/>ways!  You can't tell us how rough and tumble the streets of New<br/><br/>York were in 1860, and then show us Cameron Diaz as a pickpocket, looking like she just finished a revlon commercial!<br/><br/>People will be put off by the violence.  Some will be horrified by it.  I<br/><br/>don't mind the violence.  I just didn't care about it at all.  It was all<br/><br/>so predictable and pat.  There were SO many characters, and SO<br/><br/>MANY get killed, that in the end you didn't feel that much for any<br/><br/>one of them.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my final beef.  LESS IS MORE.  Less, Marty, is<br/><br/>MORE.  This movie was three hours long because it is trying to<br/><br/>trick people into thinking it is ""Epic"" and ""Artsy.""  In other words,<br/><br/>they're hoping it will be nominated for Best Picture before anyone<br/><br/>can figure out that it isn't any good.  And it just may work.  But if the<br/><br/>movie had been trimmed down by about an hour (removing the<br/><br/>last forty minutes would have helped), it would have benefitted<br/><br/>greatly.  As long as the story focused on the main three characters,<br/><br/>it at least worked as melodrama.  When it tried to bring in the<br/><br/>bigger, sprawling historical context, it became muddled, tiresome<br/><br/>and completely without drama.<br/><br/>I'm not taking anything away from Martin Scorcese.  Even the great<br/><br/>ones miss once in a while.  But don't see this movie unless you've<br/><br/>got a lot of time and you can forgive a lot of faults."

","The Plot - sort of a West Side Story for the post-Colonial age, with Irish immigrants fighting their ""native"" oppressors. One of the ringleaders of the ""natives"" is a ferocious, cantankerous, and most likely insane fellow with a glass eye known as William Cutting, AKA: Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis); based on a real person. Bill the Butcher kills the leader of an Irish gang called the Dead Rabbits, that leader being ""Priest"" Vallon (Liam Neeson) during a gang fight. Years later, Vallon's son, Amsterdam (Leonardo Dicaprio) having achieved adulthood, seeks revenge on Bill (who hasn't aged a day), but first infiltrates Bill's gang and becomes a kind of student to him. Later Amsterdam gets involved with pretty thief Jenny (Cameron Diaz), who has a sordid, seedy past with Bill the Butcher. Love, lust, betrayal, the Draft Riots, chaos and mayhem ensues.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is a mess. An ambitious, beautiful looking mess, but a mess all the same. Despite it's lofty dreams of examining the oft forgotten trouble of the time period and having the much beloved director Martin Scorsese at the helm, the film never really becomes cohesive and the characters are for the most part not all that likable or interesting. Perhaps the biggest disappointment is Daniel Day-Lewis, one of the most charismatic and engaging actors of his generation, but one whose film output is so sporadic that he was missing in action for five years before making this, his much hailed return to the cinematic screen. And, unfortunately, Day-Lewis gives a Razzie worthy performance. Whatever skill or passion or dedication he put into the character just doesn't transfer well to the screen. In the end, Day-Lewis, complete with an irritating accent, comes across as being little more than a one-note cartoon villain. I can only assume that the character looked better on paper. The film also wastes Liam Neeson, who appears only too briefly as the stalwart Irishman whose courage inspired all and impressed Bill. Perhaps a more engaging story could have been found in focusing on the conflict between Day-Lewis and Neeson, but alas, this was not to be."

","Well this movie was alright, it wasn't fantastic, and it wasn't brilliant, but the fact the promotion for this film was huge, and i feel it was over promoted, thats why i didn't like this film as much as i wanted to. At times the film really sucked bad, including the main talking parts,they were boring and since i was watching this film at night, i nearly dropped off and i wasn't even tired. However the fighting sequences were good and kept me awake. This film is a film id wait to watch again in about 10 years time or something. And also this isn't a film i'd consider to be for an impatient person, since the (as i mentioned before) the talking scenes drag on a bit. But i feel this film is lucky to get a 4/10 from me because although it sucked a lot, it was a very powerful piece from Martin Scorsese and the soundtrack was good, Martin put in effort, and got a half decent movie out of it. On a final note, I was quite glad to see the credits..eventually."

","It's very difficult for me to criticize Martin Scorsese, but he really didn't live up to some of the other titles in his catalog with this one.<br/><br/>It starts off set in pre-Civil War era New York with a well-picked cast and an overall look and feel that creates an eye-catching backdrop for a less interesting story. Daniel Day-Lewis creates an extremely charismatic and likable villain as Bill the Butcher, which is really the films only saving grace. The first hour of the film is good, but it soon fizzles into a predictable plot and thereafter becomes a Peter Pan vs. Captain Hook-like epic between Bill the Butcher and the Priest's Son, played by Leo DiCaprio. Leonardo DiCaprio has a boyish tone in his voice and overall look that makes any 'grown-up' role he tries to play seem over-stretched. I'm really not a fan of him, I might have liked the film a bit more if someone else was cast as the lead. Like I had mentioned before, I found myself not caring about the plot or the characters about halfway through the film. Very Disappointing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if your a fan of Daniel Day-Lewis, I'd recommend it just to watch him be the only person who even TRIES to salvage this film. In all honesty its worth it to stomach this film once through the watch his performance.<br/><br/>If your a fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, I'd recommend it for the typical role he plays in it.. (Titanic, anyone?)<br/><br/>If your a fan of Martin Scorsese, I don't recommend it at all. Fans of 'Raging Bull' and 'GoodFellas' probably are not going to sit through it."

","Martin Scorsese's big, confused, drab and ultimately empty slice of American history seems to be yet another attempt by the director to show how violent and ruthless men are and how corrupt the American dream is.<br/><br/>
Played out on a giant, rambling set showing lower Manhattan during the Civil War (and filmed, ironically enough in Italy), Scorsese once again reduces human intercourse to the level of gang warfare, vengeance, power plays and simple greed. Heaven forbid he show any aspect of the American landscape that would hint at anything but the basest of motives.<br/><br/>
The story, consisting on the most cliched elements of a love triangle and a trite revenge melodrama, serves as the backdrop for Scorsese's depiction of the most squalid aspects of life in New York City; and from that aspect, the film is a set designers dream. The seedy look of the film is admirable. But as an examination of America as the great melting pot, his old immigrant vs. new immigrant saga comes off as simplistic, at best.<br/><br/>Plus the long-winded and convoluted narrative is populated with one-dimensional characters, not the least of which are those played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz. Though widely praised, the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, as the films oversized villain, is stiff, flat and unconvincing. <br/><br/>This wannabe epic was desperately in need of a couple more rewrites before filming should have commenced in order to give it a compelling story, any strong characters or a real reason to exist in the first place."

And is it just the director's fault ? Well, eventually it is of course. But some others take the blame as well. Photography is a downright example of 'lot of money, let's do it the easy way', so unlike other movies by Scorsese. The acting by Cameron Diaz is probably the worst i've seen yet in a production even 1/8th this big. The scene where she's inevitably kissing DiCaprio is acted as if it's a lines run-through. I kept wondering when Ben Stiller would pop up. Anyway, hugely overrated, under-acted, under-shot, miss directed way one hour too long campy saga.

"Li-1","Null","2","8","27 September 2003"," I suspect it'll be a forgotten film in ten years.
","* 1/2 out of ****<br/><br/>You know how every year, there are usually a few best picture nominees that are completely forgotten and when you look back on them you wonder why they were even nominated in the first place.  Well, Gangs of New York is one such picture.  I have yet to see The Hours or The Pianist (heard nothing but great things about the latter), but so far, I've been quite disappointed by the crop of 2002 best picture nominees.  <br/><br/>The plot to Gangs is really quite simple.  Leondardo Dicaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon, whose father was murdered in a gang war by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) for control of the Five Points in lower Manhattan.  Vallon, as a young man, returns to avenge his father's death, but becomes conflicted when Bill takes him under his care.  There's also a lazily inserted love story that's purely on auto-pilot.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is a film that's hard to categorize.  Primarily, I'd say it's a drama, but a drama about what?  The titular gangs are hardly given much depth or development, a surprise coming from director Martin Scorcese, the man who gave us Goodfellas.  Almost as damning is the fact that Vallon's burning desire for revenge is hardly touched on (yup, after the prologue, we skip several years later).  Instead, the movie often gives way to Dicaprio's love story with Cameron Diaz, and the two share the flattest romantic chemistry I've seen in recent years.  Any scene just featuring these two is a pain to watch.<br/><br/>The opening battle sequence, while sufficiently brutal and violent, is a mess of a scene, looking more like a setpiece suitable for MTV than an epic drama.  I'm talking about headache-inducing quick cuts, herky-jerky slow motion, cheesy wide angle shots, and extreme close-ups.  Almost all the power of the scene is sucked out by Scorcese's odd directing choices. <br/><br/>
Keeping the movie afloat and semi-watchable are Day-Lewis' performance as Bill and the production design.  At least the film captures the look of the time period, if not necessarily the feel (in all honestly, I'm not sure what the ""feel"" would be like, given that I've never actually seen a movie about gangs of new york set in the 1860's).  Day-Lewis is fine in his role, shining comfortably while most everyone else tends to slink into the background.<br/><br/>Scorcese hasn't done much worth mentioning lately, his last solid film being Casino, which was a virtual remake of his best work, Goodfellas.  Running at nearly three hours, Gangs of New York feels even longer than it is, probably the harshest criticism I could give to a so-called epic."

","People have said that if you'd like Titanic, then you'll like this. I think that is a fair comment, since the accuracy of this film is probably equivalent, as is having a drivelling romance story to drive the plot (coupled with a revenge story), both of which are poorly played out. The only good thing about the film was Daniel Day-Lewis's portrayal of Bill the Butcher. Not altogether a bad film, so if you're bored, then by all means watch it.

Sadly, it let me down.<br/><br/>I should have known it would be a yawner when the starting fight bored me. All slow motion, fake looking blood, and not at all exciting. It proved to be a movie that had a lot of drag to it and I find my mind wandering at times and myself just taking in the whole look of the film, the sets, the clothing, the background players, ect.<br/><br/>I also should have been prepared when I saw the first error in the movie right at the beginning of the film! The cut on ""Priest"" Vallon's face kept changing sides on his face and appearing/disappearing. I noticed it on the first viewing so I know that it is obvious. If the first minutes contain an error like that, that is so noticable, then it shows that the movie will not be that great. It shows some slackness on the moviemaker's side when this sort of thing happens.<br/><br/>The acting was decent...I just wish the actors where in a better movie than this. Cameron Diaz really stands out in my mind because she did a very good performance in this film...and she was hardly recognizable as the blonde, peppy, bubblehead she usually plays in films.<br/><br/>I did like the look of ""Old New York"" and the clothing. It's just too bad the story is not as good as the whole ""look"" of the movie.

The fact that he also looks a bit like him on screen makes it look comic to me.<br/><br/>
Day Lewis' character is a one-eyed butcher who can throw knives with an accuracy better than a centimeter. This is impossible if you don't have stereo vision. Di Caprio's character claims that 15,000 Irish were arriving per week in the 1860s - I don't think so, perhaps one week during 1840s but not afterwards. Clearly not much research was done. It looks as if Scorses read up on lots of amazing facts about 19c New York and decided that they were all true and happened all the time.<br/><br/><SPOILERS><br/><br/>By the end of the film I was cheering for the marines to massacre all these lawless savages.<br/><br/>

","SPOILER----SPOILER-----SPOILER<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is a violent drama set in New York's Five Points area in 1861-62; it uses the American Civil War [more on this later] as a backdrop. This period has massive Irish Catholic immigration; their large numbers and willingness to work for less threaten the native born' [mostly Protestants] and social structure in Northeast Cities like NYC.  Age-old religious bigotry comes along as excess baggage and the melting pot' becomes a boiling cauldron.  A child, nicknamed Amsterdam, is orphaned when the native-born gang leader Bill the Butcher [Daniel Day-Lewis] kills his father.  Amsterdam [Leonardo DiCaprio] returns to the scene as a man seeking calculated revenge.  As young men will do, he is fascinated by Jenny [Cameron Diaz] a pickpocket by day and a ward of the Butchers by night.  The story builds to a crescendo as riots erupt with institution of a draft by Lincoln to staff the Union Army.  <br/><br/>Gangs of New York leaves much to be desired as pure entertainment.  At a superficial level, this film is over the top with violence, costumes, sets and action.  It looks more like a surreal Kevin Coster creative failure [Water World and The Postman come to mind] than a movie with a message.  The characters are not sympathetic, although Diaz is so good in her part that she's almost unrecognizable and Day-Lewis is a legitimate villain.  A major problem with this film is that five [5] minutes into the story you know exactly how it's going to end a mere 2hrs 48 min later , almost 3 hours].  The only question is how many heads get bashed in the process. <br/><br/>
Gangs of New York is directed by film great Martin Scorsese and distributed by Miramax Films who pride themselves in picking Oscar winners; the latter point explains all the publicity hype around the film.  Scorsese and Miramax wouldn't waste their resources on a period version of The Godfather or West Side Story [for you romantics]; if that's all you're expecting save your time and money.  This film is open to multiple interpretations.  The story is a metaphor for the Civil War and Abraham Lincoln's successful effort to save the Union and create one nation.  The gangs represent the war between two peoples with a common language and homeland.  Irish immigrants stepping of the boats and unknowingly enlisted in the Union army parallel Africans sold into slavery.  Coffins being off-loaded from the same boats show the senselessness of slavery.  The draft induced civilian riots ultimately end in destruction of the gangs, unity among the immigrants and civilian order established by Federal troops showing that the Union is saved.  That's my story and I'm sticking with it."

Not to say that it's a bad movie, but it's forgettable for the most part. However, the time-lapse at the end kind of gave me an appreciation for the entire movie up to that point. It gave all of the violence and sacrifice of the movie meaning, and showed that it all paved the way for the descendants of the Irish to have a future in America. I'm not sure of my exact heritage, but I know that I'm American born with a decent amount of Irish blood in me, and I think that fact in itself is proof that the fight to be part of the American dream was achieved long ago by somebody. Whether I'll actually go back and watch this movie again is questionable. Things got a little bogged down and political for my taste, though there was a decent theme of what being an American means in it that even has relevance to immigration today.

Not perhaps up there with the best of his best works, such as TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, and CASINO, but certainly a top tier film that never disappoints from beginning to end despite the ample length and in-depth nature of the screenplay.<br/><br/>GANGS OF NEW YORK looks brilliant, with huge and elaborate sets, stirring music, great choreography, and period detail. This is a film that offers a vision of New York as never seen before; a city in its infancy, riven by gang violence. There are wonderful performances from everybody in the film, but standing above them all is Daniel Day-Lewis, who gives the best performance I've ever seen from this actor: absolutely fantastic, true-to-life work. Leonardo DiCaprio isn't quite great, but he's making a useful transition here from annoying teenage star of TITANIC to the subtle and complex performer of THE DEPARTED.<br/><br/>This film is very dark, grimy, and brutally violent in places, but then it needs to be. Although lengthy, the story is consistently engaging with the characters evolving and interacting with each other. It's finished off with a bleak ending which really makes you think.

"Screen_Blitz","8","1","3","17 June 2016"," Martin Scorsese's tale of revenge and corruption comes with a grip
","From some of Martin Scorsese's crime classics over the past three decades, we have a seen the gritty and violent portrayal of life as a mobster thirsty for drugs and rank up the gangster ladder. This historical set piece however, sets the gangster genre in a whole another world that very few have seen before. This crime-drama takes us back to the Civil War-era when the South ran rampant with slavery and the North was left coping in mass corruption and crime. This soon lead to southerners rebelling against the Union that tried keeping slavery occupied while President Abraham Lincoln fought to abolish. This Martin Scorsese picture tells a grueling story of revenge and corruption in a gritty historical representation of New York, while tackling the gangster genre on an epic scale. Taking place in 1846 in the Five Points district of New York, young Irish immigrant Amsterdam (played by Leonardo Dicaprio) witnesses the cold-blooded murder of his father Priest Vallon (played by Liam Neeson) by the hands of Bill The Butcher (played by Danial Day- Lewis) who opposes the entrance of Irish immigrants in New York. Sixteen years pass, Amsterdam returns to the Five Points district where crime has ran rampant, riots run amok, and the town run by Bill The Butcher. There he meets an old acquaintance Johnny (played by Henry Thomas) who just so happens to work for Bill as well as pickpocket thief Jenny Everdeane (played by Cameron Diaz) who he develops a relationship with, while seeking revenge for his father's murder. <br/><br/>Compared to Martin Scorsese's other works on his resume, this film doesn't reach the depth that makes it thoroughly compelling. Nonetheless, it is a captivating journey brought together by Jay Cocks' ambitious screenplay and the substance of Scorsese's direction. The beginning scene featuring the massive gang fight between the American natives and the Irish not only sets the story on an intelligent start but also offers one of the most pulse- pounding imagery ever put in a historical piece. The entire scene is exuberantly shot with powerful cinematography. With shots showing victims stabbed, sliced, and beaten with clubs and cleavers; it does get quite bloody and disconcerting to watch, but there is no denying the scene falls nothing of brilliance. The more ambitious aspect aside is the portrayal of the life in New York during the 1800s. The moody costume design, the flashy historical set design, and scenes featuring violent riots sum up to provide a deeply authentic representation of New York's nightmarish society during the Civil War-era. The narrative on the other hand, is where the film meets it's faults. Though the plot stand solid, there are a few places that lack substance. The romance between Leonardo Dicaprio and Cameron Diaz is not what I say terrible or cheesy but feels a little out of place. Overall, the film overcomes these flaws with a captivating plot dealing on the 'good versus evil' story between Amsterdam and Bill The Butcher. The conflict between the two is, at both a physical and emotional level, rollicking from when they first meet eyes to the powerful climatic battle towards the end. Thanks to the performances by Leonardo Dicarprio and Daniel Day-Lewis, these leads simply soar; though Lewis serves as the biggest show stealer here with his tyrannical portray of the corrupt main antagonist. The performance he gives so arresting, it's quite scary.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is an ambitious and fascinating revenge tale by Martin Scorsese featuring some supremely memorable performances by a talented cast. While this isn't Scorsese's most compelling picture, it is definitely memorable. Yes, there is plenty of violence and bloodshed to experience, but it only showcases a realistic portrayal of New York during one of America's harshest periods in history."

","I had heard a lot about this movie so I decided to give it a view and sadly it didn't worked on me, The only thing I liked the most in this movie is undoubtedly Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting played by Daniel Day- Lewis Oh My God !! he was amazing, his acting was amazing, the first half of the movie he plays as good bad guy but it was the other half that he really shows how bad it can be, he was in his role all the time and he's the only reason I'm giving it a 6.<br/><br/>To me the movie is quite confusing and historically incorrect I know that this is some kind of historical-fiction type of movie but in either way I didn't found it convincing and also the time period of the movie is unnecessarily long. I was bored to death in some parts. So if you love Daniel Day-Lewis then definitely watch this otherwise not a good choice to watch."

","Martin Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"" takes us back to the 1860s in New York City to show gang rule, driven by greed and prejudice against immigrants, particularly the Irish. The film stars Daniel Day-Lewis, Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, Jim Broadbent, John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, and Liam Neeson.<br/><br/>Into the corrupt world of the Five Points comes the adult Amsterdam Vallon (DiCaprio), who as a child witnessed his father Priest Vallon (Neeson) murdered by Bill the Butcher (Day-Lewis) who detests the Irish. Amsterdam infiltrates Bill the Butcher's organization, with the idea of killing the Butcher when the time is right.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is impressive, and that's putting it mildly. The scope of it is so enormous, it makes ""Gone with the Wind"" look like a small independent film. Scorcese and his actors have captured the 1860s atmosphere - the locations, the filth, the conditions, the brutality, the costumes, the language - to complete perfection. This is all set amidst the background of Tamany Hall and thousands of immigrants in search of a better life coming off of ships, only to have things thrown at them, while the young men are conned into becoming soldiers.<br/><br/>The acting ranges from great to good. Daniel Day-Lewis is terrifying as The Butcher. Every scene in which he appears is tension-filled, because you as a viewer have no clue what he's going to do - stay calm or cut somebody to pieces. A madman. A brilliant performance. Leonardo DiCaprio as a young man who has to stifle his horrible anger is excellent. Cameron Diaz is effective but not as strong as she perhaps could have been as a pickpocket who falls for Amsterdam but has a history with the Butcher. One has to give her credit for continually stretching her talent in different projects. Here, she's in the presence of giants, so if she doesn't come off as well, it's to be expected.<br/><br/>Get ready for a lot of blood and gore. Not my kind of thing, but it's worth sitting through it for this amazing film."
"singe_101","10","1","3","22 September 2009"," Excellent and resonant
","Within the first few minutes this epic builds up great tension. The proud Irish take a serious battle march with music that still sticks in my head. Their battle royale with obstinate natives does not disappoint, and is actually more brutal than the civil war battles in most movies dedicated to the mid-1800s.<br/><br/>For the film, it was very well done. I had the Blu-Ray and the quality looked fine to me, apparently it was not a good transfer. Daniel Day Lewis is a savant, DiCaprio holds his own, Neeson maximizes his short time and Jim Broadbent playing Boss Tweed is tremendous. The set has to be one the best ever and the extras show that. The ending was a good twist on what was expected earlier in the movie.<br/><br/>For the general content, the rough melting pot is old New York, and a libertarian experiment, perhaps dream. I won't belabor it but the actual police are ignored or beaten and the gangs police down to blatant discrimination. Taxes are privatized, fire squads are fueled by theft and pride, and hookers are seemingly everywhere."
"kdavidbushnell","10","1","3","25 July 2009"," Truly amazing film. One of the Best
","It is simply one of the best films in the past couple decades. Some of the history is not completely accurate, but sure enough PLENTY of it is. What isn't accurate is tedious things that actually make the film better, and more entertaining. Someone stated:""There was also no firing by offshore naval vessels."" I have heard there actually was, and if not they did attack at that time. So once again it makes for great filming and entertainment. All performances are on point, Especially D D Lewis. He should have one the Oscar with out a doubt. He makes the film so great and plays the character like no actor living of dead could. The plot and story are just amazing, absolutely thoroughly entertaining. The time period and history of New York at the time is awesomely interesting. The art direction is phenomenal, and of course the directing is nothing less than brilliant. One of my favorite films ever! One of the best films ever in my opinion, it's up there with Apocalypse Now and Cool Hand Luke. What a beautiful, phenomenal work of art! Just watch for yourself, you will agree it's nothing short of amazing."
"n-mo","6","1","3","2 December 2007"," Quality gets MPD
","Gangs of New York suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder in terms of its quality. We have, on the one hand, the masterful talent of Martin Scorcese, Daniel Day-Lewis and (though he is drastically underused here) Liam Neeson, a setting in the dynamic and brilliantly reconstructed New York City of the mid-nineteenth century, the themes of Civil War Draft Riots and a rapidly expanding and industrializing country attempting to cope with sudden and massive expansion and waves of European immigration. For anyone who has lived in the northeast and whose forefathers crossed through Ellis Island, there is nothing more we could ask for.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, we also have the sometimes talented but dreadfully miscast Leonardo DiCaprio aping an awful Irish accent across a horrifically made up Cameron Diaz (whose accent is equally awful). In spite of the great visual recreations, the film tacitly ignores some important historical points, and not merely by bending dates and character traits: the idea that Irish or other poor European immigrants would have associated with Chinese (almost non-existent in the Manhattan of the day) or blacks is downright laughable. The great climactic action scene is rather dry, nuanced, and thoughtlessly executed. In fact, the film's action takes place only at a few checkpoints throughout, and meantime we are forced to sit through two and a half hours of incomprehensible intrigue and completely unsympathetic characters.<br/><br/>And yet, to add further confusion, we are told that internal disputes had forced Scorcese to make ""damaging"" cuts to the release version of this film, and that fans have been clamoring for him to release an even more painfully dragged-out director's cut (a request which he has firmly resisted). So in the end, Gangs of New York is a very pretty and awful mess, much like the actual city of New York must have been in the 1860's. Scorcese's nostalgia for the old New York City is one I fully sympathize with, but this nostalgia hardly suffices to cement a solid film."
"starinthesky","10","1","3","5 June 2006"," Mean streets of New York
","Gangs of New York was the best film released in Ireland in 2003 and a film that makes me proud to be Irish. The film opens with a stunning set-piece in a snowscape in New York's Five Points in which the Natives, led by Daniel Day-Lewis, overpower the immigrants, known as the Dead Rabbits. The film follows the quest for revenge of the son of a slain immigrant <br/><br/>The story is set in the era of the arrival of floods of Irish immigrants escaping the Famine in their native land. <br/><br/>The film goes on to take in the Draft Riots during the American Civil War and, on a great canvas, Martin Scorsese paints an unforgettable portrait of the foundational years of the city of New York and sets us straight on what life was like on the mean streets of New York in those years. <br/><br/>This is film-making at its greatest and Scorsese's superb direction is complemented by the sinister cinematography of Michael Ballhaus. The best shot of the film is when Leonardo Di Caprio's character discards his Bible, tossing it off the bridge and we have a close-up shot of the Bible crashing onto the river surface, displacing its own weight in water. <br/><br/>Scorsese's sense of yearning for something lost in his own city comes across. The concluding time travels shots of the New York skyscape, shots so full of heartbreak and lost eras. Shots so evocative of lives and loves past in the world's greatest city. New York, New York - one hell of a town. The Twin Towers feature in these closing shots and stand in this worthy film as a lasting tribute and monument to the courage of the people of New York on that fateful September day."

Portraying young Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) looking to take revenge on crime boss Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) in 1863 New York, the movie shows what a historical epic should be. I can't believe that this didn't win a single Oscar; what does Scorsese have to do to win their respect? But the point is that ""Gangs of New York"" is a masterpiece. Scorsese showed the same flair for historical epics that he later brought to ""The Aviator"". Fine support from Cameron Diaz, John C.

","Martin Scorcese is one of the most known and loved directors in the business, responsible for masterpieces such as ""Goodfellas"", ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Raging Bull"", he will always be remembered as one of the truly great. Unfortunately Scorcese's career and movie making has turned stagnant and ""Gangs of New York"" is proof of that.<br/><br/>First off, there's the actors. Leo DiCaprio is very pale in his role and looks somewhat distant, Diaz is unfortunately not very good either, Daniel Day-Lewis however plays off a remarkable performance as the bad guy.<br/><br/>Second, the pacing is slow and plodding. The first half of the movie was so slow and boring, mainly because of boring acting, that I had to watch it three times before I got through it, luckily the second half is better, not because acting improves but because more things happen.<br/><br/>Overall the story is neither very engaging, most because you don't feel anything for Di Caprio's character, Amsterdam.<br/><br/>Overall, Scorcese's ""Gangs of New York"" is a tired effort.<br/><br/>5/10"
"tfrizzell","Null","1","3","25 March 2003"," There Is a Pain in My Heart That the Passing Years Will Never Heal.
","Easily the best film of 2002 in spite of the Academy's ignorance and the views of some movie-goers that do not always completely understand the importance and relevance of many great movies that transcend the world's greatest medium of communication. ""Gangs of New York"" is one of the best and most important productions the cinema has ever produced. It is New York 1846 and a small band of Irish immigrants led by holy man Liam Neeson try to take on the heartless and violent white Anglo-Saxons of the Five Points area led by the dark and deranged Daniel Day-Lewis (in an Oscar-nominated role). Valiant and determined, the Irish give a good fight but cannot overcome a stronger gang that has greater numbers. Fast-forward 16 years and Neeson's son (Leonardo DiCaprio) is back to the scene of his father's untimely death and vows revenge, regardless of the cost. Things have changed a bit though as former supporter John C. Reilly has become a Day-Lewis disciple that hands out unlawful justice as a city cop. Crooked politician Jim Broadbent runs the Tammany Hall Era with the everlasting fear of Day-Lewis and his seemingly innumerable group of thugs. Also Neeson's former friend (Brendan Gleeson) is along for the ride, but his motives are difficult to figure out at first. DiCaprio comes back into contact with childhood friend Henry Thomas (of ""E.T."" fame) and quickly falls for beautiful pick-pocket Cameron Diaz (in her greatest role by a mile). Naturally Diaz has the looks of an angel, but a tarnished soul as she is little more than a thief to other New Yorkers and a glorified lover to Day-Lewis. DiCaprio's plan is to kill Day-Lewis and create a new destiny for the city, but killing the man means that he must gain his confidence and then strike at the most surprising of times. While all this goes on, immigrants come in by the boatloads and are immediately sent to fight in this country's Civil War. Twists and turns occur and in the end the infamous 1863 Draft Riots are the only logical conclusion for the city and all the people within the area's vast landscape. ""Gangs of New York"" is strong in every department. The film's amazing costume design, cinematography, landmark art direction and engrossing story puts the production into an area that very few movies ever experience. The catalyst is of course Martin Scorsese (Oscar-nominated in direction) who combined the finest elements of seemingly every other film he has ever worked on and added intense methods from directors like Stanley Kubrick, Steven Spielberg, Alfred Hitchcock and the greats of the Italian cinema like Federico Fellini. The scope of the film is epic and yet very precise at the same time. All the performances are landmark from top to bottom with there being a few dozen speaking parts. Day-Lewis dominates above everyone as he becomes one of the silver screen's most interesting characters. He is a villain (one of the most frightening ever), but yet there is a depth to him that makes him strangely sympathetic and understandable. The spirits of the DiCaprio character and the Day-Lewis character share an odd bond of hate, but mutual respect and even a father-son type of love. The film's hot soundtrack has an ominous tone and U2's amazing ""The Hands That Built America"" (which was also Oscar-nominated) may be the finest song to ever go with a major motion picture (it does for ""Gangs of New York"" what ""My Heart Will Go On"" did for ""Titanic"" in 1997). I want to make it clear that ""Chicago"" is a fine film, but it is not in the cinematic galaxy of ""Gangs of New York"". ""Gangs of New York""'s 10 nominations and zero Oscar wins is probably the greatest tragedy throughout the Academy's history. With that said, ""Gangs of New York"" will join the likes of films like ""Citizen Kane"", ""Giant"", ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Raging Bull"" (also directed by Scorsese), ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Traffic"" as being landmark events that were too smart, sleek and sophisticated for the eyes of the Academy. In short films like ""Gangs of New York"" make the Oscars become exactly what they are: trivial and unnecessary. The evolution of New York and the appearance of the Twin Towers at the end is a fitting, poignant and emotional tribute to a great city and an appropriate finale to an outstanding film. 5 stars out of 5."

","Perhaps expectations can be raised too high before seeing a film that leaves the viewer feeling cheating.  Gangs in New York came with high praise and loads of expectation but I found the critics wrong and my expectations left at the ticket counter.<br/><br/>The acting was wonderful and we are quickly reminded of the star power behind Leo and Daniel. Their ability to deliver and take second stage to allow Diaz to truly shine made the 2 1/2 hour movie worth my time but little more.  Martin's script doesn't ever find its mark and spends too much time trying to develop a plot that is simply not believable. We muddle through Leo's character never really feeling his pain or understanding his complex motives. When we finally reach what should be the climax, a secondary plot reveals itself and steals what would have been an acceptable and richly sought after ending.<br/><br/>While I normally write longer and more detail reviews, I am careful not to reveal spoilers and will therefore leave my above comments brief and to the point.  I rated this movie a '5' - begin average and nothing more."

No one seems to have a home. No one ever sits down at a table to eat.  Nearly every scene looks like it's set in a local whore house, one for immigrant Irish, another for Chinese. And in this toxic never-never land, even if you're shot through the chest like Billy the Butcher (Day-Lewis), you can still enjoy two bare-breasted babes without having the doc tend to your wound.  And the noise is relentless -- the ha-has, the boasting, the threats, the punches, the sweat -- it's all a relentless, mean -- and corny -- brouhaha.<br/><br/>I can't give any spoilers here, because I didn't stay to see how it all turned out.

","This is a passable, mostly uninspired epic. Technical aspects are what one expect for this type of film. The problem for me, was an apparent lack of sustained passion, given the subject matter. The casting was adequate; Daniel Day-Lewis gave a good performance, in what was probably the movie's best role. DiCaprio was proficient, but lacked the spark of personality and passion, to fully make his performance shine. <br/><br/>The story is interesting, but I don't think it merited such epic treatment, especially with Martin Scorsese at the helm. I kept flashing on 'Once Upon A Time In America', 'The Godfather', 'Doctor Zhivago', 'Lawrence of Arabia'; and wondered why Martin Scorsese did not pay closer attention to these epic masterpieces. The DiCaprio-Cameron Diaz romance could have been totally deleted, and it would have helped the movie.<br/><br/>This movie seems to be more of a calculated 'box-office' effort, than an attempt to present a forthright story; with all the stark, rough edged brutality needed, to do justice to its title. I give this film a low rating, because Martin Scorsese is a very accomplished director; gifted in presenting stripped down and personal films. This is his second failure at epic film making. Gangs of New York, should have been less grandiose and more personal, in its approach. 5/10."

","Martin Scorsese has a bit of a tendency to do gangster films and crime thrillers but there's no denying how good he is at them I mean just look at The Departed, Goodfellas and The Gangs of New York. In case you hadn't already seen I adore this movie, one of the reasons for that is its setting I love the 1800s as a time period for movies because everything just looks as impressive to us now as it did to people back then. The period just makes things look dirty and its characters so hard working. The characters are one of the best things about this movie particularly its villain Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting played masterfully by Daniel Day-Lewis in one of the best performance of his career he just so plays the racist, sexist, insane cruel man so well I hated him while still being unimaginably entertained every time he was on screen. Leonardo DiCaprio is great in this movie even if it could be argued that it's not one of his better performances but still great as his motivations are very clear and and he really is inspiring as a leader. This movie is superbly directed by Scorsese as always as there are plenty of tracking shots and close ups even during the action scenes. The ending of this movie at first might seem a bit underwhelming but the more you think about it the more you realise it is perfect for what it needed to be the social events that are being built in the movie all explode onto the screen and portrays the New York draft riots perfectly as there is death and destruction all over the screen and seeing most of the characters we have grown attached to throughout the movie lie dead in the street as the protagonists weep over their bodies.

","This was a film that given the right cast could have been rather impressive. It didn't, so it wasn't. In short, the film suffers from the presence of Mr.DiCaprio, a man so utterly devoid of acting abilities that he should be prohibited from ever starring in anything again. He stumbles through the film looking less like a man and more like a delinquent paper boy. The script is fairly self-righteous and just a bit too dull in my opinion, making Gangs of New York one to miss. The much hyped battle scenes are also a tad pedestrian and really should have been much more violent and gritty. Somebody like Robert De Niro or Al Pacino could have taken this film and made it their own, but by having such a poor leading man this is not one of cinema's best offerings, far from it in fact!

","When I hear people talk about how America is the greatest country in the world, which is increasingly common from all political standpoints as we approach the 2004 election, it has always struck me how staggeringly wrong that statement is (at least since I traveled in Europe and learned firsthand about other countries). I'm sure I've already angered plenty of the few Americans who may read this review, so I should clarify. America really is a great country, I've lived here for my entire life and plan to live here for the rest of it, but it is simply not the greatest country in the world. That is, in fact, the summation in a single sentence of the common arrogance for which so much of the rest of the world looks at us with disdain.<br/><br/>America is not the greatest, but A GREAT country, in a world with MANY OTHER great countries.<br/><br/>Martin Scorsese, in keeping with his expanding collection of startlingly realistic gangster movies, has taken the best step that he could possibly have taken at this point in his career, in my opinion. He has gone into the 19th Century to make a film about the origins of the very genre that he knows so well to finally make a film that he had wanted to make for more than two decades. The first thing that struck me about Gangs of New York was the stunningly impressive re-creation of mid-19th Century New York. You can almost smell the horses and dirty people, the gunpowder, the wide-eyed immigrants as they step out of the immigration ship and onto the military to go out and fight for 'their country.' The film immediately makes a harsh criticism of the American tendency toward military violence. Immigrants are shown one document that makes them citizens and another that enlists them in the army, and they are armed and sent to war before they even understand what is happening. <br/><br/>The issue of gangs comes up in regards to America as a nation as well as the gangs rivaling each other within the cities. Many people compare current American military action as all too similar to the reaction of an inner city gang  You hit me, we hit you  and Scorsese shows that this is not new at all, it used to be even a desired impression. At one point a character notes, 'True Americans call themselves a gang, but all they do is stand around damning England.' Odd that England should now be our #1 ally in a massively controversial war.<br/><br/>It's important to note that the movie is not entirely about the gangs of New York, but sort of a gang mentality that seems to have been disturbingly prevalent since the earliest days of the nation. Criminal gangs run the streets, corrupt politicians meet in smoky rooms to create laws and regulations that make them huge amounts of money and are promptly ignored by the common people, and the government itself bullies immigrants and the poor into the military. Enlist in the military and you go off to fight for a country that you don't even know and only have begun to belong to, but you get paid. Don't enlist, and they'll draft you, and if you get drafted you get no pay. Needless to say, the draft didn't have a lot of fans.<br/><br/>That's a serious gamble for someone to take when facing such a monumental struggle as entering another country and hoping to scrape out a living at the same time. It's like playing the lottery with your life. It is indeed an unsettling scene to see bewildered immigrants boarding a ship as coffins are unloaded above them. Although for natives and immigrants alike, a mere $300, a massive amount of money at the time, could buy your 'freedom' from military service. This is another thing that has not changed much to this day. And notice what happens when the poor are forced into military service and the rich buy their way out! Riots!!<br/><br/>There are surprising things brought up in the film as well, such as the widespread disgust at Lincoln's having freed the slaves, which today stands as one of the great moments in American history, but the greatest thing that the movie does is show the roots of much of today's unrest in America. The gangs run rampant in the streets, unhindered by such trivialities as the police forces, which are too busy fighting each other to perform much enforcement of the law. Even fire departments fight each other. As is noted early on in the film, New York was not a city, it was more like a furnace.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on the life of Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), whose father, Priest Vallon, played by Liam Neeson, is killed in a gangland massacre at the start of the film. The respect that gangsters had for each other is shown when Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting, the rival gangster (and a staggering performance by Daniel Day-Lewis), protects his body from the post-mortem assaults of his men, asks that his son gets a good education, and even keeps a portrait of him until almost two decades later when he and Amsterdam's fates bring them together again. <br/><br/>Cutting is quickly established as a vicious and cruel gangster, but whose chinks are ultimately exposed, although very subtly, because as his largest weapon, like so many dictators today, is fear. He relies on committing fearsome acts in order to preserve the order of things, to keep people afraid and therefore keep himself in a position of power. The knife-throwing scene, for example, is VERY good. <br/><br/>It's interesting to see the young New York split by gangs at every level of society, each side claiming their own territory, each side praying to the same God, convinced that God is on their side. At the end of the film there is a heavy lesson to be learned. Vallon and Cutting find themselves laying side-by-side in the street, each badly wounded, and even Cutting, the malicious fear-monger, looks around at the chaos in the street, seemingly shamed to see what he had helped create. 'Friend or foe, didn't make no difference now.' <br/><br/>It really makes you think about living your life by the way of the gun when the gravestones start to show up at the end of the film, and then the skyscrapers show up around those. Vallon and Cutting had each created positions of power and influence in New York, but after their violence erupted and destroyed their spheres of influence, 'they build the city back up, and for the rest of time, it's like no one ever knew we was here.'"

","I was working at the cinema when Scorsese's epic period film Gangs of New York came out in 2002, and the first time I watched it, I was blown away. From the visceral opening battle, to the brutal finale, I loved every minute of the film. Scorsese has never been shy about violence on screen. After all, this is the director who gave us the brutal gang murders in Goodfellas and the torture scene in Casino. <br/><br/>I had never read Herbert Asbury's book about 19th century gangs in New York City, nor did I know about this obscure period of New York history. Focusing on the saloon halls, gambling dens and winding alleys of the Bowery and the Five Points district of Lower Manhattan, the book evokes the destitution and violence of a turbulent era. This film made me want to know so much more about the people, the battles, the politics and the blood-soaked tribal warfare. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio, in his first collaboration with Scorsese, is unfortunately the weakest part of the film. It's not that he's bad, and I do not agree that his accent is shaky, it's just that he was still reasonably green in his career. The supporting cast is a very strong ensemble of great character actors like Brendan Gleeson, John C. Reilly and Jim Broadbent. Daniel Day-Lewis, well known for his method action and complete immersion in his roles, gives the greatest performance of his career as the brutal gang leader Bill the Butcher. When Bill yells at Liam Neeson's Priest Vallon ""Then may the Christian Lord guide my hand against your Roman Popery!"", I was gripped to the screen, watching the warring clans hacking and stabbing until the snow is stained red. <br/><br/>I would love to see the original 4 hour cut of the film, before it was whittled down to it's current length, and that's a rare thing for me to want a longer film. Michael Ballhaus's cinematography is amazing, and Howard Shore's rousing score is incredible. The best film of 2002 (The Academy award winner, Chicago, is overrated rubbish). Gangs of New York is my favorite film of the decade. Highly recommended."

The groundwork for this unoriginal revenge pic is laid out in the 10 minutes, and yet the viewer must suffer through 2 hours of predictable verbal and physical battle to finally witness the inevitable conclusion? Like Jurassic Park, when the hype over the film's particpants and special effects is stripped away, you are left without an original and engaging story.

The movie LOOKS great, or at least authentic.  But the plot meanders, the situations are contrived, at best, and the only actor able to rise above the muck to leave an impression is the inimitable Daniel Day-Lewis, returning to the big screen for the first time in half a decade.

","Overall I would have to rate this movie as a disappointment. It's extremely violent and chaotic; thoroughly unlikeable for the most part, with a series of characters who don't really seem to have many redeeming qualities. At almost three hours, it's extremely long (particularly for a movie that didn't really seem to have much of a point until the last few minutes.) Sure, there were issues - ethnic rivalries, political corruption, family vengeance - but it just didn't seem to be going anywhere. Performances were OK, but no one particularly caught my eye with an outstanding performance. Cameron Diaz (as Jenny) was woefully underused, and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Amsterdam) has yet to prove (in my opinion anyway) that his wonderful performance in ""Titanic"" was anything more than a fluke. The best performance in the movie was probably Daniel Day-Lewis's turn as ""the Butcher."" Having said all that, the last few minutes of the movie did help bring things together and established (in my view) a purpose for the movie, and certainly left me and others who I heard commenting on it with a haunting image.<br/><br/>**SPOILER AHEAD**<br/><br/>Nothing much had been making sense, until the last few scenes, which were really nothing more than a series of shots of the New York skyline at various points in history. The last shot, of course, was a haunting image of the Twin Towers, which helped me make sense of the movie. It's a classic ""the more things change, the more they stay the same"" message. New York in the 1860's: ethnic rivalries, suspicion of immigrants and violence, all with the spectre of war (the Civil War, and the New York City draft riots) hanging behind. Sound familiar? This is how it strikes me anyway, and it struck me enough to raise my estimation of the movie's value. I still didn't care for it. For the most part I found it a rather dull and uninteresting three hours, but Martin Scorsese did get my attention at the end with that Twin Towers shot and he did get me thinking about the movie. When you leave a movie that you really didn't care for still thinking about it - well, that has to be a success of some sorts.<br/><br/>4/10 (about 2 points higher than I was going to rate it before I actually thought about it.)"

","Gangs engage in turf war in 1860s New York. This is yet another example of Scorsese's disturbing obsession with violence. The film starts and ends with ludicrous battle scenes. In between there are some good moments but there is too much padding, needlessly extending the running time to nearly three hours. It's obvious from the outset how it's going to end, but the narrative meanders and is often over-the-top. The gritty atmosphere of mid 19th century New York is well captured, but the director's depiction of 19th century New York was more impressive in ""The Age of Innocence,"" also featuring Day-Lewis. Here Day-Lewis chews the scenery as a ruthless butcher. DiCaprio looks intense."

"TxMike","Null","1","6","31 January 2004"," Superb fictional but historically-valid account of gang warfare that shaped New York city in the 19th century.
","Feb 2010 edit: I saw it again presently and it still is a fascinating movie. A must-see.<br/><br/>'Gangs of New York' is a long movie at 2 hours and 45 minutes, but it never did feel 'long', it never got boring. As the historical featurette on the DVD shows, the time, place, characters and events are predominantly real, New York in the period between about 1840 and 1865 was the dirtiest and most dangerous place in the USA, perhaps in the whole world. The five points area, near what is now Little Italy and Chinatown, drew immigrants, primarily Irish, and freshly-released convicts. Police were there mainly to keep the wealthy from getting mugged by the poor. Rival volunteer firefighter groups would often fight each other and loot the burning buildings. There really was a 'Boss Tweed' and a 'Bill the Butcher.' Young female pickpockets thrived. There were a whole host of rival gangs, and being part of a gang was essential for survival. The riots protesting the draft really did result in almost destroying New York.<br/><br/>So, what we have in this movie is a very closely historical look and feel of that era, interwoven with a fictional story. The clear star of the movie is Daniel Day-Lewis as 'Bill the Butcher'. He creates an unforgettable character that is eloquent, sometimes funny, always terrifying, and often deadly to his opponents. Leonardo DiCaprio is very strong as the young man 'Amsterdam' whose father (Liam Neeson) had been killed years earlier in the gang brawl that opens the movie. Cameron Diaz plays Jenny who has connections to both Bill and Amsterdam. The picture and sound on the DVD are first-rate, with either a Dolby 5.1 or a DTS 5.1 sound track selectable. The movie is long, so the only extra I watched was the historical one, and it is a treasure. I like this movie and rate it highly. Anyone who wants to learn more about the 'hidden' history of New York should see this movie.<br/><br/>The remaining comments contain SPOILERS and are for my future recollection. Do not read further. If you want more details, go read the critic Ebert's excellent review.<br/><br/>Bill was the vicious leader of the 'Nativist' gang that wanted to keep out the foreign immigrants, especially the Irish who they considered even lower than the black former slaves. The rival gang featured here were the 'Dead Rabbits'. (As the DVD extra explains, the real Irish name was different, but sounded much like 'dead rabbit', and actually had a meaning close to 'large and dangerous brute'.) In the opening fight Bill kills 'Priest', Amsterdam's father, the fight ends as the Nativists prevail. Amsterdam is sent to an orphanage to grow up, then we see him 16 years later being released, he goes back to Five Points. <br/><br/>Being a quiet but assertive and competent type, Amsterdam soon gets into the good graces of Bill. Voice-over, 'It is strange being under the wing of a dragon. It is warmer than you think.' But eventually Bill learns who Amsterdam really is, and is prepared when he deflects a knife thrown by Amsterdam, subdues him, spares his life but brands him on the right cheek with a glowing hot knife blade. Jenny the pickpocket and Amsterdam were on the way to falling in love, she helps nurse him back to health, he assumes leadership of the Dead Rabbits, he challenges Bill to a brawl, which takes place right when the militia begin to fire upon that section of town using cannons on ships in the harbor, to break up the military draft protest riots. Bill gets mortally wounded, Amsterdam finishes him off. His revenge taken."

"mido505","3","1","6","2 January 2003"," Scorcese's Satyricon
","Do the people who describe Martin Scorcese as our greatest living filmmaker ever actually watch his movies? Perhaps his fans are hoping that, since he has been making essentially the same movie for the last two decades, one of these days he is bound to get it right. Scorsese had 30 years, and 100 million dollars of Harvey Weinstein's money to show the world what he is really capable of, to produce his masterpiece, the one to cement his reputation and put him into the pantheon next to Griffith and Welles, et al., and what do we get - an overblown Freudian psychodrama that says more about Scorsese's Oedipal confusion than it does about New York City's so-called history. What shocks me about Gangs of New York is not that it is the same Scorcese crap, but that it is so technically inept. At least Goodfellas, The Age of Innocence, Kundun, Last Temptation of Christ, and Casino (my favorite version of the never ending Scorcese project) had some stylistic razzed-dazzle to distract from the unpleasant characters, mind-numbing violence (did we really need to see those bones scraped in Gangs of Tibet; did Jesus really have to pull his heart out in Gangs of the Holy Land?), and cynical, mean-spirited world view that constitute the Scorcese universe. In Gangs, we get flabby, brownish cinematography from Michael Ballhaus; overbuilt, artificial-looking sets from Dante Ferretti; and clunky, choppy, inept editing from Thelma Schoonmaker. All the extras look Italian, the CGI stinks, and the costuming is ridiculous. Not for a second in this 3 hour clunker of a so-called docudrama did I believe that I was seeing real people in a real place enacting real events. This movie says nothing about the birth of a great city and everything about the death of a great director. At least Federico Fellini had the courage of his own florid romanticism when he made Satyricon, his eye-popping, defiantly ahistorical dream of history. Scorcese has been irrelevant as a director since The King of Comedy bombed. In Scorcese's best movies (Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, King), the psychotic loser achieved some sort of redemption in the end. Now the redemption is gone and only the violence remains. This is the lesson that life has taught one of our most revered filmmakers? How sad. <br/><br/>This movie is about one thing and one thing only: Bill the Butcher. Despite what the reviews might say, despite what Scorsese might say, Bill the Butcher is not the villain of the piece; he is the hero. The movie is a celebration of his life, and a lament at his passing. He is huge, a titan, a warrior, a god, both feared and revered by the puny underlings who surround him. As the last of his kind, and a man who can only measure his worth in battle, he is saddened that, after the death of Villon, no other warrior is worthy of his mettle. (WARNING SPOILERS) One sees, in his treatment of Villon's son, Amsterdam, (which really makes no logical sense: he should kill the boy in order to prevent a future threat, and should have killed him at the theater), Bill's fervent hope that he will once again meet a great adversary. The fact that Scorsese's sympathies lie with Bill, and not with Amsterdam, is shown in the films strange, murky climax. Just as the two men are to meet in battle, the city explodes around them. Bill is finally brought down, not by Amsterdam, but by the forces of history that conspire to destroy his world. Bill lets Amsterdam finish him off, because he knows that he no longer has any place to go. The triumph of the weak has led to the substitution of politics for combat. The meek have inherited the earth.<br/><br/>This is Scorsese's proto-fascist vision, rooted in a longing for an all-powerful father/protector, which he has been promulgating since Taxi Driver, where the psychotic, Mohawk sporting Travis Bickle finds redemption when he defeats Harvey Keitel's Apache pimp. The inarticulate Travis, who is being driven slowly insane by the cesspool of modernity, and whose first target is, appropriately enough, a politician, becomes a man when he becomes a warrior, whose true worth is forged in purifying violence. So why is Taxi Driver a masterpiece and GONY an unparalleled stinker? After all, the animating vision is the same in both. Unfortunately, in GONY, Scorsese catastrophically misunderstands his talent. Scorsese's best films are intense, focused examinations of character. They are compact, tight, vivid portrayals of this monstrous vision that has haunted his psyche since he was a young asthmatic staring admiringly out the window at the neighborhood toughs. Scorsese has no real feeling for history or for narrative. His settings are dreamlike, symbolic spaces that externalize the main character's point of view. In short, he is the antithesis of the epic filmmaker. That is why GONY crumbles around the figure of Bill the Butcher. It's as if Tennessee Williams had tried to shoot Ben Hur."

","I think I counted that there were about 4 moments in this film that I would class as being mildly exciting. That's 4 exciting moments in a film that runs for 160 minutes - no wonder I struggled making it to the end.<br/><br/>In Gangs of New York, Amsterdam's father Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) is killed during a fight by Bill The Butchers (Daniel Day-Lewis) during a gang related fight. The film then skips on 16 years and Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo Di Caprio)is back in New York and befriends Bill The Butcher with the intention of killing Bill The Butcher for killing his father - in essence it's a revenge film.<br/><br/>What I couldn't understand was why the writers chose for Amsterdam to befriend Bill The Butcher and wait for an opportunity to kill him. What was the point? Why not just play it as a straight revenge film? Bill The Butcher didn't know who Amsterdam was when he returned because Amsterdam was only a child when he last saw him therefore Amsterdam always had the upper hand over Bill. I would have forgiven this glaring lapse in logic if the film would have at least been entertaining, suspenseful or interesting, but it isn't. It's as dull as dishwater quite frankly.<br/><br/>Amsterdam ends up romantically linked with Jenny (Cameron Diaz) which was not only ludicrous, but also downright boring. In fact, I didn't give a hoot about any of the characters and I could feel my interest waning the further the film plodded along.<br/><br/>Scorsese is a master craftsman when it comes to directing and it shows here, but if I'm being cynical one could argue that maybe it's too good. There are long panning and tracking shots which are great to look at, but a lot of these shots and many of the scenes went on for too long and seem to add to the film's already elongated running time.<br/><br/>Picking up on more trivial aspects, I thought Leonardo Di Caprio's attempt at an Irish accent was awful (which may explain why most of the time he didn't even bother trying to speak in an Irish accent). Cameron Diaz was guilty of forgetting that her character was meant to be Irish at times, but her Irish accent was at least reasonably good when she remembered to use it. I also thought, to her credit, that she gave a much better performance than I was expecting - even though her character wasn't particularly well-written.<br/><br/>One thing that is great about this film is Day-Lewis; Day-Lewis is a bit of a perfectionist and takes his acting very seriously. He's well-known for immersing himself into a character and the work and time that he puts into doing this is clearly evident. I noted in the Trivia section that he talked in a New York accent throughout the entire time during the film's production. It clearly shows as I never once believed that he wasn't a New York native, even though he is English. I haven't always appreciated all of Day-Lewis' films, but I've always had the utmost respect for him as an actor.<br/><br/>Even the film's climax is rather predictable (although it did at least add a bit of much needed excitement). My thoughts on this when it finished was that it was an over-long, bloated, unconvincing bore of a film where the only good thing about it was Daniel Day-Lewis."

"jboothmillard","6","2","28","15 November 2005"," Gangs of New York
","From Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated director Martin Scorsese, this period crime drama is a very stylised film and quite riveting. The film starts with citizens of New York, led by William 'Bill The Butcher' Cutting (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Daniel Day-Lewis), fighting a small war against the Irish immigrants, led by Priest Vallon (a brief Liam Neeson), who is killed by Cutting during the battle. Sixteen years later, his son Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio) has returned to New York to avenge his father's death, after learning how to fight. He manages to weave his way into Bill's gang, and becomes a trusted assistant, he also finds himself falling for the girl who Bill used to be involved with, beautiful street-smart thief Jenny Everdeane (Golden Globe nominated Cameron Diaz). Of course, before Amsterdam is able to get to killing Bill, his true identity is exposed, but don't worry, he gets back to him eventually, and he gets revenge during another big battle. Also starring Jim Broadbent as William 'Boss' Tweed, John C. Reilly as Happy Jack, E.T.'s Henry Thomas as Johnny Sirocco, Brendan Gleeson as Walter 'Monk' McGinn, Mean Machine's David Hemmings as Mr. Schermerhorn and Tim Pigott-Smith as Calvinist Minister. Scorsese does do well directing, DiCaprio doesn't exactly get to express himself that much, but he proves a good actor after the hype of Titanic, and Day-Lewis as the intoxicating 'Butcher' is unmissable. The film is bloody and brutal, the costumes are quite innovative for the 1860's, and it is accompanied by great music, including the closing song by U2, ""The Hands That Built America"", I can see though why the critics re-rated it from four stars to a respectable three out of five, it isn't exactly amazing in terms of storyline, but it certainly isn't rubbish. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Song for U2's ""The Hands That Built America"" (but it won the Golden Globe), Best Sound, Best Writing, Original Screenplay and Best Picture, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Howard Shore, Best Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, Daniel Day-Lewis number 85, and Cameron Diaz number 65 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Broadbent was number 23, and Day-Lewis number 20 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Day-Lewis was number 9 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 15 on The World's Greatest Actor.

","""Gangs of New York"" is an American movie from 2002, so 17 years old now already and actually a pretty long film at not too much under 3 hours. And while not only with its running time, but also with its subject and story this film is probably among the closest we can consider historic epics from the new millennium. It feels a bit surprising how many people have really forgotten about this movie. The reason may be, that the big names here, namely director Scorsese and the two lead actors Day-Lewis and DiCaprio have films (more than one really) in their bodies of work that are considered more memorable and relevant. Also it probably did not help the movie that it was nominated for no less than 10 Oscars and came short in every category. The story is by Jay Cocks, a longtime collaborator with Scorsese and the two other writers who helped him with the script are Oscar winners on other projects. But even besides the two leads, the film has a lot to offer cast-wise. Cameron Diaz managed a Golden Globe nomination and her work here around the age of 30 was probably the closest she ever came to an Oscar nomination, and maybe ever will come. She is pretty stunning here no denying. Jim Broadbent can be relied on as always, even if he for once plays a not really likable character, but more of an opportunist. Brendan Gleeson was actually really amazing and should have been nominated for an Oscar in the supporting category. It's shameful he is now almost 20 years later still without a nomination. Gary Lewis most people will know from Billy Elliot, he is also somewhat memorable. Liam Neeson plays a character with little screentime, but a lot of significance. Eddie Marsan is nice for me to see as always, but he does not have one word of dialogue and is also only seen twice or three times being an assistant to Broadbent's character. John C. Reilly did not do too much for me here compared to other films. Henry Thomas I don't really know much about.<br/><br/>The most memorable performance comes from Daniel Day-Lewis of course playing a character who shows major similarities at times (not just the beard) to his perhaps career-defining portrayal of Daniel Plainview from around five years later. His turn here is really raw, intense and physical, but also emotional sometimes. We find out about his connection with Diaz' character, he sort of sees a son in DiCaprio's character before disappointment strikes and he speaks with utmost respect about Neeson's despite how much he despises his creed. I can see why he won a BAFTA and an SAG Award, even if he lost at the Oscars. People said it would be him or Nicholson winning eventually, but Brody managed to sneak in and he sure is not unworthy either. At its very core, this film is a story about revenge as we have a young man returning to his home after 15 years to avenge the murder of his father at the hands of a local butcher. And as he gets in contact with the influential leader, he gets closer to him and the older man almost becomes something like a mentor to him. But of course, it does not stay friendship. Jealousy brings his motivations to light and he will have to pay a bloody revenge. Eventually, the film is also about politics as young Vallon manages to put up a candidate to win an election over Cutting, but the element of bloodshed is still always there from beginning to end and it is alwas obvious that death is the only way to end the feud. However, at the same time race struggles escalate in New York, so official forces intervene on many occasions and their approach is just as bloody as the one by the racists. It's a bit tough to explain and maybe also historically not exactly what most people are interested in, which could hurt the film a bit because many people care more about the Lincoln years before that that are referenced, but not elaborated on in detail.<br/><br/>I was lucky enough to watch this film on the big screen and I recommend everybody to do the same and not watch it on a small screen. It's just way better this way, which already becomes obvious during the memorable fight sequence early on. This movie was shown on the occasion of a New York themed film marathon that spanned over a month and it sure was a good choice, not just because the city is mentioned in the title and because it is a good movie, but especially because there is also historic relevance related to New York in here. A lot. The best example is really when we see the grave(s) at the very end and how the skyline changes moving forward hundreds of years in time. So good pick. I very much enjoyed this film. There were some great moments without a doubt, but all in all I would say it is ""only"" a good movie. It sure flew by despite its running time and there are virtually no lengths in here. You can see that Scorsese is a master of his craft, even if most people who think about his body of work won't immediately think about the really amazing job he did here. Also visually, costumes, special effects, sets etc. this movie is highly impressive. So it is audibly. I did quite enjoy the occasional inclusions of local Irish music, so much indeed that I put two songs on my mp3-player afterwards (New York Girls, Unconstant Lover). So who would I recommend this film in particular to? Of course mostly fans of Day-Lewis, Di Caprio (and Gleeson) too should watch it I think. Maybe New Yorkers in particular too, especially if they have an Irish background to understand how their own fought for their liberties back in the day. People who like historic movies in general or period pieces I am not sure if that alone is enough to be safe to like this one. Scorsese completionists of course. I also think this is a movie, that is equally interesting to females and males, maybe slightly more for the latter, but I generally do not like categorizing films to be more appropriate to or relevant for one gender. So just watch it, don't be scared by the massive running time. I believe this is a truly rewarding watch overall and I was definitely closer to calling this a great film, then a mediocre, let alone weak film. Don't miss out."

","The movie started out slow, but got better as it went along. The setting in the Civil War period was a key component of the plot and context of this movie as well. The period when the north was instituting a draft caused a motive for the antagonist and conflicts for several characters. This was also a period when there was high immigration from Ireland. This movie really helped to illustrate these components, from the blatant racism and xenophobia to the internal conflicts about the draft. While the movie itself was hard to follow due to the jumping of scenes, its depiction of a key point in the Civil War helps to make the details memorable."

The love hate relationship between Amsterdam and Jenny helped further establish their characters and the inner conflict they possessed within themselves.

"mark.waltz","7","0","2","26 July 2017"," They all thought that they were fighting in the name of God.
","I don't think that you're supposed to like anybody in this epic story of civil war era New York City where hatred because of different Christian faiths shows the hypocrisy of an evil time. It was the era of slavery, the time where brother fought brother, where corruption was king, and survival meant getting what somebody else owned. In a sense, it was as bad, or possibly worse, than life in the old country, all in the name of religion and keeping the unwanted out, or at least down. The issues of the draft leads to the riots as men able to buy their way out find free blacks taking their jobs for less money, revealing even more hatred and leading to really inhumane treatment of the newly free that has shaped racial views across the country today. This all makes me wonder if supposedly educated, civilized men were really barbarians in expensive suits.<br/><br/>There has been much written and documented about New York City history, and a spectacular PBS documentary goes into detail about rial hatred as New York became the megacity of a country not yet at its centennial. It starts decades before the civil war with a nasty fight between Irish immigrants (the ""dead rabbits"" gang) and American born brutes (simply called the Native Americans) where a young Irish boy witnesses the brutal slaying of his father (Liam Neeson) in battle and years later (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) returns for revenge against the killer (Daniel Day Lewis). DiCaprio has been institutionalized for over a decade, and his seething anger hides behind a seemingly calm but determined demeanor. DiCaprio manages to worm his way into Lewis's circle, becoming one of his few confidantes, only awaiting the moment to strike. A rather nasty streetwalker/petty thief (Cameron Diaz) begins a love/hate relationship with him. While it's nice to see women in this era being portrayed realistically, there's nothing nice about her as she is quite crafty for such a soft looking lass.<br/><br/>While the layout of the city hasn't changed, architecture has, and the Five Points area of downtown Manhattan looks nothing like this now. Real life famous New Yorkers of the time (or infamous in the case of Boss Tweed) appear throughout; The head of Tammany hall who created much of the hatred between the Irish immigrants and the natives is also joined by Horace Greeley (the man honored with a park near 34th and 6th Avenue) and the Schemmerhorn family, and views of their lavish Fifth Avenue homes are seen, both as splendid reminders of an old glamorous midtown now gone and as the subject for violent break-ins that certainly ended up with brutal murders of some of them. <br/><br/>While DiCaprio and Diaz are excellent, it is Lewis who commands most of the attention with his brutish characterization outlined with an earthy charm. The film made me feel like I went back in time over 150 years, and even though there are other other eras of New York history I'd prefer to visit, I'm glad I got to spend nearly three hours in reel time as opposed to real time. As well made as this is, I found it more than just a little repulsive overall, and certainly won't be revisiting this like other modern classics. Technically and historically, it is brilliant, but I cannot praise this as the masterpiece that it's been made out to be.<br/><br/>Violent and disturbing, this does still feel as if it is being somewhat truthful, even though it's a bit too exploitative as far as the sexuality and bloodshed are concerned. There's a few presumed homosexual prostitutes seen among the street whores, dressed in women's clothing, acting rather mincing, yet still showing facial hair, and it's interesting to see a subject of ancient New York history that prior to the 20th century little is known about. I found their being right out in the open rather far-fetched, however, and I wonder the reasons for director Martin Scorsese including such characters in a story that didn't require them. The historical aspect of this era should be documented on film as it has been here, but the rancid atmosphere prevents it from pulling me in completely. Nothing has changed much outside the architecture, automobiles and most unfortunately, technology."

","I really liked how Scorsese focused on the struggles faced by the many Irish immigrants in New York City during the time of the Civil War. While still maintaining to give it a relatable story-line of a boy who seeks revenge for the death of his father. It really helped me understand the conflict between the ""Natives"" and Irishmen living in the area. Although it consisted of intense violence, it really showed the pain and suffering of those who lived and were affected during this time. It may have some historical errors, like the crime rate and living conditions were in the Five Points during that time, but overall it was a very interesting movie that pretty much accurately described the hardships for the Irish during the Civil War."
"oOoBarracuda","7","0","1","18 December 2016"," Gangs of New York
","Visually stunning, if not oddly cast, Marin Scorsese directed Gangs of New York in 2002. Weaving the tale of the development of an area of New York known as the Five Points, all the while following a man seeks revenge for the murder of his father. Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cameron Diaz, Gangs of New York tells the darker tale of the origins of the country during the Civil War. Perhaps one of Scorsese's most visually striking vivid films, Gangs of New York was nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 2002, cementing Scorsese's iconic reputation as a director.<br/><br/>Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio), as a child, witnesses his father, 'Priest' Vallon's (Liam Neeson) death in a gruesome battle with a rival gang member, Bill 'The Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis). After avoiding a life of living under Bill's supervision, Amsterdam makes it his life's mission to exact revenge on the man who killed his father. In 1863, Amsterdam returns to The Five Points which is being run by The Butcher and his gang, many members of which used to belong to The Priest's gang. Life in The Five Points is hellish for anyone who isn't a member of The Butcher's gang. They run the state like it's their own, are blatantly anti-immigration, womanizing, and exceptionally violent. The forced conscription brought about by the Civil War brought with it the most turbulent of times for the fledgling state of New York, and the entire country itself. Riots break out in the street protesting the corruption in government and the violence used to rule the citizens. The violence acts as a perfect backdrop, keeping The Butcher just distracted enough for Amsterdam to exact revenge for the murder of his father.<br/><br/>The filming of the opening battle scene was a stroke of brilliance by director Martin Scorsese, complete with his signature God's eye view overhead shots. Leonardo DiCaprio, despite being a stock actor of Scorsese's, seemed ill-fit for the role of a son seeking revenge. He lacked the deep-seeded revenge angle needed for the role in place of the overly facial pretty boy he is so constantly lauded for playing. Cameron Diaz is completely miscast in the role, of the love interest, never coming off as fitting in the period. Daniel Day-Lewis gives a wonderful performance, as always, brilliantly capturing the violent, yet philosophizing gang leader. Scorsese delivered his most visually stunning film to date with his 2002 feature, Gangs of New York."
"C22Man","7","0","2","3 March 2016"," How Daniel Day-Lewis can push a film to Greatness
","Gangs of New York has arguably the most mixed legacy of any film directed by Martin Scorsese. The premise is an intriguing one, a battle over the 5 points in NY between those of the mainland and Irish immigrants set in the 1860's. Whilst many people love its scope and authenticity, many have a strong distaste for its weak characterisations and messy dialogue. I'd say I'm in the former category though I can certainly see the films varied faults. As well as those things, what really makes the film work is assured directing by Scorsese and simply an incredible performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.<br/><br/>The story smartly weaves together a large scale battle, a revenge tale and real-life historical events (including the NY City Draft Riots). Scorsese is great at telling these kind of hard edged stories and considering how much is being told it really is excellently crafted, nothing feels forced and it all fits together rather seamlessly. The real focus is where it should be on the personal tale of revenge as Amsterdam Vallon gains the trust of crime boss William ''The Butcher'' Cutting, who he intends to kill for murdering his father. It is relatively simple but given the other ideas that the film is trying to bring in and its massive scope, this 'small' main story makes a nice anchor for the film as a whole. It does have slow parts and it does meander at times for little reason, but never to the point where the main focus is lost. <br/><br/>I actually really enjoyed how the historical aspects were used in the film and they never felt forced or contrived just to suit the plot. Everything that happened felt like it made perfect sense. There is a genuine tension to the film that makes everything taking place seem more important and there was a real sense of conflict between the two warring factions. Scorsese directs with his usual finesse. He knows how to give you the action up close and make the dialogue appear interesting which is useful give some of the stodgy lines dotted around. The production values are very high and the sets all look extremely authentic, with clear care taken to create such detail. Howard Shore's score was also nicely melodic and held many memorable compositions.<br/><br/>The action is as brutal as you would expect it to be. It is very gritty and dirty, while Scorsese shoots it all expertly by placing us within the battle sequences instead of watching it from afar. The opening battle in the snow is especially vivid and beautiful to look at. I will say though that the climax is somewhat messy. Considering the films intensity and the constant tension between the two main characters, the pay-off is a little underwhelming as they just have a small fight then that's it.<br/><br/>On to the best feature, Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher. This performance is superb from beginning to end and it's almost impossible to take your eyes off him when he is on screen, this is one of the most interesting characters in modern cinema. Day-Lewis does it all he makes Bill menacing, humorous, aggressive, at times downright terrifying and all with a distinct accent. Yet at the same time many of his ramblings actual have a point and you kind of begrudgingly respect him for never backing down. It is a role that dominates the screen wonderfully and Day-Lewis was certainly robbed of an Oscar for it. Leonardo Dicaprio (in his first of many team ups with Scorsese) is just okay as Amsterdam. He is believable and captures the conflicted nature, but the character simply isn't fleshed out all that well and to be fair that is because he isn't written especially well. His accent wanders too much as well, he can't decide whether he's a New Yorker or if he's Irish. Cameron Diaz isn't as bad as you'd expect, but she doesn't leave much of an impression and her role is sort of bland as a result. Of the rest of the cast Brendan Gleeson and John C. Reilly show up irregularly but with little to do, however Jim Broadbent makes for a fun Boss Tweed.<br/><br/>Despite its issues I do have a soft spot for Gangs of New York. Most of that comes from the way this story is told and how Scorsese handles it, keeping the focus on its main plot while allowing us to see the bigger picture and the impressive authenticity in creating the atmosphere of the time. That said Day-Lewis is the real star here with a performance that really drives the film forward and manages to go in every direction without becoming unfocused, with Bill the Butcher rightly becoming a famed modern cinematic character as a result of that. It certainly isn't among Scorsese's best work and there are a variety of minor flaws that do threaten to drag the film down, but I think the things it is good at are things that is extremely good at and its a film that remains gripping despite its sheer size."

","Martin Scorcese has wanted to make the Gangs of New York for several decades. Elaborate sets were built at the Cinecitta studios in Rome for this Dickensian yarn and Scorcese spent many months editing this film down to a manageable length as well as smoothing out the violence at the behest of the censors.<br/><br/>In 1846, the noble Irish Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson in an all too brief role) leader of the immigrant gang the Dead Rabbits goes to battle with the xenophobic protestants, the Natives led by the vicious Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) who plays him like murderous Bill Sikes crossed with the more bluff and charming Fagin.<br/><br/>Vallon is slain by Butcher's blade. His son escapes and grows up angry and intent on revenge and calls himself Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio in almost Oliver Twist mode.) Many years later after reform school Amsterdam returns to the Five Points and plots to get close to Bill in order to kill him but thinks get a lot complicated.<br/><br/>Bill Cutting has risen in power, he holds sway with various corrupt politicians and lawmen. Bill has dreams of his new America and it does not include it being a melting plot. Amsterdam worms himself into the Bill's inner circle and almost becomes a surrogate son to him. Amsterdam also takes the pickpocket Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz who might as well be Nancy) who was once Bill's mistress.<br/><br/>However despite the cruel and nasty things Bill has done and his expertise with the blade, Bill is not a caricatured villain and Day- Lewis makes him empathetic and Amsterdam finds respect for him. Just hope that Bill never finds out who Amsterdam really is.<br/><br/>Scorcese wanted to make a film about the rise of New York. We know this because the final shot dissolves from the ruins of a riot ridden city to that of skyscrapers in the beginning of the new millennium. The story mixes a revenge tale with the insertion of real life characters to acknowledge a city that is going to advance rapidly from the nineteenth century slums with low life characters.<br/><br/>In making this epic which took three screenwriters the focus is on Day-Lewis making his character complex and dominating leaving other characters more vacuous and the film out of balance. Priest Vallon is interesting but is dispatched too quickly.<br/><br/>It is a big performance from Day-Lewis but I once read that if you examine it closely, it is almost as if he is doing a Robert De Niro impression. An observation with some substance.<br/><br/>The film is long but it is not an epic. The broad strokes of a young city growing up entwined with a young man growing to take revenge is lost in the finer details with uneven pacing and too many sketchy characters."

Also, there is a lot of historically inaccurate information in this movie. One of the most obvious is the character played by Cameron Diaz. Diaz's character, a pick pocketing hooker during the times of the 1800's would never look or stay as clean as she is with a near perfect set of teeth. The performance by Daniel Day Lewis was extraordinary. He was captivating throughout the film. His emotion from start to finish could be felt the entire time.

I'm a foreigner to USA, if you couldn't already guess it.<br/><br/>Now with all this said, I do can understand if certain people don't agree with this movie, due to its somewhat modern style. But if your expecting your average history lesson with everything set exactly as it was back then, then you've chosen your movie poorly. This movie gives you history in a way that etches itself into your subconscious, if not the historical teachings then at least the feeling of the time that you were presented to. It does it all, and does it really, really well, even if it is somewhat unorthodox.<br/><br/>So as a conclusion, this movie is a masterpiece, all in all, and must see for everyone who's come of age (and I really do mean this, DON'T see this one if you're underage) and can stand movies with explicit material, because it has a lot of it. It will make you sick, make you cry, leave you marked for years to come with an experience of awe, tragic but ultimately touching perfection - if not going all the way, but what does - that will stay with you for years to come. Anyway, it receives a clear 10 out of 10 from me, and it raises the bar for the respect I have for director Martin Scorsese. It's the third movie of his making that I've watched, and let me just finish with saying: he has yet to disappoint me."

","Martin Scorsese has delivered classics all through his prolific career & 'Gangs of New York' is amongst his most accomplished works. A Compelling Watch! <br/><br/>'Gangs of New York' Synopsis: In 1863, Amsterdam Vallon returns to the Five Points area of New York City seeking revenge against Bill the Butcher, his father's killer.<br/><br/>'Gangs of New York' is gruesome & disturbing, its certainly not for the faint-hearted. Scorsese's unforgiving direction is raw & real. He executes a vendetta story with aggression & fierce mentality. He handles the violent portions, distinctively. Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian & Kenneth Lonergan's Screenplay is brutal but extremely arresting. Cinematography by Michael Ballhaus is eye-catching. Art Design is magnificent. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: The Greatest Living Actor, Daniel Day-Lewis plays Bill the Butcher, superbly. He plays the loathsome villain to the fullest, delivering each line & each move with magnetic ease. Leonardo DiCaprio as Amsterdam Vallon, the vengeful protagonist, is utterly good. Cameron Diaz as Jenny Everdeane, delivers a career-best-turn. Jim Broadbent as William M. Tweed & Brendan Gleeson as Walter ""Monk"" McGinn, are terrific. John C. Reilly & Liam Neeson shine in cameos.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Gangs of New York' is winning cinema."
"neil-476","8","0","1","24 July 2012"," Powerful and evocative
","Martin Scorsese's period piece, telling of street warfare between differing immigrant factions in the mid-19th century, is long, violent, and features some excellent performances, notably the always intense Daniel Day-Lewis as Butcher Bill (it was good to see Cameron Diaz playing in something completely unfrothy, but I felt that Leonardo DiCaprio was a little too lightweight as protagonist and the audience's eyes).<br/><br/>More than anything, though, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and feel of this movie. It captured a sense of place and time really well. I obviously can't say how accurate it was, but I was more than happy to accept it completely as somewhere and somewhen with which I was completely unfamiliar, and a very real location for the events of this film."

","The streets unveil in the year 1846 in Five Points Manhattan. The Native Americans led by Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis) go head to head with the immigrant communities led by Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) of the Dead Rabbit Gang. Priest Vallon is butchered at the hands of the butcher (Pardon the Pun) driving all those led by the priest into the streets of Five Points whilst victory lay at the hands of the native Americans. Scorsese does not waste time and leaps forward 16 years and right to the year of the New York City Draft Riots in 1863. Priest Vallons son Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns back to Five Points to avenge his fathers' death. Amsterdam returns only to find out that Bill is now the largest crime boss of the Five Points and is also a very influential personality in the corrupt New York political arena.<br/><br/>2 times Oscar winner Daniel Day Lewis is phenomenal to watch. There isn't a moment where Lewis loses his character. Nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor Daniel Day Lewis lost to Adrian Brody (Brodys Performance was absolutely the more deserved one) at the 75th annual academy awards. Whilst Leonardo DiCaprio is one of Martin Scorsese's common go to actors (much like Robert DeNiro from the 70s & 80s) he is not able to hold a candle to Lewis's performance. DiCaprio in his own is magical and does not falter however he does seem to be too fragile to step into Liam Neesons shoes!<br/><br/>GANGS OF NEWYORK which was shot entirely offshore. Filmed in Cinecitta Rome; the home of Italian cinema the set of the movie is indeed the real deal. Recreating New York of the 1800's indeed is a challenging task. What I like about Scorsese is that he has true passion of the movies he makes. Whilst the set of the movie could have easily been done entirely on CGI (the technology did exist at the time; Ridley Scott used it in Gladiator) Scorsese stuck to the basics and went completely old school. Initially set to be made in 1978 Scorsese could not see this through since the studios were reluctant to invest on such a great scale movie at the time. 24 years later he still made the movie and that says a lot about the man and also why the movie is such an entertaining extravaganza. <br/><br/>Inspired by the nonfiction book The Gangs of New York by Herbert Asbury the historical motion picture GANGS OF NEWYORK starring Leonardo DiCaprio & Daniel Day Lewis is an outright all time success. Whilst the argument of, if it will or will not be considered a classic with time to come is yet unresolved this super production by Martin Scorsese is a must watch. Engrossed with values of history of the American Streets and its inception and the story behind what is considered to be the greatest city on earth GANGS OF NEWYORK is indeed a Blu Ray worth owning if you are fan of the genre; History.<br/><br/>167 minutes of tyranny, treachery, malice and vehemence is GANGS OF NEWYORK in a nutshell. The fact that the screenplay is inspired based on historical events makes it even more submissive to the audience. Whilst I am no New Yorker and if you the reader are a New Yorker, the battle fought and the journey travelled since 1863 is indeed a memory to be proud of and theme Scorsese is not missing at any minute. The movie is about the people who built New York and Martin Scorsese could not have said it better.<br/><br/>TITLE: GANGS OF NEWYORK DIRECTED BY: MARTINS SCORSESE STARRING:LEONARDO DICAPRIO, DANIEL DAY-LEWIS, CAMERON DIAZ, BRENDAN GLEESON, JIM BROADBEN, JOHN.C.REILLY, HENRY THOMAS & LIAM NEESON RATED:R RATING:08/10 167 MINUTES ."

"mnpollio","5","0","1","17 June 2011"," Scorsese's ""dream"" project is surprisingly insubstantial
","Purportedly director Martin Scorsese spent decades shepherding this dream project to the silver screen. When the production finally started, his ardent fans declared that the film would finally win him a long elusive Oscar and take its place as one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. Sadly, reality has a habit of intervening.<br/><br/>Set in the latter 1800s, the film depicts the corruption, violence and conflicts between rival street gangs in the Five Points area of New York City. The film opens with a particular conflict between the Nativists, led by Daniel Day-Lewis' Bill the Butcher, and the Dead Rabbits, led in a glorified cameo by Liam Neeson's Priest Vallon. Vallon's murder by the Butcher is witnessed by his young son Amsterdam, who returns years later and unrecognizable in the guise of Leonardo DiCaprio, who is hellbent to have his revenge. This typical tale of revenge is set against the backdrop of political corruption culminating in the Draft Riots of 1863. <br/><br/>Arguably the most surprising thing about the production is that, given its nearly 30-year gestation period, the screenplay still comes off as unfinished and aimless. The drama unfolding in the background often seems far more fascinating than what Scorsese decides to focus on, with the main revenge drama especially predictable and clichéd, populated by characters that fail to engage either our sympathy or (with only one exception) grab our attention. <br/><br/>It is a given that DiCaprio will infiltrate Day-Lewis' gang with the old nutshell of saving him from an assassination. We know this will be followed up by Day-Lewis developing a fondness for him that DiCaprio finds himself reluctantly reciprocating, which calls his whole plan into question. We also know that DiCaprio will face constant jeopardy of exposure and that there will be one Judas in the mix. Scorsese also throws in a token love interest in the form of dirtied-up, yet still comely pickpocket Cameron Diaz, who seems to have wandered in off the set of Oliver Twist.<br/><br/>The film ever so briefly touches on the injustice of immigrants arriving to America only to be conscripted immediately into the Union Army upon disembarking the ships – a plot thread far more interesting than anything else Scorsese spends time on. There is some attempt to depict the political corruption of the time with a glad-handing Jim Broadbent as the infamous Boss Tweed, a subplot that Scorsese handles clumsily at best. <br/><br/>A ridiculous amount of time is spent on an election wherein DiCaprio convinces Brendan Gleeson, a man who showed him kindness on the death of his father, to campaign for office in the hopes of quelling the gang violence. The film ostensibly argues that Gleeson is a stellar pick because he is a relatively honest man from the streets, who knows the parties in question and has the courage to stand up for the people. Unfortunately, this time-consuming subplot culminates in a laughable sequence wherein after having won the election Gleeson goes to privately talk reason to Day-Lewis, who casually assassinates the man. Apparently this is supposed to be a shocking scene, but Gleeson heretofore was such a minor character and it seems inconceivable that someone as knowledgeable of the parties and their acts as the screenplay insists Gleeson is would go alone and unarmed into Day-Lewis' lair to lecture him and not see this outcome. When one reflects on how much time is lavished on this dead end subplot, it seems inconceivably wrong-headed. And if anyone can make heads or tails out of what is going on with the Draft Riots at the end, you are doing well.<br/><br/>Additionally, the film contains a jaw-dropping instance of incongruity. At one point, Day-Lewis tortures DiCaprio and then brands his face with a large poker. This incident nearly kills the character, but yet a few scenes later, DiCaprio's face appears largely unmarred. Ahh, the joys of being a leading man.<br/><br/>Broadbent, Gleeson, Neeson and Henry Thomas are all wasted. While both DiCaprio and Diaz are fine, neither are able to break out of their clichéd roles. We are never given any reason why Diaz's character takes an immediate shine to DiCaprio other than that he is the lead and she is the romantic interest. The only one to make a strong impression is Day-Lewis, and I don't mean that in a good way. Duded-up in 1860s fashions, swaggering about like a peacock, and twirling his hysterically villainous mustache, Day-Lewis has the tendency to remind one of an over-the-top Oilcan Harry/Snidely Whiplash clone. This performance would be perfect for The Perils of Penelope Pitstop, but not a deadly earnest Martin Scorsese drama.<br/><br/>The final shots depicting the growth of NYC seem to suggest that we have just witnessed events of such profound impact that they influenced the very future of NYC. Yet we walk away from this film feeling none of that. Instead, it often seems that while Day-Lewis and company are holding court center stage, the most interesting develops are taking place on stage left."

"Quicksand","5","0","1","5 August 2010"," An Absolute Mess
","There's over 1000 comments on the film a this point, so I can't say I have anything new to add or any new point to argue. The characters are exceptionally weak, and the screenplay reeks of a vanity project written by committee.<br/><br/>After watching ""The Deer Hunter"" for the first time a few months back, I was looking through criticism for that film, and recall one critic of the time saying that given too much money and time, it is entirely possible for a filmmaker to become so self-important that he could literally climb up his own ass.<br/><br/>More accurately, in her review of ""The Deer Hunter,"" Pauline Kael spoke thusly: ""(It is) a small minded film with greatness in it... with an enraptured view of common life... (but) enraging, because, despite its ambitiousness and scale, it has no more moral intelligence than the Eastwood action pictures."" The consensus of that film, released around the same time ""Gangs"" was conceived, was ""Its (The Deer Hunter) greatness is blunted by its length and one-sided point of view, but the film's weaknesses are overpowered by Michael Cimino's sympathetic direction and a series of heartbreaking performances from Robert De Niro, Meryl Streep, and Christopher Walken.""<br/><br/>""Gangs of New York"" is precisely all of these, except without the great acting performances. Daniel Day-Lewis goes beyond superb and achieves something even greater, but the film around him is so ambling and weak (despite spectacular production-design), that there's still no reason to watch it. A different filmmaker made the far more wise decision of letting Day-Lewis chew scenery as a lead and not as a supporting player, and that entire film was lauded with praise and positive reviews it richly deserved. ""Gangs"" deserves none of these.<br/><br/>DiCaprio, though still a commanding presence, remains a weak actor without an ear for accents, as in this film he is only occasionally Irish. He feels it is his job to simply arrive on set and glower (or cry), and Scorsese is content to let him. The film is weaker for it, despite grand performances from every supporting actor, including Cameron Diaz. There is no shortage of attractive blondes in Hollywood, but even in 2002 she was aware she'd better put something on screen besides her piercing blue eyes, and shockingly, she does... despite the incredibly meager material. She is charming and damaged all at once, from the first time we see her until about 80 minutes into the film... the instant her character has sex with the hero, she becomes a glorified extra.<br/><br/>The entire film is similarly rambling, with no direction or clear plot. We're vaguely aware our hero wants to kill the man who killed his father, but he is given the chance several times and does nothing. In voice-over, we are told, ""You don't kill a King alone in the dark, but in front of the entire Court,"" but of numerous chances given, some of them are indeed quite public. None are taken, as Amsterdams reasons for not doing so exist only in Scorsese's head, and not anywhere on screen.<br/><br/>Scorsese must have known this was a mess, because he pushed back the films original release date by a year, in order to keep working on it (something unheard of, and a concession that could only be made to a director of his reputation). He's made three more films with DiCaprio since then, and ""The Departed"" is easily the best of them, though by no means even in the Top Five for Scorsese's once-storied career.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of DiCaprio's strong presence, or weak acting, or his toned abdominal muscles, there are other films from not just Scorsese but other directors as well. If you are a fan of Day-Lewis' chameleonic transformations, there can be no other option but ""There Will Be Blood."" If you are a fan of violent history lessons, the 21st century has given us The History Channel.<br/><br/>The IMDb trivia section says Scorsese wanted to make this film in the early 1980s, but the failure of Heaven's Gate (Michael Cimino's follow-up to ""The Deer Hunter"") caused studios to shy away from making big-budget, expensive historical dramas. Miramax should have done the same in the early 2000s, because there's nothing great about this film, and the only reason it got made is not because of any perceived greatness of Scorsese... he got here simply by outlasting all the rest. Maybe he's a little less Amsterdam, and a little more Bill, after all... in which case we should thank him for his past services, and hit him with something heavy if he keeps trying to make any more movies.<br/><br/>5/10, would not recommend to anyone, not even fans of Scorsese's."

Daniel Day-Lewis acts up a storm and is certainly something to see as Bill ""The Butcher,"" the vicious leader of one of the film's eponymous gangs.

Cameron Diaz, meanwhile, shouldn't be let within 100 feet of a period piece.<br/><br/>The film's period look is detailed and authentic -- there's an awful lot of mud in those 19th Century New York streets.

","The movie that I have seen recently is GANGS OF NEW YORK. It was made in 2001, and the main characters are Leonard Dicaprio, Cameron Diaz. The movie's story is about New York in 1846. This movie is a kind of historical drama.<br/><br/>In 1846 New York, there are a lot of Irish people live as emigrant laborers in a slum named five points. Then native American people hate the Irish people. There is an antagonism between both of them.

Amesterdam come back to five points 15 years later. He want to take vengeance on the leader...<br/><br/>This movie tells us one of the American historical realities. The plot follows the original history, and the directing is great. Especially, the screen set is amazing. On the other hand, there are many violent scenes that I couldn't see. Those should be less.

I love revenge films, but they are only good when the characters strike when the iron is hot. If they don't, the audiences anger towards the villain quickly depletes to nothingness. That is what happened to me with this film. Would you want to watch a revenge film that is 3 hours long? Heck no!(i did not know how long it was going into it). I really can not see why people like this movie, but if i had to guess i would say that it makes patriotic people who love America look like the scum of the earth(in my opinion if you do that you should be shot).Its bad enough we have idiots living in America who hate it, but know are filmmakers are doing it too?

","This is probably the most underrated movie of 2002. I have to admit that certain details of the movie are cheesy, but I still think that it's a good movie. The best thing of course, by far, is Daniel Day Lewis. The interesting thing is that the grittiness makes you speculate about the foundations of the gangs that exist today. Even the recreation of some aspects of the gang wear makes you think about this. The sort of flair, in other words, utilized by some gang members today. That said, there is something definitely eerie about Daniel Day Lewis' performance. I guess you could call it a caricature, but a definitely fascinating one. We can only speculate at the amount of melodramatic style gang members of that day would behave as, but Day Lewis' helps in bringing you into the cartoonish world that must have been. I sort of don't know if DiCaprio resigned himself to be worked around by Day Lewis, or what; but his acting and character still remain at least vaguely interesting (and yet completely eclipsed by Daniel Day Lewis' performance). This movie is good historical fare, and one of Day Lewis' best performances. While it isn't Martin Scorsese's best movie, (I think that Goodfellas takes care of that..) it is definitely a step up above most movies. Completely evocative."
"Hitchcoc","8","0","2","13 October 2009"," Don't Think of It as History
","There is certainly a lot of carnage. There's also a little confusion as to motivation. However if you don't try to look at this as an accurate portrayal of history and treat it as a bit of a fantasy, it plays quite well. We have wonderful adversaries who posture and primp. It was more of a nineteenth century gangster film (a little Godfather thrown in) and a tribal sort of thing with all the ritual and righteousness. Lets face it, it's just a bit much, including the Hollywood ending. It did remind me a bit of the Kurosawa movies where there is not a spot unbloodied ground left after the battle scenes. Daniel Day-Lewis is charismatic. He is the reason I would watch this movie again. He absolutely eats up every scene he's in. DeCaprio is a bit boring to me. What he represents is a lot more than what he does. Never got into him. Nonetheless, it's big and impressive with great cinematography. Did anything really get settled. I don't know."

","Gangs of New York is a film that has many of Martin Scorsese's typical trademark flourishes and is a worthy film to add to his legendary filmography.<br/><br/>The film follows a young Irish immigrant named Amsterdam as he travels through the cutthroat gangs of New York City in 1862, searching for his father's killer, the untouchable, Bill the Butcher.<br/><br/>The themes of revenge and vengeance run rampant throughout the film. Amsterdam wishes to avenge his father's murder. Amsterdam's friend Johnny betrays Amsterdam to the Butcher out of revenge for stealing the girl of his dreams. Even Bill the Butcher's striking down of Priest Valon was an act of revenge after the Priest removed his eye.<br/><br/>The film was superbly directed by the great Martin Scorsese. The production design was stunning, but what impressed me the most was the acting, in particular Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher. Day-Lewis disappeared within this role like he does with nearly every part he's ever played, and he was definitely on top of his game here as the chilling Butcher.<br/><br/>While the film kind of chugs a bit in the middle parts, the beginning and the end form terrific bookends to a highly entertaining, and extremely well-made film.<br/><br/>I give Gangs of New York a 9 out of 10!"

","SPANNING the length of the entire from the very first frame of film right up to the very end, GANGS OF NEW YORK (Initial Entertainment Group/Miramax Films, 2002) bursts onto the screen like a an exploding super nova in the heavens; continuing to apply its vice-like grip to its audience up to the very end. It is a most unusual film, unique beyond belief. It qualifies as a truly singular work of cinematic art; standing alone with none other quite like it.<br/><br/>TO begin with, the meticulous manner in which the sets replicating New York City's Five Points Neighborhood of the late 1840's to the early Civil War 1860's, immediately transports its viewers to this other place in those days long gone. Unlike most other movies viewed, there is none of the ever present, underlying feel of the knowledge that it is all make believe.<br/><br/>CAREFULLY casting the main players, Director Martin Scorsese brings a much larger principal cast than usual. Featured players are divided between those with name recognition (Star Power-if you will), and those 'faces' that make their mark by giving memorable performances in their portrayals of characters passing through the story.<br/><br/>HEADLINING the superb cast are such luminaries as Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, Cameron Diaz and Liam Neeson; being joined by such capable performers as John C. Reilly, Henry Thomas, Cara Seymour, Stephen Graham and Gary Lewis.<br/><br/>MIXING all of this on screen talent with some of the most spectacularly unique and starkly realistic and other worldly sets ever; Director, Mr. Martin Scorsese gave us what one could only describe as a bit of American History that had come alive on the screen.<br/><br/>WE, of course realize that film is not reality and seldom captures real historical happenings. GANGS OF NEW YORK is, alas, a screen play; a make believe story which has been concocted to give its audience a well spent couple of hours.<br/><br/>INASMUCH as it has been said that there is no such thing as strict fiction, we know that real influences from real living people. In the case of this GANGS saga, it is also one of those movies that fall into the category of an Historical Picture; being the cinematic equivalent of the Historical Novel.<br/><br/>HISTORICALLY speaking, Mr. Scorsese's film served us very well on multiple fronts.<br/><br/>FIRST of all, it brought to vivid, life-like on screen realism to the City of New York in the late 1840's through the period of our American Civil War. In order to do so, sets replicating the slums of Five Points and other locations in old New York were constructed in that Italian Movie Studio. <br/><br/>THESE sets were extremely impressive and came with such a price tag, that it has been said that we won't be seeing their likes again; opting for computer generated sets, scenery and backgrounds would prove to be much more of a frugal approach to the creation of spectacular scenes. Our case in point is the Russell Crowe starring vehicle, THE GLADIATOR (DreamWorks/Scott Free/Universal Pictures, 2000), which made use of some spectacular, computer generated imagery.<br/><br/>SECONDLY, the story brought to light a period in our own American History that appears to have little representation in our popular fiction. It was a time of a Native American Political Party, also known by the common moniker of ""The Know Nothing Party."" The 'Know Nothings' had a very simple and uncomplicated, straight forward sort of manifesto. They hated all things immigrant, legal or not. At this time, it was legal immigration that was streaming in from Ireland and the German States and Principalities. <br/><br/>THIS should serve as a good example to all that the people on the bottom rung of the American ladder were not always non-whites; but rather two European, Caucasian Ethnicities, who incidentally now are the two most numerous groups to which Americans trace their descent.<br/><br/>THIRDLY, little is said in most of our Primary and Secondary School's History Books about the New York Draft Riots, which were so vividly and graphically portrayed here. Certainly the total chaos of the riots and the pointless and pitiful death and destruction of property that ensued is at once both disturbing and enlightening in portrayal.<br/><br/>THERE is a particularly intense concentration on the wanton and senseless violence and destruction that is invariably the product of the Mob Mentality. There was one sterling example of the product of such anarchical behaviour. In those riot sequences, the White Immigrant rioters start to attack any and all of the Free Blacks, who they encounter in their destructive, malicious sweep across Manhattan Island; even hanging one of the young Black Guys who was earlier shown to be a member of one of the White Five Points Gangs.<br/><br/>AS a final shock to the viewing audiences was the depiction of the U.S. Naval vessels in their desperate use of cannon fire to bombard rioters. This is a most disturbing sequence in the film; made ever so much more alarming by the cold realization that it was factual.<br/><br/>IN our humble opinion, we believe that Martin Scorsese deserved some more consideration for Oscar with this Film. Although it probably did not do the great traffic at the Box Office that the Studio would have liked, it did much better than an also ran. We believe that time will be very kind to this GANGS OF NEW YORK; declaring it to be in a class with the top films of all time. It is a one of a kind, unique work of Cinematic Art; not unlike CITIZEN KANE, CASABLANCA, THE THIRD MAN and Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS, even! <br/><br/>WE (both me buddy Schultz and Meself) give it as many stars as possible!

"pgear83","10","0","1","25 May 2008"," A Great Lesson in American History
","Gangs of New York marked Martin Scorsese's shift from Italian-American crime films to Irish-American crime films with the story of the beginning of the Irish in America. Waves of Irish immigrants, driven largely by the Irish potato famine of 1845 to 1852, landed in America through much of the middle of that century, including throughout the Civil War (which would be the equivalent of moving to Russia in the 1940s or to Iraq today to find food and work; so Ireland must have been pretty bad at the time).<br/><br/>In one of the greatest performances I've ever seen, Daniel Day-Lewis plays Bill 'the Butcher' Cutting, leader of the so called Nativists, and vehemently opposed to all foreign influence on his country. The character is based loosely on a man named William Poole, who was really more of blow-hard than a rough and tough street fighter and who died long before the 1860s in which the majority of this film is set. The evil nature of this character is ratcheted up several notches by Scorsese and Lewis, with his push broom mustache, glass eye and invented accent (think Jerry Seinfeld if he was always mean and angry and a few octaves lower in voice).<br/><br/>The other notable character is Jim Broadbent's Boss Tweed, leader of the corrupt Tammany Ring that influenced politics in New York well into the 20th Century. The appearance of Broadbent as Tweed is so spot on that you could easily put him in an encyclopedia an few would notice any difference. This man was a model for modern politicians. He says, ""The appearance of the law must be upheld, especially when it's being broken,"" as he employs gangs for muscle work while trying to create the appearance of order.<br/><br/>While Tweed courts the Irish vote, the Butcher and his men throw rocks and harass them as they come off the boats. ""If only I had the guns Mr. Tweed, I'd shoot each and every one of them before they set foot on American soil"" he says. The Butcher is extreme in his actions, though typical in the attitudes behind them. He is the embodiment of American self-righteousness, wrapping himself in the American flag (literally at one point!) and claiming moral superiority on the basis of things his father did. He hates the Irish for their different language and their strange religion (Catholicism). After a failed assassination attempt against him by a Celtic-speaking Irishman, he attempts to get information from the wounded man the only way he knows how, delivering my favorite lines of the film, ""Who's man are you?... You see this knife? I'm going to teach you to speak English with this (expletive) knife!"" If that's not a perfect representation of the modern neo-conservative attitude toward foreigners, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>For brevity's sake I haven't even mentioned the main plot line about Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio)'s revenge plot against the Butcher, but it's almost incidental to the real strengths of the film. Chiefly, these include an honest portrayal of a brutal era of history. We see rival fire brigades fighting each other while houses burn, rigged elections that make modern Florida look like a democracy and the Draft Riots of 1863, (New York's most violent moment until 9/11) For incredibly well crafted sets, great acting throughout and themes that ring true as much today as ever, Gangs of New York makes my top 10 list."

How versatile is this guy anyway? He can play an Indian, a Brit, and an 19th century scoundrel, as well as a handicapped person. I thought the movie itself was very good from a cinematic standpoint but a little slow at times. Unlike some of the reviews, I thought Cameron Diaz did a really good job in this. I was very underwhelmed by Leo DiCaprio's performance. It came off kind of stiff and uninspired. So..to summarize, I think DDL should have gotten at least a best actor recommended for this.

Even though it hat some great parts, that deserve to be recognized, it also hat some doubtful scenes, a few dull characters and a lag of originality. These are hard words to use, considering that the movie was entertaining and hat a lot of brilliant moments, but when these doubtful moments emerge between the good parts, it pretty much takes out the joy of the ride in a very anti-climatic way, that spoils the overall impression of the film. I must admit that I was quite impressed by the acting (especially Daniel Day Lewis' performance), the effects and the very distinguishing Martin Scorsese touches throughout the entire movie. But when it comes down to the overall impression of the film, it made me feel quite disappointed, because of my expectations due to his former works, and at the same time impressed.

In my opinion a superb film. 6 years later Scorsese gathers his cinematic mastery to create another powerful and brutal period gangster drama about New York (of course).<br/><br/>Gangs Of New York is a bloodthirsty film about the struggling, lawless period that was endured while America was being 'born'. Immigrants were registering in Ellis Island and thereafter were unleashed to prosper (or otherwise) in the land of the free.<br/><br/>Scorsese shows us how the already established 'Americans' fiercely despised the Irish settlers. The film's opening scene is brutal, obscene. A bloody battle led by Liam Neeson for the Irish and a sociopath, prejudiced Daniel Day Lewis (who is astonishing) as Bill The Butcher wanting to clear the scum off of the streets of New York; his streets, his corners.<br/><br/>This is a Martin Scorsese film so I don't need to tell you that a) it is violent and b) it is very good. Though it may not apply to everyone, Gangs is a beautifully crafted, directed and acted masterwork from one of the finest and purest directors of the past three decades.<br/><br/>Watch Leonardo Di Caprio's risky journey as he befriends Bill The Butcher in a mission to ultimately avenge his father's death at the Five Points battle.<br/><br/>""A stunning period gangster epic"" <br/><br/>8/10"

The one that really sticks out is Gangs of New York. I'm not going to summarize because most of who reads these posts are people who already have a slight idea to what the movie is about. This movie is absolutely breathtaking. I am still in awe of this movie every time I see it. The cinematography, film editing and of course the acting was amazing. Daniel Day-Lewis gives one of the best performances in the history of cinema IMO. And I definitely think he was robbed at the Oscars. I have also been a big fan of Dicaprio's and he holds his own alongside Day-Lewis. Even Cameron Diaz comes and gives a gripping performance. There's just something about Scorsese that brings out the best in actors and its unbelievable. This movie does an awesome job at taking us back to this point in history and dropping us right in the middle. Some will say this movie is very violent and it is, but the violence never overshadows the movie and you realize that the violence is very necessary and authentic. It also produces one of the most memorable endings to a movie ever, in which you see the rise of NYC from about 1860 till present. That scene alone will forever be envisioned in my mind. This movie was robbed at the Oscars but hopefully it will get the recognition it very much deserves. Not even in the IMDb top 250? come on people! 10/10!!!"

","Five Points: The 19th-Century New York City Neighborhood That Invented Tap Dance, Stole Elections, and Became The World's Most Notorious Slum <br/><br/>Boss Tweed: The appearance of law must be upheld at all times! Especially when it is being broken. <br/><br/>Welcome to the Five Points, New York City's wretched slum along the East River. Across its mean streets battle lines are forming. It's 1836; on one side of the street stands Priest Vallon (the mountebank Liam Neeson) with Celtic Cross in hand; on the other stands William Cutler (Daniel Day Lewis) the local butcher and 'civic leader' of the down and out Nativist faction. Growling and sneering speeches precede the brutal work of the day, the battle for control of the Five Points. <br/><br/>The battle ground is Paradise Park at the heart of The Five Points in lower Manhattan, officially named the Sixth Ward, the ""Bloody Auld Sixth,"" where there was at least one grog shop for every six people. Most immigrant Irish and the poor native neighbors rarely sat in anybody's pew though religion ostensibly was the point of contention between the inhabitants of the ill-light rickety next to slaughter houses, stables and breweries. <br/><br/>In the first battle, the Nativists prove the strongest. The heaviest wave of Irish immigration is yet in the future. Setting the Irish to flight and killing Priest Vallon in the fray, Cutler's henchmen capture the priest's son and commit him to a Protestant orphanage on Blackwell's Island. <br/><br/>The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the Underworld <br/><br/>Bill Cutler as diabolically violent as he is does have an interesting tale to tell as he drapes himself in the American flag. The orphaned son of an American soldier killed in a British massacre Cutler despises the British and their affected American counterparts even more than he hates the Irish. Cutler has many insults for the Irish but his main complaint with them is that they have cheapened the value of American labor. Cutler is the stuff from which Labor leaders in a generation then yet to be born were cut from. <br/><br/>Cutler boasts that he closes his hand on the Five Points like a bloody fists. Democratic politicians kowtow to Cutler: Cutler delivers the votes that keep the venial, corrupt Democrats in power. <br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis slices up an electrifying, overpowering performance in his role as Bill the Butcher Cutler. His manner, accent and handlebar mustache topped by a stove pipe hat capture the lower class New Yorker of his time. <br/><br/>Yet, though grey has not cropped into Cutler's mutton-chop sideburns, time is marching on aging Cutler. Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCapria) is coming of age. Released from custody, Amesterdam tosses the parting gift The Bible in the River as he marches home to the Points. He's out for vengeance but first he serves a stint as Cutler's henchman until his identity is unveiled. The twisted Cutler might have liked have to acknowledged Amsterdam as a son. ""I never had a son,"" says Cutler. A Hollywood ending was not in store. <br/><br/>Leo DiCapria rendered a magnificent performance as the American born son of the Irish priest. DiCapria variance between the New York accent and an affected pseudo-Irish one might have unintentionally caught Amsterdam's difficulty in deciding which side he belonged to. In the end, Amsterdam's decision is made for him when he is pushed out of Cutler's natives after a betrayal by a friend. <br/><br/>A new Argamenon is slated; the opponents face each other across Paradise Square. The final battle is disrupted by a barrage from a ship in the harbor aimed at the draft riot nearby. <br/><br/>This film has all the makings of the great cinematic masterpiece. Camera work recreates the historical setting. The film's touches of multiple overlaying ironies are worthy of a Shakespearian tragedy. The corrupt democrats, the rigged elections, the raging Civil War and the New York uprising against the draft in the backdrop add depth to an understanding of the period."

The direction is near flawless, the sets are terrific, the screenplay is wonderful, and the acting is superb. Daniel Day-Lewis gives the the best performance of the movie as Bill Cutting. He is frightening and he is very real. Leonardo DiCaprio, CAMERON DIAZ, and JOHN C. REILLY also give A-grade performances.<br/><br/>There is little not to like here. I think the movie gets too overwhelming in some parts, and I'm not sure what to make of the DiCaprio-Diaz relationship. The movie is very violent and very bloody, and that will turn away some viewers, but it is important to the story.<br/><br/>This movie clocks in at nearly three hours, but it goes by in a matter of seconds.

Hope to see the whole thing sometime.<br/><br/>I was not able to see this movie when it was new. I can remember wanting to see it for the nerdy, goofy plaid pants and giant top hats of the main male characters. I am interested in historic fashion design.<br/><br/>Bill the Butcher almost comical. Daniel Day-Lewis was very striking with his accent, since this character was nowhere near Day-Lewis' elegant gentleman of ""The Age of Innocence"" or his rustic Hawkeye in ""Last of the Mohicans"".<br/><br/>DiCaprio: Like Day-Lewis, good in historical dramas. For DiCaprio, this movie was made in between ""Titanic"" and ""The Aviator"". I saw them both, and also first saw DiCaprio in ""Romeo and Juliet"". I was thinking how I had seen ""Titanic"" many times, remembering Jack's ending scene where he was being frozen and then slipped beneath the waves soon before Rose was rescued. I feel that DiCaprio really inhabits his characters. I was so amazed that he became Howard Hughes in ""The Aviator"", and in ""Gangs"" he does not disappoint. The cool thing is that Amsterdam is a quick learner, and learns to use Bill the Butcher's instructions to do-in the old buzzard himself, LOL.<br/><br/>I am a History Major at The Ohio State University. I know that the draft riots happened, but did not know that they occurred during the background of this story. I will do research on the draft riots.<br/><br/>Since I didn't see the early part of ""Gangs"", I must have missed where Day-Lewis' and DiCaprio's goofy clothes were untouched by all the blood, gore and destruction of their final battle.

","When you here the name ""Martin Scorsese"" these days, three films come to mind; ""Goodfellas"", ""Raging Bull"", and the relatively new ""The Departed."" However, ""Gangs of New York"" certainly deserves a place on the long list of Scorsese classics. The story has been told a million times in a variety of forms; Two rivals and there gangs try to gain superiority and power over one another. Daniel Day-Lewis's Bill and DiCaprio's Amsterdam are the major players, and New York is the battleground. On the surface, this film is a violent, vulgar, and period-piece-esquire film. However, underneath, there is a really interesting conflicted story of motives, passion, and human nature. This deeper side is brought about by Daniel Day Lewis's intensely powerful and profound portrayal of the ""villainous"" Bill the Butcher."" While Bill is the obvious antagonist of the story and Amsterdam the protagonist, we find that both characters commit villainous acts everyday. They are simply similar men on opposite sides of an ongoing battle. However, it is during this battle, when we begin to see useless side plots, where the movie's weak points shine through. Cameron Diaz, though a fine actress, is the wrong woman for her role. The supporting cast is made up of fine actors who simply don't fit into there roles. Even DiCaprio seems strangely distant and unfocused during the film, and never really connects with the audience. Still, despite its shortcomings, ""Gangs of New York"" is a stunningly picturesque portrayal of gangsters in New York in the mid' 1800s, and will surely be enjoyed by audiences for years to come."

The horror and the poverty of that time and place was conveyed on such a visceral level. The battle scene in particul needs a mention.<br/><br/>The battle in its self is one that is quite different than the LOTR battles often depicted. Rather, we see a chaotic battlefield in which all one can do is slash at anything nearby that moves. The fact that Martian decided to use the techno music, while it might not've added much, it was made very well to fit the mood. Must of all, the sight of the kids watching the battle was something that made me realize how such kids might carry on the cycle of violence.<br/><br/>So much praise has been reaped on Daniel Lewis, so I don't think I can add much. However, I will dutifully acknowledge that watching him chew up the scenery was the high point of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie's length served the movie well, I thought. Even subplots like the election that might not've added much to the movie did help create the mood.<br/><br/>the movie did have a few things the I didn't care for. The whole thing with Bill having a crystal eye was confusing and slightly unrealistic. Diaz's character really only served as a love interest.

With the recent success of his latest direction 'The Departed', Martin Scorsese is one of the greatest director there ever was.<br/><br/>OK, so the plot is simple but elegant. Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) returns to Five Points section to avenge the death of his father 'Priest' Vallon (Liam Neeson) who was slain by Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) sixteen years ago in an all-out territorial war in Five Points between the Native Americans led by Bill The Butcher and the Irish immigrants led by 'Priest' Vallon who calls themselves the ""Dead Rabbits"". Unfortunately they lost. So, it was goodbye to the Irish immigrants and hello to their new local leader Bill The Butcher. Amsterdam, witnessing the death of his father tries to escape, goes underground and hides the knife that took his father's life before he was caught and was taken in a place called ""Hellgate"". Now, 16 years had passed and we see a corrupt, impoverished and an already dying Five Points. All the people there must pay to Bill The Butcher for the pleasures he gives them. A local political sect called the Tammany Hall lead by Boss Tweed can't do nothing against Bill The Butcher's influential and massive power that's griping Five Points.<br/><br/>So, Amsterdam, knowing that he can't match Bill's influence and power that he's got befriends him and Bill in exchange takes him under his wing and thinks of him as his own son. Their bond has gotten stronger when an attempt to kill Bill The Butcher was foiled by Amsterdam only wounding Bill in the shoulder and makes it less-lethal. This makes Amsterdam realize that his plan to kill Bill The Butcher is slowly fading away as his respect and devotion to him grows. But he didn't let the respect and devotion devour him. On one particular celebration, the day the Dead Rabbits died along with 'Priest Vallon, Amsterdam finally plans to kill Bill The Butcher in front of the public while celebrating the death of his honorable father. But, Johnny, a friend of Amsterdam betrays him just because he didn't get the girl of his dreams, Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz) who has fallen in love with Amsterdam. He tells Bill Amsterdam's real identity just before the celebration starts. So, this makes him aware that Amsterdam is trying to kill him that night. So, Amsterdam's plan failed and he was the one that was stabbed in the abdomen. Bill tortures him and left him to die. Thanks to Jenny, who took care of him while he's suffering the wounds that he got courtesy of Bill. When Amsterdam is up and running, he resurrects the name the Dead Rabbit and declares an all-out war to the Native Americans. It didn't go as planned because of the Draft Riots that put New York in a state of calamity. One thing led to another and Amsterdam ended up stabbing Bill The Butcher and eventually killing him.<br/><br/>The cast was great. Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz leads an all-star cast. They portray their respective roles with finesse and excellence. Daniel Day-Lewis, along with his New Yorker accent was the best villain I've seen since Saruman of Lord of the Rings. He portrays Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting with elegance and he goes with the flow. Its the first time I've seen him act and he was darn good. Too bad he died. Cameron Diaz was the one who should've died. LOl.<br/><br/>Great sound score too. Whoever supervised the music was top-notch. The mood was just right there. And the song ""The Hands That Built America"" by U2, though I'm not American, was one of my favorites. Its not the title, its the message. America today owes something to the people who built their country for what it is right now. 9/10."

","I went to see Scorsese's flick without being entirely sure of either what to expect or what, beyond the title, it was even really about. On reflection the best concise description I could come up with would be something like a cross between Goodfellas, The Mad Max series and Moulin Rouge with a bit of Braveheart celticism thrown in for quaint appeal.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, the movie is a loosely historically based look at the New York of the 1860's during the civil war when the local established gangs fought for control of the city with the hoards of Irish arriving in their thousands escaping the poverty and starvation of the old country. <br/><br/>In that context the film boasts quite an array of Irish talent ranging from Liam Neeson (Making a relatively early exit) and Brendan Gleeson to the unlikely appearance of Finbar Furey and Maura O'Connell (Both funnily enough playing singers!!). The main characters in Gangs of NY however are Bill the Butcher, played brilliantly nastily by Daniel Day Lewis and his opposite, Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) the second generation Irish son of a Kerry ""priest"" (Neeson). <br/><br/>The film begins with Amsterdam as a child, witnessing the epic street battle at the five points area of New York, between the Catholic Irish conglomeration of gangs led by his father's Dead Rabbits and the opposite collection of Anglo Saxon Native Gangs led by William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting. After the defeat and outlawing of the Dead Rabbits and the murder of his father by Bill, the action jumps forward some sixteen odd years to Amsterdam's return from a reform house (Hellgate House!) for revenge.<br/><br/>Following the Trojan premise that it is easier to defeat your enemies from within Amsterdam works his way into the upper hierarchy of Bills gang, ingratiating himself with Bill and even falling-in finally, after initial discord, with one of Bill many discarded mistresses, Jenny Everdeane (Played by Cameron Diaz). Of course all this is to one end, to ultimately avenge the murder of his father when the opportunity arises.<br/><br/>Day Lewis is great in the bawling, flamboyant, even overstated (ala Brando's Godfather) portrayal of the butcher - a horrendously cruel man who, at one point in the movie, describes for Amsterdam how he maintains control over the Five Points by sheer fear and retribution.<br/><br/>The strange thing about Gangs of New York however is though it's set quite evidently and topically in civil war New York, during riots which erupted in supposed protest against the drafts of soldiers to supply the ranks of the Union Armies, it is almost futuristic in its portrayal of The Big Apple. In that context one can't but wonder what influence its development in the shadow of September 11th 2001 played both in Scorsese's vision of a decimated anarchistic New York and also something of a homage to what created the city in the first place and what helped it recover from that day. Certainly hats are tipped and credit (thought, in some aspects of the portrayal, not altogether complementary) or acknowledgment is made to the integral role the Irish played in the development of both the police force and Fire Service of NYC. Again and again one is drawn back to subtle references to 911, even in the conclusion, as a historical panorama of Manhattan from across the Hudson pans the skyline which develops over a series of photographs scanning 140 years and ends with a still standing twin towers nestling among the rest of the skyscrapers that now cover the same streets as The Paddies and The Nativists held sway some 140 years ago.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is an interesting film - I'm still not entirely decided if it's a great one but it's certainly entertaining. It is violent but considerably less dependent on blood and gore than Braveheart or Gladiator. I would say too that the big screen does justice to its sprawling historical panorama and a subject matter which has been somewhat diplomatically airbrushed out of conventional American History."

","Let me say this film was fantastic and a marvel to behold. The only reason I have given it a 9 instead of a 10 is because I always feel there is room for improvement no matter how great a film (in this case, perhaps the director's cut would warrant a 10). I was also a bit displeased that U2 was involved with the music, but I cannot honestly say the music was bad.<br/><br/>Coming in around three hours, and taking up two discs, some people would consider this movie a bit on the long side. Me? I would gladly have sat through another hour of this epic masterpiece. I have watched it twice now (that's six hours) and wouldn't mind a third time in the future. The storytelling is crisp, fresh and bold -- the characters believable, three-dimensional and asking for our empathy. As much as I wanted to hate The Butcher and root for young Amsterdam, I couldn't help but feel I knew exactly where the villain was coming from. In his own way, he is the American hero he makes himself out to be.<br/><br/>The story starts off with you thinking the plot is a simple tale of a son avenging his father's death. But this is only one plot line. It's a story of immigration, politics, the Civil War and of loyalty and honor. Such historical figures as P. T. Barnum and Horace Greeley grace the screen to give the film a wider context which it willingly and eagerly accepts. <br/><br/>The battle scenes are some of the best you'll ever see with great carnage and some vibrant and imaginative costumes. The costumes in general are amazing with their unique styles that could only have worked in this film. If you don't like blood, this might not be the movie for you, but is tame in comparison to many other choices out there and less violent than many war films.<br/><br/>I am not very familiar with director Martin Scorsese's work, but based on this film and ""Goodfellas"" I would say that he could easily be considered one of the best directors of our time (many people surely already think of him in this way). ""The Departed"" really clinched this belief for me. While Scorsese received the Oscar for ""Departed"", I think he really earned it during ""Gangs of New York"". But, better late than never.<br/><br/>DiCaprio delivers his strongest performance ever in this movie, or at least up to this point in his career (which is saying a lot coming from a fan) and Daniel Day-Lewis shows us he is the very definition of what a perfect method actor should be. I believed he really was Bill the Butcher and I think at times he believed it, too. No other character from film stands out in my mind as being as memorable as he. Even Cameron Diaz, whom I extremely dislike, put on a dazzling display. My only complaint about her in this film is that she is Cameron Diaz, but I guess she has little control over that.<br/><br/>The sets? Awesome. Who needs crappy computer imagery when you have sets like these? I could go on and on for pages at a time about this movie, but I think you understand where I am going: completely perfect film."

","For me, most of the films in 2002 sucked hard, but this film grasped me completely with a sense of amazement and darkness. i have not seen many Scorsese films, but of the ones I've seen, this is his best! The film is based on the brutal, depressing, and savagery of New York before modernization. It goes back in the 1800s before and during the Civil war. it was the time when gangs ruled the streets, the cops were outnumbered and corrupt, and the majority of people suffered.<br/><br/>The story follows a man named Amsterdam Vallon (Leo DiCaprio), who as a child, in the beginning, witnesses his father, Priet Vallon (Liam Neeson), brutally murdered in a vicious and highly intense brawl of hundreds of men slaughtering one another when the streets and the snow in 1846. He was murdered by a man named Will Cutting, or has he was known as Bill the Bucher, outstandingly played by Daniel Day-lewis.<br/><br/>After sixteen years of the fight in the streets in 1846, Vallon returns as a young man to find the man who killed his father, and seek vengeance. he returns to the New York City which has only grown deeper into a city of sin to find Bill the Butcher. He encounters many obstacles including a young woman, they call a 'turtle dove' (Cameron Diaz who pick-pockets for a living.<br/><br/>He later on finds Bill, and instead of seeking immediate vengeance he develops an unusual father-and-son relationship that makes the film all the powerful. Amsterdam, head-on learns the true nature of New York and how to survive in it with victory. But when Bill learns Amsterdam's intentions, he is banished and therefore he builds an army to take on Bill and his gang of the Five Points to rule New York City. little does everyone know that the war is worsening, and it'll outbreak in the city itself, creating chaos and inevitable destruction.<br/><br/>Winner of ten academy award nominations, the film truly deserved all of them; at least a lot of them. the costumes and set-decorations were authentic and pretty, the cinematography explored the mood of a forgotten city, the music was dark and rather vacant, but above all, the acting by Daniel Day-Lewis was truly Oscar worthy! But this film isn't for everyone. the film is depressing and dark, people, especially woman are portrayed as whores in it, and the violence in this film was deeply brutal. I am not much of a squeamish person, but this film was bad enough to catch me off guard and make me say ""oh my God!"" literally, there's blood and bodies flowing in the streets in the start and the violent climax.<br/><br/>For me, it was probably the year's best film. Everything was great, besides the gritty violence, but also the pace dragged in places. it not only depicts its gritty and violent nature, but also the power of manipulation. 9/10 It's not the best film I've seen, but the best of 2002."

","This is a fantastic view of what life used to be like for different cultures in the streets of New York in the 19th century. This is a type of film where you can watch it once then watch it right over again. The film lasts for 2 hrs 30 Mins, and there is not one dull moment. The only thing that lets it down slightly is Leonardo's Irish accent. I am from an Irish family and i know an Irish accent. He can't do it to save his life. The best thing about this film is Daniel Day Lewis. He is superb as Bill the Butcher. This is probably the best performance I have ever seen in a film. I recommend this to anyone. Although, if I was a parent i wouldn't show this film to young kids, purely because of the bloody violence and the racial content of this film. But, if you know someone who is old enough and hasn't seen this masterpiece, they don't know a great film from a sack of potatoes. It is just incredible !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"barnabyrudge","8","0","1","2 April 2006"," Well made though overlong piece of early New York history.
","Gangs Of New York is an over-dramatised but compelling story of the struggle to make New York City into a place of law and decency. Set in the 19th Century and shot on incredibly convincing sets, the film is a triumph of design. However, it is not without certain flaws - notably excessive length, artistic licence taken with some of the facts, and the wrong actors in a few key roles. Martin Scorsese directs the whole affair with a sense of great importance, and a few political statements simmering away in the background, but his epic vision was largely snubbed by the Academy Award voters who cynically - and perhaps correctly? - presumed that the director was almost trying TOO hard to make an award winning film. Where Scorsese should receive a nod of approval, though, is in his attempts to revise certain falsehoods about American history. In the Civil War, the Union were promoted as great heroes and protectors of freedom while the Confederates were presented as racist thugs, but Scorsese shows how some pretty disgraceful attitudes towards foreigners (both black and white) existed on all sides. Also, America has always been hailed as the Land of Opportunity, but Scorsese shows conditions for the arriving immigrants to be terribly hostile and unwelcoming in those early days.<br/><br/>In New York City in the mid-19th Century, the streets are littered with stench and decay, and various gangs battle for control of the lawless neighbourhoods. Father Vallon (Liam Neeson) is angered by the hostility and squalor in which he and his fellow Irish immigrants exist, so he challenges Bill ""The Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) to a fight for control of a district called The Five Points. Bill is in charge of the Natives, a gang who despise the endless influx of foreign filth into their land. Vallon is killed during the bloody street battle, and his young son witnesses his death amid the carnage. Sixteen years later, Vallon's son - who has grown up in a reform house - returns to the Five Points under the name of Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Caprio). Amsterdam finds the district under the absolute control of Bill The Butcher, who seems to have even the lawmen and the politicians in his pocket. Over time, Amsterdam works his way into Bill's employ and even becomes a sort of son-he-never-had figure in the eyes of the brutal Butcher. But New York is on the verge of imploding as the army constantly ignore popular opinion to round up citizens and immigrants to replenish the Union Army - this forced drafting of new soldiers eventually climaxes in a citywide riot. In the midst of this bloody confrontation, Amsterdam finally comes into his own private conflict with the Butcher for the revenge he has lusted after since his father's death.<br/><br/>Day-Lewis is utterly fantastic as Bill the Butcher, cleaving the skulls of his enemies with a machete and spitting vehement hatred at incoming mongrels with terrifying conviction. The Butcher is truly a screen character destined to be remembered for all-time. Di Caprio is less impressive as Amsterdam - yes, he looks more beefed-up than in other pictures and, under Scorsese's direction, he gives a passable performance - but he just isn't the right choice for this role. Diaz, as a woman who comes between them, performs decently enough even if her character is rather under-developed. The film is shot with great impact by Michael Ballhaus, who captures the filth and local colour of this pit of criminals in stunning detail, and makes some of the street battles seem very urgent and shockingly gory. Less impressive is Howard Shore's anachronistic score, which really sounds all wrong for this period locale. Gangs Of New York is a flawed but fascinating story - a film that ultimately reaches just a bit beyond its grasp but manages to be enthralling and magnificent in defeat."

","Surprisinsly, when considering that this came late in his career, and also that Scorseze is generally overrated, Gangs Of New York is a vital film. Less a historical tribute, this is more of a sociological essay on the mechanisms of control and power, occasionally reaching philosophical levels in it's pondering on human society, politics and religion. A touch of stylized violence and an excellent performance by Daniel-Day Lewis, as opposed to the mediocre Leonardo DiCaprio, also help elevate the film. The ending sequence is perhaps the most poignant of all, showing modern-day New York (representing the modern world in general) being built upon the foundations of old gangland New York, aka symbolically the age-old mechanisms of oppression and brainwashing applied by the state to pursue it's own means."

","This was a project of Martin Scorsese's which he had been trying to make since the late 1970s but there's no denying that the delay was very much for the best. If he had made it in the late 70s/early 80s it would not have done as well at the box office, he would not have had the talents of Mr Di Caprio and Miss Diaz, and he would not have been able to use the marvellous CGI effects of the early 21st century. It captures the period beautifully and the look of the film is very much like the contemporary news drawings that punctuate the action. It is certainly a violent film but it makes violence look repellent. There is one bit that is slightly clichéd, namely where Amsterdam removes Jenny's bodice and discovers a scar. The closing scene, where Jenny and Amsterdam are in the graveyard with burning 1860s New York in the background and they fade away and then there are scenes going through the decades with the New York skyline changing and the graveyard becoming progressively more overgrown is tremendous and haunting. There's no way a scene like that could have been done in the late 1970s.Well done to Bono, U2, and Andrea Corr (who should have been given a cameo role) and Sharon Corr for such a marvellous end titles track, The Hands That Built America. And congratulations to Mr Scorsese for such a great film that tackles a little known piece of US history."
"jaesboxer","6","0","1","4 March 2006"," A Magnificent Failure
","Watching Gangs of New York is sort of like witnessing a beautiful ship sink under its own weight. The film is, in my opinion, ultimately a failure, but it is a spectacular failure. It feels incomplete, crude, almost a prototype of a masterpiece. Martin Scorsese continues to move away from his gritty roots toward the artistic and the epic, a field that he in which he has already proved himself with the beautiful masterpiece Kundun. Gangs of New York is a story of vengeance, set against the backdrop of the 1860s New YOrk, a city divided into tribes at war. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a surprisingly decent performance as the young Amsterdam Vallon, whose father, the ""Priest"" Vallon (Liam Neeson, in a great cameo), was killed in an epic battle between the IRish immigrants and the ""Natives"" by William Cutting, ""Bill the Butcher."" DiCaprio proves that he can indeed act beyond the range of the Titanic sweetheart, and gives impetus for his superior role in The Aviator. The acting honours of this film, however, go to Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill. This is Lewis' best performance yet, and in this film he stands as a Titan amongst minnows, and creates a character so complex and fascinating that one cannot help but think this film is unworthy of him. Bill is a born killer, who uses his butcher knives and knowledge of anatomy to stike down his enemies in single blows. The film is pretty much divided into two acts: the first is brilliant, the second is a disaster. In the first, we have a story of vengeance and valour. Perhaps Bill's most fascinating quality is his similarity to the knights of old. He and his enemy, Priest Vallon, were both men of warrior character, two similar natures placed on opposites sides of the battlefield. The respect that Bill renders to the memory of Priest Vallon as the only great warrior he ever knew, a respect and amity free of hatred now that his foe is vanquished, forestalls Amsterdam's ideas of revenge. Amsterdam finds himself drawn to the man who killed his father, recognizing in him the same great character of his father. He ultimately is protected under the wings of the dragon, and is driven near madness by the affection which he feels coupled with hatred. The second act begins after Amsterdam reveals his real nature, and is set up against the Butcher. From here on, the film degenerates into a typical story of war. Though this is weak, its promise of an apocalyptic war between the two factions keeps the tension high. It is utterly inexcusable that Scorsese robs us of this final pleasure, substituting a violent riot that extinguishes all the momentum of the last two hours, and leaves the final fight between Amsterdam and the Butcher awkward and unsatisfying. Ultimately, this is a film worth seeing, and one cannot help but lament the failure of the masterpiece that could have been."
"alexandra-25","Null","0","1","4 March 2006"," This is a perspective on anarchy.
","Gangs of New York is a retrospective view of history, and events, which is actually extrapolated from anarchy and fascist style rule of the type that culminates with the formation of a modern Western democracy.<br/><br/>It seems that Gangs of New York is meant to illustrate why democracy is important in that it brings about a civilised world, or at least purports to. But as we have not yet evolved to a fully fledged civilised world, - with only appearances of it - then perhaps the democratic process is not yet complete. Here in Gangs of New York democracy is finally and in the end implemented as a suppressant for the purpose of subtle means of subordination of socially excluded, poor, and disenfranchised people, by the bourgeoisie. Hence the reason why it is important to director Scorcese to juxtapose wealth and poverty to bring home this point. Indeed, those who are supporters of democracy are more likely to be the puppets of the rich who want to suppress the poor and use suffrage and the democratic process for their own ends and for their own gains. Until this happens, then the rich must support a dictator, as in the film's Bill the Butcher, and likewise as history highlights in Italian fascism and German Nazism.<br/><br/>In this respect director Scorsese brings a depth to the film which suggests it needs to be very closely viewed. In order to do this one must detach ones self from other aspects of the film, such as acting, production etc.<br/><br/>This said the production, to an extent is in the style of Sir David Lean's, with an extra nod towards his version of Dickens Oliver Twist fable, and to that extent Dickens himself.<br/><br/>In fact the acknowledgement of Dicken's Oliver Twist in Gangs of New York comes from Decapprio's character, who like Oliver Twist becomes an orphan. Indeed, the murder of his dad by Bill the Butcher resulting in his being brought up in a harsh orphanage, -which Decapprio's character makes reference to in the film - is perhaps what actually makes Decapprio's character angry towards Bill the Butcher. Other reference points to Dicken's Oliver Twist come in the form of Diaz's character Jenny, who is an acknowledgement of Nancy, who in the novel has an intimate relationship with Bill Sykes. Likewise Jenny has a similar relationship with Bill the Butcher in the film, who is a newer revision and interpretation of Dicken's Bill Sykes.<br/><br/>As for acting in this film, I think Decaprio's and Diaz's is undermined by their other none serious sugary roles in previous films. This colours the view of their acting ability, which is quite good, albeit not brilliant in this film. Decapprio needs more time to become a serious actor, and an elder statesman of film, which, as Gangs of New York illustrates he has the potential.<br/><br/>A final point to make about this film is the highlighting of bigotry and misogyny, the latter I'm only sorry to say is only touched upon.<br/><br/>In all, a film worth watching, but not absolute classical art."

","So it's not Raging bull, it doesn't compare to Goodfellas and it will never be as remembered as Taxi Driver. So what? Gangs is Scorsese's finest film outside of his ""holy trilogy"".It's a vibrant, alive, mesmerizing epic that not differently from other Scorsese films reminds us America was built with the blood of many, that the immigrants that helped forge the identity of this country did not find the American dream to be that easy to reach. It's also a compelling narrative about a young man trying to find his identity during turbulent times and how he will only grow if his people grow with him, if he leads them.<br/><br/>Is it a perfect film? No, it's not. It's flawed mostly because DiCaprio (good but not great) and Diaz (miscast) never transcend their roles. Day-Lewis on the other hand is superb. It's also plagued by a somewhat excessive camera work by Scorsese and unnecessary narration. Visually, it's a fantastic achievement. It's production design is tremendous and the costumes terrific.<br/><br/>What i love the most about this film though is it's passion to take risks and make it's statements. In an age where films seem more and more bland, unwilling to defend a cause, Gangs never falters. It's violent because the journey of the different people that made this country was violent. Scorsese clearly loves his story and he stands up for it. He avoids the fence, he avoids compromising his vision for the sake of his commercial viability. Time will hold Gangs in high regard, i have no doubt about it. In 20 years time people will not remember Chicago but they will remember Gangs of New York. A film this good, this powerful, that simply gets better with age will not be easily forgotten."

A great cast, also starring Liam Nesson, probably in his finest work since ""The Phantom Menace"" and Cameron Diaz, in probably her best work since ""The Mask"".

","I watched this movie, and could not get over how amazing it was. The cinematography alone is enough to make it worthwhile. But they went beyond that with an amazing cast, amazing costumes, and amazing music. The violence there is creates the atmosphere necessary for this movie to really get its plot line established. Who else agrees with me that Daniel Day Lewis should have gotten the academy award? I could not get over how fantastic he was. His accent was really believable, and it surprised me how he didn't falter with it, not even once. Daniel Day Lewis made an excellent antagonist. Cameron Diaz was also good in this movie, and it was an unexpected variation from a Charlie's Angel or a ditzy socialite from The Sweetest Thing. I loved how the costumes didn't look fabricated at all. They actually look like they used to be worn in the 19th century. My favorite was how they all wore those really big top hats. The music was an amazing mood setter when they were going into battle. It had a very adrenaline pumping element.<br/><br/>My only bad comment is Leonardo Dicaprio.

He again proves why he is the one of the best of his generation in his portrayal of Bill the Butcher. It'sa blessing every time he steps in front of the camera and this film is no different.

Her lack of acting skills continues to baffle me for someone who has been in movies for 10 years."

","You know, this is best watched when its a bit outdated and silent enough that no one ever thought it was popular those days, and now i had my couch for it on video.<br/><br/>Gangs of New York is a story about a certain history of 18th century New York, along its backdrafts of gangs and peasants, immigration settlements, popularity voting, and the city's involvement with the Civil War. The lead is DeCaprio, a son of a former gang leader waiting vengeance against the man who killed his father: Daniel-Day Lewis in his very remarkable role as Bill the Butcher. Unexpectedly entwining as his colleague, he learns his secrets and mysteries, until Lewis too learns about his kid.<br/><br/>I must admit, I was VERY impressed by Day-Lewis' role. Very believable, well acted, but...DeCaprio still can't make up his well-actedness in this role (and even in the Aviator) since Gilbert Grape. He seems to have this...fixed form...that directors wouldn't want to forcedly ruin it. Even better roles were Liam Neeson's small role as DeCaprio's father (a much better acted than his role as Qui-Gon Jinn), Brendan Gleeson as the Irish guide with an iron cane, and John C. Reilly as the former gang member who gave it up to being a local police officer.<br/><br/>The concept was very good, even the feel of the activities in its setting...but it's too...colorful...to believe that this is an 18th Century setting. I wish they decreased the camera color tones for this so that I may feel it. Another flaw is the ending. I know U2 made a good expression in his lyrics, but then the ending made this movie seemed oriented to the ""patriotism"" and not for either factual or entertainment. But, still, I enjoyed this movie (better that the Aviator)."

","What were those members of the Academy thinking? Martin Scorcese and Daniel Day-Lewis clearly deserved Oscars for their works of art. This slice of American History was fascinating the first time I saw it; then I went back to the theater to see it again . . .twice! When I read Jay Cocks's economically deft screen play, I appreciated it even more! <br/><br/>With the breathtaking sets and costumes, the action in several scenes seem to be played out within an antique jewel-box. Those inside the Chinese theater are especially rich. The depravity of the Five-Points exteriors, the dank, claustrophobia-inducing spaces of the Brewery together the interiors of Bill Cutting's place, Boss Tweed's Tammany Hall, the barber shop and the home of the wealthy are all so accurately detailed and typical of the period, I actually felt swept back into pre-Civil War America.<br/><br/>The direction was superb. Leo DiCaprio and Cameron Diaz performed ably. Liam Neeson, always a pro, WAS Priest Vallon, albeit for a short time. John C. Reilly did an outstanding and convincing job as Happy Jack, a corrupt ""peace officer"". In fact, there was not a less-than top performance to be found; even the extras'characters were realistic.<br/><br/>But the flawlessly brilliant performance of Daniel Day-Lewis was positively riveting! There is nothing he can't do, making it all look totally natural and effortless. His ""Boxer"" and especially his Nathaniel of ""Last of the Mohicans"" are unforgettable, magnetic, beautiful men. DD-L is an artist who is in a category of his own.<br/><br/>His Butcher Bill is the most sympathetic ""bad guy"" of any film I have ever seen. You know he's rotten to the core, but he is absolutely irresistible. As he sits wounded and literally wrapped in the flag of his beloved America, few women could resist wrapping their arms around him; I certainly couldn't! His reverence for Priest Vallon and his ""adoption"" of Vallon's son actually made me feel sorry for him. In GANGS there is no distinction between the character and the actor; they are truly one and the same. And that odd accent! It really puts the icing on the cake. He chills, he thrills; what more can we ask from a fighter, a lover, a protector, a killer? One of the very best performances (next to ""Mohicans"") of all movie history! GANGS is a must see for the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis, for the sets, costumes, wonderful choreography of both the fights and the dancing, and for its masterful directing."

","Gangs of New York is one of Martin Scorsese's greatest films. The scope of this film is enormous and overwhelming. It was actually the first Scorsese picture that I ever saw, and after viewing it, I was so impressed and immediately went to the video store to rent some of his other films such as Taxi Driver and Goodfellas. Wow. This movie blew me away. Daniel Day-Lewis gives, what I believe, to be one of the greatest performances that I have ever seen in film. He is a perfect villain who will haunt your dreams for years to come. It is really hard for me to believe that, after gaining 10 Academy Award nominations, Gangs of New York went home with nothing. This is an outrage. This was the best film of 2002, and it was wiped out by Chicago!?! The opening battle sequence in this film is one of the best that I have ever watched. Scorsese nailed it. Another sequence that has always stayed with me is the one in which a building is burning and two different fire departments arrive at the same time. However, instead of working together to extinguish the flames, the two fire departments do battle and then raid the neighboring building, which was perfectly fine. I understand that events like this did occur in New York during that time period. The world of Gangs of New York is real, or at least it was. Scorsese resurrected it to show to the world."
"shierfilm","Null","0","1","4 July 2005"," A Scorsese classic
","Time will prove Gangs of New York to be an exhalted classic.<br/><br/>The first time I saw it in theatres (Christmas 2002) I admired the spectacle but the story left me cold. It wasn't until I started watching the DVD that it sunk in how grand and beautiful this film is.<br/><br/>The production design is stellar. No one can say the film doesn't look authentic (New York 1860's). From the glorious costumes and sets to the extremely evocative music, Scorsese has re-defined verisimilitude. Check out the featurettes on the DVD re: set design and costumes. Your jaw will drop at the scale and scope of Martins' vision.<br/><br/>But to the most important of matters: STORY. This is American history, or to be specific: New York City history. One viewing will not suffice. This film demands your attention, and discerning film buffs should be enthralled that a film of this type has been made. (So many movies today lack passion and power. God bless the master Scorsese).<br/><br/>We are taken to The Five Points, a slummy area of New York. Immigrants are flooding in, coming off ships from Ireland & Europe, and the ""Natives"" are quite upset that their ""chosen ground"" has been polluted with people who were not ""born right-wise"". The climate is so ominous and poverty-stricken and gritty, that just about anything goes. In Scorsese's movie we see just what it was like in those insane days of war & corruption and new beginnings.<br/><br/>You have gangs who capitalize on the social scene (if that's a proper phrase), you have Boss Tweed ripping everything off, you have the civil war, you have an anti-immigrant butcher (who also runs a fire hall) creating and maintaining fear of loss of his countries' identity, and you have a spirited son of a Priest who lays to rest ""his father's ghost"".<br/><br/>Masterpiece. The film is awesomely compelling from start to finish.<br/><br/>The reasons? Director. (Martin Scorsese) Actor. (Daniel-Day Lewis) Photography. (Michael Ballhaus) Set/Production Design (Dante Ferreti) Editing (Thelma Schoonmaker) Music (Robertson, Pook, etc..)<br/><br/>All elements vital to the creation of classic film art.<br/><br/>I could talk about this film for hours, but I'll settle for watching it over and over and over again. It never loses it's power or integrity and I thank the cinema Gods that Scorsese exists. His films have a quality that defies the simple term ""movies"".<br/><br/>His work is special and for those who know, this film is an ""I remember you, New York"" from a man who was born there and will probably die there."

","This is a very good picture, but not a great one. Martin Scorsese brings us a very medieval look to late 1800s New York. It works for this movie, it is it's own world that is easy to get caught up into. It is a bit too long, but any one who considers themselves a fan of acting needs to see this. The reason is the performance of Daniel Day Lewis as William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting. He is simply wonderful, it is the best performance in the history of cinema...period. He completely wraps himself into the character. Very soon into the movie, it becomes clear that this has turned into a display case for Day Lewis' talent. He is mesmerizing, he steals every scene, although it was not too difficult to steal the scenes from Cameron Diaz and Leonardo Dicaprio (I must say that Leo's performance was not bad, he showed great potential, Diaz was out of place) Diaz is not an actor, she is a movie star, Leo is border line, but everyone else is an actor, John C. Reily, Jim Broadbent, Liam Neisen, and of course the completely underrated Daniel Day Lewis. See the movie for his performance, it is still very good and entertaining."

However, this movie is set before the birth of Al Capone and his Italian gang. Set in 1863 New York, as the Civil War rages on, the movie let me down a little. <br/><br/>Amsterdam Vallon is the son of murdered gangs leader Priest Vallon of the Dead Rabbits Irish gang. After a grotesque battle at the start of this film, the movie takes an awkward turn into a slow drama in which Vallon goes to work for his fathers murderer Bill The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis) and then begins to plan against him. <br/><br/>Gangs of New York was long, too long yet it was fascinating. Seeing how the Irish were actually treated coming from a famine stricken country and how they weren't afraid to stand up against government and society was interesting. I've researched this era and am quite familiar with what actually happened. The riots at the end of this film were portrayed accurately being based solely on the issue of drafting immigrants and Tammany Hall's sway in office. <br/><br/>The city design and filming location was excellent.Acting was alright.

It is only kept alive by greedy corporations who use their money to bribe and blackmail politicians; and thereby insure they have a work force that is completely at their mercy.

","Martin Scorsese...ten nominations...and lots of blood shed. This is Gangs of New York, a thrilling and monotonous (at times) epic, but the message that the movie gets across is printed on the last frame shot of the movie of progressing change of New York City. ""These are the hands that built America."" Based on the riots of New York in the 1800s, where America was at its lowest point, Amsterdam Vallon (with Leonardo DiCaprio making another period attempt, but comes to a seven on the attempt scale) returns to New York City with vengeance on William ""The Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis) for killing his father after many years. In ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" fashion, he befriends ""The Butcher"" and becomes an adversary on the outside, while he romances a pick-pocket, Jenny, (a very snoring and predictable love story) played by a very red-headed Cameron Diaz. The supporting cast is even more excellent as 2002's ""actor of the year"" John C. Reilly (Whom also starred in two other Oscar nominated movies, ""Chicago"" and ""The Hours"")and the chameleonic talents of Jim Broadbent, who makes a great portrayal of the dirty mayor William ""Boss"" Tweed. The excitement of the movie speeds up as it goes through the 1800s, through the many themes of the movie; Vallon versus ""The Butcher""; The Natives versus the Dead Rabbits, Politicians versus the lower-class, Pride versus Vengeance, and particularly the rich versus the poor. In my opinion, this movie was very much like a Shaara novel, full of description and very well at graphics and gore, in order to show how people have given their lives, whether unneeded to show that ""Someone must die in order for the rest of us to learn how to live"" (-Virginia Woolf, ""The Hours"") or for the pride of to becoming an American (""The Butcher""). You can feel war and smell blood at every corner and the movie-goer can possibly understand what it felt like to live back then. For me, this movie is a testament to my Irish ancestors, and I have never more been more proud to be Irish or an American. 7/10"

Having been to Ireland, I know have a better appreciation of this and films like The Boxer and In the Name of the Father. Ireland is a beautiful place and I would someday like to return.

","The nineteenth century was an incongruous time for many peoples. The British empire was losing its worldwide coverage, and the Russian monarchy was but a century or less away from annihilation. Indeed, many films that are set in this era use it as a setting, but very few have depicted it in realistic terms. Gangs Of New York is the first film I have seen, and I have seen many of all varieties, than even makes the attempt. Whether or not they succeeded, I won't say, but they deserve credit for trying.<br/><br/>The New York of the nineteenth century is shown as a decadent, corrupt place where roving gangs regular war with one another. It begins with one such battle, in which migrants fight with a group of men who are all whiter than I am, but claim to be natives. Oh well, if they were born there, I cannot argue with them too much, but it does feel strange when the actual natives of America are nowhere to be seen in this production. Still, this opening battle sequence does give a nice, authentic feel for the story.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis absolutely shines as Bill The Butcher, a character you want to hate but just cannot because of the elegant human quality he brings to his performance. Although the film tries to show him as little as he is needed, this is his show. He keeps the audience's attention on the screen in spite of the charisma vortex in the rest of the cast. Speaking of a charisma vortex, one has to wonder exactly what they thought when they cast Leo DiCaprio in what is essentially a gangster film. I'm yet to be convinced that he really even grew that facial hair. Cameron Diaz is little better. She is thoroughly unconvincing as a nineteenth-century prostitute. Which should surprise nobody - she has a difficult time convincing anyone that she is a twenty-first century human being.<br/><br/>Some elements of the story are quite hilarious to behold. Whenever I hear someone rabbiting on about how much better we had it in times when the church had greater control of our daily lives or the like, I often kindly request they take a look at things, fictional or no, that say otherwise. The fighting between the fire brigades in this film is one of those things. I'm sure these historical retro-rose-eyeglass wearers would gladly go back to such a time. Then again, when I see the police having to brace themselves against angry citizens breaking into their headquarters instead of the reverse, I guess maybe they have some point, however small.<br/><br/>Acting aside, there are some unfortunate decisions made. Whomever was arranging the music should have told Scorcese (or vice versa) that U2 lost whatever credibility they had long ago. I swear, if I hear Bono Vox repeat that these are the hands that built America one more time, I am going to want to put his head further into his rectum. The editing is also a tad off-centre, with much of the final riot in New York seeming like a montage of clips rather than a coherent whole.<br/><br/>Still, I gave Gangs Of New York a seven out of ten. It was one of the better films of 2002, and that it didn't win a singular Oscar out of the eleven or more that it was nominated for only further destroys the Academy's credibility. See it with a friend or loved one, and marvel at the work done to create the mood."

This film is very graphic and rather disturbing. But it is worth sitting through for the acting.<br/><br/>A lot of people have said that Daniel Day-Lewis should have won the best actor Oscar... and I won't say anything different. He was just phenomenal. Pure genius. He totally transformed himself into Bill the Butcher and not for one second could you see any part of Daniel the Actor. The expressions, the body-language, the dialogue delivery... absolutely brilliant. It's a shame that he hasn't done a lot more films but maybe that's where the ""quality over quantity"" factor comes in. He could easily be doing lots of movies, but I guess his greatness lies in the fact that he can come out every few years with a performance like his life depended on it and then disappear. One thing's for sure, he never loses his charm. One of the greatest of all time, definitely. <br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, but I do believe that he is an exceptional actor. ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"", ""Catch Me If You Can"" and now this one... all solid, intense performances. He really got into character and did a great job despite the accent slip-ups.<br/><br/>The less said about Cameron Diaz, the better. I will agree with everyone who has said that she was less annoying in this movie than usual. Decent performance, but nothing noteworthy.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast is great.

I suppose if he can raise millions upon millions for a production there are limitless possibilities, so why not squeeze in as many disparate elements as you can?<br/><br/>While it is true that the draft riots in New York occupy a significant page or two in the history of the Civil War, their unique relationship to the larger and ongoing question of anti-immigrant sentiment is more like a footnote to that greatest of all American episodes. Federalism has never set well with the American masses, especially those that made up the segment of the population known both before and since as Nativists. It was the frontier that gave birth to the popular notion of Manifest Destiny and all the other myths upon which the Nativists continue to feed. Paradoxically it was also the frontier that nurtured the belief that immigrants who became true-blue Americans were entitled to full social equality and a great share in the riches emanating from that ever-shining goal in the West.<br/><br/>I don't think this film wants to deal with any of that. It begins and ends as a formulaic Hollywood blockbuster, colored a curious orange all the way through as if to mimic someone's sense of what a world filled with candlelight might have looked like. Everything about it is overblown, the kind of film where one expects to see a smiling extra peeking out at the camera from time to time. It is almost like an old musical without the music, where everything seems choreographed rather than natural. What a shame.<br/><br/>Everyone knows that Daniel Day-Lewis steals the show, so I won't labor that point. Di Caprio is out of his element, which is playing roles without rough edges. Diaz is the typical stage ingenue. The rest of the cast march solidly through their lines without missing a beat from the director. I wonder... where have I seen this before? Answer, in many other films from D.W. Griffith to Frank Capra to the older version of Martin Scorcese.<br/><br/>Time to hang up the stovepipe hat."

","I saw this film in theater while my parents went to see The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. I initially agreed to see Gangs of New York because of Daniel Day-Lewis, who happens to be one of my favorite actors. In addition, Martin Scorsese had directed it, so I trusted it would be good. Not so. The first few sequences were undoubtedly attention-grabbing, but after the first half hour, things became incredibly boring. About a quarter of the way into the film, I dozed off and didn't wake up until the last quarter of the film. The seats in the theater were particularly comfortable that day, and I couldn't resist the temptation to sleep. Anyway, Amsterdam Vallon wasn't doing much to keep me awake. I've never been a big fan of Leonardo DiCaprio, and I was an even smaller fan after seeing him in this film. What the hell was up with his accent? I was never sure what nationality he was supposed to be, going completely by his accent. Was he Scottish? Maybe southern, or a combination of the two? His attempt at creating an Irish accent was painfully unimpressive. I've heard genuine Irish-speaking people, and let me tell you: Leo cannot do accents. Who was his dialogue coach anyway? That person should be fired. I understand that petty details such as accents shouldn't have all the weight, so I will give some praise to this overblown, overpublicized film: it did give the audience a graphic gore fest complete with severed limbs and other various modes of human execution. Daniel Day-Lewis was about the only tolerable actor, and Cameron Diaz was plain obnoxious, as always. I should have gone to see The Two Towers..."

","The first two minutes was impressive. Then something happened and the movie lost its whole presuasive power over me. I saw a wee woman with sharp, pointy teeth and artificial claws joining the rest of the men to take part in the street battle. Now, realize that this is a fight with no precision weapons, where brute strength, height, arm reach and endurance count way more than agility. And Mr Scorcese was showing me this little woman jumping over massive men and killing them with her claws and bites. Wow ! So cool! Well, granted, I am aware of the ""Hell Cat Maggie"" legend. But I didn't think the film was based on legends. At least, a taller and muscular actress could have been used to play this character. Is it really necessary to include this character and mess with the whole realism of the movie?<br/><br/>Just when I was getting over this stupidity I saw a black gang member with Johnny (the good gang member that helped Amsterdam when they were children). Just how realistic is it that an African boy is allowed into a white gang in one of the most racist chapters of New York history? How come people like William Cutting and McGroin tolerate this guy's activities in the neighbourhood? How realistic is it that this African boy (not even a man yet) pushes white men to vote for a candidate in the heat of the Civil War when African Americans were seen as the reason for the war?<br/><br/>These might seem like minor points for many. But, I think they make that little difference between a good movie and a great movie. IMHO, this movie was good. But it was mostly due to Lewis' spectacular acting. DiCaprio was OK, but one expects a more convincing performance from a lead actor. I guess it was his mishap acting against Daniel Day Lewis. Contary to what many think, I think Diaz was a good choice for the playful, humorous, and sexy vixen female character; Jenny Everdean. There wasn't much to act in her character anyway. This movie is NOT underrated."

","What could have been the best film since the turn of the century has been spoiled by the worst of the worst attempts by American actors to imitate the Irish accent. Leonardo DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz, John C. Reilly, Cara Seymour and Stephen Graham bring new meaning to the 'stage-Irish' clichÃ©(actually the first two hardly bothered changing their accents). And Gary Lewis is just laughable as an Irish traitor with a thick-as-porridge Scottish accent.Henry Thomas is the only actor who would get away with it, but it wasn't great all the same. Most of the minor Irish characters are either Scottish or from Liverpool(especially those who were hanged). How could a great director like Martin Scorcese mistake an Irish accent for a Scottish accent?<br/><br/>However, Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic as the sadistic, immigrant-hating Bill the Butcher, completely overshadowing the miscast stars. Brendan Gleeson and Liam Neeson also delivered fine performances. It could have been so much better; the street battles are fantastic, the music is excellent and the general atmosphere is compelling, it's just a pity about the accents."

","In 1846 a boy sees his father killed in a gang battle on the Five Point slums of New York and grows up intent on patient and cold blooded revenge.<br/><br/>Only Martin Scorsese could get this pointless and expensive pot-boiler made and only the presence of a top class actor like Daniel Day-Lewis stops it from falling apart at the seams. God bless him for taking the role, he couldn't be bad in anything even if he tried. <br/><br/>While fortunes have been spent on the setting (very convincing too) what goes on in the foreground is backside achingly dull. MS seems to know it too and the only thing he can think of is to throw in lots of violence, sex and pop music (yes you read me right!) hoping to spice up the tasteless and banal life-on-the-street soup. <br/><br/>This is a Dickensian world of thieves, gangs, corruption and intrigue, but despite having three writers it has no soul and no depth. Charles Dickens took us to the underworld but we got a sense of time, place and purpose among the downbeats and the downtrodden. Here we have only cartoons (corrupt cop, corrupt politician, big bad boss, etc.). We are stuck on no-hope street - you are born stupid, live stupid and die stupid. Usually in some violent and over-the-top way.<br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio is a problem because he is not much of an actor. Good looking and high cheek-boned he has not had his ""Born of the Fourth of July"" - where Tom Cruise won an Oscar nomination and proved he could, if pushed, act a bit. His character is stupid and uneducated, but smearing dirt on your face and voicing words in cod Irish (that is what it sounds like anyway) is not really acting and doesn't carry the weight of the picture at all.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis is supposed to be the arch villain but we are with him all the way because he is the only one doing anyway remotely interesting or having anything remotely interesting to say! Cameron Diaz dyes her hair red and plays an Irish pickpocket, but seems a bolt-on to establish the leads heterosexuality. <br/><br/>The film had production difficulties and you can see why. You can almost hear them in the screening room whispering ""this isn't working - this isn't working"" as you watch the film. The book may have have seemed fascinating and historical in print (to Martie anyway), but has little impact on the screen. Losers, lose - but before they lose they fight, screw and shout at each other a lot. <br/><br/>I was glad when the last throat had been slashed and the last drop of blood had run down the snowy NY gutter, because it fell short of cheap TV on the entertainment front and had precious little to offer as a history lesson."

","This is a pretty impressive film; most of its qualities are good, if not great. However, it still falls short on a few points. The ending seems somewhat anti-climactic. Much of the film is overly Hollywood-like, as well. The climax is a letdown. Overall, the film is great, but it could have been fantastic. The love story is also too much of what we've seen hundreds of times before. The plot is good, and tells a tale that very well could have happened. It's fairly historically accurate. It's somewhat well-paced, but I ended up being bored in the last half hour or so, and downright disliking the very end. The acting is great. All of the actors pull off very good performances. Diaz, Day-Lewis, DiCaprio, all great. The supporting characters were well-acted as well. The characters were well-written, and mostly credible, though there were at least once where a character seemed to go very much out of character, apparently just to move the story along. The cinematography is great. It has a pretty good atmosphere, and there are scenes that feel very much like you are watching actual footage from that time. The film suffers somewhat from being predictable; it holds very few surprises, partly due to it being fairly formulaic. The film is well-done and the scenes that are supposed to be so, are intense. The special effects are well-done, and the direction is good. All in all, an entertaining and well-done film which is unfortunately dragged downwards in quality by various Hollywood-like qualities. I recommend it to fans of the respective actors, fans of the director, and people who enjoy watching films that depict certain time-periods to such accuracy. 8/10"

","My immediate feelings before seeing this film were recollections of the first half of Jerry McGuire ( an enjoyable romp ). I was not entirely happy with Di Caprio in the role of the son seeking revenge. He didn't come across to me as being slightly Irish with his Italian features. The other problem I had was how Bill the butcher allowed ex-Dead Rabbit members to join his clan. He is meant to be a blood thirsty killer ruthless in his pursuit of stopping Irish immigrants from entering New York. I did not see the logic in him keeping Irish members within his own clan or in doing very little against the further immigrants entering the city. Allowing Di Caprio to slowly build up a following also didn't make much sense.<br/><br/>The costumes were interesting although very theatrical. As for the truth behind the storyline, I doubt whether there was much in it regarding gang warfare in the city in those times. More likely it was between the black community and the whites. The love side of the story was all a bit pointless.<br/><br/>At the end the film appeared more like a common western hero v bad guy story rather than a film trying to say anything about a historical event."

Martin Scorsese has done a brilliant piece of work on this film and I should rate this as amongst his best works yet. I do believe that the ongoing romance between diCaprio and Diaz did not particularly enhance the viewing spectacle, I see it more as a vice than as a virtue. ""The Butcher"" was portrayed brilliantly especially at places where he himself was supposed to act to the mob around him. his capricious behaviour combined with deadly accuracy of his aim was remarkably portrayed."

","What I found most interesting about this movie was it's time period. It started out in NYC in 1846 and then finished in 1862, during the American Civil War. This period of time is unfamiliar to us. It was interesting in that you heard the names of streets that are still around, but their scenery is completely unfamiliar. I especially enjoyed the scene at the end during the closing credits where they show NYC fast-forward evolve from where it was back then to the skyscaper-festooned megalopolis that it is today.<br/><br/>The weakest part about the movie was its resolution. Needless to say, there was a gang-fight involved. However, for some reason the filmmakers mixed up two separate fights into one. Was this movie supposed to be about the tension between ethnic gangs of New York, or was it supposed to be a movie about the tension that led to the anti-draft riots of the Civil War? The two fights are unrelated, and I'm sure many people who saw this movie the first time may not have figured that out. This would be a source of confusion in this movie, and the filmmakers did a very bad job on this part. An anti-conscription riot gets started, while at the same time a gang-fight was about to start in another part of town. The conscription riots caused the US Army to get involved to put it down, which ends up interfering with and breaking up the gang-fight at the same time. Seems too implausible to believe!"

","I'm surprised at how hostile some of these reviews are, but truthfully I often react strongly to Scorsese films, either loving them (Taxi Driver, After Hours), hating others (the incomprehensibly acclaimed Raging Bull). My opinion of this one isn't that forceful, but I thought it was an entertaining movie.  Daniel Day-Lewis, who I consider overrated, is absolutely terrific, as is Jim Broadbent (as Boss Tweed), and DiCaprio and Diaz are both much better than I would have expected, giving effective performances.  It is stylishly made and keeps your interest, and the recreation of the draft riots is appropriately chilling.<br/><br/>I do think as history the movie is a bit of a cheat.  The movie is quite forthright in its depiction of anti-Irish sentiment but shies away from confronting the racism of the Irish, which wouldn't have seemed so blatantly wrong if that hadn't been a central component of the draft riots.  Scorsese seems to have wanted something morally unambiguous, but if he wanted that I think he chose the wrong moment in history for it."
"schizoferret","7","0","1","6 May 2004"," Cinema is about dreaming
","Don't let negative opinions put you off. It is one of rare examples of good balance between sentimentality and art in cinema. 'Gangs ...', with their beautiful pictures, first-sort editing and matching music are much more then a pseudo-historic movie as the aforementioned Braveheart. They tell a tale happening in a different world, so much different from the one we live in or see in 'normal' movies. The story and the characters may be a bit on the schematic side, like in about every Hollywood production, but this is a simplicity of a fairy-tale or a legend, and is completely adequate to a nostalgic - and somewhat colored up - vision of times and people long gone by. Having said that, the acting, as well as directing leave nothing to be desired.<br/><br/>
If you go to the cinema to dream a dream together with the director, like on Burton's or Jarmush's works, you should definitely see it."

","I gotta say I enjoyed the adventure of the film. The fight scenes are good. I think the movie should have won the Oscar for Best Costume Design and Best Original Song. But the problem is that the characters are all punks. And I suppose they all were at that time but I think most people have humanity, compassion, and mercy in them. Even toward their enemies and certainly toward each other. Yes there was a little between the good guys. But they feel such pride in fighting and if you feel that much pride and that little compassion after war then there is something wrong with you. This is supposed to be a movie about horrific things happening to good people and these people weren't good even though not all of them were bad. In fact the only two characters that were nothing but evil were Boss Tweed and Bill the Butcher. How can you feel sorry for them if they are not good? You could say the same thing about most Arnold Schwarzenegger movies but this movie is supposed to be showing how horrible this really was and it doesn't. But like I said it's a good adventure, but it is a bad drama. So some people get excited by this film. It has three great actors in it, Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis, and Jim Broadbent. And many more who are popular. So I wouldn't say don't ever see this movie. I'd watch it if I was just flipping through."
"mrcaw1","Null","0","1","5 May 2004"," Entertaining movie, but Scorcese's done better.......
","Certainly this is a well done movie. Big budget, A-list stars, one of the world's best directors. Much has been said of the authentic town reconstruction, well done cinematography. Is it one of my favorite films after seeing it? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes I did, but I wouldn't be in a rush to see it again anytime soon. Perhaps a couple of years from now I'll re-watch it and enjoy it more without the expectations that I had going in to the movie. What problems did I have with the movie? Well, it does suffer from what so many movies of our age suffer from and that is that it doesn't know when to end. It's an awfully long movie.  I also felt the movie had a very closed in feeling to it which was a result of Scorcese's decision to shoot as much of the movie as possible in the recreated set made for the movie. Personally I think this choice backfired to a certain degree. Sure you want to present an authentic setting (hence the reason for the realistic set) HOWEVER scene after scene set in the same sets and streets unfortunately gave the film the impression that the budget was in fact smaller than it was and that the whole movie was forced to use these sets because they couldn't afford location shots. It's like they shot the movie on a really cool looking back lot set which is I'm sure the opposite of what Scorcese was trying to accomplish. Ex, there's one scene in particular, where Cameron Diaz's character goes to another part of the city. You only get to see this set once, yet just by virtue of the fact that you're seeing a different locale was a welcome relief. I would have had more shots down by the docks, etc. Just because people lived in those crowded areas doesn't mean that they wouldn't venture to parks, the water's edge, etc to escape the over crowding. Well that overcrowding and constant focus on these built sets gave the film a low budget feel which is ironic of course since the sets cost so much to build. Certainly the casting of Diaz is troubling. Not a highly versatile actress she does what she can but her presence still strikes a jarring modern note while book-ended by the highly talented DiCaprio & Day Lewis immersing themselves in period feel. Where's Cate Blanchett when you need her? I know the movie was well liked when it came out and it is a good movie, but I suspect that over the years, much of the fanfare of this movie (similar to Saving Private Ryan) will die down and it will take its proper place in film history as a good movie that could have been so much more."

","Odd film. Both hated and loved.***SPOILERS WITHIN***<br/><br/>What was great? 1) The movie set was fabulous. Scorsese created a city that I could have watched for another hour and a half after the movie finished. Who cares where it was filmed? Purists whine that it was filmed in Italy. So what? 2) Daniel Day-Lewis. I hadn't researched the origins of his accent, but it sounds believable that his is an accurate mixture of British and Dutch. He played a bad, bad man, and he did it well. 3)History lesson. The depiction of the draft riots, though white washed from the actual race riots they were, spurred me on to read up on this forgotten pocket of history. 4)Liam Neeson as priest. He just kicks. Period.<br/><br/>What was okay? Cameron Diaz came and went. The more she fell in love with Amsterdam, the more irritating she got. DiCaprio was okay. I wasn't expecting much, he held his own. He's no Divine or Dolemite. Some of the characters, like the lady with the sharpened teeth in the opening fight scene who ends up a drunken tavern owner is lost along the way. The opening MTV fight scene was kind of surreal, and worked for me. It seemed out of place, though.<br/><br/>What sucked? The storyline. I have the feeling that this was a 5-hour movie (that originally was supposed to feature the Clash) that went into fast forward for the last 45 minutes. The Butcher death scene was so abbreviated, I'm sure there's a good 15 minute fight scene in the vault somewhere.<br/><br/>Big picture, Scorsese created a great set with some great characters and a mediocre story that grinds to a halt. He took on alot, and delivered on some. Still interesting enough to be able to say you saw every single damn Scorsese movie."

But here the aim of that opening is to attract the average viewer into making him want to see the movie further by calling upon his vilest instincts, supported by a repetitive music to to prevent him from thinking and exercising his judgment.

Its an even worse shame that he did not win the Academy Award for that role.  Leonardo Dicaprio's performance was pretty good but nothing to write home about. John C.

"Colkitto","10","0","1","25 March 2004"," Scorsese on top form
","A mindblowing epic from a truly great director, this film has attracted a great deal of opprobrium from people who seem to have missed the point. I thus find myself forced to write a defensive review instead of simply raving about it.<br/><br/>#1: ""The plot is so hackneyed"". No it's not. Of course there are lots of revenge plots around; show me *any* movie and I'll show you a basic plot that's been used a thousand times before, but the good ones put new twists on them, and I felt that this was an original handling of the revenge plot (Amsterdam's growing closeness to Bill, the recognition that he is becoming like him, and even a genuine sympathy for the old monster aided this impression). It's a simple plot, certainly: but that's because the film is less about the story than about the evocation of an era, which was brilliantly realised. The story is there for the picture to hang on, which means that it needs to be strong but not too complex. It succeeds.<br/><br/>#2: ""The accents are terrible"": Have you any idea how much work went into getting these accents right? Of course Amsterdam and Jenny don't sound Irish: they've grown up in New York and naturally have mixed up accents. Of course Bill doesn't sound like a modern New Yorker: it's a well-researched old-fashioned Anglo-Dutch NY accent, predating other (particularly Italian) influences.<br/><br/>#3: Criticisms of the acting I simply don't understand. I used to dislike diCaprio, but he has grown stronger, surer and better in every film I've seen. There is only one point in this film where I felt his acting faltered for a few seconds - I'm not telling you where - and I was on the lookout for slips. Cameron Diaz rises beautifully to what is by far the greatest dramatic challenge of her career, while Daniel Day-Lewis and Jim Broadbent prove yet again that they can do no wrong.<br/><br/>Right, that's that off my chest. If you enjoy well-written, gorgeously shot gangland epics which bring together some of the finest acting and directing talents around, this is for you. If you can't cope with moral complexity or are too fidgety to sit still for three hours, blame yourself, not Scorsese."

","This is probably one of the best movies ever made in my opinion, and definitely one of my favourites. It's set in New York (obviously) in the 1800s and is about the underworld of then. A lot of people were complaining about how long it ran for, but I think long movies are far more engaging than a short one. It does go for about 2hours 45 minutes, but you won't be watching the clock. The acting is quite good, but I'm not a critic and I don't watch movies to see how good the actors are. I would have to say Daniel Day-Lewis was the best because he played a truly evil character, but there were times I couldn't help liking his ways.There was one thing I noticed; it was that Leonardo Di-Caprio can't really keep an American-Irish accent on very well at all times, but it's very minor and nothing bad. Why I loved this movie was because it reminded me of Braveheart in the way it was violent, but epic. Speaking of it, the violence in this film is very strong, especially at the start when the Irish immigrants and Bill The Butcher( Day-Lewis)'s gang fight. This scene sets up the story for the movie, in which Bill kills the Irish priest and gang leader, who is Amsterdam(Leo)'s dad. Amsterdam witnesses it and when he is grown up he plots to kill the Butcher. People were saying it was a lazy plot, but I found it very interesting and much better than a lot of movies of the historical/drama genre. The directing in this movie I thought was very good. Scorsese really makes the viewer feel like part of the movie in the street scenes, and the fight scene was also originally done, in a gradual build from Lord-Of-The-Rings-I-Cant-See-Who's-Killing-Who style, to a slow motion bloodbath of near decapitation, gut-spilling and major blood-losses.<br/><br/>Well, everyone has their own opinion, and those who didn't like this didn't like it, but I thought it was a definite classic that should have got best picture.

","Daniel Day Lewis gives a riveting, fascinating, over-the-top performance, one of his finest.  Unfortunately it is in this stink bomb of a movie. Rarely have I waited and anticipated a film to this level and rarely have I been so wildly disappointed.  Visually stunning the film is marred - and mired - by the protagonist of Leonardo di Caprio.  I can see why directors want him, he is capable in the right role (difficult for me to say this). In the right role he's less than adequate (and do people really find him THAT good looking?  That can't be the reason, can it?)  Here, di Caprio is a somnambulist, barely going through the motions.  I wanted to hold a mirror up to his mouth to see if he was really alive.  The only acting job I can think of worse then this in a major director's big budget mess was Sophia Coppola's in God Father III.  But she wasn't intended to carry the film as di Caprio is here.  <br/><br/>Daniel Day Lewis deserved a better vehicle.  Perhaps with today's technology his performance can be excised into something else?<br/><br/>

","For anyone who has not read the book of the same title written in the 1920s I believe, permit me to disclose the following: Very little in this movie has any basis in fact. Some of the people, most notably Bill the Butcher, did exist Boss Tweed of course, but none of these events as portrayed in the film actually happened. So with that in mind, can you accept or even enjoy this movie? Depends on you I suppose. My knowledge and love of history compels me to give it very low marks. The performances are sound, most notably Lewis, and Scorsese works his patented visual magic, but the film I gotta say overall is a total bomb. Long movies are good only when long movies are entertaining. To me this was more of the same industrial opium with good set and costume. The film's message of immigrant paranoia however is a valid redeeming one, and should be heeded. But I wonder how many people will find themselves able to glean any sort of theme whatsoever once this bloodbath finally draws to a close. The history of New York is fascinating, no ciy's is moreso. One can only hope that this film inspired a few well meaning people to pick up a book and learn how it really was. Truth as always trumps fiction. Especially cheap crappy fiction."

","Great movie.  The movie was about pure vengeance and the glorification of violence.  No one in the world can present a movie like that with such greatness except for Martin Scorcese.  The violence was almost inspirational!  This movie was filled with testosterone.  Leonardo DeCaprio played a convincing tough guy even though he is skinnier than most of the girls I've dated.  Daniel Day Lewis stole the show as the ruthless baron of five points.  He was a convincing force of a character.  Beautiful Cameron Diaz kept my attention with her looks and her street-smart character.<br/><br/>The movie was a gangster movie, which is not original.  This movie was set in the 1860's, which is very original.  I have never seen a movie try to capture the crime genre during the mid-19th century.  The costume and dress of the time was visually stunning.  I think Scorcese has watched other directors use color schemes to make the movie visually stunning, because this is the first movie he has made that has coloring that stands out.<br/><br/>A lot of people say this movie was a vast exaggeration of early life in New York.  The catch phrase of the movie was `America was born In the Streets'. I have to believe that life was extremely hard and violent, and many immigrants lived in slums.  I could see people doing whatever necessary to survive, whether it is steal, cheat, murder.  Story evolved around race riots and draft riots in New York.  I watched history channel about the draft and race riots in New York, and this movie really captures the time. According to the documentary the dead rabbit riot of 1857 really killed over 100 people.  This movie tries its best to put together and recapture the frustration of living in a slum.  Even though the draft and race riots did not really happen at the same time.  The movie combines the two.<br/><br/>Bowery Boys, Plug uglies, dead Rabbits some interesting names of the gangs. 9/10, but then again I am the drunken_critic."

","Yep, I said it, and if you've seen it, you should understand why. The fact that a movie this good could not even take home one oscar out of ten nominations is unfathomable, and is indicative of the huge flaws that go towards deciding these awards. I understand that Gangs was an unpopular movie because of it's incredibly violent themes, but the sentimentality the Academy has towards movie-musicals is a ridiculous justification of how trite films like Chicago can win Best Picture. <br/><br/>And i'm not saying Gangs should have won either. In my opinion, Gangs of New York, Lord of the Rings, The Pianist, and The Hours were all far superior to Chicago in terms of artistic merit. I am even willing to concede that as a movie, Gangs is far from perfect. It doesn't always stick to the plot, and sometimes abandons the story entirely and gives a historical perspective on the era from a documentarian's point of view, sometimes good, sometimes lagging. <br/><br/>But I think we can all agree on the artistic elements of the movie. How could the costuming, set design, and overall artistic direction of the film go so overlooked?! Artistically, it was one of the most beuatiful things I had seen onscreen in a long time.

","If you don't want to see Leonardo DiCapprio in a negative review, see Gangs of New York instead of that inane tripe Catch Me if You Can. Martin Scorcese tells the tale about the turf war between Anglo-Saxons and the Irish in New York City in the 1860's.  Daniel Day Lewis should have got the Oscar for his role as the notorious, charismatic butcher who kills Amsterdam's father.  <br/><br/>   Daniel Day Lewis's performance also comes off as comical at times.  It's hard to believe that Cameron Diaz was in a horrid movie like ""A Life Less Ordinary"" to something that was Oscar worthy like Gangs of New York. Leonardo DiCapprio is the glue that holds this picture together, his performance as Amsterdam the gang leader determined to avenge his father's death was extrordinary.  I also heard somewhere that Scorcese wanted to make this movie 20-some years ago.  Gangs of New York is a movie everybody should see.  It gives a good history lesson as well."

","Where to start I have not been a huge fan of Scorsese ever since The Last Temptation of Christ debacle. It's not that I don't think that M.S. is a good director, I just think he has had some problems with casting pictures outside his tried and true NY style. I mean Harvey Keitel as Judas and Willem Defoe as Christ? Sure Willem may look the part but geez, neither of them could rid themselves of their Brooklyn/NY accents long enough to ever be convincing. The picture told a great story but I just couldn't get over that accent hill. <br/><br/>  Moving forward 15 years I thought that he may have done it again. I just didn't see Cameron Diaz fitting into a role that is set in the 1850/60's. Also, I'm not a big fan of L. DiCaprio's either. Sure he can act but I just have a hard time getting that sniveling little This Boy's Life' kid out of my mind sometimes; especially when he's supposed to be tough, I expect Robert De Niro to come waltzing in and slap him down. Anyway I think that GoNY has put some of these difficulties to rest for me. Here we have a fantastic, sweeping story about this country's, but especially New York City's, shaky beginnings and we have another classic New York story from M.S.  the thing he does the best. I didn't have problems with accents, I found the story completely engaging, the acting was top notch (of course Day-Lewis stole the show, as I'm sure everyone has mentioned) but DiCaprio really impressed me and may have dispelled the image I've had of him for so long. His character struggles with his sense of loyalty; to avenge his dead father or to the man who killed him but has taken him under his wing and shown him respect. DiCaprio really relays the emotion superbly. There are scenes in this movie that will stick with me for years, i.e.: when Jenny asks Amsterdam who he is, which makes Amsterdam ask the same of himself, which causes him to come to his resolve. Simply great storytelling.<br/><br/>  The production on this picture was nothing less than epic. It really transports you back to this country's struggle to find it's self. I found myself questioning weather any of the story was based on fact. On the DVD there is a Discovery Channel feature that put those questions to rest: most of what's in the film has some basses in historical events. Most not so flattering, but all very fascinating. If you have any interest in discovering what kind of strife our forefathers and mothers had to endure to make this country and NYC what they are today with a generous helping of great acting, directing and story telling: rent Gangs of New York and then watch the DC feature. I don't see how anyone could be disappointed."

","I had no idea GoNY was set in the 1800's, and so the film came as quite a shock to me. I had expected mafia-type action but instead I was treated with a fantastic yet dark world of betrayal and blood and an excellent black comedy. <br/><br/>The only complaint is the fact that Cameron Diaz can't act! She barely keeps her Olde American accent consistent, and looks way too thin to be authentic. And the lines they give her are laughable at best, sounding more like lines from an essay than an actual person."

","This film was saved from the toilet by the ever present net we call Lewis. A Scorcese favorite. Out of all the characters, I found Bill to be of the most intrigue. I wanted to know his life, his hardships. Lewis did an excellent job in portraying a man who worked from the foundation up. A man with honor, and morals amongst men. Sure he may have flown off the handles at a few points, but look at some of the other sides of it. I mean, the Irish finally have their candidate for Sheriff, and yes Bill does do the foolhardy thing by calling on him to fight. So Monk goes on out there and instead of just asking him to come up and talk, makes this huge appeal to the entire city. This scene was vomitorium material, and instead of feeling for he plight, it made me think of what an a$$ he looked like up there. No wonder Bill snuffed him. I didn't feel any amount of pity for DiCraprio at all. To me, Amsterdam was some kid that'd been away for so many years to come back to a world he barely knew. A fight he had never experienced. Cameron Diaz ... well, I didn't much notice her in the film. I didn't know her story much, and I just thought she was lucky Bill was puttin up with her blonde headed ways. Liam Neeson, in his brief moment, was as always, a master at his craft. He is always a man to carry a tall, respectable presence in a film.<br/><br/>To boil it all down, this film carried Lewis to new levels, meanwhile leaving all the other actors/actress' behind in the annoying cloud of flamboyance which made this movie reminscent of old Broadway. Gay Broadway. Nothing against either, but they remain on the stage. This was a set oriented piece which was more interested in drawing a viewer into the ""slang"" and the material objects, then the actual story. Story first, costuming second in my belief. Summing it up, I give Gangs of New York a 6/10. Interesting enough to keep me watching, much to annoying to see again. Let's hope Martin scores big next summer. I'd certainly love to see a Goodfellas for our generation.<br/><br/>-J-Go"

","After watching the movie and the Discovery Channel Documentary on the Gangs of New York it appears to be somewhat accurate. The movie is not necessarily a true story but was based on some actual events. <br/><br/>First, the movie was a bit too long. At almost 3 hours really the only movies that can get away with that length is Schindlers List and Titanic. This is a part of history that many many people are not familiar with.<br/><br/>
I also had a problem with some of the casting, mainly Cameron Diaz. I would have liked to see a lesser know actress-it would have made it much more realistic plus her character was not anything extraordinary that anyone else couldn't have done it. Cameron is just to big and overpaid to make anything real to life. I doubt she was worth the absurd amount she was probably paid.<br/><br/>
Daniel Day Lewis `was superb! Impressive performance. <br/><br/>I am still undecided on Leo's performance. It was okay but did not blow me away. <br/><br/>I was not sure what they were doing with the accents. I heard dialect going back and forth from a loose Irish accent to a New York accent.<br/><br/>

","This is a drawn-out story of the battle of the Irish to be accepted in NY. I mentioned drawn-out because that's its main flaw - it's too long. The story could be shortened and the film would gain by losing some footage. The acting is pretty decent throughout, though nobody is particularly outstanding in this one. The strongest performance is by Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, and he outshines both Pitt and Diaz. Overall, I'm not sorry I watched it, but I'm really glad I didn't pay more than a rental fee to see it."

","As good as the direction was, I felt that I was alternately either watching a mid 1800's version of either Mad Max or A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>The story was a fairly straight-forward revenge tale.  Unlike many other commentators, I liked the Di Caprio character and thought he did a good job (which is saying a lot for me, since Titanic is one of my most hated movies of all time and I despise anyone involved in that project) and felt D.D. Lewis was doing a bad De Niro impression the whole movie. To his credit, he was semi-creepy (mostly due to the handlebar moustache though), but whatever he was doing with his voice ... it was cheeseball.  Cameron Diaz was miscast, but I didn't mind it much since it at least gave me something to look at while I was trying to stay awake.  The plot and story were nothing to write home about, and the movie was about half an hour too long for the lack of substance it had.<br/><br/>The extreme liberties on historical accuracy also were annoying to me, especially since the movie played itself off as being at least somewhat historically accurate (for example the fades to New York in its current real state at the end of the movie, as if the two were even from the same universe much less one evolving from the other). I'm a fairly cynical member of society (left winger and an atheist), but the continual mockings of democracy, voting, value of human life, religion,etc besides just plain getting old quickly also came off as needlessly cynical untruths. If the movie was going for any real insights into early American life/thinking they failed miserably.<br/><br/>

On the plus side, I'm off now to watch A Clockwork Orange again.  Kubrick makes Martin S. look like an amateur with this type of material."

","This movie has some hallmarks of a Scorsese picture, but it lost itself somewhere during the filming.  Normally, Scorcese has a knack for keeping focus on a main theme (i.e., Casino = greed is bad; Raging Bull > out-of-control temper can get you in trouble).  However, after the first hour, Gangs of New York lost any theme and causes the viewer to just watch the movie and to not think, which is very unlike a Scorsese picture.   In addition, I would like to know when and where Leonardo DiCaprio became a movie star worthy of being in a Scorsese picture.  Perhaps it was Titanic, but his performance therein was not what made Titanic a decent film.  The guy is simply awful. In every movie that I have seen in which  he performed, he was outperformed by all his co-actors.  His acting is completely unbelievable, and his ""Irish"" accent came and went (very sloppy).  He looks like he is still 14, despite his attempt to grow facial hair. Unfortunately I have to blame Scorsese for this foul-up.  DiCaprio ruined otherwise decent performances by Lewis and Diaz.  Rating: 6/10 for Lewis's and Diaz's performances, and the wonderful lighting and costumes.  Rating without DiCaprio: 8/10.  My average rating for Scorsese pictures: 9.5/10."

","It's long, but it's the time that it needs to explain everything that Martin Scorzese wants to show us. The hate, the love, the bad and the good, the violence of the streets and the violence of politics, racism and a country that is beging its history. The first half of hour it's great and it's unbelieveble. Daniel Day Lewis is so good that you can understand that the bad is not totally bad and the good Amsterdam is not so 100% good. Scorzese put you in a wild society that it's an unbelieveble mirror of our times, he bring us in Five points and you believe that the plot and New york's history is there but at the end we understand that we cannot see only five points in our life but even watching around to understand what's going on in all your country. So if you think only about yourself you would die in that time, hard to say now what it will happend to you... perhaps a day something will fall from the sky and we don't know what it is and for which reason they are falling down. Good to know that Miramax and Scorzese chose CinecittÃ  to do the movie! So we will see if in Oscar's night it will the movie of the year. Not for me anyway!"

","This is a wonderfully lavish spectacle from maestro Martin Scorsese. The film, despite being a little overblown and overly melodramatic, is still a fantastic example of how to make a movie.<br/><br/>The film of course will be most remembered for the return of Daniel Day Lewis after 5 years out of the business and after watching it he will definitely be the lasting memory. Lewis is fantastic, he steals every scene and if he wins his Oscar its deserved. The rest of the cast are good but play second fiddle to be honest. Leonardo Di Caprio proves once again that he can act and isn't just eye candy for young females, and Cameron Diaz proves that for herself in regards of the male viewers, in fact she looks remarkably different donning a mane of curly red hair and without make up and proves that it isn't the slap (make-up) that makes her pretty, she is naturally gorgeous. Also good are Brendon Gleeson and Jim Broadbent, as ever.<br/><br/>Overall this is not Scorseses best, in fact truthfully it is one of his worst, but that siad this is still top draw stuff with fantastic production desgin, great music and stuning performances from namely mr Day Lewis in particular. As you expect from Scorsese this is very violent and bloody but its engaging stuff. ****"
"evso","7","0","1","13 January 2003"," Day-Lewis is breathtaking.
","This was my first Scorcese film, I have to admit.  Because of what I had heard about this film, I wasn't too hyped up about seeing it.  However, since I am huge Daniel Day-Lewis fan, I went to see it anyway.  It was so much better than I thought it would be.  It is not great film-making, but it is a whole sight better than a lot of the crap Hollywood has been putting out lately.  I actually got very involved in the characters and the plot until the end which I won't go into too much detail about, but is way too confusing.  I think I got the point of the film, but I am not really sure.<br/><br/>Some of the special effects were extremely cheesy, especially one shot where a man is cut by another's knife and blood spurts out his side.  Perhaps if I hadn't been watching bits from ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" the day before I wouldn't have giggled at that part, but it really is laughable. Basically, the fight scenes are corny, but they aren't the majority of the film, so you can deal with them.<br/><br/>Either way, you have to see this film if you are a Day-Lewis fan.  He owns it.  Leonardo DiCaprio is good, and Jim Broadbent is very believable as a New York politician, but they can't hold a candle to Day-Lewis.  You believe that he really lost an eye, you see his respect for the only man he killed worth remembering, and his anger at being lied to.  He is just perfect for this role, and is definitely the best thing about the film.<br/><br/>Also, I found the music entrancing.  There is music throughout the film, and the songs chosen are so wonderful.  Well, the U2 song at the end didn't do much for me, but the Civil War-era music placed throughout just fits in amazingly well.  I loved the scene of the men boxing with a hammer-dulcimer player in the room.<br/><br/>So while I think this film is far from the best of the year, it is good, and worth seeing for Daniel Day-Lewis amazing performance as Bill ""the Butcher""."
"abrownbear","9","0","1","13 January 2003"," Standard Scorcese...or simply extraordinary.
","Martin Scorcese never does what you expect, much to the joy of his many adoring fans.  Gangs of New York ranks among his most brilliant and admirable accomplishments.  A beautiful, sweeping story of love, hate, and revenge, set against the sumptuous background of Civil War era New York City is stylish, fanciful, intriguing and satisfying.<br/><br/>The plot is wonderful, and dare I say terrificly acted.  Not previously a fan of either DiCaprio or Diaz, I am now tempted to rethink my notions. If you are willing to ignore the pair's tendency to slip in and out of the accents--and this is easy to do with such rich and resonant dialogue--then you could easily say that these characters are nearly perfectly acted. One cannot help but adore DiCaprio's Amsterdam, and his onscreen chemistry with Diaz is so delightful, a moment or two will pass when you wish you were in her (or his) place.  DiCaprio successfully wins back his respectability in one harrowing performance, and I expect the future will bring more Cameron Diaz in more period costumes.  But the real show here is all Day-Lewis. Tremendously ferocious as The Butcher, his character is the stuff of nightmares, and his haunting, glass-eyed glare sends chills up your spine and raises the hair on your neck.  So frightening is his portrayal, it is difficult to understand how even a beefier, angrier DiCaprio would dare take on such a terrifying monster.  But take on The Butcher he does and the results are a story so sinister yet emotionally gripping that you know why it bears the name Scorcese.<br/><br/>Of course, it is thoroughly gruesome and bloody, so be prepared to close your eyes if you are at all squeamish, but anyone familiar with the director's work would expect this at the outset, and hey, Five Points in 1863 was a very rough place to live.  Kudos to the sound editors who make every smashed bone sound chillingly (sometimes sickeningly) realistic.  I recommend Gangs of New York to every movie lover, particularly those who have an affinity for Scorcese or for period dramas, or even war stories. Fear not the length (2:40), for every moment is justified and the time will pass in blissful absorption.  This film is captivating, thoroughly enjoyable, and destined to become a classic of film lovers and critics alike."
"LarryScott","8","0","1","13 January 2003"," Braveheart Meets Mean Streets
","In spite of the egregious miscasting of DiCaprio and Diaz, this is a significant piece of moviemaking and should not be missed.<br/><br/>Daniel Day-Lewis virtually carries this film singlehanded.  His villainous swagger, convincing (and surprising!) New Yawk accent, and brutal, in-your-face control of every scene he's in is worth the price of admission. DiCaprio, whose boyish and bland demeanor is much more suited for the teenage antihero of ""Catch Me If You Can"", is completely lost here, and could have trashed the entire film had Day-Lewis not been so strong. Diaz is about as passionate as a lamp-post and is nothing more than window dressing in a part that calls for a dark, torrid, sensual and controlling woman.  I'm surprised and disappointed that Scorcese let the casting be so shallow.<br/><br/>An interesting dichotomy in ""Gangs"" is the sets: interiors were fabulously deep, rich in detail, and convincing, while the exteriors were about as real as an MGM tour in Orlando.  It is entirely lost on me why this production schlepped to Rome to come up such backlot-looking, phony sets.<br/><br/>
But don't despair - the intelligent, historically accurate and informative script, the direction, and Lewis' tour-de-force combine to produce a film ""event"" that you should certainly see on the big screen."
"dan2058","Null","0","1","14 January 2003"," So close to being the greatest film ever made.
","I'll admit that I couldn't wait to see this film. The hype made me believe that this would be the most complete movie-experience of my life. Even without the hype I was expecting something huge due to the names involved, Di Caprio, Diaz, Broadbent, Day-Lewis and of course Scorsese. For a young sprog like me, what better way to attract me to a period drama (although if Tarantino did one it would take it a step further). From the opening scene I felt that my faith would be rewarded as Scorsese orchestrated a wonderful battle and laid the foundations of the story. Fantastically filmed and choreographed, it was exactly what I wanted from the film. However it couldn't keep up the standard that it had set so early on and the film began to drag at around the mid-point. It took far too long for Leo to be found out by Day-Lewis and even when it happened it wasn't used to it's greatest possible potential. I personally would have to liked to have seen Leo trying to live up to his father's legacy or hating himself for becoming to close to the man that killed him but it never happened. Yet even when things started to go well, I still believed that Scorsese wouldn't let me down and that I would leave the cinema on a high. It felt like it was all falling into place when Di Caprio hangs the dead rabbit on the fence, it was almost like Rocky going back into training. At this point I was sure that I would get the climatactic ending that I wanted and when the two gangs finally(it did take longer than was really necessary) marched into the streets I was on the edge of my seat. Yet I was left completely disappointed by a real sell-out ending. It had all the right ingredients to finish with the most epic ending in film history but it was more than slightly anti-climactic. This is not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie, it is well worth seeing if only for Daniel Day-Lewis' breath-taking perfomance. If he doesn't pick up an oscar it will be the greatest miscarriage of justice in the history of the planet. I was also very impressed by the end time-lapse which very cleverly brought us up-to-date and credit must be given to the set-builders who created an amazing recreation of New York. I was also overwhelmed by the amount of extras in each shot. Every shot was busy and filled with things to see. Overall Gangs of New York is still better than your average film and well worth a look but I was left empty and disappointed by the finale. I feel that it is a real shame to have wasted such potential so Gangs of New York gets itself 7/10"

","I went to see this movie with High Expectations, I thought I was going to see a Martin Scorsese work of Genius on a par with Casino or Goodfellas.... It Fails. This Is NOT a Rubbish Movie, There where parts of It I quite Enjoyed, but not many and certainly not enough to keep me watching for THREE HOURS.  The fact this was 3hrs long was not the reason I didn't like this movie, In fact many of my favorite movies (Lord Of The Rings, Dances With Wolves, Casino) where that long, The problem was that it just didn't have the pace or enough of a story to warrent that sort of screen time. Another thing that has bugged me is how over hyped this movie was. Day-Lewis was very good as Bill The Butcher BUT by no means should he win Best Actor for this role, the way he droned on sometimes made me want to get up and leave but I put this down more to the script than him. Leo was on a par with his usual stuff (I'll leave it up to you to decide if that is good or bad) and miscast in the role, he was too... well Leo for want of a better word. Diaz was as Stunning looking as always and was one of the only things worth keeping your eyes open for, her acting was OK but not her best work. All the others worked as well as they could with the material provided. My Main Gripe with this was the way the movie was padded out with so much stuff to do with the Civil War and the being Drafted into the army.<br/><br/>I realise this is a very negative review so far and I admitt the movie had its good points, the fight at the beginning was well done and the first hour looked promising but after that it justed dragged and was letdown by its end. I rated this movie a 5/10, This was mainly due to the Directing and the actors doing the best with what they had. I will close by saying that you should NOT go and see this thinking you are going to see a movie like Goodfellas or Casino or any of Martin Scorsese's best work If you do you will come out thinking the same as me."
"a_very_little_sphinx","Null","0","1","6 August 2003"," Epic, Grand, a great accomplishment, Joycean in magnitude.
","I am a writer, not a film maker, and so I am willing to overlook the ineptitudes of casting someone like Di Caprio, or even Diaz in this film, though Lewis, amazing, outstanding, he deserves all the credit accounted to him.<br/><br/>A movie is flawed unwillingly by it's casting. That is not necessarily the fault of the director. If you look back, to the half and half movie (really a movie in three parts), Full Metal Jacket was to have cast Anthony Michael Hall as ""Joker"", and you reel at the consequences.<br/><br/>The beauty of this movie, and one must take this in consideration for all films or movements of multimedia, is in the scope of the storytelling. It moves us into a realm that seems almost, well, I'm sure, quite alien to us. It is almost science fiction, it is unknown to us, rather than the grim streets of Taxi Driver, or the commonality of Raging Bull, Casino, or Goodfellas, all fine films in their own right.<br/><br/>What I say is that, this film, unlike these others I have mentioned, attempts to accomplish the history of an unknown New York. It acts as a Ulysses, a book which spans one single day, for a history which we can scarcely claim as our own.<br/><br/>I would never cast Di Caprio in any part that required the least bit of genuine threat. Di Caprio by his own nature, and not the least of his acting ability which has never quite ever reached his abilities in ...Gilbert Grape, is simply not up to the part.<br/><br/>What captivates, and what holds you to this film, as I attempt to see in any film, is the length to which reality, or a reality is attempted. It becomes real to us, it is a history to us because of this endeavor. We become the victims of fiction and fact due to the absolute attention to detail. A detail, we can only assume is real, and yet, we have no choice but to believe it; to want to believe it, and that is the magick of film making that is achieved.<br/><br/>Anyone can ruin his own birthday party by denouncing the guests, but when it is wrapt in such luxury of fiction and wonderment, and is graced by even a few characters that we may call our own Molly Bloom, to do so is to put oneself in jeopardy of missing the beauty cast by someone such as Monet. Grand in the big picture, weak in the details, yet stunning still."

","Now I haven't seen all the movies of 2002 yet; I still need to see The Hours, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and all the other smaller films that will be working their way in my direction in the next few weeks.  Right now however, Gangs of New York is the film to beat for best picture of the year. Even Peter Jackson's brilliant second chapter in his Lord of the Rings trilogy, couldn't captivate me the same way as Martin Scorsese's newest masterpiece.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect in parts; the final act seems a little scattered, but the overall film is so grand and mesmorizing, it doesn't matter if the film is slightly flawed.  Using hardly any CGI effects, Gangs of New York will probably be the last epic of this scale made the old fashioned way.  You can see in every single frame the amount of time that was spent in making this picture.  The battle scenes are extrodinary, and all the leads give their best performances to date.  Especially Daniel Day-Lewis, who is pretty much guranteed to win the Best Actor Oscar."
"ferguson-6","9","0","1","23 December 2002"," So realistic!
","Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Martin Scorcese has crafted a masterpiece epic that puts you smack in the middle of the gang wars that were a part of the foundation of our country.  The shame is many will not see this movie because some critics are panning it as too long or too hard to follow or because it has Leonardo DiCaprio or Cameron Diaz in key roles. First of all, this movie should be seen by any film lover if only to see Daniel Day-Lewis(""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" ""My Left Foot"") in his finest performance.  He is  frighteningly menacing as William Cutting, aka Bill The Butcher.  He has captured the spirit of this dreadful man, from his cocky walk to his handling of cuttlery.  His sneers and voice will send chills up your spine.  This is the best performance I have seen in a long time.  As a selfish film lover, I do wish this wonderfully talented man would work more often!  Leonardo, now cast as a 20 something man, is forced to carry much of the film, and he does an admirable job.  He does have screen presence, and I believe his acting ability is coming around.  Cameron Diaz adds chirpiness and spice to the otherwise drab life of the gang members.  Other nice performances include Jim Broadbent (""Moulin Rouge"") as Boss Tweed, Henry Thomas (""ET""), John C. Riley (all PT Anderson films) and Brandon Gleeson, who steals his scenes as Monk.  Liam Neeson also has a short, but crucial role.  Quick notes: look for Scorcese in a quick cameo, and he also cast Brandon DeSica (grandson of the great director Vittorio DeSica) as another tribute to Italian filmmaking.  Incredible sets and superb editing and soundtrack make this an incredible piece of filmmaking not to be missed."
"Quinoa1984","10","0","3","20 December 2002"," An American Epic...
","...Gangs of New York is indeed an American epic, telling not only a tale of revenge, but also a tale of a time capsule, A New York not many know about, with the Civil War always looming over.  There will be many a filmgoer that will consider Mr. Scorsese's work in Gangs of New York as rubbish, and true everyone can have their opinion on the landscape of 1963, but one must remember that the director, like in all of his films, has crafted such to as real and extent as can be shown in a 100 million dollar picture such as this.  As much as Scorsese took cues from avant garde and Italian filmmakers for much of his films, he also took cues from epics and Westerns, and to my view has crafted the best motion picture of the year, incorportating a saga of the city he came from and his themes from his previous pictures, most notably his references to Christianity (and for instance, his theme of destruction such as seen in Raging Bull, can be identified with many scenes, not least of which the climax).<br/><br/>The seeds for the revenge take place in 1846, when a battle is fought against the Irish and the ""Native"" Americans over the five points (parts of the slums of Manhattan), where in which William ""Bill the Butcher"" Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis in one of his very best roles) slays Priest Vallon, whose son, Amsterdam Vallon (played as an adult by DiCaprio) is then taken to an orphanage until he is set out in 1863, which is when the plot unfolds. Along with the skills of Scorsese he has his actors all in great shape, Day-Lewis especially, Diaz somewhat redeeming herself after The Sweetest Thing from this year, and DiCaprio shows that every now and then he can act. <br/><br/>Some may also criticize the way the history is represented, that the facts were skewed to tell a Hollywood story and isn't really credible to the story of the draft riots and the gangs of downtown.  I think that they may be missing the point, though I do defend the factuality- facts are always going to be skewed for a big budget picture just as this, the key is to look past that and see it as how they did in the sense of pure dramatization and if it doesn't come off as clownish or inane, and this is not the case for Gangs. <br/><br/>
For those looking for something insightful, daring, maybe even exhilarating, or just want to be entertained by more action after Two Towers, this is a definite pick for the holiday season.  Salud!  A++"
"jordonmcconnell","Null","0","1","21 December 2003"," Pound for pound one of the worst movies ever
","I am amazed at how people seem to be bending over backwards to find ways to appreciate this film.  Gangs is essentially a shopworn story of revenge wrapped up inside a History Channel documentary.  Trouble is, it fails on both fronts.  The classic 'prodigal son' story having been covered so many times before, Scorsese starts at a disadvantage.  Unfortunately, save Daniel Day Lewis's predictably fine performance, neither the script nor the actors provides us a reason to care this time out.<br/><br/>DiCaprio is typically mis-cast and is given surprisingly little to work with from a script excruciatingly long on character development but yet alarmingly devoid of nuance.  Anyone who has seen Gilbert Grape or The Basketball Diaries knows that he has good acting in him but we don't see it here.  Cameron Diaz is about as believable as you might expect in a shallow role that might have provided some of the missing nuance but is ultimately a distraction to what passes as plot.  Mostly she just comes off like Charlie's Angels with red hair dye. Lewis rules the film but he is forced to labor through an excessive series of scenes where he does little but sharpen his meat carving tools.  His character's sadistic qualities are established in the first 15 minutes of the film which renders at least 30 subsequent minutes of film dull and redundant.  Did Scorsese edit anything?<br/><br/>
Mostly every scene in this film is 50% too long.  When Scorses wants us to know that these thugs play poker, for example, he makes us sit through what seems like an entire game to make the point.  When DiCaprio follows Diaz across town we witness almost every step from 5 points to uptown.  When Scorsese wants us to know that Lewis and his ilk participate in Dyonesian orgies, he forces us to participate in almost every pair of bare breasts and peyote pipe puffs that his characters do.  Please, Martin get to the point. This movie could have been 1 hour 30 mins.  Easily.  Better yet, it could have been just as long but with substance.<br/><br/>In the end, Scorsese gives us a worn out rehash of filial revenge and little attention to the interesting historical aspects of the setting - althought the scenery and costumes are impressive.  A more intelligent treatment of this film would have paid close attention to the socio-economic aspects of the time first and the characters second.  This film works for hours to establish character and fails.  In the end, the audience struggles to comprehend a New York in chaos."
