","Most movies don't get to a fourth in the series these days. I loved the first one the best, and though the effects have gotten cheaper, this movie is still an enjoyable continuation, and Kate is still the best effect!"
"tucker-408","5","148","208","19 January 2012"," Just Not an Underworld Movie. . .
","This movie was, at best, mediocre. The action was good, I suppose, but it simply wasn't as good as its three predecessors. The plot was underdeveloped and unsatisfying. Also, without Speedman, it was really just missing something.<br/><br/>The story was, quite simply, lacking. It's difficult to explain this film's shortcomings without spoiling it, but, to say the least, they ignored elements that could have made a good movie and skipped to rather simple, unsatisfying plot devices. This movie was also absurdly short, testifying to its lack of content.<br/><br/>In the end, it just didn't feel like Underworld. I would compare this to the way I felt about The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, and Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides - just an out of place fourth movie of a series. I really wanted it to be good, but it just wasn't."
"wiseman987","2","98","141","21 January 2012"," Amazingly Overrated!
","I may be acting a bit rash in rating this film at 2 stars, but at the time of my writing, there are just too many shadow marketing reviews on this site to ignore. In a different situation, and if the first 2(3) underworld movies were not so good, I might rate this a 5.<br/><br/>New writers, new director/directors, different movie.<br/><br/>If you just want to see some cookie cutter CGI 'action' movie, then give this a look.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the earlier movies, if you know the story of Selene, Viktor, Corvinus, and the rest, you will be disappointed. It is not as bad as the crazy changes they made to the highlander movies, but they just decided to forget the past films and do something new. Actually they decided to rip off a few other stories, none of which were good the first four times you saw them.<br/><br/>I am not going to go into every detail of what is wrong with this movie. For the most part, it is bad because it must be compared to the earlier films in the series. It just does not compare in any way. Acting, scenery, sets, writing, story, effects, all better in prior underworlds.<br/><br/>Aside from all I have said, the production value is high, and the movie is watchable."
"Filmaholic78","7","93","138","23 January 2012"," Meh.....Okay I guess
","I'm not sure why this film seems to be getting fantastic reviews. I mean it was a good enough action flick but it didn't blow my mind. In fact it was a case of the same old stuff just done better. Brilliant to watch but not refreshing at the same time. The story was lacking in depth and character development and just felt like a filler for another sequel.<br/><br/>I don't want to be all doom and gloom about it because Kate really did kick some ass and looked good doing it too so as far as action and eye candy goes its great. But any fan of the series knows that the Underworld saga isn't stupid. They always paid attention to script and story and that was lacking here unfortunately.<br/><br/>I'm sure if you go and see it you wont be disappointed but just leave your brains at the door and watch the action commence."
"joshuasbrenner","4","38","53","4 February 2012"," Disappointing!
","I saw the movie in 2D but to be honest, the low rating was not because of the lack of 3D but rather that it was very disappointing. I felt like the movie had a good storyline but it only touched on segments of it rather than expand on it. The Cryogenics with a 12 yr gap did not make any sense. If the little girl was her daughter than how come she had no memory of giving birth. If the hybrid was a test tube baby she would have still come from somewhere, unless the female scientist who looked after the child was the real person who gave birth to her? Also, when Selene met with Thomas, he knew who she was and that she was responsible for killing elders but it didn't really touch on how he knew even though he acted like he was an elder which I do not think he was. As for me, the special effects were so/so but it was more like watching the first Matrix movie. The scene where she storms the office building and attacks the guards was very similar to scene in the Matrix. It did not really leave much for the imagination.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie where the bad guys get the upper hand and the plot of the movie, it is short lived. The ending of the movie was like when the Empire Strikes Back ended. Just when the movie was getting good, and they followed a lead to meet with her hybrid lover, the movie ended! Guess there will be another sequel! When the movie ended, I looked at my watch and realized that it was just under and hour and 1/2. There was so much more they could have done with this movie and cranked out another 20-30 minutes to complete the storyline.<br/><br/>It just seemed as if they filmed the movie in a couple of months. I do not understand how there was a budget of $70 million when the special effects seemed below par. Yet, Underworld 3, was budgeted around $35 million.<br/><br/>Naturally, Kate Beckinsale looked as sexy as ever, which probably the highlight of the movie."
"leobeckons","5","41","58","21 January 2012"," Not enough vengeance
","For those who came in late, the Underworld series is all about the eternal enmity between the non-human species of Vampires and Lycans, the latter being an evolved race of werewolves. So far, we learned all about the centuries of bloodshed, and the absolute necessity for the 2 groups never to reconcile.<br/><br/>At the heart of the narrative is Selene (Kate Beckinsale), who was once the pride and joy of the Vampire army, till she fell in love with a hybrid (part vampire part Lycan), and began to question the ethics of her tribe.<br/><br/>Underworld: Awakening begins with a new development in the world that Selene and Michael inhabit. Thus far, the inferior human species has remained unaware of the existence of the other species. Now that covens and nests have been unearthed, paranoia strikes, and annihilation of non-humans becomes military priority.<br/><br/>Selene and Michael try to leave the area by boat, but both are captured and frozen in a lab, for research. When Selene awakens, she manages to flee from her prison, only to find that it is now 12 years later. Lycans are almost extinct, there is a weapon that she has, and her enemies want it for their evil purpose.<br/><br/>This installment of the Underworld franchise has the flimsiest plot, the least talented actors (except, of course, for Stephen Rea), and the most unsatisfactory climax. In fact, this has to be the first movie of the series that leaves loyalists not clamoring for more. The premise is so incredulous (and not in a good way), that you will stop trying to comprehend the sequence of events that leads Selene to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>To make up for the lack of a credible story, the makers decided to intersperse every second conversation with visuals of ripped heads, severed body parts and plenty of blood. The gore in the movie is not only irrelevant, but also added for shock value, or so it seems.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake is the presence of constantly flickering lights. The lab has them, the parking lots have them, the corridors have them - the civilized world does not seem to believe in proper lighting. What the audience is left with is a semi-hypnotized sense of being after sitting through all those lights.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale goes through all the motions of being Selene with the ease of a professional. She has done this to perfection before, but this time, she seems complacent, and bored. To give her credit, she has maintained her figure, and looks no different than the Selene who first made an appearance almost a decade ago (in the first movie of the series).<br/><br/>The very talented Stephen Rea plays a villain of sorts in the movie. He does look confused at times, as if he wonders why he signed the film. There is no sign of effort from any other member of the cast.<br/><br/>The music is more like stock music, and production value is inconsequential (there's nothing in the film except walls and piers). The fight sequences are not engrossing enough, and the spurting blood and flying intestines are distracting.<br/><br/>In short, the entire movie is a disappointment. If, however, you insist on watching Underworld: Awakening, avoid the 3D version, and maybe your headache will not be as bad.<br/><br/>On a more positive note, there is always the hope that the next movie will manage to regain the lost glory of the series."
"Marter2","6","59","88","20 January 2012"," Doesn't Feel the Same, But Still an Enoyable Action Flick
","When details finally came out about ""Underworld: Awakening,"" my heart sunk a little. True, the second installment wasn't very good, and the third was a prequel, but I was still looking forward to seeing further adventures of the vampire, Selene (Kate Beckinsale). As it turns out, she's the only returning cast member. Everyone else is gone from the project, leaving her the one tie to a series (seemingly) well past its prime. ""Awakening"" also clocks in at under 90 minutes, making the first film's two hours seem like days in comparison.<br/><br/>The plot this time around is told to us in the form of exposition. After ""Evolution,"" humans discovered that lycans (werewolves) and vampires exist, and decided to wage war against both mythical creatures. They decided that genocide was the only option, and all but wiped out both species. So, how did Selene manage to survive? Well, she was captured by some scientist folks who decided to keep her alive, but frozen, for the past twelve years. Michael (previously portrayed by Scott Speedman), her vampire-lycan hybrid lover, has presumably died.<br/><br/>So, you'll be unsurprised to find out that Selene eventually escapes from her prison, fits back into that catsuit that she has grown accustomed to, and begins trying to find out just what the world has become in her absence. Of course, she still believes that Michael is still alive, so she sets out on a quest to find him. Meanwhile, she's also getting random visions flashing in front of her. It turns out, as anyone who has seen Evolution will have assumed, she has given birth to a daughter, Eve (India Eisley), and the two are linked via their sight. She can see what Eve can see if they are close to one another.<br/><br/>The villain this time around is the head of the scientists, a man named Jacob (Stephen Rae). I suppose the humans are also the bad guys, as they want to kill any vampire they come across, although the one human whose name we learn, a detective named Sebastian (Michael Ealy), ends up helping Selene. She's also eventually joined by another vampire, David (Theo James). Lycans also still exist, and they end up becoming more frequent as the film progresses after a plot twist is revealed that you'll probably see coming from a mile away, if you haven't already guessed it.<br/><br/>There isn't really a central plot that's worth discussing. ""Underworld"": ""Awakening's"" screenplay reads as both lazy and very loose. It's hard to even reflect back on it and try to remember key moments. It doesn't care about secondary characters (they're plot devices), and it doesn't care for its main one all that much either, although Beckinsale's Selene does have to show a tad bit more emotion than in previous installments. But not much more.<br/><br/>Essentially, we're here for the action scenes, which serve both as the main material as well as the glue that holds it together. In what is probably the most action-packed and gory iteration in this series, ""Underworld"": ""Awakening"" certainly doesn't have many boring moments. There's no substance to the plot or characters, but if you're watching the fourth ""Underworld"" film, chances are you don't care about that kind of thing. You're here to see Kate Beckinsale in a tight leather catsuit running around, doing flips off walls, shooting at anything that moves, and doing it all with a blue tinge. You get that with ""Awakening.""<br/><br/>Initially, I couldn't quite put my finger on why I still didn't have a great time with this film. It did most of the things it needed to right, and was overall quite exciting. But it lacked substance, and I don't just mean in its story and characters. Even at its worst point (""Evolution""), the ""Underworld"" series has always maintained some depth to the world that the characters inhabit. An entire back story was mapped out, and we understood the history of both supernatural clans. ""Awakening"" seems dedicated to both ruining and ignoring all of that previous work.<br/><br/>Here is a film that's premise involves the destruction of the majority of both species' members. Presumably, artifacts and historical documents were also destroyed, rendering much of the back story unknown to the survivors. Those who do know, like a man named Thomas (Charles Dance), have no proof of it and have no need to bring it up. The world is no longer an ""Underworld"" one; instead, it's just a generic action movie with vampires and werewolves. All of the work that went into the crafting of this universe is destroyed with ""Awakening."" It almost seemed like directors Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein went with this story just so that they didn't have to include any depth, even if that depth is what made ""Underworld,"" well, ""Underworld.""<br/><br/>Maybe I'm overthinking things. Like I said, you're watching ""Underworld: Awakening"" to see Kate Beckinsale in a bunch of physics-defying action scenes while dressed in her character's signature leather outfit. You get that here. The action scenes are slick and well-made, the lycans look better than they ever have before, and the ending sequence, involving at least three distinct battles, is satisfactory, even if the ending as a whole promises much more than it delivers. I did have a good time, even if this installment completely ignores all of the history and back story of its universe. This is a movie for the ""Underworld"" fans. If you're one of them, you'll have a good time here. Newcomers will want to start at the beginning. If you aren't a fan, this one has less depth and more action than earlier iterations, so make your decision accordingly."

The film's release date is on the same day as Underworld: Evolution's, released six years earlier. The picture continues the characteristic of the series that the major supporting parts are played by well-known actors from the UK, in this case Charles Dance and Stephen Rea . Furthermore , there appears uncredited Wes Bentley . And is the first Underworld film not to feature Bill Nighy, Michael Sheen or Brian Steele . It packs large loads of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount , several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with arcs . Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck and the breathtaking fighting scenes are realized with magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department . The film blends horror, suspense, struggles, rip-roaring action, terror and lots of blood and gore . Set design is of first class , settings are stylized, Gothic scenarios , and spooky and ghoulish atmosphere. Special effects are breathtaking , part of them are made by means of computer generator and part by make up . Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Paul Haslinger and colorful and dark cinematography by Scott Kevan ; being the first film in the series to be in real-d 3-d and Imax 3-d . Spectacular and moving direction by Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein , though Jalmari Helander was offered a chance to direct. The interesting but mediocre screenplay was written by Len Wiseman , Kate Beckinsale's husband , who directed the former entries , along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux . All actors and technicians participated in the previous outings , including , of course , Kate Beckinsale as a relentless action woman , being well replaced by Rhona Mitra in former entry titled ¨Rise the Lycans¨. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general."
"al-russell","3","51","78","21 January 2012"," Action over writing (spoiler free)
","I'm generously giving this movie 3 stars simply because Kate Beckensale is so very hot in a black cat suit and because the action was impressive. Unfortunately, the writing was seriously lacking, which is pretty sad since I didn't go in with terribly high expectations in the first place. Without giving away any spoilers, the story was virtually non-existent. I'm not saying to avoid this movie altogether, just to know what you're getting onto, lots of flash and next to no substance. This is NOT on par with the original Underworld, nor Rise of the Lycans. Even Evolution was better, and that was pretty forgettable. Kate, however, continues to impress as Selene, though her age will belie her vampire nature soon if they keep making sequels. The amount of makeup on her face was actually distracting in this film, especially since there was no time set aside between beat downs for her to apply Ru Paul style cake. But, these are small matters. The real issues are related to the story itself and I'm trying to avoid mentioning specifics. Speedman's absence was sorely felt too, despite the infusion of a new piece of beefcake for the ladies."
"mgelliott1","2","55","85","21 January 2012"," Very disappointed
","I was excited when I found this movie was coming out. I saw all 3 movies again on DVD 2 times each to be fully prepared. I saw the movie right when I got off work on opening night (no matinée pricing, extra for 3D), and I was sorely disappointed. The 3D technology used all the gimmicks that I hate about 3D such as things flying at the screen. That is soooo 1950s. Parts of the 3D near the beginning made it look like I was watching a cartoon or some kind of animation. The inclusion of ""humans"" in the main story line really mucked this movie up. The other 3 movies were much more interesting in learning and understanding the cultures and issues between the Lycans and Vampires in this ""Underworld"" that humans knew nothing about. If you are going to go above ground, if Selene is now a day-walker thanks to Alexander Corvinus, if humans are involved, it is no longer an ""Underworld"" is it? Possible spoilers coming. I liked the new male vampire lead David for himself, but felt him playing against Selene made her look like a cougar even though there was no romantic interactions between the two. Don't get me wrong, she looked SUPER hot as usual, but he was way too young (or young looking) to be her male lead. The storyline seemed to have themes of every action and/or futuristic movie I have ever seen. This movie series should be like a serial, an evolving storyline, not more, bigger, badder to try to get butts in the seats. I enjoyed getting to know the previous characters, but sadly almost ALL of them are gone. I never got to know the new characters too well because the writing, directing and/or editing sucked. A Black cop? What a cliché. Black characters were used effectively in the previous films, but the cop in the new film was a mistake. Also the cop helping out the criminal, human killing vampire (just because she's hot) is also a cliché. Cops never abandon their responsibilities for fat smelly biker looking criminals with big hearts. Additionally, the cop was a known actor. This is a gimmick. They may as well should have added Sean Connery or Liam Neeson. Great actors, but gimmicks. Just like when Jessica Biel and Ryan Reynolds showed up in the 3rd Blade series. Selene is a death dealer killing Lycans. I was surprised when she killed certain people in the movie like when she dropped the guy out the window who SAID he'd saved her (she did not know at the time that he was lying). Also Selene was WAY more acrobatic (in terms of frequency and physical ability than the previous movies), I did not like this. The Godzilla sized Lycan was ridiculous. They never fully explained what/why was going on in the laboratory. There was inconsistency (in the other movies too) in the fact that when Selene shoots Lycans with bullets, they die. However, everyone else must use silver bullets? Shooting the floor of the elevator about to crash down on her? Rip off of movie 1. First, why did she not just get out of the shaft if she is THAT fast. Secondly, even though the floor was shot out that DID NOT (or should not) stop the circular disk from crashing into her and smashing her. If her skeletal structure is strong enough to withstand this, then what's the need to shoot out the floor. In fact, if she is immortal, other than sunlight (which no longer affects her), why the need to shoot the floor out of the elevator at all. In fact, if she IS a day-walker, like Michael how did they ever become known to the police. the story points out that the police were dragging people into daylight to see if they would burn. Michael and Selene do not have this issue. Michael can change at will. Wouldn't they just blend in and never be discovered? Finally, where are these movies supposed to take place? Hungary? Eastern Europe. Selene speaks a foreign language in this and other movies, but now she is suddenly in the United States with no explanation?. Where and why did she ever learn English in the first place.Oh...the daughter. According to IMDb she is turning NINETEEN this year! So much for playing a 12 year old.<br/><br/>The movie felt short and it also felt like a total setup for the next film which we'll have to wait, how many years for? Maybe never if enough folks don't go to see this. I like this series and will see the next one. True fans won't pass this by either. However, new fans keep things going. I doubt they'll be back.Note to the producers, for underworld 4 PREVIEW the script and the movie with the real fans, the folks that have seen the other 3 movies multiple times, not a bunch of tourists walking around Burbank looking for free passes."
"serbian_007","3","245","420","20 January 2012"," VERY BAD storyline, Very bad film, Very disappointed!
","I LOVED the first three Underworld movies, but in all honesty ""Underworld: Awakening"" was for me a complete disaster. The first three movies were amazing because they made you think deeply about history, love, hatred, war, friendship, family, and other riveting themes; they encouraged critical thinking and connection making skills with all the powerful flashbacks and twists and turns that were within a strong plot-structure. But ""Underworld: Awakening"" failed to do any of these things. <br/><br/>The plot absolutely sucked; there's nothing original, and I don't even know what the point/theme was at all. Yes there are a few good twists in the movie, but they happen in like the last 30 minutes, and even here all we get to see is action and no real depth or explanation of the who, what, where, when, why, how? of the story. If humans are now the common enemy, then why on sam hill are vampires and werewolves still fighting? It doesn't make sense. Near the end, just as the story was getting good, I suddenly noticed the credits popping up. The movie was over. I thought, ""Huh? It can't be over, it was just getting good!?"" The film was also WAY too short. All of this taken together makes ""Underworld: Awakening"" more like an added TV episode than a major motion picture. I honestly can't believe 70 million was spent on this cop out. It would have been much better if they actually showed the fight between humans and vampires and focused on that instead of going back to a now pointless feud between vampires and lycans.<br/><br/>WHAT made ""Underworld: Awakening"" worse was the fact that the directors did not really connect this sequel to the other 3 Underworld movies: where are the flashbacks? Where's the dialogue? What exactly happened to the other characters in the earlier films, etc, etc? I know this will disappoint all of you die-hard fans like me who love the other movies, but truth hurts: the film was terrible.<br/><br/>The storyline was the worst part, I think. In the 1 hour and 30 minutes of the film, only about 20-30 minutes is spent actually talking. Selene only opens her mouth a few times, and nobody makes longer speeches which made the other movies great. If the film was really about Selene waging war against humans (which it wasn't) it would have been much better and an interesting story, but that wasn't the true plot at all.<br/><br/>To the Producers: ""It was the STORY that made the Underworld series a success, not the action, but you failed to see that. Because there is VERY little dialogue in this one and A LOT of action, there is very little story here, which makes it very unlikely that ANYONE will remember this movie after watching it. If you want to make another Underworld movie, focus on the story, on speeches, on the intellect, on actual acting instead of crappy action I can see for free on a TV series."" I hate to say this because I am such a huge fan of the series, but ""Underworld: Awakening"" is utterly forgettable. I was really disappointed, and if you're an Underworld fan you will be too. I don't think I'll watch it a second time.<br/><br/>My Objective Vote: 3/10<br/><br/>P.S. I think the people who rate this film more than a 5 either haven't watched the other Underworld films, were paid-off, or are insane. It just doesn't deserve anything more than a pass."
"mad-bout-movies","3","15","20","16 February 2012"," What just happened?
","!MAJOR SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I made a complete fool of myself when recommending this movie to my wife on the basis that the other Underworld movies were very good. My personal favourite being Rise of the Lycans. After about 15 minutes into this movie I realised it was completely disconnected from the other Underworld movies. The story is all over the place, I watched with disillusion as the movie went from one moment to many years later skipping all the sub plots that would have actually made a good movie, such as the war between humans, Lycans and Vampires. We just jump straight into a time when vampires are on the edge of extinction and Lycans are all but gone from the world. But even this is contradicted, if humans were so effective at wiping out Lycans and Vampires then how come an ultra secret top of the government organisation is run by the Lycans?!?! <br/><br/>Then there's the action sequences which IMHO were only added to be visually appealing, they didn't appear to move the story in any direction. There are times when Kate B empty's two of three clips on Lycans at close range and fails to even stop them approaching and then other scenes where she pops off three rounds from vast distances while sliding across the floor or jumping off walls and every single shot hits the 3 bad guys in the head. <br/><br/>These types of inconsistencies in both the action sequences and the story is what makes this a stand alone Underworld movie not deserving of the franchise. I was shocked by the 7.1 rating but I guess if you like watching a movie while parking your brain in your popcorn then you might enjoy it, if you've seen and enjoyed the other movies I suspect you may well find it incredibly disappointing."
"MBunge","4","18","25","23 January 2012"," Time to put a stake in it
","So, 6 years after the last time Kate Beckinsale donned a leather corset to play vampire warrior Selene and after making a 3rd edition of the franchise without her, the folks behind Underworld come back with a 4th go round which really does nothing more than prove they probably should have left well enough alone after the 2nd movie. With four people credited for the screenplay, it's not exactly a surprise to find Awakening is the worst written film of the lot and the addition of 3D can't disguise the fact that there's nothing visually new or interesting here. If you're a big fan of these films, you might just barely find this one to be passable. If you enjoyed the original, which was a good and solid little fantasy action flick, but noticed the decline in quality of the sequels, you'll find the pattern continuing here.<br/><br/>As the motion picture begins, the existence of vampires and Lycans has been uncovered by humanity and the result has been all-out war against the ""infected"". You think that'd be kind of a big deal and take the story in some new direction, but it's nothing more than a plot device. Selene and her hybrid vamp/werewolf lover Michael (not Scott Speedman) get attacked and Selene wakes up from suspended animation 12 years later in a lab. She thinks Michael is the one who freed her but it turns out to be their hybrid daughter (India Eisley) and no, they never even make an attempt to explain where the daughter came from. With the help of a human cop (Michael Ealy) and a new vampire sidekick (Theo James), Selene has to save her daughter. Not from the humans but from a Lycan scheme to create new super-werewolves, which sort of gets back to the whole plot device nature of humans knowing about the denizens of Underworld. It's not a new beginning for the series or anything like that. It's just the hook they needed to get this production off the ground.<br/><br/>If you saw Beckinsale in the first two Underworld movies, there's nothing here that will surprise you. Frankly, part of this film get dangerously close to outright fan fiction, such as when Selene revives in the lab and finds her traditional leather outfit just waiting for her to put back on. I mean, what scientific purpose was served by keeping her clothes around for 12 years? Beckinsale looks damn good, shoots a bunch of stuff and there's plenty of CGI Lycans and slo-mo action scenes. If that's all you want, have at it.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good story, even one only as good as the first or second parts of the franchise, don't bother. Underworld wasn't exactly Shakespeare but by fantasy action standards, it was a reasonably intelligent and well put together tale. The sequel was a bit too wrapped up in its own mythos, but was still functional. The third movie was strictly by-the-numbers, though it did flip the dynamic by making the Lycans more heroic than the vampires. However, Underworld: Awakening is a morally confused mess.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why the ""vampire as hero"" thing works is by being very circumspect about the whole ""needing to feed on human blood"" thing. By downplaying that, vampires change from menacing predators to really cool hipsters with super-powers. So, the original Underworld largely removed humans from the equation and focused on the werewolf vs. vampire conflict and put Selene in the role of heroine by defending the only major human character in the story. She then uncovered and rejected the villainy of her own bloodsucking kind, cementing Selene's moral and narrative virtue. Selene may have been a vampire but she never seemed to need to feed on humans and was mostly on our side. That dynamic continued in the 2nd flick and the third cast vamps as medieval tyrants facing a courageous Lycan rebellion where, again, humans were largely left out of the fight.<br/><br/>Underworld: Awakening opens with Selene slaughtering a score of human soldiers and then kills some more when she escapes from the lab, including chomping a guy on the neck and feasting on his blood. She's not a good guy who's trying to protect people from bad guys. She's an at best morally neutral creature who's only trying to survive and the viewer is expected to side with her out of nothing more than misanthropic contempt for your fellow human beings. This film assumes there's something wrong with normal people trying to protect themselves from supernatural monsters but never explains what that is. It also doesn't help that the plot is one of those multi-writer efforts where different bits from different versions of the script wind up jammed together on screen. There are too many characters and too many scenes that should have been cut out or significantly changed.<br/><br/>There are so few female-driven movie franchises that it's a shame to see this one swirl down the toilet bowl. Beckinsale and the first Underworld deserved the attention and success they got, but it's time to drag these movies out into the sunlight and let them burn up so we can all move on."

","Having just watched Underworld Awakening and not being an avid fan of the previous films in the series (not watching them), my stance on this film may not be as accurate as to those whom have seen the entire films in chronological order. However then I am reviewing this film based on this one solely. I thoroughly enjoyed, found the action top notch, well directed and fast paced. I know some of the complaints are due to the thin story but I did not mind too much. Yes a better story could have made the film better but I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship and how and what they had to do in order to save her, and her whole escape plan. Kate Beckinsale is great as Selene as well as the other supporting actors. The Lycans and vampires were an interesting take in this, as well as the final scene involving Selene having to fight the giant Lycan. The 3D was believable and so were the gimmicks. For an action movie, it delivers."
"grierjs","3","13","18","5 February 2012"," I am very disappointed.
","There was a time when I like the Underworld series. The first one had a good plot, solid acting, and added something to the mythos, even as it borrowed from the White Wolf universe. The second one was... tolerable at best. It was worth watching, at least, which is more than I can say for Rise of the Lycans. That was a total waste of time.<br/><br/>Despite the general downhill trend, I decided to check this one out in the theater. Boy, was that a waste! If the writers couldn't come up with a better villain than a steroid abusing werewolf, they need to go back to the drawing board. There are so many things they could have done with this scenario. We could have seen the Abominations come to the forefront, for one, as their strengths would have made them very difficult for the humans to kill.<br/><br/>Instead we see the Lycans taking the place of the Vampires (which I thought was alright, except for the whole Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Werewolf bit), the Vampires have all turned into a bunch of little sniveling wimps, and we are once AGAIN left wondering just what the hell is the Abomination even doing in the movie!! Yeah, I said it! The Hybrid is supposed to be some kind of immensely powerful beast capable of taking down even an elder vampire. This is something referenced multiple times throughout the series, and yet every time a hybrid gets into a fight, they get their head stomped in! In the first movie, Michael got smacked down by the elder, who is later killed by (da da DAH!) Selene. In the second movie, Michael once again gets punked, but at least he made one kill before the day is once again saved by (dah dah DAH!) Selene! Now in this, the fourth in the series, presumably focused on the hybrids, Michael gets punked even worse right at the start! They could have had him at least take out a few of the guys coming after him before he got knocked on his backside and put on ice! Sure, the little girl does alright. No better than Michael ever did, but at least she got a kill in her first screen outing. It seems to me that the only tough characters in these films are the females.<br/><br/>My point is this: if the hybrids are supposed to be the ""future,"" and the Lycans and Vampires are both scared to death of them, WHY don't we see more of their abilities?! Why are we left disappointed time and time again? Why do the writers insist on making the hybrids do little more than turn blue and roar a few times before getting the crap beat out of them? If you writers have nothing better to do with the hybrids, TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SERIES. They are, to this point, little more than a near worthless sidekick, and they add almost nothing to the story outside of being the target for aggression from both sides.<br/><br/>I gave the film 3 starts because it at least had good special effects. Beyond that, it's a flop. Predictable plot, mediocre fight scenes, and a villain that made me think Bruce Banner had been bitten by a werewolf. If this is the direction the series is headed, I am done with it."
"intp","4","8","10","30 May 2012"," A big letdown from the original three with one serious plot hole
","I'm a fan of the original three Underworld movies, having bought all three on DVD, which I have watched several times each. After initially watching the third one, which I particularly liked, the first thought that occurred to me was, ""I hope they make a fourth one"". When I heard the announcement that # 4 was in the works, I was excited.<br/><br/>But to my disappointment, this movie was too much flash and too little substance. The fight scenes were moderately enjoyable but the storyline was just too thin. The 12-year gap, in particular, was a poor idea IMO. I, and I suspect other viewers of the original three movies, wanted to see what happened just after ""Evolution"". Also, unlike the first three movies, which developed an interesting back story and mythology about the two clans, this one was just one action scene after another, with too little character development and no substantive development of the mythology at all.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I still liked seeing Kate Beckinsale in action again. But my enjoyment was seriously dampened by one major plot hole, which makes it hard for me to re-watch this movie.<br/><br/>There are, of course, many plot holes, which have been discussed in other reviews. But the one plot hole that bothered me the most (and, surprisingly, I have been unable to find any discussion about it elsewhere), is the fact that, when Selene breaks free from Antigen at the beginning of the movie, all of the security guards (as well as the scientists she encounters) are human, even though, toward the end of the movie, nearly 100 percent of the staff appears to be Lycan. This illogical discrepancy was really hard to ignore.<br/><br/>I initially rationalized this discrepancy by the idea that Antigen, not wanting to reveal their ""big secret"" to the outside world, mostly used a human staff, particularly when dealing with any threat that could not be contained within the facility (where the risk that the general public could learn that the building was a Lycan haven would be a serious concern, particularly if dead Lycan bodies were found by the police, and/or observed by passersby). But that idea got thrown out the window by the fact that, when Selene openly attacks the facility near the end, virtually all of the guards-- including those outside the facility-- openly reveal themselves to be Lycans right away. And what happened to all of the human staff at the end? (The only human in the entire facility at the end appeared to be the one unfortunate woman scientist).<br/><br/>Maybe this shouldn't have bothered me so much, but it just seemed like nonsensical writing so that Selene wouldn't discover, at the outset, the ""big plot twist"" that Antigen was nothing more than a Lycan front, and intrusively makes the viewer realize how poorly thought out this story was, even though Len Wiseman is credited on the screenplay. Also makes it tough to re-watch without wondering, ""why the hell is the entire staff human?"" at the beginning.<br/><br/>If they end up doing a fifth one, I am hoping it will be more in the vein of the original three, with better, more thought-out writing and a stronger storyline."

","No Michael, just some crazy kid who looks like a girl from 'The Curse'. Only one kiss (in flashback!), one semi-Sexy naked Selene scene, and that's all 'eroticism' in there. The whole script was probably like 10 pages and half of it was pain grunts. The police, the time frame, the afraid vampires - poor confused story. Bloody, some killing methods were hilarious. 3D worked really well with all the jumping, walking on walls, blood on camera, fire, etc. They left the story very open at the end and that's why it felt like an episode of a TV show also the movie seemed very short, expect more Underworld movies if this one makes profit.

","Like most here, I'd have to say that I was pretty excited to see a new Underworld coming to the screen. My excitement was quickly snuffed out by disappointment from the very beginning and all the way up through the very end. This movie was full of undesirable 3D gimmicks, poor and sloppy use of CGI, and a weak story line. Once again, we've been given a film that was quickly thrown together for an additional squeeze on the franchise name, and a final milking of the of a reasonable fan base. This film didn't last more than 1.5 hours, leaving the audience with an underdeveloped story line and cast of characters. I wasn't too happy with a majority of the character selections. No one seemed to fill their role well. The acting/directing was mediocre at best. As for the CGI, many of the scenes seemed like a under-budgeted video game rather than a well designed special effect. Rest assured, this film will not win any awards and we've probably seen the last installment as this film just seemed as though it was coming for it's last breath of air before going under completely. At best, you can add this one to the long list of pop-corn entertainers best viewed on a rainy day when nothing better is available to do."
"srsachan","9","103","198","20 January 2012"," Very fast paced action! Loved it!
","Well! I loved the movie as I was entertained! Isn't that is why we watch movies, for me movies should be entertaining first whether they can satisfy the critic's or not. This part is very fast paced u never get bored for a minute, its is action truly underworld style. Sometimes its very hard for me to believe that how movies like twilight(Boring love story and action nothing to speak of) work so well at the box office and underworld doesn't. Maybe its a personal choice of viewers. But if i have to rate vampire movies i would certainly rate Underworld(any part) higher than any of the twilight movies. Overall this movie is for those who liked previous parts of this movie! So enjoy the confrontation between VAMPIRES, LYCHANS AND now HUMANS!"

","Popcorn bonanza as the Underworld series passes by in a whirl of effects driven action. Kate Beckinsale returns as super sexy - latex wearing - vampire Selene, after having skipped the third movie, here added into the mix is that Selene is searching for her hybrid daughter, while the pesky humans are intent on wiping out all vampires and lycans.<br/><br/>Cue carnage. The story is very slight, the script equally so, where pretty much all roads lead to another action scene. So Selene leaps about a lot amongst blood, brains and beasties, the later of which fronted by a new giganticus hulkus werewolf. No actor in the film is asked to stretch their acting chops, but for fans of the series and action junkies in general, this is undeniably a good fun movie. 6/10"

","I quite recently discovered the underworld franchise. Generally not that fond of the fantasy genre, I liked the first 3 movies because they had something fantasy movies often lack; a good story.<br/><br/>Watching this fourth episode I was very disappointed.

There's not even a connection to the previous episodes.<br/><br/>My advice is: stay away from this movie.

","I just joined this site today purposely to write this review. This movie was incredible! I haven't seen so much action packed into a vampire movie ever. It's the best movie I have seen since HUGO and it was just great. I was at the edge of my seat in so many of the fight scenes. Selene is back and stronger, faster and more kick ass than ever. The movie is just great. I hope all fantasy, action and adventure directors take notice of what happened. I didn't think the script was all that great but the action sure made up for it and the story was decent too. I can't wait till the next one. By the way don't waste your money on the 3D. It is not that noticeable and the movie is a dark movie anyways so it was just a waste to see it in 3D but other than that the movie is so good. I had no idea how great it was. The smile on my face when I left the movie and even during the fight scenes was nuts. I can't wait to see this again and then own it on blue ray! Anyone who doesn't like the movie clearly wasn't seeing what I witnessed. Again I can't wait to see this again. I'm excited because not many movies make me want to buy the tickets again and throughout the whole movie I kept thinking this is a great start for 2012 movies should start. Oh and Kate Beckinsale looked even better in this movie than the rest!"
"gotmuch1","10","101","203","20 January 2012"," Amazing movie
","I have been a big fan of all the underworld movies. I believe the story is amazingly well played and its never a ""you are left wanting more"" film. I have read a few reviews of this film from people saying that it lacks story line/plot. Which I cannot believe. Every Underworld movie brings something new to the scene. One review said there was a 'dull' breakout intro kinda feeling like 'resident evil' style. First off, this is incredibly wrong. This movie (and all other underworlds) LACKED any dullness. Yes, Kate Beckinsale is incredibly gorgeous eye candy and the effects were amazing. But I'm not entirely sure where someone can come off and say this lacked story. In my opinion, the people saying this are people who think ""Jessica's body"" had a good story line. Underworld always leaves it off with such a twist or an ending that leaves so much room for whatever and has the potential to go in any direction. This movie was well played and directed. People saying they 'didn't get the little girl thing' obviously didn't pay attention to dialog or the EXPRESSION on Selenes face. Please, if you are a fan of underworld, or Kate Beckinsale, don't miss out on an amazing film because some people can't understand something that's not spelled out in perfect cliché. Cliché... something Underworld has yet to bring to the table. Awesome job everyone. Keep it up."
"fmelihy","1","55","106","15 February 2012"," Thanks a lot
","Really thanks a lot for the makers of this movie. Couldn't imagine more to ruin the reputation of a good trilogy. I think, even these modern video games' in game videos are far better than this movie.<br/><br/>There was no ""oh what comes next?"" question in my head. Just watched meaningless fights. You were getting excited while watching the fights in former series. There is no need to talk about characters who toss cars around like toys and can't even break the wall. Selene's and the werewolves final fight was really stupid. Selene who did unbelievable things just waited in the corner of the room like a cat. The big bad wolf was just tossing Selene around. <br/><br/>Even if I would consider this movie as not a sequel, it still would be an under average scored one. <br/><br/>Maybe it would be harsh but I would consider Underworld: Awakening in the same category of Twilight Saga for being a bad vampire&werewolf movie."

","I love all the Underworld movies. Awakenings was okay, but not great. There was a lot of action, but there were a lot of missing details and chronologically it did not make sense. If Selene was pregnant, she would have known it. It seems to me that the uprising against the lycans and vampires did not happen straight after the last movie. There would have been a lag in time. Also, if her daughter was cloned, the writers did not explain any of that. Also, just even alittle bit more of the history before mankind started to ""cleanse"" the world would have made more sense. The other movies were much better than this one at giving more detail. It appears as though Michael is back and that there will be a next Underworld as per the ending of this movie."
"poolandrews","5","6","8","4 March 2012"," Stylish & cool but empty & soulless.
","Underworld: Awakening starts as the existence of Vampires & Lycans living amongst humanity has been exposed, the authorities respond by carrying out a mass purge in order to wipe out both the Vampire & Lycan species. Vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) & her hybrid lover Michael Corvin attempt to escape the mass execution & meet at a dock but both are shot & fall into the water, Selene wakes up twelve years later in the labs of a company called Antigen after being placed in cryogenic suspension. Selene manages to escape Antigen & meets another Vampire named David (Theo James) & a young hybrid girl named Eve (India Eisley) who are all attacked by Lycans but manage to reach the relative safety of a secret community of Vampires hiding on the outskirts of the city, Selene quickly realises that Eve is her daughter & that she is crucial to genetic Lycan experiments that will give them invulnerability & will stop at nothing to get her back. Selene must fight the Lycan threat, save Eve, herself & humanity from the vicious Lycans...<br/><br/>Directed by the Sweedish duo of Måns Mårlind & Björn Stein this is the fourth film in the franchise that started with Underworld (2003) & was followed by the direct sequel Underworld: Evolution (2006) which happens to be my favourite Underworld film (hey, I have it on Blu-ray...) after which came Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009) which was a prequel & didn't feature Kate Beckinsale as Selene. For Underworld: Awakening the script jumps back to contemporary times in a modern almost futuristic city & Kate Beckinsale returns as the sexy rubber clad Vampire Selene, I must admit to liking the Underworld series as each film is visually good with some good action & gore set-pieces & although the mythology isn't exactly deep a world of Vampires & Werewolf monsters fighting each other provides ample opportunity for various cool action scenes, huge monsters, plenty of violence & gore &, of course, Kate Beckinsale in tight black PVC & rubber kicking ass. Hey, what can I say? I am easily pleased. The major disappointment about Underworld: Awakening is the lack of any substantial story on which to hang the set-pieces & action, the script is really simplistic with none of the character's standing out or being developed beyond broad clichés (character's who want to fight, character's who want don't, an evil scientist) & the plot feels a little bit choppy with the beginning in particular feeling like it could have been expanded & explained a little better. The plot about genetic experiments & Selene having to save her daughter is standard fantasy film stuff & even the concept of the Vampire & Lycan war exposed to humanity is nothing special or that original although I suppose it will take the series in a different direction if any further sequels materialize. Underwolrd: Awakenings is also very short, if you ignore the closing credits (which last for ten minutes!) then the films runs for a mere 75 minutes, I think the film could have used an extra five or ten minutes worth of character & plot development to flesh things out a little actually so it doesn't quite feels as soulless as it does & we then might have actually cared about the people here & what was going on a bit more. The twist at the end & the revelation of what the evil Lycans are trying to do is strictly routine & raises minimal interest & things are predictably left open ended to facilitate a further sequel.<br/><br/>Filmed & released in 3-D which is a trend doing the rounds in Hollywood at the moment I cannot comment on this version, I have eye problems that prevent me from seeing films in 3-D so I don't know how it looks but even I could see several scenes shot in a way with 3-D in mind. Visually I love the way Underworld: Awakening looks, it's dark grey & blue colours & it's modern yet Gothic looking sets that are impressive to look at & add lots of character to the film. The fight scenes are good, there's plenty of slow motion, shoot-outs, fights, all sorts of flips & somersault's while the CGI computer effects are also generally very good. There's a really good scene in which Selene, David & Eve are trying to escape some Lycans while driving a van & the Lycans chase them through the city traffic. There's lots of violence & gore on show, from slit throats to broken arms to ripped-out throats to exploding Werewolves to slashed wrists & chopped off heads. If your looking for blood then Underworld: Awakening delivers.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $70,000,000 this was filmed in British Columbia in Canada, the production values are great & the film is visually impressive even if it does feel empty in terms of it's story. The acting is alright, British names such as Stephen Rea & Charles Dance provide decent support although it's the sexy Beckinsale in tight black rubber that steals the show.<br/><br/>Underworld: Awakening carries on the visual look of the series & sees the return of Selene but it feels empty with the minimum of story to hold the action & gore together. I liked it enough & I would watch it again for the visuals, the action & the gore but it has no depth."

The story could be interesting, but the whole happening can be summarized in three sentences. The plot is reduced to some fights, there are no tricky/intellectual parts. The action parts are copies from the previous episodes, but much worse. The most ridiculous thing is that in the fight scenes the bad guys always get instantly killed, why the good guys are always just thrown away.<br/><br/>It looks like this movie was just an attempt to cash in the popularity of the series without further investment.<br/><br/>Don't bother with it."

","Kate Beckinsale delivers a perfect performance as the existentially depressed vampire and death dealing assassin protecting her coven or her lover, or this case, someone who turns out to be quite special. The franchise is fortunate to have landed a actress of her caliber, someone in real life who is probably more Shakespeare than an early laconic Eastwood as the bounty hunter with no name. Yet with her English accent and classy stage presence, she's more clever and resourceful than any recent James Bond and more deliciously ruthless than any tall blonde out to Kill Bill. Underworld Awakening is the very best movie I have ever seen in portraying the vampire's preternatural speed and super human abilities. This is achieved with a truly creative use of 3D and IMAX; the terrifically choreographed fight scenes manage to bring the audience to the edge of their seats wondering who will win -Selene or the really bad ass Werewolves. All this and a great cast supporting Beckinsale in a dark Gothic dream with Freudian overtones make this Underworld the best in the series."

I was hoping for at least a 9 star movie, but I was sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>The whole entire movie reminded me of how Resident Evil 3D was shot and I hated that look. Please,please, please film the next one for 2D and don't go for 3D just because it's the fad. The first 3 movies looked amazing. The props, the sets, the puppet work... even the CGI that was used was pretty good and doesn't look much worse on DVD. This movie had none of that feel.<br/><br/>The only characters I cared about at all in this movie were Selene and her daughter. The other characters were bland and hardly around for very long. The list of actors in the credits was only something like 15 people long. Don't even get me started on Michael. Movies 1 and 2 were about her and him. To me, you can't have an Underworld movie set after 1 and 2 that doesn't feature him prominently. I haven't heard why they couldn't/didn't get Scott Speedman, but if they don't get him for the next one I'm giving the next one -4 stars without even seeing it. What they did for the 30 seconds the character was in this movie was appalling. I would have rather had them not include him at all. I was actually cheering for the bad guys to kill him off, it bothered me that much.<br/><br/>I was also kind of expecting some sort of return of Lucien somehow. Raze didn't just drop the vampire blood near him and he didn't use it.. but sadly.. no appearance.<br/><br/>Super Lycan.. stupid. In my opinion the CGI used on that character was awful. The whole storyline around that part of the movie also was rather muddled, at least to me.<br/><br/>This whole movie felt like it was just a filler story between movie 2 and a possible movie 5. A bunch of the action was just repeated stuff from the previous movies. More Lycans on walls, shooting floors/ceilings to make them weaker to get through them, etc. It all looks cool, but it's starting to get boring.<br/><br/>It also felt really short. The other movies have always so engrossed me that I felt like I'd been watching them for a long time, which I enjoy. This was so frenetic that just shot by, and not in a good way.<br/><br/>I'm begging the people that make the next one... make it better than this pile o' disappointment.

","Absolutely horrible movie. I've never been a big die-hard fan of the Underworld movies. But I have seen them all and they do indeed have an interesting story to tell. The dialog, sounds, effects, story and action have been topnotch in the first three movies. All of this is below average in this chapter.<br/><br/>It felt like it was oneliners all the way through. Maybe 5-10min of the dialog was actually interesting and had something to do with the bigger picture. The sounds were cheap. Mostly reminded me of teen horror/splatter design. A bullet through the arm sounded like the whole body exploded. And when we're at it... The gore was way over the top. Yeah yeah it looked ""good"" when a bodypart was riped off but who want to see the chainsaw-effect for each bullet? The action? There's some fast ninja vampires and big brutal lycans... And the fight between them are alright. But what really got on my nerve was the ooold mistake: ""Oh look! The hero is out of ammo! Everybody drop your weapons and charge the super fast hero with the big knife!"". Completely pulls you out of ""the moment"". The only thing connecting this movie with the rest is two characters we know and the fact that vampires and lycans doesn't like each other. That's basically what the movie is about. The movie description tells us that: ""The vampire warrioress Selene leads the battle against humankind"". I didn't see a battle against humankind. The only humans who died was the ones who was in the way between the vampires and lycans (And I'm not even sure they were human). Most of this review about the action. That's because 95% of the movie is action. It's a disgrace against the series.<br/><br/>The only reason I'll give it 3/10 is because Beckinsale and Eisley does an amazing job at what can actually be called ""story telling""."
"kpole65","5","32","64","20 January 2012"," This story play line leads away from the original concept
","I was very disappointed with this movie. Too much action and seems throw together very quickly even though it took 3 years before it came out. I was looking for this movie to go together with the other sequels and it did not. Writers need to stick to the story line more than drift this far from it. It seems that they were more concerned with the 3-D graphics than anything else and no information was given why somethings were happening to the main character when they were no possible with the second sequel. I was hoping that they would have went back to explain why Marcus changed Victor or even when the Corvinus family got changed."
"Scarecrow-88","3","4","5","10 May 2012"," Underworld: Awakening
","Underworld Awakening opens as Humans are hunting down vampires (they are considered ""the infected"") in what is considered ""the great purge"", also eradicating lycans it seems. It is announced that lycans have been rendered extinct and few vampire covens remain in hiding. Selene and Michael are hoping to board a ship and leave but human SWAT police keep them from doing so. Selene awakens after a bomb knocks her and Michael unconscious, inside a cryogenic chamber, someone has freed her, and she soon discovers that it is her daughter, Eve (India Eisely). Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) is lead scientist in a corporation called Antigen, the leaders in trying to find a cure (or this is what they tell the public at large) and help to ""cleanse the Earth"" of infection. Ultimately, of course, Lane has sinister plans involving a lycans uprising and the downfall of the entire vampire race In little over 78 minutes, Underworld:Awakening is an uninspired action film loaded from start to finish with CGI violence and gore. No heart or soul to speak of and the Selene character, despite the storyline establishing her as a mother trying to protect her daughter, hasn't evolved all that much since the last two movies featuring her. Michael is only in the first minutes (I don't know why this character was practically written out of the series unless the actor had previous commitments), and mentioned here and there in the dialogue, but Awakening is essentially Selene in a war with Rea (who has a son played by Holden-Ried) who has kidnapped ""subject two"", daughter Eve for testing which could help discover a cure that stops silver from killing lycans. This is terribly important to Rea for reasons I will not reveal. Basically you get the same kind of attack scenes seen in previous films between werewolves and vampires, Selene right in the middle. The whole movie just goes through the motions, no depth or care given to breathe life into a tired series. I hope Beckinsale decides to hang up the tight leather suit as her character is as tired as the franchise by this point. I think the first two films were fun and had their moments, but there's nothing here I think that cries out as particularly memorable. Even the usual chase scene where lycans pursue Eve, in the back of a van driven by Selene lacks conviction. Selene finds allies in a young vampire male (basically a GQ model) and a human cop (whose wife was turned by a vampire and later killed during the purge), so there's help for her, but this, for the most part, is all about her taking out every foe that crosses her. The CGI werewolves look exactly like cartoons and the vampires (including Charles Dance) lack any real personality. You can easily skip this fourth film and not miss anything."
"hapunagirlpt","8","22","43","21 January 2012"," Kate Kicks Uber Lycan A**
","Kate Beckinsale is hot as ever in this 4th installment of the Underworld franchise. This movie moves super fast and is full of gore and action from start to finish. I love my vampire/werewolf movies and this one doesn't disappoint. Though lacking a little bit in storyline, it makes up for it with swift action and great special effects. In the words of my 9 year old son, ""This movie is awesome!"" My main reason for watching movies is to keep me entertained, and this movie did that without fail. It was great to see India Eisley on the big screen, I won't spoil it for those of you who don't know what her role is in this film, but let's just say that I think she did a great job. Though Scott Speedman (Michael) is missing in this film, Theo James (David) is super HOT in this installment. So all in all, this is probably my favorite of all the Underworld movies."
"oscarxp25","1","10","17","28 February 2012"," Why did Kate come back for this?
","There is an old saying that ""money is the root of all evil"". This statement is usually reserved for people involved with bribery, corruption, banking, and politics. Well, I am taking that statement and applying it to everyone involved in the making of this film. This movie was made to suck money from our pockets by people who don't care about a once worthy movie property. They destroy it.<br/><br/>The original ""Underworld"" was a fresh take on the centuries old rivalry between vampires and werewolves (called ""lycans"" here). It wasn't game changing cinema, but a movie with interesting characters, worthy performances, and slick action sequences. This movie, clocking in at a incredibly short 73 minutes, not only destroys, but turns its back on what once was a promising series. The second film was as good as the first. I did not see the third, but heard it was good. When people rip on ""Twilight"" for the terrible acting, the teenage girls now have a film to use as evidence to show it ain't that bad in Stephanie Meyer's universe. Everyone in this film is terrible; even Kate Beckinsale. Beckinsale, who was so good in the first two, is sleep walks though this film. I must give her some credit, at least she is better than the films terrible villains. The characters are lame, as are the actors playing them. They come off as laughable, not frightening or horrifying in anyway. The once cool designs of the Lycans have been replaced by rubber looking coyotes. Worst of all, there is not a single memorable action scene in the movie. It is just extremely boring to watch, considering all the gunfire going on.<br/><br/>Former director, now writer, Len Wiseman, tries to inject some emotion into the movie by creating a relationship between Beckinsale's character and a hybrid child created from her DNA. There is only so much you can do in the movie's short time span and given the amount the screen time these two have together, it doesn't work. It doesn't feel natural, only a cheap ploy to create some type of humanity in this action snooze fest.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen, who played a Lycon in the first three movies, wisely bowed out of this one. Beckinsale, I have no idea why she came back after walking away from the third one. My only guess is she got a pretty good amount of cash to reprise her role. The film does establish something; it is like its main character: empty, soul less and dead on arrival."
"omarh92","4","28","58","19 January 2012"," Not a well played story, more focused on action and effects
","Underworld went from a potential good series to now on the verge of being bad. The first movie started well, second continued in an alright pace, third should not be mentioned while the forth movie took a slight fall. The fall occurred due to the same mistake Hollywood keeps repeating intentionally, poor story, too much effects, way too much action and the worst of all, 3D. The story, which is attempting to continue the pace left at Underworld 2 is rather not bad and can result very well if played right, unfortunately due to the main focus on action and effects, the story was not focused on too well which could have made a difference in the entire movie. True the action and effects were pleasing, but even pleasing effects should have limits and must not cross the line only to be over done, in this case like many movies, the action and effects were over done, to a major extent. All and all, Underworld Awakening delivered the action which is in demand for the audience today, but the tradition of of good story telling must always be a movies back-bone."
"nofb","4","5","7","19 April 2012"," Not much to do with previous Underworld movies
","Much has already been said on the poor storyline in this instalment of the Underworld series, but apparently nobody is bothered by the major flaw in the story.<br/><br/>Why would Selene and Michael still be any other than mere humans, since they killed their ancestors, Marcus and William? It is clearly mentioned by Tanis, the historian, in Evolution, that killing a vampire or a lycan kills their whole bloodline. That's why at the end of Evolution Selene isn't burnt by sunlight anymore, and this poor explanation of a ""gift by Corvinus"" is ridiculous and an insult to the audience.<br/><br/>Sad, because they managed to insert the prequel (Rise of the Lycans) correctly in the initial story. Maybe the writers didn't care anymore this time."
"beta6-1","4","9","15","30 January 2012"," Just below average
","The movie offers decent action and cgi effect. Apart from that there is next to no character development and the story is so thinly spread that it feels like it only exists to connect fight sequences. <br/><br/>Where the first 3 Movies created some kind of atmosphere and offered some insight in the ""Underworld"" this one fails epically in those subjects<br/><br/>In addition to that the main actress only has one look to offer...emotionlessnes.<br/><br/>If you look for a cheap flick on rainy days it will probably suffice but not for anything else.<br/><br/>Its just disturbing how many studio reviewers try to over-hype the movie"
"james1080-272-547223","9","6","9","3 May 2015"," Utterly Superb!
","Kate Beckinsale is back in the tight leather as Selene, one of the darkest and coolest female action heroes with the full action package: she has slick fighting and shooting skills, a total bad-ass edge and that sexy British accent! For fans of the series this 4th instalment is a great comeback, it's short, sharp and solid, and it features the best performances seen in the whole franchise. Better yet is the excellent 3D, some may turn away from the conversion as they may think the darkness will dampen the effect but it's brilliant, throwing weapons and guns soar out the screen and the sense of depth is hugely effective, and looks best when inside the Antigen laboratories. I am jaw dropped even after many repeat viewings, definitely a must watch in 3D. The story is stronger than all the previous Underworld films, and there's a great theme of family amongst the blazing action and gore. Kate Beckinsale, Theo James, Stephen Rea, India Eisley, Sandrine Holt, Charles Dance and Kris Holden-Reid are an amazing cast with style, this is how Underworld should be: dark, stylish yet violent and explosive, this is the best in the franchise."
"mfd591","4","7","11","1 April 2012"," Over rated ... seriously
","Having watched the previous underworld films and enjoying them I expected big things from this installment. Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed and not impressed. Despite the stunning beauty of Kate B, nothing could save this film. The actions scenes were done well but there was no character or plot development. As a result I didn't care who killed who. Neither did I care about this 'Eve' character, was she an IVF baby? I felt like I was watching a Michael Bay movie (no character development, all action). I actually fell asleep for 5 min during the end and had to re watch the ending AND I LOVE VAMPIRE MOVIES. The only reason I would recommend anyone watching this movie is to admire Kate Beckinsale. Finally, overuse of CGI really annoys me so maybe it lost points in that respect."
"n-dc","3","7","11","16 February 2012"," Poorly done
","It was a real stretch to put as the summary ""leading the lycans and vampires in a war against humans"", since the main fighting through the movie was between vampire and lycans, with a human thrown in there. The movie really should have been set more as an intro to a new series rather than a continuation of the old one.<br/><br/>Storyline and plot just didn't seem to have any depth. Selene gets put to sleep, wakes up twelve years later, finds out she has a kid, and then fights. There was just nothing to it. I wasn't wondering how everything was connected, nothing really surprised me, the ""twists"" thrown in there were too predictable for any true suspense.<br/><br/>Character development fell short. Selene was the only character who was really developed in the movie and that includes development from Underworld 1 and 2. The rest of the characters that show up are put in there for extra combat twists, the slight stubborn opposition, and an overpowered enemy. Even Eve is barely developed. This is low in comparison to the previous Underworld movies, where you actually feel that you're getting to know the characters.<br/><br/>On the small plus side, we have lots of combat. We have Selene leaping through combat with werewolves, putting at least twenty bullets into each of their heads; we have a nearly twelve year old girl, tearing into faces; and we have lots and lots and lots of blood. The move is worth watching for the combat scenes, provided you like that type of combat.<br/><br/>Action and guns: Great Blood and gore: Great Anything else: Not worth it<br/><br/>Worth watching once, but a sore disappointment for me as an Underworld fan."
"tosodoula-d","5","7","11","29 January 2012"," Completely Overrated
","The movie was in itself not bad. It had some amazing scenes, it was more action-packed than any other 'Underworld' installment, Kate Beckinsale was a stunning presence and the special effects were absolutely gorgeous. The film lacked substance though.<br/><br/>The first movie introduced to us to the Underworld universe, where Vampires and Lycans had a history, an inheritance. In this third chapter (fourth, including 'The Rise of the Lycans') we get nothing like that. The plot is quite predictable and uninteresting, the new characters introduced seem like plot devices rather than three dimensional people and the little girl playing Selene's daughter looks nothing like Michael did when he changed...quite frankly to me it looked like a caricature of the girl in 'The Exorcist'. Also, for me it was a complete disappointment that not only none of the actors from the previous films returned, but, except for Michael, it seemed like their characters were completely forgotten.<br/><br/>I had fun watching it, mostly because I'll never say no to some good fight scenes and impressive building-to-building jumping, but while I had felt excited after leaving the cinema with the previous movies, with this one I just felt sort of blank, as if the movie had nothing truly memorable for me to hold onto."
"EmmaDinkins","8","17","33","23 January 2012"," Chix Chat on Film review: Selene gets back to basics.
","This installment of the Underworld series was the only sequel to premiere this weekend. I have grown to expect a great deal from sequels because my thinking is that if it gets green lit it should also get better funding. Better funding typically translates into better imagery. Underworld: Awakening was one of the best of the four Underworld stories and Rise of the Lycans was the worst, possibly because it was the only one sans Selene (Kate Beckinsale). The trailer tells us that now the Vampire and Lycan threat is that of the humans, based on their discovery of the existence of the underworld beings, but fortunately for the story line the plot thickened. Otherwise this would have been the second movie this weekend for which the trailer unveiled too much. This story was infused with some new blood, Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy) is added, I appreciated being given insight into his alliances and why. Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) is a new player in the battle whose motivations are not known until late in the story. David (Theo James) is also a new character who I immediately thought would add to Selene's evolution from Death Dealer to Day Walker to Cougar, not saying that's what happened but it crossed my mind. The final newcomer was a very clever addition although I find it so corny that whenever a female character is introduced in a story, who is somehow extraordinary that she has the name Eve (India Eisley), we get it already, there's no law against being creative with a name. I wasn't overly impressed with the look of the Lycans they had the projected look seen in old sci-fi B movies, but the over-sized giant Lycan seen in the trailer was a decent special effect. The best special effects were Selene in action doing what she does best, dropping from tall buildings in her signature stance, dealing out death with a graceful ease to the Lycans as well as to the new human enemy all while consistently wearing that signature pout and taking on the world in her plastic cat suit, although the look in the cat suit is all her no effects needed. The story stayed true to the series, it made sense and was none stop action from the beginning until the end. I like the creativity of these types of tales and with all the pretty supernatural and natural folks to focus on it was a viewer's win-win. I give it a green light."
"hidareitsme","1","13","24","5 February 2012"," Same Old Predictable Story Line
","I can't believe how many times this same story will be told. It's like watching a cowboy beat a dead horse over and over again. At least change the stick that the cowboy is using, some creativity would be much welcomed in these movies that are coming out.<br/><br/>I'm starting to believe that their is only one or two people really writing and directing these movies. The creators that are so called creating these movies must have a set play book that they all use without variance. Boring, and too predictable.<br/><br/>My advice is not to waste your money on this dead horse movie, or the next ten sorry sequels to follow. Wait for something with some original and creative thinking involved with the movie.<br/><br/>Movies like these are just brain dead and sad."

","This is the best movie in the Underworld series. Kate Beckinsale is back and better than ever. This time around, the existence of the vampire and lycan clans have been discovered by the humans and are targeted for annihilation. I saw it in the movie theatre in 3-D three nights ago and it was just out of this world. So far this is the only underworld film I saw in the theatre. There is so much action, lots of blood and gore. The transformations of the lycans are very beautifully done and well shot and the action scenes are very top notch. It also has very good storytelling. It is also very well crafted, very well directed and very well paced. In fact, the whole Underworld series is very well crafted, directed and well paced. What makes this film series different from other monster movies is that it has vampires and werewolves at war with each other. If you liked the Underworld series, I would recommend this movie. Underworld: Awakening is a very fun monster movie."
"robertemerald","9","2","2","30 December 2018"," Terrific action throughout
","It's true that this instalment doesn't have the charismatic villeins we know from the previous three, nor the Bram Stoker evil winged monster of Evolution, or the medieval mysticism of Rise of the Lycans. I think that it was this departure, with a storyline more in common with the original, that has caused some fans to think twice about Awakening. I myself thought some of the mystique had worn off with this one when I first saw it some time ago. But having watched it again I'm now convinced that this one deserves to rate well compared to the others. The editing, the use of silhouettes, and the more advanced use of stunts (Selene is extremely acrobatic, and that's for the entirety!), with wizard car chases, wizard jumps, lycans spinning cars, terrific explosions, brilliantly choreographed fight scenes, well ... it just works a treat. This is pure entertainment from start to finish. I strongly urge people to give this wonderful piece a fresh perspective."

","After taking an episode off Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is back. The Vampires and Lycans are in a new world in which their kind are being hunted and killed by humans in large numbers; they are being ""purged"". Even with a purge and the existence of Vampires and Lycans being public knowledge it hasn't stopped the feud between the species.<br/><br/>Awakening is a refreshing Underworld in that it brings us back to present day and brings back the super-""death dealer"", Selene. Her skills are on full display throughout with an array of weapons. She faces some incredible odds and expertly defies them time and again.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the modernity of the movie and adding the wrinkle of discovery and subsequent ""purging"". This episode brought us into the present day with media, police and corporations. It was no longer a confined fight between Vampires and Lycans existing in a vacuum. Awakening was action-packed with a cool story."
"Rainey-Dawn","7","2","2","15 October 2014"," Somewhat Disappointing
","Out of the 4 Underworld films, Awakening is the worst. Awakening is a good film but there are a couple of things that makes this one my least favorite and somewhat disappointing to me: One thing is Michael is not in the film and the first two films built Michael up to be a very important hybrid. Another disappointing thing is that the story lacks quite a bit -- it's just not as interesting as the other films (even with an added element: a daughter by Selene and Micheal). I also disliked the ""super lycan"" - that was just a bad (bunk) idea to me. Don't get me wrong Awakening is worth watching but it's just not as good as the first three films. Maybe I was just expecting something else from this 4th installment and that is why I was somewhat (but not completely) disappointed with this film.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

Usually such sequel are unnecessary. The stories are just pushed into the series and finally we feel that, hey that was not necessary. It spoiled the thrill of the first film. But not in this case.<br/><br/>Vampires in the underworld are hundred times more thrilling than the vampires in twilight saga. Kata Beckinsale returns as the beautiful, slick and stylish vampire gal Selene. But yes she has changed a lot. She looks older, yet she is still the same girl in action. New characters and addictions are nice of course. There is sequel yet to come to complete the sequel of this film, I hope it comes soon. <br/><br/>I rather not mention the plot much here. It is any day better to watch the film with absolutely no idea about the theme or the plot. <br/><br/>The visual effects are spectacular. One of the best 3D effects in a film. The dark scenes can be a little distraction for such effects. People who does not enjoy movies taken in the dark need not enjoy this.

It tells you everything you wanted to know. I am now very curious to see if the franchise will go further. And now if you watch all the film makes perfect sense. Know I am now a big fan of the Underworld franchise I do not want it to go much further. I think it has carried on for too long. I think they need to make a final movie and be done with it. So yes this movie is good. If they decide to make a few more movies then I will be fine with it but I just think if they do it will completely ruin the series and I will only watch it if it the same director returns. Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein did a brilliant job directing this. They realised that the franchise had a lot of flaws so they decided to fix them.

Underworld Awakening, and the whole Underworld series is unlike other vampire movies. So much action and vampire violence. It's all really intense. The Gothic lighting throughout the whole movie really helps set the mood, and the actors portraying the characters are very believable.<br/><br/>I will happily go see this movie twice!

"rostsit","10","10","19","23 February 2012"," Great action
","I admit there was more about action (and action was very good) than about plot, but I still give the movie 10/10. There was some important moments that make this movie unique for me. As I said, the plot doesn't have much to offer, BUT. ""My heart is not cold, it's broken"" - this line alone made it 10. The movie accents the priority of love. Do you think it's banal? Yes, but not when the parents' love and love between man and woman compared. When I learned the movie will have this daughter of main heroine, I was disappointed. Another sob story? Cry me a river. But the mother-daughter relationships shown were actually good and original - no hugging, no crying, no I love you, sweety!"" Selene behaves as she should - she lost her loved one, so she won't be smiling happy mom just because she now has a daughter (though of course she would protect her). Another moment that touched me is when Selene found Michael and wasn't responding long enough when that policeman called her and asked for help saving her daughter. Selene didn't betray her love just because of her parental duty! I think these moments were very deep and are actually rare nowadays in the movies and I'm not sure people who are prioritizing their children over everything else or people who forgot long ago what true love is will understand them (and there are about 90% of such people in the world). All in all, good action, great Selene, some deep moments and the ground for the fifth part. Good job."
"estebangonzalez10","5","6","10","19 May 2012"," A lot of action, no story
","¨For 12 years, I was held captive by the humans. The world I once knew has changed. Vampires and Lycans are now the hunted.¨ This is the fourth film in the Underworld franchise and this time Kate Beckinsale is back in the lead role after Rhona Mitra starred in the third one alongside Michael Sheen (which served as a prequel to the original film). If you've seen the other films then you probably know what to expect here because it is kind of the same thing: a lot of action and very little dialogue with voice over narration from Selene who lets us know everything that is happening. The first film of the franchise felt fresh and original, but these sequels have to stop because they seem to be repeating themselves with each movie. This time Awakening was directed by the Swedish duo Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein who have directed other Swedish films together in the past. There were about four screenwriters involved with the script and I really don't see why because there is hardly no story in this film, it focuses almost entirely on the action and there is really very little character development. Fans who are expecting to see a lot of action and eye candy will be satisfied with Kate's performance, but if you were looking for some more depth and more interesting characters then you will be disappointed with this fourth installment. The action is almost nonstop and the film is under 90 minutes long so time does go by pretty fast. If you are satisfied with good visuals then you might enjoy this film, but don't go into it expecting much more.<br/><br/>This fourth installment follows the similar premise where you have the lycans facing off against the vampires, except only this time both sides are being hunted by humans who are trying to exterminate them. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) narrates what is happening while she plans to meet up with Michael and escape with him, but they are ambushed by humans and a grenade goes off. Everything blacks out and we see Selene frozen inside a lab when someone seems to be freeing her. Selene wakes up and realizes she is in the Antigen laboratory run by Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) and manages to escape from all the security. Once free she tries to figure out what happened before the explosion went off and realizes that 12 years have gone by while she was kept frozen in the lab. She begins to look for Micheal, believing he was the one that freed her since she seems to be seeing his visions. While she is on the run some humans are after her, and so are some lycans. She runs into another vampire named David (Theo James) who helps her search for Micheal. Soon they realize that those visions Selene is having aren't from Micheal, but from someone else who is connected to her.<br/><br/>The entire movie moves at a really fast pace focusing mostly on the action and visual effects. Kate Beckinsale knows her part by memory and can do those tricks with her eyes closed. She is quite impressive on screen and really kicks some lycan butt. The rest of the cast really don't add anything new to the movie since there is barely any character development. What we have instead are 88 minutes of nonstop action. Other supporting actors in this film are Michael Ealy, India Eisley, Charles Dance, and Kris Holden-Ried. None of them really shine on screen, but they don't have to because Underworld Awakening is all about the action and seeing Beckinsale kill off as many lycans as possible. She does her job and if the viewer is satisfied with that then they will have a great time with this film, if not I would recommend you skip this movie because it has no other value than the well choreographed fighting scenes.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"

","As it says in the summary, this movie sucked, i really loved the earlier movies due to all the great action and story but when i saw this one it was as if they'd ran out of ideas, first of all this movie is 1h15min long, the hell is that all about? :S Second of all, it barely contained any action whatsoever, watching this movie was so pointless since i got as much information from it as from the trailer. The only positive part is Kate and her sexy outfit but besides from that I'm really disappointed. Her daughter first starts by ripping apart a werewolf but after that all she does is jump on peoples backs and hang on, what happened to the strength? And Corbin isn't even in this movie, I'm sorry but they really messed up this time."

","My left eye almost popped out of its socket when I saw this film got seven stars out of ten on IMDb. Then my right eye almost popped out when I read how much money they spent on making this movie. You can certainly tell they spent a lot of money... But you can't polish a turd with dollar bills. The main problems are the poor script and the lame, tired visual ideas. It makes you wonder if the good actors in this film actually read the script before accepting the part. Either the didn't, which is a bit strange... Or they did - and that is mind boggling. Why agree to star in a film with such an obviously inept script? Oh and some of the ideas/visuals... ""We have a lethal vampire loose in our secret lab! At once turn on the confusing, strobing lights that trigger epilepsy! What? Why we should do this!? I don't know - I've seen in movies they have those in their secret superlabs so I thought we should install our own... Kinda cool, huh?"" Amazingly, the film-makers seem unable to shake their obsession with strobing, flickering lights - they appear for no apparent reason in several scenes. The werewolves look stupid a cliché - like a really poor horror slasher film. Which this is, sort of. The facepalm moments... Like when vampire girl wakes up in secret lab (the one with the STROBING LIGHTS remember) and finds her latex suit and all her gear in a nice cupboard with a glass door right next to the bed... Wait... Its almost like the writer couldn't come up with something better... Or the script is written by a nine year old... One would have though it safer to keep the evil super vampire's belongings locked up in a safe place far away from where she might wake up any moment... A true facepalm moment. Of which there are many in this snore-fest of a film. I struggle to actually remember the story. Several times I felt a horrible urge to fast forward or walk out. The only things I clearly remember about this film are the cringeworthy story solutions and how forgettable it is. For the latter I should perhaps grateful."

The fight scenes are choppy and unwatchable (I'm forever ruined by the amazing fight scenes from ""The Matrix""). The plot is boring and unwatchable. The characters are empty and unwatchable. Do you see a trend here?<br/><br/>I would say ""Awakening"" has put a wooden stake in the heart of an otherwise fine franchise.

","The Fourth instalment of the Underworld series seems to have gone off track a bit. The first three had great special effects, great make-up, nice atmosphere and some amazing characters. this one has stepped away from the original style, its no longer dark and realistic, but has taken a turn towards the resident evil style. The special effects are over the top, even the blood is cheap cgi, spraying everywhere. the werewolves look different and i think almost all scenes with the lycans were cgi, none of the great make- up we had before and the over the top camera angles were just annoying at times. I was also disappointed to see the cheap cgi of the werewolf transformation. the original one was really good. As a action film, it was pretty decent, but as a sequel to the original underworld and a fan of the first three, this ones falls a bit flat. its a shame none of the original cast couldn't reprise there characters to give it a more underworld feel to it. As an action film, i would give this a 6/10, but as an underworld film, i give it a 4. right down the middle - overall a 5/10"

","After the first three movies of Underworld I really thought I'd enjoy this film. But surprise, surprise as the reviews said it definitely wasn't as good as the first three... I just felt with the other movies in the franchise they had done really well with the balancing of the plot line and characters-the characters seemed really well developed which is hard to do in an action-packed film. In this one- however- I felt they rushed in too quickly with the story not developing the characters to having a purpose in the film. It felt like they were just there to fill a role rather than add anything valuable to the movie! I especially didn't like the way they got rid of Scott Speedman look-a- like(as Michael Corvin) at the beginning as I felt there was no need and Kate's character got over this pretty damn quickly! Then the Michael Corvin character magically reappears again at the end just as we've got used not seeing him around anymore! In comparison to the Underworld and Underworld Evolution movies(which I thought were at least worth 8/10) this felt like a complete let down... However, I would say it was worth a watch as when you got to the final fight scene it does get quite exciting! There is -however-one last thing I do not understand about the whole film: the short synopsis simply says ""When human forces discover the existence of the Vampire and Lycan clans, a war to eradicate both species commences."" which is silly as we find out later in the film that the employees at Antigen are in actual fact all Lycans apart for the unfortunate woman scientist who gets killed by them. This fact just shows that the storyline was not thought out and this film claims to be something it's not. The only reason my rating of this film reached a 4 is because Kate Beckinsale is still as intriguing and beautiful as ever! But there are major holes in this story so if your in for a good story this is not the film for you..."

"Suncerae","10","12","26","22 January 2012"," Great Movie> Period!
","I am reading these reviews and some of you are actually not true Underworld fans. If all the Elders are gone, where do you expect the story line to go. We know the history of both the Vampires and the Lycans, so they came up with a new storyline. Not that hard to see that. And the action made it a movie worth seeing. And as for the comparison to Resident Evil, I am a fan of that too and to be honest, these are nothing alike, and even with all the action of Resident Evil, it still lack substance in the last film. This gave you something to look forward to in the near future. And yes it was mainly about Selene. Duh, she just woke up and now is adjusting to modern day versus what she last recall. And it does follow the storyline if you paid close attention. -Why does Viktor kill his daughter Sonya? After learning that his daughter falls in love and becomes pregnant with a Lycan's child, he orders her to be killed. Sonya falls in love with Lucian. Viktor has her burned alive by the sun when he finds out about his daughter's pregnancy and her love for a Lycan. Now Seline has the child that should have been originally born then. Just upgraded but within the same bloodline...lol. -Why was Selene fighting to start? To revenge her family,now she is saving what's left of a family she just realizing she has. As for Selene and Micheal's Daughter, Eve...she is a beast...lol. But the best part is this movie is about the connection she is trying to understand and grow with her mother.The next installment leaves the idea that she will be doing the same with her father since her last ""vision"" was from his eyes, now that Selene has freed him. <br/><br/>So again, if u like Underworld movies, go see it. It's action packed. fun and definitely a good start to 2012. As a matter of fact, im going to see it again."
"fxbgrd","1","10","21","29 January 2012"," A nausea-inducing experience
","It pains me to give any Underworld film such a low rating (especially that I gave the last one, Rise of the Lycans (2009), a 10 out of 10) but I couldn't help feeling entirely disappointed last night as I walked out of the cinema.<br/><br/>Before I go into why I thought the film was such a waste of my money and time, allow me to highlight some positive aspects of the film. Kate Beckingsale's performance as Selene was superb. And beautifully choreographed fight scenes were truly spectacular. Also, it must be said that there were some good ideas in the storyline - it's just a shame that they were not adequately developed. That said, I have little else to add by way of praising it, despite my best efforts to be a generous critic of the film, given that I am a loyal fan of the Underworld films.<br/><br/>First of all, the 3D format. There were moments in the cinema theatre where I genuinely thought I'd be sick and would have to leave the theatre mid way through watching the film. But I was so determined to convince myself that this film would be superb, so I persevered. As I went on desperately trying to enjoy the film, I found myself thinking: 'Oh, and now it looks as if Selene's pistol is exiting the screen'; 'Here they've tried to make it look as if the Lycan is jumping out of the screen to attack me, but not entirely convincingly'; 'Oh look! A shard of exploding glass flying out of the screen right at me!' All of this 3D stuff did little to ""add"" to my cinema experience; in fact, it ""detracted"" much from it. My audio visual senses were so overwhelmed that I struggled not to be sick and to try hard to focus on what's going on in the film. Additionally, the 3D seemed to actually be quite distracting when one's trying to figure out what's going on in the fight scenes, but just keeps getting distracted by debris flying out of the screen and losing focus. So now the mind has to work double hard to get a grip and regain visual focus - 'Where was I, again?' I kept trying hard to pull myself back into the film. So much for ""adding to my film-watching experience""! It in fact left me mentally drained, nauseous, confused, my senses overwhelmed, and - most importantly - it seemed a very poor excuse for a bad/bland story line, which brings me to my next point.<br/><br/>I don't want to add spoilers so I'll refrain from going into detail, but suffice to say that I can write the whole story of Underworld Awakening on the back of a cigarette packet without much loss to content. This is due to the fact that not much happens in the story, really - plenty of action, and mind-bending, nausea-inducing 3D, yes; but don't expect much else. The story line in Underworld Awakening - contrary to the sophisticated one in Rise of the Lycans - is truly yawn-inspiring. Every story has a beginning, middle and end. The story in this film finished somewhere around the middle by the time the credits rolled. Needless to say, it was such an anti-climax. <br/><br/>And now, onto the characters. Not only is Selene the only character from the other Underworld films and the rest all new (if done tastefully, this needn't be anything negative in and of itself) but the sidekick characters we so flat and two dimensional that it left me wondering why the film-makers hadn't spent half the time and energy writing rich, 3D characters than focusing on 3D visual effects. Not only were the characters - other than Selene's - so flat and rigid that they failed to draw you in, but some of the acting was truly awful. There were also times where their lines were so obviously bad that I had to feel bad for the actors playing these roles. At other times however, I kept wondering why an actor had a frozen expression with no emotions on display when the lines demanded the opposite - the actors and their lines didn't seem to be in sync for much of the film, making their performances poor and the script utterly amateurish. Again, the characters, lines and acting in Underworld Awakening stand in the very opposite (bad) end of the quality spectrum when compared with the well performed and well-written characters of Rise of the Lycan.<br/><br/>All I can say is that I lament the time and money I spent going to the cinema watching Underworld Awakening 3D. Not only has it put me off watching any 3D film, but it left me angry thinking how could a superb film such as Rise of the Lycans be followed by this!"

","Kate Beckinsale returns as the latex clad, vampire warrior, Selene, caught up in a war between Vampires, Lycans and Humans. Kate's Husband, Len Wiseman has stepped out of the director's chair for this latest addition to the Underworld series, handing the reins to Swedish duo Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein, making their theatrical debut.<br/><br/>First, lets get one thing out of the way, Underworld: Awakening has shamelessly ripped off Resident Evil: Afterlife. The similarities are numerous, from the way the film is shot to the story line. But then, why not? Resident Evil : Afterlife breathed life back into the Resident Evil series, and if there were ever a series that needed resuscitating then Underworld was it. How the series managed to ride the success of the first Underworld, through almost ten years and two lousy sequels is an impressive accomplishment of its own. It took four attempts, but they finally got it right.<br/><br/>Underworld: Awakening is fast and exciting from the opening scene to the credits, its packed with edge of your seat action that doesn't flag or become repetitive. Some of the Lycan CGI is questionable, but the rest of the film looks beautiful and sleek, using the series' signature dark greys, solid blacks and striking blue tones, blended with bold lines and sharp angles. The story moves extremely quickly but is easy to follow, and barring a few minor plot holes, makes sense. There are a few things that will make your jump and cringe, but this is more of an action horror so don't expect to lose any sleep. After seeing this, your more likely to go out and buy a cool leather jacket than go to bed with the lights on. At 88 minutes, it's relatively short, but it doesn't feel like it, the ending wraps up perfectly, leaving you wanting more. Underworld: Awaking is a lot fun."

","From the first moments of the film, the film blasts into nonstop action scenes that the audience won't have time to take a breath. One scene ends, probably a 90-second rest and our heroes fight again with the bad guys. And this time around, we have a new group between the wars: the humans. So the battle here is pretty much Vampires vs. Lycans vs. Humans (although the humans don't actually do any part in the war).<br/><br/>After evading the previous installment, Kate Beckinsale returns to reprise the role of the sadistic, sexy vampire Selene. She's back after experiencing a 12-year sleep in a human facility and being held captive for several reasons. But then, a mysterious hybrid (a combination of vampire and Lycan) awakens her and soon, Selene has to protect the hybrid from the impending threats committed by the Lycans and humans.<br/><br/>The bad guy here is a scientist who works for the facility in which Selene had been trapped. But deep down inside, he's actually a Lycan who aims to triumph over the vampires and humans. And he's got a sidekick, his son named Jacob who's a Lycan but through some process, possesses extra abilities (e.g. more gigantic rippling muscles, heal instantly after being injured).<br/><br/>The action scenes are fantastic and wildly entertaining. They're incredibly fast-paced and this movie definitely provides more than we need. From the first seconds of the film, the movie immediately starts accelerating into full tension with its extravagant and exuberant fighting scenes. The action never stops and there's barely any scenes involving words coming out of the actors' mouths.<br/><br/>The 3D here is mediocre. Some of the scenes offer eye-popping effects while at other scenes, the 3D was hardly noticeable. Some of the scenes didn't even look blurry when I took off my 3D spectacles. Unlike the similar ""Resident Evil: Afterlife"", ""Awakening"" offers less eye-popping effects and the 3D here acts like more of an optional choice than a mandatory one.<br/><br/>The acting was okay, not too shabby. But they just don't have enough lines. It's like they're reluctant to talk. There is just not enough things to say that I barely got to know with the characters. I was like ""What's his name? What's her name?"" The characters don't talk at all. They must have been in some sort of detention class.<br/><br/>But overall, ""Underworld: Awakening"" is a wildly entertaining film. I'm sure boys will enjoy this film and I'm sure most wouldn't be disappointed after leaving out the theater, as well as for ""Underworld"" fans. There are plenty of action scenes and it's just sheer fun watching this film. ""Awakening"" is a visual feast of blood, violence, and action.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: ""Underworld: Awakening"" is an impressive, stylish entry to the popular ""Underworld"" series that offers plenty of action, blood, and violence.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

She is useful for the jump factor and on at three occasions she jumped in her seat (not bad for a 77 minute film) and her final view was 'A bit gory'.<br/><br/>A bit gory is right but as it is CGI gore one soon becomes immune to it, It's only a film after all, the CGI is rather good though the 3-D was kept to a minimum and used mainly in explosions and gas effects, the occasional 'character in front of background' shots were rather bad, looking more like pop-ups than scenes, the boom-bang effect was quite satisfying and the weaponry was nothing that would make an old soldiers' eyebrows raise in disbelief, something that often spoils a film for me.<br/><br/>Kate carries her role off with her usual tight-lipped seriousness, her dialogue is kept to a comic book minimum and as the story is mainly a long search very few pointers are required to keep the story line rolling along from one fight to the next and just as a comic-book would end openly so does the 4th Underworld with a possible 3 or 4 lines for a sequel to follow.<br/><br/>Charles Dance is the English actor whose turn it is to be the 'baddie' and though he doesn't feature greatly other than to offer an alternative view of the future of vampires in the modern world one gets the feeling that there have been cuts made to his part of the storyline and a slight feeling of dissatisfaction is felt that his character wasn't exploited to the full. More a Greek chorus than a central character.<br/><br/>As I don't want to give anything away and dislike using the spoilers alert I can only finish with a thumbs-up. Where a lot of series would be losing momentum by the fourth edition, Underworld seems to have hung onto it's ability to keep an audience interested, apart from the huddle of cackling and possibly tipsy women in the front row everybody else seemed glued to the screen and there was no complaining among the crowd as we left the cinema.<br/><br/>Definitely a film to get the popcorn for."
"kannibalcorpsegrinder","9","7","14","28 September 2012"," A lot of fun but mildly flawed
","After the discovery of both species is discovered by humanity, vampire Selene is captured only to awaken years in the future where she must protect her daughter from the vicious Lycans intending to use her in their crusade to wipe out the vampires.<br/><br/>Overall this was an extremely fun and extremely enjoyable entry in the franchise that contains a lot to really love about it. One of the main things with this one is the fact that, as an action movie it hardly fails since we get numerous scenes of outstanding spectacle that are quite fun. From the opening dispatch of the police squad hunting them down in the apartment complex that's filled with great hand-to-hand fighting, gunfire and even impressive fireballs due to plenty of explosive action undertaken, mixed together with an exciting visual flair that serves the scene well, it's got a lot of action here at times. Other big action scenes are the escape from the laboratory where she rips apart the guards in fine fashion and leads into a terrific car- chase trying to get away while the werewolves try to get inside but are stopped in graphic fashion, the ambush on the vampire lair offers plenty of blazing gunfights and even lots of great gore as this gets exceptionally bloody, and there's an exceptional bullet-riddled shootout here to overtake the command center which features some fantastic stunt- work and gunfights so there's plenty of action-packed fun here. Another big factor here is perhaps the film's finest point in how it escalates the story of their war against each other. By including a new form of the werewolves with the hulking monstrosity featured as part of the story about regenerating their numbers and evolving to fight on, allows even more fun to be had in the parking lot finale where it gets a chance to showcase itself nicely. That, though, introduces the film's two main problems, in an over-abundance of lame and pedestrian CGI that really ruins the entire sequence as the whole thing appears to be shot in that manner and it's an extended, drawn-out battle so there's plenty of time to grow irritated at the practice. Of course, it's only so long because of the sudden change in the creature's personality, which is maddeningly inconsistent since it's more interested in throwing her around instead of just killing her swiftly like it's done to all the others it's encountered before. Still, it's not all that bad and really is quite watchable.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and children-in-jeopardy."
"flakfan","8","7","14","28 January 2012"," Kate Beckinsale is great
","If Kate had crawled through that ductwork nude with good lighting behind the camera, I would give it a 10. She is a great action star and beautiful to boot. Just as physical as Mila, Angelina, Uma, Linda H., Carrie Ann, Sigorney, Linda C., Halle, or a bevy of others; she is the hottest of the hot, like the Sun hot. The story never plays out old. Special effects are great. This is the kind of vampire movie people should pay money to see instead of the limp, wussy, pathetic Twilight garbage (although Ashley Greene is very very hot, like a slightly smaller sun). This is the kind of movie once on DVD, people buy it again and again with the whole series. Go see the movie, get some popcorn, a drink, sit back and enjoy the show and Kate doing her thing in a tight black jumpsuit with some great SCI-FI theatrics to boot."

","Sorry, I just don't buy it: I sincerely think the emperor lacks clothes, here.<br/><br/>Everyone talks about the back story and the mom/daughter bonding and the conflict and all that, but why do I get the impression that at heart all this was a dim premise to generate a bunch of CGI heat? I know I'm fully capable of resonating with a compelling myth; don't tell me I just ""don't get it"".<br/><br/>I really don't belong here: Movies like this are almost another species of public entertainment. I love love love lo-tech flicks that pry my heart open and remind me of what truth, beauty, and heroism really are.<br/><br/>This is a great movie if non-stop violent action with little-to-no motivational narrative support floats your boat. I mean that: I have enough imagination to realize that there is a significant demographic that digs this, and more power to them and the sector of the film system that caters to them. But if you like a great story and you like to be truly touched by something beautiful in a movie, don't be surprised if this flick leaves you cold.<br/><br/>Well, this film does leave us with one powerful existential question: Why, in the future, are public spaces lit solely by fluorescent bulbs that flicker on and off incessantly? Will epilepsy have been completely eradicated by then? Are the janitors frequently on strike?"

The ""monsters"" in this movie do not surprise anyone. They are terribly common and weak.. Poor portraits of what imagination could provide.

"chaz-28","3","17","44","20 January 2012"," A weak and forgettable addition to the Underworld franchise
","It is rare for a movie franchise to make it to a fourth film. The Star Wars and Harry Potter franchises had it easy, Star Wars technically started on its fourth installment and Harry Potter had its stories directly handed to them. The Die Hard series had to work for it but held its head above water while the Alien series fell off a cliff when Alien: Resurrection hit the screen. Underworld: Awakening is following in the footsteps of the Alien franchise.<br/><br/>There is brief ""remind me of the previous three films"" montage at the beginning for those of you who have forgotten the story throughout the years and then Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is back in her familiar gargoyle perch surveying the dark city around her. Unlike Underworld: Evolution, which picked up right where the original left off, Awakening jumps forward a bit to a time when human beings are now hunting both vampires and lycans. These purges are wiping out both species with ruthless effectiveness and extinction may be close at hand. Selene and her hybrid (both vampire and lycan) boyfriend Michael are both wrapped up in it and then comes the big flash forward.<br/><br/>Selene wakes up 12 years later from a block of ice after being thawed out in a maximum security laboratory. It seems she has been studied, poked, prodded, and subjected most likely to everything in between by its chief scientist Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) who says he is looking for a cure for both vampire and lycan afflictions. A pre-teen girl known as Subject 2 (India Eisley) is responsible for her release and becomes the catalyst for the chase sequences in this Underworld iteration between vampires, lycans, and humans.<br/><br/>Just as the story in Alien: Resurrection was only scarcely attached to its previous episodes, Underworld: Awakening is also much more detached than its predecessors. The vampires and lycans we are familiar with are gone, except for Selene, so now we watch her latch on to a new ad hoc crew including the vampire David (Theo James) and police Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy). Not everything has changed though, Selene conveniently finds her old black leather fetish outfit to the enjoyment of this film's majority male audience.<br/><br/>Awakening is also the first installment in 3D whose effects are needless and actually hurt the film. The Underworld atmosphere is already dark and rainy; the 3D makes it that much darker which exceeds the fine line of ""too dark"". Seeing it in IMAX; however, is worth the extra bucks because of the bass. Lycans must come with their own attached sub-woofers with a tremendous low end because every time one is on screen the bass goes into overdrive which is a small consolation to make up for the weak 3D.<br/><br/>The Underworld films were never particularly strong, but the first and third films (the prequel Underworld: Rise of the Lycans) were enjoyable. Awakening joins its cousin Underworld: Evolution in the reduced discount and throw away Underworld bin. The story is frail, the screenplay is sloppy, the characters are forgettable, and Underworld: Awakening should be avoided at all costs."
"moviexclusive","6","6","12","31 January 2012"," Sacrificing plot and character in favour of pure all-out action, this fourth entry promises thrilling action and the return of Kate Beckinsale in tight spandex
","Just as how Milla Jovovich has come to define the 'Resident Evil' film series, Kate Beckinsale's name has become synonymous with the 'Underworld' franchise- so much so that the third instalment 'Underworld: Rise of the Lycans' which she sat out in place of her doppelganger Rhona Mitra ended up with the worst box-office of the trilogy. And so her husband Len Wiseman has wisely (pardon the pun) placed her front and centre into this fourth entry, which eases up on the mythology of the earlier films in favour of a balls-out wall-to-wall action-packed thrill ride.<br/><br/>You could say that 'Underworld: Awakening' has gone somewhat the way of the 'Resident Evil' movies, where plot is kept to a minimum and the absence of which is substituted with loud, and we mean very loud, action of the sexy female in spandex type. Ah yes, did we forget to mention that Beckinsale still looks smashing as ever in her black leather outfit, the very opportunity to see her kick ass enough to draw out genre fanboys of all ages? Indeed, Beckinsale is an arresting presence playing the vampire warrioress Selene, even as the story proves less so.<br/><br/>Not to fret if you haven't seen the earlier movies, Swedish directors Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein do neophytes a favour with a tidy recap of the key events of the first two movies 'Underworld' and 'Underworld: Evolution' before unveiling the current state of affairs where vampire and werewolf alike are now hunted by the humans bent on exterminating both species. Lured into an ambush with her lover, the vampire-Lycan hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman), Selene is left cryogenically frozen for 12 years. Her release from the detention lab of Antigen, a biotech firm looking to engineer a vaccine against vampires and Lycans, was no accident- she is freed by another test subject.<br/><br/>Turns out the head scientist Dr Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea) has also been experimenting with her daughter Eve (India Eisley), the latter's sudden transformation in the midst of a high-speed chase from hapless child to feral vampire-werewolf hybrid not for the weak of heart. Selene and Eve find shelter with David (the fittingly buff Theo James) whose father Thomas (Charles Dance) is the head of a vampire coven living below ground. Lycans come, kill most of the clan, take Eve away, prompting Selene to go to her rescue, but not before finding an unlikely ally in the form of a sympathetic cop Sebastian (Michael Ealy). That about is as much narrative the quartet of writers (Len Wiseman, John Hlavin, J. Michael Straczynski, and Allison Burnett) brings to the brief 84-min movie, leaving the rest of the work to Marlind and Stein.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the pair, who is attempting their first big-screen Hollywood feature, proves more than worthy for the task. Making full-use of their mid-sized budget, they stage a couple of impressive action setpieces- beginning with Selene's breakout from the maximum-security Antigen lab, to a vicious attack by the Lycans on the underground vampire covenant, and culminating finally in a thrilling three-way fight that pits Selene against an alpha Lycan, Eve against Dr Lane, and David against a horde of Lycans- despite the fact that none of them particularly put the third dimension (a first for the franchise) to good use.<br/><br/>Marlind and Stein also deserve compliments for not overdosing on the slo-mo (here's looking at you, Paul W.S. Anderson) and framing each scene properly so you can take in the action in its full glory. For action fans, this is simply an orgasmic pleasure, with nary a dull moment throughout the entire movie- the tense and tight pacing admittedly one of the advantages of having the leanest runtime of the entries. <br/><br/>That said, it sacrifices character (Rea's one-dimensional villain is a poor substitute for Bill Nighy's deliciously evil vampire elder) and narrative depth (Wiseman's earlier attempts to build modern-day vampire folklore is all but missing here)- both of which may earn the ire of some franchise fans. Still, this is the most consistently action-packed entry of the franchise, and succeeds admirably on the level of an adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride. As per the norm for franchise entries, it leaves room for yet another chapter, though we hope that the next time we revisit the 'Underworld', there will be more reason to stay on than just Beckinsale and some furious non-stop action."

","OK the story left off last time with the original werewolf and original vampire being killed off. Lovely Kate became human if you remember correctly and the only way the current movie could happen again is if it was a time before the main werewolf and vampire were killed. Don't worry most movie makers are more interested in the big buck rather than follow the storyline anyway. By the way 3D sucks unless your in a IMAX theater I wish they would quit making 3D. I would wait for the DVD and use a coupon or discount code so you don't get ripped off! If you do see it in 3D and its not an IMAX theater you will have to sit right up front to get the effects. I really don't like vamp movies anyway so this is another painful experience for me."

Sometimes you just drive it in the ground, when you keep it going too long.<br/><br/>Vampires separated warrior Selene(Kate Beckinsale) is separated from Michael after an explosion, crogenical frozen, when she comes out of it, she finds that 12 years have passed.<br/><br/>I don't give anything away. This film is not bad, it just has too many plot holes, that never get explained, or either they do, but go pretty quickly. Some action scenes don't disappoint, and effects too are awesome, better than Red Riding Hood(2011). But it rips off a little Matrix Reloaded and Resident Evil, but this is a movie you can enjoy on a Friday night."
"guisreis","8","4","7","2 February 2016"," A fantastic beginning; afterwards, just nice action
","In my opinion, opposite to many reviews, this is probably the best film from the franchise. The ""Purge"" beginning is very nice. Indeed, if that environment had been kept until the film finished, it would be one of the best vampire movies ever. Kate Beckinsale shines (if it is possible to say that about a vampire!) once again in the charismatic leading role. I liked to see ""Tywin Lannister"" Charles Dance with vampire teeth too. India Eisley, the girl, also does a good job and has some creepy quasi-""The Exorcist"" moments. The first part of the movie is by far the best. Unfortunately, it looses most of its dramatic impact afterwards, becoming a conventional action thriller. Though, it is still an entertaining flick until the end. Selenes's final fight is great."

The stories made sense and I could quite easily put myself into the movies and be content.<br/><br/>Then I watched this. I hesitate to call it a movie as it honestly does little justice to the word and implication *movie*. I sat in shock through the first twenty minutes looking at my husband and asking him. *Is this a joke?* he just looked back and shook his head. But I decided to watch the whole movie to be sure.<br/><br/>Here you have a two distinct cultures of secretive beings. Yet we are to believe that human beings could so easily infiltrate their defenses, safe houses, hideouts etc? We are to believe that they are outsmarted by humans? Seriously?

The people that produced it should issues an apology to everyone. They should also issue a refund of the tickets. Perhaps other people hold to different standards but this was not worth the watch in any way at all.<br/><br/>To think they spent $70,000,000 ,making this ?? What a complete waste of money.

","O.k....I liked it. Not a part of the original trilogy, but a beginning of a new one with the same old problem...Lycans. I was wondering how long Kate can continue to go forward and try to look the same age as she was during the first film. Christopher Lee use to joke about how difficult it was to make him appear the same age as Dracula in the 1950-70s Hammer Dracula series. She still looks ready to go here, and in this film, she is thrown around a bit more than before. I though the film recaptured the Gothic look of the original trilogy and the plot was easy to follow (although in action/horror genre does it really matter ?). I watched this on DVD and I will say the only problem I found was the directors commentary...which was dull."

"nichomach","9","7","15","26 January 2012"," Excellent addition to the series
","Underworld: Awakening is a fast-paced action movie, with excellent performances from all the cast. Reminiscent of Underworld: Evolution in its unrelenting pace, it actually feels like a significantly more cohesive effort than that. I liked U:E, but at times it felt too much like a progression of set-pieces rather than a continuous narrative. Fortunately, the adroit pacing, strong plot and convincing performances here neatly avert any such misgivings with U:A. <br/><br/>Beckinsale is excellent again, taking the character of Selene forward and establishing a new battleground for our favourite death-dealer, Stephen Rea makes a convincingly sinister evil mastermind, Michael Ealy turns in a good solid performance, Kris Holden-Ried's Quint is appropriately savage while India Eisley's debut in the series promises great things should it continue and should she remain involved in it (which I hope she does). A nice cameo from Charles Dance (I've always suspected that he wasn't entirely human...) rounds things out nicely. Frankly, I'm only knocking a point off for it being too short, and if that's the worst I can say of a movie, then they're doing something right..."
"dreamflix","8","7","15","22 January 2012"," No Sleep Walking for Selene
","Good to see Beckingsale come back to this role. This film is well done. Though the year is never given as to when Selene wakes up, and because it was filmed in Eastern Europe, it's hard to tell if it's supposed to be present-day or not. But it really doesn't matter, considering Selene wakes up to find out that Lycans and Vampires were being extinguished by humans. There was some chatter about previous films with a battle between Beckinsale and Michael Sheen, who played Lucian, or who was going to direct this one. But the end result is that this is a good film, worth collecting.<br/><br/>Selene comes out of her chamber and the audience learns that she's been experimented on for the past twelve years. She is Specimen Two and she assumes Specimen One is her beloved Michael. Turns out there's a hybrid girl who broke out of her chamber and released Selene. The child is a product of Selene and Michael. So the lycans are after the girl, the vampires don't want her, nor Selene, and the police are hot on their trail.<br/><br/>So you can imagine the action. There is one time where Detective Sebastian (played by Michael Ealy of Barbershop and Seven Pounds - and yes, his eyes are really blue)asks Selene why is it that she can stay out in the sun? She answers that she ""had help with that"". Selene seems to be more powerful in this installment. She jumps a lot, she runs a lot and she shoots a lot. Her fight scenes are good, yet the new breed of lycans are quite animated as well. Then there's David (played by Theo James), a vampire who wants to side with Selene because she is a fighter. It seems that the lycans and the vampires have been run underground (separately), and still fighting one another. In comes Dr. Lane (played by Stephen Rhea of Priest), who is working with another doctor (played by Sandrine Holt, who has a history of action films, such as Resident Evil: Apocalypse, Starship Troopers, and TV series such as Once a Thief, Witchblade and Mutant X) who are trying to engineer a bigger, faster lycan.<br/><br/>Becksinsale actually gets a good workout in this film. And you realize that considering this is the fourth installment (three now with her), she has to up the ante on her abilities, especially when you have Resident Evil: Awakening coming out around the corner and we know that Milla Jovovich will deliver on her action.<br/><br/>The story leaves with a sense of another installment coming. Selene finds Michael for a moment, and then he disappears. So she has a new crew with her daughter, David, and Det. Sebastian who seem to head off to find Michael and to grow their coven. There were rumours that this may be Beckinsale's last installment. Let's hope not, because there's no one else who can play Selene and jump from roof tops like Beckinsale."

","Ever been in one of those restaurants that offers a big meal but instead of a 16 ounce steak, you get the 8 ounce instead, leaving you hungry for more? Underworld is great for what they show. During the ride home, we were left scratching our heads at so much of the plot details that were missing. For a feature film, this one was barely 90 minutes, which was a shock. We did not see the 3D version, but what we saw it seemed rushed and incomplete. The move starts abruptly, goes right into the middle, and the ending is about as brief as the beginning.<br/><br/>There is a plot, but it seems lost in the action, which this film has plenty of. The lab scenes look something out of the resident evil leftovers.<br/><br/>It almost looks like they ran out of money, rushed the production, and left it without the normal plot development and story line we have grown to love.<br/><br/>Selene and Eve both are hot, and for India Eisley, She puts on the performance of her life. As for Michael, If you were looking for the hot hybrid love of Selene's life, People will be very disappointed. Not only is he not listed in the credits shown here, but if you call 2 minutes maximum a performance, it was lacking. As Selene said, ""where's Michael?""<br/><br/>Besides the lack of a opening and a close, the middle of the movie is well done. Just look at this as a light dinner, rather than the full course meal and hope they bring more next time. If the movie had the great opener and close we have come to expect, this film may have been the best of the series."

They could actually release extended version of them all on DVD. It's a great series, my eldest son and I love them. Good action/sci-fi/fantasy series. I really hope they do come out with a 5th. We have all 4 movies and when you watch them in order it's an awesome series. Just wondering if there are books for each movie for more details, would like to buy them. So does anyone know if their coming out with a 5th, if so when?"

","When I was much younger I used to watch quite a bit of the sci-fi channel. I went through a phase where that was what I watched for many hours on weekends during the B-movie movie marathons. Among the movies I used to watch, the first and second Underworld movies were among them. Underworld has been a series that I have been pretty much apathetic of throughout the years, but when I heard a new one was coming out I for some reason became interested. I decided to go back and watch all three of the other movies, and when I was finished I discovered that the movies really did fit right in on the sci-fi channel. They may have been a step or two better than sci-fi original movies, but they certainly didn't lend themselves to anything remotely exceptional even in the arena of entertainment. While I did find them mildly entertaining, I was still did not see anything remotely better than run of the mill about them. They weren't B-movies, but they certainly weren't good either. This directly relates to the expectations I had for the new Underworld in which I was simply hoping for some decent vampire vs. werewolf entertainment.

","The Underworld, and The Underworld Evolution were slightly tarnished by The Underworld: Rise of The Lycans. However, The Underworld; Awakening was just plain and downright painful to watch. The addition of 3-D only made a bad movie come to your face. No matter what, it seemed the movie was filmed in one single room, and was more lie a first person video game. Think of the original Goldeneye .007 for N-64 in 3-D without Bond, and one level to play. I would only agree the title is accurate. You will need Awakening by the middle of the movie. Kate Beckinsale of course was gorgeous but everything about the movie...Plot, Persona,and Choreography simply will not do. I do not watch a movie and just because it is a film with avid followers, The trilogy was ghastly brought to a new meaning by making her a mother, which was random, and completely not what I wanted in the fourth film. It would be like making The Godfather Part IV. I would only agree this movie was as nourishing to the intellect as a photo of a parachute to a man plummeting 15,000 feet from an airplane."
"TheMovieDiorama","4","3","5","16 March 2018"," Underworld: Awakening has no bite and little to bark about.
","This is the pivotal moment of a franchise, four films in and you naturally question the legitimacy for another chapter to exist. In Awakening's case, it marks the gradual downfall for the eternal war of vampires and lycans. The two supernatural races have now been identified by the general population where a purge occurs to cull these diseases. During this time, Selene is frozen to which she escapes and investigates what happened during her time in cryogenic hibernation. Well...where to begin with this? The gothic production design flies away into the night and incomes the bland modern architecture of today's society. The consistent use of prosthetics and creature costumes have now been removed to make way for the over reliance of poor CGI, including horrific 3D gimmicky effects for the 1.76% of people who watch films in that visionary method. The low budget effects are incredibly noticeable during the transformation scenes and honestly belong in a SyFy film (no offence to that channel...ok slight offence). As the series progresses, the action increases and the depth of the oh so convoluted story decreases. It'll come to no surprise then that Awakening's plot is so thin that you couldn't see it with a pair of bright blue vampiric eyes. I can atleast mention that the action sequences are perfectly suitable and are entertaining to watch, particularly Selene obliterating werewolves at every angle whilst being shrouded in silver gas. Silly, but fun. Speaking of stupid scenes, there is a moment Selene shoots down an uncontrollable elevator with her dual submachine guns and exits the building without a scratch. Ten out of ten, A+, five stars! I am pleased to see Beckinsale back at the helm of the franchise, but with a disinterested supporting cast (particularly antagonist Stephen Rea) she couldn't quite save this bland mess. When the best moment is the credits song (told you Evanescence would be included at some point!) you know you have issues. But guess what!? They've set up another sequel! Yikes..."

","The underworld series has a lot going for it....as STORIES.<br/><br/>The sad fact is that they put a malnourished female in a rubber suit and hoped that this would somehow overcome the most problematic issue with the underworld franchise: Kate Beckinsale simply cannot act.<br/><br/>Now, granted, I like the female form as much as the next person....but unlike some, I don't see it as a replacement for talent. Give me a fugly girl with amazing talent (or at the very least, simply does her job well) and I will pick her over a pretty moron EVERY TIME! <br/><br/>The fact that my wife is very sexy is coincidence; I was attracted to her brain first! But this single issue has absolutely RUINED the underworld saga. As a good example: compare the characters Lucian and Selene in the first Underworld: Michael sheen of course plays Lucian and he is absolutely outstanding in it. Kate Beckinsale on the other hand is so wooden that you really just want to see her naked for the sake of getting SOME entertainment value out of what you pay to see the movie; she really is that bad.<br/><br/>This movie is no exception. She fell into a formula requiring little or no effort on her part and leaving us with a character that may as well have been a bit part.<br/><br/>Despite valiant efforts by the other actors, unfortunately Beckinsale makes this a non-starter and it is therefore utterly deserving of the 1 star rating."

It was not to happen.<br/><br/>Maybe it was the lighting or the ridiculous script, but even in the tight pants, Kate did not look juicy. I know it was not her fault. Then the ancient werewolves and vampires... were mostly exterminated by humans before the film even began. The result? A pathetic fight between vampire covens hiding like rats and a werewolf pack of increasing strength, all while the humans (which hunted them all successfully) pretty much stay out of the way.<br/><br/>Bottom line: the script made no sense, the actor play was bland and the whole thing was unsatisfying even at the level of guilty pleasure."

","First of all, I was an Underworld fan, and I particularly loved Underworld and Rise of the Lycans. I loved that they were not just typical action flicks that you forget in a minute, but makes you think. At first, vampires were shown to be the 'good' ones while Lycans were evil creatures that had to be destroyed. But it proceeded to show us another side of the story: the Lycans'. Lucian's sad story and the vampire elders' made us rethink our stance. There was no fine line between the good and the evil. At first when I saw the plot of Underworld 4, I thought, 'Hmm, maybe the Lycans and the vampires will unite for once to fight against humans. Maybe they will finally learn to accept each other, overcome their differences and coexist. But I was extremely disappointed just 15 minutes or so into the movie. It was clear that the directors were determined to portray Lycans as the bad guys when it was clear that it was Viktor (the dead vampire Elder who started the war) and the Lycans had to fight back to protect their own species. This was garbage, and I was so sad that Underworld had been 'contaminated' by mindless action flicks nowadays. This movie would surely be disappointing to Underworld fans who were hoping to see something more meaningful and exciting than some regular action flick you can see anywhere. The only good thing about the movie was Kate Beckinsale, who is still as gorgeous as ever. A few great gravity defying scenes of her. But that's about it. <br/><br/>Please find a better director."

Yes I know, Victor lost half of his head and all that but if Sigourney could have been cloned from a drop of blood in Alien III then why not Victor? Bill was for me what made Underworld so great, shame he was not part of the latest instalment.

The so called fans that complained must not be understanding the story line...<br/><br/>Here's a break down if you want linkage to previous movies: At the end of the 2nd one, with the death of Corvinus and his men, there was no organisation left to ensure the Lycan and Vampire races remained hidden- hence the premise of this movie of humans finding out.<br/><br/>Now Selene, awaken after 12 years into essentially a ""post-apocalyptic"" world for the Vampire Covens and Lycan Clans. She is essentially all alone, being hunted and trying to survive and find out what is going on and what has happened. So yes a very simple plot, making this more of an action film.<br/><br/>The previous movies might have been more ""meaningful"" as the fans put it, but think of the timeline. The previous movies were set in a period when the Covens and Clans had existed for centuries, have established ""power-bases"", are ""hidden"" from humans, they are immortal and can take the time to plan ""slowly"" reflect on stuff etc. The first movie is the conclusion of a 600 year old ""plan"", so yes there is going to be more back story and history to it, compared to one that is only 12 years old...<br/><br/>I for one am looking forward to the next movie.

The survivors go underground, and hot vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) gets caught, waking up 12 years later in a laboratory. The key new plot element here is that she now turns out to have given birth to a daughter ( a vampire/lycan hybrid like her father Michael), which means that scientists are looking to harvest her and, well, it's tosh, isn't it? <br/><br/>But it's quite entertaining tosh, and it goes in enough of a new direction to keep you interested.

I will not however, even spend $2.99 to rent Awakening.<br/><br/>The movie starts out with a quick recap of the first two movies then introduces the the ""plot"" of this movie: the humans have found out about they vampires and lycans and are on a mission to destroy them. Since Kate Beckinsale was the only returning cast member, but Michael clearly should be a big part of the sequel, the writers kind of keep him in (with a different actor), but it feels very clumsy and forced.<br/><br/>I saw the 3D version accidentally, and it was in fact a mistake. The 3D effects were virtually non existent; it would have been better in 2D.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this movie has nothing to do with the original movies (except that Kate is in it) and has basically no character development.

","Underworld: Awakening is easy enough to like. If I didn't leave the movie theater with the feeling like I had just been ripped off, it might have received a slightly better review. The truth is, despite the utter lack of a storyline, this movie is enjoyable. As the movie carried on, I couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen next. Then it ended. Many movies nowadays are 90 minutes. Movies that short, however, are usually weak seeing as they don't have the time to develop a storyline. A movie usually needs to be about two hours or more in order to develop a decent storyline.<br/><br/>Underworld is 80 minutes. All movie websites say that it lasts 90 minutes. Why? Because it extends its credits into eternity so that the general public doesn't realize that they are about to pay full price for a movie that hasn't even been completed. Meanwhile, it presents a half- developed storyline that is drowned out in action sequences. When it is all said and done, I can't help but wonder if the storyline was even necessary at all.<br/><br/>Underworld: Awakening presents itself well from the beginning. The quick recap of events makes it unnecessary to be a fan of the series. It'll catch you up on all the basics. It hardly matters, however, since the storyline for this movie goes in an entirely new direction. I like the setup. But, about halfway through the movie, the plot bends in a new and all too predictable direction. Meanwhile, the script is so bare-bones that it is impossible to get a feel for any of the characters. Even the most important relationship in the movie—between patient one and patient two—is skipped over as if it were irrelevant.<br/><br/>This movie relies on its action scenes. This is what makes this movie fun to watch. Although there are several times where the special effects are lacking (the Lichen remind me of the unspeakable creatures from The Princess Bride/the girl reminds me of the girl from The Ring), the action scenes are generally fun to watch. Kate Beckinsale has the ability to make you feel like you really are watching a deadly ninja with superpowers. If she were handed a better action script, she would probably be able to make it soar.<br/><br/>Don't see this movie. The new directors—Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein— are caught up in the business of making a quick buck by ripping you off. The action is fun to watch, but not worth the money. If you are desperate to know what happens in the Underworld storyline, just wait until it comes out at Redbox and rent it. Don't surrender to Hollywood. You deserve better for your hard earned money."

It's a fairly generic run-off-the-mill Hollywood action/horror stunt. The plot could have been written for a TV-movie. It's unimaginative and predictable standard fare.

But basically, I liked it.<br/><br/>6,5/10<br/><br/>Underworld: Blood Wars (2016)<br/><br/>The latest installment in the ""Underworld"" franchise is by far the worst, but not redundant. ""Blood Wars"" rounds off this saga, but it does a rather lousy job, and the movie is reduced to eighty minutes of shallow action and two-dimensional characters that are there just to keep the story from staying unfinished. I don't want to recommend it, but again, you have to see it if you wish to know how the story ends.<br/><br/>5/10"

","As this film opens we learn that humanity as discovered the existence of the two non-human species, vampires and lycans, and set about eliminating both. Selene, the vampire Death Dealer, and Michael, the vampire/lycan hybrid and cryogenically frozen. Twelve years later Selene escapes and is united with a girl named Eve who turns out to be her daughter. She is wanted by individuals who believes that she holds the key to their research. The action that follows will see Selene return to the lab where she had been frozen and confront numerous super-lycans to save her daughter.<br/><br/>After missing the third film, which was a prequel, this film sees a welcome return of Kate Beckinsale as Selene; she does a fine job in the roll providing quality action scenes... as well as looking great in her tight fitting costume! The Story is solid enough; it provides some good twists and lots of thrilling action. Stephen Rea and Charles Dance add a touch of class as the Dr Jacob Lane, the films main antagonist, and a vampire elder respectively. I also liked Michael Ealy's performance as Detective Sebastian, a policeman who helps Selene, and India Eisley is solid as Eve. On the down side the CGI isn't the best and the way guns seem to be able to rapid fire a near infinite amount of ammunition without reloading is too silly. Overall I certainly wouldn't call this a great film but it is definitely worth watching if you enjoyed previous Underworld films."

Instead of carrying on the Micheal/Seline relationship, they muddle it by adding an annoying child who happens to have been born with an English Accent even though she's been raised by mostly American scientists.<br/><br/>Film makers need to remember that audiences are watching films to escape their own children, they don't want to watch someone else's bratty child whom just gets in the way of an action/adventure plot more than add to it.<br/><br/>(re: Zack - The Strain, Carl - TWD, Newt - Aliens, Dawn- BtVS).<br/><br/>The other problem with this addition, is the abandonment of the werewolves of the last three films and in its place are bad CGI weredogs.<br/><br/>Sometimes trying to one-up every addition isn't needed in a collection like this."

","2012's ""Underworld: Awakening"" is probably the most underwhelming entry in the decade-old-and-counting horror/fantasy ""Underworld"" franchise. The first ""Underworld"" (2003) had an interesting premise that played on long-established werewolf and vampire mythology, and ""Underworld: Evolution"" (2006) was a worthy continuation of the first film's story. The prequel ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" (2009) has so far been unseen by me, and tonight I finally got the chance to see the fourth film in the series, ""Underworld: Awakening.""<br/><br/>When I say that this film is underwhelming, I mean that it really doesn't offer anything new, except for really big action sequences and questionable special effects - which says a lot for a movie that cost an estimated $70 million to make (and that should probably make it the best movie in the series thus far). And Kate Beckinsale, as vampire ""death dealer"" Selene, is fantastic to look at in black leather and kicking a** all over the screen.<br/><br/>The film's plot is really all over the place, and posits that baseline humanity has since learned of the existence of rival vampire and werewolf clans, and has enacted campaigns to exterminate both species. Selene is caught in the middle of all this, and she is captured and cryogenically frozen for 12 years. She soon escapes to go and find her vampire/werewolf-hybrid lover Michael (Scott Speedman, in archive footage). But Selene isn't alone: she has a human cop named Sebastian (Michael Ealy) and a fellow vampire named David (Theo James) helping her out, and the mysterious child Eve (India Eisley) who also holds a secret that may have the future of both the vampire and werewolf clans at her disposal.<br/><br/>""Underworld: Awakening"" is very clearly the low point in the series, as directed by Marlind & Stein, who pump up the action and gory violence but also leave out the plot and characterization - which is really what made the first two movies in the series so great.<br/><br/>Best to just watch this one once to see what it's about, and then leave it at that.<br/><br/>6/10"

","This is continuing where the second movie left off (a few years later obviously). And fortunately for us Kate Beckinsale is back in action again. Unfortunately for us, the story continues to deteriorate further down the drain. Apart from a strong character missing (I'm guessing they'd try to get the person back for a future sequel, if there ever was to be one), this tries to bring as much fresh blood into it as possible (no pun intended).<br/><br/>Action choreography is good, cinematography is good and Kate is great as always. The new additions try their best, but unfortunately as intriguing as they are, this is very predictable fare and therefor not as entertaining as the previous efforts (minus the prequel that is)."
"grandmastersik","6","1","1","2 May 2012"," Great action... but too much missing
","The absolute roller-coaster that this film was is indeed its main positive, however, many a fan will likely be disappointed since Michael doesn't feature (for the most part) and there's very little internal struggle for the leading characters, which is what made the original so darn excellent.<br/><br/>Then again, I like full-on, in your face action, so won't complain (especially with the sour taste of recent vampire love stories still in my mouth).<br/><br/>The Lycans are back (although the beginning would have us believe differently - don't worry, this isn't a spoiler) but this time, they're apparently not the main enemy of Selene... nor is it her fellow vampire.<br/><br/>The opening ten minutes of this film sparked a genuine interest of the series going in a new - and welcome - direction, and between the thick fog of gunfire, I could've sworn that the producers were going for a more thriller route, but as the action REALLY kicks in, I was so glad that they didn't.<br/><br/>I won't ruin the incredibly thin plot with an outline of it, and it's probably best to see this kind of on-the-fly action-thriller without much of a clue anyway (hell, it's an Underworld film - isn't that reason enough to watch it?), but minus the END TITLES which always count towards a film's running time, this one was a very disappointing 1 hour 15 minutes (75 mins!!!)... and believe me, despite all the action, it feels like a chunk of the film was neglected too!<br/><br/>Over all, I enjoyed it, but as in my summary, there was a big gaping hole come the ending, and where I couldn't quite pin-point what was missing, I'm sure most will feel that it was somewhat lacking also."

","First I would like to say that I'm I Big fan when it comes to Vampires movies and have always enjoyed the Underworld series. Sure its low budget and cheese and so on. But its just mindless vampire fun and I was really looking forward to see Underworld: Awakening. That being said, Do not spend your time on this horse sh**!!!! The Budget has like gone down to nothing, the effects suck monkey balls and it feels like they've never done more than one take per scene.<br/><br/>Seriously its weird, like one scene where Michael Ealy has gotten hurt and is trying to get up. It looks like he's rehearsing. And the lycans, In previous movies the lycan suits have always looked a bit fake but in this movie they're in a whole different category. It seems like they've just splashed some grey paint on the actors and then given them an over-sized ugly ass hell lycan head, making them look like, well, like actor with an over-sized lycan head and some splashed grey paint. If I didn't know any better I would have guessed Uwe Boll was the reason why this turned out the way it did, thats how bad it is.<br/><br/>The list of reason why not to watch this movie goes on but I think my point has been made.

I also liked the new story line that they added and are now going to build off of. I just wonder when the release date for the next one will be. There is not so much new monsters but there are better and cooler looking ones. The fact the vampires, lycans, and humans are all fighting each other makes the movie even more crazy.

","Aside from a brief appearance at the end, latex-clad Kate Beckinsale sat out the last ""Underworld"" outing ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans."" Basically, ""Lycans"" served as a prequel to ""Underworld"" and its swashbuckling sequel ""Underworld: Evolution."" In other words, the ""Underworld"" filmmakers leaped backwards to explore the origins of the franchise, and ""Lycans"" wrapped everything up in neat, tidy fashion. In ""Underworld: Awakening,"" pistol-packing vampire dame-in-black Selene returns with a vengeance, and she finds herself up to her pretty ears in new shenanigans that pose even greater problems. Sequels are usually measured by how much they develop a franchise. Bad sequels deliver nothing more than the same old stuff with nothing new to distinguish them. In the imaginative hands of scenarists Len Wiseman, John Hlavin, J. Michael Straczynski, and Allison Burnett, ""Underworld: Awakening"" takes the franchise in a fresh direction without undermining everything that occurred before it.<br/><br/>For the record, Wiseman helmed the first ""Underworld"" escapade, and he has produced all four of these exciting, suspenseful vampire versus werewolf sagas. ""Underworld: Awakening"" qualifies as Hlavin's freshman bow as a scribe. Anybody who has seen an episode of the legendary sci-fi series ""Babylon 5"" should recognize Straczynski as the genius who created that franchise. Meanwhile, Burnett penned both ""Untraceable"" and the remake of ""Fame."" They've furnished our trigger-happy heroine with a number of new challenges. Swedish co-directors Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein have taken over the helm, and the audacious action has neither been as fast nor as character-driven as this entry. You could say that ""Underworld: Awakening"" knocks the bottom out of the franchise. Although you have to contend with those cumbersome 3-D spectacles, this spectacle of blood, gore, and violence is definite worth the trouble. Mind you, ""Underworld: Awakening"" doesn't imitate those old-fashioned 3-D adventure that hurled everything but the kitchen sink at you. Sometimes, you get to see a little flying glass and some blood, but the 3-D manages to contribute to the action. The scene where a gargantuan werewolf slings automobiles at our heroine looks as cool as the scenes where the werewolf mutates from human form.<br/><br/>The chief difference between ""Underworld: Awakening"" and its predecessors is that mankind no longer stands ignorantly on the sidelines of all the mayhem. Co-helmers Mårlind and Stein provide a prologue that updates us about the radical changes that have transpired, in case you haven't seen any of the earlier epics. The fangsters and their mortal enemies the Lycans have fought each other virtually to the point of extinction. Now, they are battling mankind and humans have taken these monsters seriously enough to virtually wipe them out. Indeed, the best of the vampire Death Dealers, Selene (Kate Beckinsale of ""Much Ado About Nothing"") has been captured and cryogenically frozen. In other words, when she breaks out of cold storage, our heroine learns that she has been cooling her heels for more than a decade. A shady biotech film called Antigen has keep Selene on ice along with another subject. When Selene escapes, she discovers that the other subject who has gotten away, Eve (India Eisley of ""Headspace""), is none other than her daughter. Celebrated television talk show host Art Linkletter used to say that kids do the darnest things. Wait until you see what Eve does. Indeed, Eve is a hybrid from the union of vampire babe Selene and werewolf hunk Michael (Scott Speedman) and Antigen chief researcher Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea of ""The Crying Game"") has been grooming the little gal to act as a DNA donor.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the remaining vampires have gone underworld, including some of higher-ups, among them autocratic Thomas (Charles Dance of ""Last Action Hero""), who is content to hide out with the covens. No sooner has Eve escaped than Lane sends everything that he has after her and Selene. Although he doesn't have a major role in this adventure, Michael is still alive after an opening gambit that made it appear as if he were toast. The bulk of the action in ""Underworld: Awakening"" is Selene struggling to keep Eve out of Lane's hands and scalpel. Along the way, the bodies pile up and nobody has any qualms about pulling the trigger on anybody. When Selene isn't tangling with the humans, who are everywhere, she is menaced by Quint (Kris Holden-Ried of ""K-19: The Widowmaker""), a man who can shape-shift at will into a Goliath of a werewolf. During one sensational scene, Quint watches as Selene battles another werewolf at the bottom of an elevator shaft. Handily, he transforms his fist into a mighty claw and tears the cables holding the elevator car, several floors above him, and then watches with amusement as it plunges like giant anvil toward Selene. Of course, Selene survives this larger-than-life obstacle, but it is the manner in which she emerges that makes the scene as well as ""Underworld: Awakening"" so terrific.<br/><br/>Clocking in at a nimble 89-minutes, ""Underworld: Awakening"" doesn't dawdle. Beckinsale performs her acrobatics with the same poise that she dazzled us with in the first two ""Underworld"" shoot'em ups. Another interesting character who appears in this installment is Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy of ""2 Fast 2 Furious""), who survives the fracas because he can hit what he shoots at and he doesn't perform the usual stupid human tricks that most expendable cops do in these movies. There are some other surprises left for you, but you'll have to see the film to catch them. Meantime, anybody who enjoyed the earlier entries in the franchise should find ""Underworld: Awakening"" an eminently serviceable reboot of the fang & claw franchise."

Tricking people into believing this movie is something which it isn't, doesn't shine a good light on the studio or whoever launched this.

No. But we do have a perfectly fine popcorn flick that does what it intends to do.<br/><br/>Let's look at the flaws...<br/><br/>1.) CGI blood. Really, Hollywood? It doesn't look good! I will not blame the movie for this flaw, but Hollywood in general over the past several years. I can't stand it. It takes me out of any film. This being a bloody film, makes me cringe with all the CGI blood flying all over the place. Please folks, at the very least throw some good old REAL (fake) blood in there.

Werewolves vs. Vampires! Epic? It should be! 80 minutes is not epic.<br/><br/>3.) Werewolves on steroids (basically) ? Really? I love werewolves...but really? That's all I'm going to say.<br/><br/>Let's look at what's good...<br/><br/>1.)Kate Beckinsale is the ultimate eye candy. True, this may be a cheap shot on what makes a good film...but it couldn't be further from the truth. She fits that role oh, so well. and those pants...my god.<br/><br/>2.) The 3D is used surprisingly well! I wasn't expecting as much. I don't tend to visit films in 3D, but this pulled it off extremely well! It doesn't feel out of place, as it does with eighty percent of most films. Well done! 3.) This film falls on par with the others. It doesn't take a different direction, as it might do so when sequels are handed over to different directors. It's treated as the ""Underworld"" films are known today; A good old popcorn flick.<br/><br/>7 stars out of 10.

","I am not sure I understand some of the unfavorable reviews--especially those with 1 or 2 stars? I do not think anyone will (or should) take your review seriously if you give this movie 1 star--I know I certainly will not. I really do not understand what some of these people think they are going to see--this is NOT a ""deep"" intellectual film like ""Let the right one in"". When you go to see an Underworld movie, you expect to see a film well acted (it is) with its heroine (Kate Beckinsale) continuing to struggle with what she is (undead) and what she wants to be (human) and ultimately having her human side prevail as well as plenty of interaction between vampire and Lycan. The film is not without its flaws of course (which is why I gave it an 8). But I've seen so many films in this genre that just are not entertaining or well done. This movie will not win any acting academy awards, although I think Kate was great. If you have enjoyed the previous films, you will certainly enjoy this one as it is the best of the four films made. If you have not seen any of the prior films, but you like either action or vampire/werewolf films, you will love this one. If you come in expecting a movie like ""Let the right one in"" you will probably be disappointed. Again--don't give a movie a bad review because you wanted something different. I think if you go in to this movie you should know exactly what it promises to deliver and it delivers that well and you should rate the movie on that basis, not on your view of what you think the film should deliver. Giving this film a rating below 5 or 6 does a disservice to the film as well as people reading the reviews when trying to decide whether to see the film."
"Jax0524","7","4","9","22 January 2012"," A start something new
","I am neither disappointed nor completely impressed by this film. The film was short but it was very fast paced which made up for that. But overall I felt like I was watching a prologue to a possible 5th underworld film. Kind of like the opening intro in Underworld Evolution. I went with my brother and as we watched it he asked me with extreme sincerity ""when was the movie going to start?"" and I was feeling the same way.That doesn't make the film bad it just felt unfinished to me.<br/><br/>There was a lot of worry over Scott Speedman not being in the film. Quite frankly I didn't care either way. I don't care for Speedman's character, Michael. I didn't care about him in Underworld, I didn't care about him in Evolution, and I still didn't in Awakening. As a character he's a disappointment. In Underworld he just served as a plot device and a forced love interest for Selene.There was all this talk in Underworld about this ultimate creature, a hybrid (vampire and werewolf)and once we get it, its pushed off to the side like a piece of furniture. Michael was supposed to be this bad ass force to be reckoned with and yet Selene still overshadowed him. His character is so under developed that I cant bring myself to care about anything that happens to him.<br/><br/>I like Kate Beckinsale's Selene, absolutely love her character. Now I know I just stated that I don't care about Michael. Let me rephrase: I only care about Michael because Selene does. Even though Im not a strong supporter of their relationship, because I like Selene I wanted her to find him and get him back.<br/><br/>I also get the reason why Michael wasn't in this film because they were trying to establish the mother daughter relationship with Selene and Eve and for Michael to be there it would disregard that aspect. So Im cool with that. Selene also feels more emotional in this one as well which I liked. You get a sense of her realization of her connection with Eve and this new feeling of having to protect her at all costs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately we never get any explanation of how Eve came to be. Selene is captured one day and put in a cryogenic prison and 12 years later poof there's Eve. We're left with only speculation that Selene was pregnant at the time of her capture or Eve could possibly be the genetic splicing of Michael and Selene's DNA, a clone, an alien. hell,we don't know. But just go with it.<br/><br/>I hope if there's another installment that we will expand more on Eve's character. I would hate for her to get pushed off to the side like her daddy. She was such an awesome character and they could definitely start a whole to franchise with her."

Resemblance to the TV series ""Believe"" (and the girl did look a little like Bo) kept my interest. The cameos by local (to the UK) Thespians was a bonus. Everyone was attractive, the action was great, the soundtrack was punchy and it looked good throughout.<br/><br/>Yes there may have been some goofs in there, but I wasn't looking for them as I was just enjoying it as pure entertainment and not being picky!"

","Things go wrong here in the Underworld franchise. Only Selene, and a small part for Michael, is to be seen from the original cast. It do involves vampires and lycans but i just couldn't care for Awakening. <br/><br/>Selene here is more an superhero than a vampire. She can do things not normal for a vampire and not be seen in the previous entries. The story itself was a bit weak too, guess the producers just wanted to earn some easy money. Selene is involved with Michael in an explosion. She wakes up twelve year later in a world were mankind wants to annihilate vampires and lycans. Once awake she sees that she's in a laboratory. She soon discovers that she has a daughter, Eve. But the lab is in fact part of lycans who want to use Eve's body to find a cure against silver bullets. <br/><br/>I can agree that the story had to involve but don't bringing any cast from the last 3 entries is a fault for me. Also the fact that one lycan was a big monster was a bit exaggerated. If you want to see stuff like that then move over to the Resident Evil franchise. The effects on the other hand were maybe the best so far. But we are also a few years further than Rise Of The Lycans. It is still watchable but it moved too far away from the other flicks of Underworld. It do has an open ending so within a few years part 5 will be available.

","Exciting is a word i would attribute to the time spent watching paint dry, that is if the alternative was being told i'd have to sit through Underworld: Awakening again. After opting out of the third installment of the Underworld series, Kate Beckinsale returns as ice cool PVC clad vampire Seline in this tired fourth outing. In case you missed the previous Underworld films, (you really didn't miss anything) we get a recap introduction designed to bring you up to speed, and then without further ado it's headlong into the typically dingy looking, mind numbing action. By now anyone who's followed Underworld, knows just how adept Seline is at stylishly offing bad guys. From power sliding while simultaneously firing two automatic handguns, to gravity defying gymnastics it's all gotten very old, very fast. What's designed to be exciting is 'by the numbers' boring, as the almost non existent script meanders from witless exposition to the merest of character development. Seasoned actors Charles Dance and Stephen Rea show up to try and inject some heft, but nothing detracts from just how dull it all is. Beckinsale looks great, and as always she's suitably nimble but it's nowhere near enough to hang a film on, which is essentially what the producers are trying to achieve. With a budget of $70m and a global take of $160m, this is a series that seems to endure despite being as thin as the latex wrapped around it's protagonists tiny frame. With that in mind, more sequels seem inevitable. Where's that drying paint again?"

","I gave this recent addition to the Underworld series a couple of points purely because it has extended the story line for me somewhat, and I got to see a couple of the characters again for a few moments. It really doesn't deserve much more. <br/><br/>The CGI, was Ghost-buster level at best... with extremely fake looking werewolves, blurring across the screen in hairless digital plastic-ness.<br/><br/>The story line went no where, was obvious from the very start, and jumped from moment to moment with no subplots or clever twists. The vampires were pitiful creatures, which I get is due to the plot, but they were awfully pretty and plain looking, not Vampire style at all. With the movie sprinting past any real plot, there were no close ups of context, ie: other characters clothing, conditions they were living in, reactions to events unfolding. But it was obvious no money had been spent on this, attention to detail was nonexistent. The humans that they were supposed to be fighting, were all carbon copy guardsmen or NCSI style policemen.<br/><br/>I have to ask the obvious question, did all the money go towards making it 3D? Because truly it wasn't worth it. <br/><br/>I was an avid fan of the previous films and just feel like pretending this one didn't happen.<br/><br/>I mean I swear at one point they were using an ice machine!"

","Soon after finding myself excited, only missing a certain finesse ten minutes into the thing, upcoming B-movie stupidity quickly devastated my hopes of this turning out to be a straight forward, crystal clear, quality action flick. Besides delivering a promising kick-off and a thrilling finale (both prolonged action scenes with Kate Backinsale kicking some ass) neither of directors Mans Marlind or Bjorn Stein nor writers Allison Burnett or Kevin Grevioux really manage to deal with anything in this movie, including characters exchanging two lines of consistent dialog or wrapping up the most simple scene. While there is a certain flair (mainly established by the preceding Undeworld movies) present, I'd need to search my mind for a while, to mention three other movies showing off so little talent from side of their directors or writers."
"homecoming8","3","3","6","7 May 2012"," Terrible And Sad; Like watching a Video Game instead of a Movie !
","2003's ""Underworld"" was a surprisingly well made action-horror-adventure movie. The effects were amazing and the action sequences were cool, slick and perfect, not seen since ""The Matrix"" (1999). It also had an interesting story. ""Underworld: Evolution"" (2006) was an OK sequel, again with great effects and action but the story was not as good as the original. I was afraid the third entry, a prequel without Kate Beckinsale, would be disappointing but it turned out more than okay; it was even better than the second one. Kate Beckinsale returns once again in ""Underworld: Awakening"". This movie totally destroys the franchise: everything is wrong here. Lets start with the story: It's hard to sympathize with Selene's character (Beckinsale) since she now starts killing innocent humans. You do not care for anything since the story reminds you more of just another weak ""Resident Evil"" sequel instead of ""Underworld"". We do not see the Hybrid character (Scott Speedman) in person, but digitally implanted images of him, since the actor himself did not return. Digital CGI is just about everything you see: CGI blood spurting away, CGI persons being blown away and even CGI smoke to cover the naked Kate Beckinsale in a hilariously stupid scene. As cool as the action was in the original ""Underworld"", as lame and fake it all looks here. For every decent effect or action scene there are a dozen bad and terrible ones. <br/><br/>""Underworld: Awakening"" is a textbook example of what's wrong with today's movies: they start to look more like bad video-games instead of real movies. The story doesn't seem to matter at all, just throw in as many action and special effects as possible in the most cheapest way possible: budget restricted, average CGI effects. Shame on everyone involved here, this is an insult for all the fans of the series. Beckinsale still looks sexy in her tight leather outfit but that's hardly worth 90 minutes of your life. Watch the original one again instead and forget there ever was a fourth one."

","Unfortunately for the Underworld franchise, the murky and bleak poser-goth atmosphere of the early 2000's, and the legacy of the overly saturated camera filters and brick wall acting (passed off as badass) that was ""inspired"" by the Matrix films, came and went 10 years ago, barely coincides with teenage angst anymore, lacks the overpopulated nu metal scene for a soundtrack, and it's left all alone with the last of it's kind, which is the annoyingly persistent Resident Evil series. Even if it was within context of the time that it was once relevant, that wouldn't change how generic and same-old this useless addition to this boring and lame series is."
"Sweetnesstoyou","Null","3","6","7 March 2012"," Worst installment
","I am very disappointed in this film. I have a couple of grievances that I need to get off my chest. First I am very upset about the running time of the film. it is only an hour and 15 minutes long. I was highly upset to pay full price for this movie and it was only 15 minutes longer than a TV drama. Being that the movie was so short the plot and everything that went into it felt rushed and the dialog except for some AWESOME lines were sub-par. I felt that us fans deserved a little bit more meat on the story; the very short movie time defiantly curtailed that from happening. Second- I hated that there is no sense of time in this movie at all. they say that it is 12 years in the future but everything looks unchanged and not advanced. Take something from 12 years ago and see how it has changed; that change is nonexistent in the movie. Third- I hated the Ending, besides the fact that it ended SUPER quick, it was left very open. The Actors are getting older, they don't necessarily want to be doing Underworld for the rest of their careers and the movie Pops up every 3-4 years, This series need one more movie to tie up all loose ends and have the fans say goodbye while going out with a BANG! When a movie has 4-5 installments things start to get dicey, Underworld with this film is starting to show its age. <br/><br/>All in all if you are a Die Hard Fan it is a good movie as far is action, but it is lackluster in storyline and movie feel."
"nightmare_lady","2","3","6","2 March 2012"," Selene comes back... as a bitch!
","... I know indiscriminate murder seems to solve most problems in these flicks, but I had no idea 12 years of cryo treatment turned someone into a bitch.<br/><br/>Because that's what Selene is in Underworld: Awakening. Indiscriminate murder seems to be her answer to everything. I know love makes people blind, but Selene was always level-headed in the previous movies. Amazing combatant, but always rational. Here, she's on a killing rampage. Evidently ""incapacitation"" isn't in her dictionary. <br/><br/>The story itself is unremarkable; no twists, no revelations, no lasting impacts. The action is the same too; flying through air, jumping, twirling, pirouetting. It seems like Resident Evil gone vamp; but we already have Resident Evil for that kind of action, and Twilight for Werewolf/Vamp love flick, rendering this movie pointless.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale definitely aged, and that shows. She is no longer the cool-headed assassin that we all knew, but rather this bloodthirsty bitch (sorry for the repetitive expletive, but I lack the proper word to describe her as anything else) who seems to think stabbing people indiscriminately and killing them will get her to her goal. Some of her kills seem utterly pointless, and I ended up feeling more for the ""baddies"" who end up getting killed than Selene. That's not a good sign for this kind of action movie. There are almost no humane interaction between Selene and anyone either. It almost feels as if I'm watching Kate Beckinsale do gymnastics in the air in black spandex with blood spewing about. <br/><br/>I have absolutely no idea what they were thinking when they wrote the script, but they were certainly getting lazy with one-liners and lack of dialogue. Save an hour and half of your time and go watch the 1st Underworld. Then the 2nd. And then the 3rd. And stop there."
"MajorBaleegh","Null","3","6","29 February 2012"," What a movie
","Well after watching this movie, it can be easily judged that Ms. Selene; was the only one who would have killed every werewolf of the movie. The rest of the cast was there for nothing. More so, was Ms. Selene was made of plastic that she was thrown from here to there and she was not even hurt, quite a clumsy thought it was? It was a movie for a toddler or a teenager at max, not a movie worth watching for. Quite kiddish concept; Ms Selene pistol were never go empty after firing hundreds of bullets they were still firing, what is this man? Have some reality. I think this movie was there to increase the repute of Ms Kate, which I don't think is on the downward slope. One women killing the entire US police force what a shame for them, they should go home and hire two to three Ms Selene to do their job. Make a fiction but not that much that it looks like funny and you still think you have done a great job what a parameter you set to judge a movie. I gave it 2/10 and nothing more, totally a ridiculous movie!"

","What did you expect when you were buying the ticket? To see Kate Beckinsale back in tight latex outfit? You got it! To see ferocious werewolf comes to live in latest Special Effects? You got it! Or to feast your eyes with more absurd gun fighting actions? You got it too! Concisely, if you are a true fan of thiz saga, you will not have a problem to watch thiz installment one more time. It's another exact extension from the previous movies. But if you ask me, thiz movie is one of long excruciating experiences I have ever had. I mean please to be frankly honest, in every character of every scene in thiz movie, you may have some feelings about how many times you have ever seen these elements in other movies. They take a little from here and a little from that and then they put it together in one screen. It's a boring copycat movie. Everything seems so cliché. ""My Heart is not cold, it's broken"". The Duo Directors who are responsible for all of these are Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein. Previously, they are known for ""Shelter"" in 2010. Beckinsale's performance as Selene has two opposite sides. On one side, she looks cool in some time. On the other side, she seems so frail and delicate. Meanwhile, the supporting Cast members like Stephen Rea, Michael Ealy, Theo James and India Eisley give typical mediocre performance. Selene the vampire knight has been fighting the lycans (werewolf) since the first ""Underworld"" (2003), ""Underworld: Evolution"" (2006) and one prequel ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans"" (2009). The mastermind behind thiz saga is Len Wiseman, the real life husband of Kate Beckinsale. Here is an interesting fact. In 2002, there was another couple had met and now they had become husband and wife as well. They are Milla Jovovich (Actress) and Paul W.S. Anderson (Director). They also made four installments of their own so far. It's called ""Resident Evil"" (2002-2010). I have a bad hunch about thiz franchise itself. There is no doubt. Thiz ""Underworld"" franchise has become a successful gold mine for the filmmakers. They will keep awakening thiz franchise as long as money keeps coming.

The only downside to the movie was the 3d. In a way I didn't think it needed it, they added noticeable textures as in glosses in the air. but it didn't really feel like I noticed it at all.

First, the two guns which shoots about 100 bullets in 3 seconds needs to get reloaded a lot more than they did in this movie, I mean it got to a point where I said, ""Really?"" Second they did some unbelievable things here like when David (Theo James)died she went into his stomach and squeezed his heart and it restarted? How about ALL the other dead vampires around him? Why not squeeze their hearts? <br/><br/>By the way Davids acting was not good. In this one she seemed to have to much strength but then when she could have use it she didn't. Now to her daughter... I like the concept of the girl but she was a little to creepy, she kinda looked like a cross between the scary girl from the ""The Ring"" (2002), ""The Grudge""(2004) and a vampire. I also could not help but notice that the whole script reminded me of ""Resident Evil""<br/><br/>Well this is why I gave it 7 stars. The first ""Underworld"" is still the best worth 9 stars."

A story more elaborated like in this screenplay: http://slepacusmiticus.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/underwold-4/ But lets get back to the movie, Selene was awesome like always, but I missed the absence of the hybrid(Michael), and also what i didn't like was the fact that the creature of the night like i like to call vamp & lycan are portrayed as pussies, there where so many possibilities but the movie/screenplay fails at showing us a real dangerous and malicious archenemy, and I say that a strong villain is the major thing in any story. Only thing you see is the sexy vampire, Selene and that's all. <br/><br/>Now about the girl of who's name i forgot(Eve- ain't goth-ish nor memorable) i would like to say her acting was bad, instead i will say her character was week... didn't really needed to be there, what she does could be done by a traitor/vampire worshiper infiltrated... her pain isn't that well shown... only a beast rage, but teenage under stress act so un-logical and so many times teens get the rage inside or turn against themselves... this is what i didn't saw... instead showing her as a beast when enraged she should be shown as a aristocratic queen who hits efficiently in the right spot like his mother does.<br/><br/>There was a male character more but he was there only so that main character would not do monologue/speak for themselves.<br/><br/>Because the movie ended in ""to be continued"" fashion i really hope it will be a more elaborate story, more cool gothish scenery and more emotional madness... the girl would be perfect for such a thing, but the writer has to give her that role... and the presence of Selene/Kate the hotness of Underworld franchise."

","This film is packed with action and suspense. It has the original actress who played Selene (Kate Beckinsale), but sadly not the same actor who played Michael (Scott Speedman). Fortunately, Michael does not get much screen time, so it's not so bad for you Speedman fans. <br/><br/>The action is pulled off like it was in the last three movies, so if you liked the action of the first three then this will not disappoint. <br/><br/>As with the first three, the storyline was also very interesting (I will not tell you it as I believe it will be more fun for you to see it than read it). Though, as with some of the early installments, there is some inconsistency sprinkled throughout.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I have is that the directors turned Selene decidedly pro-vampire/anti-lycan. This is undoubtedly untrue to her character development. I won't say anymore than this, so as to avoid spoilers.

","I am NOT one who will walk out of the theatre and proclaim this sequel is the best one of the series simply because it's the freshest in my mind. Despite on how long it's been, I always remember how I rank franchise entries and I always remember ""The Classics"" – generally, but not always, the first chapter.<br/><br/>That said, I did that with 'Underworld: Awakening.' (8/10 Stars) I walked out at the end and exclaimed: This was the best of the series.<br/><br/>Sure, it helps that I'm not a fan of the Underworld films and that I pretty much only love both the character of Selene and the acting of Kate Beckinsale in the role. But, beyond that, this movie brought to the table a few things that made it better than the previous installments, such as no more ""ancients"" story lines, more action and no more Viktor! In addition, the action was intense, the vengeance in Selene was real, raw and fun to watch and had one of the best climatic final battles in my recent memory. (Even the great 'Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol' reached its peak in the center of that film.)<br/><br/>Did I mention, along with some pretty good lines (""I'm counting on it"") and a very nice take on Selene's machine gun escape route, it's a swift and needed 88 minutes? After the film's original way-too-long 121 minutes, the series has progressively gotten shorter. I will NOT complain about this; the story and sometimes unintentionally humorous werewolf CGI cannot sustain more than a buck and a half of screen time.<br/><br/>Now the movie's not perfect, mind you. Story, eh. Predictable, yep. And the 3-D was anything but worth it. In fact, this would be high on the list of 3-D-haters who complain it's only added to make a tad bit more in revenues.<br/><br/>On the same note, however, the IMAX was welcomed. Its sound was deafening – in a good way, and the grand scale was nice. I don't think you can have one without the other, so we should (ah-hem) suck it up and pay the extra just to see the fighting vampires on IMAX.<br/><br/>Selene returns (Thank you, Kate!) and with a cold-hearted (or is that broken?) vengeance. After the world's now aware of vamps and werewolves and we promptly swept the cities to get rid of them, Selene's captured and frozen only to be awakened 12 years later. Still cold blooded – ha – she's p*ssed and NO ONE will stand in her way. In fact, she's SuperSelene, a big improvement on the already ass-kicking character.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away any of the film's ""secrets"" – though most will see them coming anyways, but suffice to say, she's on a mission and it's almost non-stop action until the fantastic 3-4-way fight out in the conclusion.<br/><br/>Okay, I'll give one awayconsider it a present to open on Christmas Eve: The actual ending, i.e. the last 30 seconds might as well had the world famous ""To Be Continued"" stream across the screen like from the 'Back to the Future' final shot. Me: REALLY? (For horror fans, this was also so incredibly integrated with the 'Halloween' franchise. Repeatedly to the point of why even bother when no sequel's guaranteed.)<br/><br/>Eh, get past that and see the movie. Even if you're not an 'Underworld' fan."

I honestly didn't know what to expect, but we got a whole new myriad of characters and almost non-stop action. There is less character development than previous entries, but we don't really need that for this movie. The CGI has improved from the first film and I liked the looks of the Lycans.<br/><br/>This film is not a prequel like Rise of the Lycans was and it takes place many years after the events of Evolution. After awakening from a deep sleep, she finds out about ""The Purge"" in which humans wiped out both vampires and lycans. Now Selene must escape from the clutches of humankind and save her species.<br/><br/>It's nice to see Kate Beckinsale back in the role that brought her onto the map. She is aging gracefully and still has the look of Selene. She can still kick butt too. The rest of the actors aren't that famous but I have nothing to complain about them.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a solid, action-packed addition to the Underworld franchise. This film is a change of direction compared to the previous films, but fans like myself should welcome it. I do hope they make a fifth film with Beckinsale back. I rate this film 8/10."

She's stronger than Superman, faster than Flash, more agile than Spiderman and she can fly. Why are we watching? We know she can tear apart an endless stream of gigantic werewolves (called Lycans here, not that clever) with ease. And she can outgun any paramilitary police force no matter how much manpower, armor or artillery they have.<br/><br/>On top of all her superpowers, she has these magic pistols that never run out of ammo. She must have taken hundreds of thousands of rapid-fire shots with these wonderful weapons. I wondered, again outloud, ""She obviously cannot be killed or defeated with all her superduper powers, and she gets the most amazingly powerful and concealable weapons on top of that. Wow! Can I be you, Kate Beckinsale?"" And, ""Who wrote this crap, a retarded, future psychotic, five-year-old?"" My sincere apologies go to the retarded, future psychotic, five-year-olds out there.<br/><br/>The 3D effects were good, but the novelty wears off fast.

I liked the fan service shot when Beckinsale was crawling around in the vent ducts though. That almost made the movie worth watching but not quite.

This one, for me, brought a breath of fresh air by introducing some new characters. I didn't see the gore as being anymore or less than any of the other movies but if you follow the plot, it is inconceivable that there would be none when the humans are trying to eradicate vampires and lycans alike. I thought it interesting they introduced a child with the traits of both given birth by Selene while she was kept asleep and fathered by Michael. I don't know why people wouldn't like this movie. I preferred this one to the third movie and they left it open for another installment. It did pretty well at the box office. Kate Beckinsale does a great job as Selene yet a fourth time.

"raziel871","7","3","7","18 February 2012"," Gets more right than it does wrong!
","As an action film the original Underworld was good but - very much in the shadow of the Matrix up until Underworld:Evolution.<br/><br/>The second picks up moments after the original, viewing both one night after another greatly improves the overall feel of the movies. The third, Rise of the Lycans was very clever stepping backwards into the lore & allows the motivations of characters such as Viktor to shine. Again once you have seen the third film, the first two seem correctly paced.<br/><br/>Awakening is different ..<br/><br/>The best way I can describe it is that Selene is like the T-1000 from Terminator 2 - relentless in tracking down the important child.<br/><br/>She is way cooler in this film, the taking down of enemies & smooth catlike landings from above show what the Deathdealer is capable of. At no point did I feel that she was being ""bigged up"" - the character was akin to say Ripley or Sarah Connor post asylum escape in the fact that the woman kicked ass!<br/><br/>I wish that the mother in her had emerged a little more although she explains this herself quite well so I can forgive them that.<br/><br/>I would watch it again quite happily but I feel that it will find its place properly once the next chapter kicks in. If you are an Underworld fan (which the box office takings show many people are) then it will do very nicely. It's almost like TV episodes where sometimes the big events need eps 1-4 to get to the meat of the story before they can unfold in chapter 5. Looking back you have you favourite episodes but they wouldn't have been possible without the others. Evolution is still my favourite as it is a chase movie at heart but is defo the 2nd act to Underworld, Rise of the Lycans you can watch anytime as the Sonja love story is pretty self contained. <br/><br/>Awakening is a good little action flick - it is kinda the Alien: Resurrection of the franchise but better. It continues the story well, I don't feel that it has hurt the series & it will be interesting to see where it goes next. The Blade series failed 20 mins before the end of the 1st movie & the only thing they could do in the franchise was keep killing Whistler to give Blade something to do. Selene at least continues to grow etc.<br/><br/>Even if the lovely Kate didn't return for the next one the third film shows that the story can follow other characters in the series. The daughter could pick up the mantle if required & you wouldn't feel cheated."
"DICK STEEL","7","3","7","2 February 2012"," A Nutshell Review: Underworld: Awakening
","I will not make any excuses. This film appeals to the religious fan boys who have been following the Underworld series since 2003, where Kate Beckinsale burst onto the screen in her now iconic tight black leather as a vampire Death Dealer firing her automatic handguns on all cylinders in what would define to be the aged old folklore of Vampires versus Lycans/Volves way before Twilight came to give a teenage saccharine romance in place of hardcore action. It gave rise to a sequel before going backwards to an origin film with the third installment minus Beckinsale's Seline, who was sorely missed.<br/><br/>Picking up after a quick recap of the first two films, we learn that the constant overt bickering between the Vampires and Lycans have gained the attention of the humans who naturally start a genocide to exterminate these horror film staples through fire and silver bullets. Selene and Michael (a stand-in for Scott Speedman who refused to reprise his role as the powerful hybrid) soon find themselves trapped, and for 12 years are housed in a research corporation facility known as Antigen that's experimenting on them to seek a cure for any known infection of humans either way, although head scientist Dr Jacob Lane (Stephen Rhea) harbours a more sinister intention beneath his fuddy duddy looks and demeanour.<br/><br/>Soon Selene gets broken out from her cryogenic state thanks to Subject 2 / Eve (India Eisley) her hybrid daughter conceived in Evolution, and they find themselves running from Lycan enemies and being rejects of the Vampire race given Selene's bad reputation of betraying and slaying her own kind in the earlier films. Mother and daughter soon get separated again and Selene gains allies in the form of David (Theo James) a fellow vampire and a human cop Sebastian (Michael Ealy) to get her daughter back, and continue in their search for Michael so that this dysfunctional, hybrid family can reunite once again.<br/><br/>I suppose you can guess by now the story's really flimsy, and being nothing more than perfunctory to allow a series of action sequences to be strung together, and compensate for what's been missing in the previous film - Kate Beckinsale's icy cool Selene, now being a lot more powerful since her transformation in Evolution. It's still pretty amazing to imagine how Beckinsale can breathe in all that skin tight leather, and deliver her fair share of slinky action poses and moves without her heart skipping a beat. It's a lot more grittier in directors Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein's version of the world and the fair share of gory violence shows the extent of just what's required to dispatch powerful enemies, given the one-sidedness with very weak vampires, and much stronger and meaner Lycans no thanks to an experimental serum extracted from Subject 2 / Eve.<br/><br/>And the action doesn't disappoint, especially for moments geared to exploit 3D since it was shot using the RED EPIC cameras in 3D. It's a lot more varied through the use of automatic weapons, silver blades, silver nitrate fragmentation units, and good 'ol fangs to puncture the neck, and even so, the new Lycans prove to be too much of a handful for one all-powerful Death Dealer. But some aspects could have been dealt with in a better way, with the Super Lycans being nothing more than double their size and strength, though worse would be Eve's transformation that looked a little bit like Linda Blair from The Exorcist having an Incredible Hulk moment.<br/><br/>The earlier Underworld films with Selene as chief protagonist had a lot more going in its story than this installment, given the references and thicker conspiracies hidden in the sins of the fathers, which ultimately had been resolved in the third film being the prequel and origin. This one doesn't have that need to flashback or reference those any longer, which may also explain a shorter run time, and the feeling of a chunk of missing storyline that had been staple in the earlier movies contributing to that empty feeling. It tried to parallel the relations of parent-child in Selene-Eve, Thomas (Charles Dance)-David and Jacob-Quint (Kris Holden- Ried), but these attempts were never fully explored, otherwise it would have provided some form of an emotional anchor or deepen the character sets a little bit more.<br/><br/>Just how this film can progress from here is anyone's guess, although like Superman 2 / Superman Returns, it comes with an extra baggage in te form of Eve and her near invulnerability and powers par none, together with Selene may make the proceedings a little bit stale and boring. But until that happens, the Underworld franchise should have legs similar to the Resident Evil franchise which is also due for another outing this year - films that cater to fan boys, not too much depth in its stories, with superbly crafted action and headlined by a sexy actress kicking a lot of ass in style. It has the sporadic sprinkling of brilliance, but otherwise a relatively bland affair if not for its charismatic lead."

","This was pretty much the bloody video game type of film that I was expecting. Kate is always great in skin tight leather (so disappointed in the no skin thaw out scene, however). I just wish the writers didn't write down or talk down to the audience so much at every turn. Maybe their main clientèle are morons but having the audience sort through a few nuances isn't the worst thing in the world. They spelled EVERYTHING out and it wasn't exactly a complicated plot. The CGI was pretty bad but the action was quite good. Shallow, messy, near nonsensical but fun... just what we all come to expect from the Underworld series! <br/><br/>PS-Is it me or are they ripping off Marvel comics with every concept in this film? X-23, Days of Future Past, Werewolf Hulk mixed with Blade... nothing original at all."

Plus the movie was to short. 88 minutes is barely movie quality or quantity. Kate was great. Looks hot as always. The story line was interesting. Could have been more. There should have been more coven related action, controversy. Would have fit the story line. It's just disappointing. They made a great film and then its like they said well that's good enough, or like I said they ran out of money. Could have been one of the all time greats. An opportunity mist. I which they would just re shoot the last 1/3, add some greater depth, and make it better. Star Wars always does this kind of strange re due stuff. Why not Underworld.

","I purposely got on here to write this review because of this movie. I thoroughly enjoyed the other underworld movies but this one really blew my mind. I thought that after so many series that there would be a drop off. It definitely raised the bar and i cant wait for the next chapter. The only thing that i would like to know more of is the origin of Nicolas corvinus. If they can they might even add in an alien origin which will definitely broaden the franchise. I definitely enjoyed the movie, the action scenes were stellar and even better than the last. It left you feeling like at any moment it could all end but somehow they survive. The directors did a good job in putting the viewer within the action. In some scenes it felt like you were in there fighting. They made good use of the viewer sense. The movie definitely pulls you in and never lets go of your mind until the end. Worth every penny i will add this to my already stellar blue ray collection when it comes out."

How could they blow off all the story lines and characters from the previous movies so quickly without it even making sense? <br/><br/>2. Michael should have gotten a bigger role in the story and should have been played by Scott Speedman. He was a leading character in the first and second Underworld movie, so you can't just write him off. <br/><br/>3. The plot didn't make sense. <br/><br/>4. The daughter looked weird when she turned.

","Let me just be brief, without over-analyzing this action movie: Kate = eye candy. And of course, the action was great too. There are no teenagers parading around the high school cafeteria in need of attention or love or exhibiting any angst. This isn't a convoluted, washed-down vampire vs. werewolf movie (uh hmm, Twilight series). It is what it is - pure action and gore from beginning to end. Oh, did I mention Kate was in it, gratuitously wearing tight leather, and speaking with her lovely accent? It receives a 9/10 because Scott Speedman wasn't in it - just his likeness, as this was so obvious with the multitude of camera angle and distance tricks, reminding me of the actor who filled in for Bruce Lee towards the end of The Game of Death (but the latter was just plain silly)."

It seems that humans tried to cleanse the lycans and both vampires.They have now been driven them underground. Humans, vampires, and lycans are also chasing for a hybrid child. In the end there are some great fight scenes that have you on the edge of your seat. If you are looking for a good action movie then this movie will fit the bill.

","Underworld: Awakening (2012): Dir: Mans Marlind, Bjorn Stein / Cast: Kate Beckinsale, Stephen Rea, Michael Ealy, India Eisley, Theo James: Awakening is exactly what I needed to do as dosing off became an aided friend during this visually well made mess. It regards the awareness of vampires and werewolves, but to viewers it is the awareness of money wasted on crap entertainment such as this fourth entry junk. Kate Beckinsale once again stars as this fanged bitch who has been captured and frozen. When she thaws out and escapes, she learns that it is several years later, and that she has a daughter. This is all about as much fun as having a grey wolf chew on your crotch while vampire bats flight in to suck the blood out of you worse than this idiotic film does your wallet. While the film is technically well made and directed, it is still just another opportunity to drool over Beckinsale in a black skin tight outfit that highlights her curves. Stephen Rea plays the standard mad scientist and his son transforms into a monstrous werewolf that bats Beckinsale about like a child's stuffed toy. Michael Ealy plays a detective who ends up helping Beckinsale so that she can share the blame for this film's dumb ass delivery. India Eisley as Beckinsale's daughter has her moments as the fearsome daughter but often she is as threatening as Simba in The Lion King. Theo James appears as a vampire ally to Beckinsale but who cares about this opposites attract crap here. The only ones who need awakening are the folks who keep churning out this junk as oppose to concentrate on more unique ideas. Score: 3 / 10"

Anyways....Kate Beckinsale as always did best she could but the film it self was tragic in my opinion and i'm telling that cause i'm a fan of underworld movies. So it's natural that i can't say opposite,it's not possible!!! When i first saw runtime of movie,understood that something might be wrong,,and after 20 min. or so i realized that this film was crap totally.

I was a fan of this franchise since the first part and still am. The story was very weak. it had nothing to so with the previous story lines they added a new unknown universe with the same character. The villains were boring. i have to say if you are not a kate beckinsale fan then you wont find anything special in this movie because the direction and story were not that strong.

"Uriah43","5","2","4","16 October 2012"," An Average Film in an Above Average Series
","Kate Beckinsale once again turns in an excellent performance as the Death Dealer, ""Selene"". Only this time, she teams up with a vampire named ""David"" (played by Theo James), a human police detective named ""Sebastian"" (Michael Ealy) and her young hybrid daughter ""Eve"" (India Eisley). As our story evolves, we find that the humans have now become aware of both the lycans (werewolves) and the vampires and they have launched a massive purge to eliminate both species. After several years of fighting the humans mistakenly believe that the lycans have been totally annihilated and turn all of their focus on exterminating the vampires. But while this was going on, the lycans were secretly rebuilding their ranks and 12 years later have reentered the war on the side of neither the humans nor the vampires. They begin by seeking out Eve for experimental purposes involving genetic manipulation. But in order to capture her they must contend with Selene. Anyway, having given a basic rundown on the film, let me just say that it had some good things going for it--and some not-so-good things as well. First, this picture has a great deal of action and computer graphics which the directors (Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein) use to keep the picture flowing at a very brisk pace. Unfortunately, there is too much action and not enough dialogue, which causes this film to seem a bit shallow. Another factor involved ""Michael"" (Scott Speedman) who was noticeably ""missing in action"" from this movie. Fortunately, Kate Beckinsale once again dominates this film and it is quite likely that she is the only irreplaceable person in this series. Along with that, I liked the addition of David and his presence also helped fill in any gaps that were missing due to the absence of Michael. On the other hand, I didn't care for the addition of Eve as I believe adding another ""hybrid"" to the story doesn't really add anything significant to this series. Likewise, the fact that she is a 12-year old kid takes a bit off from the ""sleek and sexy"" quality of past films. In short, this film had some good points, but it had some bad points too. As such, I consider this to be an average film in an above average series. Hopefully, they will realize some of these faults and return to some serious dialogue and plot the next time, instead of just relying on action and CGI to carry the film."
"Marc_Action","4","2","4","29 May 2012"," Unnecessary
","As a devote fan of the original Underworld, I've seen every sequel/prequel with hope that the franchise will live up to the original. NO SUCH LUCK! Seems every new installment gets even more unbearable than the last one.<br/><br/>Underwold: Awakening is no exception. And quite frankly, was very unnecessary. The Michael Corvin sub-plot has become weak and useless, and the fact that the little girl so vigorously hunted down by the government and lycans would turn out to be Selene and Micheal's daughter was no surprise. But what's more disturbing about this sub-plot is that it was confusing and went no place, and the chemistry between mother and daughter was absolutely non-existent.<br/><br/>Also, the ""we have superhuman powers beyond imagination, yet we are letting puny humans hunt us, quarantine us, and exterminate us"" is a ridiculous plot that has been done before - for reference, see X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) and the TV series, Heroes (NBC).<br/><br/>My hopes aren't too high for this franchise anymore, so please stop making trashy, unnecessary sequels. I do not recommend this film. Do yourself a favor and go buy the original, watch it over and over again and you'll still love it much more the 25th time as you did watching this crap the first time..."

I really believe that it was a buffer to keep people interested in the series until Kate Beckinsale decided she was ready or willing to make another Underworld. So that being said, I found this movie to be really fun, action packed and despite the flaws people like to point out, I genuinely enjoyed the movie for the simple aspects of originality for the film series and let the movie entertain me for it's entirety, plus hoping for the possibility of another..."
"kooty86","4","2","4","23 April 2012"," They should have called this movie ""The Destruction of the Underworld Series""
","The only reason this movie warranted a score above 2 was because the action was decent. This movie is a sequel to the first two Underworld movies, continuing the story of Selene and Michael. The film takes place twelve years after Underworld 2. I am not quite sure how to convey my disappointment in the plot without spoiling the movie. The truth is, if someone would have told me the plot before I watched the movie I might have enjoyed it more knowing that I wasn't going to watch an Underworld movie but rather an Underworld based action flick. There was very little thought that went into this mindless babble of a film. Instead of delving deeper into the Underworld we all love the writers decided to create a whole new world. An unnecessary action which was motivated by Hollywood's desire to make an easy buck by playing off of a successful title. Or maybe just cruddy production skills, I am not sure. I would not recommend this film to anyone who was looking for a good Underworld, and I stress UNDERWORLD, sequel. This is a poorly written and thought out story based on the characters and back- story of a good series. <br/><br/>I am honestly getting sick of the shallow content that Hollywood has been regurgitating over the past decade. There is no originality. What must have happened after the last Underworld movie was that when somebody was asked to come up with a plot for the fourth movie he/she must have thought that what they meant was, ""we want you to make a stupid action flick which will be based on Underworld and will effectively destroy any chance we may have to keep the fans happy and our names as creative writers alive... please."" The more I think about how much I enjoyed the story of the first three installments the more I want to hunt down the person who wrote the trash which was passed as a sequel and make him/her beg the entire world for forgiveness for disappointing us to the point that it hurts. The feeling I got the whole time I was watching was that no effort went into the film. First of all the movie was way too short. There was no dialogue. The portrayal of the Vampire leader of a certain coven was pathetic. I understand that the world changed and the point was to portray him as someone who has been running scared for a while but I don't think that that is consistent with the vampire psychology. And can someone please explain to me why vampires and lycans are running around turning all the humans?! THAT MAKES NO SENSE!!!! Why kill off your only food supply? Besides of which, the number one rule in all vamp movies is that they stay HIDDEN! Why, you ask? Gee wiz, maybe its cuz... hmmm... oh yeah! So that precisely what happened in Underworld Awakening doesn't happen! If there would ever be a vamp or wolf running around infecting everyone then they would be hunted down by their own kind to stop it!! DUH!!! Another point where I noticed laziness in the film is when Selene gets shot like 5 times in the back and then she takes her coat off and her shiny leather spandex body suit thingy is still nice and clean and shiny, without a single bullet hole. I guess vamps have regenerating spandex too.... <br/><br/>In short, I am mad at whoever was involved in this production in every possible way... but the CGI was cool."

If you have a chance to watch this movie in the cinemas in the best possible quality, just go for it because the movie is all about sound and visual effects and won't work that well on your home cinema or later on television. I would probably not buy a copy of this movie or maybe only if this was released one day in a collector's edition with all movies of the entire saga.<br/><br/>I have only seen the very first part of the movies back in the days and have been attracted to other movies as time went by. I checked this movie out thanks to the interest of my girlfriend and now I definitely want to watch the other movies that I have missed in the past years. From this point of view, the movie grabbed my attention and did a good job in one and a half hour of entertaining power.<br/><br/>On the other side, this movie is clearly weaker than the first strike in my opinion. It focuses a lot on the special effects and is a great action movie but lacks some thrilling scenes, some horror moments and some additional elements that would have helped to create a more profound story even though this movie may initiate a lot of viewers to get back to the series just like me as this movie can be understood as the beginning of a new era rather than a final chapter. The story is easy to follow but I missed some epic scenes, new and intriguing supporting characters and some mystic or mysterious moments.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a fast paced movie with some stunning scenes. It is filmed and mastered in a very professional way. It's a relief to watch movies like this in times of the Twilight saga that waters down the image of those fascinating creatures of the dark. On the other side, this is no essential masterpiece of its kind but a great movie to watch in your local cinema with some drinks and food during the happy hour with a lovely person by your side."

","Underworld: Awakening starts off so promising. I like the concept of humans finally discovering that these mythical monsters exist in their world, and it makes sense that their reaction is fear and violence. Making humanity the bad guys is intriguing, and at least with humans I could relax in knowing what their weaknesses are, so they don't take thousands of gunshots and survive only to be killed by a single knife to the chest. Likewise, it would be fascinating to see how the vampires and werewolves would have to band together in order to form an underground resistance to preserve their kind. Yet they completely skip over the entire war with humans. That's right, this movie makes the moronic decision to jump ahead 12 years to the point that there are only a handful of the undead creatures still in existence. While this might increase the importance of Selene since she's part of an endangered species, it also skipped over some of the most interesting dramatic things they could have done with this franchise.<br/><br/>This might be a minor spoiler for Underworld: Awakening, but they also don't really show a war with humans when we get to the future. Instead, it just boils down to the same mindless fights between vampire and lycan. I continue to find these battles boring because it is unclear why at one moment you can easily rip a skull in half, and then later you struggle to even stay alive against the same creatures. Also, the effects are just a joke at this point. The lycans look like old Ray Harryhausen stop motion creatures when they don't just look like 2-dimensional cartoons. I can't take anything seriously when I'm watching goofy monsters that look that bad. There are a few story elements that work in this chapter of the saga. I thought the bond between family members was interesting, and I will always enjoy Michael Ealy in anything. I keep wanting them to figure out the Underworld franchise and make something decent, but they continue to make films that are average at best."

"pintaxandre","5","0","0","2 March 2020"," It hurts... it's not even entertaining at times.
","I am a big fan of the previous underworld, especially the third, but this one, I could not enjoy it.
The film begins by taking a risk and introduce you to a new context where the humans learned about the two species of vampires and lycans. Problem: you do not get the explanation of how a secret that was kept for centuries is no more one. Worse, at the end of the movie, this wind of change is no more than the same ennemy: the lycans... That's what I call to shoot a bullet in its own foot...
I will however briefly state what I enjoyed in the movie and what worked in every movie so far: the decors that are beautifully staged and with a lot of inspiration to give the so specific ambiance of this whole franchise and colors and visuals. They are wonderfully done. Congratulations.
Now, the acting triggers mixed feelings for me in this movie because there are both good and bad performances, but that's not why I will remember the movie as bad.
The writing of the characters is so basic and insipid. It's truly a shame for a serie such as Underworld films that never have been masterpieces of writing, but managed to make the audience connect emotionally with singular character at least. There are also many plot holes that could easily have been avoided, had the film been 20 minutes longer.
The dialogs are basic and dumb as can be and a few scenes are made even worse by an horrible editing that cuts the scene right to the moment where an interaction between two characters should go on. That's very frustrating, but at least I can say that this movie doesn't lack pace, even if it's for all the wrong reasons.
Otherwise, a few jumpcuts and incoherences, but that's just detail at this point... They should have stopped at the third movie. It's a thing to want to continue a story with potential, it's another thing to execute it correctly. More is rarely a synonym of better with the franchises these last years."

The start of the movie was on fast paced just like It's earlier parts but in absence of good execution the movie fizzles shortly. The previous movies were violent and fast paced but this movie goes slow in between.<br/><br/>The acting is great by Kate Beckinsale and is supported nicely by supporting characters.

If this was going to be the last film, then it would have been wonderful to end it with the three of them embracing on the roof and a nice voice over to give us hope for their future.

"Chris_Pandolfi","7","3","8","20 January 2012"," This is What Happens When Humans Get Involved
","The fact that I liked ""Underworld: Awakening"" says more about me than it does about the filmmakers. I have to admit that up front, for I want you to read this review all the way to the end. From my perspective, the first and second chapters of the series were needlessly complicated and nearly impossible to keep pace with. The prequel film, ""Underworld: Rise of the Lycans,"" was much more palatable, not only because it achieved the right look for the material, but also because it told a much more focused story that explained many of the mysterious plot elements. Now we have a fourth chapter, and although it's about as lasting as dust in the wind, I think it represents what the series should have been right from the start: An escapist supernatural action thriller that gives us license to put our brains on autopilot.<br/><br/>One of the things the filmmakers did right was strip away all the unnecessarily detailed back stories that bogged down the first and second films. Reduced in time from over two hours to just under ninety minutes, we have a singular story that's easy to follow and process. It begins immediately after the events of ""Underworld: Evolution""; the vampire Death Dealer Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and her lover, the hybrid Michael (Scott Speedman), are on the run after humans somehow became aware of the centuries-old war between the vampires and lycans. It was never adequately explained how the war was kept hidden from humanity for all those years, and it's left a little obscure when and how they found out about it, but I suppose it doesn't really matter. An underwater explosion separates the two, and the next thing Selene knows, she's being awakened from a cryogenic sleep. She will soon discover that she's being held prisoner in a lab, and that twelve years have passed.<br/><br/>Why was she being held prisoner? It seems that humans decided to wage war on all supernatural beings once their existence was made public. A television montage tells us that one of the world's governments declared martial law, after which armies oversaw a cleansing â€“ an event referred to throughout the film as The Purge. As to whether or not this took place all over the world is something the film doesn't bother to address, which is just as well since Selene is the real subject of the story. Anyway, it now appears the lycans are all but extinct, reduced to a handful of diseased scavengers in underground dwellings. Furthermore, very few vampire covens are left. Any remaining creatures are either eradicated on site or unwillingly become the subjects of medical experiments. This is how we find Selene, where she has been dubbed Subject #1.<br/><br/>As soon as she awakens, she discovers she has the ability to see through the eyes of another creature, the one that set her free. Alas, it isn't her beloved Michael. It's an adolescent girl named Eve (India Eisley), who, like Michael, is a vampire/lycan hybrid. Could she be Selene's daughter? This possibility is generally accepted by the characters, although that raises a number of logistical questions that are frankly too intelligent for the likes of this story. For the sake of time and energy, let us assume that she is indeed Selene's daughter and move on with the story. Eve, known by lab technicians as Subject #2, has been the pet project of Dr. Jacob Lane (Stephen Rea), the head scientist for a major bioengineering company; true to form of doctors in movies like this, he wants to use Eve's DNA for his own nefarious purposes.<br/><br/>""Awakening"" is not as visually noteworthy as its three predecessors, perhaps because the tone has been altered to be more in line with sci-fi medical thrillers like the ""Resident Evil"" films. Having said that, many of the series' stylistic touches remain, not the least of which are the scenes of relentless action and special effects. Like her trademark skintight black leather suit, Beckinsale is almost never seen without a gun in each hand; she will repeatedly shoot at things, mostly lycans, and we will marvel at the number of bullets a single handgun can hold. When a gun isn't within reach, she will arm herself with a knife and use her super speed to run through lines of people, slitting them to death. And of course, she continues to flaunt her ability to jump from very high points and land smoothly.<br/><br/>Apart from Eve and Dr. Lane, other new characters are introduced. These would include: David (Theo James), a vampire who takes in Selene and Eve and is eager to fight for the future of all vampires; David's father, Thomas (Charles Dance), who isn't as eager to fight; and Detective Sebastian (Michael Ealy), a human who has personal reasons for helping Selene when Eve is kidnapped by a pack of genetically altered lycans. None of them are particularly well developed, but then again, they didn't really need to be. More of note is the fact that ""Underworld: Awakening"" is the first of the series to be released in 3D. Because the film was actually shot that way and not converted in post production, I found it to be effective, if somewhat dim (although not as dim as I had expected, which was a pleasant surprise). There's certainly no harm in seeing it that way, although I don't think the experience will be lessened if you save your money and see it in 2D. <br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"

Just a lot of anger and pain involved. She is fearless and it is amazing how this movie franchise can keep the same feel through all the films with the Underworld name. The last time I felt this way about a film franchise was with Lethal Weapon. Characters from the past reemerge and the back-story is told with footage from the previous films. This movie is awesome and shows off the unique capabilities that Salene has. I loved it and cannot see why others bash it so much. Kate Beckinsale is still as attractive as she was in the original with even more attitude than ever. This movie is a ""must see"" for those die-hard Underworld fans.

"MrGKB","4","2","5","14 July 2012"," In one eye and out the other entertainment...
","...is pretty much the nicest thing one can say about this fourth installment in the fangs-and-fetish franchise that is ""Underworld."" Kate ""Pearl Harbor"" Beckinsale once again assays what will forever be her signature role as the vampiress warrior in form-fitting black. Despite the guidance of her auteur husband, Len ""Live Free or Die Hard"" Wiseman, her performance takes her nowhere she hasn't been already, and the slipshod four-author script remains ample evidence of why this make-work project failed to generate much box-office excitement for any but the franchise faithful. Tons of action, loads of CGI and gore, the lure of 3D (yay!), and of course the tantalizing lure of Ms. Beckinsale's lethal dominatrix-in-disguise; you'd think that the prized audience of adolescent-to-30something males would have slavered all over this one. Apparently, they did not. So much for insatiable testosterone.<br/><br/>It's interesting to note that IMDb voting has declined both qualitatively and quantitatively as the franchise continued, yet the much smaller female contingent consistently scores it better (to the tune of a full half point) than the Y-chrome cadre, most likely due to the strength and self-confidence of Beckinsale's heroine. I find that somehow refreshing. Perhap the cause of female empowerment has actually won some inroads into entrenched paternalism and misogyny.<br/><br/>No matter; back to the film. As always, it's the script that drags this installment down into the ranks of dispensability. As almost always, multiple writers: questionable results. The key loss, I think, was Danny McBride as lead scripter; I'd be interested in finding out why he parted ways with his co-creation. I've always treated the series as a guilty pleasure at best, in which style surpasses substance (and often only due to a sheer deficit of the latter), but it held a certain campy charm that has finally dissipated in this recent entry. The finale assuredly promises a future installment, but I can't say that I'm anticipating it. I'd rather see what Wiseman has done with the retread of ""Total Recall,"" and that only barely.<br/><br/>Late-night boredom and/or fanboy viewing only."

The obligatory chase and shoot scenes; the shoot-outs in close interior spaces; the gathering up of clues as each sub-mission is completed.

How much could it have cost to shoot with him for a couple of days. He's not a big actor by any stretch of the imagination. That's why a lot of fans gave up on the franchise when part 3 came out, and you had another actor (which I admit playing a different role, but still lead vampire that is replacing the role of Selene's character) and why when you have a continuing franchise like this, you need to keep the same actors.

I feel the story does add some new potential depth to the character of Selene, as we see her take on the mantle of protector. This film was bloodier than the others for sure (I almost gagged once), and I am a bit surprised and disappointed to see her killing right from the start without hesitation. Selene's movements and actions are often over kill because yes, as I ALREADY know she is a REALLY strong vampire, but despite her size she still gets thrown around repeatedly like a rag doll.<br/><br/>I like the new main characters, and this new installment in the saga is just a dark, pretty and mythical as you could hope for from a Vampire movie in modern times.

","As a fan of the Underworld series I was both eager and apprehensive about this 4th installment but, as the credits rolled I had a smile on my face and had a good time. For starters, Kate Beckinsale is back in black latex returning as Death Dealer Selene. The story opens as man has discovered both lycan and vampire and Selene has been separated from Michael, captured and cryogenically frozen as the war to cleanse the world of these supernatural species is underway. When released 12 years later, Selene finds a police state where lycan and vampire are all but extinct and she has a 12 year old daughter who's unique nature makes her central to a sinister experiment. To save her daughter and her people, Selene finds herself with unexpected enemies and allies and that's just fine with her. At barely 90 minutes Underworld: Awakening is all about the action and there is plenty of it. It slows down to give us some story here and there and is surprisingly good at utilizing the time to move it along without stopping the momentum and the film does move quite fast. Selene is thrust into doing what she does best quite regularly and it is fairly well staged and gruesome at times. The only real weakness here is the CGI which was never very strong in this series. Otherwise it's a brisk, fast paced fun time which won't convert any new fans but, should please those there are. Sure we wish we got to know some of the new character's a bit better such as Charles Dance's vampire elder filling the void of Bill Nighy's Victor and Steven Rea's bad guy scientist with a secret is a fairly generic villain. But, there are enough gun fights, explosions, spurting blood and shots of Kate Beckinsale's perfectly shaped black latex wrapped butt to keep everyone well entertained till the final scene which hints that the sexy and lethal vampiress may not be hanging up her guns or fetish gear quite yet. And that's fine with me."

I seemed to be waiting for it to get going the whole time, I was still waiting when it ended. The special effects were good I suppose but that just didn't make up at all for the lack of story. The first three were so good though! Why do this? It's one of the rare occasions where each new film was as good as the last in fact to be honest the third one ( Rise of the Lycans ) was my favourite! I'd rather they just left it at that than ruin it by going on to make a rubbish sequel. Cannot fault the acting as it was good as usual and plenty of action scenes as these films are known and loved for but without the story behind it, pointless."

","The main problem with this movie is there is hardly a plot; it's mainly blasting guns. The movie barely lasts an hour because there isn't a story. The werewolves looked like bad CGI, they could have looked a lot more real.<br/><br/>In this film, Selene is caught and it's 12 years later. Subject 2 releases her and she finds herself in a lab. Humans have removed most of the vamp and lycon problem. She escapes and finds Subject 2, a young girl she has a special connection too. She protects her as the lycans want her too for her special powers. So, the movie is just a shoot between Selene and wolves and people. I don't get why they aren't using supernatural powers; otherwise, it means nothing that they are vamps or lycans. But, it is basically just shooting guns.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDITCT: Skip this one."

","I just feel disappointed by this flick. I liked the first movies of this series for their dialog and interesting characters (Victor, Michael, the old Corvinus, the mad scientist, the Lycan leader...). This movie has no plot, no surprises, no dialogs and no character development at all. I don't belong to the ""but KB looks so hot in latex"" faction but I liked her for playing the death-dealer that fights for truth and her race in he first movies, slowly finding her personal goals by falling in love with Michael. In this movie she was boring as hell. Ah...I have a daughter...oh...she got taken away by Lycans...so I go in, kill them all and take her back. Done. Fine.<br/><br/>Plot and character display totally fail here.<br/><br/>What bugs me most is the fact that a whole group of writers were involved here, at least one of them should have been able to deliver a mediocre story...but even over-hyped JMS seemingly had a writing blockage here... does anyone recognize JMS in this screenplay anywhere? It's a simple rescue the damsel story, the rest is guts and gore.<br/><br/>I might look into an upcoming 5th movie, but I guess this series has already crossed it's zenith and is going down, despite gross income and so on - at least to me, as a lot of action and blood doesn't make a satisfying vampire/werewolf/horror movie if the story is so naive and ""bloodless""."

"nyssenbuilders","2","2","6","22 February 2012"," I really wanted to like it
","I enjoyed the other movies in the series, and I had high hopes for this movie. In terms of action and entertainment value it did not disappoint. The problem was, that I just couldn't get past the lack of continuity and the cheapness of the production. For starters, the movie is set 12 years in the future (2024). It would stand to reason that technology would have advanced. However, almost every car used in the chase scenes was taken from a junk lot. The 1978 van that Selene drove in the one chase scene would have been 46 years old and the Lycans that were chasing her were jumping from the rooftops of one 50 year-old car after another. Even the medical van/ambulance driven by the bad guys was an early 90's Ford Econoline. The security system at the high-tech laboratory complex used black and white tube-type monitors like in the 1980's with a big red button in the middle of the panel marked ""Alarm"", like in the Sean Connery James Bond films, and the only mobile phone that I saw was a flip phone like the one I had back in 2002. <br/><br/>I may have been looking too hard but the special effects looked less believable than the earlier movies. This may be because more of the action took place in better light... the other movies had all the action in darkness and bad weather. The way the Lycans moved reminded me of a SiFi channel movie, and the Super-Lycan looked like Scrappy-Doo from the Scoobie Doo Movie back in 2002. <br/><br/>It just seemed like the budget of this movie was cut way back, none the less, there was plenty of excitement and action, and Selene was as hot as ever. The ending set-up another sequel and I'm sure that I'll watch it, this time my expectations will be lower."
"jon.h.ochiai","8","2","6","2 February 2012"," Kate Beckinsale Rocks in Underworld: Awakening
","The stunning Kate Beckinsale is back in skin tight leather spandex and kicking ass in ""Underworld: Awakening"". Kate looks amazing, sleek, and incredibly fit as Vampire Death Dealer Selene. She was not in the last ""Underworld"" movie which was an uninspired origins tale. In a shrouded conspiracy, Selene (Beckinsale) has been frozen in a cryogenic chamber for 12 years. When we saw her last: She had escaped with her love Michael, a true hybrid—both Vampire and Lycan, i.e. Werewolf. However, in this near future the humans now hunt down the Vampire and Lycan. Amazingly, Beckinsale as Selene has emerged as a feminist hero of sorts. Women in the audience cheered as resurrected Selene snaps off the elbow of her malevolent captor. Beckinsale is sexy, charismatic, and all vengeance in ""Underworld: Awakenings"". She does not take crap from anyone, and tears through a lot of bad men.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Screenwriters Len Wiseman and John Hlavin shade the touching maternal instincts of hero Selene with convincing Beckinsale. Selene discovers a mysterious hybrid child Eve (innocent and powerful India Eisley). Selene is immersed in the swirling conflict of the renegade Vampire Covenant and the genetically enhanced Lycan threat. She mourns her beloved Michael. She confesses to Eve, ""My heart is not cold. It's broken."" Wiseman and Hlavin effectively create Selene a cause to fight for with all her might—I would say soul, but she is a Vampire. She finds allies in valiant warrior Vampire David (strong and compassionate Theo James) and unlikely human Sebastian (stalwart Michael Ealy). The real menacing threat is enigmatic Dr. Jacobs (slick Stephen Rea), whose passion for apparent clinical science conceals an intricate conspiracy as well.<br/><br/>Directors Mans Marlin and Bjorn Stein broker a kinetic visual style and manic sense of action—making this the most fun ""Underworld"". They provide a sense of urgency sans a self-important tone. And the action is wild. Beckinsale uses lightning quick jujitsu moves on human and Lycan. She is so cool standing tall in flowing trench coat, firing off rounds of bullets at the bad guys. Beckinsale has become an accomplished action star holding her own. She has the spectacular battle scene taking on a ferocious Lycan with a blade.<br/><br/>Wiseman and Hlavin construct an intriguing premise surrounding the messiah-like hybrid child, and the future of Vampire and Lycan. Unfortunately, they don't play this out to its logical conclusion. This is a little disappointing. The ""Underworld"" movies have kept the mythology interesting in that they are like ""Romeo and Juliet"", but with Vampires and Werewolves. Here milking for a sequel may not have been too smart; primarily, because we are all for Beckinsale's Selene—wanting to see her mend her broken heart. Granted the insane action and gore are adequate distraction. The conclusion seems rather abrupt, and more a commercial decision. So I guess I will look forward to seeing Beckinsale don the black leather again in the next ""Underworld""."

Pedestrian chapter for the most in the vampires vs. werewolves franchise with vampire Selene (Beckinsale still hot kicking ass in a catsuit) awakens from a 12 year induced hibernation to discover her kind – and her arch nemeses, the Lycans – are now facing extermination by the humans – and the key to both their survival lies in the fate of a bio-engineered hybrid in the form of a young girl (ethereal Eisley). While the team of Swede directors Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein keep things at a lively clip – with the graphic bloodshed at full speed ahead – the film is a tad anemic in its structure and feels a new transfusion is necessary to keep the series thriving (again Beckinsale is worth the price of admission alone) even with the limited 3-D Imax experience (i.e. 'in-your-face' dioramas at best)."

","Once again, I feel like I should like the Underworld films more than I do. I love werewolves, I love vampires and I love Kate Beckinsales, plus the action sequences in Underworld: Awakening are pretty fun, but, overall, this movie just left me cold. It starts in the middle of a story and it ends in the middle of a story and there isn't much story in between. I just don't get it. Why don't I enjoy these movies?"
"MaximumMadness","6","1","2","17 January 2017"," ""Underworld: Awakening""- An interesting but middling installment in the cult fan-favorite franchise. Good fun, but shoddily written.
","""Underworld: Awakening"", the fourth chapter in the long-running cult action franchise, has been met with a relatively poor reception amongst fans of the series. And while I cannot endorse the plethora of highly negative reviews, I do have to comment that I can't help but understand the frustration. Because beneath the flashy visuals, outstanding action and another good turn from series star Kate Beckinsale... the film is just a very strange little footnote that doesn't quite fit in as well as it ought have.<br/><br/>The concept is actually pretty inspired and genuinely fascinating, taking a hard left turn for the series that should have injected fresh blood into the narrative. After all, Selene's story and indeed the story of the ""Underworld"" saga seemed well-defined and generally complete by the end of the second installment, ""Evolution."" We needed something dramatic to happen in order to justify its continuation. And I do think that in better hands, the new concepts and ideas crafted in ""Awakening"" would have been an interesting fit for the franchise. But it just doesn't quite come together. Mainly because it's such a jarringly different film and the script is highly problematic.<br/><br/>Quite simply... it just isn't the ""Underworld"" we remember so fondly from the previous three films. But I do think it has some value, even if it is a middling and mediocre revamp for the series.<br/><br/>Shortly after the fall of Markus, mankind stumbles onto the existence of the Vampire and Lycan tribes, resulting in panic and hatred from the general public. It soon becomes priority number one for the governments of the world to eradicate the non-human entities that stalk the streets come nightfall. Both species are hunted down by specialized task-forces, brought to the brink of extinction. Selene (Beckinsale) is captured and placed in suspended animation, and it appears her beloved Michael is killed in an attack. She awakens twelve years later in a high-tech research facility owned by a corporation called ""Antigen."" Escaping, she soon enough discovers that while frozen, she evidently gave birth to a young Hybrid known as Eve (India Eisley), and together, mother and daughter will be forced into a fight for survival... and eventually a struggle for vengeance, as Selene seeks retribution for the cruel actions that tore her life apart.<br/><br/>Directed by the duo of Måns Mårlind and Björn Stein from a script co-written by series creator Len Wiseman, if nothing else the movie is definitely visually exciting and endlessly stylish. It's certainly never a dull film, and it moves along with great speed and an urgent sense of pacing. Mårlind and Stein have a very interesting visual sensibility, and the film is consistently sleek and very modern, giving it an interesting sense of identity in comparison to the more stark and Gothic look of the other films. Their work in the action department is also a ton of fun, and the plethora of gun-battles and ferocious fight scenes are definitely a blast and a half to behold.<br/><br/>The cast is fairly good for the most part. Series star Beckinsale is wonderful as always, and the film gives her some good material to work with. Selene is at her lowest in this story, and Beckinsale gives the character a great sense of pathos. While he might not quite be an adequate replacement for Scott Speedman's Michael, Theo James is game for some action as a new vampire sidekick in David. Stephen Rea brings some class as an evil research scientist who runs the corporation responsible for Selene's capture. And I really enjoyed the small supporting role by Michael Ealy as a police officer who becomes an unlikely ally for Selene's cause. Unfortunately, I found India Eisley underwhelming as Eve, and I thought she was probably the weakest link. I just didn't buy her in the role- especially when she goes full-on Hybrid during a few key action set pieces early on, and she doesn't get nearly enough presence in the story.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, as has been the case with the series as a whole, the writing is quite wonky, and this is probably the most poorly-written film of the entire saga. The concept is actually very good and affords a lot of interesting developments for the world established in the series, but most of the new ideas at play are simply glossed over far too quickly to be effective. The set-up of the film- the vampires and Lycans being hunted to near extinction- should have been a much greater focus, but it's really only addressed in the film's montage-style opening credits sequence. Key characters like Michael are written off in the first act with barely a mention later on, which felt like a betrayal after his importance to the story and to Selene. (And that's not spoiling anything... it happens in the first five minutes.) And the film just moves too quickly for its own good. I also can't help but feel that the new tone and style established in the narrative conflicts a bit too much with what came before- it stops feeling like an ""Underworld"" movie within the first fifteen minutes, instead becoming a more standard and trendy revenge-thriller, which I found quite jarring.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, great action, good performances and an interesting idea mostly salvage the film, and it's still a good bit of fun. If you're completely in love with the series, there's a good chance you'll come out hating ""Underworld: Awakening"" for being such a mediocre follow- up. But if you're like me and enjoy the films while being able to admit that they're not high art and have their share of flaws, you'll probably be able to forgive its more obvious faults and enjoy it for what it is... non-stop carnage starring a character we know and love.<br/><br/>I give it a middle of the road 6 out of 10."
"bowmanblue","8","1","2","13 May 2014"," Great film (if you liked the first three)
","Okay, for those of you still wondering what Underworld is all about... it's about a war between gun-totting fit female vampires in tight clothes and big ugly werewolves. So, if you've seen any of the first ones and liked them. Then watch this. You'll like this too.<br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you think that women in spandex leaping off buildings while firing twin pistols at a monster that, deep down, you know has been added post production via computer is a pretty dumb premise - steer well clear.<br/><br/>Luckily, I enjoyed the first three and loved this one too.<br/><br/>Twelve years after Selene's last battle, humans have only gone and figured out that vamps and werewolves are real and hunted every last one of them down (apart from the ones they missed). Selene's been frozen in ice and studied, but, luckily, she gets woken up by... you'll have to watch the film and see. But, anyway, she's more than a little cranky and being prodded while in ice by humans in lab coats for over a decade. Luckily for her (and us I guess) she's defrosted right next to her famous black slinky costume and quickly puts it on and goes to express her disgust with humanity by a strongly-worded blog and some scathing tweets (only joking, she grabs the nearest knife and gun and starts piling up the bodies).<br/><br/>Oh, and it's 3D this time. My only gripe. The 3D was even more pointless than every other 3D film that's designed purely to make you spend more money.<br/><br/>From reading other reviews the general consensus is 'more of the same.' And I can't add to that. It is. There's not a lot new here and some have criticised it for not adding to the overall story enough, but, what the hell, it's still fun and Kate Beckinsale is still gorgeous. They could make a film about vampires in spandex sitting there blowing their noses for ninety minutes and I'd watch it if Kate was in it. Biased. Yes, probably.<br/><br/>Bottom line - this film may be the forth instalment of the Underworld franchise, but it's still head, shoulders and biteable neck over the Resident *yawn* Evil films."
"Jerghal","7","1","2","9 August 2013"," Wrong turn
","Although we're glad to have Kate back I have to say that they shifted very heavily to the Action genre (probably coz it was released in 3D). In the first 2 mins you get a quick recap of the other Kate-Underworld films, then a very quick exp lanation of the current story situation and then you get thrown into the action which rarely ever stops. Very little time is taken out for story, character development or background exposistion. This movie only lasts 88 mins, 10 of which are credits, so if you don't count the intro that leaves you about 75 mins of actual film of which 850 shots are VFX (which aren't bad but also not exceptional). It's nice entertainment and if you've seen the other Underworld films you'll probably also see this one but I'm not fond of the direction they've taken..."
"p-stepien","5","1","2","2 July 2013"," Slashing the scheme
","After a bout of time-travel into the early days of Vampire-Lycan eternal war, we return to the slick black leather-clad present day of Selene (Kate Beckinsale), fanged Death Dealer, who happened to fall for half-vampire, half-werewolf Michael. Modernity, however, doesn't suit peace, as human kind discover the existence of both dark alley races, thus swiftly embarking on a genocidal judgement day. With Lycans all but extinct, the few remaining vampire covens retreat into darkness. Selene and Michael are among the few captured and tested upon in a private laboratory, where they spend most of twelve years. This ends when Selene is mysteriously unthawed from her cryosleep by an unknown force and soon escapes the laboratory, only to find herself in a brave new world...<br/><br/>The idea is pretty easily defined: transform Selene into a Resident Evil-type franchise, where the luscious gut-whipping heroine defines the series, with the base premise a welcome, but secondary pretext for gore, action and prolonged adoration for the main protagonist. Kate Beckinsale fits the mold pretty well, dominating with her ruthless twirling blood-letting personality. However, where Resident Evil seems to keep the story flowing, slowly extrapolating zombie Armageddon, Underworld seems afraid to limit itself to the underground war between vampire covens and werewolf packs, instead constantly changing the back-story. After a well-rounded initial premise, confidently wielded by the slim shoulders of Beckinsale, scriptwriters decided first on a cross-European wild goose chase, than transporting us to the beginnings for whatever pointless (if satisfiable) purpose. Lost in a way to further the concept story gods Len Wiseman and co decide to do a total makeover, disposing of the set storyline and bringing in a post-genocidal world, where poor vampires and werewolves are victimised by the nasty humans (yes, the question WTH? comes immediately to mind).<br/><br/>Barring how stupefying the storyline is, ""Underworld: Awakening"" does surprisingly manage to work quite well. At least as long as you utterly discard you acting senses (some of the performance err on the wrong side of atrocious) and limit your attention to the all-out action, ignoring the dumbfounded dialogue and connect-the-dots that make absolutely no sense. Throw in some overgrown werewolves and Beckinsale pirouetting in drastically tight clothing, somehow makes the whole affair less inept than it should be with the final battle one of the highlights of action movies of the past few years. The bulky brute Lycan that is the ultimate foe make the whole story more epic and memorable, than the intrigue deserves... I guess there is nothing that is so idiotic that a voluptuous chick massacring blood-hungry foes can't fix..."

You'd think with the amount of action in the last 3 films that they would have struggled putting this amazing film together, but there isn't a single moment in the film where it feels like its dragging.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale was back in it playing Selene which make the film 1000 times better! She is such a beautiful woman and an amazing actor, who over powers you with emotion, uses powerful facial expression and makes you feel like its so real! Every single actor in this film is legit and i didn't pick up on a piece of bad acting, obviously money has been spent on acting in the right places.<br/><br/>The film was very carefully and cleverly put together, I cannot wait for it to come out on blu-ray so i can buy it and watch it everyday!<br/><br/>The film ends, with Selene and her daughter triumphing, and Selene discovering Michaels frozen body. When she goes back to get him, the body has un frozen, and gone!<br/><br/>Her daughter then gets visual through her fathers eyes, as she does with her mothers before they meet earlier on in the film.<br/><br/>I am truly hoping this is going to lead to another film with all 3 characters (and actors) in it. <br/><br/>Highly recommend anyway who likes the underworld franchise, to view this film!!"

"kenzie581","8","2","7","12 February 2012"," A guy movie with a girl hero.
","I woke up this Sunday and made some Fruit Loops in one of my ""Hello Kitty"" bowls. I check the movie times for a matinée and I feel like a guy movie. Well a girl heroine movie that guys like because her clothes are tight fitting and she kicks a lot of ass. I think there's more violence in this one than the other 3 combined and it's about 30 minutes shorter. What I was thinking before this, is well, why guy movies? Why am I geared more toward violence than other current movie offerings like The Vow? A nice wholesome movie that's like Momento without the crazy. Nah, I don't want to see The Vow. Why should I? I'm a guy I wanna see stuff blow up while the hero is holding next months' Maxim model one handed from a helicopter. Not really, I tend to enjoy movies with strong female heroines and I had a thing for Vampires in high school. So guy movies, John Hill at movieoutline.com (http://www.movieoutline.com/articles/hero_screenwriting.html) says males tend to like guy movies because we want to relive pre-adolescent fantasies. Is this true? Do I really want to go through puberty again? I don't think so but I did want to go everywhere when I was a ""pre- adolescent"" like Hawaii. So, I'll go with his explanation but Vampires? What would make me want to watch a movie about Vampires? Vampires seem to be in control of things, I read recently that people tend to want more vampire and undead lore during times of need like a recession or depression. Robin Redmond Wright, wrote that zombies are an identity for excess buying. The zombies eventually overtake the living and feed off them out of need. Vampires from her perspective, represent the rich and are in control of their life, forever. Which, along with other fantasies is pretty good in a bad economy or recession. (source for Robin's Paper: http://www.adulterc.org/proceedings/2011/papers/wright.pdf) So, that's the tangent that I took from this film. The why's for the need for Vampires in every culture and society I will not know but this franchise is pretty good in that it offers a little bit of everything. There's love, Kate Beckinsale falls for this half vampire/half werewolf man. Which is very bad among the elders of her coven. They really call it a coven in the movie which I thought was just for witches. She's also a bad ass that has automatic handguns that can hit werewolves in the head from across the room. In real life would be nearly impossible. I like her guns and this movie had a lot of action sequences. It was almost like reading a comic book with as much action that was included. I watched it in 3D also because I haven't really saw a good 3D action movie yet. This was close, I like that the filming of the action either put the character in a ""pop-up book"" fashion moving about the screen but made everything else in the frame fuzzy. If film makers could made keep the character in the background and make everything else pop-up it may make for a better movie. Since the movie is filmed in like a side view adding depth to the background would make you feel like you were right next to the character immersed in the environment rather than watching a 3D pop-up book. Anyways, just my two cents.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about this portion of the story..it was kind of short. If it's a movie I like I usually go to an early show to get rid of the teenagers that well, want to be teenagers and be loud. Not today though, it was old people that wanted to know the ""who"" or ""why"" of everything. Action movies kind of play out like a techno song. They have a longer than normal intro then a bunch of noise, then a drop in the action for dramatic effect. Then, well repeat until end credits. So, all the while as soon as it got quiet enough to hear shift my boys in my pants. The old man behind me starts up with, ""So who's that guy?"" WTF! Why? Why do you want to know old man? The story was pretty good, she comes out of a coma after 12 years to an attempted extinction of both Vampires and Werewolves, and an unknown daughter. Then, it's basically non-stop conflict for 90 minutes. I feel like I got what I paid for, an escapism to a world of guns and gore."

","Well, where do i start - I think I'll begin by stating this is the best Underworld movie in the entire series. A bold statement, but one i think a lot of people will agree with.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes is non stop action but goes at a pace that isn't difficult to keep up with. There's some great 3D scenes involving Selene and the Police. By the time it slows down the adrenaline is pumping and you find yourself with a smile on your face awaiting for whats coming next.<br/><br/>I thought the entire movie went at an excellent pace, slowing down when needed to establish the plot - it stays true to the previous 2 films obviously not including the prequel, yet becomes its own movie not recycling stories from the others. All the actors are well cast and I was kept guessing throughout the movie at what direction they would go in being surprised a number of times.<br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale was fantastic in this, she has a way of coming across as a realistic heroine without the over the top Girl Power that we see in other movies.<br/><br/>I walked out of the IMAX cinema fully pleased and thrilled with the film that has now been added to the excellent Underworld series.

Basically it picks up from where the second film left off, twelve years later, where the human race are aware of the threat and war between the races of the vampires and the werewolf Lycans, and they are trying to eradicate both, and vampire Selene (Kate Beckinsale) is trying to escape the resistance, alongside rare vampire-werewolf hybrid creature Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). It is after escaping a cryogenic chamber in a laboratory to find a cure for the vampire and werewolf curses and attacks that she meets vampire David (Theo James), and she discovers that they may two of the last remaining of their kind of Earth after the years of eradication, and they were the subjects of Dr. Jacob Lane (The Crying Game's Stephen Rea). Selene discovers that she shares the visions of Michael, and believes at some point she may be able to track him, but she also finds out she has a twelve year old daughter, Eve (India Eisley), who also came from the laboratory, and it is up to her mother and David to protect the girl against the Lycans. I will be honest and say that I didn't pay the fullest attention to everything going on, I did understand it just about, but that just shows how little I was probably interested in the first place. Also starring Charles Dance as Thomas, Michael Ealy as Detective Sebastian and Sandrine Holt as Lida. Just like the previous films the cast of a fair few well known stars was fine, although it could have done with Michael Sheen or Bill Nighy, the special effects are certainly improved and slightly more impressive, and the action sequences are just about exciting enough, but I can't get over the fact that it feels just like the other previous films, and that is not a good thing, a not very good horror. Adequate!"

","Salene kills it once again!! I quite liked this 4th entry into the Underworld franchise, having been a huge fan of the previous three, i didn't think this one was going too hit the mark, but it was done quite well carrying over from Evolution, it also creates a continuing story for future installments! Another great War with humans involved for number five please! I really loved the car chase scene with the Lycans riding on the cars!! So Good!! These are by far the best vampires/werewolves movies around! And I would recommend seeing the first three movies to get more of the history, Bill Nighy as Viktor a vampire elder is a must see."

Yes it has changed direction which is why most viewers/fans have been shocked and disappointed, and the ending is surely the beginning of the next ''Underworld'' which i found superb..Lets face it after 3 ''Underworlds''why not add new direction, i found the action mind blowing and Kate Beckinsale HOT as usual and it still had the feel of the others so i suggest sit back and enjoy.."

","I was skeptical at first. The critics reviews were low; the patron, the movie-goer, high. I'm no critic by trade so I went. Ninety minutes later, I was a fan-boy. Excellent film. The movie was crammed and brimmed with action. I was entertained from beginning to end. Kate Beckingsale played a great part as Selene. Sleek and intense, she wore her catsuit well. Besides, what else would a death-dealing , automatic gun-toting vampire wear? The action scenes between the Vampires and the Lychans were brilliant-- and brutal. Selene's daughter Eve, added to the Gothic carnage. From her striking metamorphosis to violent rages, she add nicely to the story line. Some critics mentioned the weak plot and story. I disagree. The plot was fine--and it's Vampires versus Lychans, how deep of a story do you want? Go see The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo if you want a spiderweb of a story.<br/><br/>I'm reordering my Netflix queue to include the previous movies in the series. With no football this weekend I can get nestled and watch more Kate...I mean Selene. Whatever. Just wear the catsuit."

","Some say the story isn't good, but it's good enough. The problem is the action. It's over produced, over posed, with too much CGI.<br/><br/>If you look at a list of standard superhero moves - the fall to the crouched three point stance, the head tilt, the jump spin - they're all used frequently. The fights don't flow, because they're flurries of action leading to cool poses.<br/><br/>There's too much slo mo, especially the ""now the cool hero is angry, and she's about to do something really cool"" kind of slo mo walking, often with the generic dark coat tails flipping behind her.<br/><br/>Then there's the girl. She's supposed to be 12, she looks 17, and she's more powerful than she can ever know. Good grief. We've seen this before in Firefly, for exaaaaaaaaaaaahmple. I write it as exaaaaaaaaaaahhhhmple because most of the people speak with a Euro accent.<br/><br/>Bottom line - it tries really hard to look like the Matrix, but it's more like the forgettable 3rd Matrix movie - a parody of itself."
"ThomasDrufke","5","1","3","18 January 2017"," Doubles Down
","Upping the scale doesn't always mean a better film. 'Awakening' finds Underworld at its bloodiest and perhaps most action packed, but there's once again little under the surface of a vampire-action flick.<br/><br/>At this point in the franchise, you pretty much know what you're going to get. Selene leads the war against anyone who opposes their kind. This time, however, it's humans who are on the opposite end of the stick. This premise felt a lot like when the old Planet of the Apes franchise ran out of ideas so they made a time jump and brought the humans in as the antagonists. In fact, it touches on a lot of the same social issues that 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes' did, experimentation on creatures for one. The problem is, it's only touched upon. Just like the new relationship Selene has with a young girl named Eve isn't totally the focus either.<br/><br/>I mean, I guess we can give 'Awakening' a little credit for not continuing the bland romance between Michael & Selene, and giving her someone new to care about. But there's a way to write characters into the story without overwhelming each scene with blood and guts. Heck, it's also pretty hard to root for Selene considering she slaughters every human in sight. This film absolutely doubles down on the series' heavy genre aspects, instead of trying to usher in a broader audience.<br/><br/>Theo James & Charles Dance are brought in to essentially replace roles taken by Bill Nighy and Scott Speedman. Both actors give more grounded turns than the others did, but even they can't turn awful dialogue into something worth caring about. I'm not so sure Daniel Day-Lewis could even do it. Although the dialogue is still horrendous, the characters are still shallow, and the plot continues to get more ridiculously contrived, these films can be entertaining. The action is better choreographed than any of the other films and at least the run-time is short, right?<br/><br/>+Action is amped up<br/><br/>+Performances are more grounded<br/><br/>-More blood & guts doesn't always mean the quality rises<br/><br/>-Characters are still hollow<br/><br/>5.3/10"

","Following on from 'Evolution' we see both the lycan and vampire species under threat from humans after being hunted down to the brink of extinction.<br/><br/>You know what to expect here and boy do you get it in spades, slow motion high flying kills, double gun totting shooting, swishing blades, spurting blood and endless dumbass man fodder to thicken the brew. In short its exactly like the newer 'Resident Evil' films and you half expect Jovovich to pop up and take over. The super lycan serum which results in an uber lycan is pretty much the pinnacle of crapola in this franchise now, a total 'Resi Evil' idea type rip-off and it lowers the overall class of the whole series. <br/><br/>The plot isn't tooo bad, they manage to carry it on quite well and do a good job with keeping Corvin around despite Speedman not being involved, but the rest of the cast is pretty awful really. Charles Dance seems to be there only to provide a new Viktor type character and he clearly has difficulty speaking with his fangs in, he even tries some of Nighy's head movements. The rest of the supporting cast all come across as B-movie fare frankly, even previous vampire actor Rea can't help the cause.<br/><br/>The whole film feels very basic really. Some terrible CGI effects (worse than the previous films), bad greenscreen scenes, the lycans look like shaven rats, transformations are pretty dreadful looking, the 'vision' perspective looks crap and the young Eve looks like something outta 'Mortal Kombat'. Everything basically looks plastic and fake.<br/><br/>End of the day it does what it says on the tin and we all know what this film is about so I can't moan too much, but I just get the feeling they should of left it alone. They really have gone way way over the top with all the slow motion action sequences. The fact that Selene can kill endless lycans yet no one else can, just destroys your suspension of disbelief...even in this universe. Yes its an over the top fantasy flick but there is still a limit for any Mary Sue type characters, or there should be.<br/><br/>The thing is I can see this franchise really being completely milked into the depths of the 'straight to DVD' abyss. A shame as it is/was a half decent concept with some solid ideas and reasonable early entries. Alas this kind of W.S. Anderson-esque film making is becoming infuriating in a highly tacky way.<br/><br/>4/10"

It's a shame, because Selene is a terrific anti-hero and Kate Beckinsale gives her justice. It starts off interestingly enough, but isn't able to keep up the excitement throughout. It's also a bit hollow as well. I saw this over a year ago and don't remember much about it. Underworld fans will most likely love it, but I thought it was OK at best<br/><br/>5.3/10"
"paul_haakonsen","7","1","3","20 January 2013"," The ""Underworld"" rises again...
","""Underworld: Awakening"" was somewhat of a mixed experience. The story was good, and the movie was a good addition to the franchise, after having seen the one without Beckinsale in it. However, there was just something fundamental missing from the movie to make it truly unique.<br/><br/>The story was enjoyable, but without the proper actor to play Michael it was just not the same. In this movie vampires and lycans are being hunted down to near extinction by a joint effort by the humans. Michael have left Selene with a surprise, but things are not all as they appear.<br/><br/>The action scenes and sequences in the movie, were as in the prior ""Underworld"" movies, nicely executed and visually great. And the acting in the movie was just as in the prior movies as well, so you know what you are getting into here when you sit down to watch ""Underworld: Awakening"".<br/><br/>What I found impressive in the movie, was the gargantuan lycan. That was the highlight of the movie, and that was just so well thought up on the drawing board.<br/><br/>If you enjoyed the previous ""Underworld"" movies, then you definitely have to watch this one as well. The ""Underworld"" movies do both the vampire and werewolf genre great justice, especially as they are not spiced up with teenage heartthrob, big hair and sparkly skin."
"cat_ranchero","5","1","3","5 January 2013"," Great!... (for fans of the franchise)...
","The effects, the fight scenes and the stunt-work is all of a very high quality and I can't fault the filmmakers for that. All the performances are very good, although the audience is left in no doubt who the star of the show is. I did find it hard to connect with any of the main characters though; I guess as what a vampire would consider food; I found it hard to have much sympathy with them being wiped out. Eventually though I did become enwrapped and found myself rooting for the 'good guys' towards the end. Even so, I can't say it's a particularly good film; much relies on the audience being familiar with the world in which the franchise exists and so I guess, unless you're a fan it won't make an awful lot of sense (spectacular CGI and fight scenes apart).<br/><br/>SteelMonster's verdict: NOT RECOMMENDED<br/><br/>My score: 4.8/10.<br/><br/>You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster."

","I was excited to see Underworld: Awakening. The whole concept intrigues me, the previous movies were interesting and fun to watch. Also, I like Kate Beckinsale as an actress, she can take on being an action female character with such grace. I am sadden to say that I was no impressed of this fourth installment of the franchise. The story does not flow well, the parties involved does not seem to fit. As mentioned in the trailer, the humans started rounding up the vampires and lycans, Selene wakes up 12 years later to find that the world has changed. Then she escaped, finds a hybrid child, mentions a gigantic lycan, and left the rest for the viewer to find out in the movie. I will say that the trailer was more exciting than the movie itself. <br/><br/>Character development was non-existent. Aside for Selene, all the other characters are new. Their deeper involvement seems to be space fillers. Like most movies, this one left an option for an addition to the franchise. At this time, I cannot imagine how it can move along. Maybe this is it, at least it was done in a way that I will not miss it.<br/><br/>There was a good amount of action, but not exciting. It seems forced into the movie and filmed just for the sake of having action scenes in the movie. They quickly became boring and felt too long. Then there were the plot holes! My recommendation, don't watch it if you're not familiar with the franchise. However, if you are a fan of it, give it a shot and see for yourself, for fans, I think we owe it to ourselves to see what happens."

"ford_guy20042000","5","1","3","30 May 2012"," This was an Underworld movie?
","Right away the only reason why this movie is getting a 5 out of me is because of Kate Beckinsale. The woman is a stunning little creature and you add leather...whew. While she is hot, the movie is not.<br/><br/>The feel that I got from it was that it was like a Resident Evil movie...those awful movies that rely on a hot girl and good special effects, no story or substance. How can it have any substance when they churn them out so fast...but I am not rating Resident Evil.<br/><br/>It was short...too short for Selene's return to the franchise. She deserved better than what she got. It felt like a to be continued season finale on television. The only problem with that is...with those to be continued season finales, they are usually cliffhangers. It felt like a small hill.<br/><br/>The movie featured an entirely new cast besides Kate Beckinsale with nothing to introduce or give any background information on any of the characters. They alluded to plot lines in former movies, but unless you have seen the past movies recently you probably don't remember them. At least I didn't...there was a time or two where I was looking up the Underworld wiki to see what the heck was going on.<br/><br/>The action was good, Kate kicks butt in leather...ooh (Shiver down my spine). I thought the CG was OK in places and then very weak in others. Some of it was so poorly done I thought it could have been made as good 20 years ago. Honestly, I want to see something new. The effects weren't there, nor was the plot or acting. It seemed like the most dialog came from a third tier character. Of course they were ALL third tier characters except for Selene.<br/><br/>I am sure they will make another one...but I hope they have an awakening after Awakening and put a little more effort into it."

","'UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>This fourth film in the successful action/horror series finds Kate Beckinsale returning to her most popular role (after sitting the last film, a prequel, out). This installment was directed by Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein and written by John Hlavin, J. Michael Straczynski, Alison Burnett and Len Wiseman (who also produced). Wiseman has co-written all of the 'UNDERWORLD' films, as well as directed the first two, and is married to Beckinsale. This chapter has Beckinsale's character (Selene) pitted against evil humans determined to exterminate all vampires and lycan alike. It's not as good as the previous three films but it's about as good as you can expect coming from a fourth chapter in a vampires vs. werewolves series.<br/><br/>The film takes place 12 years after the second movie, 'UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION' (which took place third chronologically), when Selene awakens in a laboratory where she has been experimented on for a dozen years by scientists. She also learns that humans have discovered the existence of vampires and lycan. Both species have also nearly been exterminated by the evil human race, who also plot to create a more advanced and super-powerful lycan being. Selene must team with a human detective (Michael Ealy) in order to stop them.<br/><br/>The movie is stylishly directed and action packed. It's almost too fast paced though as the relentless action scenes get a little exhausting. Beckinsale looks beautiful (as always) though and so does the movie (especially in 3D). It's just that it used to be a more involving and intelligent film series and now it seems to closer resemble the 'RESIDENT EVIL' franchise.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fii0IC2l7o"

I missed Scott Speedman not being in the film, but Michael Corvinus did make an appearance. Confused yet? Well they had to use a little trickery to do it. I was worried this film would dismiss too much of what had happened before but it did not. I watched the film in 3D and it had a few seconds here and there of some particles and figures flashing at you but mostly it was the same feel as all 3D movies where it is more visual gimmicks than real substance. You definitely will not miss much if you watch it in 2D, and save some money while doing it. The movie itself is good and they tried some new things and continued to add to the Underworld legacy. They definitely left an ending where they have more story for another if it is successful enough and the powers that be want to do another one. very good entertainment if you like action, gory violence and vamps/wolves!"

","I'm not a big fan of the Underworld movie franchise but I enjoyed the first two installments and after the prequel setting of the below-average third movie, I was interested what would become of the Selene and Michael story. Turned out I haven't missed much.<br/><br/>This movie starts with a brief re-cap of what happened in the first two movies. After that it is explained that the vampires and lycans are discovered by the rest of mankind, who want to wipe both species out. Selene fights hard against the humans, searching for Michael which she finds in the harbor. Unfortunately, a grenade hits the both of them just after they find each other and all goes black for Selene. She wakes up a long time later from cryogenic sleep in a laboratory, having no idea what has happened to Michael or the other vampires. Selene now has to find out where the remaining vampires are, if the lycans are still a threat and how she mysteriously woke up from her sleep.. <br/><br/>While the story is 'okay-ish', this is a very weak and sometimes laughably bad movie. Okay, I know these movies are not supposed to be taken to seriously but the characters are so weak, the CGI so horrible and the action so over the top that it's just bad. The only character with more then two lines of background is Selene and only if you watched the previous installments. Nothing new is added to her character, no development at all. And I'm supposed to believe that she cannot be damaged at all? She gets elevators dropped on top of her, cars thrown against her but nothing can hurt her, or her outfit. She also can bring people back from the dead by sticking her hand inside them and grabbing their heart..? WTF? <br/><br/>The other characters are just there to be killed off or given a few lines to help the plot along. You are supposed to care about some characters but because they are just cardboard cutouts, you just laugh at the horrible bad effects when they get killed or kill lycans. There is a car chase scene with lycans pursuing the heroes but it looked so bad that I was just laughing. I have seen video game cut scenes from the 90's with better effects. <br/><br/>So yeah, unless your a big fan of the franchise best leave this movie in the garbage bin. Stick to the first two movies and write your own ending for the franchise, it will be better then this pile of manure."

","The previous UNDERWORLD movie (RISE OF THE LYCANS) was a prequel film which substituted lead star Kate Beckinsale for her low-budget lookalike Rhona Mitra, but it's business as usual for this, the fourth in the series and a 'proper' sequel to the second film, UNDERWORLD: EVOLUTION. It's set sometime in the future, where a thawed-out Beckinsale finds herself in the midst of a new war between vampires, humans and werewolves.<br/><br/>UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING dispenses with any kind of plausible storyline from the outset, instead focusing on non-stop and relentless action at all times. It's a film that's filled to the brim with gory incident and violent death, as Beckinsale and her cronies go up against an army of bloodthirsty werewolves, led by a huge mutant creature in some of the most fun monster movie set-pieces I've seen in a good while. Yes, the entire film is completely dominated by CGI, but it does work for the most part.<br/><br/>This isn't a 'good' film in the accepted sense of the word, of course. Beckinsale seems to get lazier and lazier as each movie goes by, and the supporting cast aren't much better. The only recognisable actors in the cast are an aged and tired Stephen Rea and the inimitable Charles Dance, who shows up, acts everyone else's socks off, and then disappears again. Never mind: UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING is fun, noisy, fast-paced and extraordinarily gruesome. It delivers what it sets out to deliver, and you can't ask for much more than that."

","I don't understand why this movie is kept on getting good reviews. I agree little bit that it had some action flips in it but it didn't drive me crazy at all. I think it was the same old mess with just few additions to it. It was not very refreshing to watch and the story was lacking in character improvement and I was just feeling for another follow-up.<br/><br/>The movie was also too short. It made this ""Underworld: Awakening"" a more like a TV episode than a major picture. I can't believe that $70million was spent on this movie. I think the story was the most awful part because in this 1.5 hours film, only 20-30 minutes is spent actually on the conversation. It is tough to describe this movie's shortcoming without destroying it. They really unnoticed some elements that could make this movie better rather than plain. The movie was way too short which confirms its lack of substance.<br/><br/>At first, I couldn't realize why I did not like this movie, as the overall was quite OK. But even at its Evolution, the Underworld sequence constantly maintained some strength to the world which the characters occupy. It just looked like that the director had just finished the whole movies in a month or two and why they spent $70 mil with such a low special effects. Even Underworld 3 had a budget of $35 mil. One thing which fascinated me was the leather jackets used in this movie which was outstanding and played a vital role. desert leather manufactures genuine leather jackets as worn by the famous personalities.<br/><br/>One more scene which brain teased me is when Selene found Michael. He was not reacting when the cop called her and asked for helping his daughter. Selene did not deceived her lover due to the parental duty. The only cause I am scoring this movie with 4/10 is because of the beautiful and fascinating Kate Beckinsale. There were major gaps in the story, so if you were thinking to watch a good story, this is not your piece of cake!!"

","Was moved to write this review after disagreeing with another users opinions about the movie. I was quite satisfied with the movie and the overall direction after Evolution.<br/><br/>I was wondering how Awakening would continue what seemed to be a completed story, the new arc opens quite a few plot lines to continue the series. My one biggest qualm with the movie would be the interactions between Eve and Selene. It would have made for more fruitful character development if Selene would have been more emotional with Eve and there was more dialogue between the two characters. Especially through the midway portion of the film where we are led to believe Eve is Selene's only link to Michael.<br/><br/>The acting was perfectly acceptable, nothing stood out as being great or poor. The script was crafted in such a way that wasn't conducive for an actor to stand out with an amazing performance or give one. Sandrine Holt (Lida) was able to show skill with her scenes conveying general care and concern for Eve. Her character was constructed to be more motherly than Selene, which is slightly understandable as Lida watched over Eve for twelve years.<br/><br/>Overall I say this is my favorite overall film in the series, although I felt the Rise of the Lycans script involved a slightly more gripping and complete storyline with more attention to intricate details."

","Having enjoyed the previous iterations of the Underworld franchise, I was anxiously awaiting this most recent installment. The quality of the cast is strong, the writing is generally substantive, and the story is a compelling one. Where the film failed for me fell right in the lap of the director and the cinematographers. The incessant flashing white lights throughout the movie are a cheap, sloppy vehicle to attempt to create an atmosphere of impending danger and suspense.<br/><br/>Why is it that in a high security facility like Antigen, when a disturbance occurs on one floor of the building, the fluorescent lights all begin to flash on and off everywhere in the building? The use of the flashing lights was so overdone that it ruined the rest of the film for me. I made a concerted effort to block out the flashes, particularly in scenes where there was no plausible reason why the lights would be flashing, but to no avail.<br/><br/>This directorial combo will be one to avoid in future films. Lazy and uninspired; they blew an opportunity to make an exceptional film."
"FrankieGoesHwood","4","1","4","9 July 2012"," Worst of the series
","I recently got into the Underworld franchise in the last year or so and have watched the three movies prior right around when Awakening was being advertised. I was excited to see the series continue, even though the third installment was my least favorite (killing off all the old elders didn't sit well with me).<br/><br/>Anyway, number 4 was not very good at all. The story line had potential as I would have like to see more conflict between humans and the ""cleansing"" war against Lycons and the Vampires. There were opportunities to expand on the storyline but the movie felt like it was edited down dramatically (its only 90 min). For example, it would have been great to see Selene redeem herself to the new Vampire elder and win their trust. If there was about another 30 to 45 min with meaty story lines, then it could have excelled. I'm sure they will do a 5th installment which could kill the franchise if its not any better than Awakening."
"TxMike","Null","1","4","22 May 2012"," Fun to watch India Eisley develop as an actress.
","There is a TV show, ""The Secret Life of the American Teenager"" running for 4 years now and India Eisley plays the little sister of the main character Amy. I don't watch it anymore but from the first episode she was in I couldn't take my eyes off her any time she was in the scene. She has a natural acting style and a particular look that captures the camera and doesn't let it go. So it was nice to see her here, in something totally different, as the lab-created daughter of Selene. And she even uses a type of British accent.<br/><br/>As I watched the movie I found myself wondering if many fans actually watch it for the story, or for the characters and the action. There is lots of action, and much of it is the bloody, gory type. Kate Beckinsale of course is back as Selene. There is some sort of ongoing battle between the Vampires and the Lycans who change into these beasts that look to be the size of a large great ape. Selene has her hands full fighting them.<br/><br/>In this story Selene and Michael are wounded, jump in the water, and a type of explosive device is set off. Next thing we know she is encased in a frozen state in the lab of Stephen Rea as Dr. Jacob Lane of Antigen Corporation. When she breaks out she thinks a day has passed but it in fact was 12 years. She finds out during that time she has been given a daughter and much of the rest of the movie has her fighting to retrieve her daughter that has been captured and brought to a hidden location.<br/><br/>That daughter is India Eisley as Eve . She doesn't have a large part, but an important one, and her short time on-screen is very effective. I look for her to break out into bigger roles, as she is still a teenager.<br/><br/>I can take or leave this sort of movie, although Beckinsale is terrific as Selene. I did particularly enjoy one scene near the end when she is fighting the strongest and baddest of the Lycans, we see her reach into his abdomen then withdraw her hand. He says ""You know I will heal right away."" She responds, ""I am counting on it"", then we see she is holding the pin from a grenade which now is sealed inside him. As she ducks around a corner there is a big explosion and bits of flesh flying through the air.<br/><br/>Camp."

","I have been keenly waiting for this installment after watching last three movies of this series and therefore i am a bit disappointed. First of all the length of the movie 88 minutes is like this is gonna be a TV series. The making was good and actions scenes were superb as usual. Kate Beckinsale was awesome in her comeback movie (after 3rd installment). There is a huge jump of the story and plot of this movie. Its now starting to incorporate the present days time line instead of showing Vampires and Lycans troublesome survival for centuries after centuries. <br/><br/>The present day story line reminds me off another legendary movie story Resident Evil. Somehow the two stories are similar in some points which is another reason of disappointment.<br/><br/>Overall, i think this installment is an average release!!!"

","I love the Underworld series. I saw Awakening yesterday and even though I knew the plot and spoilers, etc. I still loved it. Definite action and Selene is definitely more aggressive and angry in this one than previous ones. I do believe a little more time could have been spent on some character interaction development, such as that between Selene and her daughter (who we all know her name is Eve but I don't remember ever hearing it in the movie, I believe she was just referred to at 'girl', 'it', and 'specimen 2')as well as a little more time with Selene realizing she has a daughter and how that might impact the overall situation. I thought that part could have been a little more developed (but I am a female, after all and we do enjoy our relationships). The action was wonderful and nonstop. I left the theater feeling like Awakening was similar to Empire Strikes Back...it wasn't really a finished ending to a story- just a stepping stone to a solid ending for the story - which I really hope they do (longer than 88 minutes and with Scott Speedman for Michael)."
"Troy_Campbell","6","1","4","26 January 2012"," A return to form for the Underworld series.
","Are you an avid follower of the Underworld movies? If not, stop reading now. You'll get less satisfaction out of Awakening than what your Grandma gets out of listening to heavy metal. Ironically, this sequel is similar to heavy metal music in almost every way: extremely loud and often incoherent, yet highly enjoyable to those in-built fans. There's very little here that reinvents the Gothic franchise – it again revolves around the battling between vampires and lycans (werewolves in all but name) – but it manages to deliver the stylishly violent thrills that made the original film such a hit and was so noticeably lacking in the previous duo of abysmal instalments. Kate Beckinsale is back too, and besides looking incredibly wonderful in the skin-tight black leather outfit that has become a bit of a trademark of the series, she also brings some much needed acting clout to the screen. A return to form that will have Underworld devotees excited."
"HeliosZg","8","1","4","21 January 2012"," While it lacks the detailed storytelling and somewhat the atmosphere of the previous entries, Underworld: Awakening is still a pretty watchable action flick.
","I'm sure everyone knows by now who Selene is... the sexy vampiress in her trademark tight lycra outfit is back! And she's deadlier than ever! At some points I was even surprised how ruthless she has become, this film definitely packing more blood and gore than the previous entries. But Selene does it with style, the action sequences being more beautiful, fluid and spectacular than ever before. The special effects have definitely evolved, loved the little particle effects present in some parts of the movie, you'll see... <br/><br/>Kate Beckinsale pretty much is Underworld at this point because all the other trademark characters are dead or the actors have refused to appear in this one. She does a nice job but there weren't really many acting challenges in this one for her to begin with, she definitely had a harder time shooting all the beautiful stunts. Michael Ealy, Theo James (the sexiest male vampire in Undeworld for sure!^^) and India Eisley are a nice addition, though. Scott Speedman isn't in this one so the Michael parts were in my opinion the trashiest parts of the movie, you'll understand what I meant by this once you see the movie. But I blame Scott for that, he should've returned. If they ever make a fifth movie, Scott Speedman should either return or they should kill his character off and put Selene and David together^^. Although the main villains are supposed to be humans, the old vampires vs lycans war never gets old and it reverts back to just that in the end :D. Speaking of villains, there's no villain like Marcus in this one, only monsters that have to be killed off by Selene with style^^.<br/><br/>What I disliked about this one was the fact that they've changed the atmosphere of the Underworld universe. No Gothic buildings, no vast backstories of the two clans, it just doesn't suck you into the world like the other movies did. With that said, this has definitely improved the pacing in this entry. There are no parts that drag and the story and action are simultaneous so you never get bored. Plus the fact that the movie is under 90 minutes also contributes to this... <br/><br/>All in all, I'm glad I watched this movie and I think you should, too. They've given Underworld a new start so there's room for more movies, too. We'll see... While the first two movies are still my favorites and I miss the old Underworld atmosphere, I liked this one because I've really missed Selene so I give it 8/10 (although it probably deserves 7/10)."

"leonblackwood","2","1","5","14 September 2013"," Ridiculous! 2/10
","Review: I've never really been a big fan of the Underworld franchise, and this movie doesn't really help. All of the bloody movies seem the same, no matter what the storyline is. Basically they always have the main character going around kicking ass, but in this one she is trying to rescue her daughter. All of the fancy shooting in slow motion seemed a bit necessary and in some parts, a bit ridiculous. It just amazes me that 1 woman can go around killing everything in site in latex, with getting her hair and make-up out of place. Uninteresting!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I suppose that they will be making more of these movies because they always make money. God know why! I thought that the aliens/beasts looked stupid and the whole black/blue look of the movie wasn't done that well. I think that you can tell that I won't be rushing to see part 5,6,7..... I might look good in 3D though. Anyway, one of the good things is that the movie is short and there is non stop action for those people who like mindless fighting, shooting and blood and gore.<br/><br/>Budget: $70million Worldwide Gross: $160million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the Underworld franchise and who are into there vampire action. 2/10"

","Date: 11 May <br/><br/>-First Time Watch- <br/><br/>After seeing the first Underworld movie a few months ago, I was somewhat looking forward to seeing the latest movie added to the series. I was somewhat disappointed. While the film definitely did not disappoint as far as violence goes it did lack a storyline. It was way to short and the newest cast member I didn't really like mostly because I didn't like how the writers intertwined the character into the story. However, I will say that I did like the addition of Michael Ealy's character, Detective Sebastian. Overall, it was just an average film.

"the-awesome-von-grimm","8","1","6","9 December 2014"," Better than the rest.
","I was doubting if I should name the title of this summary 'better than the rest'. Mostly because I have read lots of reviews about this movie and most of them say that Awakening is the worst of them all. And second, because those reviews mostly say that it doesn't feel like an Underworld movie, so I think that those people are more of a die-hard fan than I am. Don't get me wrong, I loved the previous Underworld movies. But I always thought that they lacked characters and emotions. I thought the movies were kinda black and white. So before everyone sends me death messages and hatred, please read my opinion and respect it.<br/><br/>The first movie was nice, but bald. You don't really get to know the protagonist, Selene. You only know she has a troubled past with parent issues and that's what made her a boring, monotone killing machine. This had been-there-done-that all over it, they could have done so much more. That she develops a romantic relationship with somebody she only spoke two words with is still a mystery to me. They could have build up the romance, or let something cool happen but no, just BAM! Here, let's do it and kiss and now we are lovers for life. Throughout all the movies I think it lacks character development. Not that there are a lot of characters, since all the characters Selene meets only have 5 minutes screen time or just stand in the background. Or they instantly disappear or die. In the third movie I see that this changes a little. There are more characters that actually have some depth and you, as a watcher, feel for them and really get sucked in the movie. In the first two I couldn't relate with anything and no, that's not because they are a different species and vampires and I don't understand them.<br/><br/>In this last movie you see a big difference: there are more people! People with feelings and stories and dreams and actually speak and interact! The first 20 minutes reminded me a bit of Daybreakers, just briefly, and I love that movie so it brought me right in the zone. It's a shame that so many people think the storyline is dull. I think it was a cool concept and they did enough with it to make it interesting. Selene actually says some emotional things that make you feel for her, something I didn't do in the past. I love how they show you things from the previous movies. I agree with people who say it's short. It has an open ending and I thought there was more but suddenly the credits came and I thought: ""Oh."" But it did make me wonder how it would go on and I do want to see the next movie. It still has the dark lycan VS vampire vibe, it still has bad-ass action and it still has enjoyable plot twists. And it has more characters (sorry, I really love more than one person in a movie) that you actually get to know."
"LeonLouisRicci","5","1","6","13 December 2012"," Cheats Movie Fans and Gamers
","There is no doubt that there are a lot of movies that play like video games. Some use that look sparingly for certain effect and others are nothing more than that, and here we go. This one is nothing more than like watching someone else play a video game. It can be entertaining and a cool pass time.<br/><br/>When a film delivers this thin, shallow representation of a big screen event without any other involvement, it has reached that level of movie-mediocrity that is lazy, rushed, and rather an insult to film fans and to be sure video game enthusiasts. There really are two types of entertainment here and one can enjoy both at their own level, and enjoy them quite passionately.<br/><br/>But when a big screen, big budget movie shows nothing other than a reflection of its pop-culture counterpoints chops without any more than a thread of a story to connect the action, it is sad to say, a cheat, and a rip-off.<br/><br/>There is much here that is worth watching in a gory, gargantuan kinda way with splatter and great looking kills. But story and script wise, well, there is one memorable line and that comes at the end of it all. Pretty lame writing for a highly paid Screenwriter and Director. But it is good ""work"" if you can get it, but the fact is, its not good work. Just average, at best."
"Brady-Josephs","10","1","6","17 July 2012"," Great movie-Great story (IMO)
","I have been a huge fan of the Underworld movies and have watched them a few times. These movies always have the best bad guys! Victor was good in the first but he looked better in the 3rd. They add little or big things to the main bad guy of each movie, like Victors white/pink hair on his armor and his personal entourage or elite soldiers. Then I think Marcus is so gangsta! Top 10 ever on bad guys, that character makes me want to have wings!. Then the HUGE werewolf was awesome. I tried not to watch any previews because I wanted to be surprised but had a feeling of a big werewolf but that thing is fierce! Sorry back to this movie. I've read others reviews of this movie and the negatives, which I can understand. I do agree it should have showed more of the ""purgatory"" or the finding and killing of the vampires then werewolves. That part really could have been it's own movie but I don't know if they wanna make 8 of them. Also it should have been longer. I also didn't like the ending with Michael or how she shot the cold air filled chamber to release him. When she was released, it didn't take her long to get up and going. Then he's gone in the city from the rooftop, yell his name, there's that connection they have right? Some say there is no story line, just action. But I thought it was a great story line, it's a story line that takes some thinking. I mean no disrespect to others but either they didn't think far enough into the story, didn't even get the story or maybe the story line is obvious to others and I think I'm smart while watching or thinking about the movie and liking the story. I saw one saying the humans are the common enemy, why are they still fighting each other. The werewolves are the humans, not the whole population but the rich and the government. I think of some secret society, that would include political leaders, the very very rich, etc. Still human but way stronger. They can hide this and continue to build on their army without others knowing, even others trusting them and eventually taking over. But Selene, her crazy daughter, and the slow thinker or not good actor Michael are gonna rain on their parade. I wrote this at separate times so sorry if I'm all over and I've never been a good writer, I survived college w/ copy & paste!"

So, a little ""different."" 2) I won't give it away, but there is a scene near the end that could have indicated a bigger climactic scene than what the actual finale was. So, I was a little disappointed that it didn't happen, but, the finale itself was still pretty good. 3) There were a few scenes of photographs showing Celine in action, and to be honest, the photographs looked very cheaply made.

"rooprect","Null","0","1","17 May 2019"," Imagine if Steven Segal wrote an Underworld movie
","Not meant as a diss to either this movie or to Steven Segal, but my title sums it up. Like a Steven Segal flick such as, um, you know the one where something bad happens and then Steven kills all the bad people, ""Underworld Awakening"" is cut from the same mold. That is: high on action, low on story. This might work depending on what mood, or level of inebriation, you're in. However, it's a noticeable departure from the prior 3 Underworld films.<br/><br/>In each of the prior films, sure there was a ton of action & flashy pyrotechnics, but they were carried by a pretty clever story usually featuring a big ""aha gotcha"" reveal at the end. What made them so interesting was seeing how Selene reacts to the gotcha, dealing with intense conflicts of loyalty and faith in her purpose.<br/><br/>""Underworld Awakening"" doesn't really have any big character revelation like that. It's a linear story that's mostly predictable (in a good way). The strength of this film lies in the cool action scenes and, of course, the tense atmosphere that's pervasive in all the films.<br/><br/>When I say ""cool action scenes"" I'm referring to some interesting shots that go by so quickly that if you blink you might miss them, but if you catch them you're left thinking ""woah. cool.""<br/><br/>I'll give you just one example. There's a scene where a bad guy gets dropped from a high building, then the camera switches to a stationary shot at ground level where (you guessed it) SPLUK the bad guy smashes into a roof of a car, which is pretty cool in itself, but simultaneously Selene descends at the same moment like a badass, landing on the ground and walking away. woah. cool.<br/><br/>The entire film has some subtle yet clever shots like that--interesting camera angles (like Selene's opening, rotating scene)--which serve as excellent eye candy with a touch of artistry.<br/><br/>So really I'm not complaining, except that after the heart pounding spectacle is over, you realize that there wasn't really much of a clever story like the old ones. Still a fun ride which I recommend to all Underworld fans (and yes, you should see at least 1 & 2 before watching this, otherwise you may get very confused)."
"Osmiumos","6","0","1","26 March 2017"," Elephant in the room
","The plot concept is excellent, casting of Rea and Dance is inspired. However the script seems to have evolved around Speedman's exclusion, and the workarounds to disguise his absence actually draw attention to it. Unfortunately, the CGI has become intrusive in this third installment. Having watched a ""making of"" documentary for the second installment, in which the producers and film makers detailed the lengths they went to to minimise CGI and to maintain authenticity, the reliance on CGI is disappointing. However the CGI is poorly executed and intrusive on numerous occasions to the detriment of the story. I understand the compulsion for action sequences, but these should complement and advance the story. The character of Eve is underdeveloped and her fight scenes are absurd. The imbalance is laughable, as are the efforts to appeal to a younger audience. Theo, Theo, I guess it offered plenty of screen time... but your rebellious teen dialogue... at some point you need to move on from this cliché. Having worked the story around Speedman's absence, somehow they have decided to keep him alive and the continuation of this saga now rests on his availability for the next installment. Fingers crossed."

","Honestly, if it wasn't for Kate Beckinsale (OK, Selene ...) I'd probably miss this movie. I liked the first two films of the franchise, but this one left me somehow in doubts. I didn't like that Michael was not in this movie, but I liked Kate. The movie is absolutely no masterpiece, there are some almost stupid moments in it, but as a whole, it's watchable and delivers what one might expect: an hour and a half of passable entertainment, providing you're a Underworld fan.<br/><br/>I liked the choice of actress for Eve. India looks just like Kate might have looked in her age.<br/><br/>The end, however, left me wondering ... is there going to be another movie, revealing if Selene and Eve ever found Michael or not? Judging by Kate's statements it's highly unlikely.<br/><br/>On the other hand: there are definitely rumors about new movie, but ... without Selene and Michael. I guess I won't watch such a movie. Selene is the heart and soul of Underworld and a movie without her would be just one more attempt to earn some more money from the franchise.<br/><br/>Bottomline: if you like Underworld and Selene, you won't be too disappointed. But don't expect too much!"

","I don't know who had the wet dream of having yet another attempt at an already failing series of movies. There was a whole lot of muscle, but the mind was straight down the toilet. The plot points, the acting, the sequencing, and the overall script was a disgusting mess of plot holes and underplayed blocking. How can they so badly under-use what star power they actually had? While I will admit, there were action sequences that kept my interest, but then there was the fact that they dulled down the werewolves to diseased-ridden, giant sewage rats. Then there was the little girl that they had to save. It was bad enough that she couldn't act to save her life, but it really didn't help that her cgi/makeup job for her hybrid form looked like a monkey-symbol doll painted blue. I'd like to go into more, (Micael Corvin's obvious off-set performance which he taped for another sequel, or even a huge cast of overall useless characters) but if I did, then I'd just turn this into an all-around rant. I don't want to do that. <br/><br/>So I would also like to say that if you want to watch an actual bad movie that's easy to sit through and make fun of, then this is definitely your movie. It really wasn't so terribly repulsive as to turn off in the first ten minutes, especially if you have friends over. So in that case, I recommend this movie. But if you want an awesome action/horror movie, just watch the first Underworld."

","I really liked the first 3 episodes of Underworld. It was something special and better than Twilight. Underworld is known for it's story and violence. But sadly, this one has no story! Only violence. It seems like the director wants us to focus more on the graphics rather than the content.<br/><br/>I hope that they come up with a good episode after that where it will clarify the ending of this one. Other than that, they shouldn't bother doing another one.<br/><br/>The thing about this series is that it comes once every 3 years. So make it good next time please."
"CinematicThylacine","5","0","2","4 February 2014"," A Sloppy Mess of Watered-Down Underworld and Resident Evil (SPOILERS)
","Let me first start off by saying that I found it REALLY odd that the main villains of the movie were lycans who ran a medical company, I guess the movie makers were trying to go for a Resident Evil approach (along with the opening shot of our main protagonist waking up in some biological-virus research laboratory). I just felt this was extremely contradictory to the past three films of the series, with the lycans being oppressed by the vampires. I was seriously expecting some-sort of uneasy alliance form between the remaining lycans and vampires in order to unite against the humans and their anti-vampire/lycan purges. What is even more frustrating is that they got rid of a majority of the previous characters and we are left with only a few boring ones. Almost all the mythology, back-story, and mythos is gone and we are only left with Matrix-wannabe vampires doing backflips and fighting boring fights against CGI gorillas....oops, I meant lycans."

","Not a terrible movie overall but very predictable if you've seen Ultraviolet. The kid being hers and others trying to get it. The ""doctor"" who is trying to ""eradicate"" a virus but is really infected by the virus and is bent on using it in his power play. The sidekick, in this case a cop, who helps the hero. The whole movie does not have the same attention grabbing elements as the earlier Underworld films. The dark is there however the attitude isn't. Celine looks worn rather than vengeful. The whole movie feels disjointed even when it does explain connections. Flashbacks would have helped. It's an OK film for a rainy afternoon where your kids are prattling on and assorted interruptions keep popping up because in reality you wouldn't have missed much."
"xlars","7","0","2","16 January 2014"," Interesting Religio-philosophical allegory.
","The Underworld Quadrilogy is an interesting row of films. The plot and the stories with sequels and prequels aren't all that bad, even though highly illogical. <br/><br/>The writers could, though, have scored a few pointers in studying fairy-tales somewhat closer. What really makes this series of films interesting is the religio-philosophical and allegorical idea that lies behind. <br/><br/>Now, I will not go deeper into this realm in this review, lest I open the door to a Dantean inferno that I am not willing to enter, nor let others enter into. Thus I will just leave it to others there. <br/><br/>Maybe others are willing to pilpul the matter further, and deeper - and end up with some kind of final halakha at some later date in the future. As a final conclusion to this review, I will give the complete series of films an evaluation of 7. And add that most of that seven comes from a combination of good dramatization and equally good special effects."

","It's the near future, and the human world has discover vampires & Lycans. Selene (Kate Beckinsale) and Michael gets captured and stored in frozen captivity. Then 12 years after the Cleansing, Selene is free by another test subject in the lab called Eve (India Eisley) who Selene believes is her and Michael's offspring.<br/><br/>The visual look is slightly weaker than the original. But it is a lot of action. It really doesn't stop for much of the last half of the movie. The larger Lycan CGI looks kinda fake. But I still like the action.<br/><br/>This one really misses Scott Speedman only because Michael is constantly being referenced. Selene is looking for him throughout the movie. That's why he needs to make a cameo. Maybe he'll return in future installments."

","Vampire warrioress Selene, escapes imprisonment to find herself in a world where humans have discovered the existence of both Vampire and Lycans. Soon she uncovers a secret that shakes her world and the future of the clans. <br/><br/>With a sleek stylish opening that summarises the previous films it quickly moves on to set up the new story. From the outset there feels like there's more blood, action, bullets, tight outfits and (Kate) makeup. Underworld retains its dark look - here directors Mans Marlind and Bjorn Stein gives it a look even more ominous, grounded and overall grittier feel than the other instalments, certainly than the third. However, there's less scope than the previous outings limited by the story. The Lycan design has changed due to the creatures going 'underground' some of the CGI effects miss the mark but for the most part are executed well. <br/><br/>The supporting cast are all on form right down to Eve play by the young actress India Eisley.  Kate Beckinsale as usual is mesmerising ensuring a solid backbone to the film reinforced by strong performances from (underused) Charles Dance and Stephen Rea. Wes Bentley cameos which is a short-lived shame. <br/><br/>Awaking is just that; a shake up of the franchise it feels like a filler until part 5, with high octane heavy action excitement including Über Werewolves. With the character of Michael Corvin and Speedman's 'Terminator Salvation' styled appearance a fifth instalment even though somewhat forced is still welcomed."
"KineticSeoul","6","0","7","3 April 2012"," The best in this franchise so far...Although that ain't saying much
","If you seen the past ""Underworld"" movies that won't be much of a factor for this flick. It does show flashbacks of what happened all the way through to where this movie begins. So to the audiences that haven't seen the previous movies it won't effect this movie much. With that being said, this has almost nothing to do with the previous movie, even Selene's new found gift in evolution won't have much of a factor in this. Anyways this isn't the most story driven movie in this franchise although the others didn't really have a great plot either. But it's entertaining to watch somewhat because of the constant action sequences. Which is really a good thing for this movie cause when it started to delve and go more into the story direction it easily got boring and wanted the next action scene to come. The plot is basically this, it's not a complete vampires vs. werewolves anymore, but vampires against humans and a bit of a twist. The action sequences in this is done pretty well and cool, but than again this franchise is more known for style than substance. For some reason this franchise just didn't care for going in a somewhat story driven direction or just given up on it. Cause this one sort of reminded me of the recent ""Resident Evil"" movies. But since this one had constant action that was entertaining to watch despite the lack of a good story I give this one a 6.9/10 can't really give it a solid 7. Selene is also more brutal and lacks compassion which might work, but it just seemed a bit out of character.<br/><br/>6.9/10"

","As a fan of the Underworld movies i was excited to see the last installment but i was rapidly disappointed by a few factors like: 1.Only 88 minutes? The first Underworld was 120 minutes long and even the third close to 2 hours. They really got lazy with this one.<br/><br/>2.Poor CGI. It looks like 3 and that was 3 years ago (kinda funny). Again they got lazy.<br/><br/>3.Poor story. I realize that Underworld movies are more about action than story but this is just lame. How did humans discover them? How and when was the child conceived? And when and how did she learn how to revive another vampire, and why it's not even mentioned in the first 3 movies? The last one is just a gimmick to keep a character alive.<br/><br/>4.What's the deal with the ""Chosen One""? Yes, she's super powerful but aside from that nothing! Like Michael in the first 3 movies. Not a lot of ""speciality"" in them. But they keep centering the story around them.<br/><br/>Aside from this 4 thing this movie is Underworldish. Cool fighting scenes, lots of blood, dark atmosphere and most important hot principal actress.<br/><br/>Anyway to really judge it go, see the movie and have fun."
