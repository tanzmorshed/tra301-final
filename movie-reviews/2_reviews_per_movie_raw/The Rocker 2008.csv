","This was the biggest surprise of the year - bar none.<br/><br/>A great comedy - as in laughs, feel good, and just plain enjoyable.<br/><br/>The plot of the loser who makes good at rock'n'roll second time around is very Jack Black and Rainn Wilson does a GREAT job - there is no recourse to gross or sarcastic humor here - rather it plays on its rock roots, chucks in some stupidity, and some kick-ass tunes, and lots of excellent one liners and like I say totally surprised us as to how genuinely funny and warm-hearted this is.<br/><br/>Great cast and a great script - sure it's not perfect, but after all the pseudo-comedy and angst of 2008 it was refreshing just to sit back and enjoy an entertaining movie.<br/><br/>we loved it and are normally really cynical about comedies - but this rocks and would recommend to anyone as a real effort by all involved to stop being smarter than the audience and just enjoy life - in two and a half words? - it rocks!"

","So I just went to a pre screening of this film in downtown Chicago and Mr rainn Wilson himself was there to do a Q & A afterwards.<br/><br/>This movie was actually laugh out loud funny, it shows a lot of character sub plots and builds a good and funny funny time telling about each character. This is a go for the win movie and even gave me tingles once and awhile. There is a lot of sub plots and it all works together for the ending. It is about Rainn's character who was in a in a rock band that was on their way to being huge and they kick him out of the band. He starts a band with his nephew and his friends and show them how to be true rockstar giving himself the chance and the dream that was cut from him. I give it a 8 out of 10 and Rainn was a true comic."
"kevin_crighton","8","43","61","19 October 2008"," Hugely enjoyable.
","1986 - Robert 'Fish' Fishman is the drummer of an up and coming rock band called Vesuvius. However, on the night they are offered a massive record deal, they are told there is a catch.... they have to sack the drummer. Twenty years later, Fish is still angry about that, but when offered the chance to play drums for his nephew's rock band at the Prom, he see this as a chance get to live the rock lifestyle he always wanted....<br/><br/>In many ways, The Rocker is a sequel to School Of Rock, in that you have the older band member, with much younger band members. The difference here though, is that they are all in their late teens. But even these similarities don't hide the fact that for it's running time, The Rocker is hugely enjoyable.<br/><br/>The cast, lead by Rainn Wilson are all good. Wilson as Fish gets to over the top as he lives out his dream, and while some of his antics are a bit childish at times, they are probably no worse that what actual bands get up to at times. The fact that the rest of the band, are normal teens makes Fish's antics even funnier.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the band members, yes you do have some clich√©d characters. There is the sensitive lead singer/song-writer, the Indie- spirited girl, and the genius but shy keyboard player. Despite this however, each person develops as the movie progresses, even Fish and while some plot developments in the movie are very predictable, this doesn't detract from the enjoyment.<br/><br/>Peter Cattaneo, who also directed The Full Monty, keeps things moving along nicely. The script, while not a laugh out loud riot (for me anyway), did keep a smile on my face all the way through. The music in the movie is also well done. Not only in the choice of background music, but also the songs that the band have written themselves.<br/><br/>The Rocker will never be remembered as an all-time comedy classic. But for it's running time, it is very enjoyable, keeps you smiling and is very entertaining."

","Peter Cattaneo MBE is probably best known for his hit film, ""The Full Monty."" But here, he really utilizes top character actors and actresses to create some memorable and humorous moments. Rainn Wilson maybe the star but he's not alone. Jeff Garlin and Jane Lynch plays his brother-in-law and sister. Christina Applegate plays the mom of one of the musicians. The story isn't as sweet or vulgar as one would think of today's comedies. The only questionable scene is Rainn's character is naked for the rehearsal which lands him better known as the naked drummer. The beginning is humorous with Fred Armesen and Will Arnett as members of Vesuvius who ditched the drummer, Robert Fishman (Rain's character) right on the verge of stardom. Fish retrieves to having a somewhat normal life even has a normal girlfriend played for a few minutes by Jane Krakowski. Jason Sudekis plays the band's manager. Howard Hesseman plays their RV driver. I loved the casting of this film because of all the familiar faces. Jane Lynch is one of my favorite actresses because she can be both dramatic and comedic at once. This film is rated PG-13 and I think it has to do with that one nude scene but apart from that. They really have a message about working together as a team. This film wouldn't have been made without the teamwork of the cast and crew itself."

","In 1986, drummer Fish (Rainn Wilson) gets dropped when the president of the label wants to replace him with his nephew. Twenty years later, the band has become legendary success while he gets fired from his pointless job. He but really his girlfriend Carol breaks up his relationship. He's forced to live with his sister Lisa and her family. His nerdy nephew Matt (Josh Gad) has a garage band with Amelia (Emma Stone) and Curtis (Teddy Geiger). They lose their drummer and are forced to ask Fish to play with them at prom. It doesn't go well and he goes to apologize. He meets Curtis' mother Kim (Christina Applegate). Lisa kicks Fish out of the house and then their practice with a naked Fish goes viral.<br/><br/>Rainn Wilson is terrific playing this character. He's been playing the same self-delusional slightly-angry loud-mouthed damaged character. The greatness comes from the fact that he's still likable while being a jerk. Sure, it's formulaic sweetness and copying other movies like 'School of Rock'. I don't see that as a defect. The three kids are well cast. Geiger is a good tortured lead and he can sing too. Emma Stone is the adorably dark Emma Stone. Josh Gad is a great nerd."

","This is a terrific, most entertaining movie. Never a dull moment with Rainn Wilson. It's leads and supporting actors are well known for their talent on TV and Saturday Night Live. Once cannot go wrong when combining comedic talent to deliver a fun story. Together they deliver a well paced story full of laughs, Spinal Tap-like moments, and great original songs. The soundtrack is flawless, honestly had to buy it. All the songs are incredibly catchy. I hope that people will re-visit this film and enjoy it and the music as much as I did. Will Arnett, Bradley Cooper, and Fred Armisen steal scenes that will forever be memorable in my mind. Pass it along, word of mouth, this is a film I would love to see gain a following."

","Saw the movie with very low expectations...but was surprised.<br/><br/>I mean seriously, i thought this movie was going to be completely lame, and i was just waiting for that one ""stupid"" moment that defined the movie as a complete Flop,etc. But to my surprise, the movie just seemed to keep getting better! (especially the beginning, with Rain Wilson chasing after his ex-band mates in the van, WOW, i literally almost fell out of my chair! I love unpredictable crazy moments like that...and this movie was full of them.....)<br/><br/>Im a huge fan of Rain Wilson, and I KNOW he's an underdog actor who is not being used to his full potential.<br/><br/>I just LOVE how his character is throughout the movie, he's just got this whole Jack-Black meets Dwight(from the Office) thing going on! He does a very good job of portraying a kind of washed up crazy rock star, yet still very sharp and witty at times....he just seems to be able to switch them on and off during the movie.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was A lot better than i thought, had a very good rock flow to it, yet positive mood.<br/><br/>If you see this movie, go into it NOT expecting much!(just like the trailers make you think) You'll be most likely surprised by all the witty funny moments that just flare out of nowhere!<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>THE GOOD - <br/><br/>-Rain Wilson is VERY funny -He does a good job acting, ""The Office"" fans will like it -Movie has a decent positive storyline IMO -The costumes were PRICELESS -The faces Rain makes, and his quotes were excellent..(not quite as weird/good as the Office, but definitely good enough.) -Alot of unpredictable little quick moments and quotes!<br/><br/>THE BAD -<br/><br/>-I couldn't stand the borderline EMO sounding songs the band played thru-out the movie sometimes!(although Rain was still his hardcore self and never missed a friggin beat!) -The storyline just suddenly moves REAL FAST...then all of a sudden slows back down to normal speed....like how they suddenly get a record contract,etc...."
"crimsonmnd","7","38","65","5 July 2008"," Highly Recommended
","I was lucky enough to see The Rocker at a free screening and laughed all the way through the movie. Very funny. I enjoyed the movie so much, I saw it again at another screening, and it was just as funny the second time. Rainn Wilson turns in a very good performance as Robert ""Fish"" Fishman in his movie debut, however the part could have just as easily been played by Jack Black. Wilson plays a rock drummer who is kicked out of his band just before they make it big. Fast forward 20 years and he has a chance to live the rock-n-roll dream again with a new band. If you liked ""Almost Famous"" or ""School of Rock,"" then you will like this movie more. While rated PG13, the movie contains no F-bombs or sex scenes and is a movie parents can feel safe letting their teen and pre-teen children go see. Parents will want to see this movie as well."
"meeza","9","39","68","25 August 2008"," The Rocker is a comedic charttopper!
","Some critics have called the latest ""rock-n-roll world"" lampoon flick ""The Rocker"" an incomparable imitation of the critical darling of the same theme ""School of Rock"". To drum it up in simplistic syntax, both films ROCKED!!!!! ""The Rocker"" is not a carbon copy narrative of ""School of Rock""; it does have a musical story life of its own. ""The Rocker"" stars the zany Rainn Wilson as Robert ""Fish"" Fishman, an over-the-top boisterous drummer. Fish was about to dive into the school of ""Rock-Roll Fame & Fortune"" when he was the drummer of an 80's heavy metal band called Vesufius. Just before Vesufius made it to stardom, Fish got the firing bait when the band's agent persuaded the Vesufius band members to let the Fish go so he can be replaced with a recording studio hotshot's son. Therefore, Fish was a musician out of the musical waters for the next twenty years. That is until Fish's nephew Matt asked Fish to be the drummer of his high school band entitled A.D.D. (are you with me?, lol) because the original juvenile drummer boy was being a bad boy and got expelled. Fish accepts and the rocker show begins! Fish is one to rebel and follow the beat of his own ludicrous drum and therefore A.D.D. chaos follows. Due to parental control issues of the remaining A.D.D. band members, the band is forced to rehearse each from their own home utilizing technical wizardry so they can view each other. Fish chooses to rehearse in the nude and before you can say ""a little bored girl put it on You Tube and got zillions of hits"" it did that exact same thing. That undoubtedly is the scary ""naked truth"" on the Fish following. Consequentially, fame and fortune follow for A.D.D. as they land a recording contract and tour gigs all over the country. Rainn Wilson's breakthrough performance as Fish was a comedic vivacious delight that should rain him in some more starring comedic roles. I also loved Jeff Garlin's role as the rocker-fantasy suburban dad. Screenwriters Maya Forbes & Wallace Wolodarsky scripted a trendy and modern narrative that symbolized the present youth obsessions & dilemmas in combination with the 80's retro fixations of the forty-year old generation. It was also quite damn hilarious for those young and older. And Director Peter Cattaneo brought the script to cinematic life by orchestrating a fine-tuned comedic machine. ""The Rocker"" might not be nominated for any Oscars, Golden Globes, or even Grammys, but it's a flick that simply (well you know¬Ö) ROCKS in the comedic entertainment ""hysterically laugh out-loud"" record category. ***** Excellent"
"ajk08","7","3","3","28 January 2015"," Feel Good
","This movie is as close as you can get to 90 minutes of feel good film. I'm a fan of Rainn Wilson from (obviously) The Office as well as Super and My Super ex girl fired which are also pretty decent films. Its a shame this bombed at the box office because it really had the potential to be a really GOOD summer movie. <br/><br/>Everyone in the cast does a great job. All the band members have their own 'story' and explored personality which makes you feel much more invested and care about whats actually happening to them. There's 1 or 2 laugh out loud moments with Rainns physical comedy but most of all this is a film to smile and feel good about. Nothing makes you cringe or think that obviously isn't funny and i would definitely recommend it."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","27","47","26 August 2008"," The Rocker has a really funny beginning, even the middle is fun, but the conclusion was horrible
","I don't know why, from the trailer I didn't really want to see The Rocker, it looked like another silly teenage comedy, but I had the opportunity to see it for free and decided to go ahead and give it a fair chance. So I saw it yesterday and honestly, I thought it was a pretty decent comedy, much better than I expected. But it fell flat and became a predictable movie, I don't mind them every once in a while, but this story could have had a better ending that surprised us all. I love Rainn Wilson, ever since I saw him way back in House of 1000 Corpses, I just thought something strange stood out about this guy, he eventually became bigger in the hit TV show The Office. He's now the new male lead in a comedy, now he's decent, he did make me laugh like crazy in a lot of his scenes, but I think he could have held his own a little better, he's good, but he's not great as a leading comedic actor.<br/><br/>He plays Fish, a drummer for a rock band that later goes platinum after kicking him out. His life as an adult isn't so great, the band is doing very well even 20 years later. Fish moves in with his sister, his nephew asks him to play drums in his band when their drummer can't play with them any more, but later Fish gets in trouble with his sister and can't live with her any more. But his nephew sets up a way through the internet and camera's, but when Fish doesn't know the camera is filming him naked, a new internet era is born of the Naked Drummer. ADD, the band he's playing with his nephew, becomes huge and fame takes a tole on the kids as well as Fish's old age.<br/><br/>Now over all, I did like The Rocker, I think it's worth a matin√©e price, it's a fun and silly comedy that gives you a few good laughs. Mainly by Rainn Wilson, I couldn't help but laugh hysterically when he finds out the band is kicking him out and he jumps on the van that they're driving away in and is holding on by his drum sticks, sounds stupid, but when you see the look on his face, it reminds you of The Terminator 2: Judgement Day with the T-1000. Like I said, the ending flops a bit though, I think they could have done something different, but it's a good movie for laughs. Like I said if you want to see it in the theater, I'd recommend the matin√©e, but otherwise it's just a rental.<br/><br/>6/10"
"dfeenz","Null","12","19","30 March 2009"," We Want More Rainn Wilson! Rock On!!
","As a metal/rock musician with a desk job myself, I could really appreciate this simple inspirational story as well as the many laughs it dished out. One line plot summary: Washed up former drummer turned office drone joins nephew's band, gets his mojo back and gets the chance to show the former band, an obvious AC/DC parody/homage, who betrayed him, that he can make it to the top without them. OK so that was a bit of a run-on sentence but anyhoo, with a great setup like that, plus choice casting of Rainn Wilson in the lead, the comedy pretty much writes itself. The story reminds me a little bit of the Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) / Metallica rivalry/hatred what with Mustaine kicked out of the band for his wild antics only to make it on his own without ever selling out. There are several cameos from familiar faces, the casting is perfect. The younger kids in the band are believable characters, not totally reckless and sensationalized like The OC but not given the wuss WWJD treatment of other TV fair like 7th Heaven. There is some underage drinking and pot references, but nobody becomes an alcoholic or a drug addict, just kids experiencing the time of their lives and living their dream as rock stars. The movie never takes itself too seriously but it has plenty of heart and is more than just a vehicle for Wilson's brilliant penchant for playing strangely aloof, yet obsessive characters. One of the comic bits I really liked was where The Rocker is humoring the singer of his Nephew's band, telling him how sweet his mopey, whiny ass lyrics are in this sort of underhandedly sarcastic tone. The movie is not afraid to poke fun at the frivolousness of modern youth's current popular music. That's not to say the songs are no good, but they are definitely a tad emo and gay for this rocker's taste, and I think Rain Wilson's character secretly agrees, but is too excited at the chance to play again to voice his opinion. On the whole, I felt it delivered more laughs than School of Rock with Wilson giving an equally energetic performance to that of Jack Black in said flick. I would recommend one if you like the other for sure. If I have one complaint about this movie it's this oddly treated subplot of the chick in the band getting knocked up, presumably by the singer. It is sort of brought up and never really dealt with or resolved. Not that I care about whether or not they had a baby or whatever, just saying why put drama in a movie just for drama's sake and then not take it anywhere? Should have just left that out it was kinda irking me I think they threw that in there because they realized hey the movie's halfway over and nothing remotely serious has happened. The first ten minutes or so of this movie are yispecially hilarious, excellent opening. I would easily rank the chase scene in the top ten funniest movie moments of 2008. ""Dude...he can't be killed...He can't be killed dude! Drive! Drive!"""
"C-Younkin","5","31","58","20 August 2008"," Wilson is not Will Ferrell
","Late August used to be a dumping ground for crappy movies, but now look at how ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" has changed all that. The ""sleeper hit"" genre has become a key part of August, so much so that it's hard to tell the difference anymore. Take ""The Rocker"" for example, the first starring role for Rainn ""Dwight"" Wilson from ""The Office"", a seemingly crappy movie that is already bouncing around the title of ""The Summers Sleeper hit."" Now usually the ""sleeper hit"" genre has been attached to Judd Apatow-related flicks like ""Virgin"" and last summers ""Superbad"", and its really hard to picture Wilson in a lead role at all so this all seems like a pretty hefty claim, but the question remains, is ""The Rocker"" a crappy movie or is it a sleeper hit? <br/><br/>Wilson plays Fish, the drummer for up and coming 80's metal band Vesuvius. Just when the band is about to make it big, Fish is cut out of it, leading to 20 years of working dull, soul-crushing jobs while Vesuvius quickly becomes one of the biggest bands ever. Some salvation comes his way in the form of his nephew's High School band, A.D.D. The band has just lost its drummer to a High School prank and is in desperate need of a replacement, leaving them with no one else to turn to except Fish. The band, which includes nephew Matt (Josh Gad), brooding lead singer Curtis (Teddy Geiger), and lone girl bassist Amelia (Emily Stone) is at first reluctant to accept the nearly forty year old drummer but in a plot twist that can only happen in movies, a Youtube video they make leads to big time fame. Soon A.D.D is playing the clubs and Fish is even romancing Curts' young mom (Christina Applegate). Just like all bands, they are not without their conflicts.<br/><br/>Wilson comes from the Will Ferrell school of comedy, in that he goes for cheap and sophomoric material. The movie relies on vomit, sweating, Wilsons flabby body jiggling in the wind, and when all else fails, him getting hit with something or a pratfall. Sure the shock value from these things is worth a chuckle sometimes but he doesn't have the same sort of buffoonish innocence that Ferrell does and a lot of what makes this kind of material hilarious is the sort of personality doing the delivery. Wilson doesn't seem to have it and so a lot of the jokes just look like what they are, cheap and sophomoric. And the story doesn't help either. It follows ""School of Rock's"" storyline pretty closely of build a band, learn life lessons, encounter a problem, and finally rock out in front of a huge crowd. Just ""Rock"" had an infectious enthusiasm for music as well as a sweet side but this is more a generic retread of most stories about the successes and perils of starting a band. No real surprises here.<br/><br/>The cast does OK. I'm not saying Wilson is a bad comic actor but this material doesn't seem suited for him at all. All the 80's headbands and weird outfits can't disguise the fact that he's better playing a much weirder character like Dwight from ""The Office"". Christina Applegate seems to light up any film she's in and I wish she was given more screen time here. Emma Stone, Josh Gadd, and Teddy Geiger each get do their best in throwaway roles as musicians dealing with teenage angst. Will Arnett and Fred Armisen are both pretty funny as Fish's old band mates and Jeff Garlin and Jane Lynch are pretty much wasted in unfunny roles. There is one person who makes out like a bandit in this movie though and that is Jason Sudeikis as the A.D.D's asshole manager. Known to me only for a recurring role on ""30 Rock"", he gets the best lines and when he gets them he knocks them out of the park.<br/><br/>""The Rocker"" itself just doesn't rock though. It just felt too cheap and sophomoric, too conventional, too much of a waste of talented actors, and above all, a completely wrong type of vehicle for Rainn Wilson."
"imdb-21622","6","4","5","6 May 2010"," Enjoyable light movie
","So, when I watch movies, I don't look into their depths. I either enjoy them, or I don't.<br/><br/>The start of the movie really brought me into it. It was so over the top it was funny. You kept thinking his band was done with him, and he came back to attack them. Classic.<br/><br/>OK the story is totally unrealistic. Who cares. I laughed. That's all that matters.<br/><br/>You have to like rock and roll, rock and roll clich√©s, and you have to watch this with no serious intent. If you don't appreciate the rock and roll clich√©s or light humor, go watch something serious.<br/><br/>I realize some people complained that Wilson was channeling Jack Black a little. But I think he had a bit of his own thing too. Aging rocker trying to relive his youth. Those of us old enough to understand that get it. Some of you won't.<br/><br/>The cast who played the teenage kids did great. The ""nerd"" could have had a little more personality, but he did fine. The emo guy was great. The girl was great too.<br/><br/>I gave this a 6 out of 10 for being entertaining, which is more than many movies manage. I laughed out loud quite a few times which most movies can't manage."
"KineticSeoul","8","4","5","6 November 2009"," This movie rocks!
","The title of this movie is ""The Rocker"" and it's PG-13, so I was hesitant in renting this. But I am very surprised at this comedy, what I thought would be something mediocre turned out to be something so much more. Now I can't say this is one of the funniest comedy I have seen, but it is very well crafted. This comedy was hugely entertaining and kept me smiling from beginning to end. Robert 'Fish' Fishman(Rainn Wilson) is kicked out of the glam rock band Vesuvius after the manage of the band offers them a great deal to make them famous, the only catch is they have to replace Fish the drummer with the president of the labels son. And Fish is very angry about this and holds a major grudge, but seriously who wouldn't and this takes place in 1986. But twenty years later he gets a second chance at stardom when his nephew Matt asks him to join his band A.D.D and be the drummer. And now Fish must use every wit he has about rock 'n' roll to reclaim his throne. I must say this is one of the few comedies where the jokes doesn't seem that random, and the rock star parodies were pretty damn funny. The part with the clich√©d rock stars was freaking hysterical and watching Fish partying like a typical rock star to catch up for lost time just adds to the comedy. I am so glad the creators didn't use Jack Black in this movie, cause Rainn Wilson is electric in this. Plus he contributes a lot to the new band he is in without being annoying a looking genuine, despite him being the oldest of the group and inspires the members and help them out with there struggles. The band has a awkward combination of members, but it works really well. Although I really disliked the lead singer and he even calls Fish a joke when he himself is a whinny emo douche. First of all that whinny emo douche has abandonment issues cause his dad left him, and Fish has a grudge against the band that left him to rot. And he turns his back on Fish who contributed the most for the band and got them to stardom, cause without him it just wouldn't have happened, even if YouTube played a bit part as well. He was more annoying than the band's manager. Emma Stone who plays one of the band members fit right in as well, while playing the girl that is always irritated by everything, she was still likable. The MILF(Christina Applegate) in this was actually attractive, cause they usually aren't no matter how many of the characters in films try to make them out to be hot, especially Stifler's mom. Let me tell you the songs in this movie is very corny but it's still somewhat catchy so it isn't unbearable and I didn't find myself hating the music. ""The Rocker"" is actually a pretty clever comedy, just don't try to act more intelligent than the other audiences and just enjoy life, and if you have this mentality I am pretty sure your going to enjoy the heck out of this movie. I sure did. It's a enjoyable and entertaining comedy. <br/><br/>8/10"
"robnobleeddy","5","29","58","25 June 2008"," Decidedly average
","I saw this when it was shown as the ""Surprise Movie"" at the Edinburgh Film Festival. However, the choice of movie was the only surprise I got that night, as this turned out to be an average movie with an entirely by the numbers plot.<br/><br/>Comparisons with ""School of Rock"" and ""Dewey Cox"" are inevitable, but in reality you've seen this movie many times before. It's the classic story of the down and out who get's a second chance, almost messes it up, but pulls it off in the end. In this case, ageing rocker 'Fish' (Wilson) is still bitter about being dumped as drummer by hit rock band 'Vesuvius' some 20 years ago. At a low ebb, Fish finds himself being recruited in to his nephews band to the play their high school prom. One serendipitous moment later and the newly formed 'A.D.D.' are off on tour.<br/><br/>Does the expected hilarity ensure? Almost. Unlike some other recent American comedies, this one remembers that it's supposed to make the audience laugh, but it does so too infrequently and without any stand out moments. The real problem is that, barring a few side plots, the entire course of the film can be predicted from the first ten minutes, and the occasional snigger is unlikely to be enough to hold the audiences attention. A few hours after the movie I struggled to remember one memorable scene - not the sign of a classic comedy.<br/><br/>None of the cast offer anything other than a solid performance, although Emma Stone, and especially Jason Sudeikis as the band manager, do stand out as providing most of the good scenes and laughs. The band as a whole have little charisma, especially the moody lead singer, and I felt little desire for them to succeed.<br/><br/>To some extent this movie is saved by its songs. To the best of my knowledge the score is original, and both the tracks played by the heavy metal band 'Vesuvius' and the more mellow, teenage angst of 'A.D.D.' are great. In the end it is the gig scenes that end up providing the films best moments.<br/><br/>This film is best described as ""School of Rock"" without the school, or the screen presence of Jack Black. And without that there's not a whole lot left. This movie is not offencive, but there'll always be something better to see when you go to the cinema, and it's all the more disappointing when you consider that the director is capable of better things."

","The trailers or the marketing materials don't do this film any justice. I got to see it couple of weeks ago at a pre-screening and had already made up my mind that I was provably gonna hate it (because i had seen the trailers, and the posters didn't exactly draw my attention). But hey, free movie, and some free time, who's gonna say no to that? I was delightfully surprised to see an ""original film"" on theaters again. Something that was not a sequel, or a remake, or some cookie cutter flick. And I'm not a big music fan, but its got a good beat and i can dance to it LOL The film has a great story and you fall in love with the characters right away. I would have loved to have seen Jack Black playing the lead role but Rainn Wilson was perfect. There's sort of an unpolished subplot with the girls father, but i guess I'll let you be the judge of that.<br/><br/>Christina Applegate is HOT. She's come a long way from married with children and plays her character brilliantly.<br/><br/>I liked the girl band member, she actually did a great job with her character, though something about her just reminds me of Lindsay Lohan, not sure if she looks like her or she just plays the character the way Lohan would have played it, though could have been more unique.<br/><br/>Character-wise she just doesn't look dark enough for what I think the writers were going for.<br/><br/>If you get a chance take a date and check it out. You'll have plenty of good material to talk about over dinner."

","Good laughs that built over time as u started relating more and more to Rainn and his need to get back in the game. He knew he could still rock, and like anyone who missed their chance always regret it later in life. The whole movie was very realistic and the party life isn't truly as good as u remembered, nostalgia can't be recreated. I love the music, i was very surprised by the perfect mix of melodies and hard rocking. I was only slightly disappointed with jane lynch's few lines she had, she didn't really contribute much. I loved the rest of the family though, fighting 4 Rainn. The movie didn't have any truly qoutable lines but had many memorable funny moments that made me chuckle next day.

Rainn Wilson ( he of The Office fame). There is something about Wilson that just makes you watch. It's not even that he plays likable characters but there is something about him that is fascinating. Put say Jack Black in this role and I'm pretty sure the results would be far less desirable. Add in the gorgeous and very talented Emma Stone and really there isn't a lot to hate about this film. <br/><br/>Yes in parts it's fairly predictable but it's always enjoyable as the downtrodden Wilson finally gets his shot at the big time.

","Fish (Rainn Wilson) got his heartbroken in 1986 by his band called Vesuvius. He was the lead drummer, and was told to be replaced by their agent. They originally refuse, but when they are told they will be opening for Whitesnake, the band betrays him, and manages to escape a vengeful attack from Fish. Fish's dream comes to an abrupt halt. Not only does Fish lose his job, because the people he works with love Vesuvius, but his girlfriend kicks him out of their house. Fish is forced to live with his Sister (Jane Lynch) When he learns about his nephew (Josh Gad) having a band, Fish gets another crack at living the dream, when his nephew's band very reluctantly gives him the lead drummer position. The band gets unusually noticed when a session on a web-cam leads to Fish practicing naked, and it gets a ton of You Tube Hits. <br/><br/>Okay. So it's not rocket science, it's not an Oscar winner, it's highly predictable, but damn. It's great entertainment. I really don't understand why movie fans have to be such sticklers at times. What did you honestly expect coming into this movie, a thought provoking film? It's set to entertain the masses, and it does that extremely well. What makes The Rocker work so well, is the energy and the cohesiveness of the cast. Every member of the band is really amiable, and I enjoyed embarking on their journey. This does have crude humor in it, provided by the hilarious Rainn Wilson. I laughed at a lot of it, and enjoyed the slapstick. The predictability didn't bother me one iota, because it was so well done. I had a general idea of how this movie was gonna end. I knew retribution for Fish would happen, but I still enjoyed the ride. Predictability isn't always a bad thing. The Rocker is a perfect example of that. Critics and movie fans alike tend to forget what is so vital to a movie's success. To me it's entertainment. If a movie is able to entertain, it's doing its job. It also has a very good message to it. It shows that you should never give up on your hopes and dreams, no matter how hard you have to work to ascend back to the top. <br/><br/>Rainn Wilson is a funny guy, plain and simple. It amazes me that unfunny people like Will Ferrell, Adam Sandler (These days he is, he used to be funny) and Kevin James make millions at the box office with their abhorrently awful movies, yet Rainn Wilson tends to go unnoticed, compared to them. His idiotic, yet likable character had me in stitches, especially the naked stuff that made him a hit on you tube. Josh Gad makes for an amiably, nerdy nephew, and I enjoyed his low key, but funny performance. Ted Geiger is a guy that females will love. He's got that leadership quality. Christina Applegate was just great as Geiger's Mom. She stole a lot of scenes, and I couldn't get enough of her. Emma Stone shows why she's become one of Hollywood's biggest female stars, with her girl next door persona. I loved her. Jason Sudeikis admittedly has a few funny lines here. He's not a favorite of mine, but I found him amusing here. Will Arnett & Bradley Cooper are fun as members of the arrogant Vesuvius. I doubt Bradley Cooper will talk about this movie very often in interviews, but he was fun. Jane Krakowski also has a role, and Jane Lynch is good as well<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: It's good entertainment. I think its rated way too low. I highly recommend it. It'll deliver plenty of laughs and smiles. Isn't that what counts? <br/><br/>7.8/10"
"Hey_Sweden","7","2","2","1 June 2013"," Rock 'n' roll comedy does have some laugh out loud moments.
","After achieving fame on the TV series 'The Office', actor Rainn Wilson here shows himself capable of carrying a feature film, in this vehicle. It's got some heart as well as some degree of silliness, and it doesn't conclude as well as one might like, but it does do its job, and keep entertaining the viewer for a well paced 103 minutes.<br/><br/>Wilson indeed is playing the kind of part one could also easily see Jack Black playing: Robert ""Fish"" Fishman, wildman drummer for Vesuvius, a rock band on the rise, whose bandmates cruelly kick him out just before what could have been a life changing event. He spends the next 20 years bearing a grudge and deeply resenting his lot in life when an opportunity presents itself. Fish's nephew Matt (Josh Gad) is keyboardist for a high school band named A.D.D., and they need to replace their drummer in time for the prom.<br/><br/>In record time, this band begins to take off, and the members - also including singer / guitarist / creative force Curtis (Teddy Geiger) and bass player Amelia (Emma Stone) - find themselves having to deal with a crazed Fish desperate to live out all the decadent rock 'n' roll dreams he never got to realize before.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this is a pretty, if not entirely, predictable affair. At least it doesn't act as if a romance between Fish and Curtis's hottie mom Kim (Christina Applegate) is inevitable. It goes utterly over the top in the early going (that bit with the incensed Fish pursuing his Vesuvius bandmates is priceless), but for most of the rest of the picture, it's a little more down to Earth.<br/><br/>Wilson proves to be fearless (witness the naked drummer routine) and delivers a performance of true enthusiasm. His castmates are equally appealing. Jeff Garlin has his moments playing Fish's brother; also co-starring are Jane Lynch, Jason Sudeikis, and Howard Hesseman; it's hilarious to see Will Arnett, Bradley Cooper, and Fred Armisen in long hair wigs as they portray the other members of Vesuvius (and affect ridiculous faux English accents near the end). Appropriately enough, Pete Best, the man infamous for being the drummer fired from the Beatles, has a cameo.<br/><br/>Overall ""The Rocker"" is likable enough and amusing enough to qualify as agreeable entertainment while it lasts. It may not be terribly memorable, but it is quite easy to take.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","""The Rocker"" isn't a masterpiece, but it is a fun ride. It has it's clich√©s, but it's alright. I can allow that, and it didn't keep me from enjoying this movie.<br/><br/>It tells the story about a drummer called Fish ( Rainn Wilson) who once was kicked out and betrayed by his band. The band, Vesuvius, became one of the most successful heavy metal bands, and Fish, 20 years later, has become nothing, and is still depressed. Then, suddenly he is given a second chance with a new band, called ADD.<br/><br/>Rainn Wilson is the perfect actor for the role of Fish. I really like him in ""The Office"", and in this one, he plays in many ways the same type of character. He's still hysterically funny at times, and is the main reason for the success of this movie. Emma Stone is as always great, but I had some problems with the other two band members, played by Teddy Geiger and Josh Gad. Honestly, I don't know why, but anyway, I didn't like them that much. Last, but not least, I have to mention Jason Sudeikis, who made me laugh almost every time he made me laugh. . <br/><br/>Putting aside the humor, the story is good. There are some drama- elements which is really good. At times it becomes a little emotional, in a positive way. Some may be touched by it. <br/><br/>Watch it. Especially, If you like Indie-rock, you may like it even more than me."

You really feel for Fish throughout the movie because everyone can relate to him; we all have had unfulfilled dreams at least once in our lives. This movie will appeal to all ages as was evidenced by the applause at the end and from peoples' great comments to the promoters after the show. It is very refreshing to see a movie with no sex or violence that everyone can enjoy.

","First of all, don't listen to the School of Rock comparisons. I can see how and why people are comparing the two films, but it's not really accurate. Don't get me wrong, School of Rock was a good movie, but so is this one and they're quite different. After Fish (Rainn Wilson) is dismissed as drummer of the band Vesuvius he attempts to get on with his life, but never quite leaves his rocker persona behind. This isn't School of Rock when Dewey was forcing kids into a band to fulfill his life's dream. In The Rocker, an established band of high school kids, A.D.D., takes a chance on Fish as their last resort. True, both Dewey and Fish are pure rockers at heart who live to jam and share their music, but the way they go about it is different. The Rocker is surprisingly laugh out loud funny at times and it has a lot of heart. Rainn Wilson is a really good fit here as this character. Great supporting cast too. And the music ain't too shabby!"
"princesspuffpuff22","7","8","16","18 June 2008"," Effective film launch for Rainn Wilson
","Rainn Wilson effectively steps away from his Dwight character with this teen comedy. Parts of this comedy are intelligent, and it's certainly not a crude comedy. But it does sway into the teen category more than I would have liked. However, this film should be a good launching pad for Wilson to star in more films (fingers crossed!) The film's plot has often been compared to School of Rock. And there are definitely some similarities that cannot be ignored. However, the film's plot does stand on it's own. It's a fun comedy about facing the past and living in the present.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is fun entertainment, and great for the whole family.

The comedy was bad, and the music was even worse. Definitely a soundtrack I won't be purchasing. I was expecting some decent musical talent in this film, and there was none. Rainn Wilson's performance was bad, too,and I'm disappointed that Christina Applegate chose to appear in this film. Obviously it was charity work on her part. I can't really think of one positive thing to say about the film. Maybe I was just in a foul mood when I saw it? Not likely. Bad comedy + really bad music = bad movie. On a scale of 1-10, I'd give the storyline a 4, the acting a 3, the comedy a 2, and the music a 1."
"keiichi73","4","10","22","20 August 2008"," Completely conventional. Not much new here.
","If there was ever a movie that needed Jack Black, this is the one. The lead character in The Rocker almost seems to be written with him in mind, and I don't know, maybe it intended to be a starring vehicle for him at one time, but other projects got in the way. Whatever the reason, it's impossible not to think what kind of energy he'd bring to this film - Energy that Rainn Wilson (the actor who does headline this movie) cannot supply, despite his best efforts. At least he seems to be trying.<br/><br/>Wilson plays Robert ""Fish"" Fishman, a washed up drummer who lost his chance at stardom back in 1986 when he was the drummer for a rising heavy metal hair band named Vesuvius, only to have his bandmates ditch him right before fame came knocking for the group. His attempt to stop his former friends from running away from him brings about an inspired comic sequence, where Fish seemingly develops superhuman abilities while chasing after their fleeing van. He can run at impossible speeds like a human Terminator, and he then leaps on top of the van, and punches holes through the roof with his drum sticks, causing his bandmates to scream in terror. I laughed a lot at this sequence. I liked its goofy tone, which seemed to be parodying horror films, and it set my mind at ease early on that director Peter Cattaneo (The Full Monty) would be giving the movie a likeably offbeat sense. As soon as this sequence ends, however, the movie goes on total auto pilot and never looks back.<br/><br/>Robert is now jobless, homeless, and holding a major grudge against his former band, which has gone on to chart-topping success. Opportunity comes knocking while Robert is living at his sister's house, trying to get his life together. His nephew, Matt (Josh Gad), is in a high school garage band called ADD, and they have recently lost their drummer right before their first gig at the school's prom. Matt asks Robert to fill in as a last resort, much to the dismay of his two fellow bandmates - lead singer and songwriter Curtis (Teddy Geiger), and cynical guitarist Amelia (Emma Stone). They eventually welcome Robert into the band, since he can get them other gigs, and they find their popularity quickly building, especially after Robert becomes an Internet sensation when a video of him drumming naked becomes a hit on Youtube. Seemingly in a matter of weeks, the band is going on tour, selling out massive concert halls, and releasing hit CDs.<br/><br/>The Rocker seems to know just how derivative it is, as it races through its various pre-required stops, almost as if it was checking its clich√©s off one by one. Robert gets a love interest in the form of Curtis' mom (Christina Applegate), who accompanies the band on tour. Despite Applegate getting second billing in the cast, though, her character barely registers, and her plot hardly goes anywhere. There are relationships within the band itself, as young Matt has his eyes on a girl who appears at all of their concerts, and Amelia and Curtis keep on exchanging meaningful glances at each other, but can't speak their feelings. These are dealt with the same lack of interest, almost as if the screenplay is just throwing these ideas out there, but doesn't want to do anything with them. And of course, there has to be turmoil amongst the bandmates. There's a slimy manager who pops up now and then to manipulate Curtis into turning against Robert, but this brief spat is resolved about two scenes later, so we're left to wonder why the movie bothered in the first place. This film is so haphazard and lazy in its tone that even the band getting arrested and going to prison isn't a very big deal in this movie.<br/><br/>Instead of creating characters or situations that we can care about, we're left with a lot of music montages, which seem to make up 80% of the film's middle. But, at least the music was able to distract me a little from most of the film's humor, which seems to be under the rule that seeing Rainn Wilson getting hit in the face or the privates gets funnier each time it tries it. When he's living at his sister's house early on in the film, it seems to be designed for him to hit his head or fall backwards over something, almost as if The Three Stooges had built the house. I can just picture someone on the construction crew while the house was being built asking why they were making the ceiling and boards in the attic so low, and the head foreman saying, ""Trust me, it will be funny when some guy has to live up here someday"". Even when he's not in the house, he seems to be a magnet for bees flying in his mouth, tree branches smacking his face, and TV boxes in hotel rooms striking his crotch.<br/><br/>Despite its message of embracing a rebellious spirit and never giving up on your dreams, The Rocker is completely substandard and instantly forgettable. This almost seems to be the kind of movie the month of August was made for. It's not exactly bad, but there's absolutely nothing that stands out about it. Now that the big summer movies have come and gone, it's time for the movies that won't be remembered a month from now. If only the movie had kept the same level of insanity of its first five minutes. Then The Rocker would be a movie worth seeing."
"Trythewine","3","10","22","16 July 2008"," Disappointing for Rainn Wilson's first big gig.
","I went to a pre-screening in DC and left feeling happy that it was free. If you love Dwight and the Office, then this movie is not for you. I was unaware of the plot going in to the film, but went only to see Rainn Wilson, in what I thought was an adult comedy. That couldn't have been further from the truth. This is a teeney bopper film that will go over well with the 12-18 age group, but offers little for the seasoned movie goer.<br/><br/>Without divulging the plot and describing each scene, I will just say that The Rocker starts out really strong with a hilarious slap-stick beginning and then fades into a long and drawn out teen dramedy with too few laughs to hold it all together.<br/><br/>I think Rainn Wilson still has potential. I just hope he gets and adult movie role."
"Anonymous_Maxine","2","7","14","28 August 2008"," If you need a good nap, check out The Rocker.
","I think we've all been spoiled by good music movies, like Almost Famous (which, incidentally, Rainn Wilson was actually in) and School of Rock, or at least funny ones, if not necessarily good, like Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny. From the trailer you can quickly gather that The Rocker is not a serious movie; it's about as serious as Step Brothers. What you can't gather from the trailer is that The Rocker is also as dumb as Step Brothers. Probably dumber.<br/><br/>It immediately starts out with intolerable goofiness, as Robert Fishman is kicked out of his 80s caricature band and turns into a movie monster. He chases his terrified bandmates down the street on foot at 60mph, jumping on top of the van and clawing his way across the roof using his drumsticks as hooks to pull himself along. When they slam on the brakes and send him flying into the street, first he appears to be dead but soon sits up like a zombie and turns his head like he's possessed. Thus is the tone set and your eyes can safely glaze over for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Cut to 20 years later, where he is working a dead-end job sitting in front of a computer (I'm just now realizing the irony of me sitting here writing that last sentence), while his former bandmates have gone on to massive superstardom. Luckily, he soon finds his calling when a bunch of whiny high school kids ask him to play with their band as the drummer for their senior prom.<br/><br/>All of the typical scenes are thrown in, the auditions for the new drummer where you get a whole stream of bizarre lunatics doing something ridiculous on the drums or the electric keyboard, the drummerless bandmates whining and lamenting their terrible luck when their idiot drummer boy gets grounded for bringing hash brownies to a Spanish convention at school, the caricature characters, etc.<br/><br/>The Rocker is a bland, flavorless combination of things like Youtube, MySpace, cheesy 80s rock, mind-numbing product-placement and, say, some kind of cardboard breakfast cereal. It is so uninteresting and so unfunny that it's amazing to me that the thing was ever made. I get the feeling that it is purely because of the success of other rock comedies that this one was even considered.<br/><br/>What happens is, through his lack of understanding of modern technology (despite having a 40-hour a week job working in front of a computer), ""Fish"" does a virtual rehearsal one day with his band completely nude, thinking the webcam is a microphone. The video winds up on Youtube and it's an instant hit. Record labels come knocking on the door, and the gigs start lining up.<br/><br/>What follows is an exercise in coming up with scenes where Fish can act as inappropriately as possible, showing that he not only failed as a musician, but fails as a human being in understanding even the simplest things about interacting with other people. Does rock really corrupt the mind like that?<br/><br/>Almost without exception the jokes fall completely flat, like dominoes. Do you ever do that thing with dominoes where you stand them up all in a big line all over the house and then push one over and watch them all fall down and then you laugh and cheer and then immediately start looking dejectedly at the big mess you now have to clean up? Well, I haven't done that for quite some time now, but I remember enjoying it much more than I enjoyed The Rocker.<br/><br/>Of course the good looking but perpetually depressed lead singer in the high school band is going to eventually start to notice the brooding and perpetually depressed girl in the band in ways that he hadn't noticed her before. At a key moment in the film, he asks her if she'd like to have dinner with him, and he has to ask twice before she gets what he's saying. In response, she smiles for the first time in the movie, and I slap my forehead in disgust for about the 200th time. <br/><br/>The development of their little crush is so goofy and so childish that it's almost weird. And no, I'm not going to apologize for ruining the kiddie romance at the end of the movie. If you don't watch The Rocker because you read this review, you should thank me!<br/><br/>As is to be expected, there comes a time when Fish and his new high school band must open for Vesuvius, the band that Fish was booted out of 20 years before. Incidentally, Vesuvius is headed by lead singer Lex, a Bret Michaels lookalike played by Will Arnett, who should have had the lead role in the movie. I'm sorry, but Rainn Wilson is just not funny. The superstar band has what their jerkoff manager calls an ""Ashley Simpson situation,"" and they're booed off stage. The subsequent chanting of ""A.D.D."" (the high school band's name, possibly the most creative thing in the entire movie) over and over again is currently topping my list of Most Predictable Scenes of 2008.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, the only thing that wasn't flat-out stupid about The Rocker is Christina Applegate's character, who is well-written and performed, at least until late in the movie when she begins to adjust her behavior in order to adhere to the necessary Hollywood ending. She has clearly come a long way as an actress, but as is the case for just about everyone else involved, The Rocker is a huge step backwards."

I like Rainn Wilson and i enjoyed him in this movie, but he couldn't carry all by himself and he was given almost nothing to work with. The rest of the cast gave at least journeyman like performances but the plot and the music were somewhere between weak and abysmal. I was also left with the distinct impression that this movie was written for Jack Black and I really think it was a bad career move for Wilson to accept his cast offs, or try to fit into the second tier of the niche Black has created for slobby but amiable over aged rock star wannabees... it can't be that big a market."
"dexterneptune","1","9","20","28 May 2009"," Absolutely terrible...
","I'm beginning to wonder if I even saw the same movie as most of the reviewers on IMDb. Words cannot even begin to describe the truly awful nature of this misbegotten freak-show.<br/><br/>To begin, ""The Rocker"" is hands-down not funny, unless you're 10 years old or stoned. Don't get me wrong - I understand it's supposed to be stupid. But there's the ""Gradma's Boy"" and ""School of Rock"" brand of stupid (which are both funny), and there is this monstrosity. The entire movie's comedic content consists of a litany of awkwardly delivered jokes that fall flat on their faces and some half-hearted slapstick. I think Rainn Wilson is a pretty funny guy, but his delivery resembles the performance of a high school drama student attempting to mimic Jack Black. He has the gestures, intonation, and facial expressions pretty close, but then you realize that somebody already acts like this - Jack Black. Same thing for the rest of the cast, with the occasional exception of Jason Sudeikis - all reading embarrassingly bad jokes that were obviously written by a teen-movie comedy writer. Everything that was attempted in this movie has been done more skillfully in ""Rock Star"" and ""School of Rock."" Next, I thought I would be treated to an 80's hair metal feast. Not so. To tell you the truth, I can't really remember if any real songs were in this soundtrack besides Twisted Sister's ""I Wanna Rock"" and Foreigner's ""Feels Like the First Time."" No. That is not enough. That is not acceptable in a movie titled ""The Rocker"", about a washed-up, bitter, ex-80's hair metal drummer. There are some pseudo-80's hair songs played by the antagonist band of the story, Vesuvius, but they, like the jokes, seem like cheap imitations of more talented artists. This might be expected from an 80's band that never quite made it to the big time, but the writers of this movie would have you believe that everybody on the face of the planet is stupid for Vesuvius. Not very convincing when the best songs come out sounding like third-rate Ratt. Does anybody really think everybody and their moms would be listening to this? Please. And I love hair-metal. Even so, the fans of Vesuvius can simultaneously stomach the poppy, sugar-coated tunes of A.D.D., the high school band that Fish joins. Which brings up another point.<br/><br/>A.D.D's music sounds like the result of a foursome between The Jonas Brothers and Avril Lavigne. Absolute dreck. Somehow, you're supposed to believe that this band would open for a multi-platinum glam-band sensation. But, apparently, the fans don't seem to care, because the same ones that are bobbing their heads to the catchy emo-esquire licks of A.D.D are still there throwing up the horns when Vesuvius comes out to ""rock."" And don't forget to throw in gratuitous shots of fans, parents, and manager smiling along to the juicy beat of A.D.D., as if they're thinking to themselves, ""Man, these kids are GOOD! Go for it!"" How does A.D.D. shoot to the top in a matter of months to become the second most popular band in the world (soon to be first)? Easy - a bootleg video of one of their practices uploaded to YouTube catches the attention of a major label's manager/producer, who shows up at their door to sign a record deal. Take note fledgling bands - it's that easy. A parent meeting is called shortly after, and after a feeble ""discussion"" about something, all the parents decide that it's a great opportunity to let the kids go on tour by themselves. Literally, the discussion lasts like 5 minutes, with each parent successively caving in after each other. Tripe.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end of the movie, there's the obligatory scene of the manager getting fired, complete with the jaw-clenchingly predictable ""you're fired"" line delivered by Fish. The problem is, the manager isn't even really unlikable. He didn't really do anything wrong except suggest replacing Fish, a suggestion he quickly retracts after protestations from the rest of the band mates. Aside from that, he's the guy that walked up to their door and hand-delivered the contract to them that makes them famous and encourages them to get to work. But, I guess the movie needed a bad guy, and he happened to be available. Too bad,because he's the only one who's remotely funny in this beast of a movie.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a 40ish rock band dreamer movie that feels and sounds like it was written by Disney's best, this is the one for you. Or, I suppose if you thought ""School of Rock"" and ""Rock Star"" were too edgy and mature, then you could probably rent this for a family night forced-laugh. Everybody else, stay away from this disappointing heap of dog turds. It's for your own good."

","I realize in the US this is a PG-13 movie, but I live in Manitoba, Canada where it is rated PG, because in Canada we enjoy corrupting 7-year-olds. This movie has physical comedy that maybe your average 7-13 year old (13 at the OLDEST) would find hilarious, it deals with adolescence in a fairly wholesome way that maybe Young Republicans or Young Tories would find compelling, and it is also the billionth Hollywood movie to deal with a man stuck in his youth who won't grow up. So it seems like trying to appeal to everyone and pleasing no one, I would've loved to see a harder edge to this movie instead of the kiddie/family values stuff.<br/><br/>The only reason I saw this movie is because I'm a fan of The Office, and I wanted to see how far Rainn Wilson could carry a starring role in a movie that I wasn't expecting much from. And he's pretty adequate, but actually funnier in the Youtube clips where he kidnaps Jenna Fischer on the set of The Office and says he won't set her free unless ""The Rocker"" grosses $18.7 million in its opening weekend. Kind of sad when amateurish Internet promotion of a movie is funnier than the movie.<br/><br/>Rainn Wilson and Jason Sudeikis (I'm too lazy to look up the spelling of his name) have some good lines, and Emma Stone may have a pretty bright future, but as a big Superbad fan I could be biased about that...other than that, pretty much nothing of value in this movie.<br/><br/>I hope Rainn Wilson manages to get better starring roles, the awfulness of this movie isn't his fault."

I can safely say I won't be rushing to see his next film, if he gets one. You get the feeling that even Will Ferrel couldn't have rescued this steaming pile of manure though to be fair.

","In what is mostly a one man show ¬ñor, band- The Rocker, which follows in the footsteps of many other films remarkably similar to its own, is very much like the band it fronts; sparkly, catchy but totally transparent and generic. As far as rock-band movies go, there isn't much new or original material here, and anyone who calls themselves an expert on the genre will find little to enjoy outside of the lead character and the shenanigans he gets into. It's this distinct lack of momentum or having anything exciting to say that makes The Rocker feel old and tired, lacking any real edge or character that one would normally associate with the rock and roll lifestyle. No, much like lead character Fish states midway through the feature, this movie comes off more like a spectator experience; lightly amusing at times and sporadically interesting, but lacking any real solid ensemble of character and following too many rules regarding structure and pacing, The Rocker feels more like an opening band that you have to sit through in order to get to who you really came to see; unfortunately however, that band isn't playing tonight.<br/><br/>Instead we have A.D.D. fronted by angst-ridden teenage pretty-boy Curtis (Teddy Geiger), a band who play pop-rock el stadio music, that one would think lead character Robert ""Fish"" Fisherman (Rainn Wilson) would actively rebel against as much as drum machines. A veteran of the game from twenty years back, Fisherman is reluctant to help out his nephew's band with a little bit of drumming after having been betrayed by his band back in the eighties. Following a little persuasion however it's not long before A.D.D. are out on the road as Fish attempts to live out his dream of being a rock star whilst the rest of his band mates play video games and sulk in their rooms.<br/><br/>Herein lies where The Rocker loses most of its steam; although Fish is mostly a stereotypical cartoon character, he nevertheless entertains us whilst too often clashing awkwardly with his downright boorish and mundane band mates. Rainn Wilson plays the character as off-wall as possible, often nailing the comedic elements of his personality down well enough to crack a few smiles, and yet the rest of the ensemble fail to engage anywhere near this level. Sure enough it's a decent statement on the difference in times that these characters come from, and indeed that rock and roll has changed, but on a pure entertainment level, this is still a one-man-band affair that plays a catchy enough beat but at the same time lacks the required harmony to truly connect.<br/><br/>Through this distinct difference in character however, The Rocker does establish a fine line of parody regarding classic rockers and rock and roll movies in general; it pokes fun at, and at the same time celebrates the age when rock ruled the world. The majority of this fun of course comes from lead man Wilson who does a great job of impersonating those that have come before him in the genre, whilst keeping a little flavour of his own. People who found Jack Black's performance in the typically similar School of Rock will definitely find something to be amused with here; it's almost the same character transposed a little in regards to exposition. Again, it's a well-enough route to take, but at the expense of ripping off an already established road to success The Rocker rarely does much out of the genre's comfort zone, and with a 12A rating, is given very little room to move in regards to how much rock and roll chaos it can pursue. There's generic and then there's downright formula; The Rocker is akin more to the latter.<br/><br/>The bottom message of The Rocker forms a very loose ""rags to riches"" story to some degree, detailing a lucky few whose dreams come true and are given a chance of a lifetime. The chances are then that if you have seen any movie from the seemingly endless array of genre examples, that you will have seen this one before. It's not a bad effort by any means, no, but it isn't a remarkable one either. Instead it simply takes a by-the-book approach to telling a lightly engaging, sometimes catchy story that will be sure to make you laugh quite a few times, and in this is The Rocker's greatest strength. Fronted by a character that remains as the only memorable element of the feature, this rock show is standard fare pop-rock; catchy, easy to enjoy and acutely structured but at the same time utterly disposable, overly produced and with little soul to punctuate the rock.<br/><br/><ul><li>A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)</li></ul>"

","Its just another teen movie.Rainn Wilson (Robert Fish Fishman) was in a big hair band,living his dreams,until he got kicked out from the band,and never to recover after 20 years.His acting was okay,hilarious at certain moment,but how can a man who grew up in the 70s/80s,listening to musics like Cinderella,kiss etc ended up actually rocking,really enjoying himself and actually feeling the awesomeness living the life he should have 20 years ago in a teen/soft/almost pop rock band???what????and that is why i said,Rainn Wilson was hilarious.I do not think he was living his dreams,its a joke.The story lines is awful,and the end of the story was very very bad.The whole story is a joke anyway,would KISS let band like Busted play on their opening?Oh my God!This movie is a shame to all rock n roll fans,I am truly truly sorry for them.But anyhow,this movie made me laugh a couple of times.Recommended to teens,especially females."
"user-27747","8","6","13","8 June 2008"," Hilarious take on an old subject (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","I had to opportunity to see this movie on Thursday, and it is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while, that is why I rated it an 8. The movie takes place in Cleveland and is about an aging rocker looking to get a second chance at his dream of becoming a rock star. The acting was OK, Rainn Wilson, was hilarious as Fish. His portrayal as an aging rocker who lost out on his opportunity to make it big, only to get a second chance, was quite good. The rest of the cast did a good job as well. The plot was simplistic, an '80s drummer gets forced out of the band just as they are going to make it big. 20 years later, he still feels resentment towards what happened and cannot live it down. He gets and opportunity to become the drummer of his nephew's high school band and is made a band member on the condition that he gets the band a gig.<br/><br/>He eventually gets them a gig, in Indiana, so they steal his sister's car and are on their way to Indiana. After getting arrested for stealing the car, the rest of the band is grounded, and Fish is forced to live in the basement of a Chinese restaurant. His nephew finds a way for the band to rehearse, and after an interesting turn of events, they become an Internet sensation, and are subsequently signed by a record label and go on tour.<br/><br/>I thought the movie would become the type that turns sappy and somewhat romantic, thankfully, that did not occur. If you take this movie for what it is, a good comedy, then you'll be pleased with it. If you expect to see something like The Shawshank Redemption, then you will be utterly disappointed. Overall, it's just a fun movie with some great music.<br/><br/>And for the Rock Band DLC fans, I think Rock Band might announce DLC in conjunction with the movie's release on Friday August 1, 2008"
"Monk5909","10","3","5","22 December 2009"," The Rocker - A Surprisingly Fun Film!
","The Rocker was surprise hit for me. I was very pleasantly surprised by how this comedy unfolded. Too often today's movies rely on huge explosive effects, or even when being sold as comedy, the film is geared towards positioning itself for an Oscar nomination. This film was ""FUN"", not too rough and creates an experience that is based solely on the true comedic brilliance, not only of Rainn Wilson, but the entire cast. It was parody of all things ""ROCK"" that is done with much less raunchy humor than expected. I rediscovered Christina Applegate in this film, one of my favorite actresses' from my youth. The four members of ADD: Rainn Wilson, Josh Gad, Teddy Geiger and Emma Stone's interaction ""gelled' in a way that that was simply superb. Even the ""Deus-ex- Machina"" was not particularly rough by today's standards and worked beautifully to bring this story's plot to its climax. The expected meeting with its unexpected resolution between Fish and Vesuvius, along with Vesuvius' fall from the ""Rock and Roll"" pinnacle, then taking a similar ""Rock and Roll"" historical place as ""Milli Vanilli"" was a truly wonderful conclusion, and, in the case of Vesuvius, was much more richly deserved. This film delivered a fantastic and satisfactory conclusion to the story of Fish, Robert ""Fish"" Fishman! This movie also was and is a wealth of memorable one liner's that will remain with me always. When Kim delivers the ""PILTS"" line to the bands truly awful manager, David Marshall, her delivery and subsequent giggle had me rolling on the floor for 5 minutes. I have read other reviews that knocked the music, but to me that was part of the point of the movie, it had a Rock legend band, Vesuvius ala' ""Whitesnake"" or even a better analogy, IMHO, ""Ratt""! And a new and upcoming band ""A.D.D."". This is an apples and oranges comparison, it's like comparing Led Zeppelin and Fleetwood Mac. This supposed to be a new sound from a new generation of musicians, e.g. if you're looking to hear ""Led Zeppelin"", then play ""Led Zeppelin"", not ""Fleetwood Mac"", but don't waste your time knocking, the other band, because everyone is different, and we all have different musical tastes! I personally liked the music from ""A.D.D."", and that's my choice. Director Peter Cattaneo delivered a story that is brilliant. I had not seen one of his films since ""The Full Monty"", but just like that movie he created a masterpiece that just is not fully appreciated by the general public. His talent is rare. He has the ability to take what could be pure filth, keep it hilariously funny and create a movie, which could be X and becomes PG, without losing any humor, and in fact enhancing it dramatically. For me, this film is far and away the best comedic film that I have seen in 5 or 10 years, and I am going to buy a copy today. There are some films, that for each of us, we can put in the player and watch over and over again and we never really get tired of them. For me ""The Rocker"" is one of those films! To me, for me, this is a 10 star Film!"

There is nothing from beginning to end that doesn't remind you that you're watching one long YouTube/Myspace ad.<br/><br/>The whole 'catch' to this movie is to see the film for the actors, please do the actors a favour and don't see this film, or, if you already have, don't hold it against them, blame the writers.<br/><br/>I gave it a 3 out of 10, rounding up to be fair, because I have actually have seen worse films."

Sure we could see John K., a big player on the show, in his own leading role,Even though it was not so memorable, but Dwight Shrute?<br/><br/>Quite honestly I can say that I had never heard of Rain Wilson before the Office. But Admittedly he is one of the funnier characters. So sure I was on-board to see how he handled the driver's seat of his own movie.

The opening scenes where he is running 60 miles an hour to keep up with his fleeing Ex-band mates was actually pretty funny.<br/><br/>Cut to twenty years later, and we find Fish out of work and living with his not-so-comforting sister played by Jane Lynch. <br/><br/>The story kicks off when Fish's nephew needs a new drummer before playing the prom at school. Fish actually does a good job, except for a little show-boding, and after a quick debate the band makes him one of their own. <br/><br/>Now I am not sure who wrote or sang the songs that the band does in this movie, but they are actually really good. And the young actors who play the band to a stand up job with what little they have to work with. The only one that I really knew was Emma Stone, who appeared in last years ""Supperbad"". I believe that ""Josh Gad"" who plays the nephew was in ""21"" earlier this year, but that role was much more forgettable than this one, although I did find humor in the fact that his mother point out that he has been accepted into MIT. <br/><br/>Once the band reaches stardom thanks to a You-Tube video, which was funny, there follows a montage of the gang doing there very first tour.<br/><br/>And of course there is a falling out and a maniacal Music executive to deal with. But eventually the film ends with Robert having to open for the band he was once kicked out of.<br/><br/>Possible my favorite part is when they finally meet again after twenty years, and all of the band members have British accents.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, this is yet another Hollywood attempt at a quick buck, but it is not the worst attempt they have tried. Its PG13 rating should help its opening weekend, as all kids love stupid comedies. It will be interesting to see how this stacks up to Death Race."

","'The Rocker' is a story of a middle-aged freak (Wilson) who once was in a rock band starting a career, but got back stabbed, and spent the last 20 years holding a grudge, unable to move on with his life. He's a true rocker in his heart and mind: he's got rock and roll in his blood, and it seems like it's the only thing he's able and willing to do. It's not until he looses his dead end job and moves in with his sister (Lynch) and her family that he discovers that his very own geeky nephew (Gad) is in a band himself, and needs a drummer. The movie delivers: there's just no other way to say it. It's funny from the very first minutes, it's not geeky, Rainn Wilson is extraordinary (as always), it features some classic lines, and it has a great cast. It's one of those rare movies that are actually funnier than their trailer, mostly thanks to Wilson, who is a genius. He's the kind of actor you know will go there: if the script asks for drumming butt naked, he'll strip before you finish the sentence. He gives 110% and it shows in his excellent performance; he makes the movie exceptionally believable. He makes you think he had been once a rocker for a famous rock band in deed. Josh Gad, starring as Matt, is pretty amazing. Somehow his talents go beyond his looks, and he becomes something more you'd take him for: he's not your typical fat geek from school. Emma Stone stars as the Shirley Manson-esquire, angry-at-everything keyboard player, but she manages not to be annoying. The cast also features some other great characters, starring Jane Lynch, Jason Sudeikis, Christina Applegate, not to mention Jane Krakowski, Bradley Cooper and Fred Armisen. The movie is not without flaws. Even though it's laughable, you get the feeling it could be funnier sometimes; it's also not as original as it could be. It's 'almost there': it manages to get you laugh, but deep in your mind, you know you've seen this before. That being said, it's a great movie: and what's rare, it's not a complete waste of time."

","The Rocker is a hugely enjoyable comedy about a man who gets a second chance
at life and rock and roll. For Ranin Wilson those terms are interchangeable.<br/><br/>Back in the 80s the rising band Versuvius was told they had to chuck their drummer in order to get a big break. Wilson got the heave ho much the same
way Peter Best got it when Ringo Starr replaced him as drummer for the Beatles.
Best became the answer to a much asked trivia question and we know what happened to those guys from Liverpool and their new drummer.<br/><br/>Flash forward to the new century and these kids who do their music thing in
the garage lose their drummer. Josh Gad remembers that back in the day his
uncle Ranin Wilson was a drummer so Wilson joins Gad and his band mates 
Emma Stone and Teddy Geiger and becomes part of their band.<br/><br/>It's quite a rocky road and the band's first gig at the high school prom ends in
disaster. But Wilson starts fitting in with the kids and the mixed generation
band starts drawing real attention.<br/><br/>Wilson is totally outrageous in a part that must have been offered to Robin
Williams, just the kind of material Williams used to specialize in. Christina
Applegate also appears as Geiger's mom who has a rock and roll background
of her own just might be a permanent romance once Wilson realizes that she
is a mom first.<br/><br/>The climax at the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame where this band originates from
is nicely staged. Wilson with some angst gets to meet the guys that dumped
him. What happens to them is positively poetical.<br/><br/>The Rocker is a film for those who want to be young forever. Some really do
make it like that. For the future Mick Jaggers of the world."

","I only found out about this movie because I was looking for what movies Rainn Wilson did. He will always be remembered as Dwight Schrute from the excellent show The Office and there's nothing wrong with that. When you play that long in a show then your face and character immediately gets recognized whatever else you do. In The Rocker he's funny as well, just like we know him from The Office. Just his mimics alone are already enough to make me laugh. The Rocker is a funny feel-good movie and I certainly did enjoy it. If you are a fan of Heavy Metal hair bands then it's a bonus and totally for you because that's about the only music you will hear during the entire movie. The other actors were all good with their respective performances but let's face it the whole movie is about Rainn Wilson. Enjoyable movie."

'The Rocker' tells the story of Fish, a failed drummer who joins a band filled with high-school goers and sees his second shot at pursuing his dreams. Halfway into the film, you could tell that it was a bit of chick flick. A funny, enjoyable one, but a chick flick nevertheless. <br/><br/>The acting in the film was good, and they were all likable characters. I almost missed Bradley Cooper in a black wig and a tacky vest with a fake British accent, but in case you wonder watching the film, it is Bradley Cooper.

It's certainly funny in places. The acting overall is OK, nobody was terrible, but all the teenage actors really need to work on their chops, especially Teddy Geiger. Rainn Wilson is hilarious. He actually mimes the drums pretty well. I wonder if he actually plays, but who knows.<br/><br/>As for the music. It's terrible! The same lame whiny emo crapola that attempts to be rock, and in fact steals many moves and conventions from rock, but is not now, nor will never be rock. And not to offend any hardcore emo fans who will endlessly debate with me over the differences between underground emo and commercial emo. Frankly, it all sounds like whiny crap, and that's my opinion on that, now back to the movie review.<br/><br/>The songs that the whiny b--ch Curtis come up with want to make me cringe. So your dad left you, get over it! Granted I'm not a child of divorce, but I've had my fair share of problems in my life. As a musician, it feels like a cop-out to base your entire repertoire on one subject and one emotion, in this case, sadness (Linkin Park, I'm talking to you!!!). The fact that the band got as famous as they did in the film astounded me. There are literally a million bands that sound like that today! Geez, can't somebody in their garage come up with a decent racket these days? Nope. And this movie is the nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>Actually, it's amazing how many parallels this film draws between hair metal and emo. Both styles are both painfully simple and highly self indulgent.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you like music-related comedies. Go for it. But stay away from the music, unless you go for that emo crap, in which case I'd recommend a psychiatrist."

","(Synopsis) Robert ""Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson) is the drummer of an up and coming Vesuvius rock n' roll band in the 80's. To get a record deal, the band dumps Fish. The band makes it very big, and Fish has to live with the fact that he could have been a rock n' roll idol. Fish put his dream on hold and for the next 20 years he had to work in an office. Then his nephew Matt (Josh Gadd) enters the picture. Matt needs a drummer for their high school band ""A.D.D."" to play at the school prom. Fish gets the job and this gives him a second chance at a comeback to fulfill his rock n' roll dream.<br/><br/>(My Comment) The movie takes place in the city where the Rock n' Roll Hall of Fame museum is located, Cleveland, Ohio. Rainn Wilson's portrayal as the middle aged man who wants to feel young again and capture his rock n' roll dream was quite good. Everyone can relate and feel for Fish, because we all have unfulfilled dreams in our lives. Fish is able to redeem himself and fulfill his dream. Along the way, Fish learns that his new band has his back unlike his first band. The movie has a combination of slapstick physical comedy, jokes, and some hilarious scenes. Overall, it is a fun movie with some good music. The soundtrack includes some classic 80's rock and some original music. The moral to the story is don't give up your dream.

It's another story of a middle aged man who wants to feel young again, who's been wanting a second chance because¬Ö he didn't get it the first time around but then he learns something valuable along the way. THE ROCKER has enough humor to make you laugh and leave you smiling at the end of the movie. Look at your rear view mirrors, comedy movie stars everywhere because Rainn Wilson is drawing near and he's catching up.<br/><br/>It is a funny movie. Don't get your hopes up and don't have low expectations either, because one way or another, you're going to end up liking this movie. The jokes aren't that raunchy but some are in the borderline. Some scenes are cute and sweet and will make some audiences go 'Aww'. The self-realization moments are not cheesy or too sentimental. I'm glad the movie is still determined to stay cool and rock n' roll throughout the whole thing.<br/><br/>Here you can definitely see the drastic difference from what the 80s thought was awesome and what the present time thinks is awesome as far as music, hairstyle, and clothing go. It's about knowing when to grow up but at the same time knowing not to let go some things that make your spirit feel alive. It's about what it means to be in a band and have each other's back. And it's about appreciating oneself without letting what others say mess with your heads and what it means to Rock! All that and more already covered in Jack Black's School of Rock but instead of kids,¬Ö this time it's geared toward teens.<br/><br/>I like how this movie promotes Rock n Roll Hall of Fame museum in Cleveland, Ohio. It sure receives some publicity from this movie. Despite the fact that I've been to Ohio twice in my whole life, I have yet to visit the site. It will be my my purpose for living.<br/><br/>I just wanna emphasize that THE ROCKER wouldn't have been what it is without Rainn Wilson's excellent performance. His charm and persona is what gives this movie its soul. His comedic timing is as on the target as his ability to endure slapstick physical humor and to change moods and expressions from a careless immature adult into a compassionate, and responsible team player. Maybe Will Ferrell could also do the gig but I don't think he would as good a job."

If you wait until DVD you won't be making a mistake, but I think it will have a wide appeal.<br/><br/>Unlike the other posters so far, I wouldn't recommend taking little ones to it.

But on the night the group signed a huge recording contract, Fish's mates decided to dump him. Twenty years later, Vesuvius has become an immortal rock legend, while Fish works at a call center, twitching at every reference to the group that tossed him.<br/><br/>Fortunately for Fish, his nephew Matt's (Josh Gad) high school garage band, ADD, has a sudden opening on drums. As a last resort, the angst-ridden singer-songwriter Curtis (musician Teddy Geiger) and sad-sack guitarist Amelia (Emma Stone) approach the bitter, middle-aged man to play with them at prom. The gig is ultimately a disaster, thanks to Fish's unrestrained showboating, but a freak video of him drumming naked is leaked onto YouTube and becomes hugely popular. Suddenly, ADD is touring all over Ohio. Fish has been given a chance at redemption, but will he ever let go of his past? Ultimately, anyone who's ever seen more than two movies in their lifetime knows exactly where this story is going, especially after ""The School of Rock"" did it infinitely better a few years ago. The script is so by-the-numbers that you struggle to count the clich√©d situations and plot twists on one hand. It's easy to see that director Peter Cattaneo's film is aimed towards teens, but it often appears as if he's pandering to younger, more easily satisfied audience members. The music symbolizes this perfectly: instead of the rock the title promises, we're treated to multiple performances of bland, instantly forgettable Disney tweener pop.<br/><br/>It wasn't a good sign that the early scenes with Vesuvius made me wish this movie would be about them instead, ""This is Spinal Tap"" style. Will Arnett, Bradley Cooper and Fred Armisen are all hilarious in cameo roles as the band members, and a ""Terminator 2""-like car chase involving them and a dissed Fish is one of the film's highlights.<br/><br/>There are actually several stretches of really inspired, funny stuff in ""The Rocker,"" like Fish's habit of puking in his pocket before a show for good luck, a hilariously wrong reference to John Lennon's corpse and Vesuvius's band members suddenly becoming British. But the film is quick to revert back to its bland story, obvious slapstick or one of 27 shots of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame once something really humorous happens.<br/><br/>Wilson's not bad¬óhe elevates whatever material he can, but Cattaneo isn't completely successful in channeling his unique brand of humor. Instead, he's somewhat squandered, coming off like a manic fusion of Jack Black and Will Ferrell. His goofy faces in the middle of an intense drumming performance are hilarious, though. Stone is really good as Amelia, if not quite as charming as she was in ""Superbad."" Christina Applegate is completely wasted as Curtis's mom, and exists solely to provide Fish with a lame, boring romantic subplot with zero chemistry. Jason Sudeikis from ""SNL"" is the most consistently funny as a sleazy record producer, but even he gets to be a bit too much in the end.<br/><br/>""The Rocker"" isn't terrible by any means; it's just there for audiences to laugh their 10 laughs and forget about it 20 minutes after leaving the theater. Catch another movie you might have missed this summer instead, and save this one for DVD.<br/><br/>** out of ****"

If you liked superbad or knocked up i definitely recommend that you go see this movie when it comes out in august! The combination of strange personalities of the band mates really works well and no one character is over featured. The main roll seems like it would be a Will Ferrel role but without him to run it into the ground the movie had great balance and did a great job of keeping my interest throughout."

","It's difficult to make fun of something that's already as idiotic as heavy metal and the rockers who play it in their egotistical glory. Heavy metal groups like Kiss already seem to be making fun of themselves when they perform. So what can a film like this add? Rainn Wilson is pretty funny as the man-child loser who gets a second chance as a drummer, and Christina Applegate is very convincing in her encouragement and support. In spite of the vulgarity and having to be subjected to seeing Wilson naked, the story is rather sweet, and the original songs and score by Chad Fischer do a good job of supporting it.---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013"

","Currently watching the movie now, it's really late at night or early in the morning however you see it...<br/><br/>Let me begin my review by saying that this movie is underrated (at least here in the UK).<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm giving it more credit than it deserves but for me at least I find it really funny and that's why I am watching it. I even paid ¬£8 via the Sky store as I had no other way of watching it and I'm glad i did because Rainn is hilarious in this movie. It's his idiosyncrasies if anything that make this movie funny. Jason Sudeikis is also hilarious.<br/><br/>The cast is surprisingly good for a relatively low budget film - $15M.<br/><br/>I hate to admit it but I either forgot or didn't even realise Bradley Copper was in it (as one of the rockers in Vesuvius) until I looked up the film on google hahaha!<br/><br/>Oh yea, Will Arnett's performance is very funny also. I wish he was in it a bit more... I want him to do more comedies, he's got potential at least in my eyes.<br/><br/>I'm really surprised Rainn got to do his own movie and I always thought it was based on a subject close to his heart (rock and roll and music) which makes him a lucky guy.<br/><br/>His success in the office must have launched this movie for him and other than Steve Carell he's the only one who's had a big leading role and also his own movie! Congrats!<br/><br/>Here are some of the great cast:<br/><br/>Rainn Wilson
Bradley Cooper!

"Sandcooler","5","2","5","16 July 2011"," Heart-warming at first, quickly loses steam
","The first fifteen minutes of this movie is great, it's filled with beautiful, melancholic scenes. A washed-up musician trying to go for one last moment of fame, that's a story you can get into, and Rainn Wilson plays his role in a fairly convincing way. Sadly, what follows is rather lame and different from what I expected. There's very little actual humor in this movie, the characters are totally one-dimensional (meet alternative teenage girl #9542) and the whole thing is constantly swimming dangerously close to the dreaded Disney Channel territory. Just check out the music itself, it almost sounds like the Jonas Brothers' lost tapes. Tough to imagine an aspiring metal artist would want to be in a 1000-mile radius of this band, but that's just one of the many weird things we just have to suck up. And of course there are also subplots about love interests, there's just no possible way to avoid that in this kind of movie. They slow the movie down more than anything, which makes it rather boring to boot. This movie is very similar to ""School of Rock"", but somehow it's also lots worse."
"matches81","5","2","5","8 July 2009"," Mediocre
","Basically, ""The Rocker"" is a 100% clich√© sports / music movie. The hero falls flat on his face, then you have the ""training phase"". When he's back on his feet on the way up, there's a ""twist"" putting him down and quickly after that comes the happy end. Nothing new, nothing unexpected here. Added into the mix is quite a bit of comedy, which works fine. I had some good laughs and some smiles during the film. The two things annoying about the file for me were: <br/><br/>a) the band seen during the vast majority of the film is not exactly what I expected seeing in a film called ""The Rocker"". The songs aren't bad, but they just don't rock. Real letdown for me. <br/><br/>b) I play drums and I know quite a few drummers and it got on my nerves that, obviously, nobody found the time to tell Rainn Wilson how to hold drum sticks. He does an admirable job of hitting roughly the right things on the drum set at the right time, but... well, I could just tell he's not a drummer and that he's faking, somewhat ruining the ""illusion"". He took the time to seemingly learn one or two beats and to learn when to hit what during some of the more prominent breaks in the songs seen in the movie, but nobody told him how to hold the sticks. I just don't get that.<br/><br/>Anyhow... nice, fairly enjoyable movie overall. If you have the choice between School of Rock and this one, I'd pick School of Rock, especially if you haven't seen it yet. Same structure, better music, more / better gags and the kids know what they're doing."
"gryffindor249","7","2","5","27 August 2008"," A Nice Sleeper
","I have a funny feeling this flick will get wider exposure on DVD and become a cult hit, though it deserved much more than being dumped into theatres in late August with little fanfare and minimal box office. It's one of those movies that make you go, ""Why didn't this do well when it was in the theatre?"" A collection of Hollywood's finest B-List But Much More Talented Than The A-List Actors pull off a funny yet sad portrait of the Rock 'n Roll life and dashed dreams. So many have commented that this seemed like a rejected Jack Black vehicle; but thank god for Rainn Wilson, who manages to create so many distinct characters in various projects from one quirky personality-whereas Jack Black is always Jack Black."
"goldwriting","7","2","5","21 August 2008"," Comedy Rhythms with Heart
","This summer we have seen everything in the realm of comedy from forty-year-old children and weed fueled action heroes to bumbling super spies and blackfaced primadonnas. It has truly been the summer of high concept, but the audiences are just about ripe for something solid, something familiar and something just under the radar. Who knew it would come in the form of Dwight from The Office? The Rocker follows the dream which never quite came true for our main character, Fish. He was the drummer in a band, but in order to rocket their career to unheard of levels, they had to drop him. Drop they did, and Fish dwindles into obscurity and ambivalence towards life itself. Twenty years later the universe smiles on him once more and he gets the chance to play drums in his nephew's band. Through a series of pop culture twists and turns the band ends up becoming an overnight sensation and Fish runs wild through the fields of his waking dreams, while learning the lessons of what it really takes to be the member of a band, not a one man show. Of course, he is not the only one learning lessons, but he's the main dude on the poster, you know how it goes.<br/><br/>Getting myself comfy in the cushioned theater chair, I was fully expecting a slapstick style, overgrown childhood movie with Rainn Wilson taking charge of the blundering and buffoonery, but what flickered on the screen in front of me was much more than prop jokes and prat falls. The Rocker sneaks by the chuckles and laughter and weasels into your heart with a subtly touching story and some really soft moments. Rainn does get hit by numerous objects and suffers more than his share of bodily harm, but he also never wavers from believing his dream is right and true, not some childhood fantasy. The more subtle comedic moments are left to Josh Gad, who plays his socially awkward nephew/keyboard player. Josh delivers more than a few times and his style felt oddly akin to Dan Fogler ala Balls of Fury, a kind of straight line delivery for a ludicrous line on the page. Rounding out the bandmates are Emma Stone and Teddy Geiger. Emma personifies the ""i-hate-everyone-but-the-people-in-this-band"" chick, while Teddy has no problem with his sensitive, soulful lead singer persona. For those who don't already know, this is a touch into the area of typecasting since Teddy Geiger already has a wildly popular album called Underage Thinking and he lent his pop music talents to almost all the original music in the movie. Since they were able to write songs from the characters perspective and not just layer in current pop tracks, The Rocker tips gently into the genre of musical, because the songs actually investigate the emotional state of the characters and move the story along. Also, while Teddy is selling movie tickets and soundtracks, Emma Stone is doing what few actors, especially at the young age of twenty, get to do; open two movies in the same week! The Rocker beat it to the punch, but The House Bunny opens this coming Friday and Emma co-stars in that alongside and Anna Faris and Rumor Willis. It's a one-two punch for the young ing√©nue who last charmed people as the girl of Seth's dreams in Superbad.<br/><br/>Lending a hand to the laugh level were a number of cameos and side characters. Jason Sudeikis from SNL drops by to play the slimiest of record label agents in recent movie history. There are moments you want to punch him, but then you wonder what might get on your hands and if it would wash off later. Christina Applegate plays Teddy Geiger's mom and tries to balance out the adult-to-child ratio in the mix. She does a decent job and has some truly biting lines (rebutting being called a MILF by replying with calling the man a PILS, you'll have to see it to get the definition, but I think my best friend will be using it for the rest of her life). Demetri Martin also shows up as the epitome of pretentious, film school drop out, ultra hipster music video directors and it gave me a medium level of anxiety just imagining being on a set with a character like that.<br/><br/>This was honestly the last movie I had any inkling would stir any feelings beyond a bubbling chuckle in my belly, but there is a sweetness to the story and an honesty to the message. It all boils down to follow your dreams, no matter the cost. If that message is spoken faithfully, no matter what story you wrap it in, there will be some people in that audience walking out a little lighter in their step, just itching to get home and pull out their old hobbies, guitars, etc. Don't get me wrong, this is no Rocky, I doubt many people will suddenly become rock stars after seeing this, but they might just get a tiny bit of inspiration from the best place possible; somewhere unexpected.<br/><br/>Recommendation: I was completely surprised by it, but I'm a sucker for a sweet story. Some good comedic moments, but they are outweighed and outnumbered by the more heartfelt ones. If you're looking for down-and-out comedy, this might no be crude enough for you. Yet, if you want something simple, with a nice rhythm, this could be the right beat for your Saturday afternoon.<br/><br/>p.s. Christina Applegate also holds one of the best honors ever, being mentioned in the P.M. Dawn song, Set Adrift on Memory Bliss. Let's be honest, where can you possibly go from there?"

","I went to see this with my 10 year old son, and my friends 10 year old son, 8 year old daughter, and 6 year old daughter. There was some crude humor and a few sexual references, but overall not too bad. A light PG-13 I would say. As for the movie, I laughed throughout. It moved along quickly and was probably one of the best comedies I've seen in awhile. Rainn Wilson is great and the opening sequences are hysterical. The supporting cast is all great from the teenagers in the movie to Cristina Applegate as one of the mom's as well as Jane Lynch as one of the other moms. I don't think the kids got most of the jokes (thankfully in some cases)but all three adults that went enjoyed it and would recommend it. The music was really good. It's a nice little gem."
"Ramascreen","Null","2","5","20 July 2008"," Never ask permission to Rock!
","I've always wanted the movie School of Rock 2 but I never expected it to appear in this form. THE ROCKER isn't original but it is entertaining. It's another story of a middle aged man who wants to feel young again, who's been wanting a second chance because¬Ö he didn't get it the first time around but then he learns something valuable along the way. THE ROCKER has enough humor to make you laugh and leave you smiling at the end of the movie. Look at your rear view mirrors, comedy movie stars everywhere because Rainn Wilson is drawing near and he's catching up.<br/><br/>It is a funny movie. Don't get your hopes up and don't have low expectations either, because one way or another, you're going to end up liking this movie. The jokes aren't that raunchy but some are in the borderline. Some scenes are cute and sweet and will make some audiences go 'Aww'. The self-realization moments are not cheesy or too sentimental. I'm glad the movie is still determined to stay cool and rock n' roll throughout the whole thing.<br/><br/>Here you can definitely see the drastic difference from what the 80s thought was awesome and what the present time thinks is awesome as far as music, hairstyle, and clothing go. It's about knowing when to grow up but at the same time knowing not to let go some things that make your spirit feel alive. It's about what it means to be in a band and have each other's back. And it's about appreciating oneself without letting what others say mess with your heads and what it means to Rock! All that and more already covered in Jack Black's School of Rock but instead of kids,¬Ö this time it's geared toward teens.<br/><br/>I like how this movie promotes Rock n Roll Hall of Fame museum in Cleveland, Ohio. It sure receives some publicity from this movie. Despite the fact that I've been to Ohio twice in my whole life, I have yet to visit the site. It will be my my purpose for living.<br/><br/>I just wanna emphasize that THE ROCKER wouldn't have been what it is without Rainn Wilson's excellent performance. His charm and persona is what gives this movie its soul. His comedic timing is as on the target as his ability to endure slapstick physical humor and to change moods and expressions from a careless immature adult into a compassionate, and responsible team player. Maybe Will Ferrell could also do the gig but I don't think he would as good a job."
"MLDinTN","5","2","6","16 August 2009"," average film, decent music
","This movie was OK. It's probably more for the teen crowd. I thought the original songs were OK. I think the actors that played Curtis and Amelia have potential. The character Rainn Wilson plays made me think of one thing ""Jack Black"". I mean the role of Fish was perfect for him, but I guess he wouldn't do it, so Wilson took the role.<br/><br/>The best parts were when it showed Vesvious starting out. Having Fish chase the van was just creepy and using the drum sticks to punch holes in the roof. You got to love the 80s look with the hair and black eyeliner. Then at the end, they all have British accents.<br/><br/>Of course, you have to look past the timeline in order to buy into this film. In the movie, ADD goes from you tube to having a number one album from touring a couple of midwestern states in like 3 months. It's a comedy, so get over it.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you like the music in this, then you should like the movie. It's nothing earth shattering, but I thought it was 90 minutes of decent entertainment."
"Quinoa1984","5","2","6","20 June 2009"," Rainn Wilson is funny, but it can't elevate slight material
","The Rocker is content to be in its place, and I was content that it was, more or less. Less because it could have been something very funny, maybe on a level of smart rocker comedy like School of Rock (there's probably been numerous comparisons, but it ends with it being about a 30-something rocker teaching the ""kids"" how to do it right), and would have perhaps peaked my interest to see it in the theater. But nothing from the trailers or the commercials made it appear to be much more than it looked: bland PG-13 stuff with some occasional prat-falls and Rainn Wilson used like a $10 hooker. As it turns out, expectations were met: it's perfectly suitable as a rental, but it shouldn't be something you feel sorry you missed. And, sadder still, it was the right choice to release it in one of those lesser release periods for movies: the ass-end of summer, so to speak.<br/><br/>Oh sure, Rainn Wilson tries, and is funny throughout the movie as ""Fish"", a once-drummer for Vesuvius, a heavy-metal bank that kicked him out so they could make it huge with a record company that insisted a family member replace him. After 20 years Fish's nephew comes to the now cranky old-school rocker and asks him to play the prom with his band, A.D.D. (not, not ADD, Attention Deficit Disorder- this brings a chuckle, but only one). It's a bust gig, but the idea of him as drummer sticks around, and soon it turns into, well, one of ""those"" rock and roll movies, where it's not about the music so much as it's about the sort of 'rise-and-fall' story we've seen often: big record deal spear-headed by a one-dimensional a-hole (Will Arnett) and lots of fame and glory, but then the downside of ego and, in this case, a confrontation Fish has to make with his past demons of a former band.<br/><br/>Wilson's sense of comic timing is impeccable, even when not a whole lot is going on. It's kind of sad seeing him try so hard, and sometime succeed, with material that either tries to be funny too much (again, physical or gross-out gags of the PG-13 variety) or not quite enough ('the naked drummer' good was amusing, but then the writers just left it behind without taking it a step further- a similar flop comparable to the much touted nudity scene in Forgetting Sarah Marhsall). Certain lines are memorable ("" A lot of elevators play Celine Dion - that doesn't make it right""), and one or two scenes do stick out (the funniest without Wilson is by far Dimitri Martin's bit part as a pretentious music video maestro with a bolex), but, again, too many fall flat or are over-played or whatever. It's as if the filmmakers- and I include co-screenwriter Wallace Wolodarsky, usually a dependable writer from the Simpsons- were content in the knowledge that they were making at best an amusing B-movie and at worst forgettable fluff.<br/><br/>This is best evidenced in the fact that a) when there is music from A.D.D. it's middling pop stuff with maybe the one song ""Not Bitter"" being above average, and b) a misuse of a comic talent like Will Arnett, who seems to somehow suck the comic life out of any scene he's in - I can't tell whether it's his fault or the director for not letting him go off and improv or maybe not get enough, or maybe both, but either way he's in direct contrast with Wilson, who goes all out and is his usual fun Rainn Wilson self. The Rocker is what you've heard: not terrible, nothing great, a decent little Saturday afternoon potato-couch flick that will only remind you how you could be watching any given episode of the Office or Arrested Development instead."

This was really Rainn Wilson's first big gig in a movie, mostly you see him playing Dwight on the sitcom 'The Office'.

Teddy Geiger's performance wasn't the best, it wasn't terrible, he's not an actor he's a singer but he did good nonetheless.

I especially liked one scene when he staged his comeback after a 20 year absence from the music industry. While practising with his new band and trying to understand how a web cam works he was sitting in his garage buck naked and mucking around with the web cam but he had no clue his drum sequence while being buck naked was going viral.<br/><br/>Now he meets up with his old rock band who abandoned him 20 years earlier for their own fame and fortune. His old band members include SNL alumni Will Arnett,and Fred Armisen, and a wild looking Bradley Cooper. You just know that at some time in the movie there would have to be a showdown between Rainn Wilson's former band who are now rock legends and Rainn's new band who have a great songwriter and lead singer in Teddy Geiger. Teddy Geiger's road trip mom is played admirably by Christina Applegate.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of some of Adam Sandler's similar type movies. A story line with a bit of romance (the romantic interest played sincerely by Christina Applegate) the sad sack (Rainn Wilson) and the blossoming friendship between two of his new band mates, Emma Stone and Teddy Geiger.<br/><br/>The movie is very light, and worth a watch, but it is nothing memorable either."

","it must be difficult to envisage an aging ex rocker that doesn't mirror the character that is jack black in school of rock, but if you were intending to make a new movie that had a lead character who was in a similar situation and head space to Jack Black's character surely you'd go way out of your way to make SURE you didn't do anything that vaguely resembled Mr Black. That hasn't happened here unfortunately so one must assume that making an original movie was not high on the list of priorities for these guys. Its not a bad movie at all but it's hard to watch it without being reminded of Jack Black doing similar things in his movies, and better too."
"moviemaniac008","8","2","7","14 September 2008"," A nice summer comedy
","The Rocker is not the best movie I have seen, however, it is a nice summer comedy. The plot revolves around Fish (Rainn Wilson), a drummer for the hip rock band Vesuvious (I think it's the way it's spelled). However, Fish gets kicked out by his own band, for a promotion. Fish stops his musical career and becomes a nobody, until he finds out that his nephew and his friends have their own band, and that their drummer is grounded for bringing hash-brownies to school. Fish tries out for the band, who after a while, accept him, which brings a lot of misadventures along the way.<br/><br/>The acting was pretty good. Rainn Wilson, an actor I hardly knew, could eventually be one of the future comedy superstar, such as Seth Rogen or Will Ferrell. He just has to find better contracts. The young actors were pretty good, however I need to see more out of them. Example: Just because Emma Stone was good (and beautiful) in this movie doesn't mean I will pay to see The House Bunny. I know that Teddy Geiger is a singer, but unfortunately, I don't like his music. On the other hand, if he could become more of an actor and less of a singer, I would enjoy him a lot more. I also liked A.D.D's music, it would be so awesome if the actors could have been a real band.<br/><br/>But the movie has it's flaws. One of the movie's biggest flaws are the scenes that are extended with unnecessary dialogue, but again, it seems that every single movie has this flaw. But on the other hand, the movie's humor makes you forget about it and spend a nice hour and thirty. A nice summer comedy, I recommend it for a lot of people, if it's still in theaters where you live, spending a little bit of money to see this movie won't kill you."

","""The Rocker"" doesn't quite fit the mold of the indies I generally see and review. It's distributed by 20th Century Fox or, more specifically, Fox Atomic -- the new youth-oriented distribution arm created by this Hollywood studio to tap into the MySpace market (literally). In fact, the social networking site holds a prominent place in the film as well as in its marketing -- MySpace and Fox are both owned by Rupert Murdoch. That said, having spent most of my adult life in the music industry, with it still being my first love, any film with rock & roll at its core is of special interest to me.<br/><br/>Robert 'Fish"" Fishman (Rainn Wilson), drummer for 80s big-hair rock group Vesuvius, is unceremoniously kicked out of the band just as they're about to begin their volcanic rise to fame and immortality. This forces Fish to put his dreams on the shelf. Enter his nephew Matt (Josh Gadd) who, 20 years later, is in need of a drummer for ADD, the band he's formed with classmates Amelia (Emma Stone) and Curtis (Teddy Geiger). And so begins Fish's journey to redeem himself, avenge his wrong, and fulfill his dream.<br/><br/>""The Rocker"" is schizophrenic. Director Peter Cattaneo (""The Full Monty"") made two movies here. One stars Rainn Wilson channeling Jack Black and is a comedy heavy with farce and sight gags. His dialogue is a nonstop jokefest and the audience loved it. The other is an ""Almost Famous""/""That Thing You Do"" drama about a high school band's rise to fame, starring Teddy Geiger as their frontman. He hardly has one funny line in the script, nor do several other bandmates and family members. And that was fine by me. That movie was story- and character-driven with poignancy and heart.<br/><br/>I loved the ADD story (as in Attention Deficit Disorder, which might describe this movie's script). As a singer-turned-actor, Geiger carried that film on his shoulders with heart and soul. Robert ""Fish"" Fishman's (Rainn Wilson) story is a cute skit that felt shoehorned into an otherwise authentic musical biopic. I get the sense that co-writers Maya Forbes (""The Larry Sanders Show"") and Wally Wolodarsky (""The Simpsons"") submitted two separate scripts and the producers couldn't decide which one to go with, so they flipped 'em like a deck of cards and played the hand that came up.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the best thing about ""The Rocker"" is, indeed, the music. While the soundtrack does include your standard classic 80s rock and hair band tunes (Kiss, Foreigner) it's the original music which made this movie work for me. Just as one could listen to ""That Thing You Do"" over and over and over (which was exactly what writer/director Tom Hanks was aiming for in his film of the same name), the songs by Chad Fischer are good enough that I could have closed my eyes and still enjoyed the movie. Not only that, but the ""star"" of the film, Teddy Geiger, (Rainn Wilson aside) is a bonafide singer/songwriter who actually does do all the singing himself. As Wilson pointed out in the Q&A following the screening I attended, having authentic music performed by a real band was a priority, and Fischer's songs along with Geiger's artistry fit the bill.<br/><br/>Take out Fischer's original soundtrack and Geiger's performance and what's left is a tolerable 90 minute film that I wouldn't even be writing about right now. As it is, at one hour forty-two minutes, I couldn't wait for the credits to roll so I could go out and buy the soundtrack."

At least, that is, until he joins his nephew's band and hits the road on his own quest for rock immortality.<br/><br/>The cast is decent but suggests that a low budget forced the film-makers to settle for cheap substitutes. Rainn Wilson is ideally suited to his role but besides him there's very little worth remarking on in terms of acting.<br/><br/>The story is hackneyed at times but overall it's pretty entertaining. The screenplay has some decent jokes but there are also a few misfires to go along with them. There's not much here that's truly clever or original but that doesn't mean that it isn't enjoyable.<br/><br/>The direction is up to par but not particularly notable in any way. The original music is fairly catchy and fits the fictional acts well.

","Robert ""Fish"" Fishman is the drummer for heavy metal band Vesuvius. They are offered a lucrative record deal, but only on condition that they dump Fish and replace him with the record label head's nephew. Pete Best cameos, to make sure that we don't miss the point. 20 years later, Vesuvius has gone from strength to strength while Fish has drifted through a series of dead end jobs, filled with bitterness, and ending up sleeping on an inflatable mattress in his sister's loft. Then his nephew Matt, keyboard player in high school band ADD, asks him to substitute for their drummer, so he gets behind a kit for the first time in 20 years. Various mishaps lead to the band having to rehearse over an internet link. Fish, by this time, is reduced to living in an overheated basement, and the resulting video of the nude drummer becomes immensely popular on Youtube, leading to a record contract and tour, which culminates when ADD is invited to open at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on the occasion of Vesuvius' induction.<br/><br/>The joke here is that the young band members are all vastly more adult than Fish, who remains resolutely adolescent in his approach to everything.<br/><br/>I liked this film a lot. It would have been easy for it to have embraced the current tendency for humour to lean towards smut, scatology, drugs and bad language: it is greatly to the movie's credit that it remains pretty much (though not totally) smut-free, devoid of bad language, yet still very funny. Rainn Wilson, as Fish, deserves kudos here for delivering a performance which embraces childish idiocy, slapstick, heart and sentiment, all wrapped up in a genuine likability.<br/><br/>Having said that, none of the characters here are fundamentally unpleasant - the worst they (the Vesuvius members and record company people) can be accused of is shallowness and disloyalty. The young band members are fleshed out beyond ciphers and all play well, and Christina Applegate as the mother of one of the members (and looking as good as she's ever looked) teaches Fish the valuable lesson that you can embrace adult responsibility without ever letting go of your inner rocker. Even the secondary characters (Fish's rock-star wannabe brother-in-law) have their moments.<br/><br/>This movie isn't a great work of art, but it is a solid, entertaining, and fairly heart-warming comedy."

","""Opportunity rocks""<br/><br/>The Office star Rainn Wilson portrays a drummer named ""Fish,"" who gets a second shot at fame 20 years after getting kicked out of his band on the very night they signed the record contract that made them stars. Fish has spent the past two decades languishing at soul-crushing day jobs while his old bandmates became legends, continuing to grace magazine covers and dominate the radio. He might just get another chance at musical success, however, when his teenage cousin invites him to drum for his high school garage band, and they end up catching the ear of record executives. Now, Fish is determined to live the hedonistic rock & roll lifestyle he missed out on 20 years ago, but his new bandmates don't appreciate his hard partying -- and neither do his middle-aged knees. This Fox Atomic comedy co-stars Christina Applegate. Shawn Levy (Night at the Museum) and Tom McNulty co-produced the feature, which was penned by Wallace Wolodarsky and Maya Forbes, and directed by Peter Cattaneo (Opal Dream). <br/><br/>Review I find The Rocker highly amusing, sue me. While its no School of Rock and Rainn Wilson is in no way in the league of a God that is Jack Black, The Rocker finds its way to audiences with its rockin soundtrack and the comedic power of one Rainn Wilson, who also plays one of the most lovable TV character ever, The Office's Dwight Schrute.<br/><br/>The gags and the jokes might seem out of line at some point, but quickly recovers as Rainn Wilson's hilarious antics make up for it for the whole duration of the movie. He's fast becoming one of my favorite comedian out there. Although Rainn Wilson's attempt to promote the movie proved to be futile, Jenna Fischer being locked up in the back of his Firebird so that you will watch the movie, and quite frankly it didn't fare well in the box office which I found rather odd because the movie is a comedy. This is the kind of movie that people will actually spend their money on and just have a good time watching it, they put Beverly Hills Chihuahua in the top spot for two straight weeks and this hilarious romp didn't even make it to two weeks. Hysterical."

Sucks and ups that's all. And maybe because of it I can I agree with one our critics: this movie has a long time effect on your soul and brain.

While Maya Forbes' and Wallace Wolardarsky's screenplay based on Ryan Jaffe's story is uneven to say the least, the film itself has its charms namely in its star's delusional courage and pluck to carry the weight of the unwieldy gimmick of a storyline which actually is sweet (i.e. chase your dreams by achieving your goals, an old chestnut sure, but it works with gumption here).

My favorite aspect of the script wasn't the most obvious -- but was the depiction of a teen band, beginning to be successful, that did NOT have young band members that were drinking, drugging and sexing.

The fact that it is being compared to School of Rock goes aways to describing how entertaining this film is.<br/><br/>Rainn Wilson plays a perfect over-the-top wannabe Rockstar who should've made it big but never did. He is awesome on The Office and I was very happy to see him deliver so huge in his first starring role.

In my opinion, one of the potential downfalls of this kind of comedy, with an actor such as Rainn Wilson, is mugging (being overly cute for the camera, figuratively winking at the audience, etc.). To be kind, I won't mention examples of fatal cutesiness in other actors--- but you know what I mean. The Rocker avoided all of that, and came across as honest and friendly.<br/><br/>What was refreshing, and very enjoyable here, was the heart in the movie. It has a sweetness and an authenticity I really enjoyed. Solid story, believable plot, and it is populated by characters who actually make choices, learn, and grow.

","If you read my other reviews, I tell the overview plot of the movie in a few sentences. Robert Fish (Rainn Wilson) would be booted out of a band that would be extremely successful, Vesuvius due to politics. <br/><br/>Vesuvius would continue to be popular for over 20 years. Fish is recruited by his nephew Matty (Josh Gad) in need of a drummer for his own band. Fish, tired of living life as a couch potato accepts the offer and tries to take the limelight and be as successful as Vesuvius.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the movie overall is that it's EXTREMELY predictable. <br/><br/>An unnecessary scene of drinking at a bar after a gig? Check. Emma Stone in the movie only there to act as eye candy to the audience? Check. You can essentially write the script in it yourself. <br/><br/>Another issue is that character development is really only given to Rainn Wilson and nobody else. Near the end of the movie, the band Matty formed (A.D.D) plays as an opening gig for Vesuvius and there's NO chemistry given between Rainn Wilson and his former band mates and if they should let the past be behind them or not but, no.<br/><br/>There's no apologizes given for the two former band mates. And there's no real character development for the rest of the A.D.D. band that would make you care for why they formed a band in the first place (minus Fish)<br/><br/>The ending of the movie comes with A.D.D. stealing an encore presentation from Vesuvius after they were caught lip syncing and the movie ends in bittersweet fashion. <br/><br/>I didn't laugh once in the movie, but that's probably because Rock Band and Myspace (some of the gags in this movie) are not even relevant anymore in 2015.<br/><br/>Not a very good movie. I only recommend you check it out if you are musically inclined."
"phubbs","5","0","1","27 July 2015"," The Rocker
","I believe this was Rainn Wilson's first leading role in his own movie, the first time a movie revolved around his character. Unfortunately the movie isn't exactly an original concept, some might say it kinda rips-off the 2003 movie 'School of Rock' to a degree, maybe even touching on the Brit flick 'Still Crazy' here and there.<br/><br/>The plot centres around the fictional drummer Robert Fishman (Wilson) of the heavy metal rock band Vesuvius. Back in the 80's this band are on the verge of hitting the big time with their heavy metal/glam rock songs and outrageous onstage antics. Alas the record company that wants to sign them sets an ultimatum, they must drop their drummer Fishman...and replace him with the record companies nephew. Eventually the band agree and Fishman is out. We follow Fishman years down the line, his life has crumbled, he loses his job, his girlfriend and he is forced to move in with his sister. But it is here, with his sisters family, he finds a lifeline in his nephews high school rock band.<br/><br/>So yes, it is very much like 'School of Rock', the main difference of course being this is based around teenagers instead of young kids. Does that make the film any better? well sort of I guess, its not exactly a riveting tale of originality as said. Bottom line the film survives purely because of Wilson and his goofiness along with his non- Hollywood looks. This is Rainn's appeal, the guy is not good looking, he is not fit or ripped in any way and he's not a ladies man type. This guy is just a regular looking bloke, the kind of guy you would actually find serving you in a retail park electronics store. Its this that makes Wilson likable as the everyman up against it, he uses his, dare I say, pug-ugly looks and out of shape physique to great effect. Indeed in this film we see his flabby toneless torso quite often, and its admittedly amusing, it works (I especially liked the brief moment at the start where he hurls his sweat soaked vest into the crowd, and it slaps some poor fan across the face).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are made up of stereotypical teens that fit the stereotypical mould. You have the good looking male lead singer that has all the girls swooning over him, yet he's somehow not fulfilled. The fat, curly haired, awkward kid who doesn't really fit in, but towards the end totally gets into it and snatches a hot girl way out of his league. And finally you have Emma Stone who obviously plays the cute female band member who secretly has the hots for the good looking male lead singer (guess what happens in the end). The supposedly funny bit is the fact they hire Fishman as their drummer, a man in his forties who thinks he's still a young rocker and likes to live the dream, real life responsibilities aside. Oh and their manager is a creepy untrustworthy cad...so again, not much originality.<br/><br/>Much of the bands tomfoolery is played out through Wilson's Fishman character and it is slightly amusing as said, but it grows old very quickly. The whole aspect of his life going through a downhill spiral of rejection after losing Vesuvius is completely predictable and dull frankly. The sequences where he goes all wild and crazy in true rock n roll fashion are also slightly amusing but again so obvious, you just know at some point he'll trash a hotel room. The romance angle between Stone and the good looking lead singer is hammy as hell as is Josh Gad's fat kid character...hell its all clich√©d to the max. <br/><br/>This is the films problem, there is nothing here you haven't really seen before, every plot angle, every character development, the predictable face to face reunion with Vesuvius and their ultimate downfall in the concert finale etc...Its not exactly terrible stuff, its just completely average and actually kinda boring. THE only reason to watch this movie is for the sporadic moments of lunacy from Wilson, as in his other movie 'Super', he does show he can actually act and deliver emotion well. Other than that its a total by the numbers comedy. Heck even the films promotion efforts were similar to that Jack Black comedy I mentioned earlier. The main difference being that movie actually felt more like a homage to rock despite being a kids flick, you just don't get that with this movie.<br/><br/>5/10"

","The Rocker (2008): Dir: Peter Cattaneo / Cast: Rainn Wilson, Christina Applegate, Teddy Geiger, Emma Stone, Josh Gad: Rock and roll comedy about high energy, which is something the screenplay doesn't possess much of. After twenty years Rainn Wilson is still bitter over the rejection of a band that found fame. When he accepts an offer to drum in his nephew's band it leads to record deals, videos, tours, and serious facts. From director Peter Cattaneo with a decent setup and rewarding ending. This is all a payoff to the talent of Wilson who plays off his youth unaware of physical limitations. Unfortunately this is a major setback for Cattaneo whose previous film The Full Monty was far more innovative and received greater acclaim. While Rainn carries the film Christina Applegate as a mother is wasted. Her prime function is to lecture him while leaving viewers with the obvious belief that she actually likes him. Teddy Geiger plays that sour faced band member who needs to be told that he has talent before he arrives where viewers already were an hour ago. Emma Stone plays a female band member and that is pretty much the height of her involvement. For a superior film I recommend the far superior and funnier This is Spinal Tap. The film settles for B movie appeal as oppose to examining the lifestyles therefore it doesn't rock as hard as it should. Score: 2 ¬Ω / 10"
"Maniac-9","5","0","2","15 March 2012"," The Rocker, more like The Emoer
","I get the idea that the studios after the success of The School of Rock movie wanted to make their own version of a Rock N' Roll themed movie, but they obviously struck out here. First of all the band they chose to be the star of the movie is an Emo style band and they make the villainous evil popular band that you're supposed to hate a hard rock band. I'm sorry but if you go to a rock concert anywhere and you have the choice to listening to either an emo band play or a hard rock band the harder band is going to win out every time. And you can tell that the studio who greenlit this was hoping to have Jack Black play the lead role but when he turned them down they decided to go with Rainn Wilson instead. I like Wilson as Dwight Schrute but it's kind of hard to buy him as a rock n' roll musician."
"RainDogJr","Null","0","1","14 August 2011"," 211 songs? ""Wow, that's like 500 albums""
","There's a scene in Peter Cattaneo's THE ROCKER in which the main character (Rainn Wilson's sort of version of ""rocker Jack Black"", Robert Fishman aka Fish) correctly puts the, as he call it, ""drive test"" as a true indicator if a song does or does not work. I mean, who doesn't love to drive with a badass tune playing in the car? Who doesn't love to drive to some great The Doors album? Or to some killer Mot√∂rhead tunes and feel, like Fish says, ""on top of the world""? Here Fish is out there driving together with one of his band-mates (Teddy Geiger's character Curtis). They will test a song Curtis wrote. For them the song does work, does rock, and does make you feel like you're sitting on top of the world. But if a movie with as a title like THE ROCKER says that a song like the one Curtis wrote totally rocks, something is pretty darn wrong. Nobody who truly loves rock music will drive to that song and f****** rock! Probably in every single review of this movie we have a comparison with Richard Linklater's THE SCHOOL OF ROCK. If you still wonder why, well I just say to you that Wilson's character is a frustrated rocker who now will find a new chance with a band of kids. Hell, it actually begins in the EXACT same way (with the main character being kicked out of a band) and ends in the¬Ö well enough with the spoilers. To finish my ""drive test"" point, here a real problem is that the kids don't rock (they are not really *kids* though, but adolescents). The music is closer to the Jonas Brothers than to The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Cream, AC/DC, or any of the other great rock bands that THE SCHOOL OF ROCK paid homage to. And certainly that homage thing was one of the reasons why that 2003 Linklater movie was a real blast. Yes, there's only one true rocker here, and Wilson as Fish really is good, darn good fun (just read again Fish's dialog I put as the summary!), but in the end he just can't help the *just plain unmemorable* rest of the movie. Also, in the end everyone sort of forgot that Fish was a real rocker, you know, he *has* to be around a so-so cast of kids, damn Jane Lynch playing the un-cool serious character (his husband was funny, though), enough said. A mixed bag, the kid of thing that makes you say, in the most convinced way, the ""I will not watch this again""."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","1","11 August 2011"," Predictably Rocking The Way Back To The Top
","While it starts off hilariously with some promise, Peter Cattaneo's 'The Rocker' quickly treads on a predictable path and the end result is a generic comedy about a rockstar's fall from grace and then climbing back up. The story lacks development and the pacing is uneven. It starts off with a decent pace and then moves very fast and then slows down in the latter portion. That is not to say that this isn't an enjoyable watch. Thanks, mainly to the cast, especially Rainn Wilson, that most of the humour works. It was also a relief that Cattaneo and the writers didn't rely too much on toilet humour. Rainn Wilson is terrific in his role and he easily carries the film. However, comedic talents like Christina Applegate and Jane Lynch are wasted. The younger cast is impressive despite the lack of development in their characters. While Teddy Geiger and Josh Gad turn in sincere performances, Emma Stone turns out to be the outstanding one of the lot as she continues to prove why she is among the best of the young lot. The songs are forgettable. Overall, it's not a great film but funny enough, thanks to Wilson, to draw some laughter."
"Naughtia_Nah","8","0","1","21 June 2011"," There's something about this movie that made me like it a lot
","I had a blast watching this movie, I thought it was extremely funny and very entertaining. <br/><br/>The main character played by Rainn Wilson was the best thing about this movie. Of course I've seen this kind of stories a million times in other movies but there just was something about this movie that made me like it more than the other ones, I guess I'm feeling more sympathy for the often misunderstood characters. Other than that I think that it's always entertaining to watch an awkward person going by his/her strange existence. This is probably one of my favorite comedy movies this year, it's definitely one to watch."
"neilucifer","10","0","1","8 May 2011"," a movie to watch again and again
","This movie doesn't have many things, no dazzling cinematography, or directing, acting is funny when necessary and okay everywhere else. but what is has is wonderful dialogue, quite a lot of heart, Rainn Wilson and Emma Stone. The dialogues are just excellent, nothing dramatic, but funny and won't sound out of place if you use it everyday. Its kinda hard to explain the 'heart' part, People tell me 'Shawshank redemption' got a lot of heart but I found it a big bore, like my grandpa telling me what to do and what not to. An aging ex rocker trying to find his solace drumming for a newbie band; I find that heart warming. Rainn Wilson really performed, and this was the first time I saw Emma Stone; it was very hard not to fall for her when she smiled! Put them all together, and you get a movie to watch time and time again. i did so. at least 5 or 6 times. I watched 'ulysses gaze' twice, and promptly started snoring within 15 minutes after 'weirckmeister harmonies' started. go figure."
"stonemountainproductions","5","0","1","28 May 2009"," Dwight vs. the Fish
","The only reason I decided to see this film was because I love Rainn Wilson's character, ""Dwight"" on the office. Unfortunately, as the character Fish, he didn't make me laugh at all in this film. I was ready to turn the film off after the opening sequence, but I stuck it out because nothing else was on. It did get better, but not much better. I kept picturing Jack Black and how perfect he would be for the lead role instead of Rainn. Sometimes Rainn reminded me of Jack. If you saw the film then you would know what I mean. The screenplay was a mess. I wanted to shoot the film makers for putting certain scenes in the film, especially the opening sequence. One of the worst scenes to open a film. I'll continue to just stick with Dwight for now."

","""Ooh, look out, you rock and rollers! Pretty soon now you're gonna get older."" --David Bowie, Changes. <br/><br/>Even though THE ROCKER is about a middle-aged rock drummer who sees a second stab at fame with his young nephew's band, it is mostly for nerds who need to get laid by pretending to be rock stars. <br/><br/>Rainn Wilson, fresh from his stint on Steve Carell's inferior-to-Gervais's THE OFFICE, does a bang-up job as drummer Robert ""Fish"" Fishman, whose 70s hair-band, Vesuvius, cracked superstardom soon after they kicked Fish out of the band. The opening scene of Fish being sacked is unnaturally funny (featuring Fred Armisen - ""Obama"" on Saturday Night Live - as the bassist in Vesuvius), its over-the-top lunacy promising a film that laughs in the face of arena rock and loogies on the Aquanetted hair of fame. <br/><br/>Instead, THE ROCKER turns down the volume as if the neighbors are complaining. <br/><br/>Twenty years after his sacking, Fish is jobless, living in his sister's attic (near Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame), watching bitterly as Vesuvius is on everyone's playlist with yet another chart-topping album. <br/><br/>Fish finds an outlet for his hair-metal flamboyance and inappropriate nakedness in his nephew's band, A.D.D. - who ask him to drum for them out of desperation only to find their boring GenX style does not quite mesh with Fish's energy and excitability.<br/><br/>A.D.D., led by Fish's nephew, dork keyboardist Matt (Josh Gad), is a study in everything wrong with kids today in bands, i.e. they don't have a clue. (Did I just say, ""kids today""? How old must I be to say that with impunity?) And it hurts my skull how it is so obvious the film-makers (director Peter Cattaneo and writers, Maya Forbes, Wallace Wolodarsky and Ryan Jaffe) don't have a clue on how to make these youngsters seem like they have a clue. Without turning on PlayStation 3. <br/><br/>Keep BBRRETENDING, kids - wait until you get onstage and find out you can't watch a TV screen and press buttons to make music; wait until you realize you have to learn songs and practice to make a band go; wait until there's a crowd staring blankly at you and you have to ad-lib something off the top of your head; wait until you put your mouth to a mic attached to a real P.A. and it picks up every breath, every subtle missed note, every nuance, every pop and sssibilance sibilanccce...<br/><br/>At least the movie represents that it's hard to get a gig. Because it is. And the band only score a national tour through a chance YouTube debacle involving The Naked Drummer. <br/><br/>Rainn Wilson can really play his drums, so looks comfortable behind a kit onstage, and I would wager he's beaten the boards in his share of star-grasping bands; yet none of the other players are worth throwing tomatoes at: lead guitarist/ songwriter/ vocalist, Curtis (Teddy Geiger) is a real-life artist, but never puts his mouth close enough to the mic onstage to obscure his pretty face for the director; Josh Gad drives keyboardists down dweeb highway back into the dork ages, with his useless miming and gutless personality; and bassist Amelia (Emma Stone, SUPERBAD) channels Tia Carrera from WAYNE'S WORLD with her faux-picking and arbitrary non-chords on the bass neck, while completely forgetting she's on Earth only to look hot and procreate, not pretend to have talent. <br/><br/>Christina Applegate is already a MILF! (The shelf-life of women as hotties is so short! And Sean Connery is still man-meat!) She's Fish's love interest - the mom who improbably falls for the shiftless hooligan who refuses to grow up for no reason other than the script says so. <br/><br/>A remixed, meaty version of Twisted Sister's I Wanna Rock heralds the start of the band's road trip, which culminates in a big concert supporting Fish's old band, Vesuvius, who are now so successful they speak in British accents. A.D.D. goes onstage as a support act with the full lightshow - since when have asshole headliner road crews been so supportive?<br/><br/>THE ROCKER touches briefly on its promise in many places - it's at least as enjoyable as watching Poison have arguments onstage - but delivers a sappy ending that ruins every promise of comedy, reality and faith in humankind. With lame, angst-ridden GenX songs ten years too late to be fashionable, there is every indication A.D.D. are on their way to superstardom - because the script says so.<br/><br/>Fish gets the MILF, the dork keyboardist gets his virgin organ smoked, and guitarist Curtis falls for bassist Amelia, as if they are some kind of soul-mate pairing, rather than the high maintenance headache Curtis has just derailed his career with. I can see the long road head: he spends time writing in his studio, she complains she has needs; he screws her every night, she complains he only wants sex; a groupie looks at him sideways, she won't talk to him for a week; he doesn't look at other girls, she complains he is too attached to her; he writes a song with another girl's name in it, she refuses to play it; he pays all the bills, she gripes she feels like a prostitute; they go dutch, she whines that a ""real man"" would pay for everything; he wants to go on tour, she wants to have kids...<br/><br/>This ain't rock and roll. This is - genocide!"
