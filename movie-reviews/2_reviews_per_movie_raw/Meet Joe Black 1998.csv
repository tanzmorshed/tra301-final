"eamon-hennedy","10","516","573","17 November 2003"," A gorgeous film.
","A three hour film about death. It doesn't sound like much when you say it like that, but trust me, Meet Joe Black is an outstanding film and is without doubt one of the most underrated little gems I have ever seen. The film is beautiful in every regards; the photography, the sets, the music and the performances, especially the performances. The last time Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were on screen together it was the equally sublime Legends of the Fall, here it is another sublime film and once again they are putting in some of their best work. The characters that they play, Bill Parrish and Death, bring out a fantastic chemistry between the two performers, especially in the more comedic moments when they two are getting to know each other. However, while death is the main theme of the film, director Martin Brest remembers to filter optimism into his wonderful tale in the shape of a love story between Parrish's daughter (played by the beautiful Claire Forlani) and Death himself. This results in one of the most gorgeous coupling in recent years as well as one of the most erotically intense love scenes I have ever watched.<br/><br/>Director Brest presents the film in a more artistically filtered view than most other directors might have done. The love scene is done without nudity with close ups on the actors throughout. The striking presentation of the lighting in the film is also fantastic, with a lovely golden glow pouring of the screen and lastly Thomas Newman's music is quite simply marvelous. Films like The Green Mile, The Shawshank Redemption and American Beauty which have featured music by this outstanding composer have been enhanced by the haunting, lyrical and moving melodies he has composed and this film is no exception. The mixture of piano and orchestra builds to an uplifting and emotional pull that cements his position as one of the best music composers working in modern film today.<br/><br/>The three hour running time would appears to be problematic, but alas it is not. In fact like another sweeping romantic epic, Titanic, you will not feel the time going in. The three hours fly by and not only that, like the Oscar winning epic, this is a film that makes one instantly want to re-watch it again and again. Meet Joe Black is a wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama and is done exceedingly well. Brad Pitt puts in one of his finest performances as Death finds himself enchanted by human emotions and then finds himself making a deeply human choice at the end of the film and then there is Hopkins. One of cinema's finest actors no matter what he is in, he shows with his complex range of emotions in his performance there is more to him  than playing Hannibal Lecter. His performance here restrained and quite frankly very well done. It is perhaps one of his best acting performances. His Shakespeare background obviously coming in handy for a film that contains many a Shakespearean like moment.<br/><br/>The film, while not a flop, was not the box office hit that was expected, especially considering the main casting, but if you can make up your own mind, do watch Meet Joe Black. This is a wonderful film and is a personal favorite of mine."
"baumer","9","377","428","12 July 1999"," A powerful movie about not taking life for granted
","It's easy to wake up every day and see what is wrong with your life. Everyone has their vices and their shortcomings. Whether you are a billionaire with a perfect spouse, a cottage, a beach house, nice cars and wonderful parents or if you are a single parent struggling to get by on measly paycheck, we can all find something that is wrong with life. Such is human nature. But what can we do to remedy that situation. What can we do to try and ensure that our life gets better? And is it all really that bad? Meet Joe Black is a movie that asks us to look at ourselves and realize that this life is a gift and one that perhaps is taken for granted a little too much. Meet Joe Black asks us to ask ourselves: is it really all that bad?<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins plays Bill. Bill is a very successful business man but it is his time. We all have to die one day, it is a part of life. And this is Bill's time. But before he goes, the Grim Reaper pays him a visit and offers him time. That is all. Just time. And in exchange Bill will show Death what it is like to be alive. A bit of an oxymoron for sure but true nonetheless. And what happens when Death starts to learn about what makes our life so precious is really something that has to be seen. Because what we take for granted, he sees as innocent and pure and magical. For instance, peanut butter. Joe Black tastes it and decides that it is the most amazing food that he has ever had in his short existence. And when people are eating their caviar at dinner, he refrains and has more peanut butter. This scene is one of the purest and most honest scenes in the film. Not for what is on the outside, but what it means, what it wants us to see. To me this scene is the microcosm of what the film and what life should be about.<br/><br/>Life is a gift. There are so many wonderful things that we have as human beings that we seem to forget what they are. We are so consumed with other things that at the time seem important but when you look at them closely they are trivial and it's the little things in life that bring us so much joy. Like peanut butter, aka tossing the ball around with your kids, aka. being lazy in the shade with your Collie. The point is that life is serious enough and it isn't until others are gone that we fully comprehend that.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is perfect, absolutely perfect as Joe Black. He conveys the innocent wonder and pure joy of discovering human elements like the aforementioned peanut butter and more serious issues like falling in love.<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black has been criticized for its length but like all movies that are three hours plus, there is a reason for that. And that is because it has something to say. Something important to say. Meet Joe Black wants us to look at this film and then look at our lives and realize that there is a lot to live for. You just have to get through all the mist and cloudiness and you'll find it again. There is an innocence about how this movie feels and it is such a wonderful picture. It makes you feel good. Good to be in love ( if you are ) good to want to be in love ( if you are not already) and good to be alive.<br/><br/>See this film. It will make you glad that you did. I know I was and my life doesn't seem so bad right now even though there are many things that I could complain about like...... Ah hell, what's the point. Life can only get better. Meet Joe Black helped me see that."
"PoorSlobWithoutAName","Null","263","301","11 December 2002"," A Truly Enchanting Movie!
","Meet Joe Black is a beautiful film with a talented cast.  Because it is unique, the plot enables humor to be weaved within the dramatic and romantic elements.  The music, composed by Thomas Newman (Shawshank Redemption, Erin Brokovich) truly enhances the movie.  The many string and piano melodies are beautiful, and fit smoothly. There are so many memorable moments, like father-daughter conversations, and the scene in the coffee shop. Brad Pitt, in his portrayal of Death,displays naive and vulnerable feelings, skillfully in sharp contrast his behavior at the beginning of the film.  While some criticize its length and unrealistic aspects of the plot, I found it to be so captivating and quite well-made.  Meet Joe Black has an indescribable effect on me whenever I watch it. The story of Death being apprentice to a respected, accomplished man makes one realize the simple beauties of life-- passion, family, love... and peanut butter."
"BrandtSponseller","10","289","333","25 April 2005"," A Minimalist Masterpiece
","Somewhere in the netherworld between being a ""remake"" and merely ""inspired by"" Mitchell Leisen's 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday, Meet Joe Black is the story of Death personified. Death takes over the body of Brad Pitt's unnamed character, later donned ""Joe Black"" by William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins). Although the motivation isn't specified but implied in this film, Death wishes to experience the life he normally takes away--he wants to see what it's like to be human. He chooses Parrish to be his guide because Parrish is a hugely successful media mogul who has conviction, strong ""moral fiber"" and insight on life. Compounding the situation, Parrish's daughter, Susan (Claire Forlani), is a woman whom Brad Pitt's unnamed character met in a coffee shop that morning and had an instant mutual attraction with. Black sticks close by William's side through much of the film, creating difficult situations at a time when Parrish's company is trying to deal with a financially attractive but ethically unsavory takeover bid, and he also puts the boil to somewhat strained familial relationships.<br/><br/>First, a word of warning. This is a very long film (3 hours), and it tends to be very slowly paced. If you are averse to either, or if you do not like any of the three principalsPitt, Hopkins and Forlani--I'd advise you to avoid the film.<br/><br/>For me, I never think that a film's length is a problem in itself. As long as the film works, I'd be happy with it lasting 4, 5, even 12 hours or more--heck, I even gladly sat through Gettysburg (1993) in the theater. There have been films I've thought were too long (such as Whatever Happened to Baby Jane, 1962), but it's contextual, not related to actual running time.<br/><br/>Helmer Martin Brest directs with a lot of deliberation. Lines of dialogue and responses are stretched out to ""infinity and taken to the depth of forever"". The camera gives us lots of lingering gazes. There is little to no ""action"" in the film. Much of it is similar to David Lynch's famed pregnant pauses. Some people hate that style. I love it (although I love other styles, too--I like variety), and for me, the pacing makes this film seem much shorter than its actual running time. It's the complete opposite of the pacing of, say, Medallion (2003), which is interesting given that both films feature Forlani. It's also interesting to note that Brest's career seems to match the pacing of Meet Joe Black. He's taken 2, 4, 5 and 6 years between films. Obviously, Brest is not in a rush.<br/><br/>If you watch Meet Joe Black immediately after watching Death Takes a Holiday, as I did this time around, a few things might strike you as odd and slightly negative at first. The principal difference that had this initial effect on me was the change in the primary romantic relationship--between Joe and Susan (and between Prince Sirki (Frederic March) and Grazia (Evelyn Venable) in the original). In the original, it's ambiguous whether Grazia doesn't recognize Sirki for what he really is all along. She at least never meets him as Sirki rather than Death-as-Sirki. It creates interesting philosophical scenarios about humankind's conception and fear of death; Grazia, who is a bit aloof all along, may be embracing death rather than fearing it, not as something negative, but more metaphysically, as inherent in the idea of life.<br/><br/>In Meet Joe Black, Susan falls for Pitt as another character first. It removes all of the philosophical points about one's attitude towards death (with the exception of William, who is the only one who knows the truth, even in the end, and who implicitly goes through vacillating feelings about death). However, despite my initial hesitation on the change, I tried to remember my commitment to judge each film on its own terms rather than its relation to other works, and I realized that the relationship set up here is interesting for another reason--it explores public identity in relationships and the tensions that arise through dynamicism of that public identity. That's a theme throughout the film, not just in its romantic relationships.<br/><br/>Pitt has often been criticized for his performance here, but in my opinion, it's perfect for the character(s)--just as good in its own way as March's turn as Sirki in the original. Once Pitt as Death takes over ""Joe Black's"" body, he _must_ change his persona in the way he does. He's supposed to be a supernatural being who normally relates to the world in a completely different way, but now he's suddenly made corporeal. He doesn't know what to do as a human. As an entity, he's not daft, lacking power or unknowledgeable about many things, but he's incredibly naïve and awkward as a thing of flesh. He's not used to relating to the world in that way. He's not used to making facial expressions. He's never tasted food, and so on. The change he undergoes in the beginning and end of the film is amazing and shows just how skilled Pitt is.<br/><br/>Hopkins and Forlani are of course no slouches, either. Hopkins' ability to go from understated and elegant to manic is put to good use; the role seems tailor-made for him. Forlani, who has a very unusual but intriguingly beautiful face that always looks a bit pouty, gets to pout even more, creating a bizarrely complex but effective character. The rest of the primary cast is just as good. The end result is a strangely dysfunctional family with a lot of depth.<br/><br/>While I can see people preferring Death Takes a Holiday to this film, for me, Meet Joe Black is slightly better. It's much more epic, of course, and that scope, plus the incredible score by Thomas Newman, pushes its emotional effectiveness up a notch. But make sure you do not miss either film. Both are excellent and unusual."
"bostockleigh-75918","10","14","14","24 October 2019"," A true benchmark in film making
","In protest to all the remade junk Hollywood is producing these days, I'm watching a movie that's as good to watch the 10th time as it was the first (and I speak from experience).
This movie is a tribute to all who came together in it's making. It's Claire Forlani's finest hour, Brad Pitt is superb and Anthony Hopkins is brilliant to name a few. If you've never watched it, I challenge you: It will melt your heart, and it will become a standard. Hats off to the screenwriters who adapted the story so well, to the actors who plainly put their hearts into this, to wardrobe, lighting, scenery who put everything in place, and most of all to the Director who had a passionate and clear vision of what he wanted from every scene."
"fredschepers","10","19","20","19 January 2020"," 22 years later. And it still knocks you out.
","Film reviews are irrelevant. Perception is key. Meet Joe Black is a meet on its own. If you are not into romantic tear jerkers, watch this film and find out that your human and have the ability to change your mind. I speak from experience. The story: Simple and easy to understand. The director made a simple life event into a magical experience. Love and death go hand in hand in a mixture of sublime acting, awesome sceneries, superb dialogues, nerve touching details and result in a romantic drama where the sadness and emotions do not cover the happy ending and leaves you choked till the last over the rainbow tune ends. After 40 years of watching thousands of films, this film still is my number 1 film in my top 100 films where all one hundred share the first place. Brad Pitt, Sir Anthony Hopkins (brilliant classical composer btw) and the gorgeous Claire Forlany showed of their qualities. Same for all the other participants in thisepic story about how life will go on. Perception. ... but from my pov their best acting ever. I have seen it at least once every 2 years. If it will be your first time, settle for it. If you are still young, and think you become a film addict, be aware! You will get drawn in this film for decades to come. Enjoy this experience. And let it knock you out as well ☺"
"lmoore520","Null","175","214","13 October 2004"," In short, an excellent and not too long film
","Whenever this film is aired, I'm drawn to watch it. The pace, like life, is slow. Some people find this to be a problem. I feel sorry for those people; maybe they've been so saturated by ""fast food"" films and reality TV that they think that's the way life is supposed to be. Unlike life, the film has no ""wasted space"". So, while it may seem too long for theatre viewing, it's plenty short for sitting back in an easy chair for three hours and just letting it draw you in--with the excellent dialogue (including the Patois), excellent performances by truly talented actors, and above all the [again] excellent score by Mr. Newman. If you're a romantic not just about love, but also about life, then treat yourself and watch it."
"jwebond","10","183","229","21 November 2004"," Purely Captivating!
","I first saw this film many years after its first release and let me tell you I have never since or will I ever see such a moving and purely captivating movie.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is already my idol and I have admired him for many years. There's something about the unique persona he brings upon any character he plays in a movie, as if he leaves part of himself behind on the film reel each time. From psychological thrillers like The Silence of the Lambs to emotional dramas, he also strikes me as a modest man and is, in my eyes a true genius!<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black is a strange tale that challenges our preconceptions of death. You come out of the film not so much enlightened but convinced that Bill Parrish is happy with the fate that comes upon him and that everyone else is too. It's immensely sad yet happy at the same time and thought-provoking. It is also a very long movie, which I believe strengthens it as you feel you have a bond with the main characters having known them for a long time and thus share the highs and the lows emotionally throughout the plot. <br/><br/>Providing you can stick to the 3hour film length it will truly be one of the most memorable films you'll ever watch. Excellent!"
"ilovedavii","10","31","36","6 December 2016"," For the Romantics Out There
","This movie is spectacular. It's 3 hours long, and without any ""action."" It is simply a study of life and relationships (familial, friendly, romantic, etc.). These relationships are studied by Death, who is taking a vacation. He wants to see what all the fuss is about life. This is an entity who constantly witnesses the end of life, but wants to understand what comes before that end; why do people get so emotional when lit's their time?<br/><br/>In the beginning, he's seemingly emotionless. He's completely uncomfortable with being human, oblivious to all emotion and facial expressions. The character goes through a beautiful transformation from the beginning of the movie to the end, and Brad Pitt does a wonderful job portraying that transformation. <br/><br/>Pitt also does an excellent job of portraying a person who is experiencing everything for the first time. Through his performance, the viewer is reminded how beautiful simple things in life are. Peanut butter, a father enjoying dinner with his family, a friend offering a handshake, falling in love; all of these are the types of things that humans tend to take for granted so often. <br/><br/>There is one particular scene that comes to mind, when Bill Parish is faced with cake- tasting, and says something that hurts his daughter's feelings. Joe Black watches in fascination as Bill fixes the situation, and he (Joe) laughs along with the family. Pitt perfectly shows how Joe is gradually connecting with humanity, thanks to Bill and the way he brings his family together. <br/><br/>Hopkins also deserves praise of the highest regard. His character is charismatic, empathetic, and has a love for his family that shines. It's blatantly obvious why Death chose Bill to be his guide; because he is a stellar person. Hopkins does an excellent job, as always. <br/><br/>Another performance that I loved was the old Jamaican woman, played by Lois-Kelly Miller. In a touching scene, Death reveals to her that his existence is a lonely one. She tells him, in one of my favorite lines of the movie:<br/><br/>""It nice it happen to you. Like you come to the island and had a holiday. Sun didn't burn you red-red, just brown. You sleep and no mosquito eat you. But the truth is, it bound to happen if you stay long enough. So take that nice picture you got in your head home with you, but don't be fooled. We lonely here mostly too. If we lucky, maybe, we got some nice pictures to take with us.""<br/><br/>It's a beautiful monologue, and ever since watching this movie for the first time, I now think of moments in my life as ""pictures"" to take with me when it's my time to leave this earth. <br/><br/>This movie also has, by far, one of the most beautiful soundtracks I have ever heard. Two of the stand-out tracks to me are ""Cold Lamb Sandwich"" and ""That Next Place,"" both of which are breathtakingly emotional.<br/><br/>***Spoiler Territory****<br/><br/>The ending of this movie is one of the most beautiful endings I have ever seen. It's heartbreaking to watch Death realize that he has to return to his lonely existence, after falling in love with humanity. He tells Bill that he is taking Susan with him, and we understand that he wants to do so because he desperately doesn't want to be lonely. It's heartbreaking to watch him realize that Susan needs and deserves the man she met in the coffee shop, not him. He has to let her go, fully understanding that he has to put her needs above his own. He's experienced the beauty of life, and now he's forced to experience the pain in life. <br/><br/>The scene when he watches the firework show and sheds tears fully cements his transformation, from an emotionless entity to a human being who is overcome by the tragic beauty of life. Bill's words, ""It's hard to let go, isn't it?...Well, that's life. What can I tell you."" perfectly capture the message of this movie. Life is beautiful, even when it's coming to an end. <br/><br/>***End of Spoilers***<br/><br/>This is a movie for romantics. It is slow-paced, and requires the viewer to pay attention in order to follow the story and really understand the movie. But if you are willing to give this movie your attention, fully submerse yourself in it, and allow yourself to emotionally connect to it, then you will not be disappointed. Do yourself a favor and watch it."
"Pork_Scratchings","9","151","195","9 January 2000"," One of the best films of 1998, I can't praise this film enough!
","I must admit to have been slightly hesistant when I first heard about Meet Joe Black because of the subject matter and its length, however I found this film to be superb.<br/><br/>The acting was believable, the cinematography of the film was well thought out and extremely picturesque. The soundtrack by Thomas Newman (the Shawshank Redemption) went from chilling to the most beautiful melodies that I have ever heard (giving, in my humble opinion, any classical composer a run for their money), adding an extra depth to this film.<br/><br/>There are no in-betweens in this film: you WILL either love or hate this film. However, I can say that this film is one of the most uplifting and life affirming movies that I have ever seen. It left me both moved and confident that the world was not such a bad place after all. Just like the Shawshank Redemption told us that hope is not a bad thing, so Meet Joe Black tells us that indeed love can conquer all better than Titanic ever could."
"Lechuguilla","8","140","181","16 January 2005"," Reflective And Philosophical
","For a long time I put off watching this, because I have no interest in superficial, teen comedy flicks, as implied by the film's pedestrian title and by the casting of a youthful Brad Pitt. But ""Meet Joe Black"" is anything but ""superficial"", and ""teen comedy"" does not describe this movie at all.<br/><br/>Set in contemporary New York, the film follows a wealthy family whose patriarchal sixty-five year old head, played by Anthony Hopkins, is nearing the end of his life. Enter ""Joe Black"" (Brad Pitt), a handsome, but enigmatic, young man with an unusual agenda.<br/><br/>This is a thought-provoking movie about mortality and emotional separation. It will appeal to viewers with a reflective and philosophical nature. But the film also has humor, which keeps it from being grim. The pace is slow. There's lots of silence and stillness, entirely appropriate, given the subject matter. Among other things, the film presents the novel idea that a supernatural being can be subject to human emotions, and can make mistakes in judgment resulting from those emotions.<br/><br/>The film is not perfect. The plot is a tad egocentric. There's no reference to the universality and ongoing occurrence of death outside the confines of this family. Also, why now? Why does death choose to engage life in our present world, why not five hundred years ago? Minor script changes could have addressed these issues. The initial meeting between Susan (Claire Forlani) and Joe Black seems a little too convenient, but forms the basis for a plot twist that strengthens the overall story.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent. Anthony Hopkins is, as usual, outstanding. I would not have cast Brad Pitt in the role he plays, but he does a good job. Appropriate for this movie, the acting style for both Pitt and Forlani is one wherein they communicate their characters to viewers largely by means of their eyes, which, as taught by ancient philosophers, are the windows of the soul.<br/><br/>For viewers who liked ""The Sixth Sense"", another serious film with depth of meaning, I recommend ""Meet Joe Black"" most highly."
"Verbal-17","10","120","156","5 December 1998"," A wonderful celebration of life and love that is no less than Oscar-worthy
","I went to this movie not expecting all that much.  However, I was amazed by the way it slowly creeps up on you, and delivers such an emotional wallop that when it was over I decided that Saving Private Ryan was the only movie that has come out this year that was more powerful than this movie.  Anthony Hopkins again astounds the movie-going world with one of his best performances, and he deserves an Oscar.  One of the reasons that I think this movie has not gotten the attention it deserves is due to timing: it came out soon after What Dreams May Come, a movie with similar themes. However, while that movie mostly depended on special effects, this movie has very little special effects, but has easily twice the emotional power.  I highly recommend it to anyone who may have overlooked it- you will not be disappointed."
"supergirl182","10","136","180","15 April 2006"," Absolutely Spectacular Movie that leaves you Pondering for Days Afterward
","I thought this movie was quite clearly spectacular. I mean, from the trailer it looked like some teen, low-production-cost flick that I'd stay as far away as possible, but in truth, the movie was deep, meaningful and left you thinking about it for ages and ages afterward.<br/><br/>The actors were brilliant. I thought Brad Pitt, against a lot of people's expectations, performed very convincingly, and Anthony Hopkins, as always, stunned me and transported me. Claire Forlani was the only main actress who suffered slightly but still pulled off a reasonable performance. I personally thought the Jamaican Woman, played by Lois Kelly-Miller was very touching, and the conversations between most of the characters were all interesting and well, some of the advice you could put into use in your own daily lives.<br/><br/>The story line is edgy and dwells on sensitive subjects such as Death, Love and Happiness, I suppose. The wisdom behind it is unmistakable. I think this movie is underrated. Despite the disappointing Trailer, the movie will blow you away. I watched it on VCD, something that has low-ish quality on a computer, yet I managed to sit through all 170 minutes, completely stunned and unable to budge from concentration.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is definitely recommended. A bit deep for your kids, I guess- I tried watching it with my niece but she ruined it slightly by everlasting flow of questions.<br/><br/>I'm giving it a 10/10 for it being emotional and funny at times. Overall a serious movie, and one that will truly make you think. It is quite complex and will definitely leave some strings untied, but I guess a bit of room for imagination never hurt anyone."

","Have you ever watched a movie where you are taken from one beautiful moment to another, and continues until the very end? well 'Meet Joe Black' is one such film.<br/><br/>There are many other excellent reviews of this movie, and while I subscribe to most of those opinions, I like most how 'Meet Joe Black' puts the viewer in a rather unique perspective: To be able to 'feel' the characters innermost feelings through subtleties of their speech. How do you honestly answer a question you aren't supposed to, yet answer the question honestly? This movie is full of nuances of such dialogue exchanges which contain a superficial, yet profound undertone throughout.<br/><br/>I also like the presence Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani bring to the screen, and the complementary performances that resemble a finely-tuned symphony. The storyline, dialogue and character development is beautifully crafted through a remarkable script - and very fine acting. The musical score is also well done in this film, and is a true delight to hear."
"dennis_chiu1","9","12","16","4 April 2010"," A Wonderful Film
","It is rare to see a film that is as quiet as it is forceful. It's like standing before a breathtaking view alone with only the sounds of life and nature. Such a view inspires awe, reverence and silence. This comes close to the unusual feeling I get whenever I watch ""Meet Joe Black"".<br/><br/>I had the occasion to watch it again on HBO, and I was caught up in its magic one more time.<br/><br/>Yes, it is of ungainly length (3 hours), and it is slow by modern film standards, but it engrosses me, because it is unique. Director Martin Brest and acting heavyweights Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt make each scene so weighty and powerful that the hidden drama of Death, literally personified by Mr. Pitt's character Joe Black, presence with good man William Parrish, Anthony Hopkins, never leaves the viewers attention.<br/><br/>Mr. Pitt acts with a gentleness and power that he has rarely demonstrated in any other character. Mr. Hopkins portrayal leaps off the screen like a force of nature equaling death, itself -- how many actors can do that?<br/><br/>The final corporate war confrontation between the character of Drew, portrayed by gifted actor Jake Weber (from TV's ""Medium""), versus Black and Parrish is a true delight - Mr. Weber would have to be gifted to hold his own in a scene with Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins (and he does so on three separate occasions in the film).<br/><br/>Of special note is the performance by Claire Forlani, portraying the daughter of William Parrish, who falls in love with Joe Black. She has a special gentleness in her performance which makes it completely believable that if something like ""Death"" physically walked the Earth, he would fall in love with her.<br/><br/>I wish that a film like ""Meet Joe Black"" could have reached its audience at 3 hours, like ""Titanic"", but life and the world does not work that way.<br/><br/>I do hope anyone who reads this review, gives this film a chance, and lets its quiet passion sweep them up."
"Xophianic","8","18","27","15 February 2000"," Long, boring at parts, but when it picked up it was great
","I was a little hesitant to watch this movie, seeing as how it was 3 hours long, but I decided to give it a try. As I sort of expected, much of the first part was fairly slow moving and a bit boring. But if you stick with MEET JOE BLACK, it gets a little more exciting and you'll find the story a bit more interesting.<br/><br/>William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a very successful businessman who has raised a good family, had a good career and has lead a good life. Then one day, Death (Brad Pitt) comes to William and offers him more time to be alive in exchange for Parrish showing him around life. Death, using the name Joe Black, really starts to enjoy life and fall in love with Parrish's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani). When this happens, he considers changing the rules of life & death.<br/><br/>The plot is very original and fairly interesting. I think it would have been a little less boring if there wasn't a dramatic pause between every sentence. The beginning of this movie is actually pretty good, but the rest of the first half tends to drag a bit. The second half still has similar flaws, but because the characters have been set and the plot really starts to threaten, it is a lot more interesting. I had mixed feelings for the ending. I thought it was OK, but it could have been a little better. The ending was kind of predictable, but not especially since it was hard to tell where they were going with it. Half of the movie is predictable and half of it wasn't.<br/><br/>The acting was superb in this movie, as expected with a veteran like Anthony Hopkins and a newer, but talented, face like Brad Pitt. Hopkins, in my humble opinion, stole the show right out from under Pitt, who I think was meant to be the showcase. Claire Forlani did pretty well as the adorable girlfriend of Pitt, and I thought the Jamaican Lady, played by Lois Kelly-Miller, and was both funny and noble. I loved the scenes between her and Pitt, and I thought Pitt was very funny speaking a Jamaican accent.<br/><br/>The character development in this movie was pretty good. It was pretty cool to see the Grim Reaper himself (Joe Black/Death) have feelings and curiosity about life, let alone fall in love with someone. You can relate to Parrish, even though he plays an old fart, because he knows that his death is coming and he is, naturally, trying to tie up loose knots. You would do this too if Death came to you and said ""Hey, you're gonna die in a week. So, how 'bout them Yankees?"" Both of Parrish's daughters represent two stereotype daughters. One was the older, favorite daughter who is struggling with her feelings about love. The other is the younger daughter who is jealous of her older sister, but is married. Again, I loved the Jamaican Lady, but I don't think I would have if it weren't for Pitt's excellent dialogue with her.<br/><br/>If you don't like long movies, you'd better stay away from this one. If you're a Pitt fan, you'll love it because he is everywhere on this film. I'd still say this is one great film and that you should check it out, but not if you have a bad attention span."

","I was not at all surprised to see four writers on the credits for this film, as it is such an inconstant mish-mash of one ill-defined character after another. There was no way only one thinking person wrote this film. The film moves ponderously from one glacially paced scene after another. I saw this movie at 8:00 in the evening and by 9:00 my son had to shake me because I was snoring in the theater. I don't recall ever falling asleep during a movie before, but ""Meet Joe Black"" did it to me. It is hard to say how long I was ""out"" for. The same scene I was watching when I lost consciousness was still on when I was awakened. In this film that could mean I was out for a second or two or for 10 minutes. The scenes just go on and on and on with not much of anything being said.<br/><br/>My wife was crying through the whole picture and was deeply moved by the whole affair. When I asked her why she said the truths of the movie touched her. To save you from three hours of trite tediousness I present those truths to you now: 1). Families should love one another, 2) don't marry unless you are in love, and 3) good people don't have to fear death. I would add to this list: 1) You can fall in love with someone if he looks like Brad Pitt even though his personality changes repeatedly and you have no idea who he is, 2) death does not know what peanut butter is, but can slip in and out of a Jamaican riff at the drop of a hat, and 3) overly contrived plotting is not the dead art we all hoped it would be by now.<br/><br/>Now before I start hearing the obvious `This guy just hates Brad Pitt' remarks, you should know that I am the Brad Pitt fan in my house. I think Brad is a wonderful actor, but he is so wasted in this drivel. Likewise, Anthony Hopkins has nowhere to go with this script. Is he the hard-driven businessman with a lust for life so great that he attracts the attention of death itself, or is he the guy wasting away his few remaining hours on this planet playing solitaire? Is he the shrewd businessman who is in constant control of every situation, fast thinking and powerful, or is he a guy who stands there with a dumb, dull look on his face when questioned about the mysterious Joe Black, letting his company slip through his fingers? One minute he is calm and collected in his dealings with death, the next he explodes, saying he's fed up, the next he's calm again, and back and forth. Hopkins is a wonderful actor; unfortunately this script asked him to play three or four different roles as the same character.<br/><br/>My son is a good boy and a wonderful son. however, if he were a great son he would have let me sleep through the rest of this film. I can tell it's getting close to Thanksgiving, the turkey just arrived."
"wherever","1","106","199","3 January 2002"," Try not to insult other people's opinions!
","Please, enough with the ridiculous assumption (for this and other films) that if one didn't like it, one must be somehow intellectual or spiritually inferior to those who did. Surely you can express your opinion about a film without maligning the intelligence of those who don't share it.<br/><br/>
I saw Meet Joe Black in the theater when it came out, which was a grave error. By the last third of the movie I was literally banging my head on the back of the chair in frustration. I came close to walking out, but damn me, I had to see how it all turned out. At this point, that wasn't even worth the time really, because I can look back and say with certainty ""who cares!"". If I were Anthony Hopkins, I would have told Death to kill me now rather than living the rest of my life, if it was going to be so excruciatingly dull! <br/><br/>Please note that when I say that the best part is when Brad Pitt gets run over with the car and thrown through the air, it's not because I want more action in a film. Action films are by far not my favorite genre. I'll take character development over explosions any day. It's simply because the ridiculousness of that moment sums up the whole futile effort that is this film! That moment actually made me *laugh*, and not because I'm cold hearted - I've cried at many a film - but simply because like everything else in this film, it was badly done and elicited the opposite effect that it was attempting to achieve. <br/><br/>My dislike of the movie had nothing to do with my ability to grasp it's ""subtlety"". It was about as subtle as a sledgehammer. Actors staring at each other with cow eyes and waiting a minute between ever line of dialogue doesn't make that dialogue any more meaningful, just spectacularly boring.<br/><br/>
As other reviewers have noted, excising these excruciating pregnant pauses from many of the scenes might have made the film more tolerable. I definitely wish I had a fast forward button. If I had it to do all over again I would have just walked out and rented it later to watch the end and not wasted another second of my life. One other reviewer asked what else could we have been doing with our time. It's not what one does with one's time, it's whether one enjoys it or not, or actually does something productive. The three hours I wasted on Meet Joe Black were neither enjoyable nor productive. Maybe your time isn't precious to you, but mine is to me, and at the very least I could have been watching a better movie!"
"allisonsinclair1976","9","10","14","20 November 2012"," A fabulous film
","Although this is a 3 hr or so movie on waiting for death it is a lot more then that and is a real hidden gem. With the set design, performances and music really make this movie a enjoyable time. While death is a main theme of the movie its really a romance movie between death (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Claire Forlani). It ends up with there being a great chemistry between them with a very intense love scene. There are some real enjoying scenes where death takes the body of a human and slowly learns to be human having his boyish innocence. In exchange for a few extra days Brad and Anthony's character come to an agreement, a few extra days in exchange for a tour a life as a human. A funny scene was just seeing how much he enjoyed peanut butter and seemed to act like it was the greatest thing in the world. It is very easy to wake up every morning and complain about your life and how much better it could be. We can all find something wrong with our lives, it is human nature to. What are the things we can do to change the situation. How can we ensure that our life gets better? Is this really all that bad of a life? This movie asks us to realize that this life is a gift and we shouldn't take it for granted. Death is a by the book robot type of guy but by being in a human world acting like a human at the end he makes more of a human choice rather then a non human emotion. This movie should have won some academy awards it was deserving of so. This is a movie any movie lover should watch and have as part of their collection. Enjoy."
"nicardo","1","55","101","2 June 2000"," Don't meet him
","This could have been a really good film if there had been some consistency with the character of Death. He is powerful and all-knowing when need be, and totally clueless the rest of the time. Death's work is to end every human life at their appointed time, but he has no idea what he's ending. So, for reasons unknown he has the time and ability to find out. Pitt is handsome and charming as a doomed young man in a coffee shop, and handsome, boring and charmless as Death. Hopkins can do great work even in a flawed film. Forlani is believable and beautiful, despite looking as though she is about to fall asleep every five to ten minutes. Not a good quality for a character in a nearly three hour movie. Harden and Tambor (both wonderful talents long before Larry Sanders existed) do some top-quality film work. The message seems to be that family is most important, lots and lots of money is really good, and that death and taxes are still inevitable. I think they also ask the cinematic question, ""Just how long can we get away with keeping the camera focused on a well-groomed Brad Pitt in total silence?"""

Man, check out the pool scene for a steamy romp. Claire goes all out to deliver the most vampish look, and she carries it off very well.<br/><br/>But of course Anthony Hopkins carries the movie. The scenes with him and Brad are priceless. Hopkins is able like none other, to evoke emotions that are integral to the movie's purpose.<br/><br/>There are some sci-fi boundaries that are crossed in this story, which are concepts you just need to accept if you want to enjoy the movie."

Well big deal!!, She did not ""fall in love"" or ""make love"" with some guy from the coffee shop, she fell in love with Death, not knowing who he was.

Very very very disappointing to me."

","I had repeatedly seen this film more than 30 times, but not recently. Still, this is one of the most unforgettable films to me. Every main personality is handsome and pretty, wealthy but never deteriorated, and loves and respects each other. Yes, people may say it is unrealistic, but I wish such people actually exist, or I say we can enjoy such unrealistic things only in movies.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is a good actor, moreover a big star. He has challenged many characters in a variety of films; he had already shown us his acting talent in his early days, such as in ""Se7en""(1995) and ""Twelve Monkeys""(1995), he was even violent and brutal in ""Fight Club""(1999) and ""Snatch"" (2000), and he was a star out of stars in ""Ocean's Eleven""(2001), ""Ocean's Twelve""(2004), and ""Ocean's Thirteen""(2007). But I believe he is the most powerful when he acts such a perfectly handsome man as in this ""Joe Black"" or ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button""(2008). Whether Brad Pitt himself likes this role of Joe Black or not, I think only Brad Pitt could perform it.<br/><br/>There was also one of the most beautiful scenes in the film history. After Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) says good-bye to a young man (Brad Pitt) she got acquainted with and enjoyably chatted with in the coffee shop, they care about each other; when Susan watches the man on his back walking away, he does not turn his face; and when the man watches Susan on her back walking away, she does not turn her face; they repeatedly do so until Susan hesitantly turns left and disappears. They are rather reserved and hesitant, though they like each other. This scene is really excellent and unforgettable with the beautiful sound track music.<br/><br/>William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) is a successful media tycoon, but sensible and even brave to face to his destiny to die, above all, a loving person. He even tells his daughter, Susan, the importance of falling in love with somebody. Anthony Hopkins sufficiently and attractively performs this man who well understands what the life is.<br/><br/>Allison (Marcia Gay Harden) is the William Parrish's first daughter (Susan's elder sister). She always feels her father loves Susan more than herself, still she accepts it and loves her father and her sister Susan, supported by her innocently nice husband, Quince (Jeffrey Tambor). This couple lends spice to this film.<br/><br/>I really enjoy and love this film, even though people say it is too long. I have never felt this is too long. This drama/fantasy/mystery/romance gave me the joy, consolation and tranquil state of mind as well as the optimism to the profound meaning of life."

Even the secondary characters are well done. You feel drawn into the movie. It runs at 3 hours. if you are not looking for an action packed film this is not going to be your cup of tea, but if you are moved by the human condition then you will never even feel the time ticking by. Every time I watch this I feel grateful for the beauty that is love. Hopkins plays the role of the elder prominent businessman with an elegance and grace that is unparalleled. Pitt handles the transition in his character stunningly. His journey into humanity is moving and appropriately awkward. His beauty is a wonderful contrast against the darkness one would expect for his character. Furlani is gorgeous on her own right, but the way she plays Claire is honest and true. The characters Clint, Allison, Drew are also excellent. Pay close attention for the scenes with the Jamaican woman as they are done perfectly."

","And, here, we have a movie that I cannot get enough of. A movie that I use as a standard by which I measure all movies. I had thought that I had reviewed Meet Joe Black years ago but, upon recalling those I have, I find that I have been remiss. Just what makes a ten out of ten for this viewer? The answers follow.<br/><br/>Not necessarily a believable plot but believable characters. I thoroughly enjoyed Anthony Hopkins in this picture. This story was a story of such grand design that it must have been an eminent role for him to sink his teeth into... Faced with the certain limits of his mortality, a captain of industry is faced with a surreal proposition: be a guide to Death in life, and for so long as that engagement is useful the man, Bill Parish, shall live -- for Death has been watching him and has deemed him a suitable tutor. What would such a man think? How would he behave in the face of this? I believe this is Mr. Hopkins greatest role. Hannibal doesn't even touch it. And from Bill the camera swings onto other characters and other stars. Each fully believable in their respective roles. The beautiful Claire Forlani, and this, too, is her best role so far. Jeffrey Tambor, his best, from those movies I have seen him in. Memorable performances from Marcia Gay Harden, Lois-Kelly Miller, Jake Webber, and inspired moments from the title character, as played by Brad Pitt, especially as the guy from the coffee shop.<br/><br/>Beautiful pictures. This may be one of the themes of the story: that the meaning of life is to fill oneself up with beautiful pictures before leaving it, but the cinematography in this picture is truly breath-taking, especially in its conclusion.<br/><br/>Emotion. There is one requirement of a top-ten movie in my book and that is that it remains moving, that it causes the same emotions to stir, that it continues to raise feeling. This movie has achieved that for me. It is, in a word, Classic. Time and repeated viewing has left it unaltered. Bravo, Mr. Brest! My hat is off to you, sir, when will you direct another?"

Anthony Hopkins, in particular, gives one of the richest performances of his career -- as do Jeffrey Tambor and Marcia Gay Harden who shun caricature to show us that rich people can be genuine and kind. This is about the best thing I've seen Brad Pitt do; he shows a remarkable restraint that is perfectly consonant with his character. And Claire Forlani is a wonder.

","Preamble - I started watching this movie on TV about 20 minutes in - just after the helicopter ride into NYC, and I had no idea what I was watching or what to expect...but here goes...<br/><br/>While I can understand where people might like this movie because of the whole death dealing with life angle and whatever else people can pull from this three hour waste of time, there are several things that make absolutely NO SENSE and require the viewer to abandon any sense of logic, which for me, totally destroys this movie.<br/><br/>1) After what's-her-name meets that incredibly charming young man in the coffee shop, they go their separate ways. While they each take turns looking back at each other, that charming young man gets plowed into by several cars, an accident he cannot possibly have survived. This totally rules out the chance of him meeting what's-her-name in the hospital. Next scene is Hopkins hearing and talking to some strange voice. That voice turns out to be the voice of Death, who takes the form of that charming young man from the coffee shop!!! Turns out Death needed a body and took the poor soul from the car accident - without a bruise, scrape, or injury of any kind. Which makes me ask, what the hell? Where did he get this body? What happened to the original body that no doubt would have been picked up by the coroner and locked up in a morgue? Is that body still there? Or is it merely a facsimile of the body, which makes me ask where and at what time was this copy made? Pray to God that Death doesn't happen to run into the poor guy's friends or family.<br/><br/>2) Death then gets to have dinner with Hopkins and meets his family, and in walks what's-her-name. Death is NOTHING like the charming young man in the coffee shop, and is actually kind of annoying. Yet, what's-her-name manages to ""fall in love"" with him. How?!? Based on WHAT exactly?!?! It certainly isn't his charming demeanor - which leads me to conclude that it can only be pure lust.<br/><br/>3) When it's finally time for Death to take Hopkins, they walk over a bridge, and Death is replaced by the charming guy from the coffee shop who simply snaps out of it somehow and is back to his old self. What's-her-name runs over and seems to understand that her father is gone. So. Question 1 - what happens to Hopkins' body? Question 2 - how on earth do you explain the fact that this guy comes back to life? And how does what's-her-name explain and deal with the apparently massive personality disorder this guy must have, since the guy she fell in love with (Death) is in NO WAY like the guy from the coffee shop, before the accident and after he gets resurrected? Awful movie. Terrible."

One think of Death as a worldly being but we find that he has never experienced many things that humans take for granted. Things like love, security and friendship. St first he comes off as heartless having killed a young man for his body. He is uncaring in his first approach to Mr. Parrish, allowing him to fell the pain will come with is death. Then we see his kindness in the hospital when he talks to the elderly black woman and calm her fears. He learns why humans risk everything for just a little more time with those they love.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Black enters the kitchen look for a snack. He is offered some peanut butter and he asks for it on ""just a spoon"". I've never found peanut butter sexier. You can't help but grin as he asks for peanut butter while at a fancy dinner, once again stating ""just a spoon"".<br/><br/>Enough about Death. Hopkins as a man who knows his time has come is outstanding, as Mr. Hopkins always is (has he ever made a bad movie?) I did find Claire Forlani's portrayal of Susan Parrish was a bit off.

This movie gives me valuable life lessons and it's really hard to watch with all those tears coming out from my eyes. A really good movie and it's quite rare for me to write a review, but a movie like this? This is has surpasses my expectations. A must watch movie!"

","I just got through watching this again. I didn't remember that What A Wonderful World/Over the Rainbow by Israel ""IZ"" Kamakawiwoʻole played at the end during the credits. What a beautiful way to end a beautiful movie. I would have made a few different decisions, the main one being a different leading lady. She is crazy attractive but not the greatest talent. Still, she was far from a mistake. Brag Pitt was awesome. I mean, GEEZ! I'm not gay but is this guy good looking or what. It was stupid. And his attitude was perfect for the role. Like the girl said in the movie, his indifferent attitude was sexy...or something like that. Hopkins was Hopkins. This dude couldn't turn in a bad performance if his family was held hostage and the captors demanded a bad performance for their safety. The ending was amazing. It captured the sorrow of love and goodbye perfectly. In closing, this whole movie reminded me of that first love, where you couldn't quite get a good breath and where every second was filled with thoughts of them. Still sad in the end but very romantic. I would think, the perfect date movie...although it is 3 hours. Maybe too long for a date. But try it anyway."

","In 1934, the late great Fredrick March completed a film called ' Death Takes a Holliday.' Splendid and innovative for it's day, it gave one pause on the briefness of life and it's singular, ultimate end. In 1998, a remake of the earlier Classic was made and called "" Meet Joe Black. "" Having seen 'Holiday' I was prepared for it's film resurrection. The gist of the story as written by Ron Osborn is that Death witnesses a sudden and tragic street accident which takes the life of a young man exiting a coffee shop. Assuming his body, Death visits William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) a successful tel-la-communication executive near his 65th birthday and strikes a deal. In exchange for Parrish educating him on the profound sensory delicacies of life, Death will allow him to live until his 65th birthday. The deal is set, until Death discovers he has fallen in love with Susan Perrish (Claire Forlani); William's younger daughter. Another obstacle for William is Drew (Jake Weber) an ambitious, devious and ruthless executive board member who is trying to undermined and destroy all he has built. Unwittingly William's close friend and confident Quince (Jeffrey Tambor) believes Drew and helps to remove and retire Mr. Parrish. The dark plot of this film fills three full hours, but if one follows the fluid direction of Martin Brest, it evolves into a sincere, sympathetic and romantic love story within an innocent, often humorous awakening for the Lord of the Underworld. Despite this being a re-make, it's final result will be seen as a superb recreation and both Hopkins and Pitt are experienced Thespians at their very best. Recommended. ****"

","The first time I saw this movie was on its opening weekend in the US. I was taking my soon to be girlfriend (and later to be ex-girlfriend) to our first date. Naturally you can guess, being a guy I wasn't the one who picked this particular movie to watch. Yet after the first few scenes I was drawn in.<br/><br/>The thoughtful, almost classic literature-like dialog all throughout this movie simply make it a masterpiece. The cast are the key in any such film, and everybody delivers here, especially Anthony Hopkins. The characters truly interact with each other, and you never feel like you've lost a step, you never think that the feelings portrayed are not credible.<br/><br/>The story is endearing, it has a few funny dark comedy moments, but most of all it simply gives an overall good feeling to the viewer. I've read some negative comments regarding the length, all I can tell you is, until I read the comments I never even realized it is three hours long. I had to check the box of my DVD to confirm that it is indeed of the said length.<br/><br/>I also can not finish this comment without giving some extra love for the performance of Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince). He nailed the role down to the last twitch of the thumb. The klutz loving husband who has always got the side of his wife and his family is absolutely the most lovable character of the movie, and everyone understands that he would even be one of ""death's favorites"". An absolute must see movie.<br/><br/>PS: On a side note I would like to mention that this movie has to be watched in the original English speaking version. I have seen it in both Hungarian and French dubs and neither did the amazing dialog any justice."

At one point I turned up the volume to the maximum, and it still seemed like they were whispering. This is not the first movie in which this situation has occurred.<br/><br/>I would appreciate a response from anyone who has or has not experienced this type of a problem.<br/><br/>Thank you.<br/><br/>jecwbc"

","I have watched the movie several times but i don't seem to get enough of it.It clearly showed that a lot of effort was put to the making of it. Ihave an idea, this is how it goes: I think it should make a come back possibly with the same crew and few recruits if possible. This time Bill showing us the trips he took with Joe Black and how difficult it was for him to be taking lives and separating people. This times will be giving the viewers the feeling that Bill has come to contact with (the touch of death, smelling and discussing lives to take and why and when). Drawing a picture of the good and the bad side about death. I think this kind of thinking can also set in motion lot of minds and the thinking around the death."
"mdm27-1","2","25","49","5 May 2003"," The longest three hours you will ever endure.
","It is totally beyond my comprehension that an experienced director could imagine that the subject matter of Meet Joe Black would justify a three hour running time. There are indeed some movies that can pull this off, such as the Lord of the Rings films, or Gladiator (which is two and a half hours), however these do it by employing strong plot elements, exciting action sequences and quality character development. They do not do it by sticking a bunch of big-name actors together on screen, with no clear idea of how their characters are supposed to behave, no  sense of purpose throughout the movie, and a script that consists largely of people staring at each other and saying nothing for a long time -- but this is exactly what Meet Joe Black attempts to get away with. The character development is virtually non-existent, with Joe Black (Brad Pitt) undergoing more personality changes than you can count; the plot itself is melodramatic to the point of farce (including an excruciatingly embarrassing scene where Brad Pitt puts on a poor Jamaican accent to talk to a dying old lady), and the music so tedious that you will be wanting to scream by the time the credits roll. Unfortunately it seems that Meet Joe Black is victim of the ""lovey-dovey"" film culture of Hollywood, whereby innocent lonely hearts can be duped into thinking a film is touching simply because it purports to contain romantic elements. Don't fall for it."

The meaning of life, for one who ever met it on his way, the origin of good which makes even death bow to the ground, that's it - we, humans, are made for LOVE. I can't explain to myself why this movie has so low note from watchers, maybe the LOVE experience isn't as common as I thought? ""When you find love, when you know that it exists..."" - George Michael, and yes, what a terrible amount of LOVE has created us, human beings?

","When my husband and I first saw this movie we were dating. We both thought it was beautifully filmed and a great story. I bought it when I came out on DVD a while ago and my husband watched it (again)when he was home from work (sick). He said he cried his heart out after watching this time because he had a whole new perspective now that he had girls of his own. I can only imagine watching it again as we move closer to Bill Parish's age and thinking it's still a wonderful movie. I was not happy when prof. reviewers picked at stupid things. It was the first time I actually wrote EW magazine complaining that they let Owen review it. He just didn't get it. Anyone that doesn't see the depths of this movie is someone who swims in shallow waters. The cast was perfect, the music was perfect, etc...

"dhh2005","9","12","21","30 June 2007"," Meet Joe Black: a step into reality
","I loved the movie, obviously. First off I love seeing guys who do things so right. Pitt really shows the perfect example of how to hit on a girl in this movie. It was done with such class that every guy should aim to achieve. But this movie like most had certain parts that really hit home for me. Parts like the final dialog between BP and his eldest daughter, where she expresses that she is doing all the work for his party because she, and everyone else, loves him. As she goes on to describe her feelings in relation to her dad and his other daughter, about being his favorite. Any other movie would have the father say thats not true, doing like most of us would, trying to comfort his daughter. But Hopkins doesn't, he just stands there because he knows it's true and he knows that thats life! Not everything will work out so that everyone loves everyone else as much as we all wish they did. Even his daughter admits that, ""it's OK, you're allowed to have favorites. The point is that you were mine."" I love that realism! THATS honesty! Simple words, ""it's OK."" While they don't really change the situation, bring us together and make everything OK. I guess I adore that honesty most because I feel like I have to work SO hard to get it in real life, so maybe that plays too big a part in how I rate my movies. But maybe it doesn't, after all that is what movies are, part of my life. And they only mean anything if you attribute meaning to them. Also, you could say this movie is not a typical chick flick, because the guy doesn't get the girl, per say. But thats another thing that I love about it, death actually does the right thing, none of this love concurs all crap! I'm not trying to kill all that true love really is, but it's nice to see two people actually trying to identify love and not just listing to their feelings, often what people consider love. they identify that this is not an appropriate match. THATS responsibility!!! Ignoring what you feel to do what is right. So the irony is that Joe never really loved her because he really didn't know her that well, and vice verse. Anthony states one factor of love being, ""to not hurt the one you love."" Death was going to do that because he wanted her so bad he was going to take her, and that would hurt her and he wouldn't be showing love. But in the end he doesn't, and at first glance you would say, ""but since he doesn't hurt her and he does fight his feelings to let her live her life, then he does love her."" But if you read between the lines you will see he did it for Anthony. It's that bond between them that he holds on to in order to make his choice. So in the end the man he chose to guide him through life does just that and I guess Joe being a good guy all along picked correctly when we was looking for, ""someone with the ability to instruct."" It's a movie all about this great man at the end of his rope."
"taurus-18","Null","11","19","21 July 2004"," Marcia Gay Harden was extraordinary!
","This is a rather odd film and interesting.  I particularly enjoyed the supporting characters who were all excellent.  I've always been a fan of Jeffrey Tambor's and found his Quince character to be decent and touching. Jake Weber as Drew was terrific.  However, I was blown away by Marcia Gay Harden (playing Allison) and became a big admirer of hers.  I'm so glad she's become recognized and acknowledged!  What a gifted actress she is. Allison is so real and textured.  Marcia makes every scene count. (Mystic River is another example of her great talent.) The best moments in Meet Joe Black were between Marcia and Anthony Hopkins' characters, when she frankly discusses their relationship. She made this movie memorable for me."

","Wow, what a surprise! I usually watch action movies such as Aramgeddon, Bad Boys, Strange Days, and Star Wars, so I had absolutely no interest in watching this film. My mom kept telling me how great it was, so when she said she had watched it three times in two weeks, I knew there had to be something to it. Let me tell you, I was hooked right from the beginning, and captivated until the very end.<br/><br/>This movie makes you remember that it is the people you love that make life worthwhile. I thought about my deceased grandfather, and my former wife in particular. But it only made me recall all the good, happy times with them, and just kind of reminded me of what is important in life.<br/><br/>It's really hard to describe this film, and explain what it is that enamored me, but all I can say is JUST WATCH IT.<br/><br/>I think the reason this movie did poorly at the theater is because the trailer does not portray accurately what it is about. After watching the film, I watched the trailer on the DVD, and said, ""That is not the movie I just watched."""
"sligocait","8","5","7","27 April 2010"," A lovely remake of ""Death Takes A Holiday""
","This movie is a remake of a classic '40's movie called ""Death Takes A Holiday"", and while remakes can be chancy, this one is sweet and fun to watch. My only quibble is that the movie is a bit long, but all the scenes are woven together so that the length of the movie (3 hours) pass by seamlessly. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt, especially, are wonderful together and it is very interesting to see the youthful Pitt be in the 'power' position with the far-more-established, older (and always superb) Anthony Hopkins. Pitt's portrayal of Death incarnate is delightful as he attempts to navigate the world of the living; his often naive but utterly honest character is delightful to watch and Hopkins carries off his role of guide to Pitt with his typical panache and elegance. The supporting cast of Claire Forlani, Marcia Gay Harden, Jeffrey Tambor and Jake Weber are all superb and perfectly cast in their roles. I would be remiss without mentioning the musical score by Thomas Newman. It is gorgeous, sumptuous and stunning in places.<br/><br/>In fact, the final scene (which I won't ruin here!) is made so much more poignant with the gorgeous music of the soundtrack adding to the emotion of the moment that the music is, as is often the case in movies, like another member of the cast. If you are a fan of any of these actors or just enjoy movies with a pleasant and/or slightly supernatural plot, this movie will not disappoint you. There is a touch of comedy, a lot of pathos and an offbeat love story all mixed into one, and if you can watch the last ten minutes of this movie without feeling moved to tears I would encourage you to check your pulse because, music included, it is a stunningly beautiful ending. Take a chance and get to know Mr Black..he and the Parrish family are worth it!"
"njpcoenen","10","5","7","30 August 2009"," Who ever said Pitt cant act?
","In all honesty, i watched this film for the first time only two months ago. Standing in Barnes and Nobles, I saw the DVD potent with its front cover of Brad Pitt. I am a fan of some of his movies, but I've never been a huge Brad Pitt fan, and have always thought him (for no particular reason, most likely due to his epic media coverage) to be very commercial in what roles he chooses (oh how ashamed I feel of my judgment). However, only the year before had i watched The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Absolutely astounded by his performance, i decided to give this movie a go. After watching the whole 178 minutes of it, i finished the credits, stood up, walked into my apartment bathroom, cleared my eyes of tears, both fresh and hour-old, and looked in the mirror whilst thinking ""never again will i doubt this man"".<br/><br/>When you think about it, Pitt is not really a commercial actor at all, although he is constantly abused by this term. In actual fact, he is one of the most underrated actors of this industry. Se7en, Fight Club and countless more of his films have shown high quality and calibre. Th only film i could possibly dig on him would be Mr and Mrs Smith, and even THAT wasn't a complete horror. Meet Joe Black, however, could possibly be the best performance he has ever accomplished.<br/><br/>From the very beginning, this man is likable and captivating. He immerses the audience, both women AND men alike, with his unique charm, and I must say, i felt quite depressed when I realized i wouldn't be seeing this character through the majority of the film. Yet, as soon as Death came out into the field, i caught attention once again. How he has depicted two completely opposite characters, yet given both a likability any person watching would desire, is astonishing. His portrayal of Death is ultimately simple yet so, so deep. And, not only with a supernatural seriousness, but Pitt layers this character with humour and affection, both aspiring to absolute chemistry with fellow leads Hopkins and Forlani. Every actor is triumphantly amazing in this picture, however, if not simply due to the unnecessary and unjustified criticism he gets, Brad Pitt is the ruby on the golden crown, and i walk away from watching this film with he as one of my favourite actors of all time, and Meet Joe Black as one of my favourite movies of all time. I salute everyone who affected the outcome in any way, shape or form of this epic film of love."
"movicas","10","5","7","4 August 2009"," You can not miss this movie
","Meet Jo Black is a combination of comedy, romance and drama one of the best movies I have ever seen. This film last for three hours and it is a story of Death personified. In this movie you realize the value of life and appreciate the time you have on this planet since nobody knows how long it will last. The story starts with the scene where a couple Joe Black and Susan Parish meet in a cafeteria and find themselves in love; after this he leaves to go to work and while he is on his way he stops to think and wanting to go back to find out more about her he stops in the middle of the street and a car hits him causing his death. On the other hand Susan's father William Parish, a very important man who lives a very stressful life is experiencing a strong pain in his chest and feels like his time is very close to the end. He even starts hearing a voice, the voice of death. At the same time death is looking for a body to use in order to explore and discover how human life is. This body is Joe's body. Brad Pitt as Joe Black, is the perfect wonder, pure joy of the human elements; Antony Hopkins as William Parish brings his years of experience to this character and reflects the perfect business man whose life is out of control and his health is paying the price of his success, and Claire Forlani as Susan Parish the character who is in the middle and does not know what is really happening, she is just a victim of this game. The dialog of this movie is very interesting and sometimes it gets to be scary especially at the beginning of the movie when the death calls Bill to play his last card and then throughout the movie the way death's voice tells them what to do. This dialog puts the audience in a situation where everyone realizes how difficult would be to have a conversation with the death. I am sure nobody knows how to handle it. Lighting in the movie is fantastic with a lovely golden glow that goes by the hand with the soundtrack of Thomas Newman ""What a Wonderful World"" adding an extra depth to this movie. Music truly enhances the movie captivating and enhancing it. The mixture of the piano and orchestra builds up to an inspirational and emotional pull. The cinematography of the film was well thought out and extremely picturesque. This is the kind of movie that after you watch it you want to re-watch it more and more times. I absolutely recommend this movie not only for the message it leaves to the audience but also for the outstanding work done combining technology and technique to make the essence of the film come to life.

"coco-121","10","5","7","3 March 2007"," One of my all-time favorites
","Taken from a 1920s play, ""Death Takes a Holiday,"" the concept of ""Death"" (as if it is an entity) taking human form so that it/he can find out why life is preferred over death is an interesting one. This modern version is much richer than the 1934 movie with Frederic March. This was the first movie where I discovered that Brad Pitt really can act. The living character he plays in the beginning is the sort of character he always plays... kinda goofy, getting by on his good looks. But when he reappears as Death, his movements, posture and language are completely transformed; his speech patterns and enunciation are calm, controlled and powerful; his eyes are sharp and focused. There is no doubt that a different ""soul"" is in that body. The pauses before he speaks, as he evaluates the question before dispensing a one-word answer, are brilliant. The first time he tastes peanut butter; the moments when Susan brushes up close to him; I thought he did an exquisite interpretation of someone experiencing sensations for the first time. What I enjoyed most about this movie is that, when Death decides to gain a deeper understanding of Life, he carefully chooses a person of exceptional character to show him around. Even though most of the time Death is just taking it all in, every now and then, when Anthony Hopkins's character challenges him, Death snaps back to remind William who is in charge. Pitt did an amazing job. Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor were wonderful, and it goes without say that Anthony Hopkins is brilliant. The story is very rewarding and will leave you with a good feeling."

"Pewterhills","10","5","7","17 May 2006"," A Film, not a Movie
","So many of us enter theaters to be entertained. To laugh. To cry. To relax. We go to escape from the cares and responsibilities of life. Meet Joe Black is not what we expect. Filled with the best actors of the day, we expect the usual entertainment, but Meet Joe Black is anything but usual. We are forced to step into an unfamiliar arena. Things look the same, but we find ourselves forced to deal with the issue none of us wants to think about, let alone contemplate deeply, and certainly not something we expect to see on film. Meet Joe Black is among my top twelve favorites. It's slow pace is unfamiliar to Americans used to instant gratification, and though Brad Pitt's finely sculpted face is easy on the eyes, many viewers lack the patience to absorb the films content. I wish they would try. A few lines are insipid. The 'multiply times infinity' makes me gag, but the scene where Pitt tastes peanut-butter for the first time is positively brilliant, and should be studied by all actors hoping for a film career. The shifts from high drama to low comedy are subtle, and you don't notice many of them until you have watched the DVD version several times. What critics point to as flaws, I find to be some of the best parts of the film. Thomas Newman's music is masterful, each performance superb. What Martin Brest did was release his Director's Cut in theaters. Many viewers failed to spend the time needed to absorb and enjoy it. A pity."

","So many people have complained about the length of this movie. What were all these people going to do with the `offending' 45 minutes? Save the world? Find a cure for cancer--or even bunions?<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have the pacing of Moesha (whom I admire) but why should it? To use a sports analogy, it's more like a baseball than football or basketball. It unravels at its own pace. It provides respite, not competition, to our chaotic environs.<br/><br/>I have had the opportunity to observe a few of the Robert Parishes of the world. They are much more complicated men than how they are portrayed in Hollywood projects. This movie daringly casts a wealthy man as a deeply moral rather than corrupt.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins trumpets why life is to be treasured and death despised. Why the person for you might NOT be the one right under your nose, but rather the person you have yet to really meet. That it's worth it to wait for the special somebody who makes your life more vibrant and you a better person to boot. In a world fascinated with the macabre and marketed to the ordinary, such messages are sorely needed.<br/><br/>Being a member of the `Y' chromosome sex, I cannot truly be a Brad Pitt fan. But I must say he did a fine job and had great chemistry with the rest of the cast, all of whom were first-rate.

"murrayspeer","9","9","15","19 May 2006"," A Beautiful And Melodious 'Romance' Movie
","I remember that when this movie came out, a lot of people were disappointed with it. The chief problem I heard was that it was long. Well, it is long, running exactly three hours to the end of the credits. But I find that the length allowed me to achieve some 'distance' from the events that began the story, so that when the ending arrived, it wasn't so fresh - in other words we as viewers have been taken on a journey.<br/><br/>And what a journey! We are treated to a warm and insightful examination of what it means to love. The love of a father for his daughters, and between the characters of Susan (the always-stunning Claire Forlani) and Joe (the equally gorgeous Brad Pitt), are the main focus of the story, but we are also treated to a very special moment as Jeffrey Tambor's character (a corporate ""loser"" with an ill-fitting suit and unfortunate facial hair) shares the joy of his relationship with his neurotic wife (the wonderful Marcia Gay Harden). There are also hints of fraternal, platonic love among Joe, his ersatz guide (Anthony Hopkins), and his son-in-law, Tambor.<br/><br/>This is not an immature or simple love, either. The film deals tenderly with questions of responsibility and power, self-giving and fidelity. I am a huge fan of stories in which a person simply and confidently ""is who they are"" and forces others to react, think, and make decisions. There are several moments in this movie when Joe follows Lewis Carroll's great advice, ""When in doubt, don't just do something. Stand there."" There is an entire conversation with Susan in which he says nothing, but it is not one-sided, because she is forced to think about what she's saying. (Another example of a film where someone forces others to react and grow, simply by being himself, is ""Life As A House."")<br/><br/>One of the problems with the initial release of this film may have been the theatrical trailer, which portrays a fun, humorous, and 'jaunty' Rom-Com with a slight metaphysical twist. People who went expecting to see that kind of movie would certainly be disappointed. The metaphysical content is more than slight (Joe is the personification of Death), and the movie never becomes fun or jaunty. What it is, is touching, intelligent, and utterly romantic in the best sense of the word.<br/><br/>On the negative side, it is difficult to identify with the lifestyle of the characters (Hopkins is an unimaginably wealthy media mogul) and I found the sheer opulence and excessiveness of their surroundings to be distracting at times. However, it does make for great eye-candy on the screen, and the actors are more than able to bring their characters to life; none of them are dilettante, and Hopkins brings an elegance and self-awareness to the ""rich man"" stereotype.<br/><br/>And speaking of stereotypes, the only antagonist in the film (Jake Weber as Hopkins' corporate right-hand and Susan's would-be love-interest) ends up a two-dimensional and utterly unsympathetic character who is incapable of the kind of love displayed by the people around him. It's a disappointing caricature in a movie filled with deeply explored archetypal characters. The filmmakers had an opportunity to demonstrate that all people have subtle, nuanced personalities, but there is none of that with Weber's role. On the other hand, Weber does a fine job with what he was given, and it is an interesting example of how an immature or self-interested person will attempt to sabotage the well-being of others rather than allow them to change and grow.<br/><br/>This is an unusual movie that has not developed a cult following, which means it is probably destined to be overlooked by both the mainstream and the fringe movie fan, which is unfortunate. If it had been better marketed (the trailer is a criminal misrepresentation of the movie) it might have a higher profile today. At any rate, if you are a fan of careful, thoughtful, and emotionally mature storytelling, I fully recommend this movie to your perusal. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have.<br/><br/>9/10"

","For anyone who has ever wondered about the true definition of love, this movie is it. It is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. But it is also trust, responsibility and not hurting the object of your love. It is sacrifice. Instead of taking Susan with him, Joe leaves her behind with the promise that she would always have what she found in the coffee shop. Joe's metamorphosis from a selfish, naive being into something of a hero, and his relationship with Bill and his family is truly amazing.<br/><br/>The prolonged love scene is functional in portraying naive and innocent Joe's first sexual experience. There is no nudity and it is done in good taste.<br/><br/>Favourite quote: Bill: Should I be afraid? Joe: Not a man like you."

","In my case, it was ""later"". In my harried work-every-day years - so many of them ! - I had never heard of this movie. Had I not been discussing movies I had recently purchased with a postal clerk, in an office I had used for thirty-five of those years,I would never have discovered it: she told me about it, without giving one hint of its content. I am one of those persons who can be told the entire plot without it becoming a spoiler for me. It was the look on her face when she told me, ""I really liked it,"" that gave me the intuition it was something special. She had seen it on cable-TV; I bought it on eBay, without hesitation. A movie-a-night is my passion, so I watched it the very day it came to me. I wasn't fifteen minutes into it when I became aware it WAS something special. I'm not certain I understood too much about it after my first viewing: I may have seen ""Death Takes a Holiday"", but I don't remember having seen it. I'm certainly old enough to have seen the original release.<br/><br/>I have viewed it several times, the last half of it only minutes ago. I have read approximately half of the fifty-five pages of commentaries posted here. I read so few unfavorable ones, which I dismissed without a second thought. I agree with every favorable comment - as varied as they are, each expressing differently their passion for the film - and have learned so much I wasn't sure I understood about the story, from those comments. I totally agree it was made with extreme dedication by everyone who took part in bringing it to an audience starved for classic movie-making.<br/><br/>The combination of Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani - who give their entire souls to this script - is dynamite, plus sumptuous scenery full of very talented people who make this film the masterpiece it is. How gratifying it is to read the glowing comments written by people who know, or recognize, what classic movies are about. Many of the piano-sketches are of a diabolic nature, but played with sweetness.<br/><br/>It needs the full three hours of its length to let love-impossible-love flower. We can only soulfully hope its message is trumpeted around the world, that even The Angel of Death cannot overcome the ultimately consuming power of true love. I am so happy to share the mesmerizing splendor of this unforgettable film. Our love for it will keep it alive."

","The old Paramount classic Death Takes A Holiday gets a stylish turn of the 21st century remake, Meet Joe Black with Brad Pitt as the grim reaper himself taking a sabbatical to experience what he deprives everyone of, ultimately. The story has been updated from Italy during World War I to America in the new age of information.<br/><br/>The guy who benefits for a short while is multimillionaire media tycoon Anthony Hopkins who is approaching his 65th birthday. He's a widower with two daughters, Marcia Gay Harden who is married to Jeffrey Tambor and Clare Forlani who's in love with love. In fact at the beginning of the film Clare who is a doctor has a chance meeting with Brad Pitt just before he's rundown in a busy New York street and the pale horseman takes over his body.<br/><br/>It's a good thing Hopkins got this reprieve because there's some real nasty double-dealing taking place in his firm. His young right hand man, Jake Weber, is looking to affect a merger with another conglomerate that would ruin all that Hopkins has built in his life. But Weber of course hasn't the slightest idea who Hopkins's new ally is. Let alone the resources he can bring to bear.<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black is a fine film which has a lot to say about the meaning of life and how important it is to use that time on earth in mortal form to become the best you can be. Pitt and Hopkins have very good chemistry and Webber is one of the slimier villains ever put on film.<br/><br/>And see how it all works out for everyone in the end. In fact that's the real message of Meet Joe Black, it all does work out in the end."

""Legends of the Fall"" indisputably on my all time top ten list notwithstanding, I would love to see these two really given the reigns to see where they want to go.<br/><br/>The rest of the luxurious cast and sets are well worth watching in themselves.

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>I liked ""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) when i first saw it back in 1999 - i was 15 at the time. Today i watched it for a second time - i'm 34 now, so its been almost 20 years - and i still liked it the way i did first time. ""Meet Joe Black"" is by any mean a great movie - it is not. Nor its a classic, but what it is a superbly looking 3 hours movie escapism. It has great premise, great story, very solid acting by my all time favorite Sir Anthony Hopkins and very good performance by always reliable Brad Pitt. Claire Forlani on the other hand did not create very memorable character in my opinion, although she looked absolutely stunning in this movie - you can't take your eyes of her. Production values of this movie were stunning - cinematography by a future 2 times Oscar winner Emmanuel Lubezki, production design by a legendary Dante Ferretti - this movie looks absolutely stunning - no wonder it cost almost 100 mil. to create.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Meet Joe Black"" isn't a great movie, because it has some issues with screenplay (no a great premise), some corny dialog and situations and some scenes that do drag. But other then that - here is fantasy / romance movie that is marvelous to look at. Good movie."
"LukeFaulknerPianist","10","2","2","16 June 2019"," Great movie, in spite of mawkish ending.
","Captivating performances all round, great direction, and piquant music conspire to tell an original story that takes you on an enthralling and often humorous journey. Whilst you learn early on that two of the principal characters must die, the film keeps you distracted with humour and a developing plot. The build up to the zenith is elegantly crafted such that, once your attention is drawn back to the impending demise of Anthony and Brad, your laughter is replaced by sorrow. I feel, if the story ended at this point, it would be one of the greatest movies ever. However, it doesn't. You get a cheap ending in which Brad (the original) comes back to life, presumably to ensure you don't leave the theatre in tears.
Still, the first 95% of this film is so ridiculously good, it deserves a 10."

"bob the moo","Null","9","16","4 February 2002"," Could have been charming and light  instead it's mostly tiresome, overlong and occasionally terrible
","Media magnate William Parrish is approaching his 65th birthday.  While dealing with his business problems he advises his youngest daughter Susan that she must find true love.  She meets a young man in a coffee shop and falls for his charms but leaves without him.  When the young man is hit by a bus and killed, Death decides to use his body to visit earth.  He postpones the death of Parrish in return for experiencing life.  However his influence causes an impact on Parrish's business and on his daughter.<br/><br/>This is a rework of 1934's `Death Takes a Holiday' - four writers worked tirelessly to take that short charmer and spin it into a ponderous three hour slog.  The story is simple enough - Death comes to earth, falls in love, makes friends, is a fish out of water but must eventually go back' - however it's seriously stretched and delivered in very slow chunks.  The various strands (the business confrontation, the romance etc) don't sit well together and it's like the writers all took turns rather than working together.  At the start it is quite charming, but the longer it goes on, the less you care and the less charming it becomes.<br/><br/>Why did it have to be so long?  There are so many elements of the story that could have been trimmed down.  So many scenes could have been told in a shorter time or removed totally.  It feels like nothing they shot ended up on the cutting room floor.  For example, Pitt shares several scenes (total about 10 minutes) with an elderly Jamaican woman, these scenes don't add anything to the film: more than that they are terrible - Pitt does a horrible, horrible patwa accent.  Surely the editor should have removed these on quality alone!<br/><br/>If this had been good then it wouldn't matter if it was so long - but there's only enough to last for 2 hours at most.  That's 60 minutes worth of filler that could have been lost.  The performances are mixed, but are mainly as heavy and unwieldy as the film itself.  Pitt starts well - his human' role is really charming and I thought that he was already Death and thought he'd be that way for the whole film.  However when he becomes death he is totally flat and lifeless - obviously that's how Death would be, but it makes him really dull and wastes the charm that has made him a star.  His Jamaican accent is absolutely terrible and just shows he has no judgement. Forlani holds her own well beside an experienced cast but the romance between her and death is unbelievable due to Pitt's stony performance. Hopkins is good throughout and shows Pitt up to be a star rather than an actor.  The support is mostly good - but that old Jamaican lady has got to go!<br/><br/>The film is far too long - at one point I thought it was winding up and that the end must be 10 minutes away - it was winding up (and did what I thought it would) but instead of 10 minutes it took 45!  Such luxurious running times should only be permitted to films that can sustain them.<br/><br/>Overall this could have been a charming little film.  Instead it buries that charm in a three hour running time that it can't sustain.  I liked it but I wished it would end after the first 120 minutes.  Somewhere out there - it is still going!"
"tedg","Null","7","12","9 March 2002"," In Another Body
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>This film really surprised me because it drew me in, and I'm a pretty hard case. Plus, I really hate heavyhanded direction; Brest and Pacino in `Scent of a Woman' was a sledgehammer.<br/><br/>What happened here was a sweet spot in casting. Hopkins is a selfish internal actor. When he acts, he acts alone, working the words not the other actors, the story or the environment. Pitt is the opposite: he works the other actors, tries to extend into the space around him, tries to work the multilayered angle. That multilayering is written into the part: he gets to play Brad Pitt (to get the opening boxoffice) playing an angel, playing a dead guy, playing the original inhabitant of the body. Actors love this stuff, at least the intelligent ones do.<br/><br/>So the combo of Hopkins and Pitt works. Everything else is scenery, so much so that when we have the sex scene, the camera stays on Pitt's face! Brad is still not up to the task (as are Penn, Moore, Blanchett) but he is getting there, and taking lots of chances.<br/><br/>This risk maps well onto the risk that the angel of death is taking. And the soul-in-body play maps well to us entering the emotional space of the story. That the family was so storybook appealing helped this pull. Also the story being about one film entity ""taking over"" another is a clever extra.<br/><br/>Any film worth watching is worth watching for a least three hours, so I did not at all mind the meditative approach to watching this develop. All the laborious mechanics of tying up plot ends at the end were a little trying. But I thought the staging was very good, if overly static.<br/><br/>The ending was particularly visual and apt. The idea of the presentation up til then is that Pitt's presence is like one of those starbursts -- all tendrils. So the multiply-accelerating explosions were a very effective climax -- possibly the best fireworks display in all filmdom (though there was one firework in `Lord of the Rings' that was tops in that category).<br/><br/>Nothing (except perhaps water) is more cinematic than fireworks."
"Vartiainen","Null","6","10","2 July 2017"," You'll be begging for death at the end of this travesty
","In Meet Joe Black Brad Pitt plays Death who has decided, after eons of existing, to experience the human existence through an unhappy car crash victim. As his guide he chooses a filthy rich media mogul played by Anthony Hopkins. Because that's a fine sample of humanity right there. But, it just so happens that the mogul has a feisty daughter played by the lovely Claire Forlani. Hijinks do indeed ensue.<br/><br/>This film has problems. The actors themselves are fine, yes. The technical aspects are fine, yes. Even the story is not half bad and would normally allow for an hour or two of lighthearted entertainment. Once again it's the execution that trumps all that.<br/><br/>Because this film is ghastly boring, unimaginative, unbearable to watch and just an all-around mess. And almost all of that stems from the fact that it's Three! Hours! Long! At most it should be two, and even that would be tedious with the amount of story on display here. I mean, a firework is fun right? The shooting, the buildup of the climb and then the main thing, the explosion. Imagine all that taking ten minutes instead of seconds. That's how this movie felt to me. And why is it so long? Because apparently the director doesn't know the word ""cut"", leading most scenes to go on a minute or two too long. Including fifteen minutes dedicated to peanut butter and a sex scene that has us staring at Brad Pitt's bulging eyes for another fifteen minutes. Oh I'm sure the scene lasted for a couple of minutes at best, but it sure felt like an eternity.<br/><br/>It also doesn't help that the film is positively diabetic. Especially the ending, which tries so hard to be emotional and heartfelt that I feel sorry for it. Because it isn't. It's manipulative, forced and banal. I'm sorry, ending, that's the truth.<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black has its fans and in some sick manner I can even see why. Its actors are capable, the story has that sugary quality to it that appeals to some and it is professionally made, aside from the length of it. Personally I died a little watching it. As in I'm three hours closer to death and I have nothing to show for it."

","""Joe Black"" is a bit entertaining, and I can understand why many users commented on how much they loved this movie, as I do agree that it had a decent cast, great musical score, good cinematography, but that isn't all that makes a good movie. This is one of those movies that had all those great things on the surface, plus an interesting premise (death personified, and in love), but no substance to back it up. During the whole 3 hours, I was waiting for the movie to really start. When a movie is built on a premise as profound and abstract as the personification of death, one would expect it to have an equally profound and abstract message at the end, but in my opinion ""Meet Joe Black"" fails. The message about love is the same as every other movie (""these things have a way of working themselves out""), and the message about life is basically to live and die without regrets. Wow. Amazing. *insert sarcasm* I also had a hard time buying Death's love for Susan...her own feelings are understandable, as she thinks she's looking at the same man she met in the coffee shop, but he hardly knows anything about her or even spends any time with her, and the next thing we know, they're having sex.<br/><br/>So basically, if you like long, dramatic but pointless movies, then you'll love ""Meet Joe Black."" Brad Pitt fans, stay away from this one, and just go watch ""Legends of the Fall"" and ""Fight Club"" again...Anthony Hopkins fans, stick to ""Silence of the Lambs."""

","Maybe it's the title that turns people off to this film, which is unfortunate, for this movie has the incomparable Anthony Hopkins,a luminous Claire Forlani, Brad Pitt showing some good acting chops, gorgeous production values and a glorious musical score. I was captivated by this film and its subject matter. I didn't care about its length. It was like curling up with a good book. Besides, I have become annoyed with all of the fast cutting of films these days with scenes of six seconds or so. Here, the camera lingers longer on these actors, who often take a minute or so to convey their thoughts/emotions--just like in real life. A good story will captivate viewers/readers. Death decides to ""vacation"" on earth and be guided by Anthony Hopkins' character, Bill Parrish, who is upright, smart, successful and wealthy. What better tour guide? And his fabulous NYC house with an indoor pool at the top: I want it! Death inadvertently finds that he digs Earth and its pleasures. Pitt conveys these nascent emotions very powerfully. Yes, there are some plot questions that one has at the end, but the overall story themes are the focus--don't go through life without having loved deeply. I've never seen the original or its remake, but, if you want a film that's a gorgeously made, thought-provoking ""what if,"" check this one out."
"Rob_Taylor","7","3","4","11 September 2006"," Brad Pitt gets run over....what's not to like?
","Well...OK, I guess there are a few things.<br/><br/>For one, the movie is a loooong one. Most of this is due to the ""meaningful"" pauses between exchanges of dialogue. Sometimes this is actually teeth-grittingly painful to be subjected to and you want to almost scream at them to say something, anything, instead of staring at each other.<br/><br/>The second thing that detracted from the film was Anthony Hopkins. He's a fine actor, to be sure, but here he seemed almost totally bored with proceedings. Some of his lines are mind-numbingly delivered. Sometimes he actually seems to be struggling to remember them. He's like someone's old grandad that was asked to fill in when the real actor failed to show.<br/><br/>Pitt is his usual wooden self, though here that actually works in his favour as he comes across even more oddly than usual.<br/><br/>But despite these failings, the movie still succeeds in its romantic notion that Death can learn love and that things kind of turn out for the best in the end.<br/><br/>In short, it is worth a watch at least once. But I don't think you'll get much more out of it by sitting through it more than that. Not convinced? Well, my partner decided to watch it on TV the other night, adamant that she hadn't yet seen it, only to admit about half-way through that she recalled it from a few years back.<br/><br/>If that doesn't tell you how unmemorable most of it is, I don't know what will."

If you are a die hard romantic, a Brad Pitt or Anthony Hopkins fan, it is a must see. To have such simple dialog, so many moments where it was just the music that set the tone, it was simply outstanding. But, then again, you really have to understand the tone and setting for 3 hours to be appealing. Much like the Hannibal Lector series, Anthony's roll commands your attention and the dance between his character and Brad Pitt (as Death) is simple yet the dialog is powerful. I know everyone won't agree with the comments posted, but this really is a movie worth having in your collection."

Without giving away to much, i would like to say some things that made this enjoyable to me, and if i do give away too much i hope they warned you that i might spoil the movie for you. The way Brad Pitt becomes Death is great. He goes from exciting and nice flirty guy that meets up with some girl in a coffee shop, to a clueless person after he is hit by a bunch of cars. because after the cars hit him he becomes the voice that was in Hopkins's head..aka death. When he arrives at the house and Hopkins's daughter is the girl from the coffee shop and she is stunned to see him and he is clueless as to who she is, and this sets up the good plot line. This plot also creates some good humor and a little bit of a love story.

( I saw it on AMC this morning) I am actually going to make it a point to purchase this movie. This film got a lot of bad reviews when it was released, and even until today, but I think the ones who gave it criticism were looking too technically at the film and not watching it for mere enjoyment. If you watch the movie with your heart and not with your eyes you may get to experience one of the most profound and moving films ever made I believe. I won't bother to get into details about the finer points of the movie, I believe the ones who watched it as I did, understand the feeling that this movie invokes. This will go on my shelf with ""Schindler's List, It's a Wonderful Life, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Imitation of Life, Godfather 1 and 2, Legend, The Heart of Me, etc"" If you know these movies and also appreciate them for the feelings they invoke and not necessarily the reviews and the poor acting (in some opinions)or whatever technical ""nonsense"" these critics use to view these films, then you will understand why I must own this film. Do yourself a favor, watch this movie with ""heart wide open""."

","We didn't watch the XL Super Bowl. Instead we watched ""Meet Joe Black"" for the first time. It was such great acting by both Anthony Hopkins and Brat Pitt, their best ever. Great plot and a bit different than the usual movie. It had a plot. Not like so many movies now, with car crashes, special affects and filthy language. It takes thought to write a plot, it's easier to do the other movies. Brat Pitt had to be two people or two acting roles. The lst person was an outgoing personality, the 2nd person was a slower, more serious acting. You could see he is truly an ""actor"" not just a ""pretty face."" My wife, of course, loves him even if he couldn't act."

","I've just seen the 3-hour version of Meet Joe Black for the second time. It improves with re-viewing. What I find amazing about this story, and about the way it has been executed on film is its gorgeously rendered mix of: subtle yet passionate performances (all of them, including supporting cast), perfectly chosen and applied music, idealistic but utterly believable characters whom you wish you knew personally and whom you can care about, and the ""production values"" (rich yet subdued cinematography ~ in particular the graceful, gradually unfolding, almost spiritual PACE that is so well geared to this story, rather than to the ""attention span of a flea"" unfortunately created within so many movie viewers by their having been bombarded with 30-second TV ads for their entire lives. (READING an actual book REALLY takes a lot of time too, this is called ""literature."") Hence, most likely, the complaints about this movie being ""too long,"" which I find utterly baffling. In the hands of a lesser director and producer, the special effects geeks might also have slimed their way into this production and removed all traces of subtlety. Hooray ~ this DIDN'T happen, either. And, since the major characters are all gradually revealed as being awake, conscious, perceptive beings (as well as being complicated flawed human beings) ~ none of them are forced to fit into the false American ""belief"" that bigger and faster are automatically better (they aren't). In summary, this is a delicious meal of a movie for grownups who love a good story and who don't cynically believe that idealism, love and spirituality are ""boring."""

I liked the relation of Joe Black with the old woman the most. She was the one that knows the real life. May be that's why she understood that he is the angel of death...

","I've seen this movie more than 10 times and I haven't get enough of it!<br/><br/>
Death (Brad Pitt) decides to spend a few days as a mere mortal and his target is a wealthy men (Anthony Hopkins). Little does he know that he'll fall hard for Suzan, the daughter of his victim. Now, he is confronted with a dilemma: to listen to his heart (and love Suzan for the rest of his mortal life), or to listen to reason (and to become once again the angel of death).<br/><br/>The end lives you a bitter-sweet taste in your mouth. One one hand you're happy that he didn't take her with him (she would have died), on the other hand you cannot help but feel sorry for him, because he has to live her, to go back and continue his lonely existence.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is great in the role of Death. He is, as Suzan says: ""shy in the most seductive way and yet powerful"" When we think at Death we don't picture it as a blond handsome guy with a stunning smile. A men who likes peanut butter more than anything and who has the candor of a child. And this contrast is what makes the movie great.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is, as always, at his best. A elegant gentleman who has the wisdom of his age. A father who love his daughters more than anything. Who dares to face Death when he realizes that He wants to take Suzan with Him.<br/><br/>Claire Forlani (Suzan) is perfect for this role. She knows nothing about Joe and yet she falls for him. She accepts him without any questions. I'll never forget th moment when she realizes who he is. The look on her face when she accepts the inevitable: ""you're Joe!"" she says smiling through her tears.<br/><br/>Ok, enough! As you can see I'm a sucker for this type of movies: a touch of mystery, a touch of love, a touch of supernatural and I'm hooked!"

And I regret that, truly.  <br/><br/>Pitt, Hopkins, Forlani, Harden, Tambor, Howard and that exquisite Jamaican woman, Lois Kelly-Miller were engaging and brought us a memorable experience.

","""Meet Joe Black"" is one of those films that will make you smile from start to finish. With talented stars, a script rich in plot and characters, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie to watch.  <br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of an earlier film called ""Death Takes A Holiday."" In ""Meet Joe Black"" death takes human form as he comes to see the world, with the assistance of the body he is going to take.  Anthony Hopkins adds his superstar status as the fiesty father, which he plays so convincingly.<br/><br/>There is only one result that can come from inserting two of the most talented actors in a film that has great writing. Hopkins stars alongside Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani in one of the most romantic, intelligent and character driven movies I have seen in a long time. Excitement and pleasure were two feelings that made my heart skip a beat. <br/><br/>When I heard Hopkins would be a part of the film, I immediately thought the amount of credibility he would give toward ""Meet Joe Black."" Hopkins is the type of actor like Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman whose mere presence on film will alert the viewer that they will be watching a great film. Hopkins brought integrity, intelligence, and honesty to this role.<br/><br/>
""Meet Joe Black"" is truly a movie filled with romance, excitement, joy, happiness, and sorrow. Brad Pitt's approach was enjoyable to watch as he seemed to pull it off with innocence. It was like he is learning everything from scratch, though he may know more than he is letting on. Also, Pitt's performance is like a mirror image to that of Hopkins.<br/><br/>Forlani is a vision to behold in ""Meet Joe Black"" as her beauty radiates off the screen with such heat. Forlani showcases her true ability to capture the essence of her character and portray it with innocence and sincerity. Audiences will enjoy the surprises Forlani has in store for them.<br/><br/>

"nicardo","1","12","27","30 November 1998"," Whattaya know, Joe?
","This could have been a really good film if there had been some consistency with the character of Death. He is powerful and all-knowing when need be, and totally clueless the rest of the time. Death's work is to end every human life at their appointed time, but he has no idea what he's ending. So, for reasons unknown he has the time and ability to find out. Pitt is handsome and charming as a doomed young man in a coffee shop, and handsome, boring and charmless as Death. Hopkins can do great work even in a flawed film. Forlani is believable and beautiful, despite looking as though she is about to fall asleep every five to ten minutes. Not a good quality for a character in a nearly three hour movie. Harden and Tambor (both wonderful talents long before Larry Sanders existed) do some top-quality film work. The message seems to be that family is most important, lots and lots of money is really good, and that death and taxes are still inevitable. I think they also ask the cinematic question, ""Just how long can we get away with keeping the camera focused on a well-groomed Brad Pitt in total silence?"""

Multiple times I had considered walking out in the middle, but instead waited to see if there was some payoff in watching it through to the end. There wasn't. And those are hours of my life I will never get back!!! I thought this film contained some very poor acting (with the exception perhaps of Anthony Hopkins -- but even then, it was probably not his best considering the acting quality of those he was working with). Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani were irritating throughout. And, I really didn't understand why this movie had to be so long.

","After 20 years of moviegoing, I finally found it - the really really bad movie, the worst I ever have seen. The story was good for 45 minutes - not for three extremely boring hours which ironically made the theater collect an additional charge for over-length. And that was what I got: over-length. Much of over-length for a few Deutschmarks, in that sense it was a good deal.<br/><br/>The story of Death coming to Earth as a person bears many possibilities - none of them was used. There are many long scenes with dialogues like ""who are you"" ""I'm Joe Black"" ""but who are you?"" taking five minutes' time. Sometimes even nothing was spoken, and the poor actors had to grimace endlessly to make it through the scenes. You see beautiful people in beautiful locations - but that does not make a movie! With 30 frames per second, you *are* allowed to move!<br/><br/>I never leave a movie after half the time, but this time I almost did, if not for my friends with whom I watched this thing. Finally, we just thought ""F*** her, and let us go!"". And what the heck were the scenes with the black woman in the wheelchair speaking a strange language (in the German version, it sounded like Dutch) *without subtitles* ??? For ten minutes, I didn't understand a word, and nobody helped!<br/><br/>This was bad. Worse than anything else. Even after bad movies I usually think, ok, I've seen it, I can talk about it.

First of all, it's directed with such love and and an eye for detail that you can't take your eyes off it. The art direction, cinematography, musical score and staging are blended into an artistic triumph. The music by Thomas Newman is especially brilliant; haunting and sinuous.<br/><br/>The cast is so good, it's hard to believe the movie was received so disparagingly by critics. Brad Pitt's impersonation of the devil inhabiting a young man's body is pitch perfect in every way. He gets everything right; a child like innocence of first experiences. Anthony Hopkins has never been better. Claire Forlani says more with facial expression than a thousand lines. Her love scenes with Pitt are unique. They're not only erotic, but deep and soulful in all the right ways. Marcia Gay Harden is perfect and Jeffrey Tambor as Quince gives a delectable portrait of a character we've all met and known from time to time.<br/><br/>This is a ""feel good"" movie, so it was automatically dismissed by half the critics out there. It not only makes you feel good about life and death, but it makes you contemplate a lot of the important, simple issues of our existence. <br/><br/>A classic in every way that will be loved by the lucky souls who really understand it."

","To start with I would like to underline that this is not a 'deep' film, it's just filmed in a way to make some people believe this i.e. dramatic music, long pauses and an overload of tears. But the main reason I have rated this film 1/10 is because there are too many moments that either don't make sense or make me question what in the actual hell!?? Some of these moments are as follows: 1. When Brad Pitt dies after getting hit by a car and comes back as death later on, does he just suddenly get up and walk out of a morgue or funeral!? And what must the family/friends/police be thinking of the missing body!? And in coming back as death he still has no purpose!? 2. How does the lead female fall head over heels in love with 'death' guy when he can now barely talk normally, say's the most freakishly strange things, acts like a stalker and walks around sucking a spoon!!? He basically makes zero effort and she's all over him (forces him to have sex later on)... is she really that shallow? 3. The film is trying to make me feel sorry for the lead female, yet she is shallow, cheats on her boyfriend and is the 'favourite' and spoilt kid of a millionaire who she takes full advantage of!! Ergghh ye nice try! 4. The film is trying to make me feel sorry for Hopkins, but he doesn't give a damn about his company and the people in it, sets up his daughter with death while her boyfriend is running their business, openly favours one child over another!! (something no human should ever do!!) and after the daughter he 'favours least' puts the effort into organising the birthday party of the century for him- he repays her by practically ignoring her and giving his last dance and loving words to the daughter who does sweet FA!!! I mean come on...<br/><br/>5. The film is trying to make me dislike the unlucky ex-boyfriend, but he is the one being cheated on by a girlfriend who couldn't care less, he is the one trying to save a business when he realises Hopkins has lost the plot and at the end of it all he is forced to resign for his efforts and is left with nothing!!! 6. If death knows nothing about anything, how can he be dressed to perfection in a suit every day and have the most stylishly perfected haircut and perform like a professional porn star in the bedroom!? Oh yea, and have the emotion to know what love is...<br/><br/>7. At the end of the film, death decides to go away with Hopkins and bring Brad Pitt back to life... yet his purpose is death, he's not called life is he? And if he could do this, why didn't he bring Hopkins back instead- who he grew to love or the old woman at the hospital!? But after all I have said here, this film has obviously had the last laugh on me, as it made watch until the end (3 hours) and I have wasted even more time writing this.."

","Many films get made with such passion and craft but get simply released at the wrong time. We look upon Classic films, and forget that many of these great pictures flopped in their era. Neither the critics nor the audiences grasped the intent and strength of those stories and the way in which those stories were told. But years later through cable, VHS, DVD, and Blu-Ray we've been given an opportunity to reappraise films like ""Meet Joe Black"".<br/><br/>This film should've been a no-brainer. With up-and-comer Brad Pitt and Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins holding the leads audiences should've run to the cinemas. But, alas, a three hour long love story/drama proved too daunting for a 1998 audience.<br/><br/>The story is a simple yet elegant fairytale. Death (Pitt) takes the body of a man and needs a guide (Hopkins) through a life away from his responsibilities. And along the way Death finds what he's been missing, love.<br/><br/>This is old-school film making. When a director was allowed to take his time to tell a story, to let his characters and dialog breathe. The actors are all superb. The photography, the design, and the costumes are top-notch. The settings are absolutely grand. And the score by Thomas Newman is one of the best he's ever done. And there is no hint of digital trickery. The film could've easily been made in Hollywood's golden era.<br/><br/>And I feel as more people see this, and recognize the timelessness of it's themes of love and life, it will become the classic it deserves to be.

In the end, every possible permutation of saying goodbye is done.<br/><br/>It was also terribly predictable and convenient at parts. eg. (semi-spoiler) The boyfriend turns to ex-boyfriend to the Satan of the film to try to give it some extra depth.<br/><br/>On a positive note, there was nothing wrong with the acting but it was a waste of Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>Still, 1/10"

","This movie was terrible. I kept waiting for it to get good, but it never did. And the ending was the worst ever. The ending brought the climax of a dull film to a an even duller and less believable ending. I want my 3 hours back! This movie lacked believability completely! The total calmness of Anthony Hopkins was not believable to me. Brad Pitt trying to come off as some kind of robotic being that has no idea what things are, or what people think, yet he has been around forever. I had heard that this movie was good, and I was bored so i figured I'd give it a shot. It had some sweet moments, and some sentimental and reflective moments, but were so minutely developed and so short compared to all the filler that dragged this movie out to 3 hours. If you are bored and have absolutely nothing to do, then this is your movie."

","Both my daughter and I loved this movie. We've watched it over and over many times and will watch it again. We do not get tired of it. I've seen many of Brad Pitt's movies and I believe he puts himself totally into character.<br/><br/>Brad's portrayal of death becoming human was like an innocent child learning for the first time. For instance tasting peanut butter and describing it, and listening to the characters interacting with each other and interpreting their reactions when discussing the party or business, then falling and feeling what love is like, and his questioning of everything. His character helps William Parrish, Hopkin's character, realize what is really important in life. <br/><br/>I would not change the cast at all. The scenery, fireworks, and music were all fantastic. I really didn't notice how long the movie was. It puts you in sort of a dream state and I really didn't want it to end. I'm a dreamer, what can I say."

SO MANY times during this picture, I found myself yelling ""Get on with it!"". So often it ground almost to a halt, seemed like a rehearsal with all parties hung over.

"paul-nemecek","8","2","3","8 July 2018"," Meet Joe Black
","In the recent thriller The Edge, Anthony Hopkins played a wealthy businessman who is transformed by a harrowing encounter with death. In Meet Joe Black, Anthony Hopkins plays Bill, a similar character confronting similar themes, but with a very different twist. Here he meets Death as played by Brad Pitt. Death informs Bill that he wants to see what life is like and he wants Bill to teach him. So long as Death is interested and learning, Bill gets more time. When Bill has to introduce Death to his family at dinner, he fumbles around for a name, eventually coming up with Joe Black.<br/><br/>This is hardly the first film to depict bargains with Death. In Ingmar Bergman's Seventh Seal the allegorical figure of death (complete with shroud) is challenged to a game of chess. His intended victim hopes to forestall the inevitable. Bergman's Death character is reprised in Woody Allen's Love and Death, The Last Action Hero, and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. In Meet Joe Black we are spared the shroud since Death decided to borrow a body from one of his victims. (If you gotta' have one, might as well borrow one that looks like Brad Pitt, I guess.)<br/><br/>The real twist in this film comes in what could be taken as the sub-plot. Death falls in love with Bill's daughter Susan. Susan is involved with Drew, her father's right-hand man in the business world. Drew meanwhile is conniving at some underhanded business deals of his own. The plot takes more than a few twists and turns along the way, but in the end it is neither the plot nor the grand theme (if there is one) that makes the film engaging. Sometimes its the ride itself that makes the journey worthwhile.<br/><br/>Frankly, there are more than a few problems of plausibility here (even after we grant willing suspension of disbelief to the central premise). As one small example, Joe Black is fluent in Jamaican patois, but doesn't know how to tie a tie. The cinematography is good, but not outstanding, and the performances are no more that what we would expect under the circumstances.<br/><br/>Still in all, there were more than a few moments along the way where the audience laughed pretty hard. At one point the audience applauded (in the middle of the movie no less), and I'm sure there were more than a few smiles on more than a few occasions. By the end of the film, director Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman) has given us quite a few simple pleasures along the way. If there is a grand theme to the film, perhaps that is it . . . . it's the simple pleasures that make life good, and in the end, caring is everything."

","This is a very nice and charming romance movie, a story about media tycoon William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) who is visited by Death itself, in the form of Joe Black (Brad Pitt). His intention was to take William with him, but William's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) has met the man that Joe Black resembles and she falls in love with Joe, changing the life and death course of events.<br/><br/>More than a romance and love story, this film delves into the mystery of death, creating a suspenseful plot that I've found made the movie intriguing. While Joe's visit was to take William with him, it is interesting to see what he chooses to do throughout the course of the movie when he establishes a love connection with Susan.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good for the most part, albeit wooden at times, and there are some slow, filler scenes, but not enough for me to think the movie was boring. The set of the film, particularly the Parrish mansion, is beautiful.<br/><br/>I am not a huge fan of romance movies, but I give this one an exception as it has a mysterious and suspenseful twist to the story about love, life and death.<br/><br/>Grade B"

Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are breathtaking for they were at the highlight of their acting career. Every scene is exhaustive yet has a hint vagueness to keep the audience in a mood of suspense.

"stephenrtod","9","2","3","21 January 2013"," Mirror and Razor
","""Meet Joe Black"" is very much like many of my favorite books. I can read them often and they lose no flavor; in fact, their characters and the stories woven about them seep deeper and deeper into my own life to the extent that fiction and non-fiction intermingle.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins, one of my favorite actors, again becomes the character, Magnate Bill Parrish. Hopkins again makes it seem as if every word emanating from his lips is newly-minted as if the struggles he is undergoing well up out of threat, terror, and Ozymandias-like success.<br/><br/>Claire Forlani truly seems to be the real daughter of this business titan; I believe it is her most convincing role to date.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that much of the movie's plot takes place in the rarefied atmosphere of the biggest business on the planet, in pressurized board rooms where the fate of lives and corporations are decided like a knife fight in an alley, I continue to find more and more to relate to in this movie over the years.<br/><br/>Thomas Newman's intriguing, ethereal musical motifs are like shadows of the characters and their tentative actions in a movie about people who illustrate, in a fresh manner, the clichÃ© that money does not necessarily buy happiness; in fact, opulence makes life trickier.<br/><br/>This is especially a movie about fathers and daughters, about two very different kinds of beings who ingratiate themselves into the good graces of a father, with mixed results, because, ultimately, this movie is about various kinds of love and various kinds of life lessons.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt demonstrates that his earlier work in ""Interview with a Vampire"" was no fluke; Pitt earns my respect in a dual role, alternating from sympathetic and lovable to the obverse and then back again.<br/><br/>I think that ""Meet Joe Black"" is a film that acts as a mirror for my own life, forcing me to do quite a bit of personal self-reflection. The film also behaves very much like a razor: the dialog is sharp, cutting, peeling away layers of every character as powerful emotions buffet their lives, paring away all sorts of fronts, romantic, mercenary and societal.<br/><br/>Like some novels that I regard as old friends, stories I can savor and truly delve deeper into as I read them every year, I am a different person each time I watch ""Meet Joe Black."" The dialog, plot and all other elements never deviate, but I change as life buffets me, paring away my many fronts as I grow, learn and take risks.<br/><br/>This is an entertaining movie, but it is a very pensive film. The humor is very lightly ironical, but quite cerebral in the sense of discovering anew just what each of us truly wants in our lives, in our relationships, in our business deals and careers. The movie strongly investigates personal and professional legacies, ethics and morality.<br/><br/>Despite the high society backdrop, I found the story very much down-to-earth. The Seven Deadly Sins and the Seven Heavenly Virtues do not budge simply because the personages who grapple with and adopt these values are rich, spoiled, guileless, unaffected, or effete. This is a good people movie, especially in terms of very deep questions such as ""Who am I?"" ""Who do I truly wish to be?"" ""What do I really want from love and life?"" ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie that touched me at first viewing; and each time I watch it, it gets to me, down deep.<br/><br/>Each of us has his or her own definition of entertainment. This will not be everyone's cup of tea. Hopkins, Pitt and Forlani fans may enjoy the manner in which the script opens each actor. I can imagine each of them reading the script for the first time. I can imagine Hopkins reading it and deciding that the script would provoke from him a different set of subtle emotions, gestures and interactions in a different set of unique relationships.<br/><br/>Like a razor, the movie shaves life very close. Tomorrow and next year, I will need another shave, but the feel of the blade strikes me as quite different at 67 than it did 15 years ago when the movie came out. The film is also like a mirror, in that I find much in my own existence to think about and weigh in terms of happiness, success, expedience versus making truly authentic choices in life."

The film is majestic in every which way; from the sets to the photography,the music and the performances, are all awe inspiring to every age group.

","""Meet Joe Black"" is a very, very good and touching film "" A rare blend of emotion and intelligence"" is what Roger Ebert said of the film when it came out in 1998 on Siskel & Ebert. Gene Siskel liked the film's theme of ""love intensely and take your life seriously."" They both said that they were touched by the film.<br/><br/>The cast was terrific in their portrayals. You can't say anything wrong about how Anthony Hopkins (William Parish) acted in this film, he was phenomenal in how he portrayed an actual decent guy. The attractive Claire Forlani as Susan Parish was believable, in her role as someone who is obviously searching for love but doesn't know if she has truly found it. Brad Pitt portrays two different characters in the film, first the guy that Susan meets at the cafe and then as ""Joe Black."" He portrays ""Death"" subtly as an observer with calm and coolness about him but how is death suppose to be portrayed anyway, with a black robe and sickle? After you watch this film and ""Legend of the Fall"" (another Hopkins and Pitt collaboration) you will see how underrated of an actor Pitt is. The rest of the cast were great as well: Jeffrey Tambor (Quince) and Jake Weber as Drew, the perfect ahole! This is one of those films that touches you on a certain level where you know what it is trying to convey to you and the rest of its viewers and if you can't pinpoint what that is consciously you know it subconsciously because you think to yourself that there is something about this film that I like or that gets to me but I don't know what that is.<br/><br/>This is definitely NOT a ""CHICK FLICK""!!! if you didn't see ""Meet Joe Black"" during its theatrical release I would recommend renting or buying the DVD and seeing it in its entirety, uncut without the 20 million commercials, which probably ways heavily on the negativity that some may feel toward this production.<br/><br/>Is the film a little too long, yes three hours, but as the shortened, cut, pan and scanned versions of this film have been shown on television this may have caused confusion about the storyline or the subtleties of some of the characters such as Susan or Joe. What this means is that you need the three hours to tell the story without fault.<br/><br/>You have to watch Joe Black with a clean slate and not think of it as a ""chick flick"" because that will poison your mind about this truly wonderful film."

Keep it short and sweet. <br/><br/>I think it was the Bard who said that parting was such sweet sorrow. Unfortunately, he forgot to mention that it could be the longest, most tedious and lachrymose experience in the universe. <br/><br/>Three hours. Three wretched hours. Here is a movie paradox. It tells you that life is precious. But it takes so long about it that there's a very real chance of viewers dying before the lead character. This is a movie that invites audience participation. <br/><br/>Some directors are apt to over-indulge in human emotion and excessive sentimentality. Hollywood refers to this as 'schmaltz'. Here, it is as if human emotion had engorged to the size of a cosmic udder, and is being so vigorously milked that the bucket over-floweth and humanity risks drowning in sentiment. <br/><br/>An old bloke who is a millionaire and who has had a good life is going to die. That's sad? lucky him. he should try being homeless or living in a sink estate on social security. Those people die too, and usually a lot younger. <br/><br/>Death turns up in the form of a youthful naiveté with a peanut-butter fetish and a crush on the dying man's daughter. He doesn't understand life, but he apparently understands the tax system. He can hijack and re-animate a corpse, but he can't stop the main character dying. <br/><br/>Did somebody actually write this script? Did somebody sit down and say 'I've got a good idea'? Or perhaps Hollywood has begun sub-contracting work to mental institutions. <br/><br/>This is beautifully filmed, with pleasantly scored music, and contains two fine leading actors. I give it a star on each count. It is also 3 times as long as it should be and is so farcical and preposterous in concept; it ought to have been a comedy (which, in a way, it actually is). <br/><br/>Wallace and Gromit could have done the whole damn thing in half an hour for a fraction of the budget and still found time to catch a penguin in a milk-bottle.   <br/><br/>Death, where is thy sting?

I was looking forward to seeing the part where Joe reveals himself as an IRS guy and exposes Drew for being the jerk he was. As I remember, this was very cleverly done and I was SOOO disappointed that the SciFi Channel cut this part of the movie entirely.<br/><br/>For the record, I like this movie a lot, but hated the ending. It was too cheesy. (Though I certainly don't have an alternate ending that would suffice, either :-) I LOVED the scene with the Jamaican woman (by the way, I think SciFi cut out one of the scenes with her, as well, because I'm seeing in reading the prior posts here that it was mentioned she was in two scenes). Anyway, I thought when he met her in the hospital was extremely touching.<br/><br/>I love the relationship between father and both daughters. Yes, it made me cry."
"dc_comedyagency","8","2","3","19 November 2007"," Great movie, terrible ending
","The movie itself is very good. I didn't mind the fact that it was three hours long, I liked it. In the movie Susan falls in love with Joe (Death). She then learns that he is death, or at least that something is very wrong with him. Joe/Death then has to exit her life, however he sends back the man who's body he has taken. Susan then says ""what the hell"" and goes back to the party with this man. Moral of the story: she doesn't care who is inside of the body, as long as it looks like Brad Pitt she's happy. Totally ruins the three hour movie. My advice: turn off the film when Death walks over the hill at the end.<br/><br/>So over all, good movie, terrible ending."
"treeskier802","7","2","3","2 July 2007"," Pitt & Hopkins Make This Confusing Movie Enjoyable
","Meet Joe Black is confusing. If you are the kind of person who enjoys a movie where you have to try to determine what you believe the meaning of the story is, then you will like this film. If you would rather watch a movie that has a straightforward story, then avoid this completely.<br/><br/>I am personally not a huge fan of films like this. Generally, I see them as a gimmick to lovers of old literature who enjoy acting like a sleuth in figuring out what the story means. I used to enjoy doing that in my literature classes in college, but don't enjoy that with films.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt plays Death, who comes to visit Anthony Hopkins for a week or so before Hopkins is to die. Somewhere along the way, Hopkins is supposed to have a revelation about what life means, and I suppose the audience is supposed to as well. It is all rather confusing as to what we are supposed to learn. This film is definitely trying to convey a message, but you have to decipher what it is and quite frankly, it is not that awe inspiring of a message.<br/><br/>With this said, Pitt really is incredible in this film. It is one of his best all-time performances and he has great chemistry on screen with Hopkins. Hopkins, as usual, is also excellent. If it wasn't for the great acting and chemistry of these to performers, I would have stopped watching the movie. As it turned out, I enjoyed watching the film in its entirety just to see these two work. Rating 7 of 10 stars."
"fionapeters","7","2","3","9 April 2007"," a little long but worth it
","I really liked this film. I like the premise of having death not really understanding the good parts of being human. I think Brad Pitt did a great job with his role. I especially like the peanut butter part. Also, I think he did a great job changing from the man happy go lucky man he played in the first couple scenes to the darker character of death. I think all the performances were really good. I liked the little details like the cold lamb sandwiches. The movie was a tad long which is why I think most people don't like it, but I enjoyed it. The death and taxes storyline was great. I like how that came full circle. The party was amazing I wish I could have been there. I like the underlying theme of finding happiness and love and leading a full life. I'll admit I shed a few tears at the end. The only thing that bothered me was that Anthony Hopkins character was only 65 which seemed a little young. But, I guess leading a fast pace life in the corporate world tends to ware on a person. This film was very entertaining. If you ever have three hours give it a watch!"
"arthera09","8","2","3","11 March 2007"," surprisingly good
","I actually enjoyed this movie and would say that premise was the most interesting part. I am currently interested in how one can betray death in film and literature and I feel as if this had a very interesting take on the subject. Honestly my favorite parts of the movie were with Anthony Hopkins basically standing up to death letting him know that we was not scared. The love story was the center of the film, but I wished that they spent more time on Death's exploration of the world and all of it's mysteries. There was so much more that they could have done with that part of the film. The movie was a bit long, but I somehow got drawn in. The music was wonderfully scored and it was well casted. I honestly could have done without the ending and I would have almost preferred that the guy in the coffee shop would have stayed dead. I really liked the scene where Death was explaining how he was able to multitask and how it Anthony Hopkins was able to turn it on Death and show him humans work on a level he cannot understand. I will use a bit of these interactions in my story, but I did actually enjoy the movie."

","This film is an outstanding example of well casted, well acted cinema - It touches the familiar feelings deep inside of all of us and has such clarity to how we deal with personal issues both positive and tragic - How we all make an effort to understand the long and winding road before us in this life and in any additional manner of life following - <br/><br/>also important to note, Brad Pitt being an Understudy in many was to the great Robert Redford - of course Redford having Brad Pitt play the very unique role in ""A River Runs Through It "" what many of you probably overlook -is that Robert Redford played a similar short role in a classic Rod Serling brief early in his career around 1962 - about an injured policeman who comes to an old woman's cabin - and he (Redford) is Mr. Death - <br/><br/>So it is very ironic that Brad Pitt should have this great chance at a similar role in Meet Joe Black - being the handsome young man coming to Hopkins as Death, just as similar was Reford, even more handsome when he was younger, coming to the old woman's house as Death - <br/><br/>Meet Joe Black should have been recognized far more by the academy - it is a must to see - and can be viewed quite often while still enjoying it, this is a 10 on scale of 1 - 10 and will hold up as the years go on - most certainly - <br/><br/>See this film - you will really enjoy it - If you like quality films - You really have to love this artistic piece - <br/><br/>Heres to world peace: Ponch *"
"terryhall2","7","2","3","8 November 2006"," Glamorous but Slow moving
","Very slow moving film which dragged in places despite the nice music which actually drowned out the actors in some places (the birthday finale for example) Brad Pitt seemed to not emote very much, even when he wasn't representing 'death' and there were too many long scenes of people staring at each other...especially the lead actress. Like a Brazilian soap. Brad Pitt is such an attractive guy he should be able to act some depth under the veneer, which he couldn't really do here. The ending is very unlikely when Death takes Anthony Hopkins off over the bridge at the end of the birthday party (you'd still want to see what happened to your dad whether you understood what was going on or not.) Nice glamorous scenes but I just wanted it to get a move on. Nice touch: the death and taxes references"
"magnjim","8","2","3","9 October 2006"," It may surprise you.
","I have watched this film a number of times and on each occasion find I am delighted all over again. Although the basic storyline remains with me I find new nuances not noticed previously. Not only are the actors each wonderful in their roles, but the overall package is both entertaining and absorbing. I find ""Meet Joe Black"" to be a thought provoking and mesmerizing concept. Sure, Death takes a holiday has been done before but I particularly like this version where we see Death learn the ways of humankind, and come to value life itself. I particularly enjoy the music. It is both haunting and evocative.I recommend it to anyone - not just Brad Pitt fans. It may surprise you (but bring tissues). Just one point though, the final scene. Susan appears to understand that her father has died and that Joe has reverted back to the man in the coffee shop. Although moving this scene always poses unanswered questions for me. However, the film remains one of my favourites."

"mgsmoviesniper","Null","2","3","27 August 2006"," Every time I watch this film, I want to cry happy tears
","""Meet Joe Black"" is one of those films that will make you smile from start to finish. With talented stars, a script rich in plot and characters, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie to watch.<br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of an earlier film called ""Death Takes A Holiday."" In ""Meet Joe Black"" death takes human form as he comes to see the world, with the assistance of the body he is going to take. Anthony Hopkins adds his superstar status as the feisty father, which he plays so convincingly.<br/><br/>There is only one result that can come from inserting two of the most talented actors in a film that has great writing. Hopkins stars alongside Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani in one of the most romantic, intelligent and character driven movies I have seen in a long time. Excitement and pleasure were two feelings that made my heart skip a beat.<br/><br/>When I heard Hopkins would be a part of the film, I immediately thought the amount of credibility he would give toward ""Meet Joe Black."" Hopkins is the type of actor like Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman whose mere presence on film will alert the viewer that they will be watching a great film. Hopkins brought integrity, intelligence, and honesty to this role.<br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" is truly a movie filled with romance, excitement, joy, happiness, and sorrow. Brad Pitt's approach was enjoyable to watch as he seemed to pull it off with such great innocence. It was like he is learning everything from scratch, though he may know more than he is letting on. Also, Pitt's performance is like a mirror image to that of Hopkins.<br/><br/>Forlani is a vision to behold in ""Meet Joe Black"" as her beauty radiates off the screen with such heat. Forlani showcases her true ability to capture the essence of her character and portray it with innocence and sincerity. Audiences will enjoy the surprises Forlani has for them."

","Greatly enjoyed this version of the story and of course the great beauty of Claire Forlani,(Susan Parrish),""The Limit"",'03. Susan Parrish is the daughter of a very famous business man, Anthony Hopkins,(William Parrish), and is his favorite daughter, who he is very protective of and does not approve of her present boyfriend. Susan meets Brad Pitt,(Joe Black) in a coffee shop and all at once they both seem to be very much attracted to each other, almost like Love At First Sight. It is not long after this encounter with each other that they become face to face in Bill Parrish's large home and are having dinner together, however, Joe Black seems to be a different person.

","Is a great and sensational love story. The crew is very good and the performances are amazing. Once again Anthony Hopkins shows why he is a wonderful actor. Brad Pitt is recently appearing in Hollywood and makes an incredible performance. For me, the moment of the movie is the scene in the coffee shop, where he and Susan meet each other........the way he try to love her, the way he speaks to her is absolutely amazing. The other great scene is the end, when Bill dance his last dance with his daughter and after that he goes with Brad Pitt for dying.....the dialog they had a few moments before, makes anybody cry.....the music is very emotional. I think the only dab thing of this movie is that there are a lot of scene that goes very slow or takes to much time. I think the story could had taken less time, but is OK anyway"

"rwcbanzai","10","2","3","28 October 2005"," Death Takes a Holiday
","I know it's not a polite topic to discuss in public. However it's a topic that can't be overlooked and best discussed rather than spending so much in therapy. From the moment of life there's death. It awaits all things in life whether or not at the moment we believe it. So, how do we deal with it? Sometimes in self denial, sometimes in self abuse, sooner or later we all have to face it. This fallacy of positive thinking, always believing somehow we too can escape that grasp of death.<br/><br/>Now if you read this far, in that quest for knowledge. A seeking mind for the wisdom of truth. You will find in this journey it's all in our perspective, a matter of faith, belief in our own attitude. Ask any medical provider who strives to prevent it, ask any soldier who has to face it, clear down to the undertaker who must daily prepare it. Then talk to those that almost bought it! That Grim Reaper is there always when we least expect it. So, we tend to deal with it in movies, plays, poetry and song. An art form mirroring life as if it was just mere amusing entertainment. <br/><br/>We can put a spin on it in cd's like in the songs of Dido's ""No Angel"". Where we can feel the chords of melancholy of love long lost. We can find beauty in it in movies like ""American Beauty"", a journey of one man's mid life crisis and unfortunate life ending. Or, on the other hand, we can find that death can indeed take a holiday in a movie like ""Meet Joe Black"".<br/><br/>Most of these artistic expressions are epitomes of character assassination. However, in ""Meet Joe Black"" the twist is now, it becomes a matter of choice. Answering your own questions, dispelling your own doubts, overcoming fear and desire and our most basic emotions. Imagine a dialogue with Death, talking heart to heart with the Grim Reaper and at the same time teaching it all about life. This is a classic movie, excellent script of dialogue, love, compassion, innocence, honor and legacy with a splash of spin and clever twist. Centered around the simplest things in life, like peanut butter! The themes of inescapable reality, like death and taxes, feelings like hard to let go and cherishing those snapshots that in the end you take with you. It's great fodder to ponder, do we really converse with death in those final days and... would you?<br/><br/>So if you feel that you can cry every fifteen minutes in passion and compassion. If you feel you can watch a contemptuous dance with death for over three hours. If you feel it's a topic that merits just cause and deep contemplation to just bury the dead. Or if your just looking for good tear jerk emotions. Listen to ""No Angel"", take a deep look at ""American Beauty"". Turn up the volume of your DVD player to catch the whispers and ponder. Then ""Meet Joe Black""!"

"soimaru","10","2","3","22 January 2004"," Beware brainiacs!
","Yes, that means YOU! Here's a little tip to start you off on the right foot with this movie: before viewing it, make sure you're calm, relaxed and have a good couple of hours to enjoy and think about what it means to you. If you're not sure about it, please do yourself a favor and try to find a better time spot to watch this incredible picture, because otherwise you won't be able to appreciate it to its fullest extent, an obvious and truly regrettable mistake for most of the viewers.<br/><br/>If I could have my own way, concerning the review, I would happily write at least 5 page essay on this film, because anything else is just smoke up the ass, --as someone very close to Joe (B. Pitt) might elegantly put it ;-) --, but this is hardly the place to do it.<br/><br/>Now that we've gotten that out of the way, I'd like to say a few words with regard to the nature of ""Joe Black"": it is the kind of viewing experience that you have,..no--you MUST enjoy with your heart, your emotions, don't let your everyday logic take hold of you and tell you what is and what is NOT possible because you will never understand what the ""deal"" is and will definetly miss the whole point by a million miles.<br/><br/>It's basicly a story about an impossible love between a beautiful and charismatic woman and an entity, embodied as a young man, which exists completly above the human condition even though it is inherently tied to its destiny. The journey and reunion of these 2 worlds can only be made through love, TRUE and pure in every way possible. Because it begins from such a mythical standpoint, evoked by genious artists of the past in numerous ballads and poems, the story can allow itself to blur out the crossing line between what we see as REAL and possible and the realm of fantasy, myth and philosophy. The comedic moments are of no real shortage either, except they do not abund but are skilfully enhanced by the delightfuly extraordinary performances of Sir Anthony Hopkins (solid as ever), Brad Pitt (the man never ceases to amaze me) and an outstanding Claire Forlani.<br/><br/>
Stereotypical patterns of movie analysis that critics and movie-going, popcorn-tossing brainiacs have used for years and years simply do not apply here, because this one actually requires an open mind and a morally and intelectually educated person to fully comprehend. And no, damnit, I'm not that kind of person, I've just barely touched the tip of the iceberg here! Social statures, wealth and the location of the events in ""Joe Black"" are irrelevant, -- not inexistent -- and the reason for that is this is not a socio-political drama, but a huge metaphore of LOVE, please, PLEASE get that straight into your minds!<br/><br/>Even after watching it in perfect conditions, you haven't understood anything and feel as if you're looking down an empty, dark barrel with only your echo to keep you interested, then God damnit, it's NOT for you... and I don't give a rat's ass, because it was never supposed to be for everybody!<br/><br/>
PS: if you are one of those persons that likes to whine about the movie being too long and you're so lazy you didn't even take the time to check out how long the movie lasted BEFORE you bought the tickets/rented it, you should stay indoors and stick to your soaps, seriously!"

I'm not going to tell anything about the final scene of the movie because I don't want to spoil anything for the people that would decide to see it.

","This is a wonderful movie. It takes an extraordinary premise and deals with it in a realistic way. This is how it would be if Death were to visit Earth in human form.<br/><br/>But the main story isn't really what this film is about. It shows life and people at their worst and at their best. We have selfishness, greed, betrayal, loss and death. But we also have family, love, joy, hope and courage in the face of the ultimate foe. All these and more are portrayed with heartaching beauty.<br/><br/>Sadly, some people just won't get it. They will see the perfect pacing as slow, the story as fanciful. They will bemoan the lack of ""action"", regale the realisticly restrained character portrayals as poor acting. That's a shame - for them. They will miss one of the finest cinematic experiences without ever knowing it. But for the rest of us this film will remain forever a stunning portrayal of what it is to be human, to live, to love, to win and lose - and to die.<br/><br/>One of the very finest of life's vicarious experiences."
"thirdi","10","2","3","13 November 2002"," Somehow it works
","On the surface, a three hour dialogue-driven drama/love story might seem absurdly long.  But ""Meet Joe Black"", in that undefinable way that some movies do, manages to deliver a satisfying experience.<br/><br/>The story is actually quite simple:  Death himself comes calling for the latest mortal soul whose time on Earth is done, but instead decides to take a short vacation and familiarize himself with Earthly ways and human experiences.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins, the soul in question, is a wealthy media mogul who strikes a deal with Death (Brad Pitt) and plays host to his curiousities about life. While showing him around and introducing him to family and friends, Death falls in love with Hopkin's daughter (Claire Forlani).<br/><br/>The performances are solid all around.  Despite the criticism I've seen, Brad Pitt's subtle performance was intended and I thought right on the money.  I don't think Death would be quite normal walking around in something as unusual as life.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie is long, but surprisingly it never drags.  It's just one of those three hour films that feels like an hour and a half.  There are countless scenes of well-written dialogue and excellent acting that keep the modest plot moving.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised this movie generates mixed reviews, it seems like one of those ""love it or hate it"" things.  But somewhere in the middle of it all, there are some truths about life that shine through.  It's difficult to put your finger on all the impressions you will come away with after watching this movie, but it's certainly three hours well-spent."
"cannston","9","2","3","1 November 2002"," Far above the norm
","Most modern movies use tricks and conceits to grab and hold your attention. This movie, like its protagonist, fails to stoop to such manipulation, instead gently allowing you to bring out your best.  The message here is very simple - love, be courageous, accept your weaknesses and failures but don't let them hold you back.  The acting is so precise and compelling, that no tricks are necessary to carry you along into what should be an unbelievable premise.  Brad Pitt pulls off the daunting task of portraying a non-human discovering what being human is, from the first taste of peanut butter to the pain and rapture of love.  Anthony Hopkins is a mouthful of fine wine from a lead crystal glass - so odd to think this could be the same man who plays a cannibal elsewhere.  If you feel an unexamined life is not worth living, you'll enjoy this film."

","I confess I've seen this movie many times. I liked it since the first one. Beyond the story of the movie there is a deep meaning: Love is passion, obsession, something you cannot live without. And live without looking for it is like to not live. Sometime life gives us a chance, sometime in a coffee shop, sometime in a party. Don't wish it away and try to love."
"Al Sim","3","2","3","18 January 1999"," Pretentious direction, horrible script, questionable acting.
","Don't get me wrong, I like Martin Brest... I thoroughly enjoyed Scent of a Woman; likewise Beverly Hills Cop. However, Brest's need to drag out every single scene to at least twice the length it should be had me squirming in my seat, most notably the scene where Hopkins first meets Pitt. This movie was based around a similar movie (Death Takes a Holiday, 1934) which was 74 minutes in length and I can't help but think Joe Black could have been condensed to a similar length without taking out too many of the essential ingredients.<br/><br/>Onto the script. Apart from the glaring inconsistencies (without giving too much away, one minute Death is so incredibly naive, whereas the next he seems to know a great deal about things he shouldn't), a lot of conversation seems to be somewhat forced, with a lot of people repeating what someone else just said. There is also a lot of empty silence in the movie, which could have been filled in with music, or _something_. It's not like it's meant to be a tense thriller or anything.<br/><br/>Finally, the acting. Hopkins, as always, puts in a good performance, but it seemed like his heart just wasn't in it, and he appeared more subdued than usual. There was very little chemistry between Forlani and Pitt, and during those moments when they're alone, he seemed to be looking everywhere _but_ into her eyes (was the set background _that_ interesting? I mean... she has beautiful eyes, I wouldn't have a problem looking at them).<br/><br/>In conclusion, I would have to give it two big thumbs down."

"clydefrogg","9","2","3","7 April 2002"," Love it or hate it
","I think this film is magnificent and very unfairly criticized.  It is fantasy at its best, is beautifully filmed, well written and well acted. Anthony Hopkins, in particular, is fantastic.  And above all, when it comes to love, ""lightning should strike"" and we shouldn't settle. <br/><br/>
Some people (OK, most people) say this film is too long, and that is their biggest problem with it.  I think that's one of the films more prevalent attributes, so that's where I'll start.  Either you're into a film or you're not.  If you're not into it, even a 90 minute film can seem like an eternity if there's no ""action"".  Camille, A.I., Me Myself and Irene and any James Bond movie fit that bill for me.  Therefore, this is one of those films where I won't argue with someone who doesn't like it.  It's impossible to like a film that can't sustain your interest.  Usually, unless it's just an obviously bad movie, the blame for this lies with the viewer.  However, I can concede that this film is not for all tastes and let the naysayers off the hook.<br/><br/>I don't think the film is slow at all, I just think that Martin Brest took his time in allowing the story to unfold and the characters to develop.  Joe Black is very much a character study.  Most character studies only involve one person.  This one has two main characters and three or four more lesser characters who are all studied to one degree or another.  Cutting this film down to two hours would mean losing a lot of the insight we get into these characters.  No scene is rushed in this film.  All are allowed to develop at their own pace and continue on until they've said what they have to say. It's a marvel, and an tribute to the film that the studio allowed it to be released at this length.  The decision makers must have had similar thoughts, or they would have chopped an hour off it.  After all, the far inferior original, Death Takes A Holiday, was less than 90 minutes, I believe.<br/><br/>The cinematography for this film is absolutely beautiful.  It's not real hard to believe that the movie had such a large budget when you stop to notice how magnificent the settings are.<br/><br/>Thoughts on the cast...Anthony Hopkins lends dignity and credibility to every film he's in.  His character represents another moral of this film, I think, that we should do as much in this life as possible before it's gone. He, particularly, is the master of ""keep filming until I'm done talking"" in this film.  He's a careful man, and he chooses his words carefully.  He is not one to be rushed.  Neither is Death.  Brad Pitt certainly isn't the best thing about this film, but he doesn't hurt it any.  His take on the character is at least a fresh and interesting one.  And often funny.  Marcia Gay Harden is effective as the lesser loved daughter.  The first time I saw this film, I thought for sure Jeffrey Tambor would be a villain, as he always seems to be.  I was pleased to see him in a role as a weak, but essentially good man.  Claire Forlani is really what makes the wheels of this film turn, though.  After all, what is the premise of this film?  Death falls in love with a mortal woman.  How long has this guy been around?  How many women has he come across?  In other words, the girl better be pretty great.  One of the many weaknesses of Death Takes A Holiday is the girl that Death falls for, Evelyn Venable, is pretty weak.  I won't pretend Forlani is a modern day Katherine Hepburn, but she is incredibly beautiful and, in addition to portraying her character well, has a presence about her that Venable lacked.  She's believable as someone Death would fall for.  I guess. How the hell do I know?  <br/><br/>This film is a big throwback to the classic era.  I won't say it's Capraesque, since it digs a lot deeper into the characters than any of Frank's films, but the idealistic hero in an unrealistic situation is very reminiscent of Capra's films.<br/><br/>Here's a thought that I can't really fit into any other paragraph, so I'll give it it's own.  Although the propensity of films to include an obligatory sex scene seems to have dwindled off in the last decade from it's ridiculous plateau in the 70's, I still tend to get annoyed by them in today's films. Come on, it's the 21st century.  We know they're having sex, we don't need to see it for five minutes.  Every director seems to think he'll be the one to make his sex scene better than the others, or show us something we haven't seen hundreds of times already.  Almost always, they are wrong and the sex scene is tedious.  This film's scene is an exception.  First, it is different because we're talking about Death here.  But besides that, Brest films the scene just like he films the rest of the film.  Beautifully and slowly.  Most importantly, he concentrates the camera on facial expression, not naked bodies.  <br/><br/>The ending is sappy and pours it on.  But I love it.  Go ahead and call me soft.  I love the fireworks.  I love the endless rendition of ""What a Wonderful World"".  And I love the happy ending.<br/><br/>Typically, I think remakes and new takes of/on old films are inferior to the originals.  But this is the exception.  Meet Joe Black takes the far inferior Death Takes A Holiday much deeper.  Death Takes A Holiday portrays Death falling in love at first sight, and the whole film only lasts one night.  Fredric March is a great actor, but was extremely robotic in that role.  To do a story like this, the Death character needs to have a personality.  One of the many reasons this version is superior."

","***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS*** I bought the ultimate edition DVD of this movie a few days ago. I had seen it once before some years ago and i must say my recollection of the movie was entirely different from what it turned out to be. I'd say in the bottom line this is a somewhat strange yet ordinary love story, it is however much more deep and serious than most movies in it's genre.<br/><br/><<<<SPOILERS>>>><br/><br/>It's a story about Bill Parrish(Anthony Hopkins)a man who days before his 65:th birthday begin to hear a ""voice"" calling to him saying; YES. He is naturally confused and terrified about this and thinks he is losing his mind. Moments later he gets an unordinary visitor. In the movie he is described as DEATH(Brad Pitt). He has come to take Bill to the other side but in order to reach Bill he naturally needs a human body. He takes the body of a young man without knowing that Bill's daughter(Claire Forlani) just recently met this man in a local coffee shop and experienced what is referred to in the movie as LIGHTNING. Death also has another agenda, he wants to experience life. In my opinion he is fascinated about Bill's intelligence and the way he expresses himself, he talks about love, passion, obsession etc. I think death finds these things very interesting and wants to learn more of life on ""earth"". So he decides to stay for a while and forces Bill to let him live in his house. Well you don't need to be Einstein to figure out what happens when Bill's daughter comes home for dinner and sees Joe Black, that's the name Bill gives him. Yes they eventually fall in love. I do not wish spoil anything else for someone out there who still haven´t seen this movie and intend to do so.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is almost 3 hours long it never gets too long. It is filled with magnificent dialogue throughout the entire movie. This is a very intelligently made movie that really gets you thinking mostly about love and death. The characters are very likable and natural. The leading performances are as we've seen several times before from Pitt and Hopkins simply perfect. Claire is also superb, she isn't just beautiful, she can also act i honestly can't think of anyone more suitable for her role. Even though this is a romantic drama/comedy of some kind it is unlike any other i've seen in that category. Those kind of movies tend to be very sappy and predictable, everything this movie isn't. It is however very tragic and sad but in a good way. Especially the ending in this movie is surprisingly good. I sincerely recommend this movie to everyone regardless of taste. I will most certainly be looking forward for more exciting movies from the amazing director Martin Brest.<br/><br/>Bill: Should i be afraid?<br/><br/>Death/Joe: No, not a man like you."

","I really liked this picture, which is interesting, because I tend to agree with a number of the negative comments I've read on this board. Many have complained that the movie is redundant and too long (three hours!).<br/><br/>Whether, the movie is too long is, of course, a matter of perspective. I enjoy three-hour baseball games. Why not a three-hour movie? The question is whether one feels that the three hours were well spent--and that depends on what one expects out of those three hours.<br/><br/>If one is looking for a tight movie where characters set their course based on one conversation or one event, then skip this one. If you are open to characters that are somewhat more complex and need to hear the same thing in more than one way to get the message, then you just might enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Also, if you're looking for a love story balanced by an action film (Titanic, Pearl Harbor), then, again, you will be disappointed. I think studio marketing departments have figured out that guys like action films and women like love stories, so they try to blend the two in order to maximize box office. This film pretty much ignored that.<br/><br/>This film deals with a number of relationships among a number of people and their relationship with ""death"". I won't list them all, but at the conclusion of the film, I felt as if I knew these people. I liked many of them, and I felt they had depth to them. From the dialog I constructed their pasts in a way I tend not to with movie characters. These people stayed with me. If you give them a chance, they might stay with you as well."

","I was reluctant to see this movie when it opened in my country since it got lousy reviews and because everyone I knew who'd seen it said it was boring. Some days ago I saw Anthony Hopkins in an interview where he said this was one of his favorite movies and I confess this awakened my curiosity.<br/><br/>It was on cable tonight and thought I'd found out why he´d said that, being an actor I admire and found always excelling in whatever part he is to play.<br/><br/>I did find the movie a bit too long and slow moving, but I also found that was not disgusting at all. I like situations and characters to develop and ¿why should that always be quickly done? I also found some of the moments when Joe Black is introduced to the family a little awkward. I believe director Brest does not always blend the comedy bits well with the romantic or dramatic streams of the story, maybe it's due to the pace, maybe it's due to some solemnity  imposed to Brad Pitt's performance.<br/><br/>Anyhow, however corny the fireworks at the end it might have seemed to some viewers, the movie builds up to an overwhelming finale where life and death are marvelously brought together.<br/><br/>Hopkins and Forlani are wonderful all through the movie and so is the rest of the cast. Brad Pitt looks somehow restrained at moments but ends up by convincing you(at least I was).<br/><br/>Underrated as it is I think it deserves a high rank, much above other pretendedly masterpieces of our days."

Imagine a nether-worldly presence that looks at the world through detached eyes, not knowing what or why humans feel. Death breathes down everyone's neck and people concern themselves with trivial worldly matters.<br/><br/>
This film has a wonderful spiritual theme. Enjoy your life. Wake up knowing that you need nothing more - that when it's time to leave for the next world, that's ALL that needs to be done. No regrets. There are not many films that give people a sense of calm about leaving this life. I think ""The Sixth Sense"" is the last one that did that for me. <br/><br/>See this one with someone you love.

But the acting in Meet Joe Black surpasses every one of them, for as far as I'm concerned.<br/><br/>The story might be a little unbelievable, but that's ok. The storyline isn't really what counts here. It's the excellent dialogues between Pitt, Hopkins and Claire Forlani (what a discovery !!) that make this movie worthwhile.<br/><br/>The whole film is set on a very emotional edge. You feel you could cry any moment. Pitt is so magnificent as the shy and inverted Joe Black. Forlani is a sight for sore eyes, and Hopkins, what can I say ... nothing but good things. Great things.<br/><br/>I've heard that many people found Meet Joe Black a bad movie, that it was too boring, or too long. Well in my opinion that's so untrue. The 3 hours are very worthwhile, you must not be put down by the long dialogues, or by the romantic, dramatic undertone.<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black is also one of the few movies that I actually cried at the end. Really cried. The ending is so beautifull, so amazing.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie very highly.

","This is the most touching film I have even seen.  The topic of life, death and love is quite serious yet this film has quite a few humorous scene (anyone laugh at the IRS agent scene?)  The end is kind of sad but the tone of the whole movie is uplifting. The first time I finished this movie, I had no idea that 3 hours had passed. In my opinion, the length is needed to develop the complex plot and the character. I am especially impressed with Brad Pitt's performance. When he first appeared as death, he was quite stiff in his movement, expression, and conversation. In the end during William Parrish's confrontation with Drew, he was quite sophisticated and humorous.<br/><br/>This movie is simply beautiful to watch. The cinematography is wonderful. The lighting, music, words, expression and body movement of the characters all fit together in harmony.<br/><br/>I lost my husband a year and half ago to cancer. I find this movie rings so many truth in my heart. The message about love, being deliriously happy, waking up in the morning and say ""there is nothing I want more"", saying goodbye and taking nice pictures with you.  All these things I keep thinking about after I watched the movie, the happiness that I used to feel all come back in a flood...<br/><br/>I loved this movie so much that I searched for reviews and comments on line. I was horrified at all the bad reviews from critics. I wonder how many people didn't watch this movie because of the bad reviews. I am sorry for the people who disliked the movies simply because of its length. I suppose if some people think a good lunch is hamburger and fries washed down with soda in half an hour, they might not enjoy a leisure sit-down lunch in a french restraunt with a glass of wine. I recommend this movie to a friend who didn't watch it in the theatre because of the bad reviews she read, she and her husband really liked it. If you like this movie, I hope you recommend it to your friends too.  If I had missed this movie, I would have felt it's a big loss."

"mccracd","Null","8","21","11 April 2003"," What a Curious and Romantically Compelling Mess
","Against my better judgment, I find myself truly liking this film. Sure it's too long, yet the lingering pace allows most of the characters to display a depth that gives a certain reality, so unusual in an era of thoughtless action and explosions.<br/><br/>The film is still tremendously flawed - any movie with such a string of credited screenwriters is sure to be a messy mongrel affair (and the horribly hacked-up tv version mangles things even further and leaves poor Jeffrey Tambor's character as a mere shadow).  Marcia Gay Harden, wonderfully insecure, starts the movie with the promising theme of the neglected sister, but is in turn neglected by the screenwriters and withers away.  Joe Black never even notices her. Bill Parrish/Anthony Hopkins, the patriarchal father, clearly regrets neglecting family matters, yet never gets an ultimate scene with them all together to express this. Susan/Claire Forlani is supposedly a medical resident, yet her character is given none of the aggressive and analytical traits needed in a doctor, and evidently only works around late breakfasts, long lunches, family dinners and afternoon dalliances anyway.  Hopkins has a 65th birthday for his thousand closest friends, yet not one of his board of directors is in attendance, but instead are at an impossibly late-night meeting elsewhere, all personified in that sub-plot's supposed dramatic climax by a tiny desk speakerphone.  The evil rival corporate raider never once appears on screen.  And yet I loved the slow introspection, the quiet afternoons, and the loving relationship between doting father and devoted daughter, and am captivated by this odd movie.<br/><br/>But I found the biggest flaw, by far, to have been with Joe Black himself, ironically, since this was presumably a star vehicle for Brad Pitt. Sadly, he's not the actor for this role.  True, Death could pick any body he chose, so why not Brad Pitt's, but I think the movie would have ""fit"" far better with an older man in the role who could have personified timeless wondering and yearning so much more understandably to a film audience. We expect more maturity somehow, more world-weariness in having ushered countless generations away from life.  More appropriate that Death should already know little things like cookies and peanut butter and not waste time on that.  It's the deep emotions of humanity that he was curious to feel, and that should have been the focus of his visit - frustrations of corporate life, sufferings of the dying, falling in love.  But we are given a young pup who wanders empty halls aimlessly with a totally impassive visage where the very heart of this film should have been, and I think that is why it failed.<br/><br/>Had, ironically, perhaps a Robert Redford or even Al Pacino of maybe 45 years old been given this role, I think it could have worked.  I can see those older faces taking in the new experiences of emotion, and dealing far more authoritatively, and eventually compassionately, with their hosts. Surely Susan/Claire Forlani would so much more naturally fall in love with an assuring father figure: clearly that's what she's seeking (I fell in love with Claire Forlani, by the way - stunningly beautiful, and I think did a fine job of portraying vulnerability and growing sagacity).  Bill Parrish would have bonded far better with a more mature-looking Death as well. The movie, then, didn't need an hour less; it needed a more compelling Joe Black.<br/><br/>A final word on the film score...  Thomas Newman has done wonderful work in such varied requirements as minimalist contemporary accompaniment for The Player and soulful introspection of Shawshank Redemption.  This film is three hours long, much of it in justified silence.  Perhaps because the screenplay was obviously hacked and shuffled about, some musical passages of an already fairly brief (relatively) score are simply repeated in different scenes.  Nonetheless, Newman's wonderfully atmospheric and lusciously romantic score should be pointed out for its merit.  I thought it was music of the highest order, tremendously enhancing the movie over-all.  The romantic theme/melody is gorgeous, and I loved the passage at the close of the love scene: the delicate rocking almost barcarolle/lullaby.  Someone else evidently liked it as well, as it's reprised at the very end of the credits (or else they needed an extra 30 seconds of something).  Were I ever in charge of a romantic movie, I would steal this exact score for it."

A half hour later a second attack came, I did the same thing, it subsided, and I fell asleep - happily to awaken.
I almost forgot to tell me doctor about these, and when I did he became alarmed, tests verified the attacks, and - at no expense in Norway's wonderful national health care - I had an angiogram: a little pipe inserted in the artery.

","In this film, Death takes the body of a person to be able to approach William Parrish, a media mogul to whom she asks for information about human life. Speaking in these terms, it looks like an old tale brought to this day. However, although the idea is good and the film has truly beautiful moments, its far from perfect. The film is quite elegant and has a beautiful cinematography, full of warm colors and little contrast, as if everything developed in a late afternoon or next to a fireplace. The actors are veterans that we like to see working, the environments, sets and costumes are exquisite... its good, the film has quality! Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins make a good pair when they split the screen, being able to get the best of each other, as well as being both icons of male charm, each on its own way. Claire Forlani also made a good, very restrained but strong performance, although the romance with Pitt's character is as cold and impersonal as his character. I said the movie was not perfect, remember? Beginning with the actors, Pitt made several mistakes and did certain things he shouldn't. His character is always lacking in human warmth and, if Death really wanted to learn more about humanity, this was something that should have gradually emerged in this character, especially when he falls in love. Love is the most intense and transformative human feeling and this is never suggested to us... I don't know if Pitt accepts without criticism everything directors and writers say he has to do, but it's his duty not to let his character fall, so he should have had the perception of the mistake that would be to keep such coldness from a certain point. But there are more problems: the script has an excellent main plot but is too dense and there are too many subplots, and that only helps to get the film out of focus. The director, Martin Brest, did a good job filming but clearly didn't give great relevance to pre and post production. He should have scrutinized the script better, eliminating some things, as well as requiring the editing team to cut out what was left over. And there's plenty of leftovers in a super slow movie, which drags on for three hours without any need, with overly long or ancillary scenes. It's a beautiful movie, but it's tedious to watch because we just lost the patience needed to watch something so long and so empty."

","Had I seen this back in the day it came out, it probably would have been one of my top favorite movies. But because I am watching it for the first time in 2016, I have to warn you it is slower than everything made today. But it is brilliant! <br/><br/>Its a super chick-flick, about death, who assumes a hot guys body to experience life from someone he feels has been successful at it. What he didn't expect was to fall in love with that mans daughter. <br/><br/>The love scenes are so beautifully made. Some of which you wish you could take a screen shot of and add it to your wall of art in your million dollar mansion in Paris. Fabulous.<br/><br/>It is a bit predictable with a bit of cheese. Did you like Field of Dreams? If you did, its that kind of cheesy, with a bit of whimsy that leaves you wishing you could live in that time, in that life, and experience the passion. The sweet love between father and daughter, and the incredible passion between the daughter and Joe. <br/><br/>Love it!!!"

","Death, who takes the form of a young man (Brad Pitt), asks a media mogul (Anthony Hopkins) to act as a guide to teach him about life on Earth and in the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter (Claire Forlani).<br/><br/>So this is a remake of a movie that was adapted from a play. Typically that could be concerning, as a remake is not often as good as the original. In this case, though, it may even be better... the cast is solid (with Forlani in one of her rare decent roles), and Brad Pitt making a name for himself (as if he has not already).<br/><br/>Really, this is a great display of Pitt's acting. He has solid range here, possibly more than anything else he has done. The character is very complex, and there is the odd twist that Forlani is attracted to him because he looks like someone he is not, and not for any deeper reason. Amazingly, even at three hours, this film never drags."

","This film is not for everyone yet it is one I believe should be given a chance by anyone who is living. It deals with heavy life issues, the ones that are inevitable for all of us. Yes, it does contain a romantic element but the story is not overtaken by this at all. If one decides to give this movie a try and watch it through, many revelations are to be gained. Obviously interpretation is different from person to person so there will be some who dislike the themes presented while some will love it. It is important to note that this film is not easy to watch for a few reasons. One reason is that it deals with themes that are sad and out of our control.

","The cycle of life on Earth hangs in the balance when Death becomes emotionally involved in this romantic fantasy film entitled,Meet Joe Black.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani together with Jake Weber,Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor.The film was loosely based on the 1934 film Death Takes a Holiday.This was the second pairing of Hopkins and Pitt after their 1994 film Legends Of The Fall.This was directed by Martin Brest.<br/><br/>William Parrish is a tremendously wealthy and powerful man who oversees a worldwide multi-media empire. Despite the loss of his wife, whom he dearly loved, William is content with his life, and he's very close to his two daughters, Allison and Susan. One night, as William is fighting a hostile takeover of his company and Allison is planning an elaborate party to celebrate her dad's 65th birthday, William begins displaying the symptoms of a severe heart attack, and he is visited by a mysterious stranger, Joe Black. Joe is actually the angel of death, who has taken the form of a man who recently passed on to pay William a call. It seems that William is due to move on to the next world, but he doesn't want to go. Joe, on the other hand, is curious to know what life is like for mere mortals, so the two men strike a deal -- William will have some time to get his affairs in order, and Joe will wait and see what it's like to be a human being. Joe decides that he likes it very much when he falls in love with Susan, but negotiating the slippery slopes of romance is no easier for Joe than for any ordinary man. <br/><br/>This is film is long.The story was uneventful.Also,it does not generate great interest to the viewer. But nevertheless,the cast did everything they could to make this an above average film. Despite of what has been said previously,it still would generate enough entertainment and satisfaction."

All the actors were marvelous with the lone exception of Claire Forlani who was OK but I got rather tired of the ""shy - I want to look at you but I'm afraid to"" thing in every scene with Brad Pitt. The music was excellent but too loud in many scenes and drowned out some of the dialogue. Especially loved the scenes with Pitt and the dying old Jamaican island lady. I didn't understand every word but the accents were marvelous. Pitt is more than just a pretty face. Hopkins turns in his usual excellent performance. I don't know how he does it. Jake Webber is a terrific villain as the oily, stab in the back character. Marcia Gay Harden is totally believable in her role. She doesn't overdo it. Just right. Jeffrey Tambor is equally believable as a slightly ""in over his head"" son-in-law who gets pushed around but finally stands up and does the right thing, regardless."

It's a strange thing for both our characters, as Hopkins, now, must say goodbye to his loves, and Pitt starts exploring the enriching human truths that define ideal relationships, particularly that which becomes of his newfound attraction to Hopkins's daughter.

It seems to me that Mr. Parrish was an example at that, and that's what Death came to find out - what was the secret behind that. Of course - the answer is simple - LOVE.

I personally enjoy the whole 'life's meaning' theme and the actual thought of having death take a vacation from it's dreaded routine to finding romance in an unexpected twist of fate. Both Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins's performance are brilliant, as they both go hand in hand in a secret of their own to their up-coming journey to that Next Place. When I watch this movie I seem to be confronted with a bundle of questions that unravel themselves as the movie continues-where do we go after we pass away?  what is the meaning of life? why are we here?  And I personally enjoy the dialogue between Joe and the Jamaican lady in the hospital as she explains child-like Joe that life is not all fun and games, and that he should take those colorful pictures that he was able to take through out his journey, before he takes unpleasant ones.

","((Contains spoilers))<br/><br/>My lasting memory of the first time that I watched Meet Joe Black is the feeling that I didn't want it to end.  I don't normally cry at films but this one had me welling up.  That was down to several factors, which make this one of the most beautiful films ever, made. First, the acting was superb on all accounts.  With the possible exception of Jake Weber's (Drew) mediocrity, which only shows through in comparison to the other leading cast members, everyone played their parts perfectly and believably. Pitt (Joe Black) does well as the naive Death, bemused by the world and it's foibles and overcomes the initial reaction one has when seeing a pretty, blonde boy playing such a fearful character. Forlani (Susan Parish), though not given many lines to get her teeth into, radiates vulnerability, but strangely subservience also.  Refreshingly, the beauty of her deliverance is more in her expressions than in her lines; perfect subtleties display her character's thoughts and feelings without having to resort to obvious gestures or words. Finally, Hopkins shows, yet again, his mastery portraying the kind, down-to-earth man that is Bill Parish.  Cumbersome lines are delivered with breath-taking accuracy and speed, full of emotion and realism. That is not to say that the film is perfect:  Death has many cliqued moments that seem to be ripped straight out of Terry Prachett's discworld series; Bill Parish is all too nice, seeming to have no bad qualities; and the ending sequence leaves those who fell in love with Brad Pitt as Death a little disappointed when Forlani is handed back the original ""Joe"". There is no mistaking that this is very much a dialogue driven film and if you like a bit of action in your viewing then this is not the movie for you. And at three hours, those who are easily bored will be fidgeting in their seats after about an hour.  However, if you can appreciate a well scripted, well acted, well put together romance then you will find a tearful and human story that will prove that the critics DO get it wrong."

The character of Joe Black is so unique in the sense that he has feelings and that all he wants to do is feel what it is like to be ALIVE. Anthony Hopkins gives his usual outstanding performance as a media tycoon who believes that his company is there for the people and not solely for profit.  He shows that his family, and friends are the most important things in his life, not his company. Brad Pitt delivers a most outstanding performance as the simple and curious Joe Black, or Death.  He, mind you isn't the ""Death"" we all think of, he is more like the Angel of Death.  He only wants to see the world for all it's worth. This film is an absolute masterpiece, a true cornerstone of raw talent, and great drama.

","This movie has an awful lot going for it.  It's theme can be summed up by one of the old Jamaican womans lines, We lonely here mostly too.  If we lucky, we got some nice pictures to take with us.' Well this is a nice picture.<br/><br/>Claire Forlani is just achingly vulnerable as she (understandably) struggles to comprehend what is happening to her life.  The scenes where she and Brad are talking, or almost gently dancing, inches apart as they oh so politely marvel at each other are foreplay at its finest, to be frank.  The movie revels in the slow burn.  What happens is often much less important than the way it does.  Some of the plotting and characters can seem a little simplistic or one dimensional but after paying attention there is usually a little more going on that might appear.  (Allison:  I should have my head examined again.').  There are also some really funny and bizarre moments in huge contrast to the popular slow and ponderous' impressions of it.  Early on Allison sees fir to introduce herself to her own sister?  And later their father (Anthony Hopkins) is reminiscing about when they were both little girls and out of nowhere Quince chips in with I love little girls.'. Or Brad to Anthony, Calm down Bill.  You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation .'  And later on Bill, who has been very clearly set up as having almost everything a man could want, is reciting a list of all the things that in fact suck about his life and it finishes with, And oh yes! I almost forgot.  My daughters fallen in love with death.'  It's hard to accuse this of getting too serious really.<br/><br/>Everything is nothing without love' is a huge theme of the movie, and there are some great lines and moments as they make their point.<br/><br/>Be sorry for nothing.<br/><br/>Thank you for loving me.  (ahhh!)<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>Bill: It's hard to let go, isn't it? Joe Black: Yes it is, Bill. Bill: What can I tell you. That's life.<br/><br/>Watch this and let yourself go with it.

Granted, there are portions of the story line's progression that must be taken with a grain of salt (and a little blind faith), but the overall idea of the film is appealing.<br/><br/>I felt that Martin Brest did an admirable job of focusing the talents of Brad Pitt (Joe Black), Anthony Hopkins (William Parrish), Claire Forlani (Susan Parrish), Jake Weber (Drew), Marcia Gay Harden (Allison), and Jeffrey Tambor (Quince) into memorable characters.<br/><br/>There is something philosophical (or psychological) about the film, and without the preamble of excessive dialogue, the audience is drawn into each character's moral dilemma.  The overlying theme and question of the movie is, ""Whose approval do I need to live a happy life?""  One hopes that the only approval you need is your own, but realistically, as portrayed in the film, that is rarely the case.<br/><br/>I especially liked the chemistry between Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt.  It is believable and interesting.

","Meet Joe black is not a stunningly good film, the concept is a good one, and much more could have been made of it, and yet I find that I am glad that there wasn't. The film details the last days of William Parish's (a rich businessman) life; played with great finesse by Sir Antony Hopkins, culminating on his birthday. However, death (Brad Pitt) decides that with this customer he wants to take a look at what life is like, and so spends a few days with the Parrish family. The film is done in a very dreamy style throughout, with a masterful soundtrack by James Horner which massively adds to the films dream-like feel. This is not the sort of film which you should go into expecting an exciting piece of cinema. It is the sort of film you should watch on a rainy night in the winter when you can just curl up with a bottle of wine and enjoy it, as I did.<br/><br/>7/10"
"lights-5","Null","1","1","4 May 2002"," Beautiful film in spite of itself
","I have seen both the original 1934 film of Death Takes a Holiday, the 1971 TV-movie version, as well as the play on stage numerous times. I agree that in many ways, this film is superior, though mostly because of the very dated acting styles in the original.  Also, Claire Forlani turns in a luminous performance, as does Anthony Hopkins (as always).<br/><br/>There are two elements from the original play which I miss in this remake. One is that the premise of the story is that Death appears in human form in order to find out why humans cling so desperately to life.  The other is that nothing on earth dies while he is on 'holiday.'  I realize these concepts don't fit well with the 'Hollywood-ized' happy ending, but I do feel they're at the core of the story. In all the stage versions and both earlier filmed versions, I found the premise of the girl (originally Grazia, then Peggy) being one who constantly defies--and seeks--death, who then goes with him, a very romantic ending.  It always felt as if she became immortal. <br/><br/>Oddly, in all film versions, the role of Death has been miscast.  Brad Pitt is quite wooden, March silent-movie stiff, Markham a little too ingratiating.  Onstage, this role is usually cast with a true romantic leading man: handsome, suave, sensual. This does help make the whole story work. The original play's premise is that death arrives to take Grazia as she crashes her car, then he finds he can't because of her beauty and vitality.  I find this a much more solid and believable foundation for the story than the convoluted meeting between a guy and Susan in a coffee shop, and then at a dinner table.  Originally, SHE is the reason for it all--why he takes human form, why he takes a holiday, why he seeks the answer to his question.<br/><br/>By opening up the film as Hollywood will do, all the stuff about Hopkins's business is extraneous and the idea of Joe attending at board meetings (and the IRS resolution) rather preposterous.  The original confined the story to a remote country house, the 1971 one confines the now Kennedy-like family to a private island.  Meet Joe Black did the opposite and brought in the whole world and is the worse for it.<br/><br/>Yet MJB does work, in spite of itself.  Perhaps because the idea of seeing death in person and trying to figure out how he thinks is quite compelling. Despite his stature, Hopkins is not the center of the film, nor should he be.  Forlani is, and it is she who makes her scenes with Pitt work.  I was prepared to hate this film because I've loved the original story since I first saw it in about 1954, yet I find the film compelling and enchanting."

The running time allows the film to move at a steady pace, not rushing itself for the sake of those with short concentration spans. Infact the running length is indicative of the entire film for me.<br/><br/>It seeks not to conform but to draw you in. It gives you space and time to watch the characters develop, to show depths and aspects (especially with Pitt) that help you appreciate what is happening. Hopkins is on form here - he leaps on Parrish with passion and takes the dialogue to a level far beyond it's worth on paper. Pitt is also convincing and Forlani is superb.<br/><br/>Much work has gone into this film and I believe it shows. It moves me to tears each time I watch it. It's not perfect - the pay-off towards the end as Pitt reveals himself is disappointing and could have been better executed - but this is secondary to what the film is really dealing with. The core issues of a man coming to terms with a life about to end, the wonder of whether Forlani really did grasp what was happening and more captivated me.<br/><br/>Please do ignore those who whine about having to sit more then two hours to watch a film.

What makes this all the more amazing is that I'm more into the action genre of films (e.g. Con Air et al) than this more ""sentimental"" type of film.<br/><br/>However I was spurred on to write this mini review by the fact that I've literally just finished watching the film again on terrestrial TV - which reminded me just how good this film is ...<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing, and some scenes whose themes where more complex than usual were handled with pinache.  The music was good, although in my opinion it didn't lend itself to being released as a sound track to the film, it suited the film perfectly.<br/><br/>I don't think this movie won any awards or Oscars, which in my opinion is a crying shame - I personally rate this film above and way beyond films such as Titanic (starring Kate Winslet).  Anthony Hopkins and Claire Forlani were excellently cast in the two main leads - I sincerely hope to see more films of this type soon, and would recommend that everyone watch it at least once ! :-)"

I also predicted the ending, but there is a reason if you look closely enough. Just like the rest of the film. Nobody could accuse it of being shallow!<br/><br/>Also, on a side note, the social ineptitude of ""Joe Black"" reminded me more than a little of Terry Pratchett's comical DEATH in the book ""Reaper Man"" in which he decides to take a holiday in the world of the living...<br/><br/>10/10"

","This movie is so well done. Some may say it drags things out, but I think that made it more natural. In one scene my family was almost asleep because the Bill Parish character kept saying ""um.,.and...uh "" in a speech he was giving. That is how PEOPLE talk. Movies now a days are so concerned with delivering information quickly that it doesn't even seem like the people are thinking this stuff up off the tops of their heads. No, they seem like people with their lives scripted for them. Wouldn't that be great?<br/><br/>Brad Pitt deserves a lot of credit for this role. He had to convince the audience that the man Susan met in the coffee shop and Joe Black were two very different people. He also handled the other two hard tasks of this role very well: mix innocence and knowledge, and to have an edge to him that portrayed the cruelty we all see Death as. He handled it excellently.

","The Best: Among all the movie is hard to pin point a better part, as the movies better part is its whole! The Worst: The runtime of the movie may have been boring to some people, not to me, anyway. Rating: 8 /10<br/><br/>One nice morning multi-millionaire Bill Parrish wakes up in his New York's surroundings manor aware of the voices he said he heard during the last night. Bill Parrish holds in his hands the possible future of his company Parrish Communications with his follower Drew possible fiancÃ© to his daughter Susan. Susan, fresh woman at an hospital, routinely heads to the coffee shop where she usually has her breakfast, and there she meets the man who can possibly change her life forever, as for Bill, his head his in a weird place right now, not only he's nervous about the deal as for the upcoming 65 anniversary party. The voice Bill heard that night constantly hits him and speaks with him coldly and scarily, until one night at dinner the voice says it is on the door of his house waiting for some one to get him in. when he orders the maid to let the person in and join him to dinner, Susan gets in instantly gets in and gets in shock realizing the mystery man is the young man at the coffee shop.<br/><br/>This is the square one to a movie with several twists emotions and commotion. There's one thing that really may step the movie's promotion behind, and that's the point that common sense may think that the movie has some supernatural nature. It doesn't, the movie has its fantasy, but this isn't one of those movies that in the final 10 minutes has a completely CGI monster threatening to kill all mankind.<br/><br/>Plunge in to this movie where everything in it is over the top, but the dark line is that, in my opinion the movie isn't one of those that can be chosen as the all time favorite of anyone. The script is inventive and deep, and the choose for directing was a nice touch Martin Brest was a director that in common opinion wouldn't have been a possible choice but as it was I stand correctly has his work is after all appraisable. On close inspection, for instance you can see there is no actual goof of any kind. Brad Pitt is actually revealing himself as a versatile actor, but still many people associate his name to teenager fan hysteria. Anthony Hopkins once more gives a show of acting, his calm and bland acting is always a joy to watch, (maybe) newcomer Claire Forlani is not only a beauty face but a beauty talent. Emmanuel Lubezki, cinematography did an awesome job and most incredibly (it wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award!), and composer Thomas Newman, well I have loss for words for his incredible job, (my sister cries every time she sees the movie in its final half hour).<br/><br/>Too bad that Hollywood doesn't present us with movies like this every year! 8 out of 10."

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Judging from the reviews I guess that if this movie doesn't catch your interrest right off it never will, and then, yes, 3 hours is a VERY long time. However, it all went by fast, and I didn't take my eyes off the screen. (Many movies have me watching TV while they're running.) Admitted, yes, Pitt was a little too much sometimes, where he just seemed silly, but his preformance was captivating most of the time. It was genuinely intertaining to see this kind of manifestation of death. Majestic, powerful, utterly inconsiterate, but at the same time rather pathetic with no idea how to behave. Think 'Rainman meets the Terminator'. 9/10 if it catches your interrest. If it doesn't; you're in for 3 hours of solid boredom. But take a chance and rent it in any event.. And bring peanut-butter."

It's nice to have time to get to know a character, and this movie was mostly about two: Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) and his daughter Susan (Claire Forlani).  By the time it was all over, I admired an obscenely wealthy man, and was in love with Susan.  Brad Pitt did a wonderful job of playing a one-dimensional character (which I thought was the point), and Jeffrey Tambor and Marcia Gay Harden were terrific in support.<br/><br/>The Thomas Newman soundtrack is superb;  the movie looks great;  and even the closing titles are moving (accompanied by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole's amazing rendition of ""Over The Rainbow/What A Wonderful World"").<br/><br/>But my main reason for writing is that last night ABC showed something like the infamous ""Airline Version""--the entire backstory concerning the plotting behind Parrish's back to overthrow his publishing empire was expunged, and most of Tambor's best scenes along with it.<br/><br/>That the networks regard themselves as entitled to butcher movies I find quite as startling as that some think themselves entitled to negatively review a movie they haven't, by their own admission, actually watched..."

The moment when Claire Forlani realizes just who Joe Black really is is moving and memorable. Brad Pitt beautifully conveys the difference between the two characters who inhabit his body; and Anthony Hopkins delivers a tour de force from beginning to end. I know it's a hard thing to do in these frenetic times, but try letting go of reality and day-to-day mundanity when you watch this and other movies. Go with the characters; let the director take you on a journey. When the whole story is a fantasy, don't nit-pick about ""inconsistencies.""

Meet Joe Black is about a man named William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) who is nearing his 50th birthday and soon discovers he doesn't have long to live. Enter Joe Black or ""Death""(Brad Pitt) who decides to visit William Parrish to offer him a deal where by William gets to live as long as Joe Black is kept entertained and William doesn't tell any one whom Joe Black really is. From this Joe experiences human life and eventually falls in love with Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) William Parrish's daughter, with his new experiences with life and finding love Joe finds it hard to go back to his job. This movie is great for the romantic at heart and it also has a few tissue moments as well and not to mention a spectacular music score by Thomas Newman that burst out full of emotion.

By acting opposite an institution like Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt proves that he is more than just a teen idol, he is a great actor. Claire Forlani is astonishing, and Jeffrey Tambor is very funny.

"foxbaker","Null","1","1","11 April 2000"," The reason films were made
","Meet Joe Black is everything that films are about. Because it it is a message, a story and an experience that leaves you with ideas, hopes and dreams.  You could call it a love story, but the film has so many truths and encounters that count for so much in life that I would call it an experience. The setting of the rich lifestyle gives an arena where money & material things are not an issue, but the fact Hopkins' character has to lose his life's work shows that no matter how material people are, we should respect others lives and what they are worth.  The fact that Hopkins' will soon be dead put an immediacy on things and then we have to see a character who is bright and intelligent think about the things that are most important to him. This film handles everything so beautifully, the way the characters are also well placed but are then put with the rogue factor of Joe Black, I wasn't sure who was to be more unwelcome in their environment, death or the people that came into contact with him.  For someone like myself who hopes to make their own films in the future, I wish I could make something as clever, thoughtful but above all, emotional as this.  The score is fantastic as I'm sure everyone else will tell you.  I love punk rock and soul music but the classical pieces in this film were nothing short of exceptional. As for Brad Pitt's performance and the way in which Death is portrayed, Death would really be that mellow and calm, cause I mean you have to live with being the bearer of the worst news possible for everyone who ever existed, you gonna be mellow ok?! I will live my life by this film, and those who discard it should take a look at what they want in life and watch this film again and again and again"

","Both Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt give excellent performances.  It's a wonder neither of them was nominated for an Academy Award.  Claire Forlani also does a good job, but is far overshadowed by Pitt and Hopkins.<br/><br/>The plot is mostly believable.  It is entertaining to see Death (Pitt) react to input from his five human senses and adjust to them.  These inputs bring him very close to being fully human, thus confusing his job of ""taking people"" when their time comes to die.  The camera angles change as Death becomes more ""human.""<br/><br/>I especially appreciated the movie's comments on what life and love are. They are definitely NOT trite, and leave the viewer with plenty of food for thought.  I'm not much of a fan of love stories, but this one grabbed my interest, largely due to the characters involved.  A love affair with Death is not everyday fare!<br/><br/>Lastly, the score is also excellent.  It complemented screen action well.<br/><br/>This movie is highly recommended, especially for those who enjoy intellectual stimulation and philosophical debate."

","Enjoyable but long movie with a competent cast led by Hopkins & Pitt. Despite the retelling I found the chemistry between Forlani & Brad Pitt did work. I was also impressed by a marked improvement in his acting abilities. Theres hope for the man yet. Without giving too much away this premise of the spectre of death coming to earth in human form and mixing with us mortals is an intriguing one. What if he liked the place, found a nice woman or man and decided not to return home. The thought of living an over extended life is not an unpleasant one but the question arises of the millions of sick & suffering who would welcome a quick relief to their discomfort and pain. Oh well just a thought that niggled at me afterwards. The supporting cast here give very commendable performances.

","It is apparently highly fashionable to bomb on this film. I would simply like to state that if you intend to watch meet joe black with the preconceived notion that it is a ""3 hour long, boring and sappy love story"", then by all means i suggest not seeing it because you obviously won't like it. Most of this movie's bad reviews are part of the mentality that most have that if a movie comes out of hollywood, it is supposed to appeal to all of the masses. <br/><br/>I found meet joe black an excellent reminder of our mortality as humans, and also a great example of character development. The story moved along as if it were a merchant/ivory film in a few ways in my opinion, and if you don't like those films i suggest passing this one over for something more stimulating like varsity blues or i know what you did last summer.<br/><br/>Although a bit long, i sat through the film and felt that none of the scenes in particular was a ""throw away"" except maybe the fascination with peanutbutter, which added a quirky little edge to the already dead-serious (no pun intended) joe black. If you are a person that is capable of sitting down and watching a 3 hour movie full of dialog and nothing more, then by all means i highly recommend this film, for i found it to be one of only a few love stories that is capable of pulling out an emotional reaction of the viewer on many different levels, including a fairly true representation of love, fear of mortality and the universal (if not by subconscience) ideal that as humans we simply do not want to die, but leave our mark on society or history before we go. This is a movie that takes all of these things that we believe that make us ""human"" and presents them to a cold person that knows not of human nature, and sometimes has quite a clear and true perception of life that is unclouded by emotions.<br/><br/>However if you are expecting anything along the lines of Titanic (a much inferior film), than i suggest passing this up. This is not the movie to watch with a closed mind, or simply by someone that cant appreciate similar movies of the genre."

I got lost in the story, I watch it at least once a week. Most movie's lately lack that certain Hollywood magic, that feeling of grandeur. With the exception of Pleasantville, this is the only movie I saw last year that possessed that quality. It does not rely on special effects, or cliches, it simply asks you to follow this story, and it's characters, and I did. I felt that it was Oscar material in every way, and I regret the criticism it's been forced to take.

","I have never commented on a movie before, but I can't get this movie out of my mind and heart.  It is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is a movie for those who believe in life, with all of its ups and downs. I am not a teen-age idol of Brad Pitt, and expect acting ability in an actor in spite of his incredible good looks.  In this movie I found both.  .. Brad Pitt's dual portrayal of the guy in the coffee shop and death/Joe Black is testament to the depth of his acting ability.  Contrary to the critics' opinions, I thought his portrayal of the character ""death"" was deeply emotional and powerful.  There was a quiet calmness, a depth of character and even a certain peacefulness in this character which I found consistent with the eternity of death, in contrast to the boyish charm of the guy in the coffee shop.  It almost made it seem possible that this character could exist.  Anthony Hopkins portrayal of a man who is facing death in a matter of days or hours is realistic without being morbid, and was nothing less than spectacular.  In fact, his performance makes the viewer believe that it really is possible to have no regrets if one can live a life with meaning and integrity.  Truly ""a man like you, Bill"" would have no reason to be afraid.  I have seen this film 5 times now, and each time I have found it more entrancing. If this film were one minute shorter, it would lose much of its power.  It is in the silent looks exchanged between the characters, the pauses in the dialogue and the timelessness of many of the lines which give the movie its ""haunting"" quality.  It is easy to see why the critics didn't like it--it is not a cheap Hollywood story.  The movie makes you think and demands that you take a look at your own life and your relationships with those around you.  It is a must see."

","""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of ""Death Takes a Holiday"". Brad Pitt is no Frederic March, and nothing else about this movie really measures up to the original. I guess if you haven't seen that one, you'll like this -- but I'd urge you to save your money and get or see the 1934 version instead. It's far more beautifully filmed, and better acted (though Anthony Hopkins gives a good performance in ""Meet Joe Black""). Even the tag lines - ""Joe's"" No One Can Die -- While He Loves! and ""Holiday's"" No One Can Die -- While He Makes Love! -- are identical, given the shift in meaning for the phrase ""make love"" in the last 60 years.

","You'd think that with a couple of big names like Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins this film would be watchable at least. The only highlight of this film is when Mr Pitt meets with an accident inside the first ten minutes. The film then plummets way, way down from then on. A completely ridiculous plot, an awful 'performance' from Brad (and most of the rest of the cast too) and three hours of the most tedious drivel imaginable, which gives you plenty of time to wonder how this film got past the ideas phase.

","Meet Joe Black tries very hard to be a Significant Movie, but fails miserably.  It certainly has many of the constituent parts of a classic film including a three-hour running time, a respected senior actor teamed with Hollywood heartthrobs, and an orchestral score.  Unfortunately the music is also intrusive and overly sentimental, the film is at least an hour too long, and Claire Forlani irritatingly spends most of it in tears (although Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are adequate in their roles).    <br/><br/>
Hopkins plays Bill Parrish, a media mogul squillionaire whom everybody loves.  We are expected to believe this without question, despite the fact that he is irritable, insensitive and patronisingly patriarchal towards his daughters.  The hands of fate have decreed that it is Bill's time to die, but over the millennia Death has become curious about the ways of people and offers Bill a bargain.  In return for a guided tour of the thing we know as life, Bill will be allowed to continue living for an unspecified length of time.  Of course Bill has a beautiful daughter (so Death can fall in love), a Machiavellian business partner (so Death can prove that he is really a good guy), and assorted family crises which provide the fodder for seemingly endless poignant glances. <br/><br/>Perhaps the only thing that the film gets right is the sensual undressing sequence, with Pitt and Forlani proving that incredibly slow is also incredibly sexy.  That however, is the one bright point in a movie that waffles along towards its drawn out and saccharine conclusion.  And as far as conclusions go, it's pretty lame.  Don't watch this - you've got better things to do with your life."

","I remember seeing the trailer for this movie a handful of years ago, but only saw it for the first time recently. My expectations for this film were higher than usual: with Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt highlighting a film that paints itself very clearly as philosophical rather than entertaining, I put on my 'literary analyst' cap and popped the DVD in, ready to delve into whatever notion of Death the movie was ready to explore. Even if I'd kept my standards at par, I'd still have been disappointed.<br/><br/>The obvious problem with this film is that it drags. On. And on. And on. This movie would have been absolutely incredible had there been at least an hour and a half less of it. What I was expecting was the Death character questioning or bringing about questions of mortality or family or SOMETHING. Instead he mostly wonders around with a blank stare while obscenely rich people mutter angrily behind his back. There are at least four plot lines going on simultaneously: we have Anthony Hopkins taking death around the world because apparently even Death gets bored sometime, his daughter throwing the Party of the Milennium for Daddy much to his chagrin, a backstabbing employee trying to Oust the Old Boss and Become the New Boss, and the Love Story between non-manic daughter and Death, who has found love. Right away we can (and the producers should have) eliminated the business side of things; it did nothing at all for Pitt's character, except for the last scene which, I will admit, was nicely done, and also tacked on much of the extra mileage of this movie. The love story was fairly well handled.<br/><br/>It was the ending, though, that was the final, crushing blow. After a long, long, LONG drawn-out film I was expecting at least some brilliant moment of realization, some philosophical monologue, something. No, the ending...is rushed. It's as if the director finally realized that he ran long...two and a half hours (or thereabouts; it felt like two and a half) into the film. So, instead, anything any of the characters were supposed to have learned must be inferred via subtext.<br/><br/>This had all of the potential to be an amazing film. The idea was flawless, the cast was brilliant...and it flopped. See it to believe me, but I guarantee you won't watch it twice."

Then backward glances, never co-inciding as they walk away from each other, kersplash, poor old Brad buys it in a particularly outstanding road-kill by a truck.

Anthony Hopkins is the father of the woman in the coffee shop. **end of spoiler**<br/><br/>(3)From here on in one has to deal with the most awful gaps in the scripts while people breathe and roll eyes. Claire Furlani takes the prize in this contest, anytime she is on screen she's rolling her eyes everywhere, up, down, sideways. Like she has dust in them.<br/><br/>(4) Joe Black, Mr Death must have had all 4 writers working on his dialogue because it is extraordinarily inconsistent. Sometimes he's all wise and all knowing, next thing he doesn't know the taste of peanut butter or how to kiss or even make sense with these profound new-agey pronouncements.<br/><br/>(5) What on earth does Claire (Susan)see in this shell of a man? he bears no resemblance to any conscious being and the lovemaking scene is so creepy, like Joe is making love to himself.<br/><br/>(6)Which leaves us with the rest of the cast. Anthony plays Anthony yet again, he's always enjoyable. Jeff Tambor and Marcia Gay Harden save the whole movie from itself.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous: The costs must have been astronomical, helicopters and estates and indoor swimming pools overlooking Manhattan skylines...and on.

","Not a terrible movie, but it isn't the great movie it has pretensions to being. If you're going to release a three hour epic, then more has to happen, or actors have to act better, and scripters have to script better than this.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt comes off best of the star cast, and in spite of looking like a nine-year-old Robert Redford at times, shows - for Tinseltown - a lot of subtlety, and carries off the comic angles to the script. He and Jake Weber as the creepy bad guy spark off each other well.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins does his usual irritating 'slow, slow, quick quick slow' performance, and I got the feeling that they could have shaved a welcome half hour off the running time without his pregnant - er - pauses. And, er... portentous - um - procrastinations. Get on with it, man! Stop mumbling! The script is turgid enough!<br/><br/>Clare, the totty, nods her head a lot. A hell of a lot. The face of L'Oreal 2001, I gather. I wonder how they got her to keep her head still long enough for the photos? This film may well have stalled her movie career, but at least she got three hours for her showreel.<br/><br/>The supporting cast are pretty good on the whole; Jake Weber makes the ridiculous maguffin about the company takeover almost credible. But the Quince character (Jeffrey Tambor) has no place in a global media empire, even if he did marry the boss's frumpy daughter (a good turn from Marcia Gay Harden). And the character's obviously gay; they could have ramped that up. Even the outrageous Bill-Joe relationship is not commented on by supposedly high-powered executives. Brad's too pretty!<br/><br/>The main plot about Death hanging about the old man gives you enough to think about to sustain your interest (kinda Bergman) until the immeasurably tedious and tacky party sequence. Then you stop caring, and begin to wonder about things, like:<br/><br/>If he's a media tycoon, where did he get such a terrible band? (They make James Last sound like Guns 'n' Roses)<br/><br/>Why does he spend most of his 65th birthday party in his home office when he's just retired - knowing he's going to die? <br/><br/>Why are none of the members of the board at his party, when they're all available for a phone conference? <br/><br/>Who cares whether overprivileged stuffed shirts live or die anyway?<br/><br/>And the big twist: (SPOILER)<br/><br/>Right, so Death leaves Brad Pitt's body, and takes Anthony Hopkins anyway. I read you that far. But it's got more holes than a cheese grater. How come Brad - suddenly even goofier - is physically 100%? Didn't the hospital, where the daughter Susan is such a brilliant part-time resident, hear about the accident? So do they never find Bill Parrish's body in the grounds? And do Susan and Joe - who must have to change his name - never resolve how he disappeared off the street and woke up weeks later at her Dad's party? Didn't his family miss him? And how come Death can't tie a tie, but knows enough to wash, shave, and change his boxer shorts regularly?<br/><br/>You see, you start to ask these things in the pauses and longeurs of this movie, of which there is an abundance towards the end. Someone has already mentioned the annoyance of watching the angst of the fabulously wealthy. The main problem is the time it takes to get there, and your disbelief is unsuspended about half an hour short. The plot device is strong, but not THAT strong."

","I honestly can't believe some of the reviews posted here. This film was one of the most placid, sterile, coldest cinematic texts I've ever seen. For a film like this you should create a heart first and build everything else around it. Instead Mr. Breast believes that by placing star credentials and production values above all else we the audience will be gullible enough to lovingly swallow his shallow love story. Not only that, we'll pay him 10 bucks for the privilege of doing so.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna bore anyone with the plot because there isn't one. It's just a pure waste of time. Seriously, in three hours you can manage to convey some quite profound feelings (Godfather, Shortcuts, Schindler's List) but Meet Joe Black didn't make me feel anything. It hoped to latch on to the same elements that made Titanic a smash hit (love story, length, evil fiancées, floppy hair) but least that had decent special effects to salvage its hollow characterisations. Even the car accident that provides Joe with a ticket to `our' world looks crap. Brad Pitt wasted his talents in this week affair, as did Hopkins. Both of them look as if they are quite unsure of why they are here in the first place. As for the characters that comprise of Hopkins family, well what I was just hoping for was that Joe would have a sudden change of heart and decide to kill em all for being so darn ungrateful. I really can't hack listening to rich white people complain about how horrid life is because they can't find `true love'. I don't think that you need a three-hour time frame in order to accomplish that. These are the very same things that annoyed me about Notting Hill, yet that film at least didn't take its self as seriously as this drivel.<br/><br/>As for all this talk about Claire Forlani, well yes she is one amazing looking bird but she sure can't sustain a leading female role by herself. All she did is look like a sulky rich girl drifting from room to room, suffering from major existential teenage angst. She was about as animate as my Granny's antique wardrobe. It's a case of great face but zero charisma.<br/><br/>You know what, this might have turned out into quite memorable film if ... In the end you have enough time to think about the emptiness of it all and feel like cursing yourself for having gone to see it in the first place.<br/><br/>It's not just that it's such a pointless film that annoys me. Rather more it is the actuality that it cost $90 million to subsidise this wet, soppy, nonsensical mess. If you have a great desire to see what a personification of Death may look like, I wouldn't waste my time watching this filth you may as well wait for the real thing!

","Very few films are given the opportunity to clock in at a three-hour runtime. When one does, like ""Meet Joe Black"", it's a shame that it only uses the gift of time to completely fritter away any semblance of engaging plot or characters.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Meet Joe Black"" tells the story of William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), who is visited by the entity of Death taking the body of the recently deceased Joe Black (Brad Pitt). Death makes a deal with Parrish that he'll belay that impending heart attack as long as Bill will allow him to stay in the real world. Bill's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) quickly becomes enchanted by Mr. Black, yet remains at a distance because of the strangeness of the entire ordeal.<br/><br/>This is a metaphor film, first and foremost. The metaphor is ""death is literally in the room with you"", and how does Bill Parrish react to that. Sadly, though, so much of the film is awkward and stunted because it just doesn't make sense that Joe Black could just show up out of nowhere. That is the huge hole in this story that destabilizes everything around it. I'm always up for a little suspension of disbelief when I go to the movies, but this stretched it a bit too far. For this whole thing to work, there needed to be some explanation for who or what Joe Black was, and the rules were clearly set against that. What if Black would have been a ghost who only appeared to Parrish? Might that have worked better? Something...anything...besides having Black show up out of nowhere and have the issue never get resolved.<br/><br/>Secondly, this is very much a character film in the sense that if deep, emotional characters weren't established the whole thing was going to collapse. That is exactly what transpired. Maybe this film was just a ""product of its times"" (1998), although I hate using that excuse for any film. Perhaps, though, Hopkins as ""important business man"" during the late 90s was more relatable to audiences and Pitt in an exquisite suit wooing a doe-eyed Forlani was just what viewers expected from those characters. Even if it ""played better"" during its day, though, it still isn't quality character development by any means.<br/><br/>Finally, we get to the film's length. At three hours long, this film had all the time it needed to flesh characters and explore every plot nuance. Instead, it just kind of saunters along until the very end, when some stirring music and fireworks are supposed to provide the emotional context that three hours of runtime could not.<br/><br/>Thus, I was extremely disappointed in ""Meet Joe Black"" and really found myself a bit angered at how a film given so much ""room to play with"" could screw it up so bad. It turns an interesting concept into tedium and turns great actors into bores. Not a great recipe for any film, much less one that plays everything so serious and full of gravitas."

Then with increasing horror I realise we are being subjected to a load of syrupy(?) nonsense which drags on and on and on and has this stupid STUPID sub plot about corporate shenanigans. The worst part is that the film clearly believes that it is great and important and really saying something important.

But gosh, he's so beautiful she gets off on it. Or doesn't. Why can't they make these films with a healthy dose of cynicism they had in the 1930s and 40s? Who signed off on this?

However, I kept my mind open, and as the story unfolded I found myself leaning more forward as the movie went on. It has an interesting mix of emotions, and tries to keep the feelings of the people real. Which I must say, they did a lot better job in this movie than I have seen in many other ""Chick Flicks."" As the movie went on, I found myself laughing at a few points, smiling at others, and yes, even rolling my eyes. I find Brad Pitt's role in this movie rather comical, and to avoid any spoiler I'll leave his role at that. Anthony Hopkin's role rather profound me, I've seen him in other movies before, but his role was, I'd say, perfectly performed. I'm a rather decent fan of his older works, nowadays, seeing how I was too young back then to appreciate most of the movies.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point, this is not a movie for those who are young, and when I use that word, I am politely saying ""the kids."" This movie is too deep for children, I was a rather cultured child, and this movie would of been lost on me, had I watched it back then. This is move of a movie geared towards those who are likely to know the variety of experiences, emotions, and choice words being thrown about.<br/><br/>I gave this movie 8/10 because, yes, it is a rather good movie, yes the actors are good, yes it has a lot of emotion, etc. etc. etc. This movie has a lot of good things about it. What first peeked my interest was a few choice lines (that are in the Quotes section). After that I watched the movie more closely. This movie, I feel, stands out from average ""Chick Flicks"" having sat through quite a few myself, but I watch them with open minds so I can't ever say that once I was forced. However, having said that, I refused to give it a 10/10 because, it was rather predictable at a good amount of points, I even called somethings that probably would of surprised others. I just feel, it follows the guide lines of a general ""Chick Flick"" with some great acting and changes along the way, so I can't bring myself for a 10/10.<br/><br/>My advice to others; keep an open mind when watching this, you can't take this movie literally, Brad Pitt's role in the movie is unique, and you should not ruin the movie with your own personal beliefs. It's a movie, not real life, just keep that in mind. Also, advice to the 'guys' or anyone trying to get a guy to see this, keep in mind, ""Chick Flicks"" almost always have funny stuff in the movie for the guys. This one is no exception."

","You'd think that between Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt (not to mention the inimitable Jeffrey Tambor), an at-least-decent movie would emerge, but that was regrettably not the case here. That is not to say that Hopkins and Pitt turned in bad performances; they were both what you'd expect of them: Hopkins at turns stiff and explosive, Pitt utterly chameleonic. Rather, it is the ineptitude of the writers (all FOUR of them!) and the director that fails this movie so miserably...and what is there to a movie after that? So much of this film reminded me of Peter Sellers' 'Being There,' but that movie worked with a fluid story, single-minded direction and all spot-on performances. This...well, the story is single-minded, the direction is sloppy and the performances are (at best) spotty. Even the usually excellent Pitt's character is all over the place: one moment he's naive or petulant as a 5-year-old, the next he's as omnipotent and stern as a god! Again, not his fault clearly. His performance at every turn is solid, but the turns he's given are just too much. Behind all this is a score that sounds like it's been lifted from 3 or 4 other movies. It sweeps, dips and soars often completely counter to the action on the screen. Nowhere is this more evident than in the last conversation between Hopkins and Pitt. My wife and I were convinced at any moment they were going to be pressing their faces together in a climactic kiss! But, no, it was just a chat...that went on forever. My pregnant missus was laughing so hard, she felt certain it was going to induce labour! The writers of this movie should've stuck to TV scripts. It's clearly what they do best. Too much of this story was too trite, and too much of the dialogue sounded like it was pieced together from greeting cards. The best example of this is Hopkins early speech to Forlani on the plane, regarding looking for true love. That monologue jumps from one cliché to the next, as though the writers stood in a drugstore on Valentine's Day, rifling through a rack of niceties and copying down the insides. I gave it a 4 out of the IMDb 10, and that mainly because it wasn't '""Manos"": The Hands of Fate,' and did have a pretty solid core cast. But do yourself a favour: avoid this movie. I watched it with my wife (though at my own suggestion, I'm ashamed to say), and it's truly surprising we both made it through all three hours of this dreck. Don't do the same. Go watch any of the number of other better movies either Hopkins or Pitt have done...then just put the quality together in your mind. You'll be a better person for it. I only wish we'd done the same."

","Anthony Hopkins is resplendent and regal as a 65-year old communications tycoon who wakes one morning with pains and is hearing voices; turns out his time has come to check out, but the personification of Death (""a kid in a suit"", Hopkins says) has decided to take a vacation and allow Hopkins a chance to say goodbye. The 1934 movie ""Death Takes a Holiday"", which was based on a hit play from the 1920's, was certainly ripe for a re-imagining, and that job has been accomplished here very well. Brad Pitt's Grim Reaper is a bit like Peter Sellers in ""Being There"", a wide-eyed innocent and fish-out-of-water; to his credit however, Pitt doesn't rely on coy shtick and has a few excellent moments (particularly with an ill Jamaican woman in the hospital). A romantic subplot between Pitt and Hopkins' youngest daughter is handled with exasperating taste, prolonging the proceedings to an inordinate length (and capping the movie with a ridiculous final ten minutes), but Anthony's glorious performance remains the centerpiece of the film and it's worth watching just to see the master at work. **1/2 from ****"
"cbhasin","Null","2","4","13 February 2005"," To live life to the fullest, you need to have loved
","""To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived."" This line delivered by William Parrish (played by Anthony Hopkins) in his customary charismatic and empowering way, encapsulates pretty much everything the movie is about. The way this thought is explored through the progress of the movie is very innovative, in terms of the personification of 'death' and the concept of 'his' being on vacation.<br/><br/>This movie talks about the life of a man who is, in essence, a success story. He is someone who believes in living life to the fullest and he wants people who he loves, to be the same way. He is a risk taker in every aspect of life and he strongly believes in taking all the drawbacks in his stride and thereafter bouncing back. His biggest weakness is his love for his daughter 'Susan' played by Claire Forlani. His love for her is so strong that it takes over him to the extent that he almost finds it hard to respect any of her decisions. This leads to him trying to control her life and decisions, though he has only good intentions at heart, while trying to maneuver her life, so that it can be ""perfect"" or at least what he thinks is perfect.<br/><br/>It is at this point that 'death' played by Brad Pitt walks into the scene in the body of a human being called 'Joe Black'. The purpose of his visit was to explore the human world and he chose 'William Parrish"" , to be his guide through this journey for two reasons; one being that Parrish was the perfect embodiment of a knowledgeable, successful and happy man and the other being that he wanted to pick someone who had lived his/her life to the fullest so he would be justified in taking him/her away from this world at the end of his 'vacation'.<br/><br/>What I loved about the movie was how ironic it was that whatever Parrish tried to convince Susan about living life, came back to haunt him as she decided to take the plunge by falling madly in love with the one person that only Parrish knew was 'death' and not suitable for her. It was amazing see a man who was not afraid of dying actually fear death because he did not want to let go of life until he was assured that his daughter was in good hands.<br/><br/>Another fascinating aspect of the movie was how 'death', in the short time that he spent in the real world, learned about love and sacrifice. As he explored the concepts of emotions and feelings, he grew attached to Susan and in due course of time was convinced he loved her. Despite Bill Parrish's continued effort to persuade him to not ruin Susan's life, he was stubborn in his will to be with her and take her with him. But even death, in his most ominous self, realized one of the strongest challenges in loving someone uninhibitedly; sacrificing something for the well being of the one you love. As this dawned upon him towards the end of the movie, he decided to leave Susan on earth and give her the chance to live life to its fullest. I feel that, it is in this act that the film maker tries to set 'death' as an example for us mortals and show us the right way to live and love.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to everyone mainly because it gives you a perspective on life and death and how everyone has his or her 'time' in this world."

That said, if you want to be totally convinced that Brad Pitt is popular solely for his looks and not his acting, this is could be your primary evidence.

"Rathko","3","2","4","15 December 2004"," From The Director Who Brought You Gigli
","An acquaintance recently insisted that I watch Meet Joe Black, his favorite movie and one that he was sure would change my life. I remembered it as being a critically reviled movie that prompted one of two responses  it's so bad it's good, or it's so bad it'sjust bad. <br/><br/>Meet Joe Black is quite possibly one of the worst movies that I've ever had to endure. The script, or the mess that resulted from reassembling the shredded remains of a dozen rewrites, was so bad as to be funny. On several occasions, my wife and I laughed out loud at the mock sincerity and vapid attempts at 'meaning' and 'depth'. The entire thing sounds like the laughable doom laden poetry of a maudlin teenager. The actors, left with nothing of any substance to work with, and operating under a director who clearly has intellectual aspirations far above his capabilities, struggle to create characters that amount to anything more than shameless pouting and vacant stares into the middle distance. <br/><br/>Buried beneath the portentous dialogue, the awkward performances, the dull production design and wildly inconsistent storyline, there IS a kernel of a decent story. Had we been able to focus on Joe Black and follow his own emotional journey as he weaves between the variously dysfunctional members of the Parrish family, playing with the irony of death healing these people's wounds, something of value may have resulted, but alas, it's not to be. Even my wife, a hardcore fan of every romance put to screen, found the whole thing to swing wildly from embarrassment to tedium.<br/><br/>The blame for this entire mess can only be laid at the feet of Martin Brest, a director of very little evident talent who created a reasonably enjoyable buddy cop movie 20 years ago and has been riding on the wake of it's success ever since. He should stop deluding himself, his actors and audiences, that he is capable of subtlety or intelligence. Hopefully, Gigli will be the death of him.<br/><br/>As for a rating, let's give it a 3 out of 10, out of respect for capable actors put in an impossible situation."
"TxMike","Null","2","4","22 January 2004"," 'Easy, Bill, you'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.' ","This movie, 'Meet Joe Black, and a 1934 movie, 'Death Takes a Holiday', are both based on (or inspired by...) the stage play. The 'Ultimate' DVD set I got from my public library has two disks, one with the almost 3-hour 'Meet Joe Black' movie and the other with the barely 80 minutes 1934 'Death Takes A Holiday' movie.  So I didn't have to move very far from my home theater to see both of them. They are distinctly different, and end quite differently, but both are enjoyable. I will write a separate review of the 1934 movie. Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt occupy the main roles, and Hopkins is especially effective as the business man about to turn 65 and visited by this unlikely guest. It is a bit slow in spots, spending too much time on intimate scenes between Forlani and Pitt, and also too much time getting through the final scenes, but overall a very watchable if overly long movie.<br/><br/>SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS are contained in the remaining comments, don't read any further, OK??<br/><br/>Bill (Hopkins)is almost 65 and is experiencing a heart attack, when 'death' (Brad Pitt) shows up, gets named 'Joe Black', wants a holiday, and asks Bill to be his guide of sorts. In return, Bill will not die until after he has turned 65, has a chance to really say farewell to all his family and friends, and prepare for his fate. 'Death' occupies the body of the young man that Bill's doctor daughter Susan (Forlani) had met briefly in a coffee shop, but who was killed right after she turned a corner, not seeing any of it. <br/><br/>Joe is at Bill's side everywhere, to the consternation of Drew, the business hotshot that is trying to marry Susan, and at the same time engineer a merger which would enrich him personally but destroy the business that Bill had put together over the years. Things are complicated when Joe and Susan fall in love, she doesn't know who he really is, Bill knows this is not good for Susan. Drew convinces the board to fire Bill, but at Bill's birthday party he tricks Drew into admiting his plan to the board over a speaker phone, to set things right. Joe, posing as an IRS agent, tells Drew, 'death and taxes' as Drew is forced to resign to avoid prosecution, echoing a line Drew told to Joe early in the movie. As midnight approaches, Joe and Bill walk together over an arched walk, Bills time is up, Joe's holiday is ending. But Joe apparently comes back, but it isn't Joe anymore, it is the young man that Susan had met in the coffee shop. 'Death' decided it wasn't his time, so gave him back to Susan, as a gesture of his love for her, instead of taking Susan with him."
"stamper","8","2","4","21 May 2003"," A chronically underused Forlani shines between Pitt and Hopkins
","Meet Joe Black is one of those films, that did not exactly was the way I expected the film to be. This, I am certain had a lot to do with the nature of the trailer and the things I've heard other people say about it. Just to maker it clear: yes Meet Joe Black is something of a romantic film and yes it is probably best enjoyed (especially at certain moments) with your girlfriend, but there is much more to this film that just the romantic side. This film is also funny, enchanting (in a non-romantic way), utterly entertaining and intriguing. The credit for creating a compelling story, that never gets boring (despite the films length), certainly must be given to Martin Brest (of Beverly Hills Cop fame), but he couldn't have done it without his actors and one actress in particular. Brad Pitt (Joe Black) and Anthony Hopkins (Bill Parrish) certainly are the main focus of the story, because it the main point is an agreement they both have and the story between Bill's daughter Susan (Claire Forlani) is just' a by product of that. But I will not focus too much on the story, as most of you will probably know that Pitt plays death who has come to earth to get Parrish, whose time has come. Instead I'd like to focus on the great people in from of the screen. Now most of you / us know that Brad Pitt is a wonderful actor and I must truly say that he is able to show it here again. His portrayal of death experiencing what it is to be alive for the first time was really great and I must say that I thought he even outperformed Hopkins. This is not to say that Anthony Hopkins was bad, on the contrary he was good, but just not as top notch as Pitt. Standing there right between those two like a hill between the mountains was Claire Forlani, who was exceptionally well cast as young Susan. I think not enough credit has been given to this beautiful young lady. I think it is quite an accomplishment to stand in the middle between Hopkins and Pitt and still be able to stand tall and not be blown away by the talent and ability those two actors possess. I also think it is a pity that an actress so beautiful and talented has not been cast in bigger, more successful films in the past 5 years. What kind of films are the casting people looking for references anyway? Forlani would rule as a Bond girl, she could play an Austin Powers film, she could even do great character work in A Beautiful Mind like film if someone would let her. I admit that she's too cute for some parts, hey but there must be other roles out there for her than the one she's getting lately. I admit that she does some low budget films, but as all actors and actresses I'm certain that she'd like to be in big production every now and then like she has been in The Rock and Meet Joe Black. Therefore and because I think she's a good actress I hope that The Limit (with Jackie Chan) will do her career some good and that she'll get more credit for her work as an actress besides that Saturn Nomination for Meet Joe Black for I feel that she is CHRONICALLY UNDERUSED in good and big productions that can make her name a household one. I mean she certainly starred with some good and famous actors the past few years, but why must the productions always be so cheap and bad?<br/><br/>
While I was going on and on (sorry to have bored you) about Claire Forlani, I mentioned a nomination for a Saturn Awards in Meet Joe Black. A few Saturn Award nominations were actually the only indications of this films quality, which makes me wonder if anyone of the academy or golden globe folks have watched this film? I for one, feel that Pitt and Forlani should at least have gotten Globe nominations and I also feel that there cloud have been an Oscar nomination for the wonderful Cinematography or the set decoration. But since this film got nothing but a few Saturn nominations, a worst remake nomination and an award for worst film I MUST BE MAD. Even if I am, I still know I liked it from beginning to end.<br/><br/>

","To be fair, I should admit that I haven't actually seen this entire film: my wife and I left after about an hour, unable to stand the torture any more. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.<br/><br/> From the hackneyed use of ""media baron"" as a central character; to Brad Pitt's apparent decision to abandon all actual acting technique, and simply hope that his soulful staring and preening will tell us all we need to know about his character (it worked for me - I believed that he was a moron) - very little about this film appealed to me.<br/><br/>And let me see if I've got this straight: Death, who has absolute dominion over the fate of every living organism who will ever live, falls into a catatonic euphoria over peanut butter?!  Come on!  Give us a Death who is so jaded by his power, that he can barely resist the temptation to monkey with people's lives once he makes an appearance in the material world - and then - yes, I could stand it for the sake of marketability - have the true love of an unforgettable woman awaken him to all that is miraculous about ""our"" world.  Don't give us Forrest Gump in a saggy suit.<br/><br/>In sum, I found this remake too ""by-the-numbers"" to be anything special. It's almost as if the makers simply checked off the ingredient list from a Recipe for a Successful Date Movie: ""Mix together a formidable foreign actor, a bankable Hollywood pretty boy, and a gorgeous young starlet. Have them play rich and beautiful people.  Sprinkle in some quasi-mystical mumbo jumbo. Hope for movie magic.""<br/><br/>Didn't happen for me here ..."

","I guess this movie is for people who like to watch make-believe rich people and fantasize about how they must live. So by all means, cast it with pretty Brad Pitt, Claire Gooeylani and Anthony Hopkins, who has worked his way up from a butler in some other movie.<br/><br/>Hopkins, who probably couldn't screw up a role even if he tried, is the only character in the movie who doesn't come off making you crave sucking on toilet paper soaked in imitation maple syrup. Pitt plays the ""Angel of Death"" sorta... How clever to have the Grim Reaper act cuuuuute!<br/><br/>Oh, there's some sort of storyline, some kind of high-falutin' big deal message to the movie about (who would guess?) LOVE, and well, yawn. Claire What's-her-lani plays Hopkin's character's daughter who happens to be a doctor, and I guess it's supposed to be meaningful that a doctor falls in love with Mr. Death, although when I mentioned that to the people who watched the movie with me, they just laughed. Maybe the two have a love affair just so you can get all dewey and fuzzy watching such cute people mumble at each other and make cow eyes.<br/><br/>And I gotta hand it to them, 'cause it was one of the dewey and fuzziest fall-for-me scenes. Oooh, that ULTRA SOFT voice that Claire ???Lani has! I don't know, is that some kinda electronic effect that they use? She sounded like a persian kitten purring in a down sleeping bag on a hot summer day, and was about as easy to understand. Is that supposed to be sexy or something? Is that the way she really talks? With that pencil neck of hers, I'd expect more of a squeak. Shows what I know.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for people locked into a trailer park lifestyle, to get some ideas going on how they're gonna spend their lottery winnings. Oh, those rich people are SOOOO fuzzy!"

Joe Black is a fiesta of love and life, a reflective and philosophical tale.<br/><br/>Yesterday was the 3rd time, I watched this film.
It reminded me of the good old days, a young college student thinking about exploring the world and falling in love. I had dreams which I want to live. I want to sell my talent to the world. I want to prove myself, I considered innocence is the art to captivate each and every detail of life but the world out there was harsh, full of predators. Well, I had my own moments.

Emotions which words can't express, eyes do.<br/><br/>In short, Meet Joe Black is timeless classic, an exploration of love and emotional separation.

","""This is crazy,"" says Anthony Hopkins's character Bill Parrish, a billionaire media mogul to titular character Joe Black, at a fairly early stage of this extraordinarily long remake of the clever, 1934 relatively short film, Death Takes a Holiday. He already knew something many viewers probably didn't. They were in for a very extended, lengthy, muddled ride watching a hugely tedious, undramatic and unromantic film, whereby Death (Joe Black - Brad Pitt) drops into the Land of the Free, to be tutored in ways human, by Bill Parrish and later, his lovely daughter Susan.<br/><br/>Producer/director Martin Brest had a relatively brief ride amongst the Hollywood elites. He made 2 very good action comedies, Beverly Hills Cop and Midnight Run and an OK drama, in Scent of a Woman, all consecutively. From there, starting from this film it was all downhill, ending terminally with the catastrophic Gigli. He hasn't really been heard from since. All the signs pointing to a decline are on show here in this ponderous, pretentious affair.<br/><br/>For a start considering it was made in 1998 for a then, pretty staggering $90 million, it's one of those productions where you just can't see where the money has gone. It does have some opulent sets and locations in a Rhode Island mansion, but so do other films with much smaller budgets. Salaries? Reshoots? I don't know, but unsurprisingly it was a troubled shoot.<br/><br/>It has 2 extremely bankable stars in Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. Hopkins is as serviceable as ever and undoubtedly would entertain reading a telephone directory. Pitt is not miscast, but I feel hopelessly misdirected. He is asked to play Death as this naive, virginal, neophyte, when the opposite, most certainly could have applied. The eternal Grim Reaper should have been seen as being the epitome of intelligence, charm and attractive menace, especially after his early library introduction with Parrish, when he is invisible. This results in a couple of hours of ""awkward"" between Pitt and co-star Claire Forlani (who really tries her hardest) as Susan, instead of rebirthing the sexy chemistry, we'd been led to believe had been established by the earlier cafe scenes. And speaking of ""awkward"", how about that absurd road accident? Junkies, drunks, fugitives from the law maybe, but sane individuals don't stand in the middle of a busy road, completely love-struck and wait patiently to be run over.<br/><br/>There are sub-plots; which have all the repetition and dramatic heft of your regular daytime TV soaps. I'd like a dollar for every time we saw Pitt and Hopkins standing/sitting bemusedly in a board room meeting in Meet Joe Black. And Marcia Gay Harden's character of Allison, Susan's sister, is (for a 3 hour film), ironically underwritten and generally ill-used.<br/><br/>Laughably Martin Brest apparently took offence at some of the airlines and TV stations who tried to do him a favour and did their own 2 hour edits of the movie. Seems he was incapable of picking up the message that there may have been a few decent ideas in Meet Joe Black that should have been delivered in a more simple and lean package."

It's a very long three hour movie but the ending's payoff is very well worth the watch! There's a shorter version out there if you're willing to search for it due in part to airplane viewings when the film first came out. Lots of great undertone humor that highlights Pitt's upcoming acting career. You should enjoy this one if you have a good heart 💓"

","I'd heard of ""Meet Joe Black"" before, but I couldn't concentrate to watch it, because of the longevity of the movie. However, I found myself captivated from the first minute to the last. It's played by my favorite actors- Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins. After watching it, I can say that it is a beautiful movie, which contains a lot of dialogues that can be influential for viewers. It is truly a masterpiece, and I am impressed by this movie's main concept. More specifically, we see how death, who takes the form of a young man, asks a media mogul to act as a guide to teach him about life on Earth and in the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter. We see how death decides to stay longer on Earth only for understanding his feelings towards the woman. However, I also like the part when they show that Death becomes more lively and wants to do right things not only towards the mogul's daughter but also towards all. In particular, Death saves their family business, and he might not have done it, because he represents itself something selfish and unfeeling. Another part where we see his changed character is when he helps the grandmother, who has little to live. Accordingly, the movie teaches us that even Death became kinder based on human feelings and other people's attitude towards him. Thus, I liked specifically this concept of the movie, because it is significant for our understanding. It demonstrates that even a selfish person can change if he witnesses such a relationship of people who care about each other."

","Haven't seen this movie in a while and took it out the other day. I still like it from start to finish. Anthony Hopkins, I thought, was really good. He played the fine line between big shot rich guy and good guy really well. Showing plenty of both at the right time. Claire Forlani was excellent. Really liked her in this. As the sort of young (She's a doctor) woman who's still really looking for Mr. Right, and in the end she finds him, she played the whole thing really well. Jeffery Tambor is another one of my favorites. He's played so many good roles over the year. I'd like to meet him some day and just ask him about his career. The only thing i sort of didn't like is how 'death' - Brad Pitt - is so clueless about how the world works. He's been there forever, yet doesn't know what peanut butter is, and other things that you would think he would pick up on , as spirit who is ages old. However, in the end, I think the feel good part of this movie is that we all hope that this is how death happens. You are suddenly met by someone who leads you on - no fear - just a passage to meet old friends and relatives who have already gone."

Anthony Hopkins was amazing as always, he played his character perfectly. Brad Pitt I also thought was great, I love how he basically got to play two different characters and he played them both so differently, his marvel at all the things of this world was cute and funny, almost like a kid who was learning about life as he grew up.

"RyanWinter100","7","0","0","24 May 2016"," Beautiful film to watch.
","I'm not a big fan of love stories. I only like two--""UNTAMED HEART"" and ""MEET JOE BLACK."" They are on opposite ends of the spectrum in the sense of story and production. UNTAMED HEART is a relatively low budget movie shot in a way to make it feel real. It was filmed in a real middle-class neighborhood and the characters were lower middle class. It was an absolutely sweet story. MEET JOE BLACK is all about extreme wealth, very beautiful powerful people, and the whole story is a fantasy. In both films, the couple in love project innocence and are compelling to watch. In a interview, Brad Pitt said that his mother wanted to see him a movie in which he looked good. Well, he never looked better. The girl is just as lovely and charming as any film character created for the screen. The only way to watch this film is just to buy into it and enjoy each frame. If you analyzed the story seriously, it's full of holes. So don't ruin your experience. Just listen to the beautiful score, engage the credible performances, embrace the classically simple but effective directing, and as with any good love story worth it's salt, bring a box of Kleenex."

","This is one of my all time favorite films. Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are amazing actors, who really capture your attention through out the whole film. The story, about what is true love, what does it mean to live, and finally what awaits after death is very interesting. What i really liked about the film, was that Death wasn't the antagonist, but what just another being trying to understand the complexity of life. While Drew played by Jake Weber was the typical type of human who was after greed. The acting in the film was great from the main cast to the supporting actors. The story never let you go or got boring, and the cinematography was really wonderful as well. This is hands down one of the classic films that people should watch. Well in my opinion at least."

","A timeless classic and a update of how to make a movie. Should be a mainstay in school or anybody in the business or entering it. The big plot isn't the thing here it's the scenes with Susan and Jo that are the mastery, if you watch carefully they are a joy, kind of thing that rarely happens in that last 20 years. All we have now is The Intern and Quentintoo Taratinooo, seems love stories are hard work or expensive to Hollywood, but to be fair there aren't that many Brad Pitts around and this movie is all him, just nice for all the right reasons.

","I originally saw this in the theatre with my husband who fidgeted and laughed his way through it. He absolutely hated it, let everyone know it and talked about what a terrible movie it was for years afterwards. I didn't dislike it then and in re-watching it (by myself) now I really liked and appreciated it. Sure it's too long, with so many scenes stretched out that it could easily have been pared back to a 2 hour viewing time but the story itself about family and the meaning of love, about discovery, seizing the day and sacrifice is just beautiful.<br/><br/>The plot is intriguing and has apparently been done before in 'Death Takes A Holiday' which might explain why this had such an old fashioned feel to it, style, music and even dialogue. It follows the grim reaper, who comes to earth to retrieve a media tycoon shortly before his 65th birthday, but agrees to grant him a little more time if the mogul will teach him about life. In the process he falls in love with his guide's daughter.<br/><br/>Stand out performances from everyone involved, I love watching Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt together on screen (Legends Of The Fall) they have fantastic chemistry and once again Pitt is almost too good looking here. Excellent back up cast too, Claire Forlani as the love interest is lovely in a simple trusting way, Marcia Gay Harden, trying to get her father to notice her and I loved Jeffrey Tambor's character Quince, such a nice man. As Joe Black says ""one of my favourites."" The character of Black must have been a hard one to play and I'm not sure Pitt ever quite got it right, he just felt awkward at times in his wide eyed, robotic and childlike portrayal, in his discovery of life's pleasures and quest for more peanut butter. I will say he provided one of the most ...interesting love scenes I've witnessed on screen, watching death get it on, feeling things for the first time. Oh my! Ultimately a thoughtful, wonderful mixture of comedy, romance and drama that left me thinking about it for days afterwards. 7/27/15"

","""Meet Joe Black"" is one of two Brad Pitt movies which deal with the theme of human limits. A decade later followed ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,"" a story about a man who ages backwards. When we compare these two films, we see clearly how Pit has remained true to the quality of his performance; the actor is able to present the most complex characters with a timeless dimension. How much you will enjoy the movie depends on your acceptance of the (un)reality of the plot. The truth is that, behind the actions, lies a series of moments that will define why you love movies. The symbolism should be evaluated, how we all need to look back in our life, make a balance of what we have achieved and tell ourselves: ""I am satisfied"". There's an emotional core and good intentions that extends through the entire two and a half hours. I do not remember that I watched the story of death recorded with so many lives."

Everything else was just dumb, unrealistic, Hollywood cliché kind of stuff. Everyone who liked this movie a 100%, was just fascinated with how pretty and cute the protagonists looked together.Superficial BS.Yes it had a good message about life and how we should not take it from granted, but I don't think we need 3 hours of our time to be reminded of that.

From start to finish she simpers and bridles either through plain bad acting or in a gargantuan effort to look adorably doll like throughout the whole thing. Perhaps she overdid the botox, or suffered from constipation while filming. Whatever it was, she slaughtered the role and how Brad kept his pecker up during his scenes with her, I'll never know. <br/><br/>Apart from that, a great film, fascinating concept, and the rest of the cast were excellent.

","Lets face it, Brad Pitt is easy on the eyes and ears and when you can catch Anthony Hopkins too, its a watcher! The premise is good as well as the story too. The pacing is deliberately slowed down because it is connected to the storyline which is death. Don't ask too many questions on the movie itself when it is over because it may go into places where there are little or no answers. It is fantasy entertainment and delights the viewer allowing one to escape. Isn't that what we pay for? Good supporting actors as well. There is humor on nothing less than the subject of death and taxes which I found cute and appropriate for the movie.

","Barring the logic and reasoning, the movie succeeds in describing and appreciating life to an uninitiated. It is not a sci-fi, more of philosophical and drama with a touch of fantasy. Great direction and acting, All characters played their part to the best. It had some powerful quotes and some moving scenes. ""Lightning could strike"" and ""multiple with infinity and take it to depth..."" were my favorite ones. The best parts were Brad meeting Susan in coffee shop and being too frank and straight forward (not sure if in real world that would work, but hey! u never know, lightning could strike!). Second one was when Joe kissed Susan the first time, I can imagine how ""death"" would have felt, such strong emotions. If such a thing happened to u, u'd want to freeze it forever."

","I have watched this movie so many times I do not have to watch the screen to understand what is taking place. Yes, it is a drama featuring Anthony Hopkins as the top notch business executive who has everything you could want, but death steps in. He begins to suffer painful heart attacks, but for some reason the voice he hears in his head works out a plan for the two of them. The initial dialogue is very well set so with the entrance of Brad Pitt your interest is peaked. But, even though this is listed as a good drama with interactions between death and the main character; it is the side story of death learning what life is all about, including love. Claire Forlani is excellent as the quiet daughter who becomes very fond of the reincarnated young man she met in a restaurant. Their interaction is a classic love story. I will not explain how the story ends because, folks you just have to watch this movie!"
"Lee-568","10","0","0","7 November 2014"," This Movie is a Master Class on What it Means to Love.
","This movie is in my top five movies of all time. In the ""making of"" documentary you hear about how the director would sometimes take a scene 20 times to get it just right. It shows! Every single scene is like something from a museum--perfection personified. The script, direction, cinematography, music are all examples of how a movie can be a true work of art. I can find almost no fault with this movie. The acting is top notch, although I think Brad Pitt's acting here is not quite up to the quality of all the others.<br/><br/>I just read a favorite review of another reviewer who loved this film and says that this is a movie about death. I respectively disagree. This is not at all a film about death, it is a film about love. I tell people, if you want to experience what love really is or really means, this is the movie for that--not in some romantic comedy kind of way--but a real philosophical experience and discussion of what it means to truly love. There are many characters experiencing their loving relationships in various ways and so many examples, discussions, and experiences of love, that to me this is a Master Class in what it means to love or be loved. The preoccupation about death is natural, since the main character is Death, wanting to experience human life, but in that experience, he thinks he falls in love, but he has no idea what that means. It takes the three hours of this movie (so well spent!) for him to be shown and taught what it really means to love. This movie is a classic. Of course it didn't do well at the box office. Works of great philosophical significance rarely do. I can only promise you, your life will be enriched after seeing this film and you will think about it long after--I sure did--after every viewing (about six so far)."

","Inspired by Death Takes A Holiday, a classic stage play that many of my generation read as teens for either English or Drama class in high school, this film marks, for me, the coming of age of Brad Pitt as an actor with depth. I know some people will point to A River Runs Through It, or even Seven Years In Tibet as the films where Brad showed true ability, but Death Takes a Holiday is a pivotal film where he has to reach into the unknown and his past to portray a ""stranger in a strange land."" and he does it with a remarkable freshness and style. As an amateur actor, I know the importance of any production is to give the audience the illusion of the first time. Brad does that beautifully in this film.<br/><br/>Of course, it doesn't hurt that he is surrounded by an incredible cast, lead by the incomparable Anthony Hopkins. Jake Webber demonstrates his range as well, as do both Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor. Somewhere beyond perfect is Claire Forlani's portrayal of Susan Parrish, the younger daughter and medical resident who is attracted to Pitt's character, first in his portrayal of the young attorney freshly arrived in the big city, and then as Death personified in Joe Black.<br/><br/>The plot is straightforward, the photography exceptional (try filming a sex scene without revealing any body parts that shouldn't be seen), and the sets are exquisite examples of architecture. While certainly not an action film, the film moves forward briskly, without needless exposition or character development beyond what is needed. Rated PG-13, thanks to that incredible photography, this is a film for contemplation and reflection, and offers no religious allegories to good or evil. I own a copy, and I think it will be regarded as collectible."

The opening scene is a wonderful scene that actors might want to try in class, Forlani oozes with vulnerability and sexuality and Pitt who plays kind of a naive but sincere kid looking for work in the big city really shows his talent and why he is an accomplished actor today.

","I really liked this movie when i first saw it. It's almost 3 hours long, but that doesn't take a thing away from it. It's an interesting plot - death falling in love with a human being. Of course they had to get Brad Pitt to play that one thing that we humans will never escape. If they Danny Bonaduce play the lead part, it wouldn't have been such a winner, IMHO. Claire Forlani, who plays Susan Parrish, has the most beautiful pair of eyes in moviedom! I am awestruck by them, and can't get enough seeing her in movies so i can get another view of them. The rest of her is very beautiful, too. Anthony Hopkins (Bill Parrish) gave a great performance in this role of the communications tycoon who gets a few last days to enjoy himself on earth. It's a pretty good flick, with some funny parts mixed in. One of the oddball parts of the movie is Death's love for peanut butter. Certain scenes show him with a spoon sticking out of his mouth.<br/><br/>There is one part of the movie which confused me from the get go. Death inherited the body of Pitt's initial character, who is a patron of a coffee shop. After that character met Susan Parrish, and the two hit it off immediately, he gets flustered enough by her beautiful eyes and body to be stopped in the middle of the street, looking at her as she leaves the scene. Well, who hasn't been in that situation, your eyes and ears not paying attention to your surroundings because of a beautiful person who happened to catch your eye, and before you know it, you walk into something, or someone. Well, in this case, a car slams into the guy, killing him. Death inherits his body, and that's how he got around in the movie. Well, at the end of the movie, the person from the accident scene returns from the dead. He is seen talking to Susan, and seems confused how he had gotten where they were. I am just wondering why the director threw that part in there. Why did they choose to bring back a character from the dead? So we romantics would get teary-eyed, knowing that those two characters would be together again? OR, maybe that Death may let some of us escape, just when it seems as though our goose is cooked? It was interesting that they chose that ending, to say the least. Anyway, this movie is highly recommended!"

","10 out of 10 for me too, Mr. Sponseller. Some trivia first. Two of my favorite movies star both Pitt and Hopkins. The other one being ""After the Fall"" of course. And I just noticed the other night that ""Twelve Monkeys"", for which Brad Pitt won a Golden Globe, also contains Louie Armstrong's ""What a Wonderful World"". ""Meet Joe Black"" is on satellite a lot, and I watch it most of those times. I bought the sound tract CD, for Thomas Newman's beautiful music. Susan and Joe are staring at each other to Newman's music right now, and Pitt does this so well. Claire Forlani, also. The two scenes with the old Haitian lady were just so damn good, too. I wonder whether that was one scene, and seeing it, Brest thought: ""We have to have more of this"". Bravo to Martin Brest, who directed some other great films. Great cast here. Jeffrey Tambor is perfect as ""Quince"", a complex character. No, he's not a pedophile; just a sentimental guy who knows he married well. The look that Marcia Gay Hardin's Alison gives him at the dinner table is priceless. Wrapping this up, the handsome, talented kid from Missouri continues to do fine work."
"MarieGabrielle","8","0","0","20 November 2007"," Anthony Hopkins excels....once again
","I admit the film is a bit over drawn and there are a few blank moments. However, the performance of Mr. Hopkins adds his charisma and cadence, as when he realizes he is facing his own death, and remembers his deceased wife from twenty years earlier.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt is surprisingly good as 'Death' (Joe Black). Reminiscent of ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (Gig Young, circa 1965). A beautiful looking man who brings the ultimate horror to us all. It is not a complex plot and has been done.<br/><br/>There are, however, some nuances as the relationship between Marcia Gay Harden, the less favored daughter and Hopkins, a media magnate who is preparing for his final birthday. There are several clichés, but the visuals and performances by Hopkins and Pitt somewhat transcend this.<br/><br/>Occasionally, over-analyzing a film cannot garner further knowledge, accept it at face value and enjoy. It is, after all, only a movie, not a play.<br/><br/>8/10."
"steve-hatchard","10","0","0","18 October 2007"," My favourite film of all time
","This film has had such a polarised response from audiences and critics. You either absolutely love it or absolutely hate it. However, it is my favourite movie ever and here are my reasons why :- <br/><br/>** CONTAINS SPOILERS ** <br/><br/>1) It is 3 hours long. What many believe to be its biggest fault is I believe its biggest strength. It takes its time to develop a story. You live with these characters. You enter their world and experiences. In the age of fast editing, 30 second attention span, car chase, explosion entertainment, it is refreshing to have a film that gives the audience time between lines and scenes to absorb the story. We all have such hectic lives, it actually is essential to take time out and watch films such as these.<br/><br/>2) Thomas Newman delivers his best soundtrack ever (and he has created some classic and innovative ones - American Beauty, Shawshank Redemption, etc). The Newman family's contribution to movie music is immense but this sits at the top of that very prestigious combined body of work. The main Joe Black theme manages to be both haunting, yearning, melancholic and hopeful at the same time. The final 10 minutes is just sublime. As near perfect an arrangement of music you will ever find in cinema. Then, the credits roll to the beautiful segue of Somewhere Over The Rainbow/What a Wonderful World by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. The juxtaposition of the triumphant celebratory orchestra crescendo to such a naked track is just phenomenal. If you add to that Whisper of a Thrill, Someone Else and Mr Bad News, this is genius music that will last forever.<br/><br/>3) It has so many poignant moments <br/><br/>a) ""Cold Lamb Sandwiches"" – loss and grief accompanied by melancholy piano<br/><br/>b) ""But I not lonely here""<br/><br/>c) ""65 years...don't they go by in a blink"". Yep they do, so make the most of each day. Joe Black could visit you tomorrow.<br/><br/>d) ""It's hard to let go isn't it. Yes it is Bill. Well that's life what can I tell you"". You don't get dialogue like that in Gone in 60 seconds!<br/><br/>e) ""Should I be afraid?...Not a man like you"".<br/><br/>4) In Anthony Hopkins - we have the finest actor of his generation, if not ever, (and I am big fans of De Niro, Pacino, Newman, Hoffman and Hackman too), who can convey the power of the big corporate media mogul, the doting father, the not-so-doting father, fear and shock, anger, comedy, wistful mourning. Not his best performance in a movie (Remains of The Day is still his best work) but a close second (and yes Hannibal Lector is a movie icon and that was class too). It takes a subtlety and deft of hand to bring these many facets of one character into a believable performance.<br/><br/>5) Brad Pitt is consistently voted the most fancied bloke in the world and that is such a hindrance for an actor. But in this movie he does pull off one of his best performances. He both menacing and vulnerable at the same time. Believable child-like naivety, yet all knowledgeable. He's often underrated because of his looks but in this film he co-stars with the best and he holds his own well.<br/><br/>6) Jeffrey Tambor<br/><br/>7) Clare Forlani - must have been overwhelmed to have been cast opposite two of cinema's biggest icons but she does make the journey from cynical world weary doctor to smitten love struck woman believable. Her best scene is actually when she realises who Joe is and manages to convey a whole gamut of emotions without any dialogue.<br/><br/>8) Jake Weber (suitably slimy) and Marcia Gay Harden (suitably neurotic) – have small roles that add flavour, back story and substance to the main characters.<br/><br/>9) ""Death and Taxes"". A satisfying twist at the end explaining who Joe Black is, without revealing his true nature.<br/><br/>All in all, this film tell a story, in its own time. It has a great company of actors led by the best in the business. A story of a death without being morbid. A tale about appreciating things, loving your family, wanting the best for your children and not fearing death - its gonna happen anyway you cant change that but you can affect how you get there.<br/><br/>Yes it has flaws, what film doesn't. The final scene when Brad isn't death anymore - always makes me think why doesn't Susan say ""Hold on a minute, you are the bloke I fell for in the café but not the bloke I just kissed"". But you can do that in movies - you are after all watching light being transmitted at 24fps - you have already suspended your disbelief to be told a story - it isn't a documentary its a supernatural tale (Even and especially Shakespeare makes you believe in the fantastic). So I excuse that because the soundtrack is awesome while they are doing that scene.<br/><br/>Not everyone will relate to the lavish lifestyle portrayed in the film - helicopters, mansions, butlers, but that isn't the point! Of course if Death wants to experience the best in life, he's not gonna choose the life of a vagrant or a bedsit in Hackney. This film is not a social commentary.<br/><br/>It is sentimental, but then that's not such a bad thing. I take a lot of things from it about life, love and it doesn't hurt to be reminded that we are all mortal and to gain a perspective about your life as a whole.<br/><br/>All that is good about movies is contained in this film and I urge you take time out to watch this film with the most important people in your life, absorb the story, feel the emotions of the characters and most importantly buy the soundtrack!"

","Amidst all the clamor about ""star's"" personal lives, I must say, Brad Pitt is the very handsome (wish he could have been like) Robert Redford type person in this film (as he was in The River Runs Through It) that makes us girls drool. The music is worth a full box of Kleenex, alone. It is beautiful to look at. Anthony Hopkins continues to amaze. The relationship with the heart melting Bayou woman is heavenly. The ""twist the tables on the creep"" part is grand. Plus, you will never look at peanut butter the same way again. I remember when the film came out, all the buzz was that it was a disaster and that it was too long. Another problem with it was the, ""why do they feel the need to remake such a wonderful film?"", problem. What gets me, in my old age, is that nobody ever stops to remember and realize that ***BROADWAY*** is always reviving the best of the plays and musical comedies with all new casts and sometimes variations on a theme and people don't stir up such a ruckus. In fact, now they have a ""Tony"" category for them. I had better get the DVD. I always watch this when I see it's on. I guess owning the soundtrack is not enough."
"rbverhoef","8","0","0","28 March 2004"," A bit too long, but a fine movie anyway
","'Meet Joe Black' is a movie that could raise a lot of questions and a lesser movie probably would have. Here I accepted what the movie was telling me and I enjoyed the story, Anthony Hopkins and the charm of Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani.<br/><br/>A guy (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Claire Forlani) meet, flirt, probably fall in love and both go their own ways. The guy is hit by a car and Death takes his body to find out more about life. You hear me right, Death itself looks like Brad Pitt and he visits Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) to tell him he is going to die. Bill must show the life on earth to Death, who is introduced by Parrish as Joe Black, and in return Bill can live longer. Bill is a very rich guy, loved and respected by almost every other person in the movie, and it happens to be that Susan turns out to be his daughter. Of course Joe Black is not the guy she met that same morning, and although she notices strange things, they do fall in love. Death falls in love with a human being, but I didn't ask any questions.<br/><br/>There is another story. Bill, the rich dying man, is in the middle of a deal concerning his own company. He has to take Joe everywhere so people start getting suspicious and in this way the movie creates a real villain since Pitt can't be it. This story was not really necessary but it makes sure we know how to feel about every character.<br/><br/>Like I said, this movie has some things that make sure it works. The story is sweet with a good heart, probably stupid in a way, but we don't need to care. I didn't even want to. Hopkins is great, like almost always, and especially the way he speaks adds something to his perfect performance. Pitt shows why he is such a popular guy and may be it is true that his performance is a little overdone at times, he seems too aware of who he really represents, his charm pulls him through. Especially in the scenes together with Forlani, who is at least as charming, Pitt finds the right note for his character. The last thing I want to say is that the movie is a little too long. I wasn't bored once but I realized some scenes were not necessary, especially near the final moments. I was able to not be bothered by this, and I guess you can do the same."

Brad Pitt plays Death, he tells Anthony Hopkins he's going to die soon, and Hopkins doesn't ask about the afterlife or his dead wife or any of that.  It's not like the movie didn't have enough time to explore these aspects.  Despite the director's indulgence and Pitt's unbelievably portrayal of Death, Hopkins still pulls off some wonderful moments.  The direction, the screenplay, the lack of editing and Pitt's performance all warrant this a thumbs-down."

","A good movie. Not outstandingly excellent, but truly enjoyable. The cast choice was however above the average. Not one character was out of place. Sir Anthony (as William) was the highlight - again, of course, but Ms Forlani(as Susan), a first timer to me, played her role with passion. To me the other two outstanding choices for their roles were Jake Weber (as Drew - really very good) and Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince). Mr Pitt (as Joe Black) was acceptable. His character did however not give him space to get his head out of the clouds  -  and this floating-in-heaven look on his face got a bit irritating in the long run. But he did good of what was expected of him. The movie's length was not a known fact to me beforehand, but at no stage did it bother me to sit so long, but some of the long scenes were too long. The quality of the depth of what was said became a bit shallower. Life always has death blowing in its neck, and those who know of the time of door-knocking in advance,  has a little advantage to put quality into what is left before opening the door. Joe Black's visit portrays this very good - if the supernatural parts are taken with a pinch of salt."

There were moments of silence (w/o any background music) to try to engulf the audience, which can be fine, however I felt that it lasts much too long.  ""Meet Joe Black"" could have been trimmed to a 2.5 hr movie instead of a 3 hr one.  To its credit however, whenever things got slow (and you wanted to hit the Fast Forward button) a humorous moment followed as if to get the audience back into the movie.  There were quite a few lines that were memorable and worth quoting with as well as humorous moments.  But there were enough slow moments in the film that you walk away with at the end.

"mantone","6","0","0","13 December 1998"," Great Acting, Slow Pace
","Meet Joe Black.  Meet Brad Pitt, for 3 hours.  This is a movie that spends three hours on a screenplay that was written and rated for two.  It's a fine idea of a story.  Death (Pitt) comes to take a holiday with a dying millionaire (Hopkins) and just happens to fall in love with his daughter (Claire Forlani).  Meanwhile,a two-faced, untrustworthy man, who happens to be engaged to Forlani, attempts to steal the family business from Hopkins. Death, however, has come to save the day for Hopkins, only long enough so that he can bring him with him to the great beyond.  It's a great plot with an excellent cast.  Yet, this movie fails to deliver the goods.<br/><br/>The main problem that this film has is that they must have fired the editor before they took the final copy to edit.  This movie is three hours long. And it's a long three hours.  As a result, it flows along like a turtle who is in a hurry to get to the end of a mile long stretch.  Some scenes are painfully long.  I kept waiting for something to happen that would move it along, but it never came.  The climax of this film (you know, the part where all of the movie's problems get solved) lasts well over an hour.  I kept waiting for it to end, but it kept on going.<br/><br/>Many women that I've discussed this movie with think that it's the greatest movie they've ever seen.  Why?  Simple...Brad Pitt.  I keep thinking that if they hadn't cast Brad Pitt in the lead, this movie would have been a complete failure.  I like Brad Pitt, and I find that he has great acting skills and an ability to captivate his audience by his charm and good looks. His presence somehow makes this movie tolerable.<br/><br/>The guys in the audience will find newcomer Claire Forlani equally attractive.  She offers a stunning screen presence and surprisingly good acting skills.<br/><br/>Hopkins, of course, is a genius of an actor.  He brings credibility to this movie.  Who else could play a millionaire with such style and finesse in such an honorable way.  Once again, he provides a great performance.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 6 for the following reasons.  High marks for the exceptional acting from Hopkins, Pitt, and Forlani; and a clever idea of a script.  Low marks for the slowness of its pace.  All in all, it's a better than average film that is dragged down by it's length and pace."

"jen-47","10","0","0","3 December 1998"," Best Film of 1998
","JauntyJen@aol.com Ronkonkoma, NY<br/><br/>I thought Meet Joe Black was a sweet, funny, touching, and thought provoking film.  I already saw it twice and plan to go back a third time.  For this movie to work, the viewer has to have an open mind about two things:   1. To accept the absurd notion that Death is a conscious being who experiences a sudden curiosity to experience life as mortal human beings know it.  2.  To be forgiving of certain plot elements which are never fully explained.  A lot is left to the viewers interpretation.  I thought all the performances in this film were noteworthy, especially Anthony Hopkins as Bill Parrish. Here is a man who not only has to deal with the knowledge of his impending demise, but has to spend his last days accompanied by Death, in the heavenly human form of Brad Pitt.  (who has never looked better).  Death, introduced as ""Joe Black""  follows Parrish around as he tries to tries to tie up loose ends in his business (which Parrish considers his legacy), and tries to make the most of his time left on earth with his family.  Brad Pitt as he plays the mysterious Joe Black is both innocent and awkward, charismatic and seductive, and  frighteningly omnipotent.  In his arrangement to give Parrish a limited reprieve while he ""sees the world"", he holds all the cards, and Bill Parrish is increasingly frustrated in his realization that he doesn't have the bargaining power which served him so well in former business dealings.  The character Joe Black also develops a romantic interest in Parrish's younger daughter Susan (played by the misty-eyed Claire Forlani).  As for the concept of Death falling in love or even having any human emotions, it can be explained that love and other human emotions are at least partly influenced by bio-chemical processes.  It stands to reason that a being occupying a human body would be subject to these hormonal and chemical reactions to outside triggers (such as the sight or smell of a potentially compatible mate), which cause the human brain to experience feelings of lust, desire, infatuation and ultimately love. It is even easier to understand, since we already know the previous human occupant of Joe Black's body was also attracted to Susan, who had a brief but flirtatious encounter with him in a coffee shop.  By the end of the movie, even the supporting characters such as the fawning older daughter, her seemingly inept but good hearted husband, and Bill Parrish's trusted business partner, are fleshed out.  Each has at least one emotional or pivotal scene which brings their motivations to light.  I did not think this movie was too long, in fact I hardly noticed it was 3 hours.  I cannot think of one scene which could be cut without compromising the movie.  The scenes were paced to give the viewer time to imagine what the characters might have been thinking at that moment.  The actors did an admirable job of conveying the various emotions through their facial expressions and limited dialogue. The cinematography and lighting were also extremely relaxing and pleasing to the eye.  All in all, I would recommend this film to anyone who believes the key to happiness is keeping close family ties, living life to its fullest without compromising moral and ethical principles, and settling for nothing less than true love."

","Why do people still to go to the cinema instead of enjoying the comfort, cheapness and convenience of their own TVs, VCRs, DVDs, cable or satellite movie channels? The local multiplex certainly offers the latest (but not greatest) features, the big screen, the ""night out"" achievement, and a certain social comarderie with the huddled masses in the darkened theatre. However, for this movie it is the very masses themselves that detract from any enjoyment of the film. In any given theatre, on any given evening the film will be playing to a teenage female majority, whose primary interest in the film in the presence (not ability) of Mr Pitt. Anyone considering this movie who is either male or over the age of 18 should wait until it appears at their local video store and save themselves the squirms, whispers and giggles of the attending sycophants.

No direction, no focus, no development, no goals.Maybe I'm missing the attraction of watching a guy like Pitt fumble around embarrassingly and pretend like he's experiencing everything for the first time; as I said, I'm not a woman. But for me, Brad Pitt was absolute dead weight in this film, which makes for a bit of a sticky situation as he's one of the leads. The writing, on the other hand, was even worse. Hackneyed, trite, generic, cliched, tired; at times frankly insulting. Hopkins managed to save much of the script from itself (at least his bits), but these guys (Osborn and Reno) have little or no grasp of decent dialogue. Claire Forlani is certainly beautiful, but her facial expressions became tiresome fast, bordering on gimmicky before the film was half over (why CAN'T she make eye contact even once in awhile? She was like the lead singer of ""the Bangles""). Hopkins is marvelous, however; he truly is one of the finest performers of this or any other generation. I would rank this among the most workmanlike performances from him I've seen; given the atrocious script he had to work with. For me the bright spot of the film (outside of the pure joy of watching Anthony Hopkins perform) was Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor. They were terrific. Harden's desperate need for her father's love and attention; Tambor's bumbling naivety and love for his wife; and Hopkins' endearing, dignified love for his daughters (Hopkins truly is, as Harden says, ""a wonderful father"") are the things I'll take away from this film, almost in and of themselves enough to save the film for me. But not quite. Maybe I just don't get it."

","This was a quick movie for three hours.  That is, it kept my interest throughout.

Even when in the background he had presence.  When in the foreground he stole the scene. Quince's interaction with Joe, in the bar, was the icing on the cake for me. Quince's internal battle with his utter despair is as convincing a job of acting as I have seen in so many movies, and Marcia Gay is a close second for her performance.

","If you are looking for a fast paced movie Meet Joe Black is not for you.  However, if you are looking for a good movie that is humorous and touching even though it deals realistically (even in farcial way) with the extremely serious subject of Death then this is the movie for you.  The movie takes its time and develops all the character well.  The dialogue is excellent and the supporting cast is very good, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Hopkins are great.  Mr. Pitt who plays Joe Black/Death is the only actor I can think of who have played this part.  He is an excellent actor who plays the part of an attractive, both socially and physically with his boy next good looks, Death (Joe Black).  He is actually likeable in his innocence.  I can hardly say enough about him.  Mr. Hopkins who is certainly one of the best actors of 20th Century was excellent as well. The chemistry between the two is great, and I suspect that they like and respect each other off the set.  The movie is about three hours long but I did not notice until after.  If you like well written, well acted, good dialogue, and great characters then you will enjoy Meet Joe Black.  I would give this movie three plus stars and once again thank Mr. Pitt for an excellent performance."

"jengod","Null","0","0","7 November 1998"," Touching, well-made and thoughtful.
","The essential and unnerving lesson in Meet Joe Black is the inevitability of death. From nearly the first scene we are made aware that Anthony Hopkins' Bill Parrish will die. When the Reaper, in the form of, yes, Brad Pitt, comes on the scene, we are told again and again. Throughout the movie there is the thought, hey, this is a movie, he won't die. But he does. That's not a spoiler. It's a part of life, and the life cycle, that this movie treats with great respect and consideration. In short, this film is about the persona of Death, who comes to earth on a ""holiday"" with the intention of learning about the modern world and the people who inhabit it. He chooses for his guide, Bill Parrish, a whole-souled, worldly media magnate with two loving daughters. Marcia Gay Harden's character apparently plans parties for a living. Susan, played by Claire Forlani, is a doctor. Now, if you have to go, you could have worse escorts than Brad Pitt. He's amazing. We all think he's cute, when he's not doing weird things to his hair, but in parts of this film, the strange innocence of a character who does not really know the world, combined with that face, is almost too much. Despite the fact that death brings thoughts of hideous decay and putrefaction, in this film, death wears a face from heaven. It softens the blow for Bill Parrish and beyond that, it brings some kind of quality of luminescence to a movie that could be so shadowed. Inevitably, there is a love story and this one effectively convinces us that it is one of those timeless true loves. In part, it can't be anything else - Death probably doesn't have flings. Forlani, the girl, is wonderfully fragile and human, and more importantly she has a wonderful truthfulness about her. She's not just an actress acting, but a real person in the midst of experiences that are almost incomprehensible. The film has the some of that icky Hollywood quality where every scene, every room, every restaurant are perfect, shiny and bright, slaved over by some set designer. This world of the incredibly rich that grates a bit. The final scenes are set at a party that is unfortunately reminiscent of the party scenes in the recent Harrison Ford Sabrina. It's a world of fantasy that doesn't play in real life. When it's blown up one hundred times on screen it's far too much to take. And it is the last scenes, the last five minutes of the film, that are Meet Joe Black's only failing. One senses the influence of test audiences and focus groups. Sometimes people don't know what's good for them. In this case, what's supposed to be a kind of happy ending compromises the integrity of the rest of the film. The attempt at feel-good is not at all comforting and it demeans the love between the entity, the man perhaps, that is Death and his girl, a lovely lady doctor from New York."

","This is such a beautifully made film, the best film of the year, so far. Brad Pitt gives his best performance since ""12 Monkeys.""  Anthony Hopkins gives, (surprise surprise), another excellent performance.  If the academy doesn't consider him for another Oscar, I lose all faith in them.  Claire Forlani, a very beautiful woman with a very exotic name, gives an impressive performance.  She has matured so much since I first saw her in ""Mallrats."" My motto is that sometimes less is more.  That might seem like an oxymoron when it comes to this film's time length.  What I mean is, that the longing looks between Brad and Claire said so much more than actual dialogue.  I found myself getting caught up in their emotions, or perhaps there were things going on in my mind at the time.  In any effect, the scenery is beautiful throughout.  Each scene is lit perfectly and made it appear much more elegant.  The love scene between Brad and Claire was very sensual.  I would compare this film to Martin Brest's other great achievement, ""Scent Of A Woman.""  The performances, the scenery, the cinematography, the score and the dialogue has made this the year's best film and one of the greatest romances of all time."

","""Meet Joe Black"" is a deliberative and contemplative story about discovering love for the first time, about passion and fire, and bursting anger.  The movie's slow pacing makes the movie's calculating business intrigue storyline even more powerful and gripping while the first half of the movie's ironic humor captures the heart of romance.  This is a great movie that gives depth to supporting characters especially the sister and the business associate (scenes which remind of ""It's A Wonderful Life"").  There is a remarkable love scene that glows with passion and emotional power without graphic sex.  And Anthony Hopkins closes in on death with a vengeance.  Brad Pitt plays a cool character that has an undercurrent of inbred superiority and hard, icy edge underneath his bewildered exterior.

","--minor Spoilers below--<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black is 20 minutes too long and deserved a more courageous ending.  But, it still is a great picture!   The setting of the movie is:<br/><br/>1st Big Moment (min 01): The movie starts and we meet Death right away, although just as an internal voice.  But it's all we need.  It's the perfect way for Death to appear -as our inner voice.  After all, don't we all have this little voice telling us stuff all day long?  What if one day that pre-existent voice had a different tone, a tone we haven't heard before? What would we do?   How could we share that with anybody? It is such a personal matter, such an inner experience.  However, if you have ever been close with someone with a terminal illness you know this is exactly what happens to them.<br/><br/>And now, in the movie, the supernatural presence of Death has become legit, we let suspension of disbelief take over for now, unless the movie gets ridiculous -fortunately, it doesn't.  And the relationship between the two main characters in the movie begins as interestingly as it can be.  Next we are given the atmosphere.  An opulent setting, luxurious<br/><br/>toys, refined manners (a classical ""aspirational background"") and just as important: an emotional setting (strong family connections and a specially close relationship between the father and his younger daughter).  Plus, the apparent emotional antagonist of Death is also presented (Death can't have a physical antagonist) as the inadequate love interest of Death's future romantic interest.  Of course, the true emotional antagonist of Death is much more powerful and interesting: it's his own chosen victim.<br/><br/>2nd Big Moment (min 11):  ""Lightning strikes.""  If Iraq had half the chemistry displayed between Brad Pitt and the breathtaking Claire Forlani in that coffee shop sequence we would be in big trouble. Now, the moment we meet Brad Pitt we realize we are not seeing Death yet, it can't be, he's too captivatingly earthy (male magnetism galore). The deliciously coy Claire has little to say but her body language tells us all we need to know.<br/><br/>It is a classic moment we have seen in movies and experienced in real life many times and yet it never losses its magic: boy and girl meet and their eyes lock as the rest of the world vanishes around them. Usually, that instant recognition of mutual attraction is later disguised in furtive looks, nervous laughs, and lots of subtext talk.  Like in this sequence, when they appear to be talking about Brad's eventual need of a doctor and Brad says ""then you could be it"" and she says ""I could be her,"" and then they both repeat what they just said, only this time it is evident they are not talking about medicine.<br/><br/>3rd Big Moment (min 21): it's the stuff mythology is made off. Both characters, continue to deny to themselves what is happening, refuse to verbalize what is so obvious to their hearts and slowly walk away from one another, not even knowing each other's names.  There are moments of hesitation in which their emotional needs seem ready to overcome the risk of losing face and yet ego prevails and they keep walking away. Claire escapes toward the secure distractions of her career, Brad literally crashes into the hands of Death.<br/><br/>The audience is in shock as just moments ago they were empathizing watching two very likeable characters drift apart before their eyes, perhaps reliving their own acts of timidity and lost opportunities, to the chords of the magnificent music of Thomas Newman in the background. This is the very kind of ritualistic experience for the audience that Jung had in mind with his ""participation mystique.""  In a fraction of a second we go from a metaphorical romantic agony to a real, fleshy, bloody agony... well, that IS life, and that is exactly what a movie about Death is all about, life.<br/><br/>And this is the set-up that takes us to Plot Point-I when Death meets his chosen victim face to face (min 30).<br/><br/>Cizin"

","Despite its long running time (3 hours), Meet Joe Black manages to keep the audience enthralled with its captivating characters, and emotional story. Basically this movie is about ""Death"" learning about life.  ""Death"" takes the form of a human in order to learn about life and what are its qualities if any. In doing so, he falls in love with the daughter of the man he's supposed to bring to death.  He must now decide whether to take the woman he loves into death, or leave her on earth to experience the goodness of life he's learned about.<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black is a movie loaded with romance and drama.  The former part including scenes with Brad Pitt and Clair Forlani flirting with each other, or making love.  There is a lot of chemistry between the two, and it just brings a smile to your face when they interact with each other.  Anthony Hopkins brings a lot of drama to this movie, by outstandingly playing the part of a loving father with two daughters who must bear the weight of his company on his back.  This movie is well acted, and shouldn't be missed. You'll leave the theater, knowing how precious life is and that love can even conquer ""Death""."

It's almost ridiculous how balanced everything in the scene is. Overall, Meet Joe Black has good acting, a bad storyline, but great manipulation of sound.

Cliches and easy shortcuts are smartly avoided. Lot of finesse. Each actor is really brilliant and created true characters in such a way that you never think of their previous roles.

Hopkins and Jake Weber (Drew) run away with the plot, Weber ranks next to Billy Zane (Cal from _Titanic_) as Hollywood's next great bad guy.

","I am amazed at the amount of negative criticism this movie has received. By far, one of the best pictures I have seen this year, and I would go as far as to place it in my top 10 of all time.  Comprised entirely all the elements I find essential to a great movie, I would be hard pressed to find anything bad to say about it. Brad Pitt serves up one of his finest performances in his role as Death. Now some critics say he came across as wooden and unemotional, and as rumor has it Brad has said this himself, but I would argue to the point that he is after all, Death.  How lively do you want him?  And judging from the sighs from the girls around me whenever Brad was on screen, Death never looked so good. Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as usual.  Playing the part of Bill Parrish, a wealthy communications mogul who is about to meet his maker, his performance is first rate.  I have no trouble believing he is the character he portrays as is always the case.  I only need to remember back when I thought he WAS Hannibel Lector to remind me of how gifted and versatile he is. Claire Forlani gives her best performance to date as the youngest of two daughters of Bill Parrish.  She also plays love interest for Death in his time on earth, and again she is fits the bill perfectly. The supporting cast as a whole was on par with the stars of this film. The minor sub plots in this movie in which they are involved are just as good as movie in whole. Lastly, the soundtrack is genius, and I have come to expect nothing less from Thomas Newman. In closing Brad Pitt is NOT just a pretty face, so give him his due. Anthony Hopkins turns in another top rate perfomance. Claire Forlani is as talented an actress is she is beautiful and this movie can not be missed.<br/><br/>PS-I cried at this movie and if you didn't you're as heartless as the critics who hated it.<br/><br/>PSS-Legends Of The Fall is also in my top 10, so I can only hope that Brad and Anthony do another movie, because they are great together."
"ricoblast","8","0","0","7 February 2002"," Now multiply that by infinity and take it to the depth of forever
","So much has been said about the length of this film and in my opinion without real need. The film works well being three hours long and gives a true sense of time in relation to the film itself. The plot isn't important, but this seems to have been lost within the plot driven minds of many. Characterisation is always the most vital key in films such as this. And this abounds. The performance of Anthony Hopkins is good but not awe inspiring but then again it doesn't need to be.It isn't his film. But he does portray the business mogul with a heart well and feels genuine. I bet most would like to wake up one morning and realise they 'want nothing more'. His relationship with his daughters is interesting as it shows that it is enough to know that you are loved. Clire Forlani is breathtaking. Not perhaps her acting at all points (esp. when she utters ""I feel like we're taking off"") but her look, timing and body language fits the role perfectly. But who is important is Brad Pitt. I was never a Pitt fan but gradually was turned with his roles in Twelve Monkeys and the Devil's Own (didn't think much to se7en) yet this was the first point I realised the guy can really act! Other comments have described him as 'dull' or 'rigid' but they are missing the point. The character in the coffee shop is engaging and perhaps the one everybody would have liked to see throughout but Death is where he comes alive!The best way to describe his portrayl would be as a cross between a blind person who has just gained their sight and is intriged and enchanted by everything around them and the look of interested bewilderment which young children have when seeing, say, the circus for the first time. This seems to fit beautifully into the film, ad feels right. The character is endeering through a childlike innocence yet partnered well with a hidden undercurrent of darkness.Pitt has the ability to command the scene over the seemingly more powerful Hopkins.Some have said that Forlani wouldn't fall for the 'stony Pitt' but stony isn't the right expression. He is repressed (not in a bad way) and it is this which makes him mysterious and ultimately captivating as an individual. He hides such yet is completey open,sometimes embrassingly so as he requsts peanut butter instead of a gourmet meal.The inner child rules all. Brad Pitt leapt in my estimation and I now look forward to seeing him on the screen.<br/><br/>If all this wasn't enough, the cinematography is unbelievable. The framing and spacing combined with the film's richness of apearance is wonderful. The ending, as he stands on the bridge, is one of the most beautiful scenes in cinema I can remember. The score also contributes immensly. It is soulful yet maintains the underlying hint of darkness.The orchestal arrangemnet of 'What a wonderful world' should be cheesy and over the top but somehow it works.<br/><br/>My only complaint in an otherwise beautiful film is the ending. I almost wish that Hollywood didn't exist or the film was british so that we wouldn't have to have the token 'happy Hollywood' ending. Though this is a minor point. Watch this film for a number of reasons. 1.Brad Pitt and 2. this is how a film should look!!"

","""Meet Joe Black,"" is one of those movies whose plot and cinematic beauty will keep you watching, even for three hours.

In the process he discovers love with Susan Parrish, played by Clair Forlani. Susan happens to be the daughter of rich tycoon William Parrish, played by Anthony Hopkins. Death/Joe Black is giving Parrish a few extra days on earth while he explores life and all things human. The cimematography is exquisite, the sound track memorable and haunting, especially the melody the comes up each time Joe and Susan are alone together. The love scene between Susan and Joe is stylishly sensual; the fireworks scene outdoes Hitchcock's from ""To Catch A Thief.""

There are many good things in this film, including poignant performances by Hopkins, Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor, and suitable ones by Pitt and Claire Forlani, and a few touching scenes. However, what is good about the movie is dragged out over three lugubrious hours, with many scenes that seem to take for-ev-er. Had director Brest not allowed his ego to overrun the project and had he kept the best stuff in while trimming the fat, this could have been an extremely effective 120-minute entertainment.

(Possible spoiler ahead) However, the ending (""you'll always have the guy in the coffeeshop"") has been done before in Warren Beatty's ""Heaven Can Wait"" (""he might even be a Quarterback"") which itself was a remake of ""Here Comes Mister Jordan"" from the '40's. And nothing annoys me more than when Hollywood composers rip off a classical composition and pass it off as their own - witness the music in the first few minutes which is extraordinarily similar to Arvo Paert's ""Fratres"" (ditto the music in ""Patriot Games"" which is ""taken"" from Shostakovich)."

","This movie had a promising premise and a great cast.  Unfortunately it was very slow-moving and an effort to watch.  Some scenes were very entertaining, but the story could have been told in almost half the time. That would have also contributed to it being a more enjoyable film. <br/><br/>
I was disappointed by Martin Brest's first effort since Scent Of A Woman, one of my favourite films.  It had none of that movie's fun, emotion or humanity.  Pitt and Hopkins, as always, delivered very fine performances and Jeffrey Tambor impressively showed his serious side.  <br/><br/>If you have the time, it's worth a look, but it's no Scent Of A Woman."

","Death wants to check out life, so he borrows Brad Pitt's body and crashes at the pad of a multi-millionaire (Anthony Hopkins),  who just happens to be a nice guy with a beautiful daughter about to marry a snake. If death always made such good choices, only the bad would die young. The death character is inconsistent.  At times, he appears omniscient. He seems to know every sin some of the characters ever committed and he's familar with the IRS (is there a connection here?).  But he has to be told what peanut butter is and has to be shown how to eat!<br/><br/>Like Brest's ""Scent of a Woman"", this film is too long but satisfying in the way good characters triumph over bad.  And, as death films go, it's much better than ""What Dreams May Come"". In fact, it even has a more dramatic and shattering car accident.My score 7/10."

","To be honest i went looking for flaws in this film as i couldn't imagine another Brad Pitt/Anthony Hopkins pairing could pull off Legends of Fall. Duly however, i was wrong and their chemistry is better than ever and you can see the respect in Pitt's eyes when he works with Hopkins. Saying that, i personally feel Pitt carried this movie considerably and marks with Seven as one of his more powerful and subtle performances. ( Now you can't say that last sentence often with Brad Pitt can you ? !! )<br/><br/>****** MILD SPOILERS AHEAD *****<br/><br/>Anyhows, the story is one of Hopkins' billionaire character having the opportunity to live out his last days as Brad Pitt assumes the GrimReaper and challenges Hopkins to question his entire life choices and its consequences. This includes the future of his ER doctor daughter (Claire Forlani----who btw is soo000 cute and vulnerable that any testosterone-packed individual will instantly fall in love with her upon sight) and Hopkins' business. We see throughout the movie and fantastic love-hate repartee between Hopkins and Pitt that culminates with such a touching finale that ties up the loose ends.Martin Brest doesn't just tie up loose ends mind you,....the man does it with with A1 cinematic aplomb.<br/><br/>**** END OF MILD SPOILERS ****<br/><br/>Although the film is 3 hrs long, honestly i didn't feel it. Partly because i didn't know it was GOING to be 3 hrs long. So if you read my last comment, just chill and let the story guide you ..you will be duly surprised and not think any $$$ of the budget was mis-spent. Jeffrey Tambor doe a decent Hank and fits in well to steal various comic scenes as Hopkins' son-in-law but make no mistake it's Brad Pitt's & Anthony Hopkins driving vehicle.But the moral, with the Devil dictating someone's life with educated and compassionate choices, prove a fantastic watch. Full marks to Martin Brest. If he can make Midnight Run a modern day classic, he made Meet Joe Back human."

","A beautiful film, at times.  Director Martin Brest hit his stride with ""Scent of a Woman,"" and that style is evidenced here-- the scene when the young Ms. Parrish meets the Man in the Coffee shop, at the beginning, is a truly beautiful scene, and it is moments like this that the director, and the film, thrive upon.<br/><br/>The moment immediately after it, coupled with the ending of the film, simply do not gel.  Without giving the ending away, there was simply no thought put into it.  Every individual moment in the film works superbly on its own terms, but as a whole, the film fails.  This can only be the fault of *SEVEN* credited screenwriters, four people trying to update a screenplay written by two people, working from a play written by a single man. Hollywood overkill in its purest form.<br/><br/>This film was great, almost.  One more rewrite and it could have been there, it's a pity this version got made.  It's like a really beautiful sports car, excellent interior, exterior, sound system, but it's missing a radio.

If you are young and seeking sex and action, you'll probably find this film boring, like some of the comments below indicate. If you have faced death in your own life, if you have cried over lost love and if you have also cried at having true love, then you will probably find Meet Joe Black a wonderfully fulfilling experience. You will see comments below that support this. The slow pace was perfect for us, perfect for dealing with a benevolent Mr. Death, but other comments found it way too slow. Quite a disparity here!<br/><br/>The top three actors (Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani) give Oscar-level performances. Claire Forlani delivers some of the best love scenes I have ever seen. Her facial expressions convey far more than pages of the usual Hollywood script. The music, editing and casting were faultless.

If you watch the closing scene carefully, you will note that although the sky is filled with brilliant light from the multitude of bursting rockets, the dark figures of of Pitt and Hopkins who are walking up the stone steps of the garden are not illuminated by flashes of colour from the sky.

Anthony Hopkins was brilliant as usual. The supporting cast was wonderful  and VERY believable.If the movie has a downside, I would have cast the female lead differently ...but that is just me.  Also, I believe I detected a hint of Irish accent in Brad ....but here again it may be just wishful thinking.  If ye get a chance, please go see this one ...... I doubt that ye will regret it!"

","This film was an enigma. I applaud any director willing to make a movie with long, meandering scenes that explore characters more deeply than the average skin-deep Hollywood flick. At the same time, long and meandering coupled with boring is a bit too much to stomach. There has to be some reasonable, believable motivation, and none of these characters had it (except for the money-loving Drew). The spiritual connection between Pitt's Death and the other characters never went beyond his being courteous and properly enunciating their first names. Claire Forlani is a wonderful girl to look at, but I hate being confronted with those ""only in Hollywood is she a [doctor rocket scientist primate researcher]"" characters.<br/><br/>I like watching people muse about life and death, and it's great to see writers tackling interesting approaches to the subject. Some people will undoubtedly connect to this film. I didn't. This gets the sore-butt award of the week."

","Meet Joe Black is just one of those movies that you see a preview for and you feel a deep emotion from it, but then you see the whole movie and wonder where all the emotion went.<br/><br/>Let me just say that Anthony Hopkins is by far the most talented actor on the face of this earth, and he did a great job with his role.  Brad Pitt did the job he needed to do.  People may think the character was stiff, but that was his role.  He was death.  Was it just me or does Claire Forlani have a hard time seeing.  She is always squinting throughout the film.  I was waiting for her to say,""I love you Joe but where are you at exactly"".  All the supporting roles were sufficient.<br/><br/>What was wrong with Meet Joe Black, was that you cannot feal any sadness for Brad Pitt a.k.a Death.  He is not human so how can you relate to him.  By the end of that loooooooonnnnnnnnnngggggg birthday scene I could care less about the human characters also.<br/><br/>The movie was acted well, the direction sucked(slow and tedious even when it wasn't supposed to be), great script, and somewhat good idea.

","My first thought, after seeing about half this film, was that it had to be this particular studio & director's answer to/version of the Nicholas Cage/Meg Ryan '98 film ""City of Angels.""  After all is said and done, isn't it just the Angel of Death coming to Earth, falling for a female mortal, and being disappointed in the end (as Death in this case, not as a human mortal male)?  After about 20+ viewings this past week, this is what stays with me most, at any rate.<br/><br/>For those who totally panned this film, stop and rethink this POV: isn't this done *much* more ""tongue-in-cheek"" than ""City of Angels"" was?  ""City"" seemed to take itself much too seriously, and it left me highly p****d off at Meg Ryan's character for being so foolhardy. ""Joe"" leaves me smirking, if not LOL, which BP constantly seems to be on the verge of doing due to some of the downright puerile lines he was given. Then again, if *I* were Pitt, I'd laugh my a**e off all the way to the bank, too.  As for Sir Anthony Hopkins:  poor man fared much better with ""Silence of the Lambs"" as Hannibal the Cannibal, didn't he?  He seemed almost too restrained to me at most points, when he should have been raging against his all-too-soon-to-be fate (""I shall *not* go gently into this good night,"" and so on.). Several times I during the film, I wish to see the *originally* filmed version, instead of this editor's idea of something we should *pay* to see. I seriously doubt a ""director's cut"" will ever be available, but if so, I'd like to see it.  Still, with all its flaws, and all the dumb lines and improbable situations there is something about this that's like Black's peanut butter (or better yet, a Lay's potato chip):  I just can't put it aside.  I find something new to love about it every time. P.S. Thought:  I wonder who told the costume designer what Pitt's clothing sizes were *supposed* to be for this film?  Whoever it was didn't do the job at *all* well, speaking as a clothier.  JMNSHLO."

","I have to admit that I didn't see this movie when it hit theatres primarily because the promos just gave no indication what it was about [that and I've never really cared for Brad Pitt].  However, despite problems with sound levels [which REALLY need to be worked out, everything being too soft, then the music cutting in and slamming you into the wall opposite the tv] the movie was a surprise.  I really liked it, and Brad Pitt [Joe Black]  does a fine job as Death, a being who has always been so locked into its job it has never had a vacation and calling upon Anthony Hopkins [William Parrish] to act as ""mentor"" in the world of mortality. Its three hour length may have been one thing that turned people off in the U.S.  I don't recall ticket sales being that high for this movie.  But the script needs those three hours to allow the audience a plausible reason to LIKE Joe Black, which is necessary for the story to work.  A movie well worth renting for any evening."
"MJDoc12","9","0","0","14 November 1998"," A different take on life & love
","Meet Joe Black is certainly an original film and idea.  Death takes a vacation to see what life is all about, and he ends up falling in love.  Sir Anthony Hopkins gives a wonderful performance (as usual) as Bill Parish, the man that Death decides he wants as his guide on Earth, before he takes him. Brad Pitt is a pleasant surprise as Death/Joe Black.  A scene in which he tries peanut butter for the first time, he gives off the impression that he truly is having it for the first time.  The film's characters tend to say some overly-romantic things that make you wonder if the writers were trying too hard to make sure the audience can see the kind of ""head over heels"" love they are portraying.  Also, there are a few over dramatic moments in which the score is simply blasting overture in order to create a special dramatic moment, that just seems to be pushing it too hard.  At just about 3 hours, Meet Joe Black does feel a little long, but you don't seem to feel it until you reach the end.  All in all, the film lets you think about how much time you really have and whether or not you can live your life to the fullest in the time that you are here on Earth.  The question that you ask yourself at the end as you leave the theatre is, ""Has someone thanked me for loving them, and have I thanked someone for being loved?"""

","I had quite low expectations before going in to see this movie, having heard so much bad press about it around the time of its release. How wrong I was, and what a great surprise it turned out to be. If, like me, you go in without any strong peconceptions of what it might/should be about then I think you'll love it. Claire Forlani is stunning, as is the chemistry between her and Brad Pitt. Hopkins gives what is surely one of his career-best performances and the film wanders along its superbly constructed narrative with class and wit. It is not, at 3 hours, overly long, any less and its conclusion would have been premature. Overall 'Meet Joe Black' is an extremely watchable piece of film-making without pretensions to be anything else other than an enjoyable story of love and yes, you guessed it, Death. Also, Look out for one of the most startling stunt scenes to hit the screens in recent times! Blink and you'll miss it."
"ChitlinF","7","0","0","31 May 1999"," Mixed, but quite seductive, bag
","Meet Joe Black is in many ways a wonderful movie. It is grandly, shamelessly romantic in a way few movies these days dare to be, and quite successful on that level. Brad Pitt is certainly one of our best contemporary leading romantic men, and the lovely Claire Forlani is utterly compelling, both as love interest, and as daughter to the film's real star, the incomparable Anthony Hopkins.<br/><br/>In an age where we've come to expect virtuosic acting to club us over the head, a al Nicholson, DeNiro, Pacino, and Streep, Hopkins is a subtle master without peer. His greatest praise was for Silence of the Lambs, but his greatest role was in Remains of the Day, in which he expressed an astonishing depth of pain, solitude, and character with very few words or even over gestures and expressions. In Meet Joe Black, Hopkins gives us another magnificently etched, subtly towering performance. The theme is old and timeless: a man coming to terms with his life and imminent death. Hopkins makes it more than compelling.<br/><br/>In tandem, both he and Forlani, and he and Marcia Gay Harden (as his less-favored daughter) create remarkably believable and beautiful father-daughter relationships. I think it is in these areas that the film is most successful (I speak as the father of two daughters myself).<br/><br/>The film is a bit too long, and at times the writing betrays itself with a lack of subtlety. Also, while Pitt is marvelous in the Lead Romantic Male part of his role, he is not a particularly menacing Death. At times, particularly in scenes next to the Towering Hopkins, he seems positively puny.<br/><br/>But let yourself get swept away by this film, forgive it's couple of flaws, and you'll be enormously entertained."

","I liked the idea, but I think they could have cut certain scenes down considerably, saved time, and still have made this film impactful.  For instance didn't the scene in the study when Bill first sees Joe kind of drag on just a little too long?  Maybe I'm a little impatient, but I kept thinking, ""Okay okay, we get it! Let's move it along!""  In fact this holds true for many scenes, including that first family dinner scene with Joe. They could have wrapped up this movie in a nice, tidy 2 hours without losing any of the emotional qualities.  As far as the ending, didn't Brad Pitt seem like he was having a few problems believing his own lines.  I thought I saw him struggling to maintain a straight face while saying something to the effect of, ""Well, I don't really know what happened after the coffee shop, but hey!  Looks like you got a nifty little party going on...""  Me?  I guess I'd be just a tad more disoriented and just a smidgen more incredulous as to how one minute I'm in a coffee shop with the woman of my dreams, and then suddenly I'm standing with her at a groovy soiree dressed in a tux.  But hey, that's me. I guess I'm funny that way.  Brad just seems to go with the flow on that one.  And how about Susan.  She seems to accept the death thing pretty well.  I mean her father disappears over a hill with some guy she falls in love with who just happens to be death, right?  Then the guy comes back alone, and all she can say is, ""I wish you could have known my father. C'mon, lets party."" And off they go hand in hand.  I really did like this film, however.  There is an undeniable emotional quality, especially during the scene with Bill and Susan near the end.  A little long, however. Ridiculous in certain parts."

","Definitely not as moving as the original ""Death Takes A Holiday"" (rather disturbingly left off the credits as the source material) with the inimitable Frederick March, nonetheless Meet Joe Black has its moments. It's too long, yes, and filled with pregnant pauses that don't always deliver brilliant offspring. But there are aspects of this film that provide the kinds of goods that cinema has always provided since the days of Valentino and Pickford: Beautiful people to look at. Claire Forlani is very appealing, and Brad Pitt is the best looking man in the movies today. Not enough?<br/><br/>OK. Anthony Hopkins is fine as the powerful media magnate who is bound for Jordan's banks. Without him this film could have been a chore.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's character in the beginning of the film is very winning, but he disappears when Death takes him over. The Death character is less appealing and Pitt struggles with it, not always successfully. His best moments are the scenes with a dying Jamaican woman in a hospital. There his liveliness and intensity are evident. Of course, being Death, how lively can he really be?<br/><br/>And it's too long. Did I mention that?<br/><br/>The sub-plot about the boardroom takeover is somewhat labored and feels inorganic to the rest of the story.

This movie certainly had those qualities to make you think a bit deeper about how we take each day for granted and yet we really don't have the opportunity that William Parish did.

"WeslyM","9","0","0","4 May 1999"," When movies are at their best...
","Movies are at their best when actors are allowed to do what they do: act. Director Martin Brest isn't afraid to allow his principals (Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt, and Clare Forlani) to take their time making their characters real for us.  And these characters are real--they not only live, they also breathe on the screen.  In fact, Brest luxuriates in the story-telling process and allows us to revel in the glorious results.  This is an exquisitely emotional film, delicate and beautiful, brutal and incisive. Although some reviews have criticized its length (approaching three hours) and pacing, the truth is that virtually every scene is vital.  In fact, some sequences seem to move with somewhat less smoothness and subtlety than others, suggesting that, even at its current length, the film has been extensively edited for time.  Hopkins is ferociously good; Pitt is enigmatic and engaging; Forlani is breathtaking, luminous, a revelation of deep and naked emotion.  Inspired by ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (1934), ""Meet Joe Black"" is less concerned with what happens in the next life than with how to live fully and with integrity in this one."

If you can get past the tinny/robot-like movements of Brad Pitt when we first meet Mr. Black, and those horrible pregnant pauses during dialogues, the rest of the flick is smooth sailing.

","Why are there so few people who appreciate ""Meet Joe Black"" as the absolutely perfect film it is !?  Undoubtedly my favorite motion picture of 1998  (and I sat through over 250 of them), it is a simply beautiful look at the poetry of life and death.  An intoxicating, mesmerizing film of macabre dark humor and romantic fantasy.  Brad Pitt (not just another pretty boy given his choice of roles) is better than ever...and I stand in awe of Anthony Hopkins--who gracefully paints the portrait of a man of dignity and honor like few we see in movies anymore.  I am moved every time I see this film-- I connect (and not everyone does); with it's representation of everything there is to love in a given lifetime...love between two people, love for your work, love amongst family; and the importance of saying goodbye.  I'm a wreck, I'm reduced to a blubbering sissy for almost the entire last half hour  (and that lovely ""nice pictures"" moment with the old lady in the hospital)  I'm almost emotional typing this review !!! -- How do I respond to criticism of it being boring ?  Impatience.    I'll admit it's slowly paced.  But, its length is a benefit to the story.  So few filmmakers take the time and energy (and nowadays, the guts) to flesh out the aspects of a given story --this is what makes great movies people !!! I've also heard complaints about the pregnant pauses--long stretches of silence during one on one conversations between characters that 'seem to exist simply to draw things out longer'.  Kids, acting is about more than words...check out what Pitt and  Hopkins are doing in those beautiful moments of silence :  look  at their eyes, watch their face....THEY'RE ACTING !!!  Those so-called unnecessary moments of silence shared between characters are priceless in the form of character development. Thank God for Martin Brest; it's four screenwriters; and the entire cast (Jeffrey Tambor will have his day). Thanks to all of them, along came a movie that I can add to the very short list of movies that I can honestly say changed my life."

","The mere sight of Brad Pitt caused a movie audience full of women to gasp aloud.  That doesn't make ""Meet Joe Black"" a bad movie, but it sure makes it harder to concentrate on the man's acting ability.  The fact is however, that this film directed by Martin Brest (Scent of a Woman, Midnight Run) is full of passion, romance, drama, and great bursts of humour.<br/><br/>In ""Meet Joe Black"" William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) begins to suspect his mortality during an episode of crushing chest pains. Death comes for Parrish having manifested itself in the form of a mysterious and engaging young man, Joe Black (Pitt).  Black decides to put off the inevitable journey for a few days so he can learn more about life from the human perspective. He chooses to experience life with the family of this extremely wealthy, highly successful businessman who is just days away from his 65th birthday.  A gala birthday party fit for a king is being prepared by one of Parrish's daughters, Allison (Marcia Gay Harden).   Her role as the fussing, detail driven party organizer is a moving one as she comes to understand that despite her overwhelming love for her father, she will never be his favourite.  The role of favourite daughter is left to Susan (Clair Forlani) and Joe Black learns his most important life lessons as he and Susan fall in love.<br/><br/>The story unfolds naturally at a leisurely pace using up every moment of the 3-hour length without ever losing the audience.  Anthony Hopkins, plays the role of powerful patriarch and business mogul with a strong dignified presence and says more with a raised eyebrow and half smile than any dialogue could impart.<br/><br/>It is interesting to watch Pitt as death, ageless by any standard, wise beyond comprehension stumble confused in his new human form.  Pitt plays with this role and is not afraid to show an insecure almost goofy persona as Joe Black begins to experience life as a man.  In the course of his activities with Parrish's life, Joe learns the human pain of ""letting go"" experiencing the greatest lessons as his love for Susan grows.  Joe Black's slow awakening to love and the physical realities of expressed love are a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The theme is clear: Life can be endured if there is love, and love can only be sustained on a foundation of truth.  And it's the truth that ultimately undoes Joe Black, the man.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. **** 4 STAR RATING ON A 5 STAR SCALE"

","I enjoyed this film immensely. A fable about Death coming to earth as an atheist and leaving as an angel is going to test a lot of people's ideas about film as entertainment, including the film's producers. Brad Pitt is a major draw card and has a number of good scenes, but for me his Death lacked authority. Anthony Hopkins kept the piece going though with a convincing performance of the businessman out-negotiated in the ultimate deal. Jake Weber's Drew was also good, deftly handling the character we like at first but would grow to hate as we got to know him better. I heard friends complain of trite dialogue. Yet, talking is the opposite of what this film is about: I loved the pared down dialogue and the use of silence (how do you converse with Death?). Non-verbal communication gradually increased through the film and was triumphant in the climactic scene with Pitt and Forlani. This scene was a winner for me: from being  a scene of a large party crowd, the camera pulls focus while the crowd soundtrack disappears and we are in the intensely private and concentrated moment of these two characters. Susan's love is without restriction, even knowing who he is and that he won't stay; Joe's receipt of that love and his new-found capacity for love in return converts him from Grim Reaper to Angel of Life. Only hardened cynics or those who missed the cinema door to the action flick will leave without a smile or a tear or both."

","Going into the theater to watch this film I was expecting two things.  The first was that I'd be there for quite awhile (it's nearly 3 hours long). The second thing I was expecting to see, were two great actors show why they are among the best in Hollywood today (Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins).  I firmly believe that Brad Pitt is the best actor in films today (he often gets too little credit for his acting abilities due to his sex appeal and that's unfortunate).  As far as the length of the film is concerned.yea, it is long for a non-epic type of film, but I was amazed by how quickly the 178 minutes seem to go by.<br/><br/>One of the best things about MJB is the way the film develops it's characters.  Director Martin Brest does something in MJB that too few films do today.he makes you actually care about what happens to the characters you see on the screen.  Some people may find many of the early ""setup scenes"" to be boring and useless.  I, on the other hand, feel that those scenes are the one's that really bring us into Joe Black (Pitt) and William Parrish's (Hopkins) world.  To end without mentioning Claire Forlani would be a crime. She does a wonderful job as Susan Parrish (Hopkins daughter) and I look forward to seeing her in more films in the very near future.<br/><br/>MJB is an outstanding film that is filled with some amazing dialogue.  In addition to that it is: a great romantic film, a surprisingly funny film at times, and most importantly it is the most touching film that I have seen since ""Titanic"" (I fully admit that I may feel this way due to the fact that I have a daughter to call my own.  Having a daughter enables me to relate to the father-daughter scenes, which are incredibly done by Hopkins, Forlani, and Martin Brest).     Grade: A"

","Forget all the bad press you've heard about this movie.  ""Meet Joe Black"" is a wonderful celebration of life and, yes, death.  Is the pace slow? Yes. Is the movie over-long?  Yes.  But the direction and the cast more than make up for it with deep, three-sided characters.  All the pieces of the story fit together nicely and there are reverberations of certain lines throughout the movie.  Words literally come back to haunt the characters (and the viewer). And that orgasmic burst of fireworks in the final frames of the film?  In case you didn't pick up on it, that's a celebration of life and love!  See this one to remember the important things in your life; see it with the one you love."

","If there's one thing I can't stand in a film, it's when you have the feeling that this could have been a brilliant film, but some one along the line messed it up and now it's mediocre. I find those films harder to watch than the average twelve in a dozen action flix because I hate it when potential is wasted. And that's basically the story of Meet Joe Black.<br/><br/>It's slow, beautiful, and in places very intense. No special effects apart from some fireworks (I think that is worth a special mention these days), long studies of the emotions that play over the faces of the main characters. But it just doesn't make it really good. The long pauses have you grip your seat in frustration, the subplot involving a hostile take-over is just plain silly and messes up the main plot too much, and finally and most importantly the lines of Death are just not well thought out.<br/><br/>For some one who has looked at mankind since the beginning, he is surprisingly stupid. But if the plot requires, suddenly Death has the insight of ages again. I can imagine him marveling at new experiences such as taste and having a human body with tons of hormones running wild in it, but the script has him react like a total moron half of the time.<br/><br/>I can see why my friends, and so many other viewers liked it. But I left this film utterly frustrated and gave it a harsh verdict for not making what could have been a great film."

This is a very different type of movie that seems to have been misunderstood due to its subtle nature.<br/><br/>Unlike most artificial-adrenaline-action-packed blockbuster movies, this movie seems almost real.  The dialogue and the speed of the plot developments seemed realistic instead of 'picture-perfect'.  At times it almost seemed more like theatre than a movie.  In fact, I think the director has managed to make an extraordinarily unbelievable idea, seem almost plausible.  It may not be the ultimately ideal implementation of these ideas and techniques - but I think this movie deserves some credit for breaking new ground.  It was very different and very interesting."

The four writers surely could have done more with the ingredients they were given.  A promising young doctor and Death?  They just let the opportunity slide. Anthony Hopkins did his usual performance, but possibly the best act was Jeffrey Tambor, playing the apple-short-of-an-orchard manipulatable guy married into a New York boardroom.

But a very good performance was played by Brad Pitt. The way he changed characters as if he really was a different person was exceptional. Overall, it wasn't bad.

There are a lot of subtle hints and throw away remarks which you simply tend to miss first time around, especially those of the delightful supporting cast.  Jake Weber as Drew is particularly enjoyable.  The elder daughter, Alison, says at one point ""I should get my head examined again.""  This is just about the only clue we ever have to suggest that life in the Parrish family is not idyllic, and it is simply left hanging, not followed up.  Like real life in fact.<br/><br/>The sets are fabulous; it is worth seeing for Bill Parrish's library alone.

"cbale","10","0","0","13 November 1998"," Gently paced, emotional comedy drama
","""Meet Joe Black"" is well written, gently paced, very funny and very touching with tremendous performances from Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani and Brad Pitt.<br/><br/>Yes, I said Brad Pitt gave a tremendous performance as Death-Joe Black/Young-Man-in-Coffee-Shop.  He plays the part of Death using Brad Pitt's classic body as if he has never been in a human body before.  As an actor playing this role, Brad Pitt chose to walk stiffly with virtually no mannerisms as if he were a spirit inhabiting an unknown organism.  I enjoyed watching him act out the consequences of this decision. He is also very funny throughout the movie acting in ways unlike any of the other characters.  He especially stands out from the crowd in the boardroom scenes.  He is amazing in scenes with a hospital patient who has recognized him for what he is.<br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins is marvelous as William Parish, head of Parrish Communications.  Parrish finds out a few days before his 65th birthday that Death will take him as soon as Death is done experiencing life on earth.  He knows the penalty for arguing the Death-Joe Black is instant death, and yet he stays true to himself to the end.  This is seemingly casual performance by Hopkins is very strong.  His heart attack sequence early in the movie is gut wrenching. He is tender with his daughters, decisive with his board of directors and mystified by his relationship with Death.<br/><br/>Claire Forlani is a find as Parrish's favorite daughter.  There is a cool, reluctant and yet trusting chemistry between her character, Susan, and Joe Black.  Their body language is enhanced by close camerawork in tender scenes, slow moving, emotion-filled scenes.<br/><br/>The movie is long.  I looked forward to spending 174 minutes with Brad Pitt. But I hated his last movie with Anthony Hopkins (""Legends of the Fall"") so was instantly wary when I heard about the running length.  Watching the film, I loved the care the directory takes with each scene, each line of dialogue, each nuanced use of the word ""yes"".  The script is excellent.  The ending was very satisfying.  The film requires thought from the moviegoer. Some folks may not get the nuances, and may miss one of Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins best movies.  I hereby nominate Claire Forlani for best supporting actress."
"Aidy","7","0","0","9 February 1999"," Great beginning, good middle, slow end
","In this movie Brad Pitt plays Death on vacation in a human body.  I have to start out by saying that the car accident in with which he obtains his host is the best RTA I have ever seen comitted to film.  Genuinely disturbing, but not as disturbing as the people who insist on laughing at unfunny things in the cinema.<br/><br/>Following from the interesting beginning the movie moves slightly into 'fish out of water' mode.  However it dabbles in this genre just the right amount. It doesn't go overboard as you would expect in a kids' film, and these moments show Pitt at his best.<br/><br/>As we approach the middle of the film, the romantic interests come out and things do start to slow down.  Some scenes are torturously drawn out and over-long.<br/><br/>Having been charmed by Pitt's character, we now come to realise that by not being human Pitt doesn't just not know which knife to use at dinner, or what peanut-butter is, but he doesn't understand the love or comittment that humans can demonstrate for each other.  He doesn't realise that human beings are not toys that you can just take without paying for.<br/><br/>Come the latter part of the movie things have all but ground to a halt. This movie could easily lose half an hour.  It is very unfortunate as the ending *is* good, just tainted by the length of time taken to resolve plot points.<br/><br/>All in all quite an original film, but you are forced to suffer somewhat before they give up the goods.

Once it does, it grabs your attention for the remainder of the film; you don't want it to end but you know it has to -- Death didn't stop over for nothing, after all. Add West Indian accents to Mr Pitt's repertoire and a sensuousness that remains beyond compare (as a couple Pitt & Forlani have got definite repeat-appeal).  Hopkins is great, as usual, and must never rest for the quantity of excellent films in which he's partaken over the past year.

","Director Martin Brest has helped himself to an exquisite sense of film making. He has not only managed to portray a story full of glittering, genuine and young romance but he has also been able to include a philosophical questioning within the plot.<br/><br/>The question about death being a being just like humans, and if so, how would it be different from us in a sense of perceptions. Brad Pitt as death may not be what some of us will imagine it to be like but it sure is magical view from the director, that because it is unique turns out to be quite successful. Images that transmit a great spiritual meaning as well as a completely heart stopping quality in photography and music entertain the audience in what may originally seem a long period of time, but it is compensed with orchestration by Thomas Newman.<br/><br/>The actors' effort is surely exemplified on screen. Anthony Hopkins delivers a magnificent performance in a character that faces a difficult question in his own life: What happens when your death is also your own daughter's? Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani show great on screen chemistry and it seem that they are growing as actors, since it is evident that they have gone deeply not only into their character's actions but their emotions as well.<br/><br/>Overall an enthusiastic film, that in a dramatic and yet hilarious way teaches you about life, death and all kinds of love."

Admittedly the time could have been reduced somewhat, there is often long, unnecessary silences and a few sub-plots that could have been removed. The film is however highly amusing if you allow yourself to be open to the humour. Pitt's portrayal of death is amusing, warm and well attempted since he couldn't exactly research the part! Hopkins, as always, gives a powerful, moving performance which really holds the rest of the cast and Forlani plays her part with a quiet dignity that suits Susan.

","I caught the last 5 minutes of this film on television and was mesmerized. I looked up Anthony Hopkins' film biography on IMDb to learn the name of the film in order to see it in entirety. What a fruitful effort! Watching the DVD was such a treat I watched it at least 5 times in a week!<br/><br/>The film is long enough and delves into the characters' lives in such detail that we become old friends with most of the major characters by the end of the 3 hours. Only the despicable Drew character is thankfully left a mystery.<br/><br/>Bill Parrish is a giant both in business and in his family life. He is so powerful that the lives of all his family revolve around him. His 2 daughters adore him and depend on him emotionally, even his married older daughter Allison. This unhealthy dependence partly springs from the loss of their mother at a young age. Bill loved his wife so much that he never remarried, focusing all his energies on his business and his daughters.<br/><br/>Bill has always wished for a son and subconsciously seeks to fulfill this desire by supporting his top aide and prospective son-in-law Drew. Younger daughter Susan senses Bill's desire for her to marry Drew and continue the dynasty, since her career as a physician is not going to involve Bill's business empire. Susan seems willing to marry Drew to please her father, but her lukewarm romance troubles Bill. He wants Susan to have all the passion and joy he experienced in his marriage and this will likely never happen with Drew. Susan probably senses that beneath the pleasing exterior, Drew is a monster.<br/><br/>Allison has always played second fiddle to Susan. She has always wanted to be the apple of Daddy's eye, to little effect. She has suffered mental problems and a raging inferiority complex. She marries Quince, a man obviously in far over his head trying to function as a board member of Parrish Communications. Quince is easily manipulated into providing the information necessary for Drew to topple Bill from his position as board chairman. Quince has the redeeming virtue of a good heart and a willingness to face his failure and seek Bill's forgiveness.<br/><br/>Allison tries to win daddy's favor by organizing an over-the-top 65th birthday party for him. Bill detests the concept, but grudgingly tolerates the project to keep peace with Allison. Allison continually pesters Bill to make trivial decisions about aspects of the upcoming party while he is consumed with anxiety about his business and his impending death. Eventually Allison senses the need to make peace with her father and accepts that she will have to settle for second place in his affections.<br/><br/>Susan visits a coffee shop near her hospital and has a fateful encounter with a compelling young man who has all the qualities she finds lacking in Drew. She is strongly drawn to the young man and is shaken to the core by her instant attraction. She is both thrilled and appalled by the encounter that threatens to disrupt her life. She starts to see Drew in an unfavorable light in comparison to the nameless young man. Susan turns a corner on the way to work and fails to see the young man killed by oncoming traffic as he lingers in crossing the street, distracted with thoughts of her.<br/><br/>Death, wanting to interact on the human plane with Bill Parrish finds the young man the perfect vessel to inhabit to accomplish his purpose. Death heals the young man's injuries and utilizes the body to visit Bill and act as a quasi-member of the Parrish family. Death has developed few social skills over the eons and acts in innocent outrage of social norms. Bill is forced to tolerate a great deal of bad behavior from his visitor in order to live a few more days. Death is given a name, Joe Black, in order to make social intercourse possible.<br/><br/>Susan meets the mysterious young man later the same day. She attends a family dinner, only to find him sitting at the table with her family. He announces that he will be staying at the Parrish townhouse and Bill dares not challenge the decision.<br/><br/>Joe Black is strangely different from the man in the coffee shop. He is socially awkward, mysterious, powerful, and dangerous behind his pleasant conversation. Joe's relationship with Bill is outrageous and unexplained. Susan sees her father yield to Joe on many issues where he would never submit to anyone else. Susan has several encounters with Joe that enhance her attraction to him while upsetting her on another level. He refuses to explain his relationship with her father or what purpose lies behind his visit.<br/><br/>Eventually, Drew explodes in rage at Joe's influence on Bill and Susan and ends his relationship with Susan. Susan has another encounter with Joe that ends in her bedroom. It is amusing to see Joe reacting to all the instinctive responses of his body with great confusion. Susan has to make the first move to get things rolling. Joe's awkward responses to Susan's advances are met with great amusement and tolerance. The story hints that Joe proves an apt pupil in the arts of love.<br/><br/>The story ends with Drew's horrific plan defeated and Bill saying goodbye to his family. He bravely marches out to meet his fated end. Death yields control of the young man's body and Joe returns to the man he was in the coffee shop. Joe and Susan pick up where they left off and walk hand in hand to a life together.<br/><br/>This film is so rich in meaning and character development, it will take me many more viewings to see it all. A prospect I look forward to with delight. A huge THANK YOU to all those artists involved in the creation of this gem!"

"thomas196x2000","4","2","5","5 September 2006"," Why very little middle ground?
","Having been lurking on this site for quite a while, some fellow writers have arrived at the conclusion that some movies apparently have their creative team or fan club jump on the site to deluge it with high praise. I typically dismissed such claims, but with a movie like this, I have to wonder. Seriously, 10 out of 10 stars? Casablanca material here? Citizen Kane?<br/><br/>I agree with some of the readers here that the first part of the movie has energy and engaging dialog and I kept thinking, what happened as the movie progressed? Hmm, let's see the problems I have with it.<br/><br/>Claire Forlani--It took me a while to figure out what it is about her that bothers me...it's as if she is trying to prevent her lower eyelids from coming up and closing her eyes. Like she is constantly battling it. Then at other times, she just closes her eyes while she talks. Is she on Demerol? Watch her next time and you will not be able to stop thinking about it.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt--First, his character at the beginning is interesting. As Death, he is not. I could care less if he wants to experience being human. I don't exactly feel compassion for him. He falls in love, then he is a smart azz to Hopkins when Hopkins objects to him using his daughter as a test lab for his feelings. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins--His performance was, as typical, very good. It's as if the movie starts MOVING again when he comes on screen. However, I have problems with his character. Why, when he got upset at Death fooling around with his daughter, and objected about it, and Death basically said ""Too bad"", did he say, ""What are you going to do, kill me?"" Everyone was waiting for him to say that. Also, as to show the screenwriters dearth of ideas, they don't give us anything interesting to chew on. If you were Hopkins, wouldn't you be asking ""Where do we go when you take me""? What's it like? Where did you come from? What can you really see? His character doesn't ask these questions because the screenwriters aren't creative enough to come up with anything.<br/><br/>Length--Lots have been said about the films length. Perhaps some people can become more engrossed than others. But man does this film go on. There are whole scenes that don't need to be there, then they ramble. The last scene even drags on and on...walk over the damn bridge already!<br/><br/>What's good about the film:<br/><br/>1) Central idea 2) Supporting actors like Tambor 3) Cinematography and overall ""look"" 4) Anthony Hopkins<br/><br/>So, overall a fair package. I can enjoy a moving, romantic or sentimental film. But long passages of nothing happening, with piano music draped over it, does not make the scenes for me automatically moving, or profound, or even interesting.<br/><br/>One of the other writers I read wrote that he left the theater a number of times and came back. This is one of those few films that you can do that with, because very little actually does happen during the course of the film.<br/><br/>10 stars? Geez."

","I find it very difficult to express any kind words about this movie. When I saw that this movie has a 6.6 IMDb rating, it just reassured my opinion that unfortunately the public cannot be trusted when it comes to rating movies. This movie is really bad. Really, really bad! The only pleasure I have derived from this movie and ultimately viewing it's IMDb home is seeing the awards it has been nominated for and has received. I won't spoil the fun, just look for yourself. It would appear that the general selling point for this movie is the presence of the two stars, Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins. Both are outstanding actors who have been placed in roles where they are essentially not required to act. Brad Pitt basically stands around the whole movie with that cute Brad Pitt look on his face. Anthony Hopkins, bless his heart, seems to be saying ""What am I doing here? How could I have taken this role?"" Forget this bomb and go rent The Elephant Man or Fight Club."

It proved to be the movie substitute for a soap opera, with death taking over a human body rather than someone coming back to life after being dead for two years. The dialogue bordered on corny, and the characters were all too idealized and familiar. While the acting itself was fine, there was something lacking to engage the viewer who wasn't a fantasy-fanatic. The idea is an interesting one, but could lacked any substance for an enjoyable story.

The characters in this movie are too superficial and death is too nice at best, personally I think he's ridiculous, he's romantisized to death. (Please excuse the pun, I couldn't help myself.) Also, I have to wonder how death,as he behaves like autistic person in periods of the movie, suddenly becomes quite brilliant and ""with it"" at the end. The movie doesn't really have a climax either, it's all very nice and predictable, very, very Hollywoodish.

","Remake of a movie launched in 1934 and whose name was ""Death takes a holiday"", ""Meet Joe Black"" must be very inferior to the original movie although I didn't see it. This is the typical movie with a good idea but badly exploited. Here, death is epitomized by a good-looking young man (Brad Pitt) and he'd like to know why men dread so much death. He's settling down in the life of a well-off man (Anthony Hopkins) and his daughter falls in love with Pitt.<br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie whose result isn't convincing at all. The screenplay is very repetitive with annoying cues (Pitt who often asks for peanut butter) and contains a few weaknesses like Pitt's weird car crash at the beginning of the movie. Besides, this is probably one of Pitt's weakest performances to date. He leans too much on his physical appearance and I find him too inexpressive.<br/><br/>It's also a movie that is terribly long-winded and it drags on. A flat and listless film-making doesn't help matters. It focuses too much on the actors' faces as if it wanted to define their feelings.<br/><br/>At last, this is an overlong movie and in three hours you find time to be bored because nearly nothing's happening.

Coincidentally, the rich guy has a daughter, who's always hanging around her dad, who happens to have met and been quite infatuated with the guy whose body death has borrowed just that morning. She's a doctor and of course falls in love with death.<br/><br/>If you're like me, you'll find it very hard to relate to any of this. I can't really being myself to sympathize with this death dude, and I don't find his infatuation with peanut butter a deep symbol of how we must appreciate the good things in life. It's just a lot of facepalms and heavy sighing and looking at the elapsed time to see how much more there is to endure if like me you're curious to see what they cooked up to give this adventure its ""happy ending"".<br/><br/>It's probably well acted, it certainly is well filmed and there is nothing to suggest a lack of funding.

Yes, the story is a bit cheesy but since when did every film have to carry some sort of deep message ? This one has a rather old fashioned sentimental, romantic bent and it's none the worse for that; the musical accompaniment is dated, but isn't it so much better than the modern garbage ?<br/><br/>I would have really loved this film except for one thing - the sound quality. The musical background so often drowns out the soft, half mumbled speech of the characters - is it my television or my ears ? No, I've no problems with either, so it's down to the production.<br/><br/>While Hopkins delivers his lines clearly, for the most part, Pitt and Claire Forlani, both speak so quietly, or mumble US style, as to make their words almost unintelligible under the horribly loud ""background"" music. I love the music, but I'd really like to hear the words of the actors too.<br/><br/>I think it's a rather lovely film; simple and straightforward. It has messages about love and family, loyalty and betrayal, honesty and deceit, but none of these take over. No one turns up to shoot the bad guys or rescue the good ones; it's old fashioned sentimental schmaltz.

Problems arise however when Death falls for Susan yet he can't tell her of his true identity as he is only here to help her father reach the aftermath. The score is very haunting as it reminds me of a score James Horner would do(even though its Thomas Newman) that is over the score.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Claire and Brad was good and both Brad and his co star from Legends Of The Fall(Hopkins) was great too.<br/><br/>The only gripe I have with this film is the running time as its on for a whooping 3 hour and 6 minutes. To be fair I think it should have been on for an hour and 50 minutes as the extra 2 hours is literally about William and his business company which makes the film boring and bland.

The story line seems rather simple until the twist comes and it gets a little challenging for a lot of us to handle. The good news is that while we are trying to come to grips with the surface story, the creators sneak in a second slow moving tale of the limitless power of true love. They address a father's love, a daughter's love, the love between a man and a woman and most importantly the film makers get into superficial convenient love. Power over others can cause us to be selfish. This story highlights the brightest version of power and love.

I don't understand her thinking after seeing him acting like a completely different person. He's either faking the first encounter or he's faking later. At the very least, he's up to no good. The movie seems to use Pitt's pretty face as a patch-all for any deficiencies. Basically she falls for two different personalities.

His ""holiday"" is complicated when he falls for Parrish's daughter (Claire Forlani).<br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" (1998) is a re-imagining of the 1934 film ""Death Takes a Holiday"" (which I've never seen). It has the confidence to take its time at almost 3 hours, but is so captivating that it feels shorter than most 90-minute mindless flicks.

One good example is when Parrish's son-in-law (Jeffrey Tambor) offers a definition of love to Joe Black: To know the worst thing about someone and it's okay, presuming they're penitent.

So, that is saying something about this one. Meet Joe Black is a film that focuses more on looks from its characters than the dialog actually spoken. Yet, this screenplay is also fantastic because of some of the amazing lines that are spoken. <br/><br/>When describing to his daughter what love is truly about, William Parish (played by Anthony Hopkins) describes it as ""forgetting you head and thinking with your heart"". Now, how more true of a definition of love is there? I surely can't think of one. He also tells his daughter Susan (played by Claire Forlani) to keep her options open rather than marry her fiancée by saying, ""lightning could strike"". And lightning does strike, within a few hours coincidently, as Susan meets The Man in the Coffee Shop (played by Brad Pitt), who completed blows her mind away and causes her to go weak at the knees for one whom she has only just met. But, when Mr. Lightning is suddenly killed in a car accident and shows up at Susan's home, he informs her father that he is in fact Death, having taken the body of the man Susan met so that he can experience life before taking William. ""What matters is that I stay interested... and in return you get TIME."" William takes Death, who is using the name Joe Black as a disguise, under his wing to show him the world. Susan is confused by the sudden change of personality from the man she met in the coffee shop to Joe, not knowing that the man she met has died or that the body before her is Death, planning to take her father when the time comes. But, Susan falls for Joe, and he even more so for her. And when Joe threatens to take Susan with him, William attempts to protect his daughter by informing Joe that it is not he that Susan is in love with... it is the idea of the man he once was before his untimely demise... that she is still in love with the Man in the Coffee Shop, and that everything since has been nothing but aftermath. He also tells Joe that he doesn't truly love Susan. ""To take whatever you like because it pleases you, that's not love. It's missing everything that matters."" <br/><br/>Aside from the incredible acting in this picture, Meet Joe Black has emotion behind the looks that the actors give to one another, that says everything that needs to be said without dialog even being needed. Meet Joe Black is a 3 hour movie, with a third act and ending that takes up almost 45 minutes of time. But, the payoff is spectacularly well-done, with a finale that'll pull at the heartstrings of any true story lover. You come to realize that to Meet Joe Black is nothing quite out of the ordinary. After all, everyone eventually does."
"SamWanjere","8","1","2","9 March 2012"," Review: Meet Joe Black (1998)
","Where do I start from with this movie?<br/><br/>Brad Pitt's eyes are so dreamy, for the deeply romantic. Susan, the girl he falls in love with is as starry eyed and trusting in a really refreshing manner. Witty girls will win me over any day. Anthony Hopkins is imperious and dominant, his quiet intelligence a hallmark of his acting performance. A mention for the heel in this movie, Drew.<br/><br/>The ending to this movie is absolutely magnificent, with impressive dialogue amidst a light- filled, fireworks lit sky. I felt sorry when Death realizes Susan doesn't love him as death, but loves the young man's body he took. Joe Black and Hopkin's character walking over the distant arch and the young man who'd died earlier reappearing is a good touch.<br/><br/>Good screen chemistry from the cast, clever dialogue, witty romanticisms when Joe speaks to Susan. Good movie."
"betelgeuse-6","10","1","2","23 November 2010"," A Rare Film
","I saw this marvelous movie for the first time last month. I have no idea how I missed it; maybe there's a reason<br/><br/>In a way, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a science fiction film, a genre which, if done well and done with sincerity, consistency and resonant meaning, is one of my favorites. It is said that in the best science fiction stories you are asked to believe in only one unbelievable thing. In the case of this movie, that one thing is that Death is a person and he is on a vacation from the ""function"" he performs in order to see, up close, what life is. He wants to know rapture and beauty and love and pain and the meaning of death to the living, to taste, touch, feel, hear, and see. Death starts out as a wide-eyed, yet head-strong child, goes through selfish adolescence and grows into sadder but wiser old age. In the end, he learns to love life in all its contradictions and complexities and is, himself, loath to leave it. <br/><br/>The movie is knowingly conceived and exquisitely presented down to the smallest details, the most nuanced expressions of faces and eyes. The photographer in me recognizes and appreciates in this film the care and attention given to every scene and especially to the noble potential of the human face, the souls seen through those eyes. The performances of Claire Forlani, Brad Pitt, and Anthony Hopkins are perhaps the best of their careers, and the lines they speak are never obvious, shrill, or trite. Jeffrey Tambor's portrayal of Quince is honest and kind and is subtly pivotal to the film. Indeed, all of the performances are of the highest quality.<br/><br/>And then there's the music. The poignancy, sensitivity and emotional impact of Thomas Newman's score is unparalleled. That he has never won an Academy Award is all the proof one needs that there are times when the Hollywood establishment just doesn't get it. <br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" is a three-hour philosophical ballet of fabulous faces and beautiful places, inside and out, that speaks to the mind and the heart.<br/><br/>""It nice it happen to you. It like you came to Cat Island and you had a holiday, sun didn't burn you red, just brown, sleep no mosquito eat you, rum no pound you head nex' day. But trut' is, dat bound to happen, you stay long enough. So tak dat nice picture home wi' you, but don' be fooled. We lonely here mostly, too. If we lucky, we got some nice pictures.""<br/><br/>No movie I know of has taken on the issues of life, love and death so directly nor handled them with such sensitivity and honesty."
"Victover","7","1","2","25 August 2009"," A great story spoiled to the point of Good by the director
","An unusual plot made quite believable by a skillful director who caught himself up in a few excesses and at least one very childish treatment of the main sub plot resolution, stopped this movie from being almost perfect. I found particularly effective the romantic angle from the very beginning with a shocking accident setting the basis for a quite well achieved notion that death him/herself actually enters the picture to announce a tycoon on his 60 something birthday at the top of his successful career that his days are literally running out. In doing this, Pitt and Hopkins are at their best and both of them manage to treat their character in a manner that leaves no loose ends. The rest of the story surrounding the core idea is full of interesting, romantic, funny and well acted scenes and just left it at that the movie is a 10. Then, unfortunately you feel sorry by having to remove fractions of a point here and there just because for the director enough wasn't enough. Never. As a result, you have endless watery eyes, stares, smiles, more watery eyes, lots of hugs, stuff like that. And to top it all, the big revelation: the coup de grace for a rather annoying character, instead of an obvious and tremendous blow like saying ""I think by now you should know that I'm the Death Himself"" or anything really right to the point, with the silly cooperation from Hopkins, Joe Black delivers ""I.......... aaaaaam an ins....pec.....tooooor of..... the..... Inter.......nal......Re...ve...nue Service"". A fatal piece of info, I guess, worse than death in a capitalist environment.<br/><br/>Finally, a bit of a replica of the Beijing fireworks, more and more watery eyes to the point of the audience wondering why aren't we done with the whole thing yet, pleeease!! Still, a good movie. But prepare yourself."
"guynaba","9","1","2","4 July 2009"," It is worth the three hours
","When William Parrish is about to die, Death, in the body of Brad Pitt makes a deal with him: he will live longer than planned as long as William be his guide in Earth.<br/><br/>After the deal the story develops in a very natural way. Death proves the Earth' passions one by one (food, desire, love, anger) and these moments make the movie be worth it. Brad Pitt knew how to act like a naive child discovering a new world, and, at the same time, like a serious and cold creature.<br/><br/>Claire Forlani also made an outstanding job. It's impossible to imagine another actress to interpret Susan, the beautiful, shy and naive William's daughter. Both roles (Death and Susan) worked perfect together, what contributes to the success of the movie.<br/><br/>The negative point is the length of the movie. The movie itself is not too long, but the scenes are. There are some that it takes about 10 seconds for the character to say something, and this slows down the rhythm so much."
"green-c","5","1","2","31 August 2005"," Great story line, but far too drawn out...
","When I started to watch this movie, I was extremely interested, but as it continued, I became less & less so. The story itself is awesome, but the movie was just too slow moving for me. Maybe I'm just someone who doesn't appreciate a slow climax, but this was just like peanut butter running up hill. With Anthony Hopkins & Brad Pitt being some of my favorite actors, I was rather disappointed. <br/><br/>Meet Joe Black, a movie with a handful of funny scenes, romance, and a few heartfelt ones as well. All in all, an average movie that could have been a lot better, had someone pressed fast-forward. If your not an action fan, it's definitely for you."
"davek28","5","1","2","20 August 2005"," Needs editing down to 30 minutes or so
","I love Claire Forlani and felt sorry for her wasting so much acting talent in this long-winded overblown pretence of a movie.<br/><br/>There are so many holes in the 'Death Takes a Vacation' plot that as soon as Mr Pitt got his I was wishing that he hadn't and it had been developed as a straight realistic love story between Susan and Thingy (Pitt - we never find out his character's real name).<br/><br/>So we get to see even more of the rich side of America and how angst-ridden they all are.<br/><br/>And don't even get me going on that laughable stuff with the terminally ill Jamaican woman and Pitt's patois.<br/><br/>No wonder I prefer European films. I get so fed up of this kind if US tripe, full of faux sentimentality and Life Lessons.<br/><br/>And finally - Susan seemed to figure out exactly what Joe Black was, and that he'd been switched back with the original guy that she met in the coffee shop. HOW???<br/><br/>A friend of mine lent me this DVD on the basis that it's the best film she (note - She) has ever seen and she watches it repeatedly. Maybe if Brad Pitt (miscast, in my opinion) hadn't been in it she might have thought differently.<br/><br/>Sorry for the rant, but I just had to let it all out. I feel better now."
"tonya921","10","1","2","15 August 2005"," Absolutely awe-inspiring.
","This flick has one of the best casts I have seen for this type of drama. They act exquisitely well together, and it shows in the emotion brought forth in each and every scene. I love the way the characters pause between lines, as if they are truly living in the moment. <br/><br/>Anthony Hopkins uses his traditional crescendo and decrescendo in the conversations, and it makes every scene he is in wonderful to watch. Claire Forlani is absolutely breathtaking, as usual. She displays her emotions in this movie with such elegance. She appears to be a very strong woman, using her intellect even in the characters she plays. Her relationship with her father, Anthony Hopkins, is something every little girl dreams of. The couple played by Marcia Gay Harden and Jeffrey Tambor display what appears like true affection for each other. They complement each other perfectly. If you love to hate someone in films, then ""Drew,"" played by Jake Weber is your man in this one. He is despicable. <br/><br/>In all, I have seen this movie a total of 20 times, or more. I lost count. However, I never grow tired of watching it. It is spellbinding and although I am NOT an emotional person by any means, I cry during this movie every time I watch it. I would recommend it to anyone who would like to see a truly great movie with a great performance from all actors involved."
"andwhyamidoingthis","10","1","2","6 August 2005"," Beautifully human movie...
","Meet Joe Black was a fabulous movie! What excellent casting, and the acting shone. What was best, however, was the humanity of the story. It would have been easy to play these characters as clichés, cynics, or totally clueless. That didn't happen here. The characters are flawed, earnest, confused, and very true. Whether rolling in the depths of selfishness or attempting to find a life path for themselves, they all prove very real and fascinating, particularly as you have the opportunity to see humanity through Joe's eyes. The Joe character was another surprise. Who would have thought an immortal could be so human? Curious, quick, and self-involved to a fault. Wonderful! The fabulous acting and excellent story made the movie very easy to watch all the way through, something I have trouble doing... Worth a watch, definitely!"
"c-ramshaw","10","1","2","24 July 2005"," A slow psychological tidal wave of art
","This movie affected me on a very deep level. I agree with one of the other comments that in order to appreciate its message, you need to watch it several times with long breaks in between. For me, it was about the fluidity, fragility and powerlessness of life against the concept of death. It asks the unanswerable : who or what is directing our individual fate. It also implicitly discusses the superficial qualities of life : the different masks we all like to wear to impress. Death seems to come, only to wear a mask and study other masks, forcing the characters to see behind each other. In the end, death is forced to take off his own mask and suffer the experience of loss. It becomes more moving the more times you watch it. It is a slow-moving, psychological tidal wave of quality art. However, for those who don't wish to have their thoughts provoked about the mystery of life and death, it may be tiresome and a bit boring."
"soccermanz","8","1","2","23 July 2005"," Meet Joe Black but of course we don't
","So much more could have been made out of this script as the denouement is weak in extremis and the ending simply doesn't hold together but if I explained why I might spoil what was still a thoroughly enjoyable film. But then I think that Brad Pitt was totally miscast as Death - a Roger Black but not as tall but with more acting experience. I would have preferred a version of Death closer to that in the Grolsch Advert and certainly black but then he would have had to be Mr White would't he ? And the ""speaking in tongues"" would have been both more authentic and relevant. Anthony Hopkins gave yet another thoroughly warm and dignified performance and Ms Forlani really did look love struck but the whole saving the family company bit didn't work nearly as well as in ""Pretty Woman"". All in all a good effort but perhaps a wasted opportunity but well worth seeing to make up your own mind."
"JWBly","7","1","2","24 June 2005"," A pleasant surprise!
","I just finished watching this movie. What a pleasant surprise! Either it was woefully under-advertised or I was living under a rock at the time, but this movie is well worth seeing. I sat down to watch it just because it had the great Anthony Hopkins in it. I did not even know until his appearance that Brad Pitt was even associated with this project. Normally I consider Pitt a ""woman's actor"" in that he acts primarily in films that appeal to women. But occasionally he has shown flashes of talent (such as SEVEN MONKEYS), and he does again in this film. The doe-eyed beauty of Claire Forlani is the perfect complement to him. While both rich and beautiful, she comes across as someone who looks for something deeper in a man than Pitt's obvious physical charms. I am surprised she has not been in other big-budget films, since this was made in 1998. With his under-appreciated charm, Jeffrey Tambor plays his usual character of the slightly dim-witted loser, and Anthony Hopkins is good as always. But this is a star vehicle for Pitt, and he is surprisingly up to the task. I had intended to watch and discard this movie, but now it is a keeper for my video library. Guys - this is a perfect date film. We should all keep a couple of ""chick flicks"" like this on hand, that appeal to women but are more thought-provoking than just their usual Titanic-level garbage."
"nikkinyberg","8","1","2","23 June 2005"," A beautiful story about a man with probably the most depressive job.
","***SPOILER WARNING***<br/><br/>Sure. The story IS quite simple. Death falls in love with a woman he cant make a bond to. But there is so much Dept in this movie. It shows us so much love you almost begin to cry. The great friend ship that evolves through time between The Media Mogul William Parrish, who death came for in the first place is so heart taking. The actors are doing great. Hopkins gets to do one of his greatest achievements and Brad Pitt makes a great performance in a very hard role. And Claire Forlani makes an outstanding job as the Love of Mr Joe Black. <br/><br/>The ending was great but i have to admit i was a little disappointed when the guy from the Cafée came back. It felt kinda unfair to death.<br/><br/>Apart from that this is a beautiful movie which is, at least in my thought deeply underrated.<br/><br/>I loved it."
"Sonetto","9","1","2","19 June 2005"," A better movie than I originally thought...
","I didn't particularly care for this movie when I first watched it, but on viewing it a second time I had a different judgment. This is a movie that has its own pace, a little slow at times, and the viewer must adjust to it. Once you're attuned to it, the movie has a charm and a poignancy that makes it possible then to see that it's about the transcendency of love over death. When ""Death"" comes to earth in the form of Joe Black to find out what it's like to be mortal, he learns that love trumps ""Death,"" though not in quite the way one would expect. It's a fantasy based loosely on ""Death Takes a Holiday,"" a 1934 film directed by Mitchell Leisen. The luminous presence of Claire Forlani as Susan lends beauty and a moving piquancy to the scenes between her and Brad Pitt as Joe Black. When one sees Susan and Joe Black together, one wants the scene to last ""forever."" Anthony Hopkins is as usual excellent, though it seems by now that he could almost, to use a cliché, phone in his performance. Brad Pitt is studiedly thoughtful, and one can almost see the wheels turning in his head as he portrays Joe Black.<br/><br/>It's a long film that could have been a little shorter without sacrificing the mood or the plot. The music, by Thomas Newman, is a perfect complement to the movie, though once or twice I thought it a little loud and thus intrusive.<br/><br/>Forget what the professional critics have said. See this movie, but be prepared to let it sink in."
"anne-freaks","9","1","2","4 June 2005"," Whisper of a thrill
","It's kinda hard to write about this movie. It's one of the most popular romantic movies, and I'm not surprised at this fact. As I experienced it's really enjoyable though sometimes it's a little confusing. Maybe because of the 2 main topic: death and love. Brad Pitt or rather: Death went on a holiday to find out ""mortal coil"", and he asked William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) to be his travel guide before he takes him to the other world. The only problem is that in the meantime Death falls in love with William Parrish's daughter: Susan. (Claire Forlani)<br/><br/>This is really an unique movie. (Funny but still sentimental.) Not just because of the unique story, but because of the unique actors, and music. Thomas Newman did his best again. Just like in Pay if forward for example. <br/><br/>Sometimes you will find this movie a bit worn-out and trivial, but it still worth watching at least once. So if you are in the mood and you're alone, just get yourself a glass of wine and meet Joe Black."

","So many people have left excellent comments here on the movie, that I'll encourage you to look to them for more insights. I just wanted to add that I thought that Jeffrey Tambor gave a great performance as the weak-willed, but good-intentioned, son-in-law Quincy. You gotta love the guy, especially his loyalty to his wife and her father. I love the scene where Joe Black puts his hand on Quincy's bald head to console him in a moment of anguished guilt. Of course, the leads did a great job, but it's also nice to see supporting characters fleshed out in such human depth.<br/><br/>And don't worry about the three hours - they're well spent."

","This film begins with big Hollywood (hollow wood) glamour, and perhaps more than a bit uncertain in its characters. But it warms up -- gradually but surely with each scene -- into a movie to fall in love with. One falls in love with the boundless freedom and power of these characters' lives. One falls in love with Claire Forlani, as always. And one falls in love with the performances of Hopkins and Pitt, as always.<br/><br/>But what is it about, this film? We must recognize its devices. Forlani's character is engaged to marry the wrong man. Hopkins' character is very rich. Death enters their lives with a profound and sincere interest in Susan (Forlani).<br/><br/>There's no reason to presume that Pitt's character, immortal Death, has never been in a human body before or has never been in love before. Perhaps the last time was three hundred or three thousand years ago. We only know it was not recent -- it's uncommon to him. We know (presumably) that if he has taken on the mortal coil before, it could not have been in the life he chose this time. We know that love is -- this time, or always -- new to him. What can we know about the existence of the character Death? We know that the immortal played by Mr Pitt covets the mortal embrace of life, of Susan Parrish.<br/><br/>The film reminds us how life can be lived, and another loved, to make immortals jealous of our mortality."
"doughill12","9","1","2","23 February 2005"," To Clear things up
","People have wondered why the original character came back at the end. In my opinion, he was allowed to come back because Joe Black was in love with Susan, and because he wanted to see her happy. He would do anything to have her be happy, because he realized what love means, to be able to let someone go to be happy. Remember, he is death and could choose who he wants to take and when. So, he allowed the original character to come back to make sure that Susan would always be happy. And Joe Black probably figured that Susan originally fell in love with the first character. And also, I do think the original character would have some knowledge of what happened when he was ""dead."""

I would love to know him better since he is always best when he plays the man he surely must be, 3 hours is long but I remained completely engrossed. I will watch it again with relish because there is much to savor as far as I am concerned.<br/><br/>The necessary personal confrontations - hard and soft - are well filmed but Brad's first love encounter does a great job of capturing innocence satisfied.<br/><br/>I have had fairly little concern for Brad before but now find him worthy of watching more."
"spudnutsncoffee","10","1","2","10 February 2005"," An almost perfect film...and a must see.
","I am not one for romantic movies, but Meet Joe Black is a romantic film that brings tears to my eyes every time I see it. Not only does this film tenderly touch on the wonderment and grandeur of first love, but it tackles other such weighty issues as nobility in the face of treachery, grace under pressure, the importance of honor in keeping ones word when to go back on ones word would be far easier and of course the courage of coming to grips with ones own mortality. Ultimately, Meet Joe Black it is a film about what is best in humanity; what it means to be human.<br/><br/>I will not go into the plot of the film, but I do want to address the main review of this film listed above. I think the reviewer is missing the point of the film when he criticizes the writing and the casting of Brad Pitt in the main role.<br/><br/>First of all, the writing was excellent. Second, it was important for the character of Joe Black to be young for the story to work on all levels. Joe Black needed a mentor. Anthony Hopkins could not have mentored someone his own age. Moreover, Joe needed to fall in love for the first time, and it would have been less believable, and perhaps less palatable, for a man of Al Pacino's age to convey the angst of first love with any semblance of innocence. Claire Falani's character needed her suitor (Joe) to be young so that the romance could be seen as fresh and new, and so that the character of Bill Parrish could see Joe Black as a young man falling in love with his daughter. Brad Pitt's performance was elegant and perfect. His youth, contrasted with Hopkins elegance, makes the relationship between the two characters all the more peculiar and interesting to the other characters in the film, who are on the outside looking in.<br/><br/>The ending requires the viewer to fill in a few gaps somewhat, but if you can do that you will be hard pressed to find a more visually stunning and beautifully told story."

I enjoyed every aspect of Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Bill Parrish and found it refreshing to watch a movie that celebrated a highly successful man whose character could not be compromised. A man who maintained love for his family, life work, and life itself with passion and dignity. I felt Brad Pitt's interpretation of death was delightful from the humorous to the darker sides.

Personally I don't have any problems with the subject, nor with the actors playing in it. I thought that Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins were a very good match.

Jeffrey Tambor plays a great character and Marcia gay harden is also an enjoyable character. Claire Forlani is super and very sexy.

","Surprisingly, Meet Joe black left me feeling good. I say ""surprisingly"" because I knew the polt line which sounded very gloomy and I had some initial concerns about watching it. Although I did not get to see it from start to finish(came in after it started) I watched it through to end and found myself charmed and touched at this unusual movie.<br/><br/>Oh of coarse I cried to-that's inevitable when watching a movie like this. But the gloom and doom that can proceed this type of movie (for instance I walked out of ""City of angels"") just wasn't here and I enjoyed Meet Joe Black. It was fun to see Pitt in this kind of role and contrary to what I've heard many say, I thought he and Claire Forlini had oodles of chemistry-more then Pitt had with almost any actress I've seen him on screen with.<br/><br/>The movie is very much a downer in some places and the ending was both sad and beautiful but It is worth watching though I wouldn't rank it as one of my faves.

","I just saw this movie and am wondering why I waited so long to see this wonderful film. The songs and the acting took me to places that few moveis ever have. Brad Pitt does a wonderful job as 'Death', giving the character depth and feeling. He is all at once naive, sweet, bold and daring. You actually believe that death does not have any experience with interacting with people and yet understands love at the end of the movie better than any other entity. Sir Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as the man that challenges death while realizing that he is on borrowed time. The way he acts between protecting his daughter and teaching death about life in just a short period of time was the best acting I have seen Sir Hopkins give since Silence of the Lambs. Definitely a must see for the hopeful romantics of the universe!!!"

","I watched this movie for the fifth time last night. There is something about it that I connect with. I really like this movie and highly recommend it. Here are some of the reasons: I have three daughters. In the movie, William Parrish (Hopkins) simply adores his daughters. He gives them wonderful advice that is worthy of quoting. (I have). He is extremely successful it motivates me every time I see the movie. There is an incredible mystery about death that is intriguing. Nobody really knows what is on the other side of that threshold. The movie makes one examine his mortality. It gives meaning to family, character and relationships. The music is incredible. I have the soundtrack and it is a must have. On a lighter note, there are several plots that keep things interesting. Watch the movie and look for the pearls. They are there if you can find them. You never know, lightning could strike."

","One has to admire dogged admiration of an established tradition for its own sake, however misguided or foolish it may be. Rather like our national penchant for elevating family scions and movie actors to be heads of state, Hollywood chooses to produce its own brand of Stepford Husbands and foist them off on sentimental audiences until the last possible dollar can be wrung out at the box office.<br/><br/>In the tradition of aging Kewpie dolls like Ryan O'Neal, Warren Beatty, and Robert Redford, we now have Brad Pitt joining the parade. As Dorothy Parker might have said of him, he displays the full range of thespian emotion from A to B. I think he probably got as far as ""bewilderment"" in this dismal and tedious remake. It must have been a painful job for the hairdresser to keep his golden hair strands properly mussed from scene to scene, given that everything else about him suggests wooden immobility.<br/><br/>Beautiful as the sets and costumes are, and with at least some of the cast able to generate a spark or two, this lifeless attempt to find profundity in cheap sentiment is not worth a second glance.<br/><br/>And, in order not to beg the question, I admit that I watched it only as a way to fill some time waiting for the postman to arrive with my social security check.

Nothing was left to chance and the result was a feeling of floating through it much like death must have felt taking the role of a human. <br/><br/>Marcia Gay Harding had a couple of scenes and the standout speech she gives to her father of why he need not concern himself that she was not the favorite was such a valuable lesson that the entire movie was worth the trouble just for that.

I don't think I can watch this movie without sobbing for joy/sadness; just the emotion or tangle of to express life and death.<br/><br/>What better way to show power than to be quietly confident not questioning your own thoughts or words the way Death must speak.

","""Meet Joe Black"" is one of those films that will make you smile from start to finish. With talented stars, a script rich in plot and characters, ""Meet Joe Black"" is a movie to watch. <br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" is a remake of an earlier film called ""Death Takes A Holiday."" In ""Meet Joe Black"" death takes human form as he comes to see the world, with the assistance of the body he is going to take. Anthony Hopkins adds his superstar status as the fiesty father, which he plays so convincingly.<br/><br/>There is only one result that can come from inserting two of the most talented actors in a film that has great writing. Hopkins stars alongside Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani in one of the most romantic, intelligent and character driven movies I have seen in a long time. Excitement and pleasure were two feelings that made my heart skip a beat. <br/><br/>When I heard Hopkins would be a part of the film, I immediately thought the amount of credibility he would give toward ""Meet Joe Black."" Hopkins is the type of actor like Robert De Niro and Morgan Freeman whose mere presence on film will alert the viewer that they will be watching a great film. Hopkins brought integrity, intelligence, and honesty to this role.<br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" is truly a movie filled with romance, excitement, joy, happiness, and sorrow. Brad Pitt's approach was enjoyable to watch as he seemed to pull it off with innocence. It was like he is learning everything from scratch, though he may know more than he is letting on. Also, Pitt's performance is like a mirror image to that of Hopkins.<br/><br/>Forlani is a vision to behold in ""Meet Joe Black"" as her beauty radiates off the screen with such heat. Forlani showcases her true ability to capture the essence of her character and portray it with innocence and sincerity. Audiences will enjoy the surprises Forlani has in store for them.<br/><br/>I give ""Meet Joe Black"" 4 enthusiastic stars."

Even though Brad Pitt plays the character of 'Death' you feel that you can really relate to him, which is a sure sign from an actor.

","I read in a previous review on this site Brad Pitt's performance described as 'stiff'.  That strikes me as a misinterpretation.  Brad Pitt plays Death, taking on a body to find out what he's been missing, to discover what life and love are like.  I found Mr. Pitt's interpretation, a challenge for any actor, one would think, poignant and even delightful.  He seems uncomfortable and uncertain in this body, like someone who has never worn one before, while at the same time he is enjoying the experience and the new discoveries he's making, such as...peanut butter.  But even with the uncertainties, there is an underlying sense of power whenever he is brought back to himself.  And a wonderful poignancy as he discovers the wonders and heartbreaks of life and love.<br/><br/>The movie moves rather slowly at times, but it seemed to me to build throughout, and the ending is that much more powerful.<br/><br/>A delightful movie.

THREE HOURS ... puh, well, a Harry Potter would have needed that amount of time, but for MJB it was way to much time and gave it a ""slow"" feeling.<br/><br/>But it wasn't entirely bad. Although the story is not new (personally, I like the Death in Sandman by Neil Gaiman much better, and she is only mortal for a day  every hundred years) the setting was quite nice. A media mogul with an accomplished  life as a guide for death? Why not. The whole setting reminded me of the books of Robert A. Heinlein, where an old but wise man is often the guide for a younger and inexperienced person, hmmm, like a mixture of ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" and ""I Will Fear No Evil"". Regarding the need for guidance ... maybe death does not know what it is to live, but with the knowledge he has about other areas a normal dinner should be no problem for him - but perhaps it's the difference between seeing it done and experiencing it first hand.<br/><br/>All in all the movie was a slow, nice distraction with a Brad Pitt for the female audience and a very attractive Claire Forlani for the male. There are better movies about death, like ""My Life Without Me"" for example and much better comics, like the mentioned Sandman-Comics by Neil Gaiman (""Death: The High Cost of Living"" for example or the Chapter ""The Sound of Her Wings"" in a Sandman-Edition). Both are way superior to this movie (sorry, Forlani).<br/><br/>But it was o.k. for a slow evening (and the beginning of the night).<br/><br/>4/10"

A life without the ultimate burden of fear could be reached for the willingness to believe the unbelievable.

"fetreis","9","1","2","10 March 2004"," a little spoiler here
","First off i think it is important to realize that this movie will either be loved or not cared for.  One other user had recoginized this before me and i think its important to note.  With that said only a true romantic can really enjoy this film, simply because there is much that goes into it which many reviews dont seem to understand.<br/><br/>Hopkins is fantastic as always, his character really surprised me in a lot ways, there is such a genuiness to the big media figure that Hopkins portrays.  It adds such a charm to his character and something the audienc e can cleary relate to.  You can clearly see Hopkin's character change throughout the film in subtle ways as he learns to accept his fate.  For my money with the exception of Pacino, there is nobody better in hollywood at raising his voice for effect.  Hopkin's character will really grow on the audience as the feeling for him turns from pity to respect.<br/><br/>Pitt has received a lot of undue crap for his portrayl of death.  Death is not supposed to be charming, sweet, or dashing.  I think some of the users want to keep Pitt in that natural charm that he exudes.  But for the sake of the film he has to lose that, which he even admitted was hard to do.  The more i watch the film the more Pitt's character really shows growth as well. Death in a way humanizes which is shown in the end as he tears up.  His character is never the same after making love with Susan and the audience can really feel this.  Pitt does a very good job in this role, but due to the narrow mindedness of many of the users and critics the appretiation for his talent goes by the way-side.  In a way Death's innocence to the world he has never experienced is very charming and adds more depth to the film.<br/><br/>Forlani is very well cast as Susan and portrays a certain naive innocence which suits the role.  Her beauty is very charming without being over the top, and her gentle personality work well to soften the persona of Death. This was by far her best role in a young career and i think very telling of how a good script can really make a chracter.  The scenes with death and Susan have a very awkward clumsiness which fits well with how Pitt is supposed to play the charcter.  Death in a way adapts the nature of the young man that Susan met and is very much vulnerable in the end of the movie.  This of course is caused by Forlani's inspired acting and wonderful adaptiation the scrpit and audience.<br/><br/>Quince and Drew also add an extra spice to the pot as they play off one another for the affection of Bill.  Drew's charcter stays firm throughtout movie and creates a villian that the audience loves to hate, cinematically ideal.  While Quince plays that warm impressionable soul who struggles to find his nitche.  Alison also adds a torn element as the first born daughter.  Her character plays well of off Susan and the scene towards the end with Bill is priceless.  Its a movie that tells a family tale in this mist of the main plot.<br/><br/>In conclusion the film was for me very captivating and holds a special place in my heart.  My father and I are both very sentimental and love watching it together when im home from school.  It just has that element to it which can be loved in a way many films cannot be these days.  Certainly not a perfect film but i would rate it 8/10.  Lastly many have crabbed about the time length.  But for those romantically inclined souls Bill Parrish sums it up great when he says it all went by so fast.  It starts with Pitts charm and ends with such.  In between is a film of cinematic charm and deep thought."

For me, the questions start with Pitt.  <br/><br/>Why did he take on that dull persona I wonder?  Why did he insist on playing death like a dolt?  Also, why did he have that high lighted sunshine-puff-puff doo?  <br/><br/>He injured the movie with blank looks and a lifeless stupidity, while giving his love interest (played by the delicious Claire Forlani) absolutely no reason to desire him.    <br/><br/>Director Martin Brest (who suffered immensely at the hands of GIGLI) should have known that his lead actor would be box office poison.  As kind as genetics have been to Pitt, they have not endowed him the ability to portray the surreal.  Therefore, I would have suggested Jim ""The Jesus"" Caviezal for the coveted part of Joseph Black.  In addition, I would have held back on the whispering voice overs that appeared more like severe editing errors than the magical messages they were intended to be.  In addition, I might have rewritten the script, told Hopkins that Don Sutherland was getting the father role, and asked Claire Forlani to marry me.

During the whole [looooong] 3 hours, I was waiting for the movie to really start. When a movie is built on a premise as profound and abstract as the personification of death, one would expect it to have an equally profound and abstract message at the end, but in my opinion ""Meet Joe Black"" fails. The message about love is the same as every other movie (""these things have a way of working themselves out""), and the message about life is basically to live and die without regrets. Wow. Amazing. *insert sarcasm* I also had a hard time buying Death's love for Susan...her own feelings are understandable, as she thinks she's looking at the same man she met in the coffee shop, but he hardly knows anything about her or even spends any time with her, and the next thing we know, they're having sex.<br/><br/>So basically, if you like long, dramatic but pointless movies, then you'll love ""Meet Joe Black.""

This time the role goes to Brad Pitt, and the sole twist is...he's not an ordinary angel, he is The Angel of Death.  Pitt enters Anthony Hopkins' life not to bring divine wisdom and help, but to end Hopkins' human existence.  This concept has potential, but the theme of ""death as a blessing"" or ""death as transition to another reality"" was barely touched on.  (More on this below).<br/><br/>Many good elements here -- fine actors, FABULOUS music, top cinematography, solid direction.  The basic story idea -- about mortality adding extra spice to life and poignancy to love -- comprises a profound and timeless theme.<br/><br/>3 hour length in and of itself is no problem (nobody complains that Lawrence of Arabia is too long).  The real problem is, an even stronger emotional payoff and greater romantic thrill could have been achieved with tighter writing and brisker pacing.  Many repetitive scenes and speeches should have been trimmed or cut entirely.<br/><br/>Example:  check out the key thematic scene with the father and daughter in the helicopter, where Hopkins tells her to seek ""lightning"" in her life. Hopkins is made to repeat his 1-minute speech 3 different times with only slight variations!  The sibling rivalry subplot could have been axed; nobody would have missed it...etc.<br/><br/>Pitt's role as an otherworldly spirit who is awkwardly learning to be human led him to choose an odd acting style.  Some like it, others loathe it. My problem is not Pitt's acting, but the way the role is written:  Death is virtually omniscient about some things including minutiae of human experience (this is perfectly believable for an immortal, godlike being), yet at the same time Death is ignorant and wide-eyed innocent as a newborn babe about other very simple and universal human experiences (this is not credible and was mined for very weak humor).<br/><br/>In this movie, as in most others featuring the Hollywood cliche about ""angels who long to be human,"" the filmmakers reveal a certain poverty of imagination...regrettable in a fantasy, where imagination should be given full play.  There is a consistent failure in these films to even consider, much less appreciate, the possibility that a transcendent, metaphysical, purely spiritual existence could be MORE satisfying (and more exciting and more full of love) than a physical, human life based on the senses.<br/><br/>Such a premise would not ruin the drama but would heighten it.  For example, Meet Joe Black would have worked better if Death were somehow FORCED to be human for a while, hated it, and saw himself as the Great Liberator who was freeing humanity to transition to a higher, better existence.  (In this film Death seems to regard himself as a sort of cosmic elevator attendant:  his job is necessary but morally neutral.)  Death might then progress from mere intellectual omniscience about every aspect of human existence, to an emotional appreciation that even the meager perceptions and intellects of human beings are capable of love and nobility.  (Meet Joe Black came about halfway toward  achieving this, but didn't quite make it.)<br/><br/>All the humans who meet Death should see him as a fearful, terrifying scourge.  As the film was actually produced, only one character had that reaction (the Jamaican lady in the hospital, and she quickly got over her fear).  The other characters in MJB who realized his true identity responded as if Death, in performing his basic function, was the school principal announcing that, regrettably, recess time is over.<br/><br/>In sum: portraying the angel character as one who strongly preferred his otherworldly existence would have sharpened conflicts, deepened the characters' motivations, and eliminated many inconsistencies.  It would have invested the Death vs. Hopkins conflict with greater stakes, and made the love story even more poignant.<br/><br/>(By the way:  if you personally met the Angel of Death, don't you think you would ask even ONE question about the nature of the afterlife?  Even if he refused to answer, somebody in this movie should have asked!)"

","semi spoilers...<br/><br/>The only problems with this film were: <br/><br/>(1) the rushed Nora Ephron style ending (there should have been a week before the 'reunion' took place)<br/><br/>(2) the weird acting of the female lead, who appeared to have attended the Renee Zellweger acting school, whose main prop is a huge bowl of lemons which have to be eaten whole prior to every scene.

"meitschi","Null","1","2","10 June 2003"," Flawed, but with some great moments
","I agree with commenter mccracd (11 April 2003) on most points, except that I found that Brad Pitt was really good in his role. And - independently of this - am not a fan of his, but his extreme good looks were a real treat for the eye. Though the casting of such an extremely handsome man as Death who wants to take a 65-old straight man with him left me wondering: why did Death waste all these good looks on such a ""victim"" (he didn't plan to fall in love with Susan Parrish straight from the start, after all)? If the two men themselves had had a love story with each other, it would have been different of course, but in this case, I agree with commenter mccracd that another, older and less handsome-looking actor would have been more aptly cast. Also Death's lack of knowledge on human ways seemed misplaced in a story on such a serious topic and reminded me of cheap comedy fare that was completely unnecessary here.I also think the script on the whole was flawed (it did not really know where to go and wanted too much, I think) and much of the dialog lacked punch and intelligence. Some memorable dialog bits could have made a cult movie of this one.<br/><br/>The story was compelling though in a weird way and made me think a lot (about my own mortality, among other things). Formally, the movie was really beautifully made (great photography! - watch the scene where Hopkins and Pitt meet for the first time) and for me at least, it did not seem to drag.<br/><br/>What was a really supreme moment in the film was the lovemaking scene between Susan and Joe. You don't find very often a mainstream Hollywood film where lovemaking really MEANS something (in case they do include such a scene in the movie), but here, it was the peak of Death's experience as a living person. Look at Brad Pitt's face here: what mixture of astonishment, awe, love, lust, fear...! Just plain wonderful. Death engaging in the ultimate act of Life.<br/><br/>As for the tears in the last few scenes: Claire Forlani's weeping all the time didn't move me at all - but when Death sheds a tear, it did....<br/><br/>I'd give it 6/10."

","My first review of this film was way to plain and short because i was short on time so here is my second stab at it. This was an excellant film. It was unique and well thought out. The idea of making a deal with death was well above the screenplays we see today. Although it could have been cut down. It has some clever lines, but some scenes are too long to keep your whole attention. Anthony Hopkins is extrodinary as usual, and Brad Pitt kept up his end of the deal. The best part in this whole film is the witty and clever scene with Bill, Joe, and Drew. I recommend this film for people who appreciate film making and want another piece to critique."

","There are things about this movie that fascinate me. Anthony Hopkins once again shows his mastery of the craft. The only sad part is that I could see and feel others in the cast trying to come up to the level of Hopkins. Normally, this would have been helped by proper editing. Here it is amplified, especially in the case of Brad Pitt ... not a knock of Pitt, just the way his part came off in this movie. For me, the Jamaican accent came off a bit forced. Forlani came off well. I disagree with some who said her part did not have enough dialogue. Here, it would have made her character seem sappy. I will watch this movie again. Hopkins is just too good ... Today's Alec Guinness or Spencer Tracy."

","One thing that bothered me greatly was that this man, who professed that he wanted this ""passion"" for his beautiful, younger daughter, a passion that he had for her, and his deceased wife, he did NOT have for his older, dutiful and much less attractive daughter.  It's understood that his eyes did not light up for the more homely one when she walked in the room, as they do for the beautiful one.  The fact that Death is personified in the form of one of the world's most beautiful men (Pitt) also makes the idea of this ""passionate, honest love"" seem to be tied much too much to physical beauty. And, the fact that the ""man"" she finally falls for is not a man at all makes the picture equally uninspiring. And the level at which this love seems held, seems simply unrealistic.  As she walks off with the real Joe Black at the end, what is she going to do when he first shows signs of being a normal man?  So, how are we mere mortals to feel about ourselves after seeing this movie?"
"allanm051","Null","1","2","15 December 2002"," Too long by about an hour
","I don't know what movie the others were watching, by this one really bugged me. Of course, I was watching it on TV, so the experience was a little different, but I found myself wondering when it was going to end. The dialog was alternately pretentious and trite. In his wonderful Disk World series of novels, Terry Pratchett has Death speak IN ALL CAPS, LIKE THIS. The script of this movie sounds as if it were written in all caps, with long pauses so we can all absorb its IMPORTANCE. Also, the adulation the author gives to the tycoon played by Anthony Hopkins irritated me. I've never met a CEO who everyone liked, although they probably pretended they did. Most of them are dreadful beasts. This is ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for the upper crust. Of course, it's a wonderful life, you dummy, you're rich! The choice of music in the final party sequence, which seemed to run in real time, was hokey in the extreme, though I guess most of the audience wouldn't recognize ""Our Love is Here to Stay"", ""Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails"", or even (this one is really abused) ""It's a Wonderful World"", all used to comment on the cheesy dialog."
"lora8407","Null","1","2","15 November 2002"," Almost good
","***Contains some spoilers***<br/><br/>The worst thing about Meet Joe Black is the pacing. It makes Merchant/Ivory look like Michael Bay. Sadly, when you watch it you see how good this could have been were the script better and the movie an hour shorter. As it is, the plot is completely implausible--and not in a whimsical, willing-suspension-of-disbelief kind of way--and pointless. We never know exactly why Death wants to visit, the plot is full of holes, you don't care about any of the characters, and an hour could have been cut from the movie with the elimination of constant ""meaningful"" glances and silences. It was just barely interesting enough to keep me tuned for three hours. <br/><br/>Brad Pitt is almost good--you can see what he was shooting for in his portrayal (and a round of applause for the valiant attempt at a Jamaican accent.) The astoundingly beautiful Claire Forlani isn't given much to do except be astoundingly beautiful, which she does well enough (and, since I believe she's English, another round of applause for her perfect American accent.) Marcia Gay Harden and particularly Jeffrey Tambor are very good as the unfavored daughter and her well-meaning shlub husband.  Anthony Hopkins is also good enough, but an actor of his caliber shouldn't be in a movie this mediocre. Oh well. (It also sounds like he did the voice-overs when Death is whispering to  his character; hence the effect is less Prince of Darkness than Hannibal Lecter, Ghost Of Oscars Past.)<br/><br/>Anyway, only rent this if you're extremely bored, suffering from  acute insomnia, and are a die-hard Brad Pitt fan. The rest of us wasted three hours of our lives."

A lot of movies that are this long tend to have boring and unnecessary parts, but in Meet Joe Black, I didn't find this the case.  Hopkins was great, Pitt was fairly good, and even Claire Forlani (I think that's her name) was good (much better than in Antitrust).<br/><br/>There were a couple of scenes that were a bit drawn out, but overall, the positives outweigh the negatives.  The movie has many emotional scenes, and some are also quite funny (Pitt speaking in the caribbean accent was pretty cool).  The fact that the director pulled off a a good movie, involving a love story, and Death in human form (how ironic is that?) surprised me. 8/10"

His lines want to crackle with enunciation and spice.  <br/><br/>But Pitt has always talked like he has a mouth full of marbles.  Here he sounds like he is reading a line, instead of talking, because someone who speaks that way wouldn't choose words unnatural to his cadence of speech.<br/><br/>This isn't to put Pitt down.  It's just to say that he was not a good choice for this particular role."

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","1","2","4 January 2002"," Enjoyable and done well
","""Meet Joe Black"" tales the story of how Death fell in love... Well I'd give it marks for an original premise (if it wasn't a re-make). I have never seen the original so I can comment only on this.<br/><br/>In it's favour: A fine performance by Anthony Hopkins as William Parrish, a man who is forced to humour Death's ""holiday"" in return for a few more days on Earth. The directing is generally finely handled by Martin Brest as it is able to observe the grandoise life Parrish has built up for him and yet also convey some of the intimacy that develops between Brad Pitt's character of Joe Black and Claire Forlani's Susan Parrish. He also manages to keep the tale evenly paced so there is no sense of any scene being rushed to force it to a climax (though this will detract some people from the movie). The score is - for the large part - nicely observed and complements the scene at hand.<br/><br/>Against it: Brad Pitt generally gives a fine performance as the eponymous Joe Black but at times it's hard to see the passion of love in him. While the musical score was generally good it most certainly grated at the end of the movie falling prey to Hollywood's incessant need to constantly swell the music to match some climatic event. And of course there's the arguable length of the movie - the movie doesn't drag and I was never bored by it but, at the same time, it might have benefited by some pruning in certain areas. <br/><br/>Overall it's a good movie. It's no classic and the ending to the movie is no surprise (though it's not meant to be particularly). It's leisurely and does not rush itself. Ultimately forgettable and a piece of well done visual candy but there's nothing wrong with that. One to catch if you can."

","Meet Joe Black had a lot of potential.  Unfortunately, it failed one of the most important tests of filmmaking:  the length test.  It was much too long to keep me entertained.<br/><br/>When I went to see this movie, I had no idea what is was about.  For all the trouble I went through while watching the film, I'm still glad I saw it.  I liked the message it presented.  It was new, and it was presented in a rather unique way.  Sir Anthony Hopkins, as usual, performed tremendously. I saw this as a rather unusual role for him (at least from the films I've seen).  He lights up the screen every time he appears in this movie.  Brad Pitt also gave a good performance.  He has real acting potential if he settles down a little bit (Check out Fight Club and Snatch.). Cinematography was well done.  It added a subtlety to the film that I thought was necessary.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film was too drawn out.  The love scene should have been a minute long...not 15 minutes long.  It became unnerving after a while. The scene of the accident was just ridiculous.  It completely halted the mode/tone of the film.  It made me realize that we were watching a movie...bad move.  There were moments of lengthened silence and dialogue that were also not needed.  The film should have been 2 hours long...not 3 hours.<br/><br/>The ending was fitting but much too melodramatic (and drawn out).  That's why I consider the music to also be a weakness in this film.  It added to the melodrama, which there already was enough of.<br/><br/>In short, the movie shows potential and has many memorable scenes (The first meeting between Pitt and Hopkins in particular is quite good.).

"karma-20","Null","1","2","2 January 2001"," I think I'm being mean in this review, but not as mean as I could make it to be.
","I had heard the hype and I had heard the criticisms. So I thought that I may as well watch it to judge for myself.<br/><br/>You know, this really could have been an incredily interesting film. It isn't though because I guess it had box office obligations to fulfil. (Come on, Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins don't come cheap!) I respect that. Ok, so it's going to be a bit cliche ridden and a bit sappy, as long as there was a reasonably good storyline, I could live with it...not the case here.<br/><br/>This film had an unbelievable premise (no pun intended). I mean, here was director Martin Brest who made the wonderful film Scent of a Woman, Anthony Hopkins who was just magic as Hannibal Lector and Brad Pitt whose only praise I can conjure is his terrific performance in 12 monkeys and his near cameo appearance in Thelma and Louise. There was so much talent yet somehow, they didn't contribute to the desired effect.<br/><br/>First off, most of the dialogue is in ultra hush hush tones. Not for the hearing challenged. And if you can get past the volume, there's a clarity problem. Pitt just doesn't seem to talk much and when he does, it's undecipherable mumble.<br/><br/>Secondly, death taking on human form. If death is the undeniable force Brad Pitt earlier claims to Anthony Hopkins, he certainly dumbs down to meet the real world. There was so much conviction of his own importance that I find it improbable that 'Death' could be so naive. And if 'Death' is so easily led to falling in love, certainly he would feel the sorrow of the world, the ordinary sufferings of humans which we have taken for granted and he would have been affected by these thoughts as well. In the true style of Hollywood, 'Death' manifested into humanity sees and experiences the good but not the bad.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the sick Jamaican woman. After adopting the accent, I didn't recognise that Pitt was trying to sympathise with the woman. I thought he was mocking the way she spoke. Anyhow, it was terrible to the nth degree.<br/><br/>Fourthly, Oh my GOD did it DRAG!! Three hours which could easily have been cut down to two if they'd cut down on some of those pseudo-important, sentimental or romantic close ups which achieve nothing except that they are pretty faces to look at. It gave the effect of looking at pictures of the actors in a tabloid magazine. They were just so frozen and lifeless.<br/><br/>Fifthly: maybe I wasn't paying attention by that stage but I thought that the ending wasn't very coherent. It was never made clear the nature of Anthony Hopkins' ending and what would happen afterwards. Also, this film's ending focuses on Pitt and Forlani and seems to forget that someone has died...? (a fate suffered also by the film Return to Paradise). And if you think about it, why would Joe Black be in the coffee house to begin with?<br/><br/>and lastly. Death which apparently knows the workings of the universe doesn't knock on your door everyday. So why wasn't Anthony Hopkins' character a bit more opportunistic and asked him to reveal some of that knowledge? I certainly would.<br/><br/>I thoroughly didn't like this film but at least I watched it to the end to be fair and so I could give a valid review of it (kinder than a lot of people who just give an opinion even though they've only seen half of it). So watch it, and have a good laugh with me."
"otter","Null","1","2","1 January 2001"," Brad Pitt strikes again!
","Brad Pitt kills this movie. The movie is slow, it's long, it's almost silent, but those aren't necessarily movie-killers. No, to really kill a movie, you have to get the leading role completely, utterly wrong - like here.<br/><br/>It's basically a remake of the old movie ""Death Takes a Holiday"", where Death assumes human form, and falls in love. The old movie was from the early days of sound and consequently clumsily made, but had a gothic romanticism that makes it still worth watching. The new version tries for a bit of the same, and came close in some places, but you can't do Gothic Romanticism with a blank like Brad Pitt at the center of the film. It could have been a good film with a decent leading actor, the director had the courage to try for the kind of stillness and quiet that makes the smallest nuances seem vital (a la ""The Innocents"" or ""The Sixth Sense""), and for stretches of the film it actually works. It does get you to actually get into the relationships between the characters, the silence really does draw you in - when it works.<br/><br/>But some actors can't stand that kind of scrutiny - Brad Pitt being one. Death was written as having a mix of utter innocence (new to humanity and all that) and terrible depths - which HAD to be played by an actor who's at least capable of registering feeling in a close-up! For this movie to work at all the endless close-ups needed to be fascinating - we needed to watch the thoughts, feelings, and depths playing through Death's eyes. But neither thoughts, feelings, nor depths play through Pitt's eyes, nothing plays through Pitt's eyes, except a vague awareness that he looks good. All the close-ups of Brad looking clueless (the closest he can come to innocent) do not fascinate, instead he looks deeply stupid!<br/><br/>If you want to see a good movie with Death as a character don't see this, see ""The Seventh Seal"" or the original ""Death Takes a Holiday"" or Woody Allen's ""Love and Death""... or even ""Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey"" Â– which is a way better movie than this."
"centropolis","10","1","2","19 December 2000"," looks great.
","Well, hell this movie does look great. It has Dante Ferretti(Casino)'s production design, and Emmanuel Lubezki(Sleepy Hollow)'s gorgeous cinematography. But there is one problem that gets in the way of making this a good movie. Martin Brest's case of Kevin Costner-itis(The film runs for 3 hours) and it went through Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno(big mistake, writers of Radioland Murders). It should have just stayed with Kevin Wade(Working Girl) and Bo Goldman(Scent of a Woman). Another thing I would have done if I were Martin Brest is, he used two editors, His editor, Michael Tronick(Scent of a Woman) and Joe Hutshing(Jerry Maguire), to liven up the pace, I would have had the film re-chopped by the best editor on the planet, pace-jumper John Woo-editor Christian Wagner(Face/Off). The story is about Death who goes to take Anthony Hopkins, and oh, yeah, his daughter is one of the best looking things ever displayed on celluloid. So, he chills on earth, with Anthony Hopkins, and he shows him around. This movie is a great movie to look at, and considering Brad Pitt is one of my very favorite actors(I am a 15 year old male, who is heterosexual). This movie is not bad, just needs trimming. Great to look at. Rated PG-13(for thematic elements, language, and a sex-scene that will let you get a good night's sleep, trust me :-)"

","I went into this movie skeptical....then it started slow.  I didn't see a lot of promise for it, but by the end of the first hour I was completely hooked, and now I've watched this movie countless times.<br/><br/>Great performances all around....and although choosing the best is tough, I'd have to go with Anthony Hopkins.  He put on an amazing performance as Bill Parrish, a great character who is very prominent in the emotional climax of the movie.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt was amazing as Joe Black...as has been pointed out in reviews (and in the making-of featurette on the DVD), death is a fairly impossible role to prepare for, but Pitt pulled it off wonderfully.  Black is a character that definitely has to grow on you, but once it does, you'll have a great appreciation for Pitt's performance.<br/><br/>Claire Forlani did a good job in keeping up with the great cast all around her.  She pulled off Susan Parrish very well, and was believable throughout the film.  The character of Susan was one that I didn't particularly care for, but Forlani deserves credit for a very nice job.<br/><br/>This movie is just great all-around...it will invoke every emotion inside of you.  Don't let the length deter you...by the end, you'll agree that it was worth every second.  Don't let the subject of the movie deter you either....it's far more positive of a movie than you'll expect.  I give this movie a 9 out of 10, and strongly recommend it for everyone."
"bk-30","Null","1","2","19 August 1999"," Too many twists and turns
","The coffee shop scene is the only worthy scene in ""Meet Joe Black"" (from now on, MJB).  Pitt's and Forlani's characters seem genuinely interested in one another.<br/><br/>The rest is a complete failure because MJB asks too much from the audience; it makes the audience aware that this is a movie and the people they see on screen are actors trying to portray characters.  A good movie should not do this! The audience, or reader, should be so enraptured by the events and the characters that the audience feels s/he is experiencing life.  In MJF, however, there are too many gaps, too many unanswered questions, too many twists and turns.  One wonders whether Susan is in love with Death or the man in the coffee shop. One also wonders the plausibility in the character of Death.  How does Death play a role in the cosmic order, if he is a virgin to life? The happy ending in the affairs of Hopkins' character is just too much; to the attentive audience, it is obvious that these Hollywood writers are wrapping up what they have unfolded, suckering the audience without shame, without much consideration to the sensitivity of the audience: Death and Bill working together to reveal the swindle behind Susan's ex-boyfriend to the corporation, Susan meeting the guy in the coffee shop after everything is all over, among other things.<br/><br/>In an over all impression of MJB, Pitt is definitely miscast as Death (though he does a good job as the young man in the coffee shop).  Hopkins does a superb job in revealing the strength and warmth of his character. The son-in-law and the two daughters character are plausible.  Out of four stars, I give MJB one star!"
"Sisko-2","10","1","2","9 August 1999"," Excellent Movie
","This movie gives me the feeling it was one made out of love for the story and the art of making it.

I will watch this movie again and again."
"donmccon","10","1","2","4 July 1999"," Best-ever movie score
","I got to know this first as a movie score (was sent a promo of the CD), played it once as a joke, and gradually came to love it as much as any CD in my collection, even though classical is my usual area. Saw the movie (at home) with some trepidation, fearing it wouldn't measure up. As usual, much of the score is undercut by faintness or dialogue, but I really loved the movie anyway. The role of Death is so implausibly written (at some points he doesn't know his name, at others he's making up clever plots to foil the evil Drew) that nobody could play it believably. Given that, there is something godlike about Brad Pitt, and of course, Hopkins is superb as usual."
"serrae","10","1","2","30 May 1999"," If there is any film that shows the brilliance of Brad Pitt, this is it.
","This movie is so bittersweet, that it moves me every time. What gets me even more than the simpleness of this story, is the incredible performance of Brad Pitt.  Is ability to transform from an ordinary (pardon the expression)joe, to death is an amazing feat.  His ability to find joy in the little things he doesn't know as death, such as peanut butter, intrigued me to no end.  It was such an experience to watch him portray death as such an innocent, that it literally took my breath away.  Not to take away from Anthony Hopkins, who, as always, gave an amazing performance.  If you are willing to take 3 hours, and believe me, it feels like maybe 1 hour, to watch this movie, it would be worth your time.  Every moment was exquisite. A movie worth many Oscars, had it only been given a different year."
"rasputin-8","Null","1","2","25 April 1999"," A Yawner
","""Meet Joe Black"" was a drag.  It kept dragging on, not wanting to end. Think of a stubborn spike being driven into a piece of knotty oak.   The finality of this film came three and one-half hours in, in what seemed like eternity with what seemed like every out-take left in.<br/><br/>Pacing and length, towering above any apparent cinematic style, provided excellent saboteurs in making this film one of unfilled potential.   For the most part this movie was deadpan serious and a yawner save coming alive on occasion with exchanges of some clever dialogue. Yet even with this little spark, it failed to ignite MJB, for just about every single scene was excruciatingly long and tiring. It seemed as if either the editing machine broke down or the makers of the film got so enamored with their handiwork they couldn't decide what cuts to make.  The result was that everything got left in.  What probably could have worked as a shorter film - or even as a farce - was too melodramatic and hokey.  The filmmakers took the topic and indeed themselves way too seriously.  The old saying that ""the good die young,"" might aptly be restated:  ""To 'Meet Joe Black', Death came too late.""<br/><br/>Death's usurping the body of a young man to fulfill a special earthly mission while falling in love promised to be a tricky proposition to pull off.  From this standpoint of plot, the film wasn't a disappointment and did fulfill its almost self-fulfilling prophecy to come up short.    The body that was chosen for Death - Joe Black - couldn't have come in a prettier form of blood and flesh.  Brad Pitt could steal any woman's heart, I suppose, even if in this miscast role of Death he did come across as if he had been born the day before.  Wide-eyed and fresh-as-new-snow in his knowledge of life and its pleasures, he showed himself to be a fast learner, puckering up those lips for the obligatory love scene.  Seeing that Adonis physique getting hot and bothered showed that even Death can be human.  It gave the ladies in the audience and those of nontraditional sexual orientation their money's worth. It wasn't hard to imagine these raw images firing up sounds of oohs and aahs in viewers as he and Susan Parish (Claire Forlaine) cooed and cawed and grimaced and earned the movie its PG-13 rating.  From my lofty perch, however, it's hard to conceive of anything death wouldn't have known about in life, for the two go hand-in-hand. Death/Brad Pitt was ingenuously out of touch with the happenings in life, yet paradoxically possessed so much insight on other things.  In the matter of love, which is intrinsic to life, Death knew nothing about.  But he knew the skinny - all the dirt and good things, too - about the key players in the film.  It would seem that to know death (which Mr. Pitt was) is to know life.   Why then was Death clueless about female wiles while knowing so much about everything else?  Is this too philosophical?  Too picky?  Or am I the one who is taking myself too seriously instead?<br/><br/>All this wetness behind Death's ears notwithstanding, one cannot help but to get a chuckle out of the movie's second best running gag.  Death's ET-like mulling over the spoonful of peanut butter and the ways to down it did cut into the monotone of this feature-and-a-half-length picture.  Praise be to Death who did come through in the clutch stealing the show and saving the day, ultimately, by giving the wannabe corporate cut-throat his comeuppance with the best gag about nothing being certain but ""Death and Taxes"".<br/><br/>Not to take anything away from an overly serious film.  it did have its lighter moments, although few and far between long takes in which everybody spoke in low tones as if they had trouble expressing their true, innermost feelings like those at an Inner Child Within meeting or something.  When Mr. Parish (Anthony Hopkins) became infuriated, Death tried to settle him down. ""Don't have a heart attack. . .you'll ruin my vacation.""  There should have been a few more doses of comic relief like this in an all-too-serious film like Meet Joe Black.<br/><br/>Such seriousness may not be as big a culprit in the film's lack of punch as the slow pace and long length.  What could have been a well-versed screenplay turned out to be an unwitting accomplice to the movie's failure. I kept waiting for something exciting to happen.  Getting nothing is a terrible letdown.  For one thing, it took too long for the plot to begin to unfold, and when it did, it was hard to discern what it was.  Too often the dialogue was cryptic and impeded the understanding of the film.  May I use the word, ""Serlingesque""?   I just did. . .left to your interpretation.<br/><br/>I hate to rant on.  (I could be accused of being long-winded myself).  But I do have one more thing to say. . . or to ponder.  This has to do with the film's budget.  Was it on a restricted diet or did it just appear that way? This was one of the worst cases of special effects and use of extras I had ever seen.  Joe Black (before Death usurped him) hurtling through the air the way he did after getting hit could have been itself comic relief.  It looked so much like a dummy and the set looked like a sound stage. (Maybe it was a stand-in who was upgraded to stunt man).  A tight budget may have manifested by use of the extras on the board of directors, who remained mum and stoic throughout their presence on screen.  Seriously, a few words would have been called for from a few members during the cloak and dagger meeting in which the ouster of Parish was raised.  This scene called for interaction.  The cynic in me asks if these characters sat stone silent because the producer was too cheap to pay them the upgrade from extra to bit player. Though redeeming qualities in Joe Black were infrequent, there were some.  A few scenes could be preserved for a film school acting class and on screenwriting dos and don'ts.  The film did not look like it was directed by someone of Martin Brest's track record and capabilities.  Weaknesses in the movie rest squarely on his shoulders.  The actors seemed strained at times and the dialogue pulled out like hot water taffy. That's because everything was way, way too long.  The 40 minute ending had the makings of a tear-jerker, but the duration to get it over with (Parish's demise) got in the way.  (Had he made a secret deal with Death behind the scenes for ""just one more day. . .?) 20 minutes for all this would have given people time enough to cry and get it out of the system.  Instead, it gave them time to dab their eyes dry and await another emotional farewell of false endings. By the time the real ending came around, it hurt too much to cry (being so long).<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black should have been a comedy.  In a sense it was."

Also the very soap-opera-style display of the problems of the rich and famous. No actors stand out. No interesting characters. No plot worth speaking of.

","Overall I agreed with many of the reviews I have read - this film was way too long.  Maybe the directors were trying to get across some deep and meaningful thoughts which required length, but the plot and stereotypical characters ruined any effect for me.<br/><br/>William Parrish is a successful, popular, clever guy who everyone likes and so in Hollywood style, has to be about to see his life's work destroyed by some young hot-shot. Of course, he's not quite perfect, preferring his younger, intelligent and fairly pretty daughter over her sister. For me, the best character was the Jamaican woman although she only appears briefly.<br/><br/>Death taking over a human body was interesting to watch and Brad Pitt did do well in this role, giving Death the appearance of knowing language but learning to control a human body. Maybe the thought of Death being human with human emotions just unnerves me a little, but a Death which learns to be a<br/><br/>good guy whilst on earth and fall in love just doesn't seem real to me.  And if Death exists outside of time, why worry about taking Susan Parrish with him - she'll be dead herself in the blink of an eyelid?<br/><br/>Verdict:  save your 5 quid (and back from those cinema seats) and rent this on video when there's nothing on tele.  Or even save that and wait for it to be shown on TV.  This also has the advantage of the bathroom being close by!"

","Well, I met Joe Black - and I wished the encounter hadn't been<br/><br/>so long. That is not to say the film is bad, on the contrary, it<br/><br/>is (for most of its time) very entertaining. Because the<br/><br/>emotions come across as very true and the lines bring up the<br/><br/>glorious past of screwball comedies. Which, in great part, is<br/><br/>due to the perfect casting. Anthony Hopkins, impeccable as<br/><br/>always, manages to make believable the turmoil and despair of a<br/><br/>man who has just learned that he is going to die - while still<br/><br/>not giving away the jokes. Any lesser actor would have either<br/><br/>opted for broad comedy or heart-feeling tragedy. That Sir<br/><br/>Anthony walks the fine line between these two choices is one<br/><br/>more proof for his genius (and I sincerely hope he won't call it<br/><br/>quits). Much chided Brad Pitt turns in a wonderfully subtle<br/><br/>performance. One really believes that his Death is becoming more<br/><br/>human through the experience of love, but Pitt always keeps that<br/><br/>glint in his eye that reminds us of who (or what) he really is.<br/><br/>Besides that he shows a profound talent as straight comedian.<br/><br/>The only drawback is Claire Forlani who tends to ham up her part<br/><br/>as the lover a bit. But why, in death's and taxes' name, did director Brest have to<br/><br/>stretch the delicate story out over three hours? Endlessly drawn<br/><br/>out scenes of people walking senselessly about, looking at each<br/><br/>other for eternity and repeating things that had been said<br/><br/>before make one wonder why nobody told him to ""speed things up a<br/><br/>bit"" (probably James Cameron was forcing them away at gunpoint).

","The acting in this film is quite good. Sir Anthony Hopkins stars as the well-respected businessman who has been notified by an angel of death that his time is coming. Brad Pitt, made to look wooden, especially earlier in the film, is also quite good.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the film was the morbid subject matter. No matter how much you talk about something else, you know invariably what is going to occur at the film's end.<br/><br/>There is an interesting sidebar story how the associate of Hopkins, romantically involved with his daughter, who gives another excellent performance, is really undermining the boss.

","All mouths and lips are what ""Meet Joe Black"" is about, literally: pouting, peeling, teasing, nibbling, licking, slurping. Claire Forlani throws her lips around any moment she can find. Brad Pitt, nibbling soft pink peanut butter, sucks. Anthony Hopkins, a moist breeze, but not better. Marcia Gay Harden as Allison, brain death. Martin Brest, the director here, must have instructed his actors (sentimentally): ""as you well may know your lips are the most seductive part of your body and and it is very seductive when you play with your lips and and let's make a three hour film and and whisper all through the place because you don't want to wake up the audience and and whisper it all over when you hold me sweet words like I love you"". The actors when signing up for Doctor Martin Brest's lips anesthesia they must have discussed both surgical and non-surgical alternatives in lip augmentation. The director finely performed injections for who didn't want surgery these techniques result in great improvements but were a temporary solution not good for eternity. Finally, Jeffrey Tambor as Quince is the only one worth watching."

","This movie, an up-dated version of the classic film ""Death Takes A Holiday"" from the 30s, which starred Fredric March, is devoid of any real philosophical or moral qualities. It is filmed, or so it appears, purely for the entertainment value. That, in itself, is not bad, but because of the lack of true focus and insight on the part of the director, the film suffers tremendously. Here, Brad Pitt plays the part of ""Death""...but, really, at this point of time in cinematic history, no one is afraid of him. Not really. And though Pitt is an excellent actor, he is not able to pull off an authoritative performance, one that demands fear from those he encounters because of Death's cold finality, and because of the ensuing questions as to the afterlife and what one's fate could possibly be in that afterlife. I would not expect the director to give us a ""shot-by-shot"" repeat of the original...as did some unfortunate director who gave us a needless play-by-play of ""Psycho"" some years back...but there were opportunities that were missed to make this a film above the cut. And any film with Anthony Hopkins has that possibility. Talent is wasted in this one, as are opportunities to make the picture rise above the fray by mere virtue of situational possibilities that could have gone in virtually any direction...but which failed to do so. First, I feel it was a mistake to make the main character one who has lived a fairly charmed and privileged life, who does not struggle with moral and philosophical issues on a 'hand to mouth' basis daily. Where is the redemptive value in inspecting the life of someone who flies into Manhattan in his own helicopter to a private helipad, to go to his office in the midst of Wall Street to a board meeting on the top floors of some corporate structure to a meeting with his board of directors? I don't see much --if any-- redemptive value there. Second, it seems that a role reversal might have served this movie well. Brad Pitt--at this time--did not have the authoritative presence that such a terrifying spectre as death should possess. People are very much afraid of death...the fear of the unknown. But clearly, the presence of death in non-threatening form is incredible waste, and its meaning is lost on both the performers and the audience if it fails to score and make its deadly presence known and felt. This was a true failing. Hopkins could have done this, and, indeed, he has done it before...Hannibal Lector is one of the classic movie villains, and Hopkins gave Lector that life and presence. One of the missed opportunities was witnessed in the boardroom when Drew--a very arrogant character--demanded to know just who Joe Black was and why he seemed to have a strangle-hold on Hopkins' character, Bill Parrish. The way the scene was handled, without giving away the identity and purpose of Joe Black was, at that critical moment, a big letdown...almost an act of cinematic cowardice on the part of the director. It really took the steam out of the sails. Plus...that character needed to be brought down a few notches, and Death would have been the ideal one to accomplish this...but it never really happened to my satisfaction. It was one of the most dis-appointing moments of the movie, a real low. This movie had the potential to be something far more than what it wound up being. Maybe someone might try it again, and there may be something of a more fluid flow of ideas...but the writers got stuck in the mud...the direction was wooden, stoic, not multi-directional and all encompassing. Because of this, the film implodes under the weight of its own imperfections. I really wanted to like this movie..and I expected more. I cannot recommend it very highly...and I would advise a watching of the Fredric March version to get a real feel of what is going on before you tread the murky waters of ""Meet Joe Black""."

","""Death Takes a Holiday"" is revised and updated for a lovingly glamorized Brad Pitt. According to the DVD sleeve's synopsis, ""Bill Parrish (Anthony Hopkins) has it all - success, wealth, and power. Days before his 65th birthday he receives a visit from a mysterious stranger, Joe Black (Pitt), who soon reveals himself as Death. In exchange for extra time, Bill agrees to serve as Joe's earthly guide. But, will he regret his choice when Joe unexpectedly falls in love with Bill's beautiful daughter Susan (Claire Forlani)?"" <br/><br/>The picturesque Pitt (and Mr. Hopkins) will please most aficionados; but, the movie is overindulgent. Jake Weber (as Drew), Marcia Gay Harden (as Allison), and Jeffrey Tambor (as Quince) give the production fireworks some much-needed balance, with fine second tier performances; possibly, Mr. Weber offers the film's best characterization. The scenes with Pitt confabbing with a Jamaican woman in the hospital should have been sent to deleted scenes heaven; the actress, Lois Kelly-Miller, could have played a doctor who recognized Pitt as an accident victim.<br/><br/>****** Meet Joe Black (11/2/98) Martin Brest ~ Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Claire Forlani"

","I remember when this movie came out. I wanted to go and watch it in the cinema but then I missed it, and well, after 10 years I watched it on the TV. Uf, I'm happy I didn't pay to watch this!!! Why? Well... The story is full of gaps, clichés and pointless episodes. Where are these characters going? For instance, why does the girl fall in love with Brad Pitt? Because he is weird -Joe Black? Or just because he is cute -the guy at the coffee shop? She does't really seem to care... Very superficial. And why does Brad Pitt fall in love with her? That's even more mysterious. Her character is so flat, or at least the the actress make it so flat. Such bad acting, oh my! And the ex-boyfriend, the bad guy. Why does he become so bad all of a sudden? Cliché, cliché, cliché. And what about the character of the father? What is wrong with him? He admits that he prefers one daughter to the other and he's OK with it. Sweet. Why is he considered such a good father then? Anyway, this makes us conclude that the main problem with this movie is the script. Mamma mia, those lines! Terrible, boring, a lot of nonsense. No no no. I watched the movie to the end, fascinated by its low quality, curious to see what would be the next demonstration of cinematographic pathetism. Meet Joe Black? No, thanks."

","It's amazing that Brad Pitt, even at this young age, could hold his own with Anthony Hopkins. The fact that they make a great team is even more impressive.<br/><br/>While Hopkins plays a pretty standard ""60-something businessman,"" Pitt plays death itself. This film presents a more intimate view of Death's trying to understand Life than the old flick ""Death Takes a Holiday,"" so we see Death try to understand things at a very personal level. Pitt is perfect in the role, showing a charming innocence along with the necessary amount of gravitas.<br/><br/>But the picture is severely hampered by its pace, which borders on the Jurassic (the epoch, not the epic, Jurassic). If this had been edited much more tightly, we'd move briskly through a beguiling and thought-provoking story. Instead we're treated to affected dialogue (which the actors valiantly try to overcome) and tediously long takes that give us plenty of time to lose interest.<br/><br/>Kudos to Hopkins and Pitt; onions to the director."

","I've seen this movie a couple of times on television, but only bits of pieces of it. Now after finally getting a chance to see it all the way through, and at my own pace, I have to say this is a good movie. I liked all the actors performances, each of them add diligence to their characters. Even though Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt were the leads, I felt Jeffrey Tambor and Claire Forlani did the best jobs as the comical Quince and attractive Susan.<br/><br/>The story maybe a little unrealistic (since it is about the Angel of Death wanting to be a human), but it has some moral lessons, such as enjoying life to the fullest, because it is too short. Thomas Newman's score sustains much of the mood and somewhat mystical feeling to the film. But the problem with this film is the length. Three hours. Sure, there's a plot going on, but does it really need 3 hours to develop? A bit too long for my taste. 7/10"

","What happened to Martin Brest? This is a director who knew how to channel excessive actors and extract something palatable from them. <br/><br/>Here he takes on an opposite challenge: what to do with subtlety and understatement? Brest is completely lost.<br/><br/>This stuff is so thin, we get nothing more from Pitt than his borrowings from his own character repertoire, particularly his bad-boy-with-a-heart-of-gold from ""Thelma and Louise"". Hopkins plays it more or less as his ""Bounty"" captain/tyrant persona.<br/><br/>And the premise is somewhere between ""Being There"" and ""The Seventh Seal"". Brest has no idea of how to tap into Bergman's angst, so he attempts some Kubrickian inertia. No dice there either. The lakeside party is filmed in the manner of ""The Godfather II"". <br/><br/>I suppose this makes fine chick-flick grist, what with all the facial close-ups on Pitt during the love scene. But this does nothing for me; no irony, no narrative games, just parts of better predecessors on loan."

The only answer I can find is that the movie would have been the absolute pits. AH sustained this movie from start to finish. Without him, it would not be worth the cost of blank DVD disk.<br/><br/>The story was blah, the other actors were more blah. Claire (Susan) was unbearably saccharine and inept to the point where she made me wince with embarrassment. That constant flitting of her eyes up and down and left and right.. ugh! Coupled with her shifty smile/grimace, it was enough to bring out the barf bag. I cannot understand how this can be anyone's definition of emoting.<br/><br/>Brad Pitt didn't have a whole lot to do, except stand around looking impassive and making monosyllabic dialog. Wouldn't have been any better/worse if they'd picked the other actor best suited to playing a lamp-post - Keanu Reeves.<br/><br/>In terms of storyline, it was just passably interesting. ""Heaven Can Wait"" with Warren Beatty was more interesting, in the same theme.<br/><br/>I watched it on AMC too, and cussed my way through every commercial break. Just wanted the damn thing to finish, so I could check it off my to-watch list. In the end, I wasn't sure whether I cussed more at the commercials or at the movie itself."
"evilhinata","5","1","3","5 October 2005"," Good concept, however too slow in delivery
","""Meet Joe Black"" begins with this brilliant concept- to personify Death; however the deliverance of the concept, like so many other movies, falters. The movie begins with Willaim Parrish, Anthony Hopkin's character, a highly successful man, with money and power. He is suddenly visited by Death, which takes the form of Brad Pitt's character. Death or Joe Black, as Parrish introduces him as, ask for a tour of human society, and in return, Parrish will have more time on Earth. As the story goes on, this all goes well until, Joe Black falls in love with Susan, Parrish's daughter. Overall I thought the movie started very well, but was average in an entire sense. The movie was much too long ( three hours), and the story seemed to drag. The plot seemed to elongate some scenes, and sometimes the plot seemed too dramatic, trying to send too many messages. If you have three hours to kill or really enjoy Brad Pitt see it, otherwise, you can understand the whole point of the story by reading the description on the back of the DVD cover."

The people who level this criticism obviously have no idea about films that take their time, which when done properly reward the viewer much more richly than any MTV goldfish attention span MTV Hollywood-twee twaddle ever could. Claire Forlani has to be one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen and Brad Pitt is a much better actor than he is given credit for and the emotion that sparks between them is spell-binding.

As for Brad Pitt, well I'm neither female or under 14 so of course i realise he can only play two roles, sub Jack Nicholson mad or boringly bland, in the latter he's probably just playing himself.

More specifically, the blend with love and beauty, this very ancient ""Death and the maiden""-motive - it seems to GUARANTEE a heartbreaking, powerful movie. And then the disappointment. The script is so primitive, redundant and kitschy that you will not believe it. I disagree with many comments that say it was the fault of the actors. Hopkins is - although not brilliant - pretty O.K., and the Death-character would be even less convincing without Brad Pitt. (Of course, he has nothing that I would consider thrilling, sublime or from the ""hereafter"", but his 'strangeness' is well reached and there are some funny - in the good sense - parts even within the love story.) But the endless mistakes of the argument - that death makes friends with almost everybody, the never ending farewell-scenes, that the young guy from the coffee shops returns to guarantee the happy-end etc. - make this movie a very annoying sentimental garbage issue.

The screenplay is credited to four writers, and you can see why.  Each one probably took over as the other got bored with it.<br/><br/>The tag-line in my TV guide said ""Death takes a holiday and makes a deal with a dying billionaire"".  It takes about an hour to establish this premise.  That's it, just establishing it.  Then, apparently, Death falls in love with the billionaire's daughter.  Well, how or why Death does this isn't explained, but it's certainly made easy when the daughter is written as a slut.  A slutty billionaire's daughter getting her just deserts?

","Though among 1998's movies were quite a bunch of doozies, the decidingly dudly and deadly doozie is Meet Joe Black.  A film of immense inanity, Meet Joe Black contains one of the worst performances of the year (model/dilettante Claire Fontani) and one of the most embarrassing (Anthony Hopkins -- after starring in a film this bad, I would never act again too.) The only performance that stings me with regret for giving the movie a rating of 1 is Marcia Gay Harden's.  Her scene with Anthony near the end of Meet Overwrought Opus when she tells him that she knows he doesn't love her as much as his other daughter (Claire Fontani -- As If!) is heartbreaking and the only scene with genuine emotion.  I won't even discuss Martin Brest's style and technique as a director because all that comes to mind is ""Hack, Hack, Hack."""
"arthurwade-18694","Null","1","5","10 November 2018"," Rather dull feature film considering the amount of talent involved
","Meet Joe Black is ultimately a disappointment and an an exercise in how one should understand the pacing of the movie. Starring Brad Pitt, Claire Forlani and Anthony Hopkins this is based on an older film called Death takes a Holiday (1934). Brad Pitt dies and is reborn as ""death"" and enters a wealthy mogul's life to understand the meaning of life, meanwhile falling in love with his daughter. The pacing is a killer and sorry to say but the acting is pedestrian- especially Brad Pitt. It seems they're all here to collect paychecks to buy mansion, the likes shown in this film. Avoid."
"GerryofNorVA","2","1","6","14 January 2020"," Worst love story before Gigli happened
","My two star rating is largely for the production values and a star cast that includes luminaries Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt. The highly implausible, largely senseless story and plot get a zero unless you're a tween girl who cares for nothing other than seeing a wooden/stoic Brad smooching his leading lady (unknown Claire Forlani), which must be why this film gets scores in the 8/9/10 range. Yes, it's a fantasy that involves death personified but granting you that as an element of the story is fine. It's the presentation and execution of this character that shows a level of immaturity and implausibility not typically associated with director Martin Brest, but then again this is the guy that went on to direct Ben Affleck and J-Lo in ""Gigli"" one of the worst romances of all time, so bad in fact, that it was Brest's last stint as a director! So, clearly ""Meet Joe Black"" was a descent into the disastrous ""Gigli""."
"JakeBrinkman","3","1","6","1 September 2019"," Simply bland
","This movie left me repeatedly wondering how such an interesting concept could be portrayed so blandly. Pitt is charismatic and charming as the coffee shop man, and his Caribbean accent was spot on, but his attempt at making Joe Black mysterious doesn't ever show any emotion at all. Hopkins also provides no emotional depth to his character, reacting with bizarre calm when told things that should be truly terrifying. The few times that he does, the emotions seem very muted, downplaying the events that he is reacting to. Everyone else's performances are equally forgettable, but I was honestly surprised to see such blandness from the usually memorable Pitt and Hopkins.<br/><br/>The cinematography was also unmemorable. It reminded me of the early age of US films, where most movies were based on plays or written as a play, intentionally refusing to change the scenery or show anything other than cookie-cutter lighting and camera angles, utterly failing to take advantage of the play's transition to film. Likewise, the music also never swells with emotion or attempts to make the score memorable in any way.<br/><br/>A bland and forgettable film is bad enough, but when it's stretched out to a 3-hour length, it makes for a truly poor excuse for art."

","This is quite an unusual drama with a screwed up romance and a real hunk with a pretty evil mind in it. Basically Brad Pitt (with a name unknown) meets Susan Parrish (Claire Forlani) in a coffee shop, and when she disappears, he is hit by two cars. Meanwhile, William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), Susan's Dad is hearing voices in his head after a short heart attack, and soon enough, the person he hears appears before him. This person, who William gives the name Joe Black (Pitt) explains that he borrowed a human body (which explains the accident) and wants to live in his world until it is time for William to die. In other words, Death, or the Grim Reaper, wants to live on Earth. As you get to know Joe, you discover that he takes lives, but he has never experienced the Earth he takes them from. Eventually, he and Susan fall in love because of Joe's ""kindness"" that you wouldn't expect from Death. But don't worry, he does do what he was meant to do at the end with a rather happy/sad ending. Also starring Jake Weber as Drew, Marcia Gay Harden as Allison Parrish and Jeffrey Tambor as Quince. Brad Pitt was number 15, and Sir Anthony Hopkins number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Hopkins was also number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, Pitt was number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Pitt was number 30, and Hopkins number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor.

","I guess the pitch for this movie went something like this : "" It`s a touching romantic fantasy where death in a human form comes to take the life of a millionaire but death falls in love with the millionaire`s daughter "" . This might have been a success if someone hadn`t said the following two things <br/><br/>1 ) "" Great . Let`s make a movie that lasts three hours ""<br/><br/>
2 ) "" let`s cast Brad Pitt as death ""<br/><br/>That`s my two criticisms of this movie . How on earth could anyone working at a Hollywood studio believe that a romantic fantasy has enough legs to last 178 minutes ? I guess that`s because so much of the running time is taken up with Brad Pitt on screen doing basically nothing as the camera holds his gaze , I mean look at the number of times the camera lingers on Pitt , it`s like someone`s told Pitt to just stand there while the camaraman has nipped out to lunch . I know a lot of females in the audience can`t get enough of Brad but is this a good reason for stringing out a film to twice its natural length ? The story could been easily told in 90 minutes if someone had decided to edit out all the scenes with Pitt staring into camera for no apparent reason <br/><br/>Not to be totally negative MEET JOE BLACK does have a couple of good points. With the exception of Pitt , who as usual shows us he was cast entirely down to his looks rather than talent or charisma , the cast give touching understated performances , and it goes without saying Anthony Hopkins gives the best performance of the lot . Perhaps the film`s best point is Thomas Newman`s score which absolutely beautiful and you`ll be able to remember it for days afterwards . If truth be told the score belongs in a better film"

There is nothing meaningful​ in the movie or heartfelt about it, accept necrophilia between Brad and the CEO's Daughter (last movie like that was Weekend at Bernies but it sucks and we forgave it for being a comedy, this is a serious drama for goodness sake!) All you see is Pitt that turned into a boring zombie without bruises, isn't like the charming so and so at the coffee shop, that gorges on peanut butter that isn't old as time, stuffs his face like an infant, and mimics a weird Jamaican accent who might become a murder suspect to our Anthony and if not careful. I am not one of those gullible females fortunately, that is what makes judgement easy for me on this lame film.

","Hollywood periodically decides to take ultimate superhuman spirit concepts such as God/The Devil/Death/Angels/etc personifies them and enters them into some little human dramas. In this iteration Death is a human form god; the human drama includes a dying billionaire some hostile politics in a company board room, the IRS (did the writers intend some humor? death/taxes) and of course the central boy meets girl romance.<br/><br/>Using Death as a Pluto like God is bit odd especially in a non horror movie. <br/><br/>In this high dollar rendition ($90 million),Death takes over the dead body of Brad Pitt and makes a Faust like deal with Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins a billionaire with heart problems can live a few more days until a birthday party his daughters are giving him--if he acts as guide to show death around earth. How imbecilic and trite is it possible to get? Death is one of those poor somehow shackled superhuman spirits who doesn't know what life on earth is like.. Basically a pack of idiotic garbage on every level. Death predictably falls in love with Hopkin's daughter and wants to take her with him a la Prosperpine.<br/><br/>OK, fine how is this plot carried off as a film?

","When ""Meet Joe Black"" got released, a lot of people went to see it just for the ""Phantom Menace"" trailer.

The movie itself is probably best known for getting Universal executive Frank Biondi fired due to the movie's weak performance (a mere two weeks later, the dismal performance of ""Babe: Pig in the City"" got Casey Silver fired). Leave it to Robin Williams to give the studio a hit (""Patch Adams"" was Universal's only successful movie in 1998; it got the studio out of the hospital, you might say).<br/><br/>Anyway, back to this one. Director Martin Brest is best known for ""Beverly Hills Cop"" and ""Scent of a Woman"" (his last effort, 2003's ""Gigli"", became a punchline and pretty much ended his career). It probably says something about Hollywood that the director of one of the most famous movies of the '80s is practically unmentionable nowadays.<br/><br/>Basically, even if you interpret the movie as a look at the meaning of life, it's still three hours leading to a cop-out ending.

That is nothing compared to the dread that viewers are asked to be ready for. With a plot of absolute absurdity with an ending that makes no sense. Everyone raises questions as to who Joe Black is. As seen here he is a grim reaper type who enters the life of a wealthy business person and draws curiosity from everyone. Directed with a sense of wonder by Martin Brest who previously made such films as Scent of a Woman and Beverly Hills Cop. Technically well crafted with an excellent performance by Anthony Hopkins whose fate isn't exactly uplifting but he brings the one element of great compliment to the film. Brad Pitt isn't so lucky. He begins as a real person who encounters Hopkins's daughter in a coffee shop before being struck by a car in a horrible scene done with unfitting humour. His wonderment with regards to things such as peanut butter are off putting as well. In supporting work there is Marcia Gay Harden as Hopkins's wife, and Clair Forlani as Hopkins's daughters whose presence is to hint possible innuendo with Pitt. Jeffrey Tambor plays a business associate to the Hopkins character. Misplaced humour and a character we never get to know sabotage this deadpan film. Score: 2 ½ / 10"

The script is weak, the direction...ordinary. The dreariness of the Joe character buries the film. The movie has no charm, humor and cleverness. Pitt wanders through the role like an automaton. It reminded me a bit of Peter Sellars in Being There but without the script, charisma or humor to make it work. This movie has been done before in other incarnations and this type of story works best when it doesn't take itself so, so seriously. I would love to see a remake with the same story but a much better script."

","Death takes a holiday and spends some time with a media mogul before he takes him away. Death falls in love with the mogul's daughter. And decides to take her too. Then doesn't. That's the entire plot. It takes takes three bum-numbing hours to tell. A stultifyingly dull, three hours which culminates in the most leadenly-paced Hollywood Bullshit ending imaginable.<br/><br/>Death here is played as a wide-eyed innocent abroad by Brad Pitt who manfully layers on autistic ticks and mannerisms over a wildly variable script. His character is unable (at selective 'comic' moments) to understand common idioms while, at other times, is capable of layering on the profundity and metaphor with a trowel. At one point - after being told that another character was talking through his hat says ""No, he's talking through his lips!"" Ho ho ho.<br/><br/>Claire Forlani plays the woman with whom he falls in love, and plays her with a subdued gaucheness so that in every scene she spends so much time twitching her lips (in a manner henceforth known as 'Zellwegering') and looking out of the corners of her eyes, that she looks like she's about to have a fit. The innumerable 'almost' love scenes between her and the Death character are an agony: endless alternating over-the-shoulder close ups of her twitching her eyes at everything but him, and him Aspergering his gaze at everything else in the room but her. Whole hours of this stuff go by without them looking at each other once - and then they have sex which is more of the same with fewer clothes and less dialogue.<br/><br/>In the end (the interminable endless end) the media mogul happily walks off with Death, after everyone has wrung every phony ounce of syrupy sentiment out of every single frame. (I nearly went into a sugar coma when Daddy and daughter had a final dance with to that saccharine hymn to trash sentimentality ""What a Wonderful World"") And then! (Incoming bullshit overload!) Death isn't Death anymore! He's the guy the daughter fell in love with in the first act brought back from some ill-defined afterlife by a stroke of the writer's pen. The daughter says, ""I wish you could have known my dad,"" and off they walk to the accompaniment of glorious fireworks. All a bit sudden (well it would be if it wasn't all done so ponderously slowly) considering she hasn't even seen that her dad is dead, or, if she just somehow 'knew' it, she bothered to grieve even for a second. The poor bugger isn't even cold yet! and she doesn't shed a tear. But never mind, the movie needs a final sugar lump to end with so she's forgotten him for the vague promise of another go in the sack with Brad Pitt! <br/><br/>And I don't think I want to know what Spike Lee made of the only more-than-two-line part doled out to a black actor, a real 'Magic N****r' if ever there was one. Only she, a dying old lady ""from de Carribiyan"" (thus even more ""primitive"" than her New York urbanised daughter) can see Death for who he is, ""Obeah mon. I gonna die,"" she says when he sees him for the first time. ""No obeah, sister."" replies Pitt doing an Ali G. ""No duppy, no jumbie. Evera ting gon' be irey."" <br/><br/>No it isn't. I got type two diabetes from watching this film."

","I will keep this short as this movie has been reviewed many times before. There is some stellar acting in this movie, a truly excellent cast and a fantastic concept. Brad Pitt does an amazing job seeming truly alien in this movie. The ending however is just terrible and completely forced. I wont give anything away but the acting in the very last scene completely breaks down as characters are forced to act in unnatural ways to facilitate the ending that was scripted. It's not a matter of poor acting but a script that has characters behaving in ways that are completely contrived for the sake of the ending the writer or director chose."
"Laakbaar","7","0","1","14 February 2014"," It goes by in a blink
","The two main characters in this movie are Death and Bill Parish (Anthony Hopkins). The conceit is that death takes human form for a while to experience human existence in various ways, blackmailing urbane, rich, successful Bill to be his guide. Death takes a holiday. The Angel of Death, the Grim Reaper, in this movie isBrad Pitt. Of course, Joe and Bill's daughter fall for each other.<br/><br/>This meaningful movie has a number of profound themes. The main theme is the acceptance of death — not a light subject for a feel-good Hollywood movie, but it works well enough. A second theme is Bill's simple message to live life to its fullest, with no regrets, because your years ""go by in a blink"". (Isn't that true!) Another extended theme is the father-daughter bond.<br/><br/>I found this to be a melancholic and slow movie. I was willing to go along with the ""Death walks among us"" conceit, but Bill was a little too quick to accept Joe for who he was. The heart attack scenes didn't impress it on me enough.<br/><br/>Hopkins, Forlani, Harden and Tambor were quite good. Pitt was strongest in the scenes with the Jamaican woman. I didn't really enjoy Brad Pitt in this film, although he played his role well enough for it not to ruin the film for me. I'm not sure whether it was him or the lines given to his character. The Pinocchio-becomes-a-real-boy idea has been done before, and that's essentially what this was.<br/><br/>It is clever to see death as a looming, almost-human presence that accompanies us as we get fatally ill or very old; however, if death were to become Death, I don't think it would be like this.<br/><br/>Interestingly, 15 years after its release, the film is being shown on Valentine's Day and billed as a sort of archetypal love story. I suppose it is a grand love story, but I found it hard to get a handle on that aspect. I kept looking for a meaning of some kind in the love story, eg infatuation as a form of suicide; le grand mort découvert le petit mort, that sort of thing. This film falls into the categories of (effective) tear-jerker and chick flick (complete with a shot of Pitt's abs), but at times it became a little too silly and unrealistic for me.<br/><br/>I'd see this movie unless chick flicks, slow-paced films, long films, and tearjerkers are absolutely not your thing. Like it or not, we all struggle with death. I'd like to see more films that help us to understand death (rather than just showing it)"

","I bought the VCR (2 tape set) of this, still shrink rapped, at Half Price for $1.00. I really enjoyed watching the first tape, but should have stopped there. The second tape brought the story and the characters to a dead halt. I just can't imagine why anyone thought it was necessary to extend this film to the length it is. How to trim it? First, the silly side story about the planned merger with another company could be jettisoned entirely, which would also allow us to jettison entirely the character of Drew, Susan's boyfriend (is he her fiancé ... who knows?). This irritating character adds nothing to the story. If we need a boardroom scene to show Bill's character, then put one in and be done with it.<br/><br/>The other way to shorten the film would be to cut the duration of all of Susan's scenes by half. A skinny Angelina Jolie who squints like Clint Eastwood. Only Death and Drew would find her interesting (except for for her being the daughter of a mega rich father).<br/><br/>Aside from the length, the ending didn't do much for me. Susan sees her father and Death walk over a hill, and only Death come back. She asked not a word about where her father went. Anyone who has lost a parent knows that no matter how long it was in coming, it's still a tragic moment,esp when it's the last parent to die. All Susan can do is get googly-eyed (again) at Death.<br/><br/>Pitt delivers all his lines in a monotone that would make Kevin Costner jealous. Death, who has been around for thousands of years, doesn't know how to speak?"

","Brad Pitt in this film looks very much like the young Robert Redford. And Robert Redford, before he was well known, appeared in a Twilight Zone television episode playing Mr. Death. It's hard to believe the screenwriters were unaware of that earlier program. The Twilight Zone episode is at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K78iduBHLpQ (Part 1) and http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YKOhsM6CNc (Part 2). The Twilight Zone episode was over in 30 minutes. But the film, albeit with a more complicated plot than the TV program, was way too long. The gimmick in both the movie and the TV program is that Death does not have the usual ominous appearance but rather is an appealing looking young man. That premise can carry a short TV program but not a movie as long as this one."

","Meet Joe Black outlines the story of an older man who, nearing the final days of his life, strikes a bargain with death where he will offer death the opportunity to interact with his friends and colleagues, and in turn death will offer him time on Earth. Death (having adopted the alias ""Joe Black""), has trouble understanding and relating to some human customs, most remarkably love, but throughout the film, manages to grasp a greater appreciation for what these concepts entail, and what it means to be human.<br/><br/>The charm of Meet Joe Black resides in the realist or humanist approach adopted by the film writers. Joe, accustomed to working alone under unrealistic circumstances, has to learn how to interact with people and think about other people besides himself. He also has to understand that the rules that govern human beings are different than what he is used to, and he cannot just shape the world according to his own liking. This in turn offers him both wonderful and painful experiences and deepens his understanding of the human race.<br/><br/>However, after 85 minutes of developing and enforcing this theme, the writers butcher it with a Utopian and completely implausible conclusion that rejects every lesson and metaphor that the movie had taught. My suggestion? You'll see Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt walking away from a large party towards the end, with Forlani in hot pursuit. At that point, stop the movie and quite while you're ahead."
"Cristi_Ciopron","7","0","4","10 August 2008"," I certainly repeatedly enjoyed it,despite its .../daddy Hopkins is the drawback
","Pére Hopkins looks very embarrassed with his roleone of his worst everand one of hideously bad performances, too. It's,yet,hugely funny to see him so embarrassed, and taking the wrong approach to his rolestriving to give it an inadequate depthit is _burlesquely bad! The directing, in the sense of an idea, a directorial approach, a sense of the whole, is entirely absent. The young actors are absolutely delightful to watchPitt, in an almost exquisitely playful disposition, and getting exactly the sense a fun that such a melodrama could bearvery light, playful, ambiguous touches. Hopkins wants, tries to play it straighthe understands absolutely nothing of the valences of the scripthe charges, he overdoes the role --superposing a straight but void composition on a crap script. The movie's idea is ironic, playful and of a dubious taste, somewhat underdeveloped. Hopkins brings in some Teutonic seriousness. (In fact, he looks so gentlemanly that he is perfectly fit for roles of butlers. Much less for philosophers, etc.; there's always a residuum of his butler awareness ).<br/><br/>Hopkins thought he was rescuing a crap fantasy, with his dignified, gloomy seriousness, a cross between ANDRONICUS and the celebrated butler --yet, it is extremely _unserious to behave like him in such a movie that stems from an entirely different principlea farcical onesit is a game, a play, Pitt got that, he acts like that, but Hopkins is sulking and will have no part in it . He spoils the movie's core. The director needed to have at least a minimal grasp of the movie's type; he has none. Hopkins needed at least a minimal understanding of his role; he has none. He is, and not only on behalf of this, a colossally bad actor. Of the De Niro league. Those unable to get the meaning of a role. Absolutely unable. Pitt,on the contrary, distinguishes himself once again as a very able actor, and extremely intuitive and, why not, even intelligent to a degree.<br/><br/>The script is a mess. Dare I say also a colossal one? Why would the Death give a bonus to this particular mortal? What sets him apart? Why is he not really scared by the Death's physical nearness? We were given to understand that, at 65 yrs., he still lives the emotions of a majorette ,etc., but I presume more is needed to make acceptable the idea of an old businessman taking so lightly the vicinity of Death. The old boss was, we see, tired, etc., swallowed by sloth to a degreeyet, the last man Death would need to have as guide in a journey around the world and its experiences. Frankly, Pére Hopkins looks like a boreand a deadly bore, a bore to death. None would choose him, from all, as guide.<br/><br/>I think the main mistake of the film is Hopkins' own mistakehe is a fabulously bad actor here . The Death needed a quick and witty oldsterthe movie is a light though melodramatic and weird comedya Lemmon, maybe, would have fit --but Hopkins ?How did they pick him? You see, Hopkins was not satisfied with a light, comic melodramahe wanted a Faustian thing, a farreaching drama, and he overplays his rolewhile everything in this movie could have been made passable only in Pitt's keyas lowbrow fun, with the degree of witty sophistication admissible in a lowbrow funny melodrama . Hopkins looks embarrassed, churning selfrighteously his scenery, and seems he believe he's in ANDRONICUS .Hey, daddy Hopkins, ever heard of light comedy (even with a grim substrate )? The substrate was supposed to be somewhat grim, not the actors' notions of their roles .And Pére Hopkins is striving towards a composition, a largescale one .<br/><br/>Pitt is one of the actors that I can not make my mind about yetI do not know yet if he is a good actor or not --in a sense, he seems superior to a Cruise or GereCruise, with his mechanic overplayed approachyet,he's not as immediately striking as Crowe or Spacey. It might be also that I have seen him in many fantasy rolespicturesque stuff mostly, like THE 12 MONKEYS or JOE BLACK. Or it might be also that he's better than Cruise (whose simplistic soulless mechanic overacting is misleading),but not as good as Crowe .<br/><br/>Like Depp, and maybe more, Pitt is an actor who's been in a lot of good or interesting or original movies; nowadays, that's quite an accomplishment. Better than Depp, Pitt has also been noticed as a reliable actor, and as a surprisingly gifted, committed and inspired performer. Besides the blockbusters and Mr. Smith crap, Pitt can be found in a quite amazing number of interesting moviesespecially of the '90s."

","I liked the story but I think a little more depth and realism could have been given to the characters. I don't know of too many families where everyone gets along all the time. For instance, the daughter who was not the favorite was OK with not being the favorite?? The natural psychology of that older unfavored daughter, Allison, would be jealousy for the favorite Susan. Also, there should have been at least one character who realistically said some last words that were not reminiscent of a eulogy. I wanted a little more realism with the characters having faults and making mistakes and saying the wrong things. Allison's words to her father about not being the favorite were beautiful but the script should have used those words in his eulogy from her. Then there is Susan who is the favorite. She showed little emotion when her father was 'saying goodbye.' Realistically, she should not have been so 'accepting' of the knowledge her father's departure with death. If it was me I would have been sobbing uncontrollably and running after him yelling, 'Daddy don't go! I love you! I need you! Don't leave me! Please come back!'"

","I requested this title at the video store, inspired by the reviews of others here. I felt a pang when I saw the Twin Towers in an opening shot.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, what a disappointment! Here's what went wrong for me. There was zero chemistry between Brad Pitt's character and the female lead, which left me unable to believe that these two people fell instantly in love. Despite my love of adult movie scenes, the sex in this film made me squirm. Further, the ""death"" character was played wrong for me. I wanted a figure who was powerful, all knowing, mystical, wise and symbolic. This guy was an annoying dolt.<br/><br/>I felt the director didn't know what to do with the death character, or the whole situation, and reverted back to the cliché of an innocent experiencing life for the first time, like a reincarnated caveman, someone awakening from a coma, or an alien. Even at that, let's deal with things more profound than the taste of peanut butter. <br/><br/>Brad's androgyny was distracting. I wanted this character to be more masculine, and every time he appeared he looked too much as if he had just stepped out of a make up and hair style chair. His puffy hair, dark roots, and harsh, artificial highlights were stiff and unmoving. I kept picturing him in a cape with aluminum foil getting his bleach job. (I tried not to look too closely to see if they had him in eyeliner.)<br/><br/>The sex scenes, as mentioned before, were a disappointment. The encounter was over in a flash, and done in what looked like a missionary position. He lies on top of her, she says "" I enjoyed that,"" and a day later he's telling her he has to go away. Is this what young people expect of sex? Think of the heat Hitchcock generated with his male and female leads without even showing us much skin.<br/><br/>There were a few good characters here.. notably the Anthony Hopkins character and the Jamacian woman, though the gimmick of Brad speaking her dialect in an overdone way was almost racist, as if to suggest she wouldn't be able to understand standard English. Would he have gone into Eubonics with a black character? Silly stuff.<br/><br/>One odd observation: Brad's love interest character was eerily similar to Angelina Jolie today..cool, aloof, alarmingly thin, pampered, friendless, with full lips. To me it was sad the female lead was eager to disrobe and have sex so fast in a public place. I didn't find her beautiful or appealing, and it seemed sad that she accepted an odd stranger so quickly despite the fact that she was engaged. <br/><br/>Speaking of her betrothed, the man was clearly odious from the first sight we get of him, so why was she clueless to this? I guess this was a necessary plot contrivance.<br/><br/>Some things have changed since this flick was made, and I wanted more.<br/><br/>megonly"

","What ever happened to Martin Brest? A ring of critical and financial successes -- ""Beverly Hills Cop,"" ""Midnight Run,"" ""Scent of a Woman"" -- and suddenly... ""Meet Joe Black""? ""Gigli""? Huh? This three-hour dramatic epic (yawn!) is a remake of an older film, which I hear is much, much better. The updated version stars Brad Pitt as Death. (Apparently Death takes on the form of young 30-somethings with strong abdominal mid-sections and glistening white teeth, despite having a taste for the gruesome. At least he's got a good fashion sense.) The movie starts with Brad Pitt meeting a pretty girl (Claire Forlani) and then being struck by a moving vehicle, which is one of the most unintentionally hilarious scenes in any film - ever. It's so fake and ridiculous; you can't help but laugh as a plush man gets pummeled by oncoming traffic and spins through the air dozens of times.<br/><br/>He dies and Death takes on his physicality, returning to earth to visit a poor old man named Parrish (oh! the symbolism!), played by Anthony Hopkins. Death claims it's time for Mr. Parrish to die. Mr. Parrish disagrees and offers to give Death a tour of the world in return for his soul. (Nevermind that he's in his sixties and has lived a full life and might very well die soon of natural causes anyway.) Death agrees. He meets Mr. Parrish's daughter, who happens to be...you guessed it... Claire Forlani! Oh my! What a coincidence! She falls in love with him, and he falls in love with her. Mr. Parrish disapproves of his daughter dating one of the Satan's spawn, but what the hell? At least he managed to get a few extra years out of his materialistic, financially-obsessive life.<br/><br/>""Meet Joe Black"" will instantly remind you of countless other films (unless this is your first movie). I do not hold a grudge against it because it's a ""chick flick"" - enjoy many so-called ""weepy"" films, but this just didn't do it for me. I found it pretentious, unnecessarily slow (come on, the story and the characters are not deep enough to warrant three hours) and ultimately very disappointing. Pitt and Hopkins are fine actors and watching them go through the motions in a dull wannabe-epic is quite unsatisfying. Add on top of this that Martin Brest officially sold out his career to the ruthless nature of the Hollywood circuit with this movie, and you can understand my nonexistent feelings for it."

It requires good casting, good performances from all the leading actors, good writing -- all of which this film lacks greatly. <br/><br/>Honestly, I'm not an actor in the least, but I could easily have played Brad Pitt's character far better than he does, with the whole dear in the headlights spacey thing he does throughout the movie.

","Yes, this was a really great movie.  However, there were some flaws, however minor.  When people who have seen the movie think of it they say, ""Oh, yeah, the one with Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins!""  They don't think of Claire Forlani, even though she was the lead actress.  She seems to be in the shadow of the two men (particularly Pitt), either because her performance was not as good as their's or because the part she portrayed did not allow her to stand out very much.  Pitt's acting in this movie was excellent, and I don't think I would have changed anything about his performance.  He really fit his part well.  Hopkins also did very well.  He was able to become his character nicely, but he didn't really seem to be that afraid of Death, in the movie.  Maybe that was the way it was supposed to be, but still, it might have helped.  Claire Forlani was very good, too, but she seemed to be in Pitt's shadow way too much.  It seemed like she was just in awe of him, as though he were a giant that she had to gaze up at in order to see.  Also, it was three hours.

","Like most folks here, I watch a lot of movies.  Even if a movie doesn't knock my socks off, I can usually find one or two lines or scenes good enough to justify time and money ""invested"".<br/><br/>This movie was the second time in a looooong time that I genuinely wish I had not bothered AT ALL.  (I won't tell you the other one, I am afraid to speak its name aloud).<br/><br/>I have a profound respect for Anthony Hopkins and generally enjoy Brad Pitt very much (his characterizations in Fight Club and 12 monkeys were amazing, in my view).  And I am glad to find Jeffery Tambor still working.<br/><br/>NOBODY could save this movie.  Watching it was like picking a piece of canned pineapple out of one's braces in a boring 6th grade lesson on an overcast day.  For three hours.  Watching it was like listening to a favourite record whilst someone randomly slowed down the playback with their finger, *just enough* to get under your skin and drive you nutty.

Sir Anthony Hopkins is, by all rights, one of the best actors still performing.  Claire Forlani is a beautiful actress that has a brilliant career ahead of her.  And of course there is Brad Pitt who has put out a decent amount of credible work. Even with this kind of acting muscle behind it the movie wasn't the gripping story that it should have been.<br/><br/>Most of this comes from the fact that the movie has such a dark undertone to it.  There isn't any real sense of joy at any point.  Even the love scenes between Pitt and Forlani leave you feeling as though it was just a cold exchange between two people weary from the troubles of their lives.  There just isn't any chemistry behind the two of them.<br/><br/>The story also tends to drag on.  A little more editing should have gone into the movie to get it to move a bit better.

","There is no crueller thing than to force a right-thinking individual to view, in its entirety, a Merchant-Ivory film.  They are ponderous and poorly cast - impossible to connect to in any way that is human, and more than likely infested with one or more of Helena Bonham Carter, Julian Sands, or Bernadette Peters.  Imagine my horror then, in discovering that there is a darker pit of culturally misguided artistry in the breast of that most American of directors: Martin Brest.  With a pedigree of such resoundingly poor films as Beverly Hills Cop (a film so woeful at its heart that Sylvester Stallone turned it down), Midnight Run, & Scent of a Woman,  it is with an admittedly heavy heart that during my latest masochism-fest, I picked up his dream project - Meet Joe Black.<br/><br/>A remake of a film that I've never heard of before, 1934's Death Takes a Holiday, Brest's film is a light romantic fantasy about Death manifesting itself as Brad Pitt to see what it's like to really live.  Judging by Pitt's performance, if Death really wanted to learn about life he probably should have chosen a better vehicle.  Death reveals himself to Anthony Hopkins who plays Bill Parish - a successful businessman and father of two grown daughters who, on his 65th birthday, will suffer a fatal heart attack. Before that happens, Death asks Bill to act as His guide to human experience.  Unpredictably, Brad Pitt's Death falls in love with Bill's youngest daughter, the very lovely but very grimace-y Claire Forlani, and finds Himself on the horns of a romantic dilemma.<br/><br/>Not enough plot for a three-hour film, you say?  Fear not - Bill is being robbed of his corporation by a vermin go-getting, Tim-Roth-Lookalike and it's up to Death to save his legacy.  He does this, not ironically, by posing as an IRS agent.  Have I forgotten to mention that Pitt, at one point, imitates a Jamaican accent to better communicate with a dying old Jamaican woman?  Oh yes, Claire Forlani (nurse Grimace as I like to call her), is a doctor of internal medicine and Death follows her on her rounds (HA!).  Anyone that's seen Seven Years in Tibet recognizes the unadvisability of Pitt doing an accent.  It would have been a nice thing if Pitt had done an imitation of a human being to better communicate with the audience.<br/><br/>Did I mention that this movie is actually 3 hours long?  To be fair, the film is nice to look at and, were any of the actors to actually speak in a normal cadence rather than their ponderous, measured, drippy-faucet, mumbling, it would only be 90 minutes.<br/><br/>The film fails as a romantic drama.  It fails as a romantic comedy (although the sensitive love-making scene is unintentionally hilarious, as is the scene where Pitt gets hit by two cars).  It fails as a dark fantasy - and as a light fantasy.  It fails as a drama of any sort - or anything that approaches whimsy or wit.  Already faltering, the film grinds to a crashing halt when it attempts to handle a neurotic older sister and her competition for her father's attentions.  In three hours, one has a reasonable right to expect some sort of reward.  The ending, however, is a bizarre, hackneyed thing that is so poorly tacked on it resembles in spirit that paper tail of that beknighted donkey of children's party fame after the retarded cajun with the helmet has had his turn.<br/><br/>There are so many questions that are raised by this sad monstrosity. Chief among them:<br/><br/>1. why is Death, omnipotent as he is, so clumsy around people?  Pitt plays him as some kind of Starman without the charming pathos (or the expected unfamiliarity of an alien with humanity). 2. why does Brad Pitt, so excellent in 12 Monkeys, Kalifornia, & Seven, suck out loud in this film?  You feel like turning up the RPM's on the turntable. One wishes someone had told him the camera was on. 3. why is Anthony Hopkins in this film?  I haven't seen Instinct yet, but I'm pretty sure this will be a question raised by that film as well. 4. why doesn't the daughter of the elderly Jamaican woman wonder why this young white man is mocking their accent so outrageously and poorly? 5. why did this film cost $90 million dollars and six months to make? 6. why did I watch the entire film?<br/><br/>There are more, but I wouldn't want to ruin it for you.  The only reason, really, to watch the sad, beknighted thing is found in the marginal joy one gets from watching the hollywood very beautiful and the very rich fail spectacularly in spectacularly embarrassing ways.<br/><br/>Meet Joe Black is a mess of a film.  It is the worst film that I've seen this week and I watched ten minutes of Vampires and all of End of Days. At one point, I switched the audio over to French and threw on the English subtitles.  The acting immediately improved and the dialogue, although still idiotic and terminally stilted, was at least in French, that native tongue of the idiotic and the terminally stilted. You must realize that any film that seems good in French is probably catastrophically poor in English. You'd be right if this is what you realize.<br/><br/>scale of 1-100 = 10 diseases I'd rather contract than watch it again: anthrax, an explosive viral infection that occurs primarily in cattle best frame of mind to view this film in: sado-masochistic sugar delirium"
"saraarts","6","0","1","27 May 2000"," Almost, but not quite...
","There are some really good things about this movie.  Pure originality is not one of them.  Good taste is not quite one of them either.<br/><br/>The good part:  The acting.  Excellent.  Jeffrey Tambor puts in the best performance I've ever seen from him, very natural and real.  Brad Pitt's portrayal of death is simply charming.  Anthony Hopkins is at the top of his form.  Claire Forlani and Marcia Gay Hardin make it obvious why their characters should be loved.  Jake Weber is perfectly believable. <br/><br/>
The bad parts:  the music, the recycled story (yet another in a long string of previously used material to be coughed out of Hollywood in the last five to ten years), a certain problem of taste.<br/><br/>The music is by Thomas Newman, the same composer who so brilliantly scored Oscar and Lucinda.  You can only tell it's him because of one particular theme which seems to have been lifted whole from the score of Oscar and Lucinda.  (It's so obviously similar that until I confirmed that the same composer had written both I was outraged at what I thought was an outright theft.)  The rest of the score is mostly either a medley of material by popular composers or the usual boring Dolby-ized swells thrown in way too often, even to the point of destroying delicate dialog. <br/><br/>
What is it with these Hollywood directors?  What is this fashion for hiring brilliant actors and then stomping on their lines with insultingly suggestive music?  Do I really need a swell of strings to tell me that dialog is poignant? that an exchange is respectful? that ""these characters are Men, dammit""?  Don't directors realize that Oscar winners and a decent script can usually do this -- and more -- all by themselves?<br/><br/>The story is hardly original.  The old parts are based on a play entitled ""Death Takes A Holiday.""  (This play was first made into a film with the same name in 1934, then into a TV movie in 1971.  Why oh why did we need another remake?)  The new parts appear to be cobbled together from or just mimicry of a lot of '80s and '90s movies about corporate greed and glamourous rich people.  If it weren't for the acting and the beautiful sets and costumes, no one would give a second thought to any of these characters.<br/><br/>Which brings me to taste.  Luxurious stuff everywhere on a set does not equate to good taste.  Now, this will sound mean, but I don't intend meanness.  Also, if the plot of this movie is not already clear as crystal to you thanks to two years of media saturation with a series of tediously explicit previews (another bad recent Hollywood trend), or from the tagline, or from the video cover itself, this might be a little bit of a spoiler, so beware.  But here goes.  <br/><br/>I love Claire Forlani's acting.  Nevertheless, I think she's too thin.  Most people are 10-20 pounds lighter than they appear on film.  In this film, Ms. Forlani looks like she weighs about 100 lb. <br/><br/>Now, I think most of the women on my screen are too thin these days. However, there is something particularly disturbing  about a woman so thin that you can see the articulation of her shoulder joints embracing as a lover the handsome and virile embodiment of death.  Enough said.<br/><br/>This movie had a budget of $90m (which should have been enough to at least buy an original story idea).  If the figures posted here on IMDb are accurate, it has yet to recoup more than approximately half.  I hope Hollywood starts to get some messages from this kind of math.  Maybe I'm not the only one watching movies who is sick of remakes, of terrifyingly thin women, and of stale and even insulting musical direction."
"Yossarian-","Null","0","1","17 April 2000"," The Reason Why Movements Such as the New Wave Came About
","Directed by Martin Brest, of Beverly Hills Cop and Scent of a Woman fame, this overlong and typically Hollywood remake of the 1930's classic, Death Takes A Holiday, casts Brad Pitt as a boyish Death wishing to experience life as humans do. He 'takes' the body of a charming young man whom charmed Claire Forlani (Hopkins doctor daughter) in a coffee shop. He then calls upon billionaire media mongol Anthony Hopkins, a paradoxically wise, kind, old-fashioned elderly man whose 'time is almost up' and makes a deal with him: Hopkins is to show him the world as humans see and experience it, and Pitt will extend Hopkins life. All that follow is predictable: Pitt and Forlani fall for each other all over again, and Hopkins teaches Pitt a thing or two about life. <br/><br/>Disappointing is perhaps one way to sum up Meet Joe Black. The story offers a great deal of potential and the director was clearly given more than enough resources to bring it to life. Despite this, the film feels static and overlong (the last hour in particular would have to be one of the most agonisingly frustrating and predictable pieces of cinema in history). You can literally see the dust floating past the characters in several scenes. Also, whatever message the film is trying to present (assuming that it is trying to present one at all) is so strongly diluted by contradictory statements. Messages of pro-euthanasia are nestled amongst those of patriarchy. Also, Pitt announces that 'Money can't buy you happiness', though it certainly appears that for Hopkins it did. Meet Joe Black is not all failure, production-wise the movie is scrumptious. In the end, however, Meet Joe Black proves even to itself that it is mere Hollywood candy: all style and no substance, leaving the audience teased and uninspired."

Pitt once again proves that he's in a dead-heat with Keanu Reeves for the worst, most overpaid actor of all time.  Hopefully Hopkins just did it for the money, though his acting skills are also a bit overpaid and overrated.  As creaky as the original is by today's standards, at least it told the same story in half the time!  Oh, another 90's drawback: much of the dialogue between Pitt and his leading lady is inaudible.  This is someone's idea of good acting?  They should be forced to work in a theatre where people will walk out if they can't hear the actors!"

"Tob1","Null","0","1","18 November 1999"," Death meets love
","There's a trend to make films about angels, messengers of death and the Evil one himself. Here's another example of Hollywood's obsession with the supernatural and how the culture clash happens when someone not from this world is thrown into the pot of the big city. This could be Crocodile Dundee 3 if except for the crocodiles themselves. William Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), industrial leader, father of 2, on the verge of dying, one night hears a voice inside his head. What to do and who was it? Death arrives a couple of hours later in the shape of Joe Black (Brad Pitt)knocking on the front door at a late dinner in Parrish's huge mansion.<br/><br/>Of course Death falls in love with Parrish's youngest daughter, Susan, who of course is already with a cocky young executive at her dad's communication company. From here on the movie starts to play with the idea of what happens if Death starts to get human feelings. It's a little bit like Terminator 2 where Arnie's robot finds himself caring for the people he is supposed to protect. All this happens while Bill Parrish is trying to save his company on the last days of his life, saving his life monument and besides his daughters, the only positive thing he's done in his life.<br/><br/>Hopkins is by far the film's best actor but this is not a very good movie. It lacks from conflict, it's too much of City of Angels and not enough of The Devil's advocat's provocativeness. All in all, a movie that all Pitt lovers will cherish because of his ""cute"" hair but for the one who wants something mind challening, watch something else."

I don't think that I have ever watched a movie that took so long to say so little.  As a rule, I find movies that deal with the supernatural highly suspect. This is particularly true of those that try to do so in a ""user-friendly"" manner as MJB tried to do. As always, Anthony Hopkins' performance was magnificent, but, unfortunately, that was about the only thing that made this movie bearable. Brad Pitt is a very good (if not, yet, great) actor, but his talent isn't enough to shine through this dim-witted romp through never-never land. He spends most of his time throughout the movie just standing around eating peanut butter, being coyly silent and smiling like the cat that ate the canary.  The ""cafe scene"" early in the movie was very good, with good interaction between Pitt and Claire Forlani, but the rest of the movie was, well, just plain dead.

","Oh dear, nightmare.<br/><br/>Personifications of death crop up quite a lot in cinema, but in my view seldom with so little effect as here.  <br/><br/>I join with everyone else in being delighted by the ""coffee shop"" scene at the start.  But after that, we have a slothful grind through some suspect acting and a plot (and sub-plots) which defy belief even in the context of a film based on death taking a holiday in the US. <br/><br/>Clare Forlani is of course not offensive to the eye, but I did worry about her repertoire of acting techniques.  To cheer you up during your nye-on 3 hour sitdown, I suggest you count the number of times she stares at Pitt or Hopkins as they talk, then looks away to stare into the middle distance, gulps and nods rapidly a couple of times.  Presumably that was doing ""sensitive and vulnerable"", but after a few repeats I didn't really care.<br/><br/>Pitt, well, less said the better about his attempts for much of the film at imitating the lobotomised bloke in ""Planet of the Apes"".  And Hopkins does what he can, but is stuffed by having to play the straight man in a comedy double act with robot-boy.<br/><br/>I was fed this as an in-flight movie after I had seen it once in the cinema, it's an hour shorter, a mercy in itself, but the scenes which are cut leaves it even more confused.  Almost everything about Hopkins' business activities goes out the window, along with the best (only) one-liner in the film.<br/><br/>The film may be good for people who have missed the difference between sentimentality and romance and I would recommend it to them.

Also, if this is supposed to raise the question of angels giving up immortality for a sexual relationship it fails poorly. If angels do have the choice and Biblically there are references to angels leaving their first habitation, I doubt that God would allow his angelic messenger to ""sow his wild oats"" without consequence."

","Meet Joe Black was a big fat dumb bore that got more and more ridiculous especially with the idea that death comes to earth in the form of a man with plans to stand by some old rich guy and watch him work then fall in love with the old man's daughter (who if she found out will be found in the tabloids with the headings: I SLEPT WITH DEATH). As everyone knows this film is too LONG! Three hour of babbling is just pointless and could be condensed into a mere hour! The movie was a joke - a pointless waste of time."

","At $787,000 per minute, ""Meet Joe Black"" may be the most expensive afternoon nap Hollywood and American audiences have taken in years! With an inane and completely predictable plot, helpless actors who seem to have been told to count to 30 between each line of dialogue, laughably pompous production values and Brad Pitt's particularly lame performance as ""Death,"" this huge ship of fools sinks in three hours while the Titanic only took two!<br/><br/>The many reviews of this film both here and in the press have dealt with the more obvious shortcomings but one cannot deny that Claire Forlani gives the most mannered performance since Sandy Dennis.  Her eyes seem to dart everywhere except into those of her fellow actors.  She's truly painful to watch."

","Not a bad film, as such, but it seemed to drag rather. The idea was good, and so was the portrayal, but it all got just a tad tedious. Would have made a great 2-hour film. At nearly three hours I had trouble staying awake!"

","Is it possible that Brad Pitt could be even more beautiful? I sympathise for those other reviewers who thought it was just too lengthy. The fantastic budget for this movie could only be for salaries and staging because otherwise how else can you explain the big price tag for a movie without special effects."
