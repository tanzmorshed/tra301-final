","Well, first of all, when I read the review for the movie in my hometown paper, I was a little scared that Pirates might be a let down. The trailer and the movie clips, it seemed, didn't really let on that there was much of a story line -- that it just kind of goes on and on and on, like the Matrix 2, with no storyline -- just fighting. Plus, most people do agree: sequels are hardly ever as good as the originals. And in this case, it's true... Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't the original. But, its an awesome movie in its own right! There are a few surprises in this movie. A few characters come back from the first that you wouldn't expect to see in the second. but... um! that's all I'm saying. This movie is definitely a lot more violent and gory than the first one. Don't bring the little kids to it. But, trust me -- this is not a Matrix-type movie... There is an actual storyline. And a good one at that. Capt. Jack Sparrow is back as well as Elizabeth and Will, who are forced to find him and obtain his compass, or else they will face the gallows. Well, actually, Will has to find him. Elizabeth escapes, and yes... as you've seen in the trailers, she does dress up like a man for this movie. Making it all the more comical. (you'll see what I mean).<br/><br/>The comedy was superb in this movie. Of course, it wasn't as good as the first, but you can't expect it to be. Yes, there were a few instances were they could've shortened the fighting scenes, but it was very well shot and scripted.<br/><br/>I wish they would've changed a few things about the movie, but you can't have everything. And don't expect everything to be resolved at the end. No! There's a cliff-hanger ending that leaves you wanting the watch the next one the moment the credits start rolling.<br/><br/>If you like the first movie, you'll like the second... And that's all I'm saying.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow: ""Why is the rum *always* gone?"" (he stands up and staggers) ""Oh... That's why."""
"baelara","8","73","97","8 August 2006"," Great fun, perfect visuals
","This movie has everything a good blockbuster should have: star cast, special effects, a healthy dose of drama, romance, a villain (so to say), sadly also a rather weak story, with an ending just calling for ""part three"" (just like the last second in the Matrix trilogy) I didn't get that feeling, that the adventure is finished somehow, more like a soap opera ending. On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates. <br/><br/>All and all: go and see this, sit down in that cinema and have a good time with friends, but if you are more into ""heavy for the mind"" stuff, this is not a must-see for you."
"bmelanie","8","105","146","10 July 2006"," Shamelessly entertaining
","Some blockbuster movies pretend to be more than they actually are. They sometimes even try to be philosophical. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', thank goodness, does no such thing. From start to finish, it practically flaunts the fact that it is pure and utter entertainment, comic yet breathtaking. The slapstick comedy involving the various sequences on the cannibal island and the water mill are amusing, the scenes at sea with the Flying Dutchman and the Kraken draw gasps, and, as ever, the antics of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow brings endless pleasure. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann does her share too, but Orlando Bloom as William Turner is still somewhat...wooden, perhaps because of the insipid character that he plays. His (almost idiotic) chivalry and goodness simply does not click with the mischievous magnetism that Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann delivers. He still does amuse from time to time, however. The supporting cast is truly stellar; Bill Nighy as Captain Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgard as Bill 'Boostrap' Turner and Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma are simply brilliant. Bill Nighy delivers his lines with aplomb, smacking his lips as if he relishes each syllable. Stellan Skarsgard is completely believable as the wretched Bootstrap Bill, a man who has fallen to the depths as far as he can go, and yet can still find the strength to endure it all in the love he has for his son, William. Naomie Harris is just as charismatic as the former two, but her charisma is not menacing or stoic but mysterious and even alluring. When she grins her black-toothed grin, one cannot help but grin along with her. In the end, 'Dead Man's Chest' is a roller-coaster-ride of a movie that thoroughly exploits every minute of its two-and-a-half-hour running time, ending with a final cliffhanger that leaves people feeling excited yet frustrated. (Remember when you watched 'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' and realized that you would have to wait another year for 'The Two Towers'? Like that.) NB. If you have the patience, stay till the end of credits. It's mildly amusing."
"ccthemovieman-1","9","22","27","22 November 2008"," Best Of The 'Pirates' Trilogy, And Demo-Quality For Blu-Ray
","After seeing all three of the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" films, I still think this second one was easily the best of the three. Most friends disagree with me on this, but.....hey, we all look at films differently.<br/><br/>This was the best ""Pirates"" to me because it had some fascinating new characters; it did not have the sappy or annoying characters and romance of the first film; it had just the right mix of action and lulls and it had some super special-effects and humor. Much of that good stuff, unfortunately, was overdone in the third film.which also dragged on too long. This movie isn't short, but none of the action scenes go on too long and so the entire two-and-a-half hours is entertaining.<br/><br/>Also (and this goes for all three of the movie) it looks absolutely super on Blu-Ray. It's the reason POTC is often shown in electronic stores promoting high-definition televisions because this film is about as good-looking as it gets. It's incredibly sharp.<br/><br/>The newest main character is the multi-tentacled ""Davy Jones,"" and he's a real hoot. Who knows how many hours each day poor Bill Nighy had to sit in the makeup room before ""Davy"" was ready for action. (Actually, the same good be said for Johnny Depp's ""Capt. Jack Farrow, who wears almost has much makeup as the late Tammy Fae Bakker.) Anyway, between the battles of both land and sea, something interesting always is going on or being said in this movie, making it a fun ride all the way."
"WithoutWings","10","523","809","6 July 2006"," Captivating
","As a sequel, it had much to live up to the glory of the first film, and personally, I thought it had done rather well. The special effects on Bill Nighy (Davey Jones) and his pirate crew was perhaps the best; it was very realistic. The movie had a bit of a slow start, but overall was a wonderful film. Johnny Depp did well in his portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow, as previously in the first film. Keira Knightley and Bill Nighy were also of mentionable performances. I thought Orlando Bloom was a little wooden, as I thought of his performance in the first film, but still believable and he managed to pull it off. The ending which was rather interesting, served its purpose in suspense. It left the audience hanging, and it also left me hanging in a buzz of questions. I'm extremely eager to see the next Pirates of Caribbean film. However, the film did contain quite a number of references to the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, and I advise you to recap your knowledge of the first film and re-watch it to get the gist. <br/><br/>Overall, I believed the second Pirates of Carribbean was a rather good film, and very successful in standards of sequels. I can't wait for the third."
"jaarlei","9","535","835","5 July 2006"," A wonderful film
","I just came out of the movie 30 minutes ago (as it was released a day before America over here).<br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning - the CGI is top rate and you won't spend the whole film groaning about how fake things appear on the screen.<br/><br/>Acting was brilliant. Johnny Depp once again proves why he's the only man alive who can play the role of Cap. Jack Sparrow. There's a great number of returning characters from the first film - including a couple I was very happy to see again.<br/><br/>My only fault was perhaps that this film lack a certain 'heart' that the first film had, which I believe came because the first film was something very different, which of course this film couldn't contend with.<br/><br/>That aside, you will hardly notice it. There's a good plot, wonderful sets, great acting and plenty of laughs. One of the best films I've seen all year thus far - can't wait for the 3rd one!"

","I only have one thing to say about this film... BRILLIANT (with a capital B)! Although there were some brilliant moments in the film, it was Johnny Depp who was a standout for me. His witty moments (especially when he says 'Oh, bugger' when confronted by the tribe) were wonderful. There are some moments here that were nasty (not gross/gory nasty), so the little kiddies may want to avoid this one. (It is rated M in Australia, PG-13 for America) But, it was a brilliant film. If you don't get to see it on the big screen, get the DVD when it comes out. You will not be disappointed! P.S. Did anyone love the new Walt Disney Pictures logo at the beginning? I did.

"samseescinema","8","171","275","2 July 2006"," Dead Man's Chest is great entertainment
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest <br/><br/>reviewed by Sam Osborn<br/><br/>rating: 3.0 out of 4<br/><br/>More, more, more seems to be the theme running through Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. There's more adventure, more violence, more pirates, and more myth. Not to mention that two and a half hour running length. But while Superman Returns may have dragged some in its 150 minutes, Pirates hurtles along at a pace only expected from the offspring of a Disneyland theme-ride, rarely slowing for piddling bits of nonsense like, oh say, story. Of course, story's not the point of these flicks and it surely doesn't have to be. There's entertainment enough to be had without all the other hodgepodge. And Pirates 2, for all its expansion, manages to dodge common sequelitis pitfalls. It doesn't overdose on a memorable character from the original (cough, Matrix Revolutions, cough) or over-broaden it's scope (cough, Matrix Reloaded,cough). Dead Man's Chest is a continuation of the original Pirates adventure, just with a couple extra unmarked sails tacked onto its deck. <br/><br/>The plot has something to do with ole' Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, of course) and his debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Debts, as we've all learned by now, are not things Mr. Sparrow is most proficient at repaying. The Dead Man's Chest factors in as it holds Mr. Jones' beating heart, which was ravaged by the likes of a lady whom he loved in the past. The English Navy blowhards also seem to be after the chest, and blackmail William Turner (Orlando Bloom) to seek out Capt. Jack's magic compass, which supposedly points toward the treasure. Held in a cell is Will's fiancé, Elizabeth Swan (Kiera Knightley), under charges of assisting Capt. Jack in the franchise's last swashbuckler. What it boils down to is a mottled mess of a chase to find the key to Davey Jones' chest, and avoiding his gargantuan beast, the Kraken. <br/><br/>The myth itself wrings deeper than the original's, with Davey Jones and his seafood cohorts rendered with an unholy amount of CGI goodness to make them squirm convincingly in all their scaly, slippery evil. But the plot doesn't hold much water, same as the first, though plot was never the point. As long as it paints a tastily mythological backdrop for our pirates to plunder, we're kept smiling. And even though the picture has all the weight of a paperclip, the franchise has at least matured since it's last time around. The mood has thickened and no longer can we tell that the film is a shameless translation of its Disneyland ride. Writers Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio take efforts to develop each of our three heroes separately, using individual sub-plots to fill in the otherwise empty molds left dry from the original. Will Turner has a family reunion with his father (Stellan Skarsgard), enslaved by Davy Jones and appearing as though he's slowly evolving into a starfish. Will's fiancé, Ms. Swan, escapes from her cell and hides as a stowaway on a trade vessel. And Jack, of course still functioning as the star of the show, develops his slimier persona with delectable cowardice and deception. Ironic that the teenagers of America have chosen Mr. Sparrow as their most prized character in film. Oh, wait, that honor instead belongs to Napoleon Dynamite. Perhaps we should be nervous about our country's future? <br/><br/>Anyway, along with the characters the adventure is also thickened heartily; though probably not by consequence of the writing, but instead because of the greatly inflated budget. Our friends are volleyed about the seas, facing the enormous sea monster, the Kraken, whose plunger-like tentacles crumple vessels like copy-paper. Swordplay is more indulgent too, with Verbinksi going so far as to mount a chivalric swordfight inside a huge, rolling waterwheel as it bounces along the island's foliage. Verbinski juggles these stunts with ease, proving once again his film-making versatility. If you'll remember all the way back to last October (I know, in Hollywood-time nine months is an epoch) Verbinski made a quiet, gloomy little character study called The Weather Man. And before that, Verbinski also directed The Ring and Captain Jack's first adventure in 2003. Yup, this guy's the real deal. In the waterwheel sequence, Verbinski chooses not to succumb to any mere CGI trickery, and mounts a camera on the wheel's axis to show that at one point he forced Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom to swordfight on a giant spinning wooden wheel. And he's more artistic than your typical Brett Ratner-esquire director, finding a visual aesthetic perfect for a pirate's tale. <br/><br/>But art and pretentious critic fodder aside, Dead Man's Chest is great entertainment. It's rich and exciting and chock-full of Captain Jack-isms for high schoolers to repeat over and again. And the life of pirates is still a chunk of history that Hollywood has been unwilling to bite into for a while. Pirates of the Caribbean, for all its feathery, lightweight fun, gorges on this chunk and keeps us hooked on the adventure, waiting along with all the local eighth and ninth graders next year for the midnight showing of Captain Jack's trilogy capper."
"I_Like_Turtle_s","9","377","628","6 July 2006"," More than equals its predecessor.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does the right thing as a sequel: It maintains the same carefree spirit of the original and creates an even more fitting story to the whole Pirates lore. After narrowly escaping the gallows--with the help of his friends Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)--and reclaiming his cursed Black Pearl, it still seems Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has a few more fish to fry. More specifically the barnacle-encrusted undead on board the ghostly Flying Dutchman, lead by Mr. Octopus Face himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Jack apparently owes a blood debt to the inky captain and if he can't find a way out of it--namely locating the secret contents of Jones' famed locker--Sparrow will be doomed to eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife (insert Jack Sparrow's face of disgust here). Making matters worse, Sparrow's problems manage to interfere with the wedding plans of Will and Elizabeth, who are forced to join Jack on yet another one of his misadventures.<br/><br/>Depp's Oscar-nominated performance as Captain Jack is still a marvel in slovenly pirate behavior, with his slurred speech, swaying swagger and slack, waving arms. But whether channeling famed Rolling Stones' guitarist Keith Richards or not, it's the duality of the character that continues to intrigue us. He is a lusty, fearless man with a deeply defiant and somewhat sneaky streak but whose delicate features, long, dread locked hair, Kohl-rimmed eyes and almost girly mannerisms give him a subtly effeminate air that belies his macho antics. This time around, young Brits Knightley and Bloom have a little more to do, with Elizabeth's growing attraction to Jack and Will's reunion with his father, Bill ""Bootstrap"" Turner (Stellan Skarsgård), who's soul is stuck on the Flying Dutchman. And Nighy (Love Actually) once again makes his mark as an effective villain, infusing his rather quirky acting ticks--the laconic delivery, the laid-back attitude--which shines through all the special effects make-up. Let's just say, Nighy certainly rivals Depp in the arrogant rock star stance, even if he has tentacles for a face.<br/><br/>The other thing Dead Man's Chest does right is make things bigger and better. From a hair-raising sword fight on top of a spinning water wheel to the way Davy Jones and his crew look--all water logged and crustacean-like--the film's production value is simply amazing. Returning producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski make sure the action sequences, the sets, the costumes, the make-up and the special effects give the audience a familiarity to the original while also taking them on a whole new adventure. And if you are a fan of the Disney park attraction (the one at Disneyland, not Disney World), the elements that got missed in the first one--the creepy bayou, the beating heart in the treasure chest--are in this sequel. Dead Man's Chest does lag a bit from time to time, especially in heating up the Jack, Elizabeth and Will love triangle. But that's OK. We enjoy watching their banter, as much as we do the rest of it. And for those who'll want more adventure after the movie ends, Dead Man's Chest gives us a promise the third installment will be just as much pirate fun.<br/><br/>9/10"
"musica1","10","255","424","8 July 2006"," Great summer fun! Everything I hoped for!
","I will make my comments without spoilers so that people who haven't yet seen the movie can read it.<br/><br/>One of the worst things that can happen in a sequel to a successful movie is that audiences will feel like they're seeing the same movie again with slight variations on the theme. Dead Man's Chest gives us all the characters we loved in the first movie, but puts them in a refreshingly original movie. The action sequences will keep you on the edge of your seat. And there are more laugh-out-loud moments in this movie than in most comedies. I felt entertained from the beginning right through to the special scene after the closing credits. In fact, I enjoyed it so much that I and my entire family will be going to see it again today.<br/><br/>For parents with young children: This movie is more violent than the first movie. There is a lot of killing, though none of it is shown close up or in a grisly manner. Davey Jones and his gang are very gross. In the screening I attended, there were a lot of ""Ewwww!""s from the audience. If you have sensitive young ones, you should probably leave them at home."
"robinpix","9","16","21","2 August 2006"," Loved the FIRST one and the SECOND is just as GREAT!

Don't miss the bonus scene at the end of the very long list of credits. Casting was brilliant and not a flaw anywhere. Left me excited about the third movie. Johnny Depp is fantastic! Depp deserves to be nominated for this role! The special affects and action scenes were exciting and showed tremendous thought and skill into the making of this movie.

If you liked Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, you're going to have to love this one too. Of course, Johnny Depp's acting is still wonderful as the last one, as well as Orlando Bloom's and Keira Knightley's. The effects are absolutely stunning and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I do suggest though, if you have not seen the first one, you need to see that before going to see this one..otherwise, you're going to be a ""tad"" clueless on some parts.

","Today was to be the wedding day of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner. But before the ceremony, the bride and groom are both arrested, by order of Lord Cutler Beckett. Elizabeth was clapped into jail, while Will was brought before Beckett. It seems they were incarcerated for aiding and abetting known pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow. And since Will and Jack were so close, Beckett decided to strike a deal. He tells Will to seek out Jack Sparrow and acquire his compass, in exchange for freedom. Meanwhile, Captain Sparrow is reunited with Joshamee Gibbs and the rest of his crew aboard the Black Pearl. They were now in search of the greatest treasure in the history of the sea: a chest belonging to Davy Jones himself. But first, they must find one very crucial instrument to aide them in their quest: the key to unlock the chest. Later that night, Jack meets a suspicious stowaway. It was none other than the mutated form of ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner, Will's lost father. Bill warns Jack of Davy Jones, as well as something far more deadly and dangerous...the biggest, nastiest, monster in the ocean: the Cracken.<br/><br/>After a long search, Will spies the Black Pearl aground on a tropical island. He goes ashore to investigate and finds Jack Sparrow had been taken in by a tribe of primitive warriors, who claim Jack is their god. Playing along, Jack has his men incarcerate Will into a hanging cage with the rest of his crew. It would appear Jack had it made, although he was unaware of the fate which was in store for him: the tribe was to release the god within by destroying his mortal exterior...Jack realized this by the time they tied him to a spit above what would soon be a roaring bonfire; Will, Gibbs and the rest of the men pool together to save themselves. It was a gracious effort, and a few men lost their lives, but finally they are free, and Jack also manages to free himself of his own dilemma, and after they reunite, climb aboard the Black Pearl and set sail, leaving behind a very angry and cheated tribe; Captain Jack wanted to continue his search for the key to Davy Jones' chest, so he seeks out his old, so-called friend: Tia Dalma. They find her in a secluded swamp. She tells them where to find the key: aboard Davy Jones' ship, The Flying Dutchman. So, they set out to find the Flying Dutchman, sticking to secluded waters, so as to avoid...The Cracken.<br/><br/>When they finally discover the Flying Dutchman, Will goes aboard alone to check it out first, when suddenly he's kidnapped by a motley crew of half-man, half-sea creatures, including ol' squid-head himself, Captain Davy Jones! It also seems Jack Sparrow has a debt with Jones that is yet to be settled: he owes him his soul. Jones tells Jack to bring him 99 additional souls so, while Will remains captive on the Dutchman, Jack, Gibbs and the Pearl crew venture to Tortuga, a seedy pirate hang out, to do some soul searching. Back on the Dutchman, Will is reunited with his father and, learns the secret of Davy Jones' chest: after a heart breaking relationship, Jones had actually cut out his heart and locked it into a chest. He who posses his heart can either kill Jones or control him. Will wanted to kill him, but Jack wanted the heart to control him; unbeknownst to the gang, Elizabeth had escaped from jail and had been following them the whole time; reunited, Will and Jack go after Davy Jones' chest. Unfortunately an old adversary of Jack's, Lord Norrington, was also after the chest, and so begins a three-way sword fight. Worse yet, Davy Jones and his gang of scurvy sea-dogs arrive too. Jack takes the key from Will, opens the chest and removes the heart. Norrington continues to battle Will and Jack and secretly swipes the heart, escapes Davy Jones and his crew, and delivers the heart to Lord Beckett! As for Davy Jones, he and his crew set sail aboard the Flying Dutchman with an empty chest; Jack, Will, Elizabeth and the Black Pearl crew set sail and soon find themselves wrapped in the tentacles of the hungry Cracken. They attempt to fight off the monster, but attempts proved futile. Elizabeth learned the monster was really after Jack, so she cuffs him to the mast and escapes with Will and the crew. As for Captain Jack Sparrow, he had put up a good fight, but in true hero fashion, he allowed himself, and the Pearl, to be taken... Will, Elizabeth, Gibbs and the crew lament over the loss of Jack and realize he was a decent man after all. They visit Tia Dalma again, who tells of a possible way to bring Jack back, but it would require sailing to the world's end. They were willing, so Dalma assigned a familiar captain to guide them. They couldn't believe who it was! To be continued...<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I think it was better than the first movie. It was funny and action-packed! Johnny Depp was fantastic as everybody's favorite fearless, poignant and naive pirate, Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom, great as Will. The incredibly sexy Keira Knightley shines as Elizabeth. We've also got Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, Jack Davenport as Norrington, and Stellan Skarsgard as Bootstrap Bill; Entertaining, funny, thrilling, but a tad violent for a Disney movie. It will make you greatly anticipate Pirates of the Caribbean 3, due next year. Will they be able to save Jack? And what of Davy Jones? Did Bootstrap Bill survive? So anyway, if you're looking for a swashbuckling, thrill ride to see this summer, then set sail with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest! I recommend it, mateys!"

"Fluffy_Poodle","1","94","156","13 July 2006"," Too Much CGI, Not Enough Captain Jack
","Let me start off by saying how much I loved the first PotC movie. I adored it. It's not on my list of favorite movies of all time, but I still adored it. Johnny Depp was brilliant, the story was fun, it was immensely entertaining, even Orlando Bloom didn't annoy me as much as he usually does. But this thing? People are comparing THIS to The Empire Strikes Back? THIS movie beat the records of Revenge of the Sith and Spiderman? Two movies that are actually GOOD? <br/><br/>Instead of comparing Dead Man's Chest to The Empire Strikes Back (my favorite movie of all time), I would compare it to Temple of Doom. It was nowhere near as good as the first movie and relied far too much on special effects and ""gross out"" moments. Disney made the mistake that studios often make when they have an extreme success with an action movie: they assumed it was the special effects that people liked, not the story or the characters. Where was my beloved Captain Jack? The movie was TWO AND A HALF hours long. You think they could have put him in it more, but no. His character was also rather one-dimensional in this film, having hardly any scruples for abandoning his friends and such. The plot was contrived and just plain dumb. Half the time I had no earthly idea what was going on. In fact, the friend I saw the movie with kept poking me in the arm and asking, ""Wait...what's happening?"" <br/><br/>And don't get me started on the villain. He was a freaking OCTOPUS. All the CGI they used for the various undead things looked so cheesy. They weren't frightening in the least. What about Davy Jones's motive? Why DID he want Captain Jack's soul so much? I was utterly confused.<br/><br/>Finally, what was UP with the whole romance between Elizabeth and Jack? What about Will? I know any woman in her right mind probably WOULD choose Johnny Depp over Orlando Bloom any day, but this makes the romance between Elizabeth and Will in the first movie pretty pointless. And their romance was most of the PLOT in the first movie.<br/><br/>So, basically, I hated this movie. It wasn't offensively bad, though, and not AS bad as Temple of Doom (what is?) I was laughing throughout the entire thing at its utter stupidity. Frankly, though, I would rather go be disappointed by X3 again.<br/><br/>Which is pretty sad."
"editor-299","6","86","142","29 June 2006"," 'Pirates' is visually stunning, but drifts due to convoluted plot
","Based on the massive popularity of the first installment, ""Piates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl,"" in 2003, it was only natural for a sequel to this Disney swashbuckler to make its way to theatres.<br/><br/>After an adequate amount of time, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"" starring most of the last movie's original cast, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightly, Jonathan Pryce, etc. has hit the big screen.<br/><br/>And while the visuals, special effects and sets are extraordinary, the film seems to drag on searching for coherence in a meandering plot line which drifts all over the South Seas. It's not that I did not like this picture, or enjoy certain parts immensely, it's simply another case of the first one being better, as well as easier to understand.<br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest"" picks up basically where the first left off, but Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightly) are arrested on Port Royale by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander, ""Pride & Prejudice,"" ""The Libertine""). The charge: Conspiring to aid in the escape of noted pirate, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Depp). The possible penalty: Death by hanging (the British answer to everything).<br/><br/>Cutler gives Turner an option, however. Find Sparrow and retrieve a certain key to a certain treasure chest, and all will be forgiven. Meanwhile, Sparrow and his motley crew have beached on a remote South Pacific island (thanks to Jack's non-functioning compass) inhabited by cannibals. While the crew is imprisoned in huge, round, wooden cages suspended from high cliffs, Sparrow is treated like a demigod.<br/><br/>After a series of goofy, but funny chases, the fun cannot last here, though, and with Turner's help, most of the men (and Jack) beat a hasty retreat from the venue. A side trip to visit what seems like a voodoo conjurer, Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris, ""A Cock & Bull Story""), sheds a little more light on things. A key such as Beckett described to Turner does indeed exist; and it opens the chest which contains the still-living heart of Davy Jones, the mythical sailor punished for all eternity for falling in love with a woman (or something to that effect).<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, the Black Pearl is overtaken by the ghostly Flying Dutchman, captained by none other than the squid-like Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy,"" ""The Constant Gardner""), and manned by a doomed crew now more fish and barnacle than man. Turner is kept on board while Jack, to pay off some debt to Jones, is sent to bring 100 souls to Jones as a ransom. On this ship, Turner also meets his doomed father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard, ""King Arthur,"" ""Exocist: The Beginning"").<br/><br/>Jones, who keeps the key on his slimy person, also has sway over a huge sea monster, the Kraken, which can destroy a vessel and its crew in a matter of moments. The special effects in these sequences are terrific.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Swann has stowed away aboard another ship, and convinces the captain to put in at the pirate port of Tortuga, where Sparrow is recruiting another crew, including the disgraced former Commodore James Norrington.<br/><br/>When she meets Jack, some sparks fly, but it's in her hands that the compass finally begins to lead the way to the ""dead man's chest."" It seems that each of the protagonists - Sparrow, Turner and Norrington - want Davy Jones' heart for themselves, and this sets off a hilarious three-way battle for the organ.<br/><br/>As expected, Depp is great in this role (although he seems a bit more spaced-out, or intoxicated most of the time), and there are some pretty good moments here (such as the triple sword-fight on a huge rolling water mill), if one can sit through the plot complications long enough to figure out what's going on. <br/><br/>The conclusion paves the way an obvious sequel (due for release in 2007), so that last picture may clear up some of the confusion from this one."

","If I hadn't spent $8 to get into the theater I would have left this movie about half way through. But I stayed, hoping it would eventually get better  no such luck. <br/><br/>I think Disney let their idea people get out of control. The movie just got too crowded with special effects and totally goofy plot twists, which eventually robbed a good cast of any opportunity to actually act. Davey Jones and his crew are so over-endowed with gimmicks squirming over their bodies that they ended up more being more distracting than entertaining. And why did the director need to get so focused on being as gross as possible? Instead of gratuitous sex Disney gives us gratuitous slime. Johnny Depp nibbling on a necklace made of human toes was something I didn't get; I didn't need it, and neither did the movie.<br/><br/>Compared to the first film, Dead Man's Chest was a let down. I can't think of any redeeming qualities, except maybe that it is making a few people a lot of money."

I did not have huge expectations as other fans may have, but I did at least want a quality movie.<br/><br/>Other users have pointed this out in their reviews. This movie is a complete setup for Pirates #3 and possibly #4. I refuse to see the sequels as I feel they made me waste 2.5 hours of my time and money to set up Pirates #3. All the users who praise the movie, I have no idea what you are talking about. Don't waste your time and money seeing this.<br/><br/>This movie has nothing original about it. They provide the exact same jokes and perspectives as the first one. In addition, they steal several ideas and scenes from other movies. It's so annoying, boring, and proves to be a failure. A couple of my friends fell asleep during the movie during the slow progression and overall stupidity of plot. The ending is completely painful. The movie just stops abruptly and the credits roll. You leave with the most horrendous taste in your mouth and most disgusted feeling (as anyone would feel after having wasted hours of their time and money to see basically a trailer)."

","It is usually a bad sign if a popcorn movie like this clocks in at well over two hours. the amazing thing about that running time is, that not a single plot point is resolved in this film. Everything that is brought into the movie as being there for our hero's to overcome, is still there when the credits roll those ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MINUTES finally end. Two and a half hours, just to set up a third movie? I'm sorry, but that has to be the biggest rip off since Manhatten and those beads and trinkets used to buy it.<br/><br/>To be sure the cast is still beautiful, (At least the leads are) and the action comes fast and furious, but it leads absolutely nowhere. The first movie was a complete film. There was a resolution at the end, and if there never had been a sequel made, it would not have affected what people thought of that movie one bit. This film requires you to see the unreleased (and let me add, not due to be released for almost another year.) Watching Johnny Depp act in these films is worth the price of admission, and its not a bad movie, just a pointless one. Personally I now know I could have saved my time and money, waited till next summer, and gone to the ACTUAL sequel, not this clumsy attempt to pad this into a five hour epic. Sheesh they were able to tell Gone With the Wind, Ben Hur, or Lawrence of Arabia in far less time then the five hours that these two movies will eventually need to resolve issues that everyone in the audience already knows the ending to."

The old characters are just as you remember them (with some changes in fortune for a couple), the new characters are wonderfully colorful and memorable, and the bad guys are delightfully evil and cunning. I loved the plot, I loved the way it played out. Jokes and snappy one-liners abound, just as witty as in the first. And, once again, Captain Jack Sparrow has one of the best introductions in movie history. The special effects were very good and everything looked realistic. The sword work was excellent, the fights both suspenseful and entertaining. And, there's a wonderful surprise at the end. If you want a movie that will make you think, this isn't really it. But, if you want a fun, entertaining movie that will take you away from reality for a little while, this is definitely the one for you. It's a great ride, and great fun."

The voodoo lady was hard to understand. I caught every other words she said. I'm sure I'll get all of the humor when I buys this DVD and play her section with the CC on! I didn't quite understand the reason behind the part of the movie with the tribal people other than it gave the movie more action scenes. That whole section could be removed and the movie would still flow well. I loved Commodore Norrington in the first movie. I was disappointed with what they did to him in the second movie. I hope he returns in all his glory for the 3rd Pirates movie.<br/><br/>I saw a few young children in the theater and was horrified to think that those young eyes saw some very scary and gruesome images.

"alexosborne80","1","55","95","10 July 2006"," I Would've waited for the DVD.
","AHOY SPOILERS......<br/><br/>Well i was a big fan of the original film and saw it multiple times in the cinema. The trailers for the new film were a little disappointing so helped not get my expectations too high but i still went to see dead mans chest with a fairly positive mind.<br/><br/>OH DEAR...... Now lets start what was good about the film as it is a much shorter list....well the GGI was really good. Davy Jones looked awesome and his henchmen also looked great. The escape from the Tribe was also quite funny.<br/><br/>Now onto the bad, well for starters the film didn't have the fun swash buckling feel too it, they went allot darker and for me this didn't work. In the first film the back stabbing had a humorous element to it, in this it felt cold and wrong. Also the humour was just repeat jokes from the first film. There were like 5 rum jokes in the film and only 2 of them were funny. There was hardly any original material, that made you laugh like the first film.<br/><br/>The film also feels like the first part of a longer film, which of course it is but it does not stand alone by itself as a good film. They cram so much story and plot into and none of it is paid off in this film. The cliff hanger at the end does not feel like a cliff hanger the film just stopped and even the ending was contrived. They should have done an Indiana Jones and done two separate films with two separate plots with the same cast.<br/><br/>Also the film felt very forced. Why 2 years after POTC would the Indian trading company only just decide to arrest will turner?? Why would they also want to arrest Commander Norrington for letting Jack go when Norrington apparently chased Jack Sparrow till he lost his crew?? Why the hell were the two pirates from the first film rowing a boat in the middle of the sea?? Why after escaping does Elizabeth go and see the Lord?? Why when her and will are reunited do they care about getting a pardon, they are both free why not go and live in china?? How the hell do they go and see the witch at the end without a boat?? why see the witch at the end at all?? EVen the set up for the next film was forced.<br/><br/>To me it feels like they had a whole load of sequences and gags planned and then they wrote a script around it. The editing was also really bad, one minute Jack is running away on the Black Pearl the next he is a Tribe leader and what the hell was will trying to do at the end with all of the dynamite and rum, yeah the plan worked but it should not have done.<br/><br/>If Pirates 3, is the best film ever then this film could be redeemed. As it stands at the moment it sucks big time and is pure filler. If you are a fan of the first film see this at your own risk."

","From Sinbad and the Seven Seas to Jason and the Argonauts; from Odysseus and his Odyssey to Sloth and his friends the Goonies, audiences all alike have been amazed and enamored by what tales are told and brought from the depths of the sea. For someone like Ernest Hemingway the sea may bring an overwhelming feeling of complete serenity, but in the eyes of both producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski all is too well known to let the sea rest that easily. And it's no more apparent than in the mind of one Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Captain Jack and his crew set sail, this time around, toward a course that'll lead them to an all-important chest, that only Jack knows the meaning of. The content within that chest happens to tell the sad story of one Davey Jones and his lost lady of the sea. But in order for Jack to get to the heart of things, so to speak, he must enlist the unwilling help of both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, yet again. With their assistance not only does Jack learn a valuable lesson in doing the right thing, but Jack ends up, unintentionally, leading both Elizabeth and Will down a path to their deepest desires.<br/><br/>Along the way mischievous antics occur, which is likely in a movie as swashbuckling fun as a Monty Python sketch (in fact, at any moment you might expect to hear the faint sounds of two coconuts clip-clopping together). That's not to say that they weren't on a treacherous trail of danger either. There's indeed a fair share of monstrous feats and ghastly turmoil. I'm mainly referring to Davey Jones' main defense, the Kraken (after seeing it, one might reconsider their decision to ever order Calamari again). And as exciting as the Kraken was to watch, the fight sequences were just as eye-popping. However, when you think that there couldn't be any more surprises there's just one more in store. But in the manner of a great magician, a good film-goer never ruins the ending. All that can be said is that the third installment has a lot to live up to.<br/><br/>Nothing can go wrong with a cast as energetic and enlightening as this one. Johnny Depp's portrayal of a pirate who thrives on near misses matches up perfectly with Kiera Knightley's role of a thrill seeker of a woman (which is just as enchanting as ever). Even Orlando Bloom pulls his own weight in this film filled with spectacles of great magnitude (it's as if they're all hungry to play with fire again). With the new edition of Bill Nighy (who's totally unrecognizable, yet refreshingly evil, as Davey Jones) and a bigger chunk of a part for Stellan Skarsgård to bite into as Will Turner's father, an astonishing experience for any film-goer is ensured. But not everyone may feel the same way, for one might find it hard to take the over-the-top locations and its acting another go around. Nevertheless, one man's jar of dirt is another's jar of gold.<br/><br/>The reason why this trilogy will work, after having so much retrospection on the subject, is the very same reason why the Indiana Jones franchise (as well as the original Star Wars) worked so well. It's just too good to be true. And don't think of this movie as being better than the original, think of it as aiding in the continuation of a wonderful story and its intriguing characters. So, without any further ado, set sail and point your compass wherever your deepest infatuations take you. All the knowledge that is needed to go forward without any trouble at all, at least for a little while, is to stay starboard and afloat for as long as you can. Other than that, just keep on singing, ""Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate's life for me."""

","I thought this movie was excellent! It revived the wonderful characters of Captain Jack, Elizabeth, and Will, but brought more into the mix! Before you condemn this movie (I have already read the many comments posted about it below), you must see the first POTC to truly appreciate this one. Next, you must keep in mind that it is intended to go hand in hand with POTC 3. Finally, you should truly like the movie. If you simply thought the first one was OK or technically OK but the plot stunk or whatever, you will likely not appreciate this movie because you have no real attachment to it. There are many supposed classic movies that ""everyone should see"" that I detest because I personally cannot get into them. I am not putting this movie on the same level as those, but the same principal follows it. This movie contains a lot of action and drama and I think it will be nicely rounded out by POTC 3...that is part of the reason some of you whiners complain that it has no plot. On the contrary, it has a very clear plot, but the storyline cannot be completed until the third and final installment."

As with #1, this movie was not totally predictable, although I expected it to be so. A bit more violence, but less viewable so that does not change my thought to take the younger ones (probably 9-10 & up).

Depp has Sparrow nailed to a perfect part. While Bloom is not as good, the part he plays in the film is very important. Everyone does a very good job at their part, especially Mr. Gibbs (who seems to be the pirate narrator for those of us who do not know about things such as the Kracken). <br/><br/>I would say that if you go to see one movie at all this summer, you should see Pirates:Dead Man's Chest. The CGI is incredible. Davy Jones is the best bad guy since Vader. Depp is a perfect Han Solo match and Knightly has the sass of Leia. I think that anyone who does not feel impressed with this film did not understand what they were going to see; a sequel to a fun, summer, popcorn movie with scary effects, interesting twists, and many surprises. Time your bathroom breaks, or don't have them at all. The first part of the film is the only place I would ever go back to the restroom.

Jack Sparrow's character was changed from a crooked good man to. . . I don't even know. His character was extremely shallow and humorless. It felt as though a two year old designed his character.

","******* Contains Spoilers***********<br/><br/>Truly one of the worst A movies I have ever seen. I have not walked out of a movie since ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" at a college movie night in 1977 but I did tonight. What a horrible, boring, interminably long mess! I sat there for most of the film wishing that someone would make the bad writers go away.<br/><br/>The plot line seems to have been conceived along the lines of ""hmm, we have three villains but it doesn't seem to be working, how about if we add a few more, yeah, thats the ticket."" Then, when it appears that the large villain count isn't working, we have to throw in some cannibals and a giant squid just to make sure there is enough villainy for all the 7th graders at which this film appears to be aimed.<br/><br/>After two hours my wife and I got up and left. We couldn't stand the boredom. It is insufferably long, bereft of a meaningful plot arc, overly violent for no apparent reason than to appease the aforementioned junior highers, and leaves the viewer with fewer brain cells than he or she walked in with.<br/><br/>To be sure, the film is beautiful to look at, the special effects masterful, the makeup superb, but the acting is average (with Depp failing to supersede his marginal performance in the first PoftheC) and the screenplay gets a solid F. The film looks like it was produced by someone who invested a lot in action sequences and couldn't bear to cut them down despite their debilitating effect on the overall effort. <br/><br/>Three glaring examples come to mind: some of our heros are imprisoned in a sphere made of bones and, despite the fact that the holes in the spheres were big enough for Kirstie Alley to escape through, we had to spend an insufferable amount of time watching our heros bounce down hills inside the sphere, climb up hills in the sphere, walk across fields (ala Fred Flintstone getting his car to start) in the sphere, fall down canyons in the sphere, and so on. If we hadn't seen enough of rolling set pieces with people stuck in them, later in the movie we get even more when another group of protagonists (or are they antagonists? one can never tell) rolls a giant waterwheel down hills, over fields, through jungles, across the water, etc., etc., etc. The producers want us to know that this wheel is not CG so they shoot it from every angle possible including a bunch of ridiculous tracking shots that have the camera rotating as the wheel rotates!! In another scene, the three pro/antagonists have a stupidly long and ludicrous three way sword fight while the damsel in distress tries unsuccessfully to get their attention (and while ignoring the hugely valuable treasure that is stolen out from under her nose). All this while being chased by undead fish people.<br/><br/>It goes on and on. This is one of those films that could have been a lot of fun but wasn't quite fun enough for the test audiences so the producers decided to add more fun until finally it is so darn fun that you fall asleep in the middle from the sheer load of tortuous unending fun that washes over you.<br/><br/>This film may have appealed to some but if you are looking for a good swashbuckler with a great villain and a tight plot line, look elsewhere, this ain't it."

","""Dead Man's Chest"" does not have the strong hook in the initial 10 minutes that ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" did. I wanted to see Will and Elizabeth preparing for their nuptials, the guests being seated, the musicians playing.... It just seemed like some footage was cut for running length that might have built a more emotional response to Will in irons and wet wedding music on a stand and a soaked bride with no father present. I also found the EIT company gentleman arriving in a small boat while mounted on a horse odd. Was this actually done in history? Given wave action, I should think the horse would have a hard time balancing--especially in such a small boat--and anyone sitting astride would be in risk of a dump in the drink. Incroyable! Given those reservations, DMC does provide an escape from the summer heat or the world and its current woes. It is darker and creepier, but what isn't these days? Red herrings fly in every direction, setting up the sequel. Johnny Depp has Jack running between raindrops and playing everyone off everyone else. Of course, things have to catch up with Jack. We are told what will happen at the beginning. No surprise when it does--although the manner has a twist. However, since Jack wisely palmed a piece of Aztec gold before fighting Barbossa, it is not surprising that he has managed to collect a couple items in Tia's home while there. He's ready for anything. Including the sequel.<br/><br/>I found myself wanting to see more of Will Turner in DMC. He moves the action along, has a few tender/dramatic moments (the best being his vow to his father), and one of the funniest scenes when he tries to charge out of the mill wheel, sword in hand, and doesn't quite. Interesting that he does not press Elizabeth about what he saw as they fled the Pearl. Since he is called ""a man of destiny"" by Tia, I have a feeling that PC 3 will have more Will Turner, Jr.<br/><br/>Elizabeth has a much larger role this go-round than Will, it seems. Her chemistry with Jack is tangible and convincing. Nicely done by Ms. Knightly and Mr. Depp. She, too, plays people off each other, using them. Pirate, indeed. But didn't she steal Will's medallion right off? Bill Nighy and/or CGI managed to make Davy Jones' octopus-type head expressive with just his eyes showing. I'm sure we will learn how Davy sustained and survived his coronary bypass in the sequel--and who the mystery woman is who drove him to be the devil of the sea. Someone with a matching music box, perhaps? Maybe another herring.<br/><br/>I do hope the sequel will rescue Jack, the elder Mr. Turner, the Governor, and the dog, and bring back Murtog and companion. Surely the world will still be here next summer and ready for another Pirates diversion. The cast and crew and production staff must have toiled hard to produce PC 2 in various locations through one of the worst hurricane seasons we've had in recent years. Thank you for your efforts."

","Hollywood and numerous other places in which they make big fat expensive action/adventure thriller type films... are usually very lazy. They usually put in a hell of a lot of money, they may throw in some very good-looking actors, probably some expensive things like muscle cars (The Fast and The Furious), some really good looking girls, explosions, bad one-liners, POP CULTURE REFERENCES AND MAYBE EVEN SOME POINTLESS CAMEO APPEARANCES, bad dialog and a really uninteresting or boring plot... if not no plot at all. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is not one of those films... IT'S A MASTERPIECE!!! I was a huge fan or the original and own it on DVD. I have watched it many times over. The performance of Johnny Depp earned him an Acadmedy Award nomination and knowing this man I can honestly say right now that he without a doubt the greatest American actor of all time! I mean... sometimes you can hardly tell that its Johnny Depp because he gets to into this character of the legendary Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are good in their roles but of course they are overshadowed by Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy. Davy Jones is a complex, dark and very original kind of movie villain and one of the best I have seen in a long time. The plot is very original, the action sequences done extremely well and the loads of money put into such a production hasn't gone to waste... every cent has been put into good use. This is ""THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK"" or the modern age... and I am without a doubt not the very first person to say such a thing!"
"aladdinsfan","1","117","226","7 July 2006"," They didn't need a sequel
","When I saw the teaser trailer last summer, I thought, ""But the first one didn't leave room for a sequel. They didn't need one."" But being a big fan of the movie, I was still excited to see all the characters in another movie with hopefully the same intertwining plot lines and great actors. I was wrong. Sure, the actors are great, and they're all the original ones. But they might as well have not been. This sequel doesn't even compare to the first. Imagine seeing a commercial for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The TV Series!"" and mix up all the episodes and Dead Man's chest is what you've got. A very shrimpy plot line that doesn't stand out among all the other garbage that happens. For those of you who had seen it-- I'm not even talking about the thing about which you probably think I'm angry. That was one of the high points, among two other high action sequences. But it really feels like a bunch of fans sat around together and said ""Wouldn't be funny if .... wouldn't it be dramatic if ..."", got the money to make a movie and they did.<br/><br/>Leave it to the fanfiction writers to write sequels to carry on the stories by adding stupid dramatic plot twists that didn't even exist in the first one. Just leave the good movies alone!"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","7","9","3 August 2008"," Pirates, Squid/Fishfaces, Kraken And A Dead Man's Chest
","The first time I saw 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest', I disliked it so much that I didn't bother finishing. However, something motivated me to give it another chance and surprisingly I enjoyed it. It is quite well executed. The action sequences and stunts are brilliantly choreographed. My favourite one was the three-way sword fight that continued through a spinning wheel. I liked that the director used minimal CGI for these scenes. The cinematography is stunning and the exotic landscape is breathtaking.<br/><br/>The actors do a fairly good job of reprising their role. It's great to see Johnny Depp again as Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is quite alright but his chemistry with Keira Knightley appears to be weaker than in the first movie. Knightley does an okay job too. Jack Davenport is a surprise to watch in a different gettup. Bill Nighy is great as the squid-faced villain and Naomie Harris is convincing as the witch with the Jamaican accent. The rest of the cast are adequate.<br/><br/>The dialogues are funny and witty and the comedy works but at times, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' felt more like a repetition than a continuation of 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'. The CGI, particularly on Davy Jones and his crew looked poor when compared to that used in Peter Jackson's 'King Kong' (the kind which would have excellently worked for this movie). The ending is unintentionally funny and seems very rushed. Not to mention, it's continuous (a cliffhanger ending) so the third one better be good.<br/><br/>For me, what stood out more about this movie than the first one were the amazing outdoorsy locations and the action scenes. It's quite a good sequel and very entertaining. Hopefully, the third one properly rounds up the trilogy and not end up like the disastrous 'X-Men'."
"Doddi","10","15","23","27 July 2006"," On the way to becoming one of the greatest trilogies!
","Pirates of the Caribbean:The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my favorite movies - it introduced me (and few other people in the world) to a certain Captain Jack Sparrow. What a beloved character he has become and Depp is perfect in this role. All is well that ends well, and movie no. 1 was a unique masterpiece.<br/><br/>Here, however, one immediately starts to think of the original Star Wars trilogy or even Back to the Future, Matrix ... etc. Not because of any reference (although one can easily do so), but because this film is a true example of a great trilogy in the making. I am at awe, truly. Everything in this film is perfectly done, but the only negative side is that I have to wait until next summer for the final chapter to appear. If I would break it down a little, I would do it like this:<br/><br/>Costumes: perfectly done. I haven't seen that many pirate movies but I have a feeling how a pirate should dress, and here the costumes are flawless.<br/><br/>Music: Always an important factor for me. And I loved Badelt's score in the first one, but Zimmer takes it further and with familiar references to Badelt once in a while. Awesome!<br/><br/>Script: Without giving to much, I think the scriptwriters have done an amazing job, I loved the dialog, I loved the scenes and interactions and I loved the ending - that's all I can say!<br/><br/>Visual effects: Flawless, yet again. The Kraken is without a doubt one of the best cgi characters I've seen. And of course Davy Jones's face! and other sea-creatures and the cursed crew of the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>Acting: Depp is hilariously great and awesome, Bloom and Knightley improve a lot, Bill Nighy is fun and of course the smaller parts are all cleverly cast and wonderfully executed.<br/><br/>Action: One of the best I've seen! The turning-wheel sword fight (don't worry - this has been seen in trailers so I'm not giving anything away) ... pure magic and skillfully done. And other action is great!<br/><br/>Direction: Verbinski is a master at work here, no doubt about it.<br/><br/>With this in mind, I think it's gonna be hard to top this one. The final chapter is gonna be awesome, but until I get to see it (with the rest of the world) these two films are gonna entertain me very much.<br/><br/>To sum it up in few words: The Greatest Entertainment you can find this year! Savvy?"
"Aezuriel","10","49","89","6 July 2006"," Can a sequel be better?
","Why is it that sequels are almost never better than the films that preceded them? Usually, it is because the characters and story of the original work, have already been explored, leaving little room for further conflict and development. Often, sequels are shadowed copies of the original work, barely giving a face-lift to familiar gags and material  with little of quality left to build a good framework for a story. Also, many films which seemed good enough to coerce people into continuing their investment of interest are groundbreaking in some fashionleaving any sequel an unfair amount of expectation to duplicate.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>The movie begins on the wedding day of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Cold and rainy, however, you wonder if it is meant more as a funeral. English soldiers march through Port Royal, and it almost seems cliché that Turner is to be arrested rather than married. Almost by accident, and before you get too wrapped up in the cliché, Elizabeth Swan is arrested as well -- all by a new member to the cast, Tom Hollander as Lord Cutler Beckett. Commodore Norrington is to be arrested as well, except that he's resigned his commission already and disappeared for reasons unknown. All this, because our hapless love triangle aided in the escape of one Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Lord Becket is not what he first seems, however. His ambitions (and loyalty) lie more to the East India Trading Company than to the crown of England. His purpose in Port Royal is simple: Find Jack Sparrow and recover something he stole from the East India Trading Company before the first film took place.<br/><br/>So he offers to release Turner in exchange for his services in finding (Captain) Jack. Wheels turn, and before long, you have witnessed the re-creation of half-a-dozen or so gags from the first film, and begun to wonder just where this all is supposed to go. Sadly it seems we are destined for a poor illusion to the Curse of the Black Pearlonly a little stranger.<br/><br/>And, that's just what they want you to think.<br/><br/>While you are about to give up, the film changes tack and forces you to seriously reconsider what you think you know about the original cast of heroes. Not to mention, what you already thought you knew about the few new characters you've met. Before you realize it, you are deeply engrossed in a sinister plot swing, feeding into the darker motives of our protagonists, trying to figure out which way is up. How did that happen? Suddenly, you begin to wonder ""Could this actually be good?"" The Answer is yes Not just good Absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>Period.<br/><br/>Somehow, you find the memories of The Curse Black Pearl fading away to be replaced by a stunning and original work rife with intrigue, humor - both subtle and plain, and a captivating blend of story and action which blows the original film out of the water. Plot-twist after plot-twist, the film never seems to run out of surprises, both malicious and benign. By the end, you will find yourself wondering, ""Can Captain Jack beat the Devil himself?"" Dead Man's Chest does not simply just represent a well made swashbuckling/action movie. It redefines the genre, giving us the first signs of an epic. Best of all, while it deepens your involvement in the conflict, you need not see the original to enjoy this film. This film is a masterwork, all on its own.<br/><br/>I cannot begin to express how surprised I was at my own reaction to this movie.<br/><br/>I expected to enjoy Dead Man's Chest. After all I am a fan-boy for the first film (and the genre). But overall, I am absolutely dumbfounded on how pristinely well crafted the entire picture was. Right down to the organ music during the credits.<br/><br/>This film has Flair.<br/><br/>It has witty Repartee.<br/><br/>It has Panache.<br/><br/>I have no doubt it will go down as one of the best films of all time.<br/><br/>And you know whatthere is still another sequel to come.<br/><br/> I expect this movie will be breaking world records. If you are even fathoming whether or not to see it, get your Tickets NOW. It is not often that a sequel surpasses the original work. I expect will exceed your expectations as well.<br/><br/>It is no accident that Disney put their official Logo back onto the head of this picture. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest will be selling out for weeks, and it fully deserves the credit."
"palsy-1","1","23","38","6 August 2006"," This movie has had its heart ripped out, much like Davy Jones
","Okay, I made a previous comment praising this movie in the sense of good spirit because I liked the actors and their performances even though I horribly dread it compared to Curse of the Black Pearl. However, now that I have indulged myself in metaphorical rum, I have come to realize that I was way too forgiving of this movie. <br/><br/>Firstly, the flaws in the content were abysmal: The plot was overloaded with action, devoid of all the quaint, understated humor of the original (ex: ""why is the rum gone?""). This movie has had its heart ripped out, much like Davy Jones. If you enjoy action heavy movies, by all means go see Dead Man's Chest. However, if you repeatedly watch Curse of the Black Pearl for nostalgia's sake and miss the subtle humor and small production feel, you will cry with agony 10 minutes into this movie. This movie takes itself way too seriously. <br/><br/>Secondly, the only thing that redeems this movie while simultaneously condemning it is that all the glitz distracts you from the picture's lack of soul. To the special effects team, photo-real animation can be distracting when used too much! CG effects in general can be a distraction when used too much. This is a prime example of special effects gone wrong! In fact, the movie is so weighed down by its special effects that the actors don't get a chance to act (hence lack of soul). I don't blame the actors, because they did a brilliant job on The Curse of the Black Pearl so I believe they know their stuff. <br/><br/>Thirdly, I felt the time slip through my fingers. After 2.5 hours of my life that I will never get back, I walked out of the theatre with a gigantic headache. Too many motives/ sub-plots! Arrg. Will vs his father vs Davy Jones, the Commadore vs Will, Will vs Jack, Jack vs Davy Jones vs The East India Company vs Elizabeth! What ever happened to plot line 101? The protagonist-antagonist ratio is on overload. The whole confusing mess comes to an apex when the Commadore, Jack, Will, Elizabeth, and Davy Jone's crew fight ALL at once on the island where Davy Jone's heart is buried. Not only does it give you a headache to watch, but because of all the diverging plot lines, nothing gets resolved. Annoying. <br/><br/>I will conclude with this. I am going to see Pirates 3 because I still enjoyed Captain Jack Sparrow and his smart, witty exchanges with Ms. Elizabeth. I am determined to see what becomes of their relationship. But more importantly I hope Jerry Bruckheimer can fix what he broke... the hearts of Pirates fans everywhere. However, because the crew shot some of Pirates 3 (w/o a script) while still filming Dead Man's Chest, I think things are off to a shaky start. Jumping the gun to save money is economically savvy but not too wise with all these summer half-baked movies. First I was commandeered onto the X3 (shoot me now) band wagon, and now something worse? Still, I hold out hope. Until then I will dive into the metaphorical bottle of rum.<br/><br/>""We're devils, we're black sheep, and really bad eggs. Drink up me hearties, yo ho!"""
"victoria-gunter","1","87","167","7 July 2006"," everything about this movie is bad. everything.
","Terrible, terrible movie. I'm not quite sure why so many people gave it a 10, were they entranced by the name of the movie ... or passed out after the first 5 minutes... or is it simply that they were preoccupied thinking up the fan-fiction they were going to write upon their return home? I mean honestly, this movie was just poorly done. They dropped the ball hard here. First of all, it needs some serious editing, it was far too long, and needlessly so. The fight sequences were repetitive and I hardly saw any swashbuckling! Next, can we get a little more imagination in the writing please? How many times are they going to repeat the same rum joke?!?!<br/><br/>I was considering giving the movie a 2 or maybe even a 3 due to the great visual effects, but topped with the terrible story, awful writing, poor score, and pretty much ruining the first one for me, I just couldn't bring myself to do it."
"one_letter","6","100","194","5 July 2006"," I loved it but this review might seem a little harsh
","Well, I've seen it. I like to call myself one of POTC's biggest New Zealand fans, but I am going to be as honest as I can. So this is my first impression. In the first ten minutes my thoughts were, well, this is a bit dark and bleak. The very first opening scene shows a right royal set of teacups being drenched by rain. Very dismal and eerie. Then we get a close up on Elizabeth sitting in the rain with the most depressed look on her face, surrounding her are the ruins of the wedding. Several bleak scenes later we have been introduced to Lord Beckett and the lives of Will and Elizabeth are in shaky hands. We shift to Gibbs singing, 'fifteen men on a dead man's chest' looking out upon a rather frightening fortress. Then we are re-introduced to Jack Sparrow, who is escaping this fortress. This intro is nothing compared to Jack's original entrance in POTC1 but it still is rather amusing. There are a few sharp, graphic, jabbing images throughout this but luckily, at this point the movie seems to take a turn (thank goodness, several young children next to me looked scared to death). We learn of Beckett's task he has given Will and Will meets up with Jack and his Crew on the cannibal island. I really enjoyed this part of the movie, some of the close-up, special effect shoots were a bit cheesy but we saw Captain Jack doing what he does best, escaping.<br/><br/>The movie progresses, I won't tell you much more but to say Davy Jones was excellent, Norrington was a surprise (I wish they had given him more screen-time), Elizabeth's little tantrum on the beach was rather funny but a little too over the top, Tia Dalma was great but I think she could have been so much more. And lastly we have the ending. It was Great. That Elizabeth Swann, my, my, my..I was actually quite surprised the writers decided to let Will witness that little...um...peck (?) at the end. I also didn't consider the fact that throughout the whole movie, when Elizabeth had Jack's compass, it didn't always point to Will and the chest?!??! That's definitely something to ponder about. The final scene is at Tia Dalma's shack were everyone is feeling numb with disbelief. Suddenly everyone is agreeing to 'sail to de end of de eart and beyond' and we meet the captain for that voyage. A man most of us never expected to see again. That final shot of Barbossa munching on his apple, grinning at everyone's shocked faces was awesome. All in all.umm..it was different, fresher, darker than the first. I also thought it was a little forced. Filming the first movie, they had no idea how much of a hit it would be. This time around they did. They had the money for all the big over the top special effects and they also, well, so it seemed, tried to make Jack Sparrow entertaining. What worked last time was the fact they wrote it with no idea how Johnny Depp would interpret it, this time they did. It just seemed like everything in the movie was the crew trying to hard. But I think I loved it none-the-less. Most of this I've written is me being picky, I think the only thing I truly disliked were some of the special effects shots, not the computer generated stuff but some of the others. Was it as good as the first movie? Yes it was, but in a different sense. They both have the same characters but they are both very different to each other. Was I disappointed when I left the cinema? After months of anticipation, was I disappointed? No, thankfully not. Expect to see me watching it again, and again over the next few weeks."
"andrej-zupanic","6","16","25","8 August 2006"," A must see for all adventure freaks!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","Three years after the first installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, Jerry Bruckheimer and Gore Verbinski did it again. They have created a two and half hour long hilarious and action packed adventure that will really hold you on the edge of your seat. This film has it all, action, comedy, adventure, fantasy, big and evil monsters that look really scary and of course a great cast of actors, such as Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce and many others.<br/><br/>The visual effects are fantastic and almost flawless, but from time to time there are a few visible mistakes, but you can see them only, if you concentrate on that. Otherwise they are the best I have seen lately in all films with CGI effects.<br/><br/>As for the story, it is very interesting and it is seen that the screenwriters were trying to get the best out of it, but they didn't correct all the mistakes, so the plot might be in some scenes a little less developed than in the others, but thank God that Gore and Johnny know how to make things right.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is again the bright light of this film. His performance is more than fantastic. I can't even find the word to describe it. Everything he does is pure magic and he really helps you to take the ride of your life throughout the whole film. This is most certainly his best performance ever, although he has created many different characters in his career, Jack Sparrow is his most complex and strangest creation.<br/><br/>Even Gore Verbinski has developed his skills in the last ten years. From Mousehunt to this film he had many rises and falls and he learned from the mistakes he made and now he delivers us one of this year's greatest masterpieces.<br/><br/>And Bill Highy as Davy Jones. This was most obvious a really good decision from the creators. You will most certainly remember him best from the first Underworld film, where he was playing Victor, a very strong and evil vampire. As Davy Jones he is even better. He is more evil and even more powerful and with the Kraken at his hand he really is one of the most recognizable villains in the movie history and a pretty damn good character.<br/><br/>All in all, Dead Man's Chest is a real Blockbuster that will put you on the edge of your seat and it won't let you go till the end. But with an open ending it will really make you to see the third part. This really is a must see for all adventure freaks and is wort every single penny you pay for the ticket. One of Jerry Bruckheimer's finest films with a great entertaining value."
"johnterrell2112","10","16","25","3 August 2006"," Much Better Than Anticipated
","When I went to see The Dead Man's Chest on opening night, my anticipation was quite high. I have been awaiting this film for over a year, and I cannot wait until the third movie comes out next May. Johnny Depp once again blows me away with the believability of Captian Jack Sparrow. When approached by Davy Jones, you can truly believe that Depp is at his wits end with desperation. When Depp faces the Kracken, you can see that he has reached a point where he cannot take it anymore and perhaps truly wishes for his ultimate demise.<br/><br/>At the end, when everyone is mourning the death of Captian Jack Sparrow and Barbossa walks into the room with the undead monkey Jack on his shoulder, my jaw hit the floor in shock. I mean, didn't he die by a musket ball to the chest at the end of the first film? I am eager to hear the explanation to that one.<br/><br/>All in all, I was very pleased with this sequel when so many sequels lately are nothing but a two hour waste of time."

","This is by far one of the best sequels out there. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I know that some reviewers have said that it's too long at 2 hrs and 30 min. I say how can you never have too much action. All the characters are explored a little deeper as well as some questions being answered. The Location in the Grenadines was spectacular as were the special effects! Although different from the Pearl the effects were just as exceptional! You do need to pay attention to the dialog very close in some parts because it is difficult to make out. There were as many twist , turns and surprises as there were course changes in the ships directions. Speaking of the ships, the Flying Dutchman looked pretty menacing. The Pearl was as sleek as ever and appeared to have changed just slightly from the first movie. Wehter you root for the Pirates or root for the ""other guys"" you will have a great adventure.

","This one goes in the 'what were they thinking' pile.<br/><br/>This was so disappointing that it prompted me to write my first ever review of any movie I've ever seen. Yes, that bad.<br/><br/>Too long, tortuous story, clichÃ© ridden, not very well acted, very badly cut, with some of the most awful digital work I've ever seen. Orlando Bloom is as bad and annoying here as he was in Troy (No small feat), the rest of the cast isn't really believing it themselves. The rhythm and tone are off most of the time. I knew it right away, something felt off in the first five minutes. My wife and I looked at each other and said in sync: 'Oh no!' It got worse from there. It's hard to say if it's the writing or the direction, but nothing quite runs well. It feels like a car running on three cylinders most of the time. It runs, but it's unpleasant to witness.<br/><br/>I don't get it. The first one was so enchanting and fun. What happened?<br/><br/>On the plus side, Depp still manages to come out on top repeating his performance from #1. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking at times and the special effects for Davy Jones' character are absolutely remarkable.<br/><br/>Ask yourself: how many scenes of a giant calamari slowly crushing sailboats can you stand before you start thinking of something else?<br/><br/>I had the same feeling coming out of there as I had when I came out of Waterworld: How does one ruin such a great premise?<br/><br/>Grrrr."

The special effects were realistic, and the story was unexpected and had a slightly irritating ending, but it was still effective. The soundtrack was awesome-I can't stop listening to it! Hans Zimmer is a genius. Overall, I thought the film was the best I have seen in ages. Pirates 3 is something to definitely look forward to. However, I would hesitate to recommend those who aren't big fans of the first film. You have to love Captain Jack and Pirates 1's cursed pirates to love Pirates 2. Which I obviously do."
"pinchedong","1","71","135","14 July 2006"," One of the worst films I've ever seen
","A day before I went to see it myself, a friend of mine warned me not to go. I went anyway, because I figured the first Pirates of the Caribbean was actually an enjoyable film. I wish I had listened to his advice.<br/><br/>By the time we hit the 2 hour mark, I was thinking to myself: ""This could have been over a half hour ago and I could be banging my head against the wall and having more fun."" The plot was ridiculous, even by Hollywood standards. For example: ""Let's see, Will Turner will strike a deal with a diminutive bad guy in order to save his future wife, who ends up escaping anyway."" There was no real character development, or even any sort of resolution.<br/><br/>The last hour or so of the film featured a giant octopus eating a ship for the third time, a long drawn out and boring sword fight rolled into a chase scene, neither of which were entertaining and an ending that offered no resolution to the film and actually felt like a slap in the face.<br/><br/>After the film was finished, my friends and I sat in our seats in disbelief as we felt robbed of not only our $6.50 but our dignity after being tricked into watching a 150-minute long trailer for the next installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. We didn't even sit there long, but we were the last people to leave the theater. It seemed to me that no one there really enjoyed the film enough to sit around through the credits and talk about how much they enjoyed the film. This observation was confirmed on our way out by the overwhelming number of downtrodden faces and lack of smiles among the crowd in the theater lobby.<br/><br/>If I could give this film a 0/10 I would."

","(MAJOR spoilers.) <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean. Dead Man's Chest. <br/><br/>It was full of jokes, some were good, and pirates. Which was about it. It didn't seem to have a real story developed behind it. From what I gathered, Capt Jack Sparrow owes Davey Jones a favour. After a few minutes, the infamous Sparrow finally comes! You'd think he'd be the first character introduced, but it actually started with a rainy, glum day, which looks like Elizabeth Swan and William Turner's wedding. Except it didn't really happen. Anyway, back to Sparrow. He goes down to the bottom of the ship, searching for rum, muttering, ""The rum is always gone,"" and in the corner it's...BOOTSTRAP BILL! He's covered in barnacles and gives the Black Spot whenever he touches someone. It's quite funny to watch an undead Turner covered in barnacles chatting it up with Sparrow. Maybe I have a bad sense of humour. Bootstrap boards the Flying Dutchman is some undisclosed scenes.<br/><br/>FORWARD.<br/><br/>William has to get the compass from Sparrow to save Elizabeth from jail. It turns out they got arrested for trying to free a pirate. So, he finds Sparrow as the newly-instated chief of a tribe that speaks a very entertaining language. He, Sparrow, has really cool makeup on that makes him look like he has eyes on his eyelids and three sets of eyes on his cheeks. Anyway, William gets caught sneaking around the island and is captured. William is trying to get Sparrow to tell the natives to free him, but Sparrow, of course, doesn't bother and actually eggs the natives on. Quite funny, William Turner being tied to a huge stalk of bamboo being roasted. But, with his pirate instincts, Sparrow tells the natives to get a bigger log for a bigger ""fi-fi! (fire)"", and while doing so, Sparrow (alone) and Turner (?) escape. But after a while and confusing scenes, Sparrow is caught escaping and his tied to wood and is put over a fire. Comically trying to blow out the fire from five feet away, the fire spreads. But he gets down. All is well for him.<br/><br/>FORWARD.<br/><br/>So, it turns out that William finds out his dad is alive! REUNION. There's an awkward relationship between the two, mainly due to Orlando Bloom. It's quite funny: Bootstrap's white make up, progressively during the movie, comes off from around his eyes and you can see his skin. Very distracting. So, William hops aboard the Flying Dutchman, chatting it up with his undead father. Then, William needs to get a key from Davey Jones to open a chest to destroy the heart within. Bootstrap and William play a game of dice, or something, against Davey Jones, and lose. Bootstrap ruined it. So he, William, can't destroy the heart to regain the soul of his father until he gets the key for the chest.<br/><br/>But one night while the organ-talented Davey is snoozing by his beloved organ, William steals the key and ventures out to find the chest. Gets advice from sea-monster sidekick of Jones's in wall. BUT IT TURNS OUT...the compass of Sparrow's isn't broken!!! It really shows you what you desire most, almost like the Mirror of Erised in Harry Potter, but it's a compass. Anyway, Sparrow finds that out and tells a pirate outfit-clad Elizabeth in order to find the missing William, who is aboard the Dutchman, she must find the chest.<br/><br/>So William escapes in order to find the chest and to get back to Elizabeth. He boards the Black Pearl. The Black Pearl, which is in Sparrow's hands, reaches the island of the chest first, then the sea-monster sidekicks on the Dutchman: Jones cannot leave the ship. When Elizabeth, William, COMMODORE NORRINGTON? and Jack Sparrow find the chest, the guys reveal their use for the chest and turn on each other, duelling with swords. Commodore and Turner get caught up 'cause they both love Elizabeth, and Sparrow gets the key for the chest. The four of them run into the vegetation of the island and find the sea-monster sidekicks fighting them. While duelling upon a rooftop, Commodore and Turner are stuck on a wheel or some sort, but huge. They fight on there for a while and on there, Sparrow gets a hold of the key and gets the beating heart of out the chest.<br/><br/>It's Pearl against Dutchman crew fighting now. Sea-monster sidekick of Jones sees Sparrow with heart and Sparrow frantically puts it in a jar. Everyone gets out of the fight unscathed except Commodore, who is left on the island. The giant squid-thing, which I think is supposed to be Davey Jones's locker, attacks the Pearl. The Pearl's crew abandons ship, but Elizabeth handcuffs Sparrow to the ship and is left to the squid-thing. Sparrow gets himself free and sticks a sword right in the mouth of the squid-thing and it dies. But as he swords it, he is swallowed along with it. The heart he has taken care of went missing during the attack of the squid-thing while the crew is aboard the Pearl.<br/><br/>Elizabeth makes up a lie about Sparrow going down with his ship. Scene changes to voodoo-like shack that was shown in the movie earlier, but no pivotal things happened in there, so I left it out. The crew of the Pearl, except Sparrow, is in the voodoo-shack talking to a voodoo-like woman with a thick accent. She tells them they should keep going and says they need someone to captain the ship who knows the waters.<br/><br/>This is where you get confused...almost mad! You see pirate boots, CONVINCED it's Captain Jack Sparrow. But the camera shows up to the face of the one, the only, CAPTAIN BARBOSSA. <br/><br/>FIN.<br/><br/>It screams sequel. Almost too loudly."

","Well, it made a record $132 Million opening weekend and that means only one thing: a lot of really disappointed people. I enjoyed the first movie, but I wasn't what you would call a fan. My wife dragged me along to this one and I relented mostly because of the poor reviews for Superman, which I would have rather seen.<br/><br/>Pirates II wasn't funny and it was totally self-indulgent. The editor is a genius, basically because he figured out how to get paid without actually doing any work. Almost every scene without fail had five to ten seconds of crap on each end of the action. The run time was way too long (which could have been remedied with cuts in appropriate places). For an action movie, it doesn't say much that I got bored on two separate occasions, finding myself searching for the remote.<br/><br/>The first movie was redeemed by a fantastic script and solid wit. The sequel had neither. I saw an interview with Johnny Depp in which he claimed to be willing to do ""eight of these movies if the scripts remain as good as the second one."" LIAR, LIAR, LIAR. I love Depp, but he will forever be a sell-out in my book if he continues to insist that this is a well made movie. I'm totally OK with actors making crap for the money so long as they acknowledge that they did it for the money.<br/><br/>The only thing that could have possibly redeemed this movie would have been extended gratuitous shots of Keira Knightly just standing around or doing basically anything. For a movie that didn't know when to edit a scene, there were surprisingly few of these shots. It also didn't help that at some point near the end of the film, she gained an ugly, obviously fake tan out of nowhere.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was bad, but it wasn't so poorly made as to become entertaining in its badity. This is the worse kind of film to watch. That being said, I'm definitely looking forward to the third one; at this rate it will be exceedingly awful and possibly awful enough to be entertainingly bad."

The plot is filled with confusion, hysteria, and completely baroque one liners. As soon as 30 minutes of the film passes the script introduces a new and More confusing plot than the previous one, and also fails to finish the storyline it has just abandoned. Not even the writers and director knew what this movie was about. I had more of an understanding of the movie from the trailer than I did in the actual film.<br/><br/>If you like completely mindless movies with no central plot or theme this is the one for you.

","The plot seemed to be written by choosing random scenes out of a hat in an effort to produce a boring, illogical and incoherent story with lackluster and completely unrealistic action scenes. Johnny Depp's character was the funny, aloof drunk that he was in the first one, but his character did not seem to evolve at all. The same old, ""seem like an honest man, tell lies, and really be honest at heart"" type thing. Orlando Bloom has too big of a roll, he needs to stick to the type of thing he had in Lord of the Rings. Kiera Knightley is beautiful as ever and does a decent job (it's not her fault that the scene were she dressed like a man was total garbage). Overall I would give it a one, and I wonder if the third one will go straight to DVD."

","9 July 2006. Long, boring, and uninteresting. This sequel tried mightedly using all the past comedic, action techniques of past movies. There was the cannibal scene from King Kong (2005), there was Romancing The Stone (1984) action-comedy, there was even the now tiring and worn out Johnny Depp replaying his comic one-liners using a weak script. There was only warmed over character development, a scattered smattering of connections. The movie by attempting to be everything ended up being too thin on most everything. The violence level was raised far beyond a family movie. The comedy was forced and lame. The only new movement was the rather new action scenes for action scene sake without really contributing to the plot. Most of this movie has been seen before in one form or another. And like Star Wars trilogy there is the romantic triangle at play here leaving for the third installment a much darker psychological conflict. Missing from this movie was the light hearted fun (that was seriously attempted) that didn't seem to balance the more darker, sinister forces at work here. Five out of Ten Stars."

","I saw the first Pirates movie, and liked it very much. In fact, I own it. This one was terrible! The movie just drags and drags. They take scenes that don't advance the plot and then make them just long enough that they are painful. The comic relief is decent, and the lead acting is good, but overall, the film left me very disappointed. The CGI is very well done for the most part, but the plot is just too boring and predictable to be considered interesting. This film didn't feel quite as exciting as the first film. While I understand that it is a Disney production, this film felt a bit more simple and childish than the first. Perhaps I was a victim of the marketing machine that built the hype up beyond being able to live up, but I just found it very underwhelming."

I walked into this movie with low expectations, and came out wanting it to be May 2007 already. This movie was a lot better than the first one. I am crazy about Johnny Depp, and he is the perfect person to play the hammy Captain Jack Sparrow, who owes a debt to the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, who is unrecognizable). He has to find the key to the chest that holds Davy Jones' heart and destroy the heart. He recruits his old friends, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) to help him on his journey. On the way, Will has a family reunion with his father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner. If you're looking for fun, action and adventure, this is the movie for you."

I also liked the scene when Elizibeth was on the boat of sailors besides Jack and Will and the sailors thought the ship was haunted. The love scene with Jack and Elizibeth had me freaked out, I was like screaming at my cousin ""I can't wait till May, I need to see it now"" all because Will and Elizibeth got mad at each other, all over Jack.

Great that all the gang was back for this one: the hilarious comedic duo of Pintel and Rigetti, Gibbs and the rest of the usual suspect pirate crew! Of course the introduction of new characters, the mythical Davy Jones and Will's father Bootstrap Bill enhanced character development in this one. The non-stop action made for a great ride!

","There's really not much to say about this movie strictly because of the fact that there's not much going on in this movie. The audience gets a simple plot that lasts definitely over a couple of hours, bogged down heavily with rather lengthy action sequences. People sword fight. People sail on ships. If that entertains you, then you'll like this movie.<br/><br/>If you want something to sink your teeth in, something with a little ""depth"" (pardon my pun with this being a pirate movie and all), take your business elsewhere. This is just a cheap, petty thrill to help roll in the bucks that will subdue the moviegoers with less complex needs.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, if you're an avid moviegoer, this movie may bore you. I know it did for me. The jokes really weren't that funny, nor was the action a spectacle. Although, I must admit, the makeup and atmosphere was probably the best element this movie has going for it. I give kudos to whoever took care of that.<br/><br/>Other than that, this is a sleeper. I didn't care too much for the ending either, but I won't mention more about it. You'll see what I mean if you see for yourselves, which, with the way this movie is really cruising at the box office, I'm sure you probably will.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp still has an interesting character though. So if there's any redeeming factor about this poorly scrambled together shindig, it's the makeup, atmosphere, and Mr. Depp. The rest was just assembled out of bits and pieces left in the Hollywood dumpster. It's a pity that there wasn't enough to give personalities to Will and Elizabeth."

","Usually you have to settle for mega eye candy at the expense of the story, or vice-versa. This sequel delivered a well-balanced blend of both, and for that I'm very grateful.<br/><br/>In the spirit of second acts, this installment is darker, both in terms of ambiance and character twists. The rum-soaked lurching, sexual innuendos and sight gags are still there (the second act still knows how to have fun), but there persists an undercurrent of real treachery, both promised and delivered.<br/><br/>The first film posed a basic challenge to what the term ""pirate"" really meant - pedestrian notions of ""good"" vs. ""evil"", as contrasted against Jack Sparrow's uber-utilitarian ""what a man can do; what a man can't do"" maxim, etc. And it was all a big laugh.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest, while still grinning, is decidedly grimmer. Inbetween the laughs, this sequel effectively pushes the lines of loyalty and sentiment, while adding more nuances to the already fantastic Pirate lore.<br/><br/>That, and Davy Jones and his pet Kraken are two decidedly nasty pieces of work.<br/><br/>Don't trouble yourself with the ""critics"", the usual fashion victims of pop culture. See it for yourself and enjoy the ride."

For those who have not seen the first one, you do not need to in order to understand this movie. Yes, its great to see the first one because you already know a bit about the characters but thats about it. This movie's story line is its very own (there again is why you wont be totally clueless when the movie is over).

I was entranced by the plot and the characters were amazing, from their well-written dialogue to their complexity that sometimes altered the story completely, but in a good way. The action sequences were clever, yet funny, and I just loved every part of the film. It was a little slow in the beginning because it was building up the story, but it quickly caught up its pace and blew me away for the rest of the movie. In conclusion, I found the film very endearing among all the other horrible summer movies this year, and inspiring for more terrific action/adventure movies to be made.

"shanfloyd","8","17","28","25 July 2006"," Preserves the mood and even excels at some points.
","This time I did expect a lot from a sequel and for the first time in my recent memory I am totally satisfied and adequately entertained. Come on, ""Dead Man's Chest"" starts off with the same mood and pace the first film left us with. But this film is far more complex in order to deliver something new.<br/><br/>First of all, it is just insanely hilarious. Really I didn't expect so much bout of comedy. Yes, a few of the funny scenes are rather forced but the rest are just brilliant... and this comedy mood stayed throughout the film even when suspense and action were full on. Second, the new characters... be it the crew of Jack Sparrow or Davy Jones and his men... are extremely well-designed and well-written. For the actors, Depp's acting this time looked rather forced sometimes as he was trying hard to achieve his Oscar-nominated standard of the character. But face it, in the first film Jack was something unique, here we already know his character and his antics, manner of speech etc. So I think ultimately Depp did a nice job. Keira Knightley has got a more wide and complex role this time but she does little besides delivering her beautiful bullet-like English accent. She falters often with careful emotional sequences. Bloom also hasn't much improved from his previous portrayal of Will Turner.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy portrays the infamous Davy Jones with much style. And the make-up and visual effects regarding him and his crew are really worth every praise. The overall special visual and sound effects are top-notch, as expected. Verbinski took special care building the sets and location, as evident by the excellent outdoor scenery and entirely believable and captivating indoor atmospheres like the bars, the dungeons and the tribal area in the river at night.<br/><br/>The film has enough amount of action, perhaps too much at some places with the underwater monster. It ends in a rather interesting manner, making you crave for the part 3 to come out. I really enjoyed the ending and its various implications or predictions. To summarize, ""Dead Man's Chest"" is definitely one of the best summer blockbusters in a long time."

You can't help but laughing at all the fighting scenes because they just aren't very serious. Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is responsible for that! He has done a wonderful job for this character and it shows just what a fantastic actor he is. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly were also very good but Johnny Depp is really the star of the show. It is funny, thrilling and so enthrawlling that you forget you brought popcorn to the movie. It is definitely worth a second look.<br/><br/>Well done Disney, you have finally got something right!"

","OMG! what can I say!? Fantastic, Superb, Thrilling. POTC Dead Man's Chest was all of those things and more. I must say that if you are looking for the 2nd most thrilling ride of your life (after POTC Curse of the Black Pearl that is) then sign up for the sequel of a lifetime. The crew is back in full force and Captain Jack Sparrow is funnier than he was last time around. Orland Bloom and Keira Knightly were wonderful Pirates, and the addition of Bill Nighy as Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgaard as Bootstrap Bill was right on the money. Ragetti and Pintel were back in full force as was the wooden eye (lol). The action sequences were over the top but not to be outdone. I got dizzy at my second showing (I sat near the front!) during the wheel sequence. Norrington is very comical and rightly has a bigger part in this one (although not as you might expect). Tom Hollander as the new Lord of Port Royal was surprising at first but welcomed. He is a fantastic actor. I Must say that Tia is a character who I think will be a major player in POTC 3. The movie got a standing ovation in both showings I saw on Friday and during the last two minutes of the movie you couldn't even hear the dialog because everyone was hooting and hollering from a surprise character appearance (and no not Keith Richards). I won't spoil it and say who but man was I cheering louder than most. All in all the movie was one of the best I have ever seen and certainly as good if not maybe better (I have to see it some more) than its predecessor.<br/><br/>Be Sure To Stay After The Credits For A Surprise Little Bit Tying Up A Loose End From Earlier In The Movie!!!!"

I was expecting them to wrap up all the plot lines, but no they couldn't do that.<br/><br/>You spend 2.5 hours in the watching the thing to find discover that not only did they wrap up any of the plot lines they started in this movie, they create more bogus plot lines that we have to assume will be wrapped up in the 3rd movie. Its leaves you unsatisfactory feeling of why did I just spend $20 to go see this movie.

This film was magnificent, it had depth, humor, darkness and suspense. I remember wishing for the film to get lighter at the same time wishing it would get darker, the villains were scary enough but yet they were humorous, the plot was not complex while at the same time it was very thought provoking and I remember at the end feeling the way I did about ""The Empire Strikes Back"". I think the main thing to remember is this is supposed to be a fun film but also a darker, dramatic film.<br/><br/>Go see it and enjoy the film for what it is, a bridge that will tie the to mountains together<br/><br/>BTW I checked the spoiler button just in case someone considered any of this spoilers."
"glen-88","4","10","15","8 July 2006"," Pirates of the Convoluted: Long friggin film
","I wanted to like this movie. I really did. But by an hour and a half into the film with no real understanding of what was going on I started to doze off. When I awoke there was still another hour or so to sit through.<br/><br/>The actors of course all did a good job. The dialogue and humor was there in the beginning though by the end it wained considerably. The real problem was the plot. This new ""curse"" that befalls Jack Sparrow gets more complex every five minutes, and nothing is really explained. Near the end the scenes usually go something like this:<br/><br/>""Good lord man where's Davy Jone's key?"" - Jack Sparrow ""It goes to the box! But where is the box?"" - Will ""What box? I have his heart!"" - Some guy ""who are you?"" - Jack Sparrow ""I'm some guy from the first movie, and I want his heart!"" - Some guy ""Hey there's a cracken here with tentacles!"" - Will ""Now I have his heart!"" - Some other pirate guy ""What about the cracken? And the curse?"" - Will ""What curse?"" - Other pirate guy ""The curse of the box!"" - Jack ""No the curse is on the key!"" - Will ""No, whoever has the heart has the power!"" - Will's dad ""What power?"" - Keira knightley ""Dont mind that, lets fight!"" - Jack<br/><br/>OK well its not exactly like that but thats how it feels after sitting through all three mind numbing hours of the film. The big twist ending...is well, lame. They bring back someone - a certain bad guy - to help poor JS out of his jam in some thrown together lame cliff hanger.<br/><br/>I'm not saying everything about the film is bad, but it definitely needed a rewrite before it was released. More doesn't always mean better. Aaaarggghh, what a shame."
"rikctid","7","40","76","6 July 2006"," Can't help but feel disappointed
","I loved the first POTC and am a big fan of Johnny Depp's movies, and indeed the man himself is pretty much flawless again in this sequel. My gripe really centres around the unnecessarily complicated plot and the overall length of the film. Unlike the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings trilogy there is nothing in the screenplay to really justify the bum-numbing 150 minutes spent watching this film, particularly as the plot takes so long to get going. The major set pieces involving the island cannibals and the key to Davy Jones' locker are good but seriously in need of editing, and although the CGI effects are impressive, there really is only so many times you can marvel at the 'beastie' before its time to stifle the yawns. Anyone who saw King Kong and experienced midway restlessness will probably recognise similar symptoms here too. That said, the performances by the lead actors are excellent and although the script doesn't seem to provide the same number of laughs found in the first film, this is generally not a poor sequel. Expectation gained from the first film is likely to be an issue when assessing the merits of the sequel and most fans of JD will not be too disappointed, I just hope this 'trilogy' does a 'Back to the Future' and ends with a pacey flourish, rather than a further need for pressure-relieving cushions."
"adudewhoiscool","10","11","17","19 August 2006"," If you enjoyed the first, you will most likely enjoy this.
","If you enjoyed ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" then you will enjoy the sequel just as much. This had everything that made the first one enjoyable. There is amazing sword fight/action sequences, creepy bad people created with incredible special effects, romance, humor, and of course Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow made a deal with Davy Jones. The deal was for Jack to be captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years, then give up his sole and become a crew member of the Flying Dutchman. Those thirteen years are up, and Davy Jones is after Jack Sparrow. Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann are also on the lookout as well. After being arrested by the British government for aiding in the escape of Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are blackmailed into helping track down Jack. Lord Cutler Beckett forces them to find Sparrow and obtain a magical compass from him in exchange for pardons.<br/><br/>There were many similarities to ""Empire Strikes Back."" This is darker compared to the first film, just as ""Empire Strikes Back"" was to ""A New Hope."" Captain Jack Sparrow has that classic Han Solo type feel, Will Turner is a lot like Luke, and even Elizabeth Swann has a similar feel to Leia. Even Ragetti, tall and skinny, and Pintel, short and round, are back and have some comedic roles, just like R2D2 and C3P0. There is a cliffhanger, which will catch most people by surprise, much like ""Empire Strikes Back"" did.<br/><br/>Once again, there is a great villain. Davy Jones was a better villain then Captain Barbossa. What made him better was that Davy Jones a more multi-dimension character then Barbossa. Barbossa was just pure evil. At least once did you think that Davy Jones had a passionate side, but then the next scene he would do something totally brutal and evil. Davy Jones is sure to become a classic villain.<br/><br/>The special and visual effects, once again, are top notch. From the look of Davy Jones to his henchman, it was spectacular. Davy Jones was created the same way that Gollum/Smeagol was in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Some of the special effects used to make his tentacles are possibly the best use of CGI ever shown on screen. Davy Jones and his crew all looked like creatures from the sea. Davy Jones' main defense, which he summons to destroy ships, was the Kracken, a giant tentacled beast with a toothy throat similar to the fictional creature called a Sarlacc from ""Star Wars VI: Return of the Jedi."" Just like in the first movie, you should expect some major sword fights, and those fights are improved.<br/><br/>A ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie cannot be reviewed without mentioning Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Once again, the rum loving pirate steals the show and shows that his character is the coolest character since Hans Solo in the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy. His introduction was humorous, but not as memorable as the first one. Hopefully, Johnny Depp is once again nominated for best actor. It will be exciting to see him and Keith Richards, who was Johnny's inspiration for Jack Sparrow, on the screen together. In case you did not know, there will be a third movie and Keith Richards will be playing Jack Sparrow's father.<br/><br/>Some of the side characters we all knew and loved are back, such as Governor Swann (played by Jonathan Pryce), Pintel (played by Lee Arenberg), Ragetti (played by Mackenzie Crook), Mr. Gibbs (played by Kevin McNally), and Marty (played by Martin Klebba). Those people got the same amount of screen time. Norington (played by Jack Davenport) has received a bigger, more in depth role. Orlando Bloom (who plays Will Turner) has shown a little improvement and has improved quite a bit since he donned bows and arrows in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Keira Knightley (who plays Elisabeth Swann) has also added a little bit more to her character.<br/><br/>The new additions are also well done. ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner (played by Stellan Skarguard), Will Turner's father, is finally introduced and he had very nice chemistry with Will. Another interesting character was a woman named Tia Dalma (played by Naomie Harris). She was very strange and was possibly even weirder (maybe just more mysterious and unknown) then Jack. Maybe they will explain more about her back-story in the next chapter. Of course, we know about Davy Jones (played by Bill Nighy).<br/><br/>If you are looking for the perfect summer popcorn movie, you are in the right place. This was just as enjoyable as the first movie. This is must see on the big screen and hopefully you do not forget to leave until after the credits. Bring your family, bring your friends, and do not forget to start singing, ""Yo ho, yo ho, the pirates life for me."" ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is very recommended!"

","I am beginning to believe that I am the only person who was disappointed by this sequel. The film distinctly lacks pace and often grinds to a dead stop. Scenes which should be rolling along with the velocity of a runaway train, stagger and falter like a drunk. For example the overlong scene between Jack Sparrow and the cannibals. The main characters boarded and left the Flying Dutchman so rapidly I lost track of what ship they were supposed to be on after a while.<br/><br/>I'm afraid the film has fallen into the Star Wars trap of replacing plot with special effects.<br/><br/>Watch the first Pirates and then this one and you will see what I mean."

","The first installment was charming and a lot of fun. The sequel was beyond awful. The sequel was insulting. I wanted to leave at about the halfway point, and it turned out the two people I went with were thinking the same thing. When, after about half an hour, it became obvious that the fresh script and swashbuckling magic of ""The Black Pearl"" had been prostituted in the name of effects and lame stunts, I started hoping for at least a good naval battle, or something, to fall back on. Unfortunately, even that bit fell short. I feel like I just sat through ""The Phantom Menace"" again. Remember how disappointing ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" was? Dead Man's Chest is worse. I feel so completely ripped off. I am two and a half hours closer to my grave with nothing to show for it."

","I really cannot comprehend how this movie could possibly have a 7.9 on IMDb. I would go as far to say that this movie was WORSE than The Village (which I also hated). The story picks up a bit after the last movie left off, which is probably the only good thing about the movie. After the intro, he just goes horribly wrong. The plot feels like it's pulled and twisted just so that they can stretch this movie to an uncomfortable 2.5 hours and leave the story open at the end so they can make 4 or 5 more of these atrocities. The number of plot holes created from this warped directing style just adds to the confusion of why I actually bought a ticket in the first place. Maybe, it was because I liked the first movie and expected the 2nd to not be absolute junk. I can honestly state that I will never watch another Gore Verbinski movie, seeing that having his name stamped on a movie must mark it as manure.<br/><br/>You've bested me this time Gore Verbinski and taken me gold, it will not happen again!"
"dizzjay","2","6","8","31 December 2006"," Loss of Focus
","I can't comment on the ending of this film as I didn't watch all of it. The thing that turned me off the most was the whipping and the general cruelty. I was also annoyed with the ragged construction. The Black Pearl starts off with Jack Sparrow's daring escape. Dead Man's Chest also has an escape at the beginning, but the difference is that the escape in the Black Pearl added to the plot and built character. The escape in DMC has nothing to do with the plot or characters at all, it was just exciting filler. And I suppose it was supposed to be funny in a Wile E. Coyote sort of way when the cage full of prisoners falls into the gorge, but when you think about it, it's quite gross to think of men trapped in a cage plunging to their deaths. In The Black Pearl the plot centered around Jack Sparrow's quest to get his ship back and all the other character's motivations centered on that. Dead Man's Chest has four plot lines, they are connected but have four different motivations: Sparrow wants to be free of his curse; William Turner wants to resolve his relationship with his father and save Elizabeth; Elizabeth wants to find Will Turner; and the East India Company wants Jack's compass for their own nefarious ends. So the whole thing has lost its focus. Also missing was Jack Sparrow's cleverness. In The Black Pearl, Jack Sparrow's commandeering of the Interceptor was great fun and very imaginative - there is nothing like that imagination in Dead Man's Chest. Overall a great disappointment."

The ""seafood"" ghost pirates are absurd and most of the scenes were copied and pasted from other adventure movies (hello Indy). The story was poor and the main character, Jack Sparrow, doesn't say anything to me. At least, a fantasy movie should thrill you and there's nothing thrilling in this movie.

Was this movie really a sequel? Hardly. Everything in from the first movie was completely undone here. The elements of the movie such as characters and objects, all of it was switched around to accommodate a completely different story line. Satisfying? As far from it as possible. This movie was as complete as the opening scrolls in the Star Wars movie. All it did was set the scene for the next one, which I hope is more complete.

Oh yeah i almost forgot, why does everyone laugh at these petty ""jokes"" throughout the whole movie. If you want to make a comedy, title it as a comedy, not an action adventure. This movie simply didn't keep my on the edge of my seat. I was waiting and waiting for the action to happen and finally it came at the end for about 20 minutes, the best part of the movie.

Compared to Black Pearl, the story has even more twists and sub-plots, while the pace of Dead M C is also higher than BP (and I also loved that one). Another great aspect is the return of recognizable characters of the first part with a very pleasant appearance of one of my favorite characters of BP in the last scene (again: IMHO).

If you appreciate the overall story of ""The Pirates of the Caribbean,"" then you will also appreciate this film. It definitely does its job as part of a trilogy, and opens the door for a grand finale in the third movie. The acting was also supreme, and the amount of interesting and exciting action scenes added a lot of quality effect. Davy Jones' crew adds to the story much like Captain Barbosa's crew of the damned added to the first film. Once again, it did leave the door pretty wide open for the third movie in the series.

The only negative comment I can muster is towards a particular line in the film, which I felt a bit cheesy (SLIGHT SPOILER ahead): ""Why is the rum always gone?"". Other than that, references to the previous film were amusing and all the actors delivered stellar performances. I'm so glad that Johnny loves this character as much as his audience, and is willing to do more films.

I have been counting down the days to the movie for the past two years and was very angry when I wasn't able to go to the premiere in Disney Land. I had a HUGE party honoring the second movie on the sixth and saw the midnight show. I was definitely not disappointed. However I wasn't too surprised either...I had read the book, watched trailers, read whatever I could that was supposedly ""the script""...although I was defiantly not expecting the ending. The cliffhanger will definitely keep me wondering. The humor and the intensity of this film is enough to keep watchers at the end of their seats. I've seen this movie every day since midnight on Thursday and plan on seeing it everyday until it is out of theaters. If you loved the first movie then you will think that 'Dead Man's Chest' is much better! Johnny, Orlando, and Keira do a great job in portraying their roles and always have and will I am sure. Verbinski is a pure genius and so are the writers of the film. Their job I'm sure is very stressful but in the end they pulled off a movie that is WAY to good for words.

"pimpdawg55566678","10","15","25","10 July 2006"," I liked it better then the first!!!!
","Dead Mans Chest far surpassed my wildest expectations. I don't think I have ever had so much fun at the movies. It may start off slow but once it picks up it rarely slows down. It is one wild ride.<br/><br/>First and foremost this movie is a lot darker then the first. The themes are darker, the tone is darker, the environment is more mysterious and suspenseful. This in my opinion really is what makes it superior to the first film. The first film in my opinion was more lighthearted and kid friendly. This on the other hand has a lot more mature elements.<br/><br/>Second the fighting and action sequences are more violent and intense. They are also a lot longer (This is not a bad thing in my opinion.) The best fight of the entire movie is near the end when Will, Jack and the former Commodore Norrington are fighting on the water wheel. Not only is it just fun to watch there are also more fights going on at the same time (Mainly Elizabeth and the two pirates whose names I do not recall are fighting Davy Jones crew.) The entire scene is simply amazing. Next would probably be the crew of the Black Pearl fighting the Kracken. It is a very intense fight and also an awesome fight. I really liked it a lot.<br/><br/>Third the humor in this one is a lot funnier and there is more of it. The funniest part of the whole movie is probably on the island full of cannibals. It is an awesome and hilarious part of the movie. Jack vs. the fruit throwing Moms is hilarious. Then him falling threw every single bridge. I tell you there really is nothing funnier then that entire scene and the sequence of events that take place.<br/><br/>Fourth the special effects are amazing. They are easily the best so far this year and are likely the best since ROTK and COBP. Davy Jones is simply stunning. You won't even be able to tell when the make up stops and the effects begin. It looks that real. The only scene where it looks a little more animated is when Jack is getting ready to go head on into the kracken.<br/><br/>Fifth the acting is even better then the first. Depp does an excellent job and deserves an award. Knightely is simply beautiful. Bloom also does a decent job. Nighy really steals the show though. He does an excellent as Davy Jones and he at the very least deserves an award for best supporting actor. I mean he really did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>All in all this movie is far better then anyone could have hoped or dreamed of. It is easily the best movie of the summer. I hope it does extremely well at the box office because it deserves every penny."
"wdamico","1","17","29","10 July 2006"," a tediously-long, dull movie lacking anything for those over age 12
","2 1/2 hours was way to much, and I was already looking at my watch 45 minutes in regretting what I'd gotten myself into. 1 3/4 hours would have been sufficient and easily attainable due to the numerous pointless scenes that didn't contribute to the ""plot"" and should have been axed.<br/><br/>The movie lacked a serious, intriguing tone at any point as the entire cast pranced about as if Spongebob's adventures was the topic at hand as opposed to having a true, pervasive pirate theme. Depp came across as an effeminate, slapstick, goof-ball captain as opposed to a seasoned sea dog.<br/><br/>The comedic devices used throughout were EXTREMELY trite and low brow and make Beavis and Butthead and the Keystone Cops look sophisticated by comparison. The level of humor in the Shrek series, for example, appeals to a much larger audience base than does DMC's. One example is the whole scene with the cannibals running down the beach after the pirates and then running back up the beach after the dog. The entire segment was literally slapstick and exceedingly juvenile in nature. It falls on its face when compared, for example, to the similar scene of Indy Jones running away from the natives and into the airplane at the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark.<br/><br/>Even the scene with the dice game was a bust. It could have been very tense and suspenseful given fates were literally hanging in the balance. Instead, it came across as anticlimactic given it was hard to follow the progress of the intended ""suspense"" as the number of 5's, 4's, etc. were wagered and rolled.<br/><br/>The scene with the dirt and the heart was inexcusably lame given this was what we were supposedly building up to and waiting on for the entire 2 1/2 hours. Naturally, the inept Depp drops and breaks the jar (whoops!) on the deck of the ship. But, given this is fantasy, what are we supposed to even be expecting will happen given its an ""immortal"" heart, magic dirt in a jar, etc.? Will Davey Jones die once the heart is placed in the dirt? Evidently not. Does the heart have to remain in the dirt for a period of time first before whatever happens happens? Well, the jar broke so we don't know if it was in there ""long enough"" to take effect. The heart evidently fell into the ocean when the boat sank so does that mean anything regarding Davey's immortality? Dunno. When Davey opens the chest and finds his heart isn't in there he seems disappointed, but evidently unaware that the magical heart-in-dirt process had taken place so evidently the event hadn't even fazed him. The entire premise, despite being the focus of the entire movie, is simply dropped, unaddressed, and unresolved (yes, I understand there's a 3rd movie).<br/><br/>The bottom line is that there is no true drama or suspense, no true comedy, and a lack of intuitive logic about the entire movie. Instead, the appeal appears to be for the fancy costumes, nifty special effects, sex appeal of the primary actors, etc. without a shred of anything else that makes a movie entertaining for those out of grammar school.<br/><br/>What a disappointment given all the hype."
"mlsandal","8","17","29","9 July 2006"," my thoughts
","I went to see Dead Man's Chest last night. It was a packed theater. A few people were even dressed for the occasion, swords and all. As soon as the film began, I was hooked. From the moment CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow made his entrance (I cheered) to the shocker at the very end, I loved every minute. Most everyone else did as well. If this was a stand-alone movie, I might have been disappointed because of the ""here comes the sequel"" cliffhanger. But as part II of a trilogy, it works wonderfully. It was darker, funnier, and the various sea battles, swordfights, and escapes were creative and exciting. I appreciated how the director balanced the serious dialogue with slapstick comedy so well. Davy Jones' crew were gross and unpleasant to look at, but that was the point. They're trapped in a watery hell, they're not exactly going to have faces like Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley (people who complained about the ugly pirates probably went to the film just to ""ooh"" at the two actors listed above). The plot was a little hard to follow, but if you pay attention, you'll be alright. I had no problem with the violence and I believe it was done tastefully, not gory or graphic. It's a PG-13 movie based on an idea of Uncle Walt's, not some soccer mom's home video of the ride in Disneyland. I say kudos to the Disney company for having taken such a chance three years ago with The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's about time they realized that most of their original customers have grown up and want things a little more mature from the main Mouse. By the way, Johnny Depp is an incredible actor. Jack Sparrow just might be my favorite franchise movie character since Indiana Jones (incidentally, Spielberg would be proud of this film I think. It feels a lot like Raiders of the Lost Ark at sea). The CGI was top-notch. I really believed there was a giant squid crushing those ships, and as mentioned before, the crew of the Flying Dutchman were delightfully creepy. I don't know if I can wait for the final installment."

","that is the best way i can describe this one. in the first the characters were hollow, in Dead Man's Chest you actually feel for the characters and they are alive. in PEARL, all that kept that bloated crock, to steal a great summary from peter travers, was DEPP almost mocking, insane, and brilliant performance as JACK.<br/><br/>in this film, the story is stronger. it is darker, and the acting from all is better, seeming to realize that their is REAL conflict going on, as much as can be in this type of film.<br/><br/>The extra serious and darker tone adds what i thought was the biggest loss from the first one, and that was how silly and corny it was at one time and then how overly serious certain parts were trying to be and were almost laughable.<br/><br/>in DEAD MAN's CHEST, the corny stuff works with the story and doesn't seem so placed, and the serious tone is not forced, it IS the tone, and backed up by dark characters, betrayal, and conflicts.<br/><br/>IT is a GREAT, popcorn film, with a truly unforeseen cliffhanger and punch to the gut...."

","Man,these Summer Blockbusters keep getting better and better.One after another,each better than the previous ones.I'm sorry Superman,but those bloody pirates are just so damn good that ,you've got to fall in love with them.<br/><br/>Pirates of Caribbean is the film that shows what Summer Blockbuster is all about.They don't make movies like these you know.It was endlessly entertaining,more entertaining and fun than anything all year.Not even the Man of Steel could pull this off.<br/><br/>With all the cast returning and more,this is a joy ride that you have to pay twice to fully experience it and feel it.I was astounded and rocked.This film was awesome.<br/><br/>The film begins with Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner being arrested just before they were about to get married.They are accused of letting Jack Sparow escape.So in return Will must find Sparrow to help himself.While Elizabeth tries to escape, follows Will.Settling down with his ship and crew, Jack Sparrow is pretty much hidding something himself.But things of course can't be well for a damned Pirate,when a squid like pirate Davvy Jones reminds Jack that he has an old debt to pay.So,of course ,the dishonestly honest Jack must seek help from Elizabeth and Will Turner and there we go again.Another wild ride that will simply leaves you completely satisfied.<br/><br/>One hour to this film and I found myself completely clueless.All that was taking place on screen made no sense.With all its silliness and half baked jokes really left me terribly unsatisfied and disappointed.It filled me with doubt that the rest of the film is pretty much gonna be like this.But then by the start of the second hour,the film picks up like a person can spot a pirates lie.Then it enters back to territory that made the first film so endlessly enjoyable.The smartness and clever side of the script emerged and thrills,surprises and incredible effects with huge excitement totally made me change my mind.And an ending that will leave you dying to see the third part.All that pretty much assured me that ,this sequel is exactly what I had expected.<br/><br/>There's everything here for everyone.The thing that Superman Slightly lacked.Colorful ,fun Characters,smart dialogues,great epic-sized action.And of course,some really ,really awe-inspiring CGI effects.<br/><br/>There are twists and surprising turns,especially towards the end ,where the fun gets even better ,scene after scene.Something great is always popping up.<br/><br/>Though less superior than its already splendid first installment,we all loved the first one.And it concludes with a cliffhanger to leave you thirsty for the third.It's the kind of cliffhanger that Reloaded gave us,but its final installment didn't live up to expectations.But I can say this much that ,this films finale,or final installment will rock the world.<br/><br/>The Production designs,the sets were unbelievable!They were breath taking.They were so elaborate and detailed that they meet the standards of LORD OF THE RINGS films.It gives the film an other-worldly look.As if the characters were in some kind of a fantasy world.<br/><br/>Thank someone,that we have a versatile actor like Johnny Depp.The only actor who I would thank.Having his presence throughout the film was like having a magician constantly pulling out tricks that are all satisfying.Depp,is the first and best reason to watch this film,just like the first one.Knightley is a surprise here.The first one didn't develop her character much,but here she elevates and pushes the boundaries.She really has a lot to do here.Bloom was just like he was in the first one.But his character discovers something that will leave the audience surprised.That is his father.What a surprise it was to finally see the legendary Bootstrap Bill,and Sarsgard was perfection.And then there is the always fabulous Billy Nighy.Where the first one had Geoffrey Rush,here we have Nighy to give you a great baddie.Who never had disappointed me with his performance.So goes for the rest of the cast with a few new additions,such as Naomi Harris.<br/><br/>Kudos,to Director Gore Verbinski,and Producer Bruckheimer and Ted Elliot& Terry Rosio for their smart,witty writing.They all give you the very definition of ""sequels better than the original"".They give you a grand spectacle.They really give you everything you deserve to get from a summer Blockbuster.It's a film that we deserve after numerous Blockbusters that didn't fully satisfied us.This film boosts a better score than the first one too.<br/><br/>This one is purely fantasy.The Squid looking Pirates are hardly believable,I mean did they ever existed in really world?Whereas the first one had a more believable Bad Pirates.In this film,the Pirates are more Fantasy-like.And somehow detaches itself from reality.It doesn't occur to you that this might've happened.I mean Pirates that look like squids can hardly be bought.It features a lot more weird creatures,that are actually pirates and more.Giant sea monsters and creatures that are very well created with CGI.And that's one of the few big flaws this film has.It doesn't make itself realistic,nor does it take itself too seriously.When there's something dramatic and serious is suppose to happen.And yes,it's a lot more darker than the first one. Way dark.Don't bring those kids of yours,or they'll hate pirates and their misadventures.<br/><br/>Yet,this is a splendid entertainer.It's funny,exciting,fast-paced even with 2 hours plus length.It's simply great.This film features more than you could ask for.Those 2 and a half hours in the dark will keep you thrilled throughout.This year's greatest entertainment is here and will knock you flat.I've seen many Blockbusters, from V for Vendetta,to MI3,Da Vinci to X3 to Superman returns.But none could achieve the satisfaction as this Pirates sequel did.So,it's not all that risky to trust the bloody Pirates after all."
"joshduggan","1","26","48","10 July 2006"," (Spoiler Alert) This film is like having a fat man who ate at IHOP run a marathon and then drop a diarrhea dump on your chest and proceed to use your face as toilet paper
","I should preface this review by saying that I was indifferent as to how I might feel about this film going into it. I thought the first film was fairly good. It was entertaining, but nothing that made me yearn for a second one. That being said, I hadn't read a review of this film (and still haven't) and had only heard that it had received mixed reviews. I had tempered expectations going into the theater, but I was certainly open to a good time.<br/><br/>A good time was not had. This film was quite simply awful. I have not seen anything in a long time that made me marvel at the fact that it was actually the finished product of a gigantic summer film churned out by a Hollywood Studio. I saw X-Men 3. While that was dreadful, this was eons past X3 in terms of excrement put to celluloid.<br/><br/>The plot was akin to a second-grader's class project. There was zero character development and not a single moment in which you thought you were seeing an original thought projected onto the screen. While it is a sequel, at some point the things that happen to the characters should matter, and if something bad happens to a character, the events that have molded him or her to that point should affect the audience somehow. Instead, the tools responsible for this screenplay have events happen without emotionally investing the audience in any way, shape, or form as to the fate of the characters on-screen, simply hoping that writing an event will somehow tug at the heart-strings of the audience without ever having to earn it.<br/><br/>I don't know that it is entirely the filmmakers' fault, because it seems that Verbinski & Co. were tied to some P.O.S. script that was churned out in a matter of days to get the cameras rolling, so Disney could bend the movie-goer over and sodomize them while getting paid for it. In the place of an actual story, they were probably told to blow up the film with mind-numbing action sequences and lame special effects.<br/><br/>To add insult to injury, the film clocks in at a mere two-and-a-half hours, which for a film with a plot wouldn't bother me in the least, but when you can write out the entire plot of this film in a matter of moments, seeing that paper-thin storyline stretched into 150 minutes is unbearable.<br/><br/>I could even make an exception to all of the aforementioned gripes and say that there was something in the film worthwhile if there was one performance from the cast that was mildly amusing. Alas, there is not. The actors all seem to have mailed it in, including Depp, who had a single chuckle-worthy moment as a follow-up to an Oscar-nominated turn in the previous Pirates outing.<br/><br/>***********SPOILER ALERT*************** When it comes down to it, all you'll get from this film is an obscenely long prologue to Pirates of the Caribbean 3: The Search for Spock--I mean Jack, because the entire plot of this atrocious piece of refuse is enough to fill a mere introduction to a real story."
"ncnewsmachine","1","25","46","15 July 2006"," 2 and a half hours I'll never have back
","Worst movie I've seen in 10 years. Where to begin? This is dark. It is violent. Johnny Depp is no longer acting the role of Capt. Jack, he's mugging it. The plot is confusing and often nothing more than a convoluted way to work in yet another fight scene.<br/><br/>If you're looking for the humor found in the first one, you're going to be sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>And could we decide what accent Davy Jones is supposed to have, and stick with it?<br/><br/>Right up there with Back to the Future II. <br/><br/>My recommendation: Avoid it in droves."
"barritz_caddy","1","23","42","25 July 2006"," Without a doubt the worst pirate movie I've ever seen...
","I thoroughly enjoyed the original and went to see this movie with a very positive attitude. However, this film is over two hours of special effects and needless events. If you look past the sword-fights, weird characters, and Depp's popular pirate impersonation there is no plot development. Quentin Tarantino once said ""Good movies tell a story and bad/poorly written ones describe a situation. Unfortunately most movies that end up in theaters fall into the latter category."" ""Dead Man's Chest"" puts the same lovable and unique characters from ""Black Pearl"" into a very very long string of meaningless situations. After the first 90 minutes or so, even the characters from the first film (yes- they are all back) lost their luster. The director quickly overused the character traits and quirks that made the cast of the first movie so unique. My father (also a fan of the first film) and I compared our reactions and both drew the same conclusion: This movie is nothing more than a setup for the third, with an ending that cheaply ensures you'll be back next year. If you like Depp's face, computerized sea-creature-men, and battle scenes, then this is the one to see. However, if you are looking for substance, character development, or a plot, then I'd recommend something else."
"Glucojel","1","7","10","7 January 2007"," Tight script. Deep character arcs. Rewarding ending. This movie has none of those. Here's why.
","""We're not making a movie about pirates, we're making a pirate movie"" was the motto Curse of the Black Pearl was made under, and it worked fantastically. Fast paced, funny and dazzling. The undead came into it but were used to give the plot an extra dimension and actually add to the story, not diminish it.<br/><br/>All I wanted with the sequel was more ship combat, and less reliance on over the top CGI, not a film that breaks some of the most basic rules of film structure.<br/><br/>Problems start almost immediately when Jack blasts a crow. Sure, he's shot Barbossa and doesn't have to save his bullets anymore, but a pirate as accomplished as Jack wouldn't go wasting shot on something like that! It's completely against his character; though going out of character happens all too often in this film. More on that later.<br/><br/>What follows is the most messed up and muddled film I've seen in living memory. Why? Two words: The Natives. The whole time they spend on that island with the cannibals (all...40ish minutes of it), not only has nothing to do with anything else, but it grinds the movie to a halt. It's more like an episode of 'the adventures of Jack Sparrow' with a ridiculous premise: he suddenly finds himself king of a tribe that does everything he says as long as they get to burn him alive? That's got to be the biggest act of Deus Ex Machina since Alice discovers Wonderland was an LSD dream.<br/><br/>By the way- I have nothing wrong with Johnny Depp, he does a superb job with what he is given, which in this case values a Sparrowfest at the cost of any real cohesive story.<br/><br/>Of course, with pirate movies, there are always sword-fights and ship battles. The sword-fight is outstanding. It's got some of that 'have to make it more extreme than what we've already done' school of thought that made the new Star Wars trilogy so camp, but damn- it's so in-your-face and perilous that you don't care. The ship battles though, are pathetic. I mean, there are no less than three encounters, right? and EVERY SINGLE TIME it looks like we're in for a decent ship battle, they bring out the CGI infested Kraaken. It's good the first time- another high-seas myth referenced. Then it becomes apparent that they're going to use it whenever a ship needs attacking. There is a brief section where a revolving tri-barreled cannon is used instead (what the hell? this isn't Apocalypse Now!) but nobody seems to stay on the water for more then 5 minutes without getting attacked by the giant squid, which even when severely crippled by an explosion triggered by a bullet-time shot (bullet time? in a pirate movie? next they'll be punching through walls...) it STILL comes after them, even-though-it-loses-about-three limbs-completely. Now, if someone blew off my legs and an arm, I'd damn well call it quits, but no, they are informed it will be back, as if losing multiple appendages is a daily occurrence for the beast. Yeah right.<br/><br/>OK, so enough of that- what about these character problems, you say? still not convinced? In the first film, Elizabeth clearly has no attraction to Jack whatsoever, and yet while he has that crucial pardon document on his person she can't stop glaring at him with smouldering eyes. At the time I always figured the compass was showing she wanted that document back to use as leverage, which was an interesting plan, but no, it turns out she's just hot for him, and why? because of the fan-base. Nothing kills movie franchises like a director who starts compromising on stuff just to please fans. Even if she only smooches him to save herself it still 'had to be there', right? Wrong.<br/><br/>This brings up another point. A HUGE point. Will actually SEES Liz and Jack going at it, and considering everything he's done for both of them you'd expect him to be angry, enraged; absolutely livid. But surprisingly when everyone jumps into the 'Yes, let's go and save Jack' mob at the end, Will joins them without even batting an eyelid. Either he's got no long term memory, or someone ripped his spine out. Or maybe the scriptwriters just hoped nobody would notice the plot hole the size of Port Royale itself. They probably also wanted people to view Norrington as a villain, but not a single thing he did during the film overturned the huge sympathy I had for him, given what has happened to him so far.<br/><br/>And if you're going to show an extinct game being played -for such high stakes- make sure you give at least a hint as to how it works! Any suspense the dice game could have had was totally destroyed by the fact that nobody in the audience knew how the game is played! Finally, the ending is such a blatant disregard of the 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' mantra. Not only does it say pretty much everything Jack fought for in the original movie was for absolutely nothing, it left us wondering what other crap will be changed around for the next one. Perhaps those two Royal Navy guards will return in the third as werewolves or something equally absurd. It's clear that the franchise is now more sci-fi eye candy than anything resembling an old swashbuckler like Black Pearl was.<br/><br/>The after credit sequence in Pearl opened up some new story possibilities, but the one in this? It just reminds you that the dog is set to be roasted, without actually resolving the situation, or even advancing it! They might as well have shown the candle holder in Elizabeth's house falling off the wall again instead- at least that would have got a laugh or two.<br/><br/>Biggest disappointment of the year, and the worst sequel since Mission Impossible 2."
"librarier","1","33","64","9 July 2006"," Lots of action ... Zero plot ... Insipid dialog
","How can the actors in this film not be hanging their heads in shame at the moronic dialog they had to deliver? And where's the PLOT? Dangit, doesn't ANYONE in Hollywood know a THING about creating a STORY?!?! Granted, Johnny Depp delighted everyone with his interpretation of the Captain Jack character in the first episode. Unfortunately, there is nothing in this ""story"" that develops his character further. Because the dialog given for the other characters (Will & Elizabeth) is so incredibly LAME, they haven't much to work with and fall flat. Bloom's personal charisma ameliorates the lack of substance left to him by the screenwriter(s). Unfortunately, Knightley's inexperience leaves her with nothing to fall back on with this pathetic script and she comes off as a total fool, playing the role as if she were a spoiled Valley Girl.

","Pirates 2 was the second film which means that it was bound to be darker than the first film (see The Two Towers, Empire Strikes Back, Temple of Doom, Godfather 2 etc...). Unfortunately those responsible for the film felt it necessary to make it darker in a totally unnecessary way. The film was rife with dark spiritualism. One of the characters is some sort of voodoo woman with an upside-down cross hanging in her swamp house. I was OK with film one and the semi ghost story thing but what in the world is the point of taking mild fantasy and adding the element of religious spiritualism. This was too much. I went to Pirates 2 to have some fun and see some swashbuckling. It ended up being uncomfortably dark from a spiritual standpoint. In my opinion totally without any point. It was enough that it more than counterbalanced the ""fun"" aspect of the film."

The storyline was boring and didn't draw you in like the first installment. The acting was either uninspired (Bloom and Knightly) or so over the top (Depp of course, and the woman who plays the voodoo priestess) that it bordered on being a parody of itself. I would have felt better if a representative from the Disney corp. was at the theater and said, ""Give me thirteen dollars and I'll save you the trouble."" Its a testament to how much crap is out there when this giant floating hunk of garbage makes 300 mill. Clearly Disney has signed a pact with Satan himself to get people to see this.

This movie was great, plain and simple. Even better than the original, in my opinion. And I didn't even like the original that much, I just saw it for Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly (yow!). But this time, there's a lot more to see than good ol' Johnny and Keira.<br/><br/>Yup, a lot more.<br/><br/>First off, the story pacing is a lot slower and steady. Something I loved very much. We explore the changes in character with Elizabeth, Will, and Jack even more (with two new recruits as the comic reliefs), with bits of comedy and incredible action here and there. While I thought the Skeleton Barbossa from the original was okay, the new one (the squid-like Davy Jones) actually felt pretty intimidating and incredibly 'wow' to look at. The same goes for the rest of the crew, the makeup effects are incredibly top notch.<br/><br/>The movie takes its time in telling the story, letting you soak into the characters and beautiful scenery. Gore and his team have a good eye, through realistic landscapes, makeup, and even with CGI (which is rare nowdays for people who heavily abuse CG).<br/><br/>The music seems a little better too, Hans Zimmer seems to carry the soundtrack on with more of an epic beat this time (and doesn't let it drag like it did in the original). The Pirates' theme sounds a lot more ""adventerous"" this time, the new beat really helps enhance the movie even further than I could've imagined.<br/><br/>The action was one of the things that surprised me the most. They somehow managed to top themselves every time a major action scene comes up.

","Like most of the planet, I loved the original Pirates film. This film however was not a worthy sequel. Plot ? There isn't one. I could put spoilers in this review, but it would make no difference as the plot is essentially a device to go from one CGI scene to another. It's a shame when there is acting talent available, big budgets but the most important thing - a story - is completely missing. I would advise anyone with more than 2 brain cells to avoid seeing this film; and as for other reviewers who have compared it to ""The Empire Strikes Back"", I'll have some of what you are on, because you must be out of your mind. This is at least as bad as the second Matrix film, which says it all; if I could have walked out without upsetting my 10 year old daughter, I would have done.

The Davey Jones character is very inventive and portrayed wonderfully by Bill Nighy. This is the kind of movie I go to the theater to see. Definitely big screen, big sound. I like to get lost for a few hours and this movie certainly does the trick. It is a bit much for young kids though so I would definitely heed the PG-13 rating.

I am sure I will be going at least that many times again with this installment.

"joanna-szabo","10","14","24","8 July 2006"," The best movie ever! Hilariously exciting. The theater was resounding with laughter.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is officially my favorite movie. Captain Jack Sparrow is crazier and more lovable than ever, and Will and Elizabeth have returned as lovebirds once more. Unfortunate, true, why Will must seek out Jack, but the nearly the entire movie was hilarious. You can tell that the actors (Johnny Depp in particular)had a lot of fun in the making of this movie. The first part in the movie that got the theater to rumble with laughter was when Lord Beckett was reading out the crimes of Capt. Jack. He used the name ""Jack Sparrow"". Both Elizabeth and Will immediately say, ""CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow"". That was honestly hilarious. This movie was indeed darker than the last. Jack's happy mood was somewhat subdued, especially after the visit from Will's father, Bootstrap Bill. Bootstrap had a message from Davy Jones, legendary captain of the undersea/above sea phantom ship: The Flying Dutchman. If you're still wondering why Jack is so wary and nervous, it is because, 13 years ago, Jack made a deal with Davy Jones. If Davy Jones brought back the Black Pearl from the sea, in 13 years time, Jack would owe his soul to Davy Jones. A fate not easily accepted by Jack. While Will is off looking for Jack, Jack is running from Davy Jones. He somehow becomes the god of cannibals. Which, I'm sure he would enjoy very much if the cannibals weren't going to try to release the god's spirit from his body by roasting him alive and eating him. Elizabeth escapes from jail, and joins Jack's crew, along with the former Commodore Norrington. Will is traded into Davy Jones' crew, and the movie is a mass of fun and excitement, as well as a little treachery. (Elizabeth.) That's the one not-so-great part in the movie. I mean, it's necessary and all for the 3rd movie, but I did not really expect Elizabeth to trick Jack so that she could, in a nutshell, murder him. Not by her own hand, perhaps, but somebody else's. Well, somebody else's tentacles. But, rest assured, Captain Jack Sparrow will be back. There will never be a dull moment with him around, and Will and Elizabeth will do anything and everything to get him back to the world of the living. With, unfortunately, Barbossa's help. Well, folks, it's time to just watch the movie over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over.....(You get the point) and wait for the third movie, ""At World's End"". I sincerely hope that you enjoyed this movie, and if you did not........well, that sucks for you, because it is the definition of awesome! Heck, yes, GO CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW! See everybody in the cinemas next summer!"

The first movie was in my opinion way way better - it was fresh and had character. This was in my mind some hack attempt to follow up... not looking forward to the next one .. well maybe a little..

","*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS * *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br/><br/>When a sequel is coming for a successful film you can be sure that on one thing. The makers of the film will do their best to milk out the success of the original. This film is no different. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer and film distributor Walt Disney, have done that to the maximum. On it's way to the financial success of this film they managed to take any freshness from the first film and left us with one boring, long and chaotic film. Everything that was working to the advantage of the 1st film has become a disadvantage of this sequel. The characters are as shallow as the sea level after the high tide(and when you see they are credits for 4 writers for characters, one can wonder what were they paid for). The jokes are not working. The action sequences are too long and make the film longer than it actually is. Its 150 minutes playing time seems like eternity. You want the film to end but had to endure more and more of this nonsense. The script is full of holes and can be summarised in one sentence(as 2 of the characters do, somewhere in the film). The script and therefore the film has no logic and serve only as a point to promote the Disney's attraction its based upon. The film doesn't even try to explain why some of the things happened it basically says: That is how it is, live with it. You want logic, look somewhere else. The open ending(and not only ending-some plot-lines remain unresolved) suggest that this film is a long exposition for the 3rd installment of this franchise(logic when you know that part 2 en 3 were filmed simultaneously).<br/><br/>In 2 sentences: A waist of time and money. Ignore this film and you will be rewarded."

","When i saw the previews for this movie i automatically knew i would be disappointed once Davy Jones and his crew of fish men appeared. The movie began with Elizabeth siting in the rain, disappointed for some reason, the reason obviously different from the pair of arrest warrants? Then the movie moves too quickly causing you to run along with it. The movie lost the dark and quirky ambiance of the first movie, and is only quirky and silly, with the exception of the shack, with the fireflies--an allusion to the ride. Jack is no longer unpredictable like he was in the first movie, we can expect what he will do. When the movie was finished, i concluded i disliked the movie, decided it went nowhere, and believed since they are shooting the third installment continuously from the second, it will also be much of the same, ending either with Elizabeth's and Wills wedding day, or Elizabeth's and jacks wedding, with Will taking the form of jack as a pirate. Overall Johnny killed the character of Jack in this movie, i can only hope Jack will be different next time."

","It has a running time of approx 2 1/2 hours, and feels as though it runs for 5. By the end, I just didn't care for any of the characters; I merely wanted out of the cinema. There is no shape to the plot, which is simply a rag-tag of events that occur one after the other. It makes little sense because is it a collection of pirate clichÃ©s which pile on top of each other with no discernible pattern or logic (cannibals, sea monsters, a voodoo princess, peg legs, rum, sword fights, comedy intellectuals, bar brawls and so on). Characterisation is paper thin, and they all are highly unsympathetic - Bloom and Knightly as romantic leads are woefully inadequate and passionless for example. Depp's Jack Sparrow could have been the saving of the picture, but became highly annoying 5 minutes in and did not improve. Depp can light up the screen in some movies, but has become a collection of twitches and slurred lines with little direction in this one.<br/><br/>Vorbinski throws the kitchen sink into the mix, so I came out feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of pointless characters, plot twists, fights, explosions and CGI. Personally, I blame George Lucas for helping to create an industry where story, dialogue and sympathetic individuals are drowned in merchandising opportunities and effects shots, and a 2 1/2 hour movie can seemingly go on forever without point.<br/><br/>Count me out for ""Pirates 3: At movie's end"""

The character interaction was just not there, like part 1. Without giving anything away, I did see a couple new amusement park rides that will no doubt be out soon. I would compare this movie to Back to the Future 2 and Matrix 2, both of which had no real story line or reason for watching them, other then to lead up to part 3.

But the plot itself is not very engaging or interesting. The plot serves the special effects and the fight scenes rather than vice versa. it seems as if the movie was about what and how the actions took place, then a connector story was built to put all those special effect scenes together.

Is a summer adventure movie supposed to feel like this? I think not. This trio simply doesn't stand up to the greats I'm afraid- remember Luke, Han and Leia- 'nuff said.<br/><br/>I simply didn't have a great deal of fun watching this movie- everything seemed to contrived and cynical- big set pieces ham-fistedly tacked onto one of the most poorly developed story's I've come across in recent blockbusters. I went to see this with my bro and two friends- I and one of my buddies fell asleep about 3/4 of the way in for a good 5 or 10 minutes only to wake up to find that nothing had changed, still the same boring, joyless movie. All 4 of us were deeply disappointed come the end.<br/><br/>Even the comedy fell short of the mark. Depp did his best, but didn't have same quality material to work with this time around.

If they had cut away one hour of meaningless effects and never ending action sequences the movie would have been watchable. Johnny Depp was really in character but even his character was too busy running around to showcase his personality. Finally, this movie is not a movie, it is a part 1 of 2 series that just stops in the middle of nowhere. There is no ending, just a ""see you in two years when you have to pay another 10 bucks to see the ending"".

"Gubby-Allen","1","15","27","8 July 2006"," As bad as the first film was good.
","Sums it up really. The first film was completely original & a refreshing change and while the sequel - indeed any sequel - by definition can never have that trait, they can at least retain some of the values of the first film.<br/><br/>This was appalling drivel & I'm staggered so many have rated it as high as the first. What were you watching? Sparrow's character was one of the greatest in movie history. It was nothing here, he lacked any of the charisma or lines of the original and to paraphrase another critic here the ""seem like an honest man, tell lies, and really be honest at heart"" characterisation was flogged to death. Knightley seemed far too cocky in her role and Bloom was given a lot of screen time for a plot which never bordered on interesting. Although the latter could've been avoided had they merely removed the entire 45 minute tribesman / island scene near the beginning which served absolutely no point to the rest of the film whatsoever.<br/><br/>Whereas in the original the plot was simple & yet brilliantly effective this was a complete mess & merely a selection of incoherent & unnecessary scenes lumped together and seemingly decided on 1) how much they cost to film & 2) how loud they were as opposed to whether they added anything to the film at all.<br/><br/>The target audience seemed completely different to the first. The original seemed to be written towards intelligent adults but with consideration to younger viewers. I mean no offence here, but I got the feeling 90% of this was aimed at the average three year old, bar the concept of Davy Jones which would be asking a bit for a 12 or 13 year old to take on board first time. If you'd gone more than a couple of minutes without a good line or scene (which it frequently did) throw in a few ""man gets hit on head with rock"" or ""man trips over"" gags & all will be forgotten. Granted in my cinema they got a few laughs, but they sounded like children's laughs in comparison to the original.<br/><br/>I'd accumulated about 250 questions & points I was unsure of within the first half hour and while some were answered later on (too late usually - as you'd got past caring) the key points were usually glossed over so quickly, presumably so the plot holes & plot jumps were not questioned. Much of this was brought about by too many characters in the film as a whole, particularly early on.<br/><br/>A good sequel IMO, is one where you imagine the original had never existed and this was it instead. Regardless of whether the plot is better or worse does it still offer the originality & core values of the first film. This never came close. The plot was dull & sacrificed for noise & effects & the characters had nothing likable about them. The major ones never evolved at all, the minor ones just recycled the same gags & lines from the first film, which were great then but not again.<br/><br/>I still await the 3rd film with anticipation. There's every chance it could be another classic like the original, especially if they take on board the faults of this one. Lets hope Pirates of the Caribbean follows in the mould of Die Hard with two classic films at ever end, with a pointless one sandwiched between them.<br/><br/>Sorry but 1/10 - no redeeming qualities at all."

","I rated this movie as a 1 out of 10 only because 1 was the lowest optional number, otherwise this movie, if one can call it that, deserves a zero. I'm inclined to question this ""film's"" authenticity as a real movie because movies are actually supposed to have plots. A plot includes a beginning, a middle and an end. An end does not just mean, OK let's throw some confusing crap at the audience then show the credits, it means a conclusion. This movie had no such conclusion. I understand that this is because there is going to be a third movie. but, if they had done a better editing job and not made the movie a painful 2.5 hours long, they could have put both the 2nd and 3rd ""movies"" together and given it a satisfying ending. this movie was just a teaser for the 3rd. it was a scam to get money, and that's it. Watching a trilogy is supposed to be enjoyable. like Lord of the rings or star wars, or even batman, though those movies sucked mostly. POTC wasn't enjoyable. it was boring. the acting sucked. the movie makers overcompensated with special effects in place of reliable and relevant themes. what happened to good plots, and good stories that unearth the depths of human emotion? movie makers have out done themselves, and now they just rely of special effects to make money. creating those special effects must be difficult, but not as difficult as it is to write a truly meaningful story. this movie made me so angry. it wasted 2.5 hours of my life that i will never get back. and now I HAVE to see the third one, otherwise i'll never get this bitterness out of my soul. why did they do this??? Walt Disnet rolled over in his grave when this shitty movie premiered. mickey mouse was created to entertain and to bring joy to people, not to scam them out of their money."

","I went to see this movie Saturday of its opening weekend expecting a great movie. Having seen Superman Returns the night before, this movie was a total bore. The movie went nowhere. I don't think there was one part where I really laughed or really enjoyed part of it. It was very canned viewing, very stereotypical pirate/island fantasy story. The whole sequence with the natives was absurd, and hugely playing upon other movies with island natives, no original thought( I know this was a movie but I couldn't help notice the large rock formations and high cliffs that are definitely reminiscent of Thailand or Indonesia, definitely NOT the Carribbean.) There was no real flow to the movie. The plot was sorta there, get the compass, get the key...not gonna spoil it, but it seemed like it was too simply executed. The creatures on The Flying Dutchman were totally stupid, Urchinboy, blowfish man...etc. The only character or actor for that matter with any merit was Bootstrap Bill Turner played by Stellan Skarsgard. While I'm on the topic of actors sorry to all those 13yr old Orlando Bloom fans, but HE SUCKS! He can't carry a lead role in a film, that's why ""Kingdom of Heaven"" did so poorly( what could have been a great film with Ridley Scott and Liam Neeson).Johnny Depp's character was not nearly as good from the first movie, he must have said ""Bugger!"" 30 times. All in all it was too thin of a movie with Michael Bay's best in fake action and CGI. Keira Knightley someone with a good deal of talent had too few scenes, including probably the best of the movie, the bar fight. This movie is nowhere close to the original. It seems its only use is as a minor conveyance to the next PIRATES Movie.All in all I was totally unimpressed, especially since 2 of the 6 of us who went FELL ASLEEP!"

","I'm sorry I thought this was just appalling; an overblown, flabby mess of a script, poorly (and derivatively) directed and badly executed all round. Worst thing about it: well, it seems to me to be 90% padding for the next in the series, rather than a decent outing in its own right.<br/><br/>The screenplay tries to do much in terms of developing all three main characters simultaneously (since two of them have as much talent and acting ability as planks of driftwood, I really fail to see the point). It tries and fails to combine added character depth with the pacey fun and action of the first. All are failures. Moreover Depp, the main draw as Capt'n Jack, has become a mere caricature; a shade of the fine actor he once was.<br/><br/>All in all the film is tedious: the cinematography overblown (and yes I am taking into account that this is a brash, nay garish sort of genre anyway), and surprisingly the cgi is very poor in places, though not the close up shots of Nighy, that is all unquestionably excellent. In fact Nighy and Davenport are the only saving graces for the whole thing but as character parts with limited screen time they can't do much to save the disaster.<br/><br/>In the words of the great William Goldman ""Sequels are whore films"". There are exceptions (you all know about the Godfather Part II), but without a doubt sequels do sell their souls: made with less integrity, originality and energy,for the singular purpose of extracting more money: milking the cash cow until it's sore udders drop off! So if you want to see Knightly flounce and pout her way across the seas be my guest. Oh by the way her character has given up any pretence at feminism, unless of course it's the only real feminism Hollywood has ever systematically credited female leads with (looking pretty, spouting double entendres and being able to kick ass), Bloom mopes around like a kicked puppy and Depp just looks uncomfortable and sullied.

Missing from the film was the charm and dry witty humor of the first, which was sadly replaced only by rum jokes.

Johnny Depp was enough to keep the film alive, however, this gets old as the film progresses since we are already familiar with Jack Sparrow from the first film. Kira Knightly (very wonderful girl) has done another great job with her character and her facial expressions are among the best to communicate without words. Again, another pretty dull role for Bloom (in fact - not good at all!!). Average special effects A big thumbs up to the editors and to Gore Vabinski on their good part.

"madam_Q","8","10","17","29 July 2006"," Great fun, not without its flaws
","Middle installments of trilogies often tend to suffer, especially when the original was not necessarily made with a sequel in mind. There are, however, exceptions to the rule. Put ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on the opposite side of the sequel coin to ""Matrix Reloaded"" - there most decidedly IS a precedent for second films emerging from the shadows of their predecessors.<br/><br/>Thus my hopes when I went in to see ""Dead Man's Chest"" were reasonably high. The fact that all of the original cast had returned, along with quality additions like Stellan Skarsgard and Bill Nighy, only buoyed my optimism. And surely Johnny Depp wouldn't have let himself be pulled into any old crap, contractual obligation or no.<br/><br/>Like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" this is a considerably darker affair than the all out fun of the original. The themes dealt with here are more somber - betrayals and double crossings are commonplace even among the good guys, and issues of mortality dealt with by Davey Jones and his crew make them far more frightening than the villains of the original - indeed, Barbossa and his men look almost cartoonish by comparison. There are some real scares here, and this is definitely not a film that I'd recommend to parents with young children, bladder busting running time aside.<br/><br/>Not to say its all gloom and doom. Definitely not. The visual effects are virtually flawless, and the action set pieces - particularly a three way sword fight between Jack, Will and Norrington while Elizabeth throws a temper tantrum (not to mention rocks) on the sidelines is fantastic. The script is great, not only containing a good measure of great one liners (of which Captain Jack predictably gets the lion's share) but also real deepening of relationships between the characters. Jack and Elizabeth in particular. Ragetti and Pintel are great fun, trading on their great rapport like they did in the original, and Norrington finally gets to be something other than a ""prat in a wig"" (as the lovably self deprecating Jack Davenport described himself in a magazine interview).<br/><br/>Inevitably, it lacks the freshness and the ""wow"" factor of the original. But there's nothing the filmmakers could have done to avoid that. Because, lets face it, nobody expected the original to be as successful as it was. A Disney flick based on a theme park ride starring Edward Scissorhands, Legolas and the skinny chick from ""Bend it Like Beckham""? Who knew? Pleasingly, though, there's no sense of anybody resting on their laurels - in particular I had dreaded Jack's antics skirting into caricature territory but Depp is, of course, far too ""savvy"" an actor to fall into that trap.<br/><br/>The ending, like that of ""Back to the Future Part II"", is predictably a cliffhanger ensuring that everybody and their dog (or monkey) will drag themselves back to see part three, but oddly the feeling of being manipulated is somehow all part of the fun. And if part three is even anywhere near the quality of part two....we're in for an awesome ride..."
"gmellen-1","1","10","17","26 July 2006"," astonishingly awful
","Contains spoilers. This feels like the longest movie I have ever seen, but not in a good way. I believe it was Roger Ebert who once said about another movie, ""if anything can happen, then who cares what happens"". He could have been talking about Pirates II. In order to save Cap'n Jack, er, get the love birds married, er, save Will Turner's Dad, er, whatever, we have to retrieve that, no wait, we have to find this, no wait, we have to kill that, no wait, we have to go there, no wait, we have to save that guy... Instead of sunny seafaring scenes (it's the Caribbean, remember), most of the movie is grimly dark and caked with creepy sea gunk. Okay, it's Davey Jones locker, we get it. Move on. Sea gunk is not that entertaining. Even the very fine actors Stellan Skarsgard and Bill Nighy are buried beneath layers of special movie pirate goo in wasted performances (you can almost see them asking to be rescued from this dreck). So there's plenty of ""piratey"" atmosphere, but I didn't care about any of it because I didn't care about any of the characters. Characters and plot lines appear and then are quickly forgotten or replaced by others, and I have watched deodorant commercials with better character development. The Kraken (sp?) attacks three times (one time, scary, two times, interesting, three times, yawn...) During the third attack, (which is the longest of the three segments), does the director really think that we believe, despite all the crashing timbers and grasping octopus tentacles, that any of the main characters are going to die? Not bloody likely, and yet the segment goes on and on and on and on... Then suddenly, game over in a naked setup for episode #3. Turns out, in order to find out what happens to Cap'n Jack, you'll have to wait a year and fork over another $9.50 (uh, der, he's the main character!). Writers and directors that disrespect their audiences this profoundly should be forced to get real jobs. Johnny Depp gamely attempts to redeem the movie by taking his character way over the top, but clearly understands what nonsense is afoot. Avoid this movie at all costs. See whatever is playing at the next theater or better yet, buy the DVD of ""Swashbuckler"" with Robert Shaw, Genevieve Bujold, Peter Boyle, and James Earl Jones for a real good-natured and entertaining pirate movie. Of course, now that Pirates II has made hundreds of millions of dollars, aimless and overblown will be the Hollywood formula for the next three years. The further tragic ""Bruckheimer-ization"" of Hollywood. Buckle up. I can only hope that Depp makes so much money from this movie and the sequel that he can afford to buy the studio and return it to some respectability and integrity."

There is no way this movie is above a 5 on any scale. I was a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean, and I love Disneyland - this one just failed to capture the swashbuckling and fun that the first one did. It just kind of dragged on for me to the point where I was ready to leave.<br/><br/>First off, the pacing and storytelling are just plain awful. There are entire 30-40 minute scenes of the movie that could have been deleted and there would be no effect on the coherency of the movie. Maybe they were there just to show how cool Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom were - but I didn't buy it. There are at least 5 different story lines, not one of which is really explained in any detail. There are also so many unexplained parts to the movie that you just wind up giving up and getting frustrated with it.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just jaded, but I couldn't find any suspense in this thing either. The focus is haphazard and you wind up not getting a feel for any of the characters. Johnny Depp, while a cool actor and character, I thought his character had no redeeming qualities about him. <br/><br/>The other characters are pretty forgettable, and the performances are mediocre. The relationships between the characters were rushed and superficial.I didn't find myself connecting with anyone at all, and I didn't feel the characters connected with each other on screen either.<br/><br/>This movie is total flash with about zero substance. If you love special effects and can overlook good character development, plot lines, and emotional development, this is the movie for you.

The fan-boys and girls of Depp and the Pirates franchise will ogle over it and things it's great, the rest of us who enjoy more than mindless action scenes will find it dull and forgettable.<br/><br/>Here's to hoping the third is better."
"the_scandal_cha","3","15","28","13 July 2006"," I appear to be the only one who didn't like this film...
","Everyone is going to think I'm crazy, but I really hated this film. I wasn't expecting much going into it, because I also disliked the first Pirates film. This one was worse. And why was it so bad? you may ask. I am a very picky person who does not enjoy most films anyway, so this is quite normal for me. The film simply tried too hard to make people like it. And you know what? For the most part, it worked. The film has lots and lots of action, and lots and lots of yelling. Lots and lots of ugly creatures, and lots and lots of the good-looking stars. There was never a dull moment. Aaaaaand that's why this film bored me so. The whole time I was in the theatre, I was thinking to myself, ""Calm down, Pirates movie! It's okay! The audience isn't going to walk out of the theatre if you take a breather!"" It was just too much. Too much of everything; trying way way too hard. Therefore, I was completely and utterly bored in the theatre, angry that I had come to see this silly little film. All I know is that at the end of the film, I really didn't care about what happened next...so much of everything went on EXCEPT any reason to like any one of the characters. I hated them all for being so one-dimensional. Action, yes. Likable characters, not to me. Maybe I just prefer the simple things in life, like the quiet."
"Nop-8","1","9","15","6 October 2006"," What a heap of trash
","Looking at the previous, enthusiastic comments, I wonder whether I have actually seen the same movie. Dead mens chest doesn't even feel like a movie but rather like a sequence of unrelated short episodes crudely forced together. I'd say that the plot holes were large enough to sail the whole of the Spanish Armada through if the movie even made any attempt to explain the nonsensical hops from one part to the other. Thinking about it, nothing in the plot makes any particular sense.<br/><br/>While the first movie had at least some of the swashbuckling adventure air you'd expect from a pirate flick, I found it lacking from the static and mostly dark settings of this one, felt more like a bad horror movie afloat on a studio pool. The special effects are professionally done, but as usual these days they are way overdone. I still wonder why the flying dutchman, originally a legendary ghost, had to look like Cuthullu with a hat. As for laughs and entertainment, I simply fell asleep about one hour into the movie.<br/><br/>I recommend that anybody who likes classic pirate movies or has any knowledge about what a real ship sails like should not make himself suffer through this one."
"brincadeira","1","9","15","11 August 2006"," Depressing
","If you take the first Pirates of the Caribbean and do a complete flip flop, you have the second movie. In other words whatever was happy is sad and depressing in this movie. Jack seemed to be a different person in this movie, except that they used a lot of the same humor as the first movie. There is no happy ending in this movie and actually there is no ending, which I disliked most of all. There were a lot of cheesy parts to this movie and even more unrealistic. I loved the first movie you can almost say yeah that is some what realistic, but this is just plain unrealistic. I wasted my money and wish that I would have known. If anything, I would suggest waiting till the third movie comes out, listen to the reviews and if the third movie is good then rent the second movie and watch the third."
"Reel_World","1","9","15","27 July 2006"," Waste of time and money
","So I enjoyed the first Pirates film quite a lot. Depp brought something fresh and original to the character of Jack Sparrow. This film, clocking in at just under 3 hours in length is probably one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. Gone was the whimsical charm of the first film. Orlando Bloom is quickly proving how limited his acting ability is, and Keira Knightley just doesn't do it for me anymore. The special effects were very good (props to ILM as always on that) but it felt like the Star Wars franchise had overtaken the proceedings with Davey Jones and his crew being a load of over CGI'ed mutant forms of Jar Jar Binks. I recall seeing the initial preview for this film and thinking ""What's the deal with the hammerhead looking thing?"" and worrying that the film would be a mess of CGI monsters and the like. I was right. The plot was literally all over the place, the characters weren't nearly as likable as in the previous film, and the running time was painfully long. Even my two nephews who I took to see the film thought it was only ""OK"".... I seriously think I will not see the third one in the series, and my DVD rack will stay with only the one Pirates movie in the collection."

","No actions scenes that could even compare to the first movie. The first ""Pirates"" was face-paced and action packed and laced with fantastic one-liners. This movie had to rely on your knowledge of the first movie to pull of its one liners ""why is the rum always gone"" It wasn't that witty and lacked action. They developed way too much of a story line for this movie and it went no where. It appeared the sole purpose of this movie was to make money and set up for the third movie.<br/><br/>Reminded me of Star Trek III the search for Spock.

This is not even ""popcorn fun"" as the most probable thing is that you will throw up).<br/><br/>I thought about leaving after the first half hour but thought that it would get better; but when I saw many others leave mid-way, I followed them...<br/><br/>I find it very strange that so many people give it 9s and 10s.

","After the first ""Pirates,"" I was very excited to see the second. What a letdown. First, it is entirely too long. 2 1/2 hours is too long for most movies, and in this case, the movie feels as if it is 4 hours long. It has been a long time since I wanted so badly for a movie to end.<br/><br/>Second, it is a very dark movie. Disturbingly dark. The lighthearted banter and adventurous feel of the first movie is nowhere to be found. Spiritually, it has very dark themes, and it left me with a creepy sort of dark, depressive feeling - not what I desired or expected, after the humor of the first movie. The dialog is much too gloomy, and unlike the first movie, there are no great lines to be found. All the good ones are in the previews. There was nothing to add.<br/><br/>Finally, parts of the movie are entirely too disgusting. I was disgusted and put off by several scenes. Any fun there might be in the movie is overshadowed by grotesque and gratuitous parts that were extremely distasteful.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a terrible disappointment. I liken in to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,"" another disappointing second movie in a trilogy. I can only hope the third movie, like in the Indiana Jones trilogy, comes to the rescue of this series."

"mad_elaine","1","8","13","17 July 2006"," wretched, worthless waste of your time
","For a sequel to a basically fun and swashbuckling first offering, this one is completely UNfunny, aggressively puerile and offensive, disjointed and confusing in its direction, and has nothing at all to offer but gross-out scenes and a tired parade of pirate-movie clichés. Five year olds could have come up with a more cohesive and entertaining script, and certainly could have written something less disgusting. A hodgepodge of gratuitous scenes that can't distract the viewer away from the fact that they have yet to be given any reason to care about any of these characters or events. NO humor whatsoever, and for something so poorly glued together, it takes itself way too seriously. The first one didn't even try to be serious, knowing everything was silly fantasy, but the tone this one tries to keep is that this is actually straightforward and not tongue-in-cheek! As it jumps abruptly from one ludicrous scene to another, it fails to make any sense or entice the viewer. Constipated overacting, ham fisted direction, and if it has a plot, you won't see any sign of it for a good long time. My husband and I walked out after a totally unpleasant half hour and got a refund. Don't waste two hours of your life. This is the typical sequel scenario, where they KNOW most everyone who saw the first will see the second, so they don't even bother trying to make it good. I used to have respect for Johnny Depp, but I guess he was either contractually obligated to do a sequel, or just sold out for a buck. He's not really the problem here; it's the lousy writing and direction."

"martin-dench","1","8","13","12 July 2006"," What a waste of an evening!
","Okay, I know loads of people love this film, and I went to see it with the full intention of enjoying it. But I couldn't. As far as I could tell it was rambling, incoherent and it was hard to understand what everyone except Bloom and Knightley were saying. And the film can't make it's mind up as to whether it's comedy or gross-out horror. In the UK it has one of those farcical '12A' certificates, and I have to say that there is no way I'd consider letting my two children (8 and 6) see it - they'd be really disturbed by so much of what goes on. Which doesn't make it bad film-making (it's the bad film-making that does that!), but does make the whole issue of certification very questionable.<br/><br/>Depp is back as the ambivalent Sparrow, mincing and wearing make-up for all he's worth. Bloom and Knightley are there as well as the star-crossed, rather dull, lovers. And all the others are there too, including Jack Davenport to add an 'interesting' third way to the film. Their performances are all OK, but then again this isn't 'Come And See', one shouldn't expect ground-breaking thespianism.<br/><br/>I know it's only a film, only a story, but I was bemused by the whole Flying Dutchman thing. I thought it was fairly well known that the legendary captain of the Flying Dutchman was a Dutch sailor called Van Der Decken. Maybe Davy Jones sounded easier for the mushed-out brains of Hollywood's perceived target audience to understand. But I was disappointed - Van Der Decken sounds far more mysterious. And how come that someone with a name like 'Davy Jones' sounds so darned Scottish? I think you can tell I didn't like it. I thought the film was aimless, chaotic, rambling and totally annoyed me by leaving us with a cliffhanger ending that I really didn't care about. I was very angry about that actually. I had no idea and was fed up that I'd wasted an evening watching a film I didn't really like that didn't even have a satisfactory ending.<br/><br/>But I guess that any film based on a Disney theme park ride is never going to be high art. I did quite like the first film (although the sword fights went on for far too long), but I really do believe this film is a mess, confusing and non-sensical. But, I suspect many of those who loved the first one will enjoy this and the prospect of more to come. But, the cynic in me can't help feeling that much of the popularity of this film (borne out by the presence in the cinema of so many teenage girls) is due at least in part to the presence of Messrs. Bloom and Depp.<br/><br/>Shiver me timbers!"

Davey Jones and his crew wore on and on a little too much for me, but other than that no complaints. Johnny Depp is hilarious and you can not get enough of his antics in this film.

","Did anybody edit this movie??? I have never seen more attempts at grandeur fall so flat. They threw the baby out with the bath water on this one.<br/><br/>This movie was mostly a 2 and 1/2 hour blur for me. There were times I could not even make out the dialog, much less follow the action scenes wet with stuff that cost too much to cut. It was WAY too long.<br/><br/>Was this movie intended to be silly or serious? I found it overall, incoherent. Perhaps I am one of the few who just did not 'get it' (or one of the few that did not see the emperor's new clothes). It had some humorous but overtly silly moments that made me laugh. It was rarely engaging.<br/><br/>The special effects were over-the-top, and in many instances, first rate. On the other hand, there were many scenes where the green screen was so obvious, I could figuratively puke. Aside from the expensive eye candy, this film did nothing for me. All told, maybe 20 minutes of entertainment at too high a cost.<br/><br/>This movie just goes out of its way to WOW you, but I keep thinking... 'what is going on?'. Perhaps the fact that the preceding movie took flight from my brain years ago might have contributed to this lack of understanding (that movie wasn't all it was cracked-up to be either). Still... should this movie not stand on its own? <br/><br/>I also think that this movie could be scary for children. Even as an adult, I found the characters aboard Davy Jone's ship somewhat disturbing. Not exactly stuff you market under the Disney brand (except for the silly stuff). I won't even address the racial biases this movie inadvertently promotes.<br/><br/>I will not fault Johnny Depp for participating in this atrocity, as he has already been grandfathered into the franchise. It is always fun to watch him, and he contributes some to the limited entertainment value of this film.<br/><br/>I expect that many movie goers who saw this on the big screen walked out with stars spinning around their heads... thinking they had seen a tremendous blockbuster. Really, they were just inundated with incoherent WOW and knocked over, not realizing that they had bumped their heads.<br/><br/>If you can, give it a miss. It will be time well not spent."

","Can it truly be so? Has Disney actually turned out a sequel that not only isn't totally horrible, but is actually as, or even more, amazing than the first? As much as I enjoyed (fanatacized over) the first Pirates of the Caribbean, I honestly approached this one with caution, since Disney isn't exactly known for ground-breaking movie sequels. I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least! The actors and their characters were brilliant (obviously, Johnny Depp can do no wrong, as he INVENTED brilliancy on screen), colorful, and developed (once again, surprisingly so). The plot successfully remained constant with the first movie without depending solely on ""inside jokes"" and references. One doesn't necessarily have to see the previous movie to enjoy this film, although it infinitely enhances the experience. I give this film a perfect 10 because from the moment the film started to the very end--nay, hours and hours later--my jaw was either gaping or in a gigantic toothy smile. The special effects were amazing, the action was thrilling. The few gruesome or violent scenes were well-crafted and delightfully ridiculous, helping to form a movie perfect for all ages (ok, maybe not like reeeeally little kids). I recommend this movie to anyone who: a)has a healthy love of pirates, b)wants a film saturated with non-stop action and swashbuckling without the haughty seriousness of other recent adventure movies (a good contrast would be the too-serious ""Master and Commander"") or c)loves beautiful people in beautiful costumes in powerful scenes with ground-breaking special effects. Bon voyage!!<br/><br/>! ! STOP READING NOW IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE ! !<br/><br/>Ahem, I do feel like this comment should include at least one critique, and it is one that I think I share with other Johnny Depp fans around the world. I'm only saying that I was a little disappointed in the turn of such events; specifically, a certain intimate embrace between a certain cinematic sex icon and a certain young Knightly. Isn't there some tacit law against low, new talent making out with that demi-god? There should be. Also, I thought the bayou scenes could have been a little more imaginative. The mourners looked suspiciously like runaway slaves. Maybe that was the intention, but they could have turned it into something more than that, I think."

","I remember when the first ""Pirates"" movie ended, and I thought, ""What an amazing surprise this film was."" Great characters, performances, plot twists, and humor... it was one of the best studio ""popcorn"" movies in recent memory, transcending that very label. It also didn't have a made-for-sequel ending, but it was one of those rare feature films that make you thirsty to see another adventure. The second installment, ""Dead Man's Chest,"" however, is not even a full movie. Its running time is too much, and its content is too little. It's a bloated, campy set-up for next year's finale. This is to say that there was no need for this portion of the story at all, and as an audience member, I'm offended. The filmmakers had such potential to make a great trilogy, or even a longer ongoing series of great adventures... but this latest film misses the target, sinks in the water, and disappoints on nearly all levels except for production value. Of course the film is slick... they have a ton of money and the absolute finest people in Hollywood working on this film. But that's why it is so disappointing to see such a chaotic piece of garbage. I found this film confusing, and any parts that were vaguely understandable were understandable only because they were identical to the story of the first film. For example, it's about a haunted, grisly crew in search of the treasure that will set them free. Sound familiar? It could've been called ""Curse of the Flying Dutchman,"" referring to the new haunted ship's name. Why were they disgusting squid-like sea creatures? How did Sparrow get to be worshiped by those tribes people, and what did that entire sequence have to do with any of the film anyway? Additionally, Sparrow's character was not nearly as much fun to watch. He seemed more of a bumbling (and more effeminate) fool this time around, rather than an enigmatic charlatan who's always got something up his sleeve, whether he realizes it or not, like in the first ""Pirates"" movie. The humor seemed more juvenile and silly in this film, as well, and didn't have the kind of fun-for-all-ages spirit of the first movie. A few great sequences, such as the duel on the uncontrollable water wheel, stand out as redeeming moments. Overall, the ""half-film"" disappoints and has this movie-goer reluctantly considering to boycott the next film. Take a hint from ""Back to the Future,"" which had three distinct, wonderfully interconnected yet self- resolving episodes, leaving an absolutely fantastic trilogy. That potential no longer stands for ""Pirates of the Caribbean."""

As Will sets off to track down his acquaintance, Sparrow has his own problems. The deal he made with Davy Jones all those years ago is due and Jones himself is coming to settle the debt. Meanwhile Elizabeth's father arranges for her escape and she sets out to find Jack and Will.<br/><br/>Having enjoyed the first film and applauded the Oscar nomination for Depp, I was looking forward to more of the same and went to see this film on the fist weekend. I was slightly on edge because of having of having to share a cinema with a group of chavs determined not to let anyone forget they were at the back, but settled into it. The opening of the film is rather heavy as it sets up the plot and it does rather lack the fun that the first film had  which is sadly how much of it turns out to be. It doesn't really help that the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense at times and that the film is too long but generally the main problem is that at times it forgets that first and foremost it is supposed to be entertaining. Others have wittily ripped of The Guardian newspaper by describing this as The Empire Strikes Jack, which is fine because it does have a good try at being dark and interesting, but it is at the expense of the fun.<br/><br/>It does have moments throughout the film that are funny and entertaining but it puts too much emphasis on the plot (which isn't that great) and the darker tone. The latter is a problem then because the first film never took itself that seriously so it is a bit jarring as an audience member to be expected to suddenly buy into this film as the second part in a dark, sea-faring trilogy. The direction is still good and visually the film is very impressive; the sets, costumes and make-up are very convincing and the special effects look like every penny was spent (but they also merge well into the film and don't stand out for their own sake). Depp is as good as he was in the first film but here is sidelined by the many other characters and threads. It is a real shame and a big reason why it feels less fun than before  he has less to do and less to work with. Bloom is rather wooden and history may well remember him (assuming it does) as someone who lucked their way into two massive trilogies of the time before fading away. This may be a bit cruel but his performance isn't anything special and he is totally in Depp's shadow. Knightley is a bit better because she is feisty and fun. Nighy is a great addition  not only for his character but also for his performance, which is fun and slightly menacing; god only knows what the film would have been like without him because he does steal many of the scenes. Support from Skarsgård, Crook, McNally, Pryce, Davenport and others is mostly good but really the film could have done with a few characters and threads being scaled back to make for a brisker and pacier film. Harris was a surprise find and I was impressed she still managed to be sexual while under very ugly makeup.<br/><br/>Overall then this is an OK summer film but those that loved the irreverent sense of fun of the original will probably feel a bit let down. It is still a solid film and the dark edge makes for a more rounded film  albeit not one that I actually wanted but still a good one. Visually it is amazing and I was never really bored at any point but I would have liked it have been a bit more fun than it was and also for the darker stuff to have had a bit more substance."

","Its a piece of sh*t made for money and nothing more. The action is so slow and predictable, so you actually see the producers laughing and counting their money. Of course I should have thought of that but I really felt betrayed. There are so many weird imaginative stories in the film, but it feels unnatural. At the end you can say nothing really happened. <br/><br/>Don't think I am generally negative. The first film in 2003 was something wonderful. I readily voted with 10 for it. I would say its worse than the things with The Matrix and its sequels... <br/><br/>After such a bad 2nd part I definitely wont go to the 3rd coming soon."

The side stories didn't make sense its almost if they rushed the entire movie. You will only enjoy this film if you like: 2 and half hours of pointless crap, Old Jokes, Sea Monsters trying to be like pirates and Orlando Blooms terrible acting.

","I was really concerned when I went to see this movie last night (midnight showing) that I wasn't going to like it at all. All the critics had panned it and other people's reviews I had read did not give compelling reasons for liking it.<br/><br/>However, it turned out that this movie is waaaaay better than the critics claim. It's only drawback is that it is long and a few scenes could have been worked out. Despite this, I loved the action sequences and I didn't at all find the plot to be razor thin by any means. What I think this movie is suffering from is critic's bologna. These are the same people who claimed Spider-Man 2 was the greatest superhero movie ever made. It's great but not the best (in fact I got kinda bored through it). The point being that since they hold that sequel to such a high standard they have since panned all other attempts by other franchises.<br/><br/>The plot to POTC:DMC is actually quite similar to the first in scope and execution but it is no way a repeat. Gore Verbinski does a great job again at the helm of direction and the music by Hans Zimmer goes very well with the action sequences. And the ending is a nice set up to the third movie due out next year. I was not ""overstimulated"" as one critic has put it and I never found any of the returning main characters to be annoying or less than what they were before. I think actually that Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley) is much more real character now than she was in the first. I honestly believed this time that she was more than just a pretty governor's daughter.<br/><br/>My advice: definitely go see it. The critics have no idea what they're talking about. I think I might even like this one more than the first, which is saying a lot since I loved the first one a great deal.<br/><br/>9/10"

"The_Film_Cricket","2","2","2","23 March 2014"," Too much, just too much
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is a traffic jam at the plot factory, a movie so overwritten that even when it's over it's not over. Or let me put it this way, the plot is so complicated that it is going to take yet another movie to finish what this movie started. I learned almost too late that this movie is actually the center piece of a trilogy and I pity the writers of that film who have to untie the knots from this one.<br/><br/>Steamrolling along at a running time of nearly three hours here is a movie visually made for the big screen but on DVD will make you thank the heavens for a rewind button. There is a LOT of story here and I think I understood only about 40% of it. The plot threads that I could untangle were kind of intriguing. Captain Jack Sparrow, we learn, owes a blood debt to the legendary Davy Jones, the spectrally captain of The Flying Dutchman whose crew is made up of men who are doomed to serve him for a certain term until their time is up. Time is running out, we learn, and he has to find a way out of his debt or he will serve the fishy captain for all eternity.<br/><br/>We also learn that he is a wanted man in just about every port you can name. That screws up the wedding plans of his former matey Will Turner and blushing bride Elizabeth Swann when they are charged with death because of their association with him in their last adventure. Meanwhile Will learns that is father Bootstrap Bill is doing time on Jones' ship and sets out to rescue him. Meanwhile there's some business of a compass that will lead to a key that leads to a Dead Man's Chest that contains the still beating heart of Davy Jones. Meanwhile there's the evil Culter Beckett back in England who wants the key to find Jones' heart. These are the more coherent plot threads and there are a lot more but I honestly had to work to untangle them The plot threads are set up, some pay off and some do not and some we care about and some we don't. But the movie overloads us with one development and back-twist after another until we settle into the realization that these plot elements are not advancing on a narrative but are stringing together one megazilla action sequence after another. By the end we're so worn down that the emotional investment that we're suppose to have is washed out.<br/><br/>Technically the movie is brilliant. Amid the mish mash of a plot I must observe the film's one astonishingly brilliant element and that would be Davy Jones. Jones is an astonishing technological marvel, a creature so unholy but so technically beautiful that the magicians who brought him to life should congratulate themselves. Here is a creature with a beard made of tentacles and the tentacles undulate this way and that all independently of one another, they all seem to have a life of their own. His Scottish brouge is an original, he doesn't just hiss and squish but his voice has texture and you sense a personality there. When he smokes, his skins expands and retracts. There is a scene in which he sits in the bowels of his ship playing the organ with his tentacles in which I really grinned, the scene isn't necessary to the plot but I loved the generosity of the filmmakers to include it.<br/><br/>Jones' ship is a marvel as well, a scummy, drippy creation made of wood and bones this is part ship and part submarine. It is occupied by creatures who are half men half sea creatures including one who seems to have been cross-bred with a hammer-head shark and another creature that is melded with the hull of the ship. Alas, I was not as impressed with their chief weapon, a giant monstrous creature called The Kracken who is made of tentacles and teeth and capable of snapping a ship in half. There is a real threat when the creature attacks but there wasn't a wow factor to it, I kept thinking that when you've seen one tentacle you've seen them all and that Ray Harryhausen created a much more convincing Kracken for ""Clash of the Titans"" 25 years ago.<br/><br/>But technical achievements aside, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest ultimately is just too much, too long, too overcomplicated and too meandering. I understand the necessity of trying to set up elements to be solved in POTC3 but I really would have preferred more coherance. The ending that is equal in cliffhanger status to The Empire Strikes Back but lack of narrative robs us of the emotional punch. Maybe after almost three hours I was so worn out and ready to go home that my investment had been dampened."

","Captain Jack (Depp) looks to square his debt with sea lord Davy Jones (Nighy) by finding his heart, but Will (Bloom) and Norrington (Davenport) are also after it.<br/><br/>The anticipated sequel to The Curse of the Black Pearl brings all the familiar faces back and none more expected than Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, the Oscar nominated hero from the first instalment, a fine and spontaneous creature with an unfathomable mind and a devilish heart who is sadly not in this film.<br/><br/>Depp (Edward Scissorhands) returns alright, but not as the man we loved from Black Pearl. Everything sadly about the character is wrong. The timing is off, the spontaneity has evaporated and everything about Captain Jack seems formulaic, as if conforming to the concept generated by the media, rather than the narrative. The franchise killed the character. The theme park ride increased, toys were made along with imitations present in films such as Epic Movie and somehow that got into the head of the much loved star. And it is the script above everything else that destroys this film, and our hero.<br/><br/>Curse of the Black Pearl worked so well because it was relatively simple. Sure the complex ideology of the Aztec gold had heads working overtime but the character story lines were basic but entertaining. Here there are too many additional protagonists, the effects are all over the place (Oscar winning or not they are too muddled and too in your face) and the political agenda enforced takes the shine of the pirate tale.<br/><br/>The additional Governors, villains and crew feel encoded for the vastness of the scenery rather than the significance of the plot. They are there to make the story feel huge, but oversteps into overwhelming and incomprehensible Yes the effects are fantastic. The Dutchman is visually stunning and the darkness of the first is given a vivid shake up by this depiction of evil pirates. However the story of Jones' love life and his protagonist in general bring the imagination down. His image too is way overdone. The skeletons in the previous film were just right for fantasy, but this feels like a sick nightmare rather than a legend of the sea.<br/><br/>The political madness ruins the fun and imagination of pirates and you have to wonder why this is even encoded in the first place.<br/><br/>Dead man's chest offers a computer generated sequel that is consistently poor with infrequent surprises and a tendency to attempt the far fetched when the simple mildness of the first would have sufficed."

Napoleon's greatness lies in his appreciation and acceptance of his lifetime blunder which effectively exploded the myth of his invincibility.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean is yet another visually loaded, graphically exploited, fictional absurdity and cinematic blunder effectively transforming sublimity into utter ridicule. The special effects department and the long list of art and makeup/costume designers have virtually crafted a sore not only for the eyes but for the souls of the audience as well.<br/><br/>Astonishingly, crass of this kind and magnitude is winning accolades from the majority of audience, because they are left with only this type of stuff to watch. Mediocrity and shallow fiction has overwhelmed the cinema and good movies have become a distant dream. The rapidly advancing motion camera and computer aided visual technology has incapacitated the aesthetic imagination and lively, vivacious portrayal of the incumbent directors, producers and screen writers. It seems, as if their sensibility and sensitivities have reached the rock bottom of human intellect.<br/><br/>Screening and portraying weird, clumsy, bizarre and creepy creatures to provide cosmetic effect to the movie testifies to stumpy intellect of these film makers.

"Dash_Rendar","8","2","2","19 October 2006"," Just barely misses the mark.
","The eight-star score is generous. Dead Man's Chest is definitely not a bad film, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't disappointed a little. It's always tough to create sequels to successful blockbusters and have them live up to original's name. The first ""Pirates"" film had a rare charm that most other Hollywood pictures would envy. Fantastic characters, a great story, amazing special effects, and an all-around ""fun"" feel. It's not hard to understand why it became so popular.<br/><br/>On paper, nothing really seems wrong with Dead Man's Chest. It has the same elements that made the first film a hit. Yet at the same time, something felt missing.<br/><br/>Two of the ""main three"" characters (Sparrow, Turner, and Swann) seemed to have experienced a personality makeover. Initially, all three characters are likable and you found yourself rooting for them through both good and bad intentions. That's not the case in DMC. Jack Sparrow and Elizabeth Swann both show their dark side and become devious, cowardly, and double-crossing individuals. Their actions are so despicable that even a movie audience will have a hard time justifying them. Will Turner, however, is still the same honorable and loyal gentleman that is the fish-out-of-water among cutthroat pirates. This leaves Turner as the only remaining likable character out of the ""main three."" On the other hand, there is one character change that I was pleasantly surprised with. Commodore Norrington. In the first film, he was a snobbish stiff that dedicated himself to capturing criminal scum and bringing them to justice (or execution). In DMC, an unfortunate twist of fate causes his character to do a 180* and become the very same scum he once fought to destroy. This spin is very amusing and one of the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>A great amount of the storyline felt like filler, as if they were just there to set up the next action scene. This formula works for B-movies and martial arts films, but for a big budget film like DMC, it feels awkward.<br/><br/>The humor is hit-and-miss. It's impossible not to smile Johnny Depp's performance, even at his most outrageous moments. However, it often feels that the writers tried too hard to squeeze in humor at inappropriate places just so they can meet their humor quota. This sort of bad timing is another element that sets DMC below COTBP in terms of quality.<br/><br/>Davy Jones and ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner are two terrific additions to the ""Pirates"" cast. They both add to a very dark atmosphere that the overall story focuses on. While the dark tone is a welcome change for the series, it also makes the story a bit depressing. You can't help but pity Bill Turner, trapped in a world that he can never escape.<br/><br/>Though far-fetched at times, the action/sword-fight scenes are a ton of fun to watch and help make DMC an all-around solid film.<br/><br/>The ending is not 100% satisfying, but that was done intentionally to build up anticipation for the third (and perhaps final) film. I hope that the third film improves on what I didn't like about the story and ties up all the loose ends so it can leave audiences feeling thrilled and satisfied. If they do, The Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy has the potential to be remembered as classics worthy to sit by the legendary Back to the Future and Indiana Jones series as great timeless adventures for everyone to enjoy."

"montezuma_","8","10","18","20 August 2006"," An excellent, if overly dark, adventure film. Expect no more and you WILL enjoy it.
","I enjoyed it. Let's set our expectations sufficiently low here: if you're expecting a piece of cinema that will satisfy you on a critical level, excelling in all the ordinary boxes of plot, character development et cetera, you'll probably be disappointed. The plot is silly and meandering and character development is clichéd (the father thing) and forced.<br/><br/>That's not what this film is about. It's a family adventure film, a swashbuckler. Personally, my criteria for this genre, which I enjoy very much, would be inventive and exciting fight scenes, a little light-hearted comedy and characters that are likable and fun without necessarily having to be compelling or three-dimensional (though it'd help, of course), and spectacular effects, visual feasts and music that capture the imagination.<br/><br/>This film has these in spades. The fights are fantastic and so original it doesn't matter if they're a bit ridiculous. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is in my view as cool as ever while remaining the classic pirate - his last scene in the film (I won't ruin it) stays in the mind for hours after you leave. It's so powerful and awe-inspiring. Once again the environments and scenes, from Tortuga to the islands visited to the ships, are enchanting. The music, though unchanged, remains the brilliantly exciting and dramatic adventure score it always was (I played it in my head during a rugby game while on tour, it's that heart-pounding. I definitely played better. This film will improve your rugby - further incentive.) The issue of violence and darkness is one valid area of concern. There are some nasty bits in this film and some pretty freaky monsters - wait until you see Davey Jones' crew, for one. I'd be careful about bringing your youngest. More than that, however, is the notion that the very imaginative ideas, but very dark ones, that they had in this film might have been better suited in a film that wasn't aimed at families. This would have been better as an adventure thriller with a higher rating. All the ideas are there but they're a bit out of place in a film with Road Runner-esquire cartoon comedy sequences (seriously).<br/><br/>These remain minor issues. This film is not a critically satisfying piece of cinema. But we're not all critics. Expect a funny, passionate and fiercely exciting adventure film and you will be richly rewarded. Promise."
"PizzicatoFishCrouch","5","10","18","18 August 2006"," Sloppy. Sloppy.
","I sat through Pirates of the Caribbean II without any particular expectations, and it was probably better than way, because, had I looked forward to it, I think I would have walked out feeling very, very disappointed. Where the first film was fun, fresh, entertaining and showed flashes of brilliance, the second has been put together with far less consideration to the art of film-making, and with more of an interested eye for the bank statements.<br/><br/>The performances range from acceptable to atrocious. Depp gives his Captain Jack Sparrow the same humour and alcohol-addled craziness that he did with the first. This is both and bad; whilst he is fun to watch and occasionally near-funny, there are hardly any surprises. Pride & Prejudice's Tom Hollander is the shining star of this film, and steals every single scene he's in, a feat made more impressive if you consider that his character is one of the most poorly written of all time. Orlando Bloom is absolutely, horrifyingly, frighteningly awful, and one wonders how good an agent he must have bagged himself to continue getting himself film roles when he's just so bad. And to round off this acting ""ensemble,"" is Keira Knightley, who seems to want the world to forget that she has given an Oscar-nominated performance. It doesn't help that Elizabeth Swann is no Elizabeth Bennet, but Knightley is so utterly frustrating in her constant pouting that one can't help wishing that her character will quickly disappear.<br/><br/>Plot holes are rife and ridiculous. For five whole minutes, I sat there, puzzling over just how did Elizabeth become such a dab hand at swordplay? But the biggest plot hole comes at the end, where you can practically hear Bruckheimer's purse strings anticipating a stretch. Like the rest of the film, the score is below-par, with Hans Zimmer carelessly shoving together the leftovers from his scores to The Da Vinci Code and Gladiator. But the icing on the distasteful cake here is the sloppy, sloppy, screenplay, which made me groan at least 10 times, a record only matched by films such as Crash (2004) and Signs. From the lame jokes as old as the Black Pearl to the clunky, laughable dialogue, there's a rusty jewel of a bad screen writing feat achieved in always every minute of running time. That 4 people were involved in the writing makes the script even more shameful; they were clearly drunk the entire time.<br/><br/>I make it sound as if the film has no saving grace. Admittedly, this is not quite true. Pirates of the Caribbean II: Dead Man's Chest does not set out to be a masterpiece, it aims to be entertainment, and there are the odd moments of surprise and amusement to be found. Some of the undersea scenes invoke the same ghoulishness as felt with the first, and, at times, you can leave you brain at home and attempt to enjoy it. But then I remember the simple thing that is logic, and this film is certainly lacking in it."
"ladygoodman-1","8","10","18","15 August 2006"," Brilliant
","I completely agree about the similarities to Empire. It takes what was great about he first film to more sophisticated places. The music seems more prominent in this one and I've come to love it much more than in the first one. I think the scene where Becket tells Will what he wants from him really marks this as a greater film than the first. It gives an overview of the world the films are set in and adds resonance or something. I can't explain it. It's like the scene in Dirty Dancing when Max talks about how it all seems to be ending - 'You think kids wanna come and take foxtrot lessons with their parents? Trips to Europe! that's what the kids want. 42 countries in 3 days. It just seems like it's all slipping away.' I think scenes like that are what make good films great films if they're pulled off. <br/><br/>Watching pirates 2 was possibly one of the most thrilling viewings I've ever had. It's definitely necessary to have seen the first one. That's what makes the Commodor and what happens with Johnny and Elizabeth more completely brilliant because it's such a turnaround. Gibbs was hilarious too. And I thought Becket was an excellent new character and delivered his lines well."

","I realize most sequels don't compare to the initial blockbuster, but this was a big disappointment in my book for several reasons. The special effects were very good and the acting above average, but the story was weak with a too predictable ending, and especially painful after sitting through the two hour plus flick. So much for Johnny Depps reputation as an independent actor, now officially having sold out for multi millions of $$$, happy meals, Disney toys, etc... Can't say I blame him now that he's supporting a family and paying the bills like the rest of us, but this could have been a much better film if a real investment in character development, the forbidden love story, and Capt Jack's dilemma were made. I'm sure the kids will love it though and happily shell out a weeks worth of allowance to see part 3 next summer."

","The movie begins with Will and Elizabeth's wedding day being interrupted by a power hungry European trading company with the intention and means to hang the happy couple. Will is given the chance for freedom if he can track down Jack Sparrow and return with his faulty compass. Meanwhile, Jack has been notified that time is up and it's time to devote his soul to Davy Jones for a pact made 13 years earlier. Jack realizes that the only chance he has at freedom is to find the chest that holds the heart of Davy Jones and the key that unlocks it. Unfortunately he is not the only one after the heart because who ever controls the heart controls the ocean. This allows for a complex story line where no one is to be trusted and everyone has a different plan for the heart once it is found.<br/><br/>The special effects were great in this and the action scenes were over the top but it seemed that the dialogue wasn't nearly as witty or snappy as in the original. That's not to say that there wasn't any funny dialog, it just seemed that the focus was more on physical humor when a laugh was needed. There are a couple of twists (that I won't spill) and an ending that leads right into the third installment (which is currently filming and due to be released next summer). The one thing I must praise about this is the addressing of a complaint I had about the first film. In the first film it was mentioned that Will's father had been strapped to a cannon and tossed overboard. Since they had all been cursed and couldn't die then that meant he was still alive throughout the first film but would've drowned when the curse was broken. He is in this film and clears up my previous grievance that I had (don't worry, this is revealed in the first five minutes of the movie). This is definitely worth paying $7 to see in the theater, but if you're wanting to get the most out of your money I still think Superman Returns is the better choice right now.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit me at http://360.yahoo.com/movie_maniac79"

This movie could have been cut down by at least one hour, I think Disney studios are the real pirates here. They borrowed too many ideas from other movies like 20000 leagues under the sea. The cannibals have also been used too may times in other movies. Girl dressed as a man and nobody notice it , been done before. All the important characters survive every disaster and those that don't survive come back again. Weird looking characters on the Flying Dutchman, the only character missing was Spongebob.

There were some moments where I felt slightly out of the loop, but I loved it! Gore Verbinski manages to create a world so real that outsiders like us feel like, well outsiders. It's fantastic to lose oneself completely in this absolute creation instead of sitting through another dumbed downed version re-written in modern American- speak so the lamest of the audience can comprehend. <br/><br/>If you let yourself be lost in this film, in the world, the characters, and just go for the ride, it's a good one. I really want to see the flick again just so I can catch the little things in language I missed the first time. I think the people who complain about this movie for being too complicated are just not ready for intelligent films. Go see some pretty, but stupid, film like Superman. Leave the real stories for the rest of us. <br/><br/>And speaking of pretty.. wow, what fantastic shots and scenes and fight sequences!

I just wanted to find out more.<br/><br/>Now, I knew going in that this was the middle film in a trilogy, so I didn't mind that it opened a lot of doors and had no resolutions. That's what the middle does. The beginning sets up, the middle builds, and the end ties it up. Next year, we can get the finale and I am so looking forward to it!<br/><br/>Also, partly because I ran into the cast while they were filming at Universal, and noticed Georffrey Rush in the mix, I knew that Barbossa was in there somewhere, so the end didn't bother me at all, but intrigue me enough that I'll be at the midnight for Pirates 3, no doubt!<br/><br/>Enjoy this film and the fullness of true storytelling. Stories have taken a backseat lately to big budget special effects, so here's the rare opportunity to have both. And don't worry.. it'll all make sense when number 3 opens next year.<br/><br/>And kudos to both Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley for moving their characters forward. Both felt different.. more matured, more complicated. Obviously their characters had been changed since the last adventure and it showed, but both kept the basic core of the character and built on it. Brilliant work. As for Johnny Depp, it was fantastic to see him as a true Pirate.. in the first film, he was a castaway on a mission. Now, he's in his element and yes, remember.. he's still a Pirate. They weren't known as the good guys. Sparrow has his moments where he shows how one can be a Pirate, and a good man. <br/><br/>Good work to all. I could care less about you nay-sayers. I'll see it enough times in the theatre to make up for you."
"coolmovieguy","6","12","23","7 July 2006"," An OK film....obviously rushed
","I love the Pirate movies....don't get me wrong. They are a lot of fun. However, I thought the second film was rushed and over-used many of the special effects. I do not want to give anything away but you will see what I mean while viewing the film. The cast was pitch perfect. Depp just keeps getting better and better. <br/><br/>The length of the film was a major issue. I thought it was a bit too long and the word of mouth on the length will not work for the better for this film. I think I had high expectations for this film because the first one blew me away. Not because it was a good movie but because it was unlike anything I have ever seen. I was hoping to be blown away by this one but I just felt some parts were too dull and when the scenes were exciting they did not last long. A 6 is pushing it. I thought it could have been so much better if the production was not rushed. I can see it had to make a deadline but something this huge should be filmed carefully and to perfection. I think Disney really wanted to make this movie a ""filler"" to fill in the gap between (hopefully) the two stronger movies. <br/><br/>The one thing I can say I loved about the film was the end, it was very satisfying and leaves me wanting more of the Pirate world."

","Where the first installment instantly gripped us with a brief hint of a ghost-story followed by the single best introduction of a character ever shown on film, this mess begins with a series of hacked together scenes with almost not a single laugh (or even action sequence) to be seen.<br/><br/>This trend continues for some time - the beloved Captain Jack Sparrow is not up to his usual self. It's hard to decide what was messier - the dialogue (which gets only marginally better throughout the film) or the action sequences, which only had a handful of 'Cool' or 'Surprising' moments.<br/><br/>Where before, we had witty dialogue punctuated by clichéd but well-choreographed action sequences, we're now left with a few reasonable lines, one or sight gags (of many) that actually worked, and perhaps one or two memorable action sequences.<br/><br/>Also missing here is a villain we might be interested in. We were engaged when watching Geoffrey Rush as the powerful, unhappy and driven Barbossa... but poor Bill Nighy has nothing to go on here, so I don't think even a better performance would really have helped.<br/><br/>If someone had taken the few good concepts and images from this script and beaten it about a bit more, this might have been less of a snoozer.<br/><br/>There's no magic here.<br/><br/>My rating: 2/5 stars - vaguely entertaining."

Walking out, I realized all the money was spent on special effects and not enough on the actual screenplay.

Don't get me wrong this isn't brain surgery by no means but give me a plot that I can follow. The filmmakers tried to get everyone from the previous film--screen time and a subplot. I gave up on the last hour trying to figure out who was the good guys and bad guys. Yes the special effects was great but that does not make a good movie.

Jack Sparrow emerging from a coffin tossed into the ocean was reminiscent of a scene from ""The Man In the Iron Mask""; the native islanders (cannibals) blending into the scenery (can't see them until they open their eyes) was lifted from the first Predator movie.<br/><br/>The movie's only saving grace was the re-introduction of Capt.

I can't believe that Disney was willing to sell out those great characters from the first Pirate for the sake of pounding the audience with tedious, excessive and overblown special effects. The plot, which was actually quite good, was totally over-shadowed by this ridiculous display. A full half-hour of beast tentacles activity could have easily been cut, and would have been a major improvement. Some scenes were so slimy and gross that I wanted a shower the second I got out of the theater.

","I love action movies, even if they're stupid, but I really can't say enough bad things about Pirates of the Caribbean Part 2.<br/><br/>Let's start with the complete lack of chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. Or Bloom's character and his father. Or Keira's character and her father. Or everyone and Jack Sparrow. Sparrow staggers around the film like he's drunk or just deranged. It's supposed to be cute but it makes him an anti-hero and it just didn't work for me.<br/><br/>The special effects are totally misused. They could have looked creepy and made me frightened. But the undersea Davey Jones monsters look comical instead, and not in a good way, rather in a way that pulled me out of the movie so I could not really engage with it.<br/><br/>To add to that, the plot lines don't make any sense. People are always pledging loyalty and servitude to each other, running around after various artifacts, and so forth. At one point, without spoiling the plot, there's a dice game involving pledges and oaths that made no sense to me whatsoever. It was so complicated and there's such a large cast of characters I really couldn't figure anything out. Everyone's fighting everyone else too, and it's like they can't decide whether to fight or be friends or fight again. The implausible character decisions combined with all the superstitious muckety-muck reminds me very much of the film The Mummy. ""Let's get the golden chalice into the water of doom before the clock ticks midnight because the silver bat of Davey Jones needs to feed on the insects of horror"". OK, whatever, people.<br/><br/>Finally, instead of ending the film with some kind of closure, it turns out the entire movie is just a setup for the next film. I wanted to leave half-way through but my date kept me there, hoping the film would get better. Unfortunately, it doesn't get any better. If you go and you don't like the first 10 minutes, just leave. Or better yet, stay away.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Nobody, except maybe kids because they're too naive to know junk when they see it<br/><br/>-- Anyone who enjoyed Independence Day and The Mummy, you're good people just entirely lacking in taste I'll give this film a 4 out of 10, and it would have been lower except I did enjoy a small fraction of the humor and action."

Let me list them: No Decent Plot, No worthwhile villain (unless you count Norington), Stupid Effects, Creature features and Teenager gross-outs. And not to mention no decent romance.

","After hearing the initial Luke warm reviews, and not so hot word of mouth I was surprised to see ""Dead Man's Chest"" doing so well on IMDb. After seeing the movie myself, I am still confused.<br/><br/>This movie lacked any of the originality and fun that the first one possessed. While the first movie was a pleasant surprise, this was a disappointment. All the jokes were merely references to the original. It was funny the first time, but if I wanted to laugh at rum jokes, I would have rented the first one. I wanted something new and dynamic; instead I got re-runs and a convoluted plot that made no sense.<br/><br/>This movie has some upside, it looked great, there was a lot of action, and the acting was pretty good. However it suffered from an unoriginal script, and absurd and confusing plot, and massive, unexplained changes in certain characters. Not to mention it was much too long and nothing really happened. I can only hope that the sequel to Dead Man's Chest is the better half of this two-act play.<br/><br/>I don't understand how everyone can be praising this movie other than blind love of Captain Jack. This movie brought almost nothing to the table and left me bored. It is visually stunning, and the actors are good, but there is too much flash and not enough substance.<br/><br/>5 out of 10, you will see it, but you won't be happy you did."

I'm quite exited that there will be a third movie in the series - and pretty much can't wait to see it.<br/><br/>While I won't say this is as good as Empire, it's still a very good follow-up to a really fun movie.

","Let's get a couple of things straight--I loved the first Pirates film. It was a deliciously fun swashbuckling adventure that had its tongue firmly planted in its cheek. Director Gore Verbinski sailed his cast into a sunny experience that just made you smile out of pure enjoyment.<br/><br/>But, in the world of the Caribbean, it's amazing how quickly the weather can turn against you. To put it bluntly, Dead Man's Chest is downright boring. It's poorly paced. It lacks a cohesive structure. And, for an action movie, it lacks great action sequences. The story, which is a convoluted mess that reeks of multiple screenwriters with too many ideas and not enough common sense, takes a good two hours to get interesting. Yup, I said it. TWO HOURS. In the meantime, we're tossed back and forth from character to character with vague dialogue and leaky pirate ships until the whole shindig smells as bad as the Kraken's breath.<br/><br/>When we do finally reach the bombastic action-packed finale, it's hard to care anymore. Like an unruly dinner party guest, Pirates 2 long outstays its welcome. Character motivations weren't explained. Plot is thick and unintelligible. And, as a result, ""Dead Man's Chest"" becomes a victim of trying to do a little bit of everything, but at the same time, not doing anything particularly well. Sure, the special effects looked top notch, but in a world where computer generated wizardry is the norm, it takes a lot more than a fish people to get one to turn his head in wonder.<br/><br/>It's fascinating how all the best cinematic ingredients (a good director, solid cast, brilliant special effects) all come together to taste downright bitter without the unifying power of a solid story. And, as the famous theme park attraction prophetically declares, ""They're be rough waters ahead."" In the meantime, I raise a glass of grog to the heavens in hope that the third installment brings life back to such a promising franchise."

","After the first film, I was more than excited to see Dead Man's Chest. First, let me start with the positives: the special effects were great and Johnny Depp portrayed (once again) a clever Jack Sparrow. That's about all. The story was what really disappointed me. At 2 and 1/2 hours, I was checking my watch and counting down the seconds until it was over. The plot was full of useless plot devices and pointless, mindless scenes which only served to make the movie longer. It seems that other reviews on this site ""have many unanswered questions"" about the movie. The reason a lot of questions go unanswered is because the movie never takes a clear stance on any direction it wants to go in and chooses to leave the audience (myself included) slightly confused. The plot seems to go in circles and nothing is ever really resolved or understood. I know many would say that I should just wait for the next sequel to answer my questions, but shouldn't a movie at least be able to stand on its own without one? Perhaps sequels 2 and 3 should have been made into one movie...oh wait that would have just made it more unbearably long and pointless. In the end, Geoffrey Rush's portrayal of Barbossa seems to be only redeeming factor and hope for another movie that will be as good as the first. Not Recommended."

After being nagged constantly by my friends, I gave in. And now I can safely say it's one of the best movies of the year-in my opinion anyway.<br/><br/>The plot-with the least amount of spoilers possible-was basically Jack has a debt to pay to Davey Jones, so he goes to find the Dead Mans Chest which has Davey Jones' heart inside. But DJ sends the Kraken out after him...and that's as far as I'll go for now. It was an original situation, nothing like the first movie-well, maybe some things were similar, but mostly fresh and original.<br/><br/>The acting was brilliant. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow was obviously the star of the show, although both Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's acting seemed forced or something. Elizabeth seemed more annoying in this movie.

Why do they keep making making 2hr movies that last nearly 3 hours, this basically shows that no matter how much money you spend on making a movie, you must get the storyline right.

","Back in the days, I didn't understand all the ruckus about the first 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie. Sure, not a bad one, but not exactly ground-breaking and amazing. I believed that one was an average action-adventure movie featuring great actors given much screen-time to show themselves off on.<br/><br/>So comes the news of not one, but TWO sequels being made at the same time! Hmm... have we seen that before? *Giggles* I had my doubts about a sequel. What plot could it possibly contain that would be a continuation of the first? Needless to say, it doesn't have one. Here we have the about-to-get-married young, handsome couple being torn apart, having to call in favours. We have the western sacrificial maid (however portrayed in Depp's character) which screams King Kong all over it with 'black natives' and all. We have fish-like, undead pirates serving on a ship that can dive (!) and under a captain who has sealed his heart away in a coffin where it keeps beating because... Well, it doesn't make any sense at all to me and certainly not to the first film.<br/><br/>The character development is nowhere to be seen. The returned cast keeps doing just what they did in the first film and being just the same people. The now introduced characters are too predictable stereotypes - especially the island witch who of course is black and speaks with a heavy caribbean/haitan accent. Well well... it's a shame the storyline didn't go down with the captain and the monster in the end.<br/><br/>If you want to see 2Â½ hours with cunning stunts, visual attractions and quite disgusting situations, PotC: Dead man's chest is for you.

","Darker than the first film, and even more episodic, is PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN with Johnny Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. He holds the spotlight most of the time even though he is up against some of the most fantastic looking creatures a make-up man ever devised. Hideous as they are, it's hard to look away when they come on the screen. The cinematography is stunning, but the fast clip of scenes is overdone and gets wearying after awhile.<br/><br/>ORLANDO BLOOM and KEIRA KNIGHTLEY do nicely as hero and heroine, the sort of pair that harks back to the days of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland. Miss Knightley has a beautiful face but not quite the warmth of personality this sort of heroine should have. Orlando Bloom looks good with a sword but needs more work with his acting abilities.<br/><br/>The busy, overly orchestrated score by Hans Zimmer pounds away at the music in what must be the most overwritten score of the year. Dialog manages to be clear enough except for Naomi Harris who mumbles some inexplicable heavily accented words as the exotic Tia Dalma that should have required sub-titles for all their blurriness.<br/><br/>Most fun are the chase scenes wherein Bloom and others are locked inside some sort of a rolling wheel-barrel--but all of the special effects are handsomely staged for maximum effect. And surely, an army of stuntmen must have been kept busy on the sound stages for all of the action scenes.<br/><br/>Depp's character is given some questionable things to do. His moral compass is not quite what it ought to be, even if he is the anti-hero of this swashbuckling epic. And much of the action scenes could have been trimmed to bring the story in at a length less than two-and-a-half hours. Perhaps with some of the action trimmed, there would have been time for more emphasis on exposition, especially for those who never saw the first film.<br/><br/>Aside from these minor reservations, it's highly enjoyable entertainment for those wanting to escape the summer heat and looking for more than two hours of pirate fantasy with stunning special effects and photography."

Sparrow is the reason to see the movie but there is so much more. The movie's last hour is simply awesome and the way its creators prepared us for the third film is very clever. I am happy that one of my favorite characters from the first movie made the appearance and will be the part of this trilogy (?) final(?) chapter. The film is exiting, has stunning special effects and I am sure that the make up artists will be nominated for all possible awards in the end of the year (they deserve them all). I will not mention the plot - it is there but it's not that important after all.

","I really liked the first Pirates movie. And I think Johnny Depp was actually fantastic in both. I don't find Bloom's acting interesting, he is even a bit wooden. At any rate, this movie was disappointing in most every aspect. The high points, which there were but few, came too infrequently. Whereas the first movie pulled you in and kept you in rapt attention, I found myself drifting, constantly checking my watch. I suppose my two biggest gripes with this movie is that it was too long. The script and material could not handle 2+ hours of movie. It seemed to plod on endlessly. The second problem is they weren't up front about the fact that this movie is simply a setup for the 3rd movie. If I have to sit through that long a movie and not get a resolution at the end - I want to know beforehand. What is worse, this did not make me wish to see the third one, at all. In fact, I may want to see the third one less now. Jack Sparrow is still a fantastic character, but I fear the Pirates are heading down the same path as the Matrix...expectations need to be readjusted. This will not be a classic Trilogy."

","I cannot understand why people like this kind of movie. There is nothing good about this movie and the story is completely stupid. Strange thing, I like the first one (7/10). How I can write 10 lines of comments about this movie. This is the minimum requirement to post a review. Again it's a waist of time. But if it can help you to save your precious time and money, I will write it. The effects are not too bad and the actors too. The problem is that there is no story at all! Like I said previously, this is a bad movie with nothing funny. replace the actors with some no names and it will fall down in the negative rating. The movie is just a big patch between number one and number three that is suppose to be good."

","An action movie has to be pretty bad if within 40 minutes you fall asleep. Therefore I cannot give a fair comment on the film. However, I found nothing to keep me awake. I could care less about the characters or the plot premise, they had no substance. This action movie had no action at all. Which is great if you need something to zone out to while you are in bed trying to catch up on some sleep. Actually I was hoping for something entertaining and with a good fight scene here and there. For the next Pirates movie they should choose a new director and hire writers.The only good thing was the special effects but that magic only lasts 10 minutes tops. Because without a nice story and characters you can connect with, the special effects do not mean much"

","I am a huge fan of Pirates of the Caribbean, and not only for the male actors.<br/><br/>The first film had a lot of substance and it gave something new to the current movie world. But when I went to see this sequel, I was horrified.<br/><br/>The jokes were the same as they were in the first film, with Jack Sparrow saying, ""Whys the rum always gone?"", and a woman from Tortuga slapped Will on the face, as the woman did to Jack in the first film.<br/><br/>It was only funny at parts as it reminded us of the first film.<br/><br/>The only thing that I loved about the film was the graphics. They were amazing. Davey Jones's tentacles especially. Some of the pirates on Davey Jones's ship looked a tad 'cartoony' and out of place, but other than that, the graphics really stood out.<br/><br/>Getting on to the soundtrack, something which the first film was well known for. Well in this film, guess what? It was the same. Some pieces had slightly differences in the melodies but otherwise, it was the same at the first.<br/><br/>I hope that the third instalment will be better, but I have a feeling that it wont."

Half way through I wanted to leave, by the time it got to the 'fight on the wheel' I was shuffling in my seat and checking my watch every 5 minutes and by the end I was relieved to be able to leave at last.<br/><br/>Not only was this film over an hour too long, it was just boring. Too many set pieces, too little decent dialogue, WAY too much pouting from Ms Knightly and even Johnny failed to deliver.<br/><br/>And do you know what REALLY annoyed me? SPOILER ALERT ... after Jack sent Will to the Flying Dutchman, and Will escaped with the key. He was picked up by a boat. Now, earlier in the film we had spent time with these characters on this boat. We had invested in them. They weren't bad people; they weren't evil. They didn't even seem relevant to move the plot along but we, as an audience, had invested something in them. Then, Will gets rescued by them, and they all die at the tentacles of the Kraken. Does Will experience any remorse? HARDLY. It just seemed completely out of the blue and pointless. Why introduce us to this ship previously if it has no purpose in the plot.

","It's a shame that yet another great movie (Curse of the Black Pearl) is used as the basis of such mediocre cinema. Painfully lacking in key elements, such as visible acting skills and a strong plot, Dead Man's Chest is a very ordinary follow-up to a great movie. <br/><br/>Certainly audiences flocking to see the comical swagger of Johnny Depp and the handsome face of Orlando Bloom won't leave disappointed, despite Orlando's wooden acting. However I am in doubt that a lot of movie goers will be enthralled by the slapstick, somewhat juvenile attempts at humor the film produces. The action in this movie is thoroughly overused, and becomes quite boring towards the end. Indeed, I was sitting in my chair in the theater growing increasingly tedious at the endless roaring action scenes, and honestly couldn't wait to see the back of this movie.<br/><br/>If you completely base a movie on how good the CGI is, then this movie is for you.

","I'm afraid to say I was very disappointed with this film. I had high expectations from the start, having been such a huge fan of POTC1, but I found myself looking at my watch wanting it to end! The characters had very little depth or substance to them this time, even Jack Sparrow was paralytic - over the top. The special effects became the main 'character' of the film and everything else revolved around them. 'Curse of the Black Pearl' was brilliant in every way and so much fun that I never notice the hours going by. 'Dead Man's Chest' was an effort to sit through and I doubt very much I'll bother going to see the third installment because frankly, I don't care what happens next!

This movie made me want to leave the theater & it put my husband sleep. It's not that the film was without action, but it was written without making sense. The characters would not have gone to the lengths they went to, for the reasons they did (to be vague) and if you do pay to see this movie (I wouldn't recommend it) brace yourself for a very confusing and unsatisfying ""tieing up of loose ends"" - I thought there was way too much of Davy Jones and CGI scenes.

Once you've seen a couple of stupid sea-men you don't need to keep seeing them over and over. The physical adventures of the characters, the sword-fights, etc would have been exciting enough without the stupid creatures added on. And the blatant set-up for a sequel is a box-office cheat.

","Yet another sequel! Capn' Jack returns for another adventure, and this time the scale is ginormous! If you thought Pirates 1 was action packed, and spectacular, this film goes far beyond with massive sets, brilliant effects, and a massive 2 and a half hour running time, that will have you leaving the theatre feeling like you've spent a year in the harshest prison, wearing a ballerina's outfit, with a bull's-eye painted on your rear. Now the scale is huge, and there's all the lavish extravagance that Bruckheimer loves to give his punters, but the story lacks some cohesion, and it's all a bit too much, without much in the way of character depth. That could be an unfair nitpicking for a film entitled Pirates of the Caribbean sure, but the film is little more than a rollicking and fun night out at the cinema. It's not going to adorn top 100 lists of film buffs around the world that's for sure.<br/><br/>However this is the second in a series of films that should be predominantly about fun, spectacle, and pure entertainment. In this regard Pirates 2 more than delivers, while maybe lacking the ingenuity and surprise factor of the first movie which, mainly thanks to Johnny Depp, took the public by storm. Depp once again is superb, despite giving one of his least interesting performances, as of course this is the first time ever, he's reprised a role, and Depp of course is renowned for doing startlingly different roles from one film to the next. It actually seems incredibly strange to see Depp treading old ground, still his creation of Jack Sparrow is superb. Orlando Bloom again is in the film for little more than to play the straight man to Depp, and to look good for the ladies. It's not a great role for Bloom, who as yet hasn't proved just whether he's going to be a top actor or not, or merely a pretty boy. To some extent the same is true of Keira Knightly, who come mud, sweat, grime, or rain, or dragged up as a boy, looks phenomenal. However while this role offers little for Keira she has already proved she's going to be a great actress (one Oscar nod to her name already!). On one regard though Bloom and Knightley at least have more to do in this film, and Depp is allowed to step back every now and again. This isn't merely the Depp show, which is arguably to the films detriment. The rest of the cast are good, but it's Bill Nighy who steals the show managing to convey an amazingly expressive performance from behind his squiddy CGI mask.<br/><br/>All in all Pirates 2 delivers all you could want in a fantasy adventure. The story gets muddle in amongst all the swordfights and giant sea creatures, but still for pure fun at the movies, you can't go far with this. I most certainly look forward to Pirates 3. ***1/2"

","Smart movies always have a seed. If you want to read them, it always pays to start from that seed.<br/><br/>Disney has been very smart about those seeds in the past, and they may be entering a new age of power in this regard, now that at least one of their research ideas has born fruit.<br/><br/>The seed in this case comes from the business reality that Disney has a special way to leverage movie franchises through their themeparks. The question is: what cinematic effects can you put into a movie that will stick in the popular imagination AND be exploitable in a completely different domain, the one of physically built rides, what they call ""attractions."" There are colorful characters of course. But what else? Worlds, but how to define worlds. What works? Viewers might not be aware of the rather exotic science that comes into play, in addition to following trusted artists with intuition.<br/><br/>""Treasure Planet"" was an experiment in how to place a camera so that the environment was the star, more precisely the built environment, the ship and planet. And in that case, the edges. The world is made of edges  in our eye and mind. It wasn't a particularly effective movie, either as entertainment or architectural experiment.<br/><br/>But there were lessons learned from it. Most of what we know in film and architecture goes back to Orson Welles, in particular his ""Othello."" The first one in this franchise was very serious about this, a heavy investment. Sure, they wanted to sell theater tickets. But more than that they wanted to built monetizable intellectual property, duly injected into the culture.<br/><br/>With that as preface, look at how the camera relates to the built spaces here. Its extraordinary, extreme. Every shot starts with the inclusion of an edge, which is then registered with an object: a ship usually, but any space. The reason is because they will later be selling entry into that space.<br/><br/>See how every composition is thus influenced. You can see it immediately from the opening: rain on lips of teacups... what a device! Then scanning  not panning  to tell you that what you will get is place defined first. The situation is always placed.<br/><br/>Later, the big effect is a huge wheel. You can just see the brainstorm: we need something that is spatial, that moves, that moves differently than anything else in life or the movie. We have to be inside it and outside. We have to as characters be manipulated by it, its dynamics not influenced by humans.<br/><br/>Then see how that is set up earlier by the similar device, men in suspended globes (of bones!).<br/><br/>Its a remarkable advance in the cinematic lexicon.

","Let me start out saying that the first ""Pirates"" was one of the better movies made in the last decade. ""Dead Man's Chest"" (DMC) is unfortunately just like any other Disney sequel (the first being funny and endearing while the second unexciting and far from lovable- with the exception of ""Toy Story 2""). DMC is full of over-used clichés as well as not-so-great dialog. The actors aren't bad but they were put into bad roles this time around. The only way the story moved was because of all of the debts the characters had to fulfill. Also there was no one really to root for- everyone back stabs someone else at least once. The plot is best described as ""The Family Circus"" boy who wanders around all over the comic strip following no real line. The whole beginning of the movie (probably 30 minutes or so) was completely unnecessary (no plot advancement) and the scene of killing the doomed crew is nothing like any swash-buckler I've ever seen. Also the fun humor from the first movie is lost as DMC tries unsuccessfully to use even the same jokes. The few things going good for the movie is the two additions to the story (Davy Jones and Bootstrap Bill) and the decent graphics."

The first movie had its own plot and ending. The last two have one plot and the second definitely did not have an ending. It should either be all three with a continuous plot or 3 individual plots. <br/><br/>Next problem I have is minor in comparison, but annoying none the less: THE EASTER EGG WAS AWFUL.

Instead, you are kept waiting for the scene to be over, only to have another essentially identical scene follow. The humorous plot of the original has been scrapped for a darker, stranger, and creepier one. Also, it seems like the creators of the film wanted to make so many twists that they ruined the story.<br/><br/>Actually, the movie starts out fine, with the same quirkiness and fun that made the first film so great. But the movie absolutely stalls in the middle. The action in this part doesn't move the story along at all. Although there are some interesting and shocking twists at the very end, it doesn't salvage the movie. Nor does the still-wonderful acting of Jonhny Depp help the movie too much. The film's ending doesn't end the story, and it becomes obvious that the sequel will deal with the same tedious plot.<br/><br/>Another complaint I have is that the new film has abandoned any sense of realism in the original film and created what is essentially a fantasy film, complete with sea monsters and beating hearts in chests. (Guess where the title came from)!<br/><br/>---POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW--- Many of the characters that were created in the first film have been ruined, with Norrington making an appearance as a drunken, greedy bad guy, after losing his power and dignity because of a powerful trading company, which also detracts from the story. A strange love triangle also develops among Sparrow, Elizabeth, and Will. Jack's whole personality seems to change a bit in the end too.<br/><br/>We meet Will Turner's father, in one of the more interesting parts of the film, although he's not exactly the way you'd imagine him.<br/><br/>Also, there is an important character from the old film, who you would never expect to return, that makes a surprise appearance at the end.

"ZekeRage911","5","3","4","25 January 2007"," What was this movie about?
","Okay, I know I'm gonna get flamed for this, but I have to speak.<br/><br/>I'm a writer, and when you're a writer long enough, you can kind of develop a sense of what the writer is thinking when he writes a scene in a movie, just by watching that scene. This movie was so all over the map I think it fell off the edge of the world.<br/><br/>Let's begin with the plot(s). It reminded me of that God awful Lost in Space movie that had five writers, four plots, and none of them particularly compelling. Or like Disney's Atlantis that also had multiple stories, and only resolved about 2 of them. And not even sensibly. Now I know this is them middle movie in a trilogy, but even so, watching it made me feel impatient, irritated, and worst of all, unimpressed.<br/><br/>For one thing, the director is an idiot. Where there was exposition, there should have been story. Where there was action, there should have been exposition, and where there was story, there should have been something to tie all three together. This movie, from what I get from my ""writer's sense"" if you want to call it, was written to be complex and compelling. However, we must remember who the executive producer is. Jerry Bruckheimer, the king of action. I seriously doubt there was a scene in the script where three people sword fight in a rolling mill wheel. More than a few times, I called out in the theater ""All right, this is ri-goddamn-diculous."" It came off as cartoony instead of exciting and comical instead of dramatic. Sometimes that works, like with Hudson Hawk, sometimes it doesn't, like right here.<br/><br/>What carries this movie through is the acting. Depp is fantastic (again) and his supporting cast makes almost everything perfectly believable and compelling. But they just can't make up for the way this movie was Bruckheimerized. I sincerely hope the next movie can stay on the rails the way the first movie did, and not become a train wreck of action and cartoony fight scenes.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this movie is, as I said, direction. Namely, there wasn't any. And I'm sorry, but I've never found squid-monsters to be all that terrifying or impressive. The undead crew of the first movie was fantastic! It may not have been original, but between the excellent acting, the decent story, the good directing and solid writing, it's become one of the great movies that will surely be a classic. However everything the first movie did right (except for the acting) got dumped into the ocean with a cannon tied to its bootstraps in the second.<br/><br/>More than anything else, I got tired of the constant off-camera treachery that revealed itself (predictably) two scenes later. The very last scene of the movie, where Norrington drops off the heart of Davy Jones on the bad guys desk, made me so angry I almost shouted out again. Because the end of the movie had NO resolution. The Black Pearl sank, Captain Jack was ""killed,"" the bad guy got the heart, no one defeated Davy Jones or his Kraken, and then as if things weren't convoluted enough, suddenly Barbosa's back.<br/><br/>This ensures that the third movie will begin with more loose ends than the second, and the second had to cut at it's own ropes to create those loose ends in the first place.<br/><br/>Now, onto the things I liked about this movie. Despite the cartoonishness, it had its dark moments. The very beginning with the bodies in cages being eaten by birds, the snapping in half of bodies by the Kraken, the cage of bones made out of the former crew of the Black Pearl, all excellent touches that really brought out a sense of danger and fear. Unfortunately, the squid monsters just weren't nearly that scary. If they had been, things might have been different (and better.) As I said, the acting is excellent, and all the characters are both believable, and true to their natures. With the exception of the two morons who were comic relief in the last movie. Their sudden acceptance as ""good guys"" irritated me (that lack of exposition again.) The visual effects were brilliant. Even with the heavy reliance on CGI, the movie's effects were seamless, which given the budget, they ought to be.<br/><br/>And I will admit, despite it's various flaws, the movie was fun. Unfortunately, the length slowly drained me of my enthusiasm (like the ending of Return of the King, and the eighteen endings that came after it.) But otherwise, it was entertaining, and generally acceptable by current Hollywood standards. Still, it was a FAR cry from the first movie.<br/><br/>Overall, while I enjoyed most of it, the total lack of direction and coherent storytelling made this movie fall ultimately flat. It's a case of trying too hard to make something good into something great that actually leaves it mediocre and wanting. If you're a fan of the franchise, by all means see it, but don't go in with high expectations."
"gusand","3","3","4","12 January 2007"," Total let down
","Let me first say that I did really enjoy the first film. Its a great matinée adventure and Johnny Depps performance is (as always) awesome.<br/><br/>Given the success of its predecessor, a sequel was probably a safe bet. But this is really one of the lamest excuses for a sequel I've seen in quite a while. It really feels as if the production crew tried to put as little effort into it as possible. The uninspiring story feels like something a teenager could put together in 20 minutes, the jokes aren't half as good in the first film, dumbed down and childish. The whole movie feels as if it has been ""disneyfied"" compared to the first film, and I do mean that in a bad way.<br/><br/>And I still haven't mentioned the fact that it is painfully overlong clocking in at 2 hours and 30 minutes. Maybe if the director could be persuaded into editing this and the next film into something less that 2 hours we might have something that is at least watchable. As it stands now, I certainly wont wast my time on the last film."
"deckid","4","3","4","10 January 2007"," Not as good as the first
","Well...I was sorely disappointed with the sequel. The movie opened fast paced, but it left me feeling like the story was garbled. The flow of the entire movie was hard to keep up with. I think Disney went over the top with this production trying to capture too many details. I have to say that even my teenagers thought the story line was reaching a bit. Davy Jones is suppose to be a pirate not some sort of weird sea creature/pirate. Elizabeth was best played as the nearly helpless, but clever lady in the first Pirates movie than in the sequel where her behavior wasn't at all believable. The humor and the action scenes were lacking over all. It's really difficult to make a good sequel, but hopefully, Disney will get it right in the 3rd."
"bmaria_cr","Null","3","4","18 December 2006"," Dreadful
","I was really excited to see this movie, as I enjoyed the first immensely. After 20 minutes, I was ready to shut off my DVD. The level of violence and gross-out factor have been raised as if to compensate for the lack of plot. I can't believe this is rated a PG. Character-building and plot were non-existent. The scene on the cannibal island was unnecessary and worthless. It contributed nothing to the plot. The windmill scene was overdone and ridiculous. Where was the plot? That's my main beef with the movie. And how can you have a movie without a plot? Well, Hollywood does it quite well everyday, but I was hoping that this would be different, as the first movie had been. Overall it was just dreadful. Another desperate attempt to capitalize on a movie that had originality and subplots. Disney, stop while you're ahead!"

","Let me preface my review by saying this: I was a huge fan of POTC:COTBP. I watched it a countless number of times, I knew all the lines, I loved every nuance - pretty much, I was a POTC nerd. That being said, I was sorely disappointed with this movie. Maybe it was because I loved the first movie so much and I had such high expectations (that deep down I knew wouldn't be met) that I didn't like the sequel. Everything I was hoping they wouldn't do... they did: they recycled every joke from the first movie and I think there were a total of 4 new ones... that's terrible. Captain Jack Sparrow acted so differently from the first movie as well - whereas he used to be a conniving pirate, now he was just clumsy and cowardly without that edge he used to have. Elizabeth and Will were both annoying, and the only character I was happy to see was Norrington because I was rather amused by his whole drunken rampage. This movie was pretty much made as a way to market on the success of the first movie - and if that was their intention, they certainly succeeded - this movie was box office gold. But in terms of really making an incredible movie that could stand on its own - well, then they failed. There were a lot of unnecessarily long sequences (and believe me, I didn't think the first movie was too long even though a lot of people thought it should have been shortened by an hour). It also reneged on the whole idea of Bootstrap Bill being dead, mostly because the audience was interested in his character. That was another cop-out. The bottom line is, if you don't have any fresh material, don't make a new movie. Period."
"A_Square","2","3","4","6 December 2006"," Piece of Tripe
","I believe my friend gave the best review of this movie. One third Island of Doctor Moreau. 1/3 thousand leagues under the sea and 1/3 pirates. This has turned the barely fun character of Sparrow into a idiotic character that flops around the Caribbean. Not only is the Bloom character a laughing stock but the whole idea that he plays Yahtzee TM for his, not to mention others souls is ridiculous. The Knight character has become a hypocritical feminist by the yelling at the men of the film for fighting then grabbing for her cutlass the instant danger reared its ugly head. The ending itself is the worst for the Sparrow character cheats everyone in the film but for some unknown reason the crew decide to go for his soul. For the love of the almighty I hope the next movie is better written and not an excuse for special effects."

","I waited for this one to come out on the cheap screen, and I wish I had waited another few months for video. If you have little concern for any film-making aspects beyond special effects and action, you'll love this movie. If you care at all about any sense of continuity, plot sequencing, character development, and dialogue, you're going to be grinding your teeth through this movie, essentially a series of 20 minute action scenes strung together by an unnecessarily confusing plot. (and don't tell me that plot, characters etc don't matter in a good action/adventure flick; the first movie had plenty of action, but was an excellent story with good writing). I think the biggest problem was the editing. It seems that to please the audience base, the director chose to keep in all of the action, creating for a very long 2 and 1/2 hours; to keep it from being even longer, key scenes that helped develop the plot/characters were clearly cut.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I went and saw ""The Illusionist"" after. 2 different genres of course, but the difference between a quality, entertaining, and well-crafted film and a hyped blockbuster couldn't have been any more glaring.<br/><br/>p.s. a pretty dark and violent movie in places, if you're planning on bringing your kids..."

","I can see how some teenagers or even younger people can like ""Dead Man's Chest"", it has some really cool effects going on and the story is easy to follow. On several occasions i had to remind myself that i wasn't in fact watching a new Star Wars movie with loads of funky looking aliens, and that's not a good thing in a movie about pirates, IMHO. Cool effects and costumes perhaps, but too little effort has been put into making the story or the characters that interesting. It's like Star Wars and Indiana Jones but without a hint of soul. I would have been more forgiving if it was 1.30h long, 2.5h is just too much for the little material they really have. This is a typical ""high budget but zero interest in originality or story""-Hollywood movie. It left me very disappointed."

","First of all, Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl was simply amazing. The CGI was top notch and you won't complain about how horrible and fake looking it was. The acting was amazing, probably because of the super casting Johnney Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Geofrey Rush, were most likely the best actors at the time and still are.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean Mans Chest is no different. The CGI was amazing, especially Davy Jones who looked like a real keeper of the sea. His tentacles were astonishing, his face was creepy and disgusting in a good way and his body was great. Also how can anyone forget the Kraken which looked amazingly real and scary. Davy Jones crew was quite the cast that I won't be forgetting for a while, and the fight scenes were much better than the 1st.<br/><br/>The acting was just as good if not better than the 1st. Bill Nighy did a great job of playing Davy Jones and Johnney Depp proved to us again that he is the only man on earth who can play Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom did a fantastic job of playing Will Turner just like in Curse of the Black Pearl and Keira Knightley also did splendidly.<br/><br/>Overall: This is the best movie of 2006 so far. The CGI was amazing and very believable. The acting was great, especially Jack Sparrow, the movie itself is so astonishing that you won't be looking at your watch at all. Some might think this is a bad movie because it is too long, but time doesn't mean anything ( look at Titanic, Return of the King, King Kong, Godfather ). People might think this is a bad review, but you can believe whatever you want, just like Pirates. 10/10"
"uema","10","3","4","30 October 2006"," That is the most entertaining movie!!
","The movie I chose the best for me, ""The Pirates of The Caribbean"" is very exciting and little bit grotesque but contains something like comedy and adventure. Ms. Elizabeth (Keira Knitay) and Will turner (Orland Bloom) is about to marry soon but, they are caught by the national supreme court because they helped the wicked pirates, Captain Jack Sparrow (Jonny Depp) is liable to the death penalty. While, Jack Sparrow is facing a big problem that he is cursed by horrible evil of the sea Davy Jones. Will turner fights to get married to Elizabeth. Jack fights to save his life. They fight to stake their pride and save what the most important for them. Now, how is the destiny of them?? And what is the last way they reach?? <br/><br/>This movie interesting because its cast is very cool and the story is excites audience a lot. Story is changing continually and never wearing making, so we're fascinated the movement. What the only I don't like so much is the scene which Jack appears is a little bit few. And limiting the second movie, Jack does nothing but run away the enemy and deceives his friend. I really hope that Jack will be cool in the sequel movie. The hero of the second movie is Will turner I think. he is try to help his father and make come true that they will be able to marry. He looked much more dependable and stronger than the first movie."

Dead Man's Chest is a sequel, so you need to have an idea about the who's who in Pirates.<br/><br/>I won't tell any details about it because this is one of the best summer films this year and worth seeing!!"

","I wasn't sure if I was going to like the movie. The short clips of weird mutated pirates in the trailer didn't really make it better; it made the movie seem like a bad remake of the first one, with the same or similar ""cursed pirate"" plot. After watching it, however, I couldn't've been more wrong.<br/><br/>Though the Davy Jones crew ARE cursed in a kind of way and though some people may think the writers couldn't come up with anything new, the ingenious creativity and witty dialogue of the first motion picture reproduced itself upon ""Dead Man's Chest"". Even with the change of composers, a fact that had bothered me because I thought the first movie's music helped mold it into what it is, the sequel managed to retain the same taste.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp did it again, and his mastery of the character of Jack Sparrow is awesome. I can't think of any other actor who could've mimicked the climactic moment when he calls Elizabeth ""Pirate"" after she tied him to the sinking ship.<br/><br/>That, plus the added treat of meeting old characters again and an ending that will leave you grinning from ear to ear and leaning forward on your seat, only makes for a 10 out of 10.<br/><br/>So, viewers, rejoice!

","My husband and I both loved the first Pirates movie and were really looking forward to the sequel. What a letdown! The plot is ridiculously confusing, the violence is long and gratuitous, and most of the crew of Davy Jones' ship looks like rejects from a ""Star Wars"" movie. The cannibals on the island looked like a combination of Australian aborigines and African natives---not the Caribs which would have been inhabiting the islands. Yes, we know it's just-pretend, but would it really have been that difficult to introduce a modicum of historical accuracy? <br/><br/>Where is the witty script that so enchanted us in the first movie? There were about 3 funny lines in the entire yawn-fest. Believe me, we weren't the only ones who thought so---the entire audience was dead silent. <br/><br/>Where is the contrast between the lovely, feminine, elegant Kiera Knightly and the scummy pirates? Part of the fun in the first movie was that she was so prim and proper except when she got drunk on rum. THAT was part of what made the movie work so well. <br/><br/>What became of the dashing bravado and humor that Johnny Depp displayed so adeptly in the first movie? He was so deliciously foppish in spite of his piratical ways. This may be the most overblown, over-hyped, pretentious movie of all times---shame on you, Hollywood! <br/><br/>By the way---I hear my 8 year old nephew LOVED it! If you have the mind of an 8 year old you might, too."

","What a dismal sequel, it seemed to have been made to cash in on the first and at the same time make way for a third. The term cash-cow comes to mind. This movie is just too long and uninteresting. Davey Jones and his crew are just a mess of special effects more distracting than entertaining. Compared to the first film, Dead Man's Chest was a big disappointment. I loved the first film and the special effects with the crew being dead made the SF believable but the Davey Jones character made the whole thing a joke. I have the 1st film on DVD, it is a very good film, but for me that is where it all ends. I did watch the third one to see if they had recaptured the magic of the first one but it was even more dire than the 2nd. Johnny Depp created one of cinemas great characters in Jack Sparrow and it is a shame that they didn't make sequels more along the lines of his humour with some good old swashbuckling thrown in."

","I saw the movie last week  I was in shock afterwards. <br/><br/>What happened to the Pirates of the Caribbean the first  I was looking forward to the sequel of a sophisticated full of wit. I especially enjoyed the fact that everybody - but most of all Jonny Depp - was able not to take themselves too serious. Let's admit it, the genre Pirate Movie can only be endured nowadays when it is not taken seriously. It may be unfair to compare the second movie with the first - the commercial pressure on the second is certainly much higher than on a first one of a sequel..... But the first one had a story - as opposed to clichés, it had characters as opposed to wooden sticks in costumes, it had wit - as opposed to ...I don't even have a word for it. <br/><br/>Why shorten the role of Jack Sparrow, Captain Jack Sparrow? He is supposed to be the antidote to the boring characters of hero and heroine!!!!!!!!! Neither Keira nor Orlando are good enough to rescue a movie disaster. Who believes that special effects are a substitute for a story? And those special effects were just silly I just realise that the longer I write about this movie the more time of my live I am wasting on this stuff"

His only chance of avoiding this terrible fate is to try and locate a chest containing the heart of Davey Jones. But even with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly), and his loyal crew, the quest will be a perilous one.<br/><br/>With an amazing cast and amazing production values, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is simply bursting at the seams with amazing stunts, amazing special effects and amazing action set-pieces. But what is most amazing about this film is that director Gore Verbinski still somehow fails to deliver a finished product that is equal to the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>This sequel to his own 2003 blockbuster, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest is an overlong, incomprehensible mess of a movie, which has all of the right elements but no decent story on which to hang them. The dreadfully structured and convoluted plot jumps from one event to another with seemingly no attempt at a coherent narrative and totally wastes its wealth of great characters.<br/><br/>At nearly two-and-a-half hours long, the film pads out its extremely ill-conceived script with endless, and ultimately very dull, fight scenes and a glut of admittedly impressive, but often unnecessary, CGI effects. In fact, if as much effort had been put into crafting a decent tale as was obviously put into realising the movie's monstrous villains, Dead Man's Chest might have been a whole lot better.<br/><br/>As it stands, though, I'd rather be keelhauled than be made to watch this bilge again."

","""Dead Man's Chest"" is basically an amplified version of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" So if you adored the first movie, you'll probably get a kick out of this one; but if you, like me, are in the minority that considers the first movie entertaining but overrated, you'll probably have even less patience with ""Dead Man's Chest.""<br/><br/>Where ""Black Pearl"" had a silly and convoluted plot involving a crew of undead sailors, ""Dead Man's Chest"" has an even sillier and more convoluted plot centered on a different crew of undead sailors, this time led by tentacle-faced Davy Jones (reliable character actor Bill Nighy). Because each character in this movie has his or her own quest, which involves going on subsidiary quests to find other people or objects that they require for help, the structure quickly becomes overstuffed. However, the number of competing characters does provide for an exciting chase sequence near the endas long as you can remember what everyone's motivations are for taking part.<br/><br/>For ""Dead Man's Chest"" to make sense, you must also remember what happened in the first movie, because most of the characters (even those who made little impression in ""Black Pearl,"" such as Norrington) recur. But, ironically, you would also do well to forget the first movie, because this one recycles many of the same jokes and scenarios. The actors have amplified their old performances without exploring any new ground: Johnny Depp is woozier, Keira Knightley feistier, and Orlando Bloom blander than in the original film. Action sequences are bigger and busier; despite ""Dead Man's Chest""'s 2.5-hour running time, there's no room for a simple one-on-one swordfight like Depp and Bloom's in ""Black Pearl.""<br/><br/>So ""Dead Man's Chest"" is bloated, convoluted, and not particularly original. But I found myself enjoying parts of it nonetheless. One sequence set on a cannibal island has no bearing on the plotits only purpose is to let Johnny Depp make a fool of himself, but he does this so willingly that it's a pleasure to watch. The director and writers didn't take any risks with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, but they didn't embarrass themselves or betray the spirit of the first movie, either. And hey, at least you know what you're in for."

The first installment of POTC was fresh, witty, and captivating and I finished with the same feeling I get whenever I watch a good movie. Jack Sparrow had to be one of my favorite characters of all time. The second pretty much did away with all of those sentiments. I knew the movie was gonna suck when I saw Jack tied up ready to be eaten. It only got worse from there. What was the point of all this!!? why? I think they should have left it alone (Obviously that was out of the question considering what a huge cash cow they had on their hands) But if they absolutely HAD to make it, why make the characters act completely out of character from their previous personas that we had come to know and love. That was very jarring to me as a viewer and it was a big part of the ruining of the movie. Other than that it just seemed like they were overdoing everything to a point where my 6-year-old sister would probably find it corny. Cmon the scene with the wheel or whatever was just ridiculous. I probably won't see the third one, because I don't want to support this bullshit that disneys feeding us.

","Gotta be honest, the first Pirates of the Caribbean flick didn't really do it for me. Before you start firing your cannons at me or plan on starting a mutiny, allow me to explain myself. The first Pirates of the Caribbean, was well directed and made and all that, but as far as story goes, I found it a big bore for some reason. Of course this has nothing to do with Johnny Depps masterful, memorable and Oscar nominated performance as Jack Sparrow which I loved right from the get go. So, I was one of those guys who thought that the only saving grace that the first movie had was Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. Now after the enormous success of the first one here comes the bigger sequel. In other words, if Dead Mans Chest follows the rules of being the sequel to a successful film right, we should get more of everything. More effects, more action, more comedy! More Jack Sparrow! I'm glad to say the film successfully achieved all of these and then some! This time around Jack Sparrow is running away from a supernatural evil pirate called Davey Jones. You see, Jack owes Davey Jones his soul, but of course Jack being the sleaze bag trickster that he is doesn't want to pay up what he owes. Instead he chooses to run away and find a way to destroy Davey Jones and his crew of half human half fish pirates. This enrages Davey who conducts a search for Jack across the seven seas, leading us to a cannibal infested island, giant octopuses and strange half man half fish creatures.<br/><br/>Little did I suspect that this was going to be the best movie of the summer. I mean literally, it took me by surprise. The big anticipation this summer for me was Superman which for various reasons I wont get into here was great and at the same time disappointing. But here comes Pirates of the Caribbean blowing me away. As this film progressed I realized what a huge production it was, everything is bigger and better here. From the monsters (giant octopuses ROCK!) to the sets (loved that cannibal island!) to the villains (Gotta give props to Davey Jones, what a cool villain!) and the comedy. Yup this film had it all and it turned out to be a really entertaining film of epic proportions.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie of course is having Johnny Depp return to one of his best roles. Like I said before, the thing everyone loved the most about the first flick was Depps Jack Sparrow and on this sequel we get plenty of him. Jack is funnier, trickier and in a strange way more lovable then the first since the guy finally learns that sometimes we have to do the right thing. All the supporting characters were great, I loved some of the jokes coming from some of the lesser important pirates. Orlando Bloom was in the movie, but honestly he has very little to do in this one, since most of the film focuses a whole lot more on the chemistry developing between Keira Knightly and Jack Sparrow and the action and effects.<br/><br/>Speaking of effects, another great bonus on this film is that the effects are truly spectacular. Getting wowed by effects is getting increasingly difficult for me, but Ill be damned if this one really had me saying wow every five seconds. The gigantic octopus known as the Kraken freaking rocked! Some of the extended effects sequences with the octopus were extremely exciting and incredible to watch. It brought back memories of scenes from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and seeing Kirk Douglas battling rubber tentacles. On this film Gore Verbinsky has orchestrated a truly memorable monster sequence. One for the books! And speaking of memorable monsters, I loved Bill Nighy as Davey Jones. Its only fair that since Jack Sparrow is such a memorable anti hero we should also get an equally formidable villain. And such is the case with Davey Jones. Aside from the fact that Mr. Jones has a striking look to him (all about the tentacled beard!) the character itself moves and talks in a very interesting and different manner. Loved the way the bad guys looked in this film! So visually speaking get ready for some cool stuff.<br/><br/>Of course the guys behind making this film are very smart. They know how much audiences love Jack Sparrow and they know we want to see more of him which is probably why the movie ends with a cliffhanger ending. They literally leave you gasping for more even though the movie last well more then two hours! So be ready for a Lord of the Rings type of ending where you go WHAT? No way it just ended there! So to me, this was the true spectacle of the summer. Incredible effects, great action, great characters and just plain fun. After all ain't that what summer movies are supposed to be about? Fun big budget special effect spectacles! And this one delivers in spades. So trust me on this one maties, we got ourselves a winner! Rating: 5 out of 5"
"pumasgoya","2","4","6","22 July 2006"," one of the worst
","one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Perhaps if I were 12 I'd want to see this movie more than once. Action movies seem to be at a real low point as of late. Half the time I couldn't even look at the screen cause of the barnacled sea creatures up there were just ugly. Wow I wish I hadn't gone to see this movie. How many times can you watch a movie where the skinny girl who couldn't tear open an envelope beats up on and actually kills bad guys? This has been done to the point where I'm not rooting for them anyone, but rather for her to be killed off or something. There are so many holes in the story that are overlooked by its fans simply because they get more special effects to distract them. I think I'll just stop here as I'm more than sure that all of these fans of this poor excuse to ruin the Pirate ride at Disneyland will be saying how great of a movie it is. Yeah sure, just look back at the Lord of the Rings movies to realize that no one will care in a few years."
"greg07","2","4","6","10 July 2006"," Another Hollywood Sham
","Once again, moviegoers have been bamboozled by Hollywood and the always painful art of turning a very successful and well-made movie like The Curse of the Black Pearl into a 3 part movie franchise that belies the legacy of the first movie. The ghosts of The Matrix: Reloaded return in this god awful sequel to one of my favorite movies that does nothing in 2 hours and 45 minutes but set up a 3rd movie and make your bag of popcorn turn cold.<br/><br/>For the first 30 or 40 minutes of the movie, I was entertained in being largely reminded of how much I liked the first movie of this series. By the time the lights came up in the theater, I wanted to throw something at the screen. That being said, the studio who produced this is genius because no matter how much this second movie has been destroyed by the critics, it would take tremendous self-control not to see the third POTC just to get ANY sense of closure. There was absolutely nothing resolved in this movie except 150 minutes of consumer manipulation.<br/><br/>The most frustrating part was that all the pieces were in place: great special effects (that went a little past unsettling at times), the same great cast, and a pretty good plot setup. It appears, however, that Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio are much better at adapting screenplays than actually writing one themselves. I get the feeling that so much time was spent on creating an entire ship's crew of half human, half fish characters that someone forgot to write an actually entertaining screenplay. The few times when the script was decent was when lines were basically copied and pasted from the first movie. As a result, Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, and Orlando Bloom left much to be desired, but not by their own faults. I have to echo the Boston Globe's comment that Johnny Depp ""mailed it in,"" but he could not have done any better with the script he was given.<br/><br/>Bottom line- you will see this movie, you will be mildly entertained at times, you will be left with a feeling of emptiness at the finish, and then you will attempt to fill that emptiness by going to see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End when it comes out next Summer, only to find you could never quite recapture that great feeling of the first movie of the series- and the POTC franchise will win. Sound like a familiar plot line? This is the Matrix trilogy all over again- they even found an excuse to toss in some bullet time technology."
"casualspidey","9","4","6","8 July 2006"," great film
","i never saw the first film, but i was eagerly anticipating this film. it just looked really incredible and it delivered. so many question left unanswered, can't wait for the 3rd film. this movie has a level of heart in it. i felt for davy jones, for some odd reason i think William might end up like him. remember sparrow was speaking to him about how jones was suppose to get married and all but lost his wife to someone else. that whole moment describes William. especially at the end( for those who saw the film you know what I'm talking about. the special effects we're top notch. acting? great, story? fun what you guys need to keep in mind is there's a trilogy so i understand if you felt this sequel didn't give a full disclosure, but I'm really looking towards the third one to see how the story lines in this film is resolved."
"daciabianca","9","4","6","8 July 2006"," Why is the rum always gone?
","If you think someone should watch the movie, you don't tell them the whole thing for goodness sakes people! That's why I've decided to post a comment. Anyway, here goes...<br/><br/>We've got the same cast, same thrilling music, same director, same writers, and same Caribbean baby!! What more can you ask for? Unless... Heath Ledger, Elijah Wood, and Jeremy Sumpter were to pop up as new characters-O.K. now I'm letting my imagination run off. But really, Ted & Terry did another amazing job with the writing; I don't know how they do it - much respect. Someone posted the comment that they were trying too hard or forcing things. In my opinion, they observed the way Johnny played his character *Captain* Jack Sparrow and played off of that nicely.<br/><br/>Someone also said that DMC was darker. I found it to be more humorous. Capt. Jack was hilarious and Will and Elizabeth also added a bit of comedy here and there.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were sensational. I couldn't believe that they actually got to do some of their stunts with the giant wheel. When Norrington, Jack, and Will are all fighting each other while Elizabeth helplessly throws rocks at them there was a roar of laughter in the theatre.<br/><br/>On the contrary to what another poster has said I don't believe ""it doesn't take itself seriously."" Johnny Depp wouldn't participate in a film if it wasn't taken seriously. They also said ""unlike the first one the second one wasn't realistic."" Did you forget about the whole cursed pirates never dying and turning into skeletons in the moonlight thing? But it's all fun, and don't spoil that!! <br/><br/>Although I thought this movie was fast-paced, exciting, funny, and had a lot of shocking surprises, I'm going to have to disagree again by saying I don't think it was better than the Black Pearl. That person may be saying that because they've just seen Dead Man's Cheast. Perhaps they should watch BP and compare the two. I will say that they are about equal to me.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp may be pulling an Adam Sandler by having his fellow co-stars in several movies with him. Some guards in BP and Mackenzie Crook(Ragetti) play in Finding Neverland. Also there is Lor Cutler Beckett from DMC and the third film, At World's End, who's in The Libertine and Pride and Prejudice with Kiera. Comador Norrington is also in The Libertine and the links go on and on. I love when actors do that; it's so fun to see them working together again.<br/><br/>We are introduced to some fun new characters, Tia (whom I think though she is hard to look at because of her ugliness might have been one of Captn. Jack's old flings. She really isn't ugly in real life by the way), Davy Jones, Boots-straps Bill and others. Also you will be delighted to see some familiar faces you may not have expected to see. You'll have to go see it to find out who that is!! Captn. Jack is the same, however other characters have changed a bit and I think we'll have to wait until the final film to see what that's about. Will Turner's character has also expanded, but still not completely developed yet I think.Again, perhaps we must wait until the third film.<br/><br/>Capt. Jack's entrance was just as good as his entrance in BP - brilliant and might I be so bold to say he is the BEST pirate you've ever heard of. The ending is a shocker. I can't wait to see what will happen next, and Keith Richards (Johnny's inspiration for the character) will make a cameo appearance as Capt. Jack's father!! How cool is that? He was actually supposed to be in this one, but was busy.<br/><br/>To the people who keep complaining about the ending leaving them hanging - I'm sure you'll recall that The Lord of Rings didn't have an ending to every movie either, but that is the point!! It's a trilogy. We should be glad they filmed the second and third film at the same time or else it would be coming out even later. And for those people who are saying DMC was a disappointment, I can guarantee they'll be in the theatre watching the third film when it comes out.<br/><br/>The ONLY thing I didn't like in the movie (being an animal lover) was the scene when Captn. Jack was being chased by the cannibals and didn't rescue the dog with the key (from the first film) but ran right past him. I thought good ole Captn. Jack will surely swipe him up or turn round for him (after all they do have history together), but sadly he didn't. Then they show the cannibals chasing the poor thing and I as well as some other people in the theatre shook our heads. Awww noooo. *But I'm told I should have stayed until the end of the credits because it has something to do with the dog.* Maybe it's like the first film where after all the credits are finished the monkey takes the medallion. Something to think about; so stay and watch the credits!!<br/><br/>This movie will do wonderful because it's a movie the entire family can enjoy - for real!! Truly, age doesn't matter, give this movie a shot and you wont regret it. It's also a good movie for couples because it's not a chick-flick, but the girls will love it just as much as the guys (I know I did). And if you're looking for an adventure this summer, look no further. So just sit back and allow yourself to get lost in it!!<br/><br/>Now, you have your heading mates, so cast off and go see it you scalywags. Let's say it all together - Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. The rum is gone? Oh bugger."
"stuckhere4ever","9","4","6","7 July 2006"," A wonderful experience till the very end
","One of the best movies I have seen in a long time, hands down. Depp plays his character magnificantly. He once again makes Jack Sparrow come to life before our eyes.<br/><br/>Knightly, who has made me tremble in some of her other performance, had amazing chemistry with both Bloom and Depp, and played the part of the ragged sailor much better then could ever be expected. <br/><br/>Twists and turns till the very end, this movie will leave you wanting to see it again, and pray the next chapter finds its way to us sooner. <br/><br/>A second epic with the right to be placed next to The Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>9/10"
"ryot","9","4","6","7 July 2006"," A very fun movie.
","I just saw the midnight showing, the theater was PACKED but thats beside the point. From the start of the movie it has that original Pirates charm, and mixes action/adventure drama and comedy almost seamlessly. Right when the excitement of a scene reaches its peak there's a joke made which catches the audience totally of guard and keeps the movie from being to serious while not making it a pure comedy. The acting for 9/10ths of the actors is great. Tough there are a few characters with very little parts that is just okay. But Depp, Bloom, and Knightly really steal the show as you would think. But there is a very very want to slap him performance of Norringtin.<br/><br/>The special effects are great, tough some points you can tell aren't real but its not that noticeable. Tough, a lot of the FX as in the tentacles of Davy Jones is awesome as are the make up effects. The plot has plenty of twists and turns at the end with a old character you'd never expect showing up in the last 30 seconds of the cliffhanger ending.<br/><br/>If it wasn't for the few average FX then it would be a perfect ten. But this is a movie that the entire family will enjoy, me and my annoying teenage friends kicking other peoples seat in the back of the theater and throwing popcorn enjoyed it so did the children in the front row watching. But if you have a really young child you may want to watch with them as it can be a bit dark at times, as the first one.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT!"
"twoandfour","3","10","20","23 July 2006"," A victim of it's own success
","I'll say this right off the bat; this is not a good movie. Not ""this is not as good as the original"" but just poor movie making in general.<br/><br/>Why? First of all, it's too long by at least 30 minutes. And I'd guess most of those 30 minutes could have been excised by scaling back on the mind-numbing gore scenes. I guess the producers wanted as much of the budget on the screen so we're treated to scene after scene of pointless sea zombies pulsing and oozing. Very stupid.<br/><br/>Then there is the story, if you can call it that. In an effort to reprise as many of the featured roles from the first film, all kinds of vignettes are created to justify their presence in this mess.<br/><br/>Finally, the biggest problem is the very thing that made the first movie so unique, Johnny Depp's performance. All the quirks that made his Jack Sparrow such an unforgettable character in movie #1 are so amplified in this film that it also seems like a parody instead of a performance. This is the first time I've seen Depp mug for the camera and it's very difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Well, there is one more thing, it's no secret that POTC #3 was shot in tandem with this movie but the ending was so clichéd and sudden that it seems as if the whole plot of this movie was simply to set up the next.<br/><br/>Save your money, rent the DVD and be very wary of installment number three."
"kindred090","4","10","20","9 July 2006"," Long bore with great effects.
","Overall I give this movie a 4. Although some of the acting and most of the special effects were incredible there were times I couldn't help but wonder what went wrong. The first Pirates of the Caribbean was a fun and remarkably joyous film, where this one is slow and plodding with multiple mistakes throughout. I keep trying to figure out why they would take a fun film and put in even more cheesy comedy that makes no impact on the poor story line. This movie will do great in theaters due only to the fact that the first one was so great. I see people bringing young children to see this movie, and per the first one that shouldn't be a problem. However, be warned, this is a darker and much more death filled film. Worth the price to see it once, and maybe rent later."
"mickey7733","3","34","87","7 July 2006"," Terrible, terrible disappointment.
","I'm giving it a 3/10.<br/><br/>So I'm not gonna lie, I was a big fan of the first movie, but the new one did NOT impress me at all... I was completely disappointed, and upset that I spent $10 to stay up till 2:30 in the morning terribly bored, when I could've stayed home for free and be equally as enthralled while watching the Home Shopping channel.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is prime example of the terrible Hollywood sequels that are oh too common. It's more than obvious how the movie creators are trying too hard to appeal to the crowd, what with cheap one-liners from the first movie (the whole ""where's the rum?"" bit, etc), and more sorry attempts at comedy than sustenance. I mean, where's the plot? Instead of working on a story, they decided to give us warped farces of our old favourite characters. Elizabeth Swann is having stupid temper tantrums and is suddenly an expert fencer, Orlando Bloom's character is a melodramatic wuss trying to act all ""I'm a romantic hero,"" and Jack Sparrow is babbling on, making no sense, and doesn't stop talking about the stupid rum.<br/><br/>From what I could tell, the creators clearly do not understand that special effects do NOT make the movie. It seems like they used the past 3 years exerting themselves to make grand special effects sequences, instead of focusing on a meaningful dialog, as well as general storyline. The movie bored me. And instead of sitting there thinking about the movie and the plot and what's coming next, I was sitting there thinking about how weird and bizarre and unrealistic the characters seemed. At least the first movie with the idea of that curse and all had previously mentioned sustenance in it. It gave the characters reason for going after something. Will Turner/Elizabeth Swann's love for one another is not enough to hold my interest.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was a terrible disappointment, and was probably the worst movie I've seen in theatres since ""The Village."""
"gmherp-1","1","7","13","28 July 2006"," Sorry for the late warning!
","This is so much worse than the first Pirates movie! I slept through a great deal of it and was sorry I didn't sleep longer. To me, the elements of a good movie are that it should keep your interest throughout, make you care about the characters, and leave you with a little different perspective on life. This movie lacked all three elements. Really good movies evoke a strong emotion (preferably a pleasant one), but do something other than bore you to tears. Pirates has many dark scenes with gross, gory, slimy, sickening effects, most done to redundancy, such as the character Davy Jones' beard made of octopus tentacles. In one scene, Johnny Depp has blue eyes painted on his eyelids so that when he closes his eyes, it looks like he is looking at you with these very blue eyes. During that scene, he closes his eyes A LOT, in case you happened to miss the cleverness of it all. All the movie had to say was ""Oh, look at my clever special effects"". That's it. A gigantic waste of a whole lot of people's time and way too much money. If there is anyone, anywhere who has not already seen this movie...DON'T BOTHER!"
"buntromb","1","7","13","28 July 2006"," Does not even compare to the first one
","This movie was very poor, and it will probably go down as the worst big box office hit ever. The only reason it will gross more then the original, is because people like me didn't see the first in theaters, bought the DVD, and then were eager to see the second one. After seeing the first ten minutes of the film i wanted to leave the theater, but couldn't because my girlfriend wanted to stay. This film is mostly dark and dreary and we don't get the shots and views that made the first film so romantic. This film is supposed to be about pirating, and the character of Davey Jones is absolutely horrible, and ruined the movie for me. He does not look like a Pirate, and is a cross between something from the Aliens movies, or something from Morodor in the Lord of the Rings. This movie is supposed to about pirates, not aliens! The plot is convoluted and twisted and is revealed by a clairvoyant with a Jamaican accent, making it very hard to understand. A character like Captain Barbosa is clearly missing from this film, and his appearance at the very end was the best part of the entire film, which does not say much. Most of the scenes are dominated by Davie Jones and his hideous looking gang talking in deep voices in a dark dreary non exciting atmosphere. The day light shots that we do get are dominated by an unneeded sub plot of Jack being made God by a bunch of cannibals, and a ridiculous (even for movie standards) three way sword fight between Jack, Will, and Captain Norringtone. The ending is very abrupt, with Captain Barbosa somehow coming back to life, and being able to lead the gang in there quest to find Jack Sparrow. His return promises to make the third movie better, and hopefully the directors will cut down the role of Davie Jones in the next one. My advice to anyone who saw the first in theaters and is thinking about seeing this one, is to spend your dollars on the Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl DVD, and wait for the third installment."
"Nerdboy1423","4","7","13","23 July 2006"," Horrible characters and a preposterous plot
","I liked the original Pirates of the Caribbean, I liked it, but I did not love it. For one, the whole going back and forth from Isle del Muerta to Port Royale and to the ships to the Isle del Muerta just became numbing after awhile. They could have tightened that script a lot and cut the amount of running around. That was basically my only complaint in a film that I bought solely for Jack Sparrow. I figured that since that complaint was not mine alone, many other critics found the film redundant, that the screenwriters would pay heed, but instead have thrown narrative completely to the wind and have made a film that is completely running back and forth from location to location with one ridiculously pointless excursion to a Cannibal island which was actually well done but didn't fit the rest of the film. And since everyone is just running around all the time, you can't really pay attention to the crappier acting by Johnny Depp, playing it more straight this time and the otherworldly visual effects that are probably some of the best I've ever seen wasted on a horrible film. The film feels completely all over the place and has memorable scenes but never stops to take it's breath and feel it's way around for an emotional moment or two. I know the end is supposed to be bitter and sad but I didn't feel anything since they basically said that Sparrow wasn't dead. So the movie was pointless, made to make money and to continue a franchise that may be funny but lacks the spirit of older better Pirate adventure films. So the short is, this is not a film, it is a visual effects demo reel."

","Ridiculous, I can't believe the trend with trilogy films. Who wants to wait an entire year or whatever length of time they think they can milk this one for. I feel like I've been cheated out of my time and money. All I got was more plot beginnings than I knew what to do with and then no foreseeable conclusions to any of them. These trilogy films remind me of a soap opera, ""Tune in next week for the conclusion..."".<br/><br/>Compared to the first one, dead man's chest was really dark, much more so than I had expected to see from a Disney film. Not that I mind, but it had no flow with the first one at all. All the characters apparently needed deeper personality traits. I didn't need all that ""inner turmoil"" between the leading characters.<br/><br/>I haven't felt this cheated since I saw the 2nd part of the Matrix trilogy.<br/><br/>*until I saw the third part of the Matrix trilogy*"
"pablum-wag","7","9","18","6 July 2006"," Quite good... for the first half
","First off, I'd like to say that I came into the cinema pretty much with high expectations. I thoroughly enjoyed the first installment and jumped at the first chance I got to see it. So having watched it three and a half hours ago on opening day, take into account that I've probably yet to digest the whole movie.<br/><br/>So we all know Pirates 2 and 3 were filmed back to back, yeah? What i hadn't expected was the movies to seem like they were meant to watched that way. Pirates 2 doesn't have much of an ending... and while it launches off very well the last half hour was almost a bit painful.<br/><br/>During the movie I was reminded of King Kong (the recent one) and LOTR (particularly the Ents with a certain character).<br/><br/>As for the actors...<br/><br/>Orlando look rather dashing... that's all I'll say for that. Johnny Depp was pretty good as usual, although his accent swayed a bit. Less than Bill Nighy's - which I'm not so sure but should have been Scottish. As for Keira Knightly, I couldn't really get passed the fact that in most shots it seemed like she was always trying to make her nose narrower.<br/><br/>I think I'd definitely rush to see the third installment. What Pirates 2 really set out well was some real solid (and scary) antagonists. Although there wasn't too much of a resolve (at all) at the end and as much as i understood that a lot was probably sacrificed to set up the third. In quite honesty, the last minute/scene/shot pretty much killed it. Plain cheesy even. It devastated me.<br/><br/>The special effects and make up were particularly well done. Nothing look unrealistic (as far as seas monster go) at all. So that was really satisfying. Especially boot strap Bill... I thought the attached starfish and muscles was completely genius."
"vitaleralphlouis","3","6","11","5 August 2006"," Depp vs. SquidMan -- Pirates #2 Disappoints Hard.
","We were eager to lay down our $7.50 per ticket for the picture most likely to be the #1 hit of 2006. Our seating was perfect, the theater top notch. No cell phone distractions. The problem was the movie itself. No pirate adventure at all, just a silly self-parody with special effects excess. Johnny Depp was downright boring with his rehash of the mannerisms from the first film. There was neither character development nor suspense. There was no fright. In 2006, films can excess at fright, but there is just nothing scary about either a man in a Halloween Squid Man costume, nor in a giant rubber sea monster. The filmmakers give us not one reason to care about what happens to anybody. I like Keira Knightly, a lot, but it takes more than a pretty girl to make a good movie. Sadly, today's young audience may have never seen a good pirate movie. The Sea Hawk, Captain Blood, Blackbeard, Crimson Pirate or Anne of the Indies are seldom revived. Hollywood would not be capable of making another quality pirate movie. They have no stars of the stature of Errol Flynn or Burt Lancaster. Dead Man's Chest wasn't as bad as Peter Jackson's awful King Kong movie, but each in its own way demonstrates why 2005 and 2006 are the worst years in motion picture history in terms of quality. God save us from Pirates #3."

I was a little disappointed by Depp and Knightley's performances, the acting lacked the passion and intensity that existed in the first movie. The new characters did add to the movie and provide unique twists. The action scenes were almost as good as the first. The scenery was actually better than the first movie. The make up job of the eyes (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it) was really cool.

I could rap off the one liners that made the first great, but here there are none that come to mind. Remember how Barbosa was a villain, but had a sense of humor... yeah, well don't expect that from Davy Jones. They tried to make him all evil which sucked. So, he's slimy and all his tools are slimy, but did they really need to make the whole movie have that green slimy tint. Another failed sequel.

There was no plot, in anyway, and at every glimmer of a plot a new fight scene would be introduced and the plot would become elusive again. Even the talented cast couldn't save this movie. Maybe it's due to the writers that didn't want to write new material and just recycled the jokes from the last movie.

I was completely let down and have never been so disappointed in a movie in my life! I LOVED the first Pirates of the Caribbean but this one was like ""we've lost all our money soooo...lets end right about.....HERE!"" Oh, and Keira Knightly forgot how she even talked in the first one and has a completely different accent lol. The friends that went with me couldn't believe how the movie ended up being. We went the first weekend it was out. Pirates of the Caribbean failed to make any good impact on our good time together. I thought it my duty to not let people think that movie was something that it was not...which is good.<br/><br/>It's a 2 just because Johnny Depp is still decent in the movie, so it's not a 1."
"Dearcy","5","8","16","11 July 2006"," Eh.
","Let me preface this comment by saying that I absolutely adored PotC: Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>I judge a movie based on its ability to keep my attention. By about the 1 hour 50 minute mark, PotC: Dead Man's Chest had me making origami out of my candy wrapper. Be prepared for basically 2 hours and 20 minutes of set-up for a movie that won't be out until 2007.<br/><br/>It has some great fight sequences and Bill Nighy is the man. I loved Tia Dalma as well.<br/><br/>If you are a fan, you should slog through it. Hopefully you will enjoy it more than I did."
"myssjo_23b","6","8","16","9 July 2006"," No heart . . .
","""Dead Man's Chest"" is an overly-ambitious jumble of characters, settings, and effects that fail to deliver a story worth the journey... The characters we thought we knew from the first film, are lost in hard-to-follow plot lines. Like Jack's compass, they don't know what they really want. To add to confusion, there are several passages of dialogue that were impossible for the audience to understand. Captain Jack is still the man to watch, there is wonderful acting delivered by Johnny Depp. He, along with Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, are the saving grace of the film. But even Captain Jack seems distracted enough to throw his compass out of whack. Poor editing puts characters in one place after another with no clear explanation why. An example, for what purpose did Jack and his crew sail to Cannibal Island? I'm still perplexed as to how the characters wound up in the final scene. It is unfortunate that the special effects overpower character development in ""Dead Man's Chest"". While Davy Jone's octopus face is amazing to behold, the Kraken's tentacles are overdone. If more attention had been paid to the story line, these effects might have enhanced this film. As it is, it is a movie without a heart in more ways than one."
"quis_ego","1","8","16","9 July 2006"," Painfully boring
","I really disliked this film. The main reason? It was boring. Terribly terribly boring. Apparently it was 150 minutes, but it felt like 400. Lots happened. Too much happened, really - it was as though they stuck a collection of unrelated possible plots and action sequences into a tombola machine and then pulled several out at random, and glued them together end to end. With so much going on, it should have been exciting and entertaining but was instead, confusing, complicated and not engaging. Ah, if only as many hours had been spent on the script and the plot as were apparently spent on the CGI.<br/><br/>The only real 'character' in it this time is Norrington, who is now a bitter ex-Commodore and all the grubbier and more interesting for it - but everyone else from the first film is back, in the same old roles, but with no further character development at all. Come on Hollywood, have you forgotten? We need personalities! It's hard to care about one-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>The first film had 2 strong, interesting characters - Jack and Barbosa. This one still has Captain Jack, but he's far less entertaining than he was first time round, does less, says less, has fewer gags and doesn't come across anything like as forcefully as he did in the first film. It's a minor point, but costume wise, he's cleaner, his clothes are less tatty, he's got whiter teeth and very neatly-rolled dreads. Continuity?<br/><br/>Other things that grated: Will and Elizabeth were, if possible, even more wooden than last time. The film lacked the humour and originality of the first film, and was almost completely chuckle-free - and any jokes were re-cycled, less-funny versions of jokes from the first film. The gratuitous CGI monsters were a half-human, half-seafood mess and looked ridiculous rather than what was (presumably) supposed to be scary. Why does ""Davy Jones"" have a Scottish accent? If they have to give him a regional accent, shouldn't it have been Welsh? :><br/><br/>I probably shouldn't let a throwaway summer blockbuster annoy me so much, but I simply was not entertained by this in the way that I was entertained by the first film. It's a very poor followup."
"sebastien-derobillard","3","8","16","7 July 2006"," Disney offers little and delivers nothing, starring Johnny Depp
","A sequel so quickly rushed out after the huge success of the first is always a worrying thing, especially when an actor who's character was killed off in the first film is rumoured to have been involved in the production of the feature.<br/><br/>The film however, promises to deliver as much as the previous one, a rollicking and swashbuckling affair with an attract cast. A brilliant Johnny Depp led a funny and well written adventure piece, and even if it was not high art, it was just plain great fun. Good special effects by the ever-trying-yet-never-succeeding people at Disney studios worked wonders as well. This time however, the film struggles to find a plot that makes sense, and as the two hours drags along, questioning your motivation to view Gore Verbinski's bore fest, you realize that the rumours about a third film are true, and that the current film will not have a resolution, satisfying or not.<br/><br/>A quick surmise of the story; Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightly) are arrested on their wedding day and forced to hand over a bewitched compass for the owner/boss of the East India Trading Company. Turner searches out Captain Jack Sparrow, the owner of the special compass, who still owes his soul to Captain Davey Jones (Nighy) (you may recall he owed his soul to Geoffrey Rush's character in the first one as well). We are then sailing on rough seas being chased the Cracken and other demented sea creatures/sailors which all ends with a voodoo witch doctor telling them the information all the viewers know, there will be no ending for this film.<br/><br/>Even Depp seems bored in this film, bringing very little comedy or quirkiness into Jack Sparrow, the main reason for the success of the first film. He runs through the motions, while Bloom does little more than look his normal handsome self. Even Knightly offers little as the damsel-come-pirate-come-damsel. Nighy however is energetic as the evil, octopus like bad man, like Rush in the previous film, loves playing the baddie. The special effects are also a rather disappointing let down, with director Verbanksi failing in that department, re-hashing bad clichés rather than mastering good ones.<br/><br/>This film may excite the children, its primary audience, but leaves very little else for other viewers. The laughs are few and far between this film, and most of the time you will be thinking, 'What in the world is happening?'"
"lowyman1","4","8","16","7 July 2006"," Not even close to as good as the first one
","Although Johnny Depp was as excellent as he was in the previous movie he didn't really do anything new. All of the things that he did that were funny and clever in the first movie he did again in the second. What this movie lacked that the other had was a plot. I enjoyed the whole Davy Jones thing but it got old. It was also a really long movie, which doesn't bother me if you're showing the same sword fights over and over again.<br/><br/>I was disappointed and if the end hadn't been so good then I would have been even more disappointed.<br/><br/>I would still recommend seeing it."
"bopdog","3","8","16","7 July 2006"," Shamefull waste of talent and resources. Some bright bits, many tedious and ugly bits. It all adds up to nothing.
","What an ugly and un-inspired movie! Although watching this movie was a definite throwback to some of the old time Disney fare, and reminded me a bit of my childhood in movie theatres on a Saturday afternoon. Pirates was not quite as good as the dated but charming Swiss Family Robinson (1959, was it?), but it was about as bad as the dreadful Fitzwilly (1967).<br/><br/>Visiting Disneyland, you see rubber rocks in the faked-up 'wilderness' area. How hard would real rocks be to get? Disney movies are equally prone to the fake, when audiences would probably accept the real, even if the real stuff was flawed. This shows a tremendous disrespect for the audience on Disney Studio's part. As an example of the weird moral 'logic' Disney CAN at times stoop to, consider Pretty Woman--- about a hooker who meets Mr. Right and strikes it rich. The moral lesson of that Disney flick, evidently, was that only money matters, and having some cash to flash, and a trendy wardrobe, automatically makes you a person worthy of social position and respect.<br/><br/>Pirates has some moments that are interesting. But as you've probably heard, it's all flash, and no substance. There is no love, no romance, no likable characters we are rooting for. Nothing in the movie really matters. And some of the bits are so gruesome, gross, and ugly that I feel tainted merely by having seen them on the screen.<br/><br/>This movie is like being shown some old lady's button collection. Some of the bits are pretty, some interesting. Some ugly, many are dull and plain. But they don't add up to anything at all. When you're done looking at the buttons, you have nothing. Not even a rag doll or a simple garment. Just the experience of having handled somebody else's second-hand buttons.<br/><br/>Pirates of Caribbean, Deadman's Chest, is vapid at best, and immoral and a shameful waste of talent and resources at worst. Having just come from this dreck, I suspect the worst. I am embarrassed for the excellent and worthy cast. Disney should be ashamed. I need to go home and take a shower now."
"lesmisloony","3","8","16","7 July 2006"," Pirates 2? Argh.
","Okay, so I absolutely adore the original film, but I could barely sit through this one. All the old jokes are back, reused and hardly half as funny. Certain characters have undergone painful renovations and are nigh unrecognizable. The plot is jumbled at best, reeking of B movie.<br/><br/>I trusted Ted and Terry, but I must admit that this movie will be a disappointment to fans and probably terrify plenty of children. There is no real need for all of the violence that the audience is forced to watch. Perhaps the filmmakers forgot how many youngsters are devoted to the original? In the first movie, we actually cared about the villains. Even Barbossa had a human side--everyone wanted to see him take a bite out of that apple. The villains in this movie are flat and seem to exist for the sole purpose of showing off flashy special effects.<br/><br/>There is no tangible ""plot arc""; in fact, the movie doesn't end at all. Granted, the final twist is fun--I actually clapped when I realized what was happening--but all of the charm and light-hearted hilarity is gone; the jokes are as recycled as the soundtrack."

","I went to a midnight showing with a group of friends. We were very excited all day long in preparation for the movie...<br/><br/>and it did not meet any of our expectations. To put it briefly, I feel used, having seen that film. The ""stunning visuals"" were (excuse the pun) overboard. The CGI characters were so far-fetched that they made me cringe every time they appeared on screen. The plot seemed to revolve around setting the stage for the third film in this trilogy. And the ending... the ending was infuriating.<br/><br/>There were some nice moments from the actors. Johnny Depp is just as funny as before, but with my expectations as high as they were, it didn't seem as wonderful. Bloom and Knightley both had a chance to show off a bit more than in the first film and they did cash in on it.<br/><br/>The score is more or less regurgitated from the first film (it was great then, but now it's repetitive). Similarly, much of the comedy involves quotes of the first movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I am very disappointed by this movie."

"pete12","2","7","14","9 July 2006"," More Hollywood
","The 1st movie was a pleasant surprise - with great scriptwriting, and off the charts character development by Johnnie Dep. Pirates 2 is a different ball of wax. Have you ever noticed the red flags of movie execs meddling with a perfectly good movie? Pirates 2 has all the tell tale signs. (We can thank Johnnie Depp for salvaging the film). The biggest red flag in Pirates 2 are character and storyline digressions that are simply inserted to pander to a segment of viewers. Not to be too blunt ... but what purpose did the swamp lady really contribute? How about bootstrap Turner? Why is he the only crew member on the Flying Dutchman that still resembles a human? His make-up was god awful. What was he wearing? Was that a seaweed fez / and a moo-moo combination? Usually children, an old guy, a strong female, a mom, and an animal/pet are tacked-on to the storyline to ensure that everyone in the audience can find a character to relate to ... no matter how superfluous or pathetic that character might be.<br/><br/>I think the special effects on Davey Jones were amazing. His facial effects were so good (eyes, mouth etc) that i think exploring his backstory would have made world of difference. I am certain that any script writer worth his/her salary developed a brilliant back-story related to the Dutchman's heart, the abandoned colony, and the location of the chest. That could have been explored vs. that brutally long panning shot of the long-boat re-entering the swamp with those pathetic extras in the swamp holding candles. C'mon -- why are people standing in swamp water? That cr_p had Jar-jar binks written all over it. At least try to get details like accents correct so we don't continue raising another generation of idiot children. Is the Dutchman Dutch? If so - then why the Scottish accent."
"msketch21","6","7","14","8 July 2006"," A few less jokes would have given the film a stronger characters & plot
","I was entertained. I laughed throughout and enjoyed the action. It's not a bad film. But the plot was thin and the character development was lacking. If the jokes and action were trimmed a bit here and there, greater weight in the plot and character development could have easily been achieved. Unfortunately the film is yet another example of executives saying, ""Well they bought the premise the first time so now let's just give them more action and laughs."" Who doesn't like action and laughs? But if that's all you have the story gets old after a while and the characters never grow. Why is Terminator 2 a better film then the first? Because the plot was dynamic and the characters throughly changed within the story. Sure there was great action scenes, but the reason people keep watching the movie is because the character relations are so strong. Why was Terminator 3 not as good as 2? Because it was pumped up with action and jokes and lacked in character development. The first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is a great film, because the plot was solid and the character's were genuinely understood. And I'm not saying the plot of the sequel isn't interesting, it's simply under developed. I wanted more back story on Davy Jones and his ship, and stronger relations between Will & his father, Jack & Elizabeth. One might say ""That will come in the third installment."" And I say it better, because if all it is, is just more jokes and action then I won't see it."

However, you will the enjoy the movie more if you just go on the internet and find a picture of Davy instead of sitting through the whole movie. Since I went opening day, I was surrounded by Pirate fans. But even still, I saw plenty of people sleeping through the movie. <br/><br/>It wasn't the worst movie i've ever seen, but i wish i hadn't wasted my time on it.(And it was like 4 hours of my time because I HAD to see it opening day!)

","Being a fan of the first film I decided I would enjoy a midnight screening of Pirates of the Caribbean 2 with a bunch of fans of the film. The cinema got dark, the movie rolled, and roughly 2 hours later I realized what a letdown the movie really was.<br/><br/>My biggest letdown would have to be the story and character writing. Both were just poorly done. Character relationships built in the 1st movie were horribly continued and lacked any real emotional value. And the story moves too slow for too long and its hard to keep any real interest, and the fact that its confusing doesn't really help either. Basically it lacks action.<br/><br/>It also overplayed certain elements from the first film, especially the comedy which, good at times, was way too overdone. Certain characters roles were overplayed and just weren't as good.<br/><br/>The movie did have a good action sequence at the end and the CGI was pretty incredible on ILM's part, but the poor story really killed this film for me.<br/><br/>Just didn't live up to my personal expectations and not near as magical as the 1st film"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","9","5 August 2006"," Not so bad for half a movie, but too long
","(watched in Toronto) <br/><br/>I'll start with the bad. By now everybody must have heard that just like the second and the third of the Matrix trilogy and the entire The Lord of the Rings trilogy, ""Pirates"" 2 and 3 are actually one movie, shot as one movie, but divided into two for marketing reasons. There's not much wrong with that, except that ""Pirates"" is not LOTR, by which I mean that it does not really have that much of a story to tell. As I believe in goodness in human nature, I'd say that the movie makers padded this second installment to a 150 minute affair to give the audience its money's worth. As a result, we have an entire sequence of the ""cannibal"" island adventure which is entirely unnecessary. Oh yes, it's fun, to a certain degree. But if I want to watch Roadrunner, I'll WATCH ROADRUNNER. Johnny Depp is funny running around with a pole sticking out of his back but to think that this is what he does best is an immense insult to this enormously talented actor.<br/><br/>Let me now turn to the good. After the unduly long setup and padding which fowl up the pace, the last hour is really quite good. This is when the various threads are tied together, starting in the half-hour with a whole bunch of people (in five different groups) chasing a chest and a key. Sheer good fun, in more ways than one.<br/><br/>The visuals are absolutely the best, bar none. The haunting image of ""The Flying Dutchman"" would make the ghost ship in ""Rhyme of the Ancient Mariner"" look like Disney's Magic Castle. Its captain Davy Jones, literally with a squid for a face and still (though barely recognizable) as Bill Nighy (certainly less so than in ""Underworld""), will make you an undying lover of monster from this day on. And its crew, fruit of creative imagination and state-of-the-art makeup technology, will give you sweet dreams for days to come. As to the GCI, despite it's becoming so commonplace and even tedious these days, what ""Pirates 2"" offers is still something to marvel at.<br/><br/>I will not go into the huge cast, of which even all the supporting stars have their impressive credentials. As I said, this is only half a movie, and you can bet your bottom dollar that you'll come back for number 3. What constitutes your cliffhanger is a personal thing  where is the heart, how Jack Sparrow escape Kraken (of course he is sure to), can Will Turner save father, what will Barbossa cook up this time, etc etc. To me, it will be how Elizabeth and Jack will hit it off, after the tantalizing allusion to their mutual feelings. The rest of movie, no matter how entertaining, is frivolous. It is this relationship that has some substance, intentional or not, and even hints to allegory."

Where the first Pirates of the Caribbean film was, IMO, bland and too full of Jacks strange ticks and a lot of little things that just didn't work this one is alive with a multitude of good effects, odd happenings, great characters, funny bits and a lot more good bits that add up together really well.<br/><br/>It picks up where the first one ended, at least I think it does - I can't remember the first one very well anymore, as I really didn't like it all that much. But after seeing the trailers for this one I thought that this one had a lot of potential to be better than the first one. So I just had to go out and watch this one.<br/><br/>So. What is it about? Well. Davy Jones wants Jack to pay of his debt. So Jones goes hunting for Jack. And Jack goes avoiding him and tries, in his own evil way, to avoid him and find a way to get out of his arms forever. And all that, in that setting of beauty, fun and pirate laughter.<br/><br/>Good stuff. Several factors better than the first one.

","Within 15 minutes of its beginning, it became obvious to me that this movie is nothing more than a cheap ploy to make an easy buck by riding on the success of the first movie. They managed to bring back all of the actors from the original movie, using the same costumes, ships, jokes and just about everything else. They just left one thing out, a decent plot. What a bore! First of all it was too complicated and overloaded with many weird twists and turns, using excessive special effects, especially that huge octopus that kept coming back to destroy ships and crush people. Second, it was far too long (it could've been edited in half), as if the director was trying give us value through quantity, even if it annoyed the hell out of us. Third, it was not well acted at all. I'm not sure which was worse, the writing, acting or the directing.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems with this movie is its plot. It didn't flow smoothly at all and included far too many unrelated scenes that were designed to impress us with some boring special effects. There was no fluidity to the story and the action scenes were too many, too violent, too gross and too superficial. There was no character development at all. Everyone in the movie seems to be doing whatever they wanted, almost like improvising, with very little supervision/directing. They were repeating their performance from the first movie and doing bits and pieces here and there and everywhere with not much sense or purpose. Even Johnny Depp's character's was somewhat dull and stale with no clear definition to it. Kiera Knightley's acting was over-dramatized and often strange that didn't fit her character at all. Her performance was pathetic with many foolish displays and no consistency at all. One minute she was the sweet helpless woman in love with a man, another minute she's disguised as a man on a ship doing weird things for no particular reason, another minute she's a highly competent fighter, then she is a sexy deceptive woman seducing and romancing Depp, then she sacrifices him, then minutes later she wants to bring him back because she felt guilty and on and on .<br/><br/>The movie ended without any resolution at all, leaving us very frustrated. Just like they do in cheap TV soap operas, they wanted to leave us curious enough about the conclusion in order to make sure that we come back for the third sequel. What a cheap trick to make a buck. Needless to say I wouldn't waste my good money, or time, to see any more sequels. There was nothing original about this movie. I always liked Depp, but he appears to have sold out. He and the rest of the cast should be ashamed of themselves for being part of such a worthless scam."

Kira Knightly's acting was terrible, just terrible. The sword fights were poorly edited and conseqently were not exciting, but just boring. At one point they shoot barrels of gunpowder and rum, and they make this giant explosion that is just stupid. Oh yeah, also, the movie just stops!

","This is the first time that I have written a review for a film, but after watching this one, I really felt I should. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest falls into the usual pitfalls of sequels. It forgets about character development and having a plot that sticks together (there isn't one except for the fact that everyone wants to get their hands on the chest). Instead (in a typical Hollywood fashion) the director thinks that enough special effects will bedazzle the audience. Johnny Depp wasn't funny, both Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom's acting was weak to say the least, and the virtually non-existent story line was very predictable. If you want to watch two hours of sword fighting with dead seamen from the deep, then this is the film for you. Otherwise if you are over 22 years old and have a brain, then I am sure there are plenty of more interesting things you can do with the time."

We get our heroes from the last flick set up very quickly and believably, and given new problems to resolve.

This is done with boring, unspirited acting for the most part, though Ms Knightly did have one terrific scene. Still, perhaps this muddle was due to the darker concept of this film.<br/><br/>But add to that the re-introduction of minor characters from the first film - and in such a thoughtless manor - just because they provided comic relief before, and the idea that the semi-eternal creatures need to take naps, or that anyone would really have been able to pull the net with the barrels while the whole ship is under attack in that frantic manner... I mean, what a hash! Parents will also have difficulty explaining to their children why certain pirates are mercurially helpful one moment then bloodthirsty (is that hyphenated?) the next.

If you want to see a smooth storyline in a movie that has a point, this movie probably isn't for you.<br/><br/>Although, harshness aside, we'll have to wait until the third movie is released before I can pass final judgement on the series overall.<br/><br/>Oh and make sure you sit through the credits to see the Mr. Depps Assistant, and the Payroll accountant. But most importantly, the final scene of the movie :p"
"sparkster24","9","5","9","15 July 2006"," Sea thriller - with so many other narratives in the background
","I went to see this film wondering whether this was going to be yet another cheap Hollywood rip-off movie, fortunately, this was not the case. Johnny Depp, in my opinion, will soon be considered the greatest actor to have ever lived and in his greatest role as the camp Captain Jack Sparrow he didn't let us down. The narrative was brilliant, the graphics were fantastic and I would advise that everyone sees it  the film seems to appeal to all ages. The only disappointment was the inclusion of Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom whose soporific acting continued, something which seems to coincide with the whole tradition of being Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. I heard it said that Keira Knightley demanded that she was in a fight scene; I'm surprised the director gave way to her - it seemed rather out of character.<br/><br/>Apart from the minor hic-up of two very poor actors, the film was brilliant and the cold Bill Nighy, starring as Davey Jones, was a sensation in his own right. It has many story lines overlapping and I'm sure everyone can at least relate or enjoy one of them. So far this year, for me, this is the must-see movie! n.b. There are quite a lot of references to the original film so for maximum pleasure refer to the previous episodic before watching this one. However, this film is still very good if you haven't seen the first one."

","When I first read the critics' reviews of this film, I expected the critics to be wrong. I expected this movie to be awesome. But the critics, in some way, were actually right. I liked and didn't like this movie. The music and effects were absolutely brilliant. Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley were outstanding in their roles. The action left me on the edge of my seat and wanting more. Hans Zimmer, who did the score, definitely deserves an Oscar nomination for this film, as does Johnny Depp. However, the movie was too long. There wasn't as much story as there was in the first movie. There were too many monsters in the action scenes. Overall, this movie was not as good and addicting as the first. On the contrary, there is a twist at the end of this movie that will definitely shock you. You will want to see the third movie, which I think will be much better than this one. Overall, Dead Man's Chest is a satisfactory sequel to a beloved classic!"
"bantacd","5","5","9","14 July 2006"," So so, yo ho ho
","From the school of bigger is better film making this sequel is full of memorable moments but doesn't quite go anywhere.<br/><br/>The first film was to me at least an unexpected joy. Most of the joy came from the mix of stock pirate stuff, a great mechanical story that hit the right buttons and a nice turn by Depp. Depp inevitably doesn't seem so fresh this time, and the thin story lumbered all over the place. The redeeming feature, almost, was Naomie Harris in two pivotal scenes. She injected her character with the sort of energy Depp did his in the first. I hope she has much more screen time in the next film.<br/><br/>These type of event movies can be so invigorating when done well, if this one was tightened a little it could have been great instead of seeming like a hastily contrived merchandise shifter."
"redbird06","3","5","9","14 July 2006"," Acting is OK, costumes superb...plot is tedious
","Dead man's chest does showcase amazing special effects, and it is true the costumes are amazing.<br/><br/>However, the plot is tedious and predictable and trite. It reminded me more of a Disney kids movie that comes out every ten years with new characters...It's just the same old song, and let me tell you, there is no different meaning.<br/><br/>I sat through the entire middle of the movie knowing EXACTLY what was going to happen in the last 10 minutes of the movie, and let me tell you, that is not fun, especially when the character dynamics and psychology do not make sense.<br/><br/>Throughout the entire movie, Depp plays Sparrow as the most self-centered and self absorbed pirate ever...which would have been great, pirates are selfish and evil, even lovable rogues. For example, Sparrow sells out Bloom's character to save himself, and then makes a deal to trade the lives of 99 other innocent and not-so-innocent people in return for his own.<br/><br/>His actions directly or indirectly led to the deaths of over 100 characters.<br/><br/>He tries to steal Knightly's character from Bloom's character...all around, he's a bad guy.<br/><br/>SPOILER AHEAD!!! But at the end of the movie, for no reason at all, Sparrow decides to help the last remaining people escape from the Kraken (totally out of character for Sparrow). In return, Knightly's character chains him to the ship to be eaten by the Kraken by tricking him into kissing her (which Bloom's character sees). Still, everyone feels bad for the demise of this vile character who has risked their lives for his personal gain, and when a witch says they can save him (how? He was shredded and eaten!) all agree to mount a rescue operation (this will be the next movie)that will result in the death of the remainder of the U.S.S. Black Pearl's expendable crewmen."

","What was comedic and cute in the first movie has become tedious parody in the second. While the technical effects were good, the story must have been actually written by the Hollywood executives who initially rejected the first movie. I was bored beyond belief.<br/><br/>The only reason that the actors prostituted themselves for this must have been an awful lot of money for the three picture deal. While they appeared to try to give some character to the parts, the only one I felt was really doing more than going through the motions was Naomi Harris.<br/><br/>I just hope that they can get decent roles in the future, and this people forgive them this piece of crap."

","***1/2 Johnny Deep, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy, Jack Davenport, Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook. Directed by Gore Verbinski<br/><br/>The sequel to 2003's summer smash hit ""Pirates: Curse of the Black Pearl"" comes the new and near more entertaining summer blockbuster for 2006. I've gotten to see a lot of so-called ""extravaganzas"" like ""Poseidon"", ""Da Vinci Code"" and ""Superman Returns"" and I am pleased to say ""Dead Man's Chest"" does not disappoint in it's efforts. Instead each scene is well crafted by original director Verbinski (Showcasing some talent this time around in his directing) to make it by far the most entertaining movie I've seen all year.<br/><br/>Cunning Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp, savvy?) is being hunted down by the legendary ""locker"" owner Davy Jones (Nighy, respectfully) to repay his debt. While a Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Bloom) get prepared for there wedding until forced to find Jack and retrieve a valuable compass. Also joining the crew are the two ex- immortal Pirates from the Black Pearl (Arenberg and Crook). And Crook gets the laughs with his eye popping in and out at times<br/><br/>""Pirates"" although with a run time of 2 hours and a handful of minutes does not bore with a tiresome story line. Instead 90 percent of the run time is filled with action both on land and water. Kudos to the special effects team who did a great job with Davy's water logged ship and adding those little sea shells you find on the rocks. A dazzling display of directing and an all out beautiful film with great CGI. Certainly on the years MUST LIST, I for one savvy"
"Pasafist","5","5","9","8 July 2006"," It's big, loud, and lacks subtlety, and charm. A Hollywood blockbuster for sure.
","When one attempts to create a list of the worst hack directors in Hollywood, Gore Verbinski, is in the top 3 for me (right behind Bret Ratner and Michael Bay). These men have made millions in Hollywood peddling half-hearted, and over bloated popcorn flicks for years, and have gotten very good at it. So, when the receipts start to pour in for PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST, Gore Verbinski will probably laugh all the way to the bank. I ask why? Why do we as humans keep going to see movie like this? Why does the entire audience hoop, holler, and cheer? And why can't I have the fun everybody else seems to be having? DEAD MAN'S Chest begins on the wedding day of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. Their nuptials are ruined when they are taken into custody for the events of the original film. Will is guaranteed freedom and release for himself and his bride but only if he will retrieve a compass from Jack Sparrow, and deliver it to the evil East Indian Trading Company. This sets off a series of events that bring Will, Elizabeth, and Captian Jack Sparrow face to face with the mysterious Davey Jones and the motley crew of the Flying Dutchman. Will there be Action? Will there be Swashbuckling Adventure? Will Johnny Depp act like a Drag Queen on a harbor cruise? Of course.<br/><br/>I can easily sum up this film in one word: adequate. It got a lot of nicely paced action sequences, some silly comedy, and there is just the right amount of peril and suspense hiding around the corner. You won't have a bad time, if you must run out and see this movie, the theater is the place. But if you were expecting a deeper more fulfilling visit with the characters of the first film, or at least a better more fleshed out story, you'll be sadly disappointed. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is just more of the same.<br/><br/>All the characters show up say their lines, and seem to be having a good time. But there's nothing else there. Orlando Bloom is the hero, Keira Knightly is the Damsel with bite, and Johnny Depp is Johnny Depp pretending to be Keith Richards as a pirate. The screenplay does nothing to let us into their lives, their motivations serve the script only, and while they don't do a bad job, the script doesn't really ask them too. This is a point A to point B kind of a movie, every motivation serves the screenplay, not the story.<br/><br/>As for the action scenes. There are two worth mentioning and save the film from being utterly boring. The first is an elaborate chase scene on an island with swinging cages, angry natives, and Jack Sparrow tied to a giant bamboo pole. The other scene involves a waterwheel and a ton of swashbuckling. This scene comes late enough into the movie that it almost saves the entire picture. The last fifteen minutes are a breeze because that scene really creates a lot of momentum.<br/><br/>Director Verbinski show again that he can take pretty pictures, and stage large special effects sequences. But very little of it is groundbreaking or worth writing home about. He doesn't up the ante at all. Great sequels ask us to take the next step, to challenge what came before, or a least given the characters more depth and freshness. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is simply a two and half hour rehash of the original PIRATES film, with a less interesting villain and some anti-capitalist nonsense thrown in.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from a running time that is just unacceptable. Like the first PIRATES film, DEAD MAN'S CHEST is a 90 minute movie stretched over two and a half hours. So much happens in this film, and so much of it is inconsequential to the plot. Because the plot in and of itself lacks any meat. This film is the middle of a planned trilogy, and since it has very few surprises, character depth, and plot revelations that I just know the third installment will be very, very lackluster.<br/><br/>I understand that people like these kind of movies. I don't because I know that there are so many talented people out there with awesome stories to tell, and character to create. DEAD MAN'S CHEST is just a rehash of the same thing. It's big, loud, and lacks subtlety, and charm. A Hollywood blockbuster for sure. It's adequate, people will like it, but this is not a great film."
"pezgirlie","5","5","9","8 July 2006"," Not impressed
","There are two big critiques I have of this movie: 1) Davey Jones boat and crew looked like one big green and gray blob. It was virtually impossible to distinguish crew members from one another and from the background when they were aboard the ship. Yes, the ocean is full of kelp and barnacles, but not everything is dark green and gray - not even in the depths. Give it some color and make things distinguishable! I rue the day this gets released on DVD...things will be even less distinct.<br/><br/>2) I hope all movie studios read this comment: If you're going to make an action movie - let the audience be able to see the action! I get so irritated by movies that cram fifty different action shots into 5 seconds, but you can't tell what happened in ANY of the shots. Slow it down, people! Give the movie some depth. I can't even tell you what happened in half of this movie because all I saw were flickers of things flying across the screen. What was flying or what happened to it, I couldn't tell you.<br/><br/>One last wish I have is that modern movies would stop showing people vomit. It's just disgusting, uncalled for, and I don't understand the modern fascination with showing it. You never saw it in old movies, and nowadays you can't escape it. It's ridiculous."

","I loved the first movie-it was the highlight of my summer. So naturally I was really excited about this one. More Jack, Will, and Elizabeth-what could be bad? As it were, a lot.<br/><br/>Negatives: The beginning is confusing-they jump from location to location and I would almost say that the part with the island where Jack is a god could have been deleted. Tia Dalma and most of Davy Jones' crew were hard to understand <br/><br/>Positives: The last 40 or so minutes (once they arrive on the island with Davy Jones' chest) are great. They fit in much better with the tone of the first movie-pure fun. But there are about 100 minutes to sit through before we reach that point. I also loved seeing Barbossa at the end.<br/><br/>Bottom-line: I saw another review that compared this movie to The Empire Strikes Back but I think it's more like Temple of Doom: not nearly as good as the first but hopefully it will end up being the weakest of the trilogy."

Barbossa!"" and then it ends, and i turned to my friends and said, ""Well the movie was kind of a let down, except for the last 30 seconds.""but don't get me wrong, i liked this movie a lot, out of the context of the first.if you look at this movie without looking at the first, its so good, but when you think of the second, its just, ""Oh Dead Man's Chest is a sequel to Curse of the Black Pearl?""the problems with the movie for me are:over used jokes, they just repeated jokes they did in the first and at first it was kinda cute, but then it just got annoying;long running time, the whole movie just seemed to drag and drag and the whole scene with the cannibals?yeah, that could been cut, it had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever;Johnny Depp's forced role.go ahead be angry with me for this, but it has to be said, Johnny Depp's role was forced, he tried to hard to recreate the magic of Captain Jack Sparrow.i was thinking, ""No, Johnny don't try so hard. Tone it down, don't play it up."";the jokes they did have?well there were a few good ones, but nothing laugh out loud funny, just things you would chuckle at, or smile over. the redeeming quality's?well the music for one.Hans Zimmer, the composer, reused a lot, but thats great, the music makes this movie good.and the general movie was great to look at. there were times i wanted to clothes my eyes, until they started talking, but then i thought, ""But I'll miss all this great cinematography!""and another good point.anything and everything with Bill Nighy.the best actor in this whole movie.with out question Bill Nighy.my absolute favorite.everything with Davy Jones I loved.i could tell it was Bill Nighy under all the CG, it was great how well he was put together, how Bill Nighy's great characteristics still came out of the CG. i went into this movie hoping for a sort of Indiana Jones plot.go on a grand adventure, save whoever needs save, resolve the plot, and boom over, ready for the new adventure in the next movie that has nothing to do with this one.but i accepted that it decided to go with a lord of the rings approach, thats still good.as in not resolve anything, leave with a huge cliffhanger(Geoffrey Rush's cameo=brilliant), making people wanting more.now we have to wait another year, and of course we will all go and see it.evil movie producers! final thoughts.all in all a good movie, go see it its worth it.but the first is so so so so much better, its not funny.i am giving this movie a 7/10 for great music(love the Davy Jones theme),great actor in Bill Nighy,great visuals, and just because it is Pirates of the Caribbean.thats right it gets points just because it was the sequel to my favorite movie.well go ahead yell at me, i am prepared.but you must remember, I LIKED IT!"

I'm somewhat at a loss to understand why this sequel has evoked a nearly opposite reaction.<br/><br/>Except to say- the jokes both visual and verbal seemed somehow patronizing and ill -timed. The ingredients and timbre of the 1st film with it's blend of one liners, humor and expected pirate myths- sailing in a ship built out of salvaged parts of a host of films from several genres and vintages has lost it's compass here. If it is the same formula- then I have no explanation for why I liked the 1st film to begin with, or why it worked magic at the box office. It may well be that those who did not like the original, may like this one very well. It is also likely that fans of the Pirates of the Caribbean; Curse of the Black Pearl may well embrace this one as well- for all the reasons I find it forced, and way off course They may find it entertaining. I also think it gave in to some common ""rules"" and lazy ones at that. ( It was how they broke all the rules in Curse of the Black Pearl that made it so fresh and charming) Dead Mans Chest is doing the fashionable- kiss the sexy pirate- divide the lovers with the lowest common denominator, and roll so much video -game action that no has time to think if any of it is actually truly enjoyable storytelling."

The dread pirate Depp, aka Captain Jack Sparrow was in as good a form as ever, and did not disappoint. Appearances of characters we knew from the first film gave the story a familiarity and continuity I hadn't anticipated, and yet the film stands well on its own with lots of characters that have ""history"" with Jack Sparrow - that guy sure gets around! Knightly and Bloom both turned in stronger performances this time around, which was a pleasant surprise. This film is darker than the first, but there are still plenty of comic moments to provide relief, and sufficient complexities to the characters to give depth where you might expect a caricature."

Captain Jack was not amazing, heck the only reason i finished the movie was because of the girl. So get this the entire movie was revolved around finding Davey Jones's heart. I know you are thinking what the heck, I was to. So anyways about 2 hours and 15 minutes into the movie they find the heart fight over it and lose it. In the end they have know heart.

I don't have the - Oh My God, I have to see that again - feeling that some films give me.<br/><br/>In general I enjoyed it but I just feel that everything was taken to the point where it was working and then pushed to see if it could get any better.

Every time he was on screen I felt myself moving towards the edge of my seat, wanting to see what he would do next. This time he juggles with the old good Vs bad, light Vs dark storyline and makes decisions that I feel he as a character would never make. I felt let down by him. Also his little quips that made him so lovable in the original began to get on my nerves ever so slightly.<br/><br/>As I said the Actors did a great job, Bloom and Keira as usual are very watchable. However they gave me no reason to think they even liked each other let alone are ready to wed! ...<br/><br/>All in all the movie is watchable and I will go and see the next one just to see what happens.

The first one rocked... the second one was OK, but wasn't meant to stand alone. I am not a fan of movies that obviously are set ups for another movie. Plus this movie is 2 1/2 hours long.

","Back in the company of Captain Jack Sparrow, (Johnny Depp) we are again taken on an escapade of the melancholy and mischievous sort. This time Jack is on a search for the Dead Man's Chest. For once he possesses it he will be able to control the one who he owes a debt to. The ruler of the sea, Davy Jones. (Bill Nighy) But what would this quest be without the assistance of his fellow chum Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his bride-to-be Elizabeth Swann? (Keira Knightly) They too are inevitably drug into this whirlwind of non-stop ""comedy"" and various mishaps. All the while is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) also yearning to get the chest as well so he can single-handedly rid the seas of pirates everywhere.<br/><br/>Usually sequels don't surpass the greatness and originality their predecessors establish. 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' doesn't fail to follow suit. From the trailers it appears to be an exciting thrill ride loaded with tons of merriment. But in reality its a two hour and thirty five minute foreseeable film filled with humdrum antics and sleep inducing banter.<br/><br/>The first 'Pirates' was absolutely one hundred percent far more delightful. Before it, a character with humor and essence such as Captain Jack Sparrow hadn't been seen in cinema. A once amusing and engaging Jack is now just plain annoying. Here in 'Dead Man's Chest' his foolhardy, joker demeanor only halts the story as it attempts to progress. In addition, average acting and direction are dishearteningly unveiled. The only pleasing aspects presented are the outstanding visuals and devilishly good villain Davy Jones. I'm afraid neither of these ingredients are able to save this mess of a film from sinking though.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, 'Dead Man's Chest' is nothing more than a film built on hype and in the end has no real substance. ""I think the second movie is strong and clever and has a lot going on"", said director Gore Verbinski in an October interview last year when speaking about 'Pirates'. Apparently this version of the film didn't make the final cut. Even so, 'Dead Man's Chest' will without a doubt continue to dominate at the movies and make other summer releases walk the plank at the box office. I don't think even Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx's big screen adaptation of 'Miami Vice' will be able to decimate it when released this Friday. I guess I can give Verbinski some credit though. It's pretty amazing to see a film with video-game logic that's created from zip do so tremendous."

The nuptials are interrupted by Cutter Beckett (Tom Hollander), representing the East India Trading Company, who is interested in Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and is using Will and Elizabeth to reach his goals. He strikes a deal with Will: Bring him Jack and he and Elizabeth will be let go. Jack also has problems of his own: he is being chased by the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, along with some very impressive CGI), who has survived death by becoming a combo of sea beings, to pay up a dept he owes Jones: his soul. Jack is, needless to say, interested in avoiding this, so he goes in search of a relic that will give him the drop on Jones, and Will comes along for the ride, with the plan to return to save Elizabeth.<br/><br/>So, let's start with the good stuff: Dead Man's Chest is gorgeous to look at, beautifully photographed by Dariusz Wolski, with equally impressive production design by Rick Heinrichs. Also, the visual effects that realize Davy Jones and the crew of the Flying Dutchman, his ship, is beyond superb. The crew are realized as amalgams of creatures of the deep, and their integration with the live action photography is excellent, worthy of an Academy Award nomination at the very least. And Johnny Depp is once again fairly entertaining as Jack Sparrow, although not quite as much as the first installment.<br/><br/>All that leaves plenty of room for the bad stuff. If Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was overlong, then Dead Man's Chest is nearly unending. The film clocks in a two and half hours, and that is a minimum of an hour too long. The film moves at an absolute crawl, with enough extraneous material to fill two other movies. It takes forever to actually get going and the first hour is almost completely unnecessary setup, with lots of side trips off the main plot: Jack and crew ending up on an island where he is worshipped as a god and the crew are all food for the cannibalistic natives; Elizabeth trying to catch up to Will and Jack by hitching a ride on another ship and befuddling the crew; the Black Pearl recruiting a crew to help them out and meeting up with an old adversary, etc., etc. Most of this stuff just slows down the narrative and pads the film's running length without adding anything. It's more than an hour into the film before the real villains show up and the story finally gets going.<br/><br/>What doesn't help is that the screenplay is almost completely unable to really explain anything that is going on. Beckett wants Jack for an object he possesses, and Davy Jones wants to keep . . . something safe. The film actually explains what these characters are after, but the explanations do nothing, because I still don't know what anyone is really after in this film. Everything in Dead Man's Chest is half-explained, and I guess the fact that this is part of a two film cycle (with another sequel to follow) is supposed to give some reason as to why full information is not given out, but it just leaves audiences head's scratching. When you sit through a two and a half hour movie and still don't really understand any of the character's motivations for doing anything, it can prove to be a letdown.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest also suffers from relatively non-existent character development. Will and Elizabeth seem to have used up any depth to their characters in the first film, because they are both relative ciphers here. Their love affair has little or no passion, you don't really feel any draw to either of them, and their plight is rather uninvolving. Jack Sparrow is fun to watch at times, but his rather unbending ""me for myself"" attitude makes it difficult to latch onto him as a hero. Bill Nighy turns in a decent performance as Davy Jones, and while the effects used to realize him are impressive to say the least, he proves to not be a tremendously imposing villain.<br/><br/>In the never ending sweepstakes to separate the viewer from their cash, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has cooked up a impressive looking spectacle that is hollow to the core and takes forever to get where it is trying to go, and once you arrive, you find that there is nothing special waiting for you."
"bruce-moreorless","6","4","7","18 September 2006"," Okay but way too long
","I wish the moguls at Hollywood could learn that less is often more. Too many blockbuster films of recent years have been ruined by self-indulgent directors going on and on and on until stories become overweight and boring. Think Peter Jackson and King Kong, or, for that matter, any Peter Jackson film.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is another one of these. The elements of a rollicking yarn are there but too many scenes overstay their welcome. The film could have been cut by at least half an hour and it wouldn't have lost a thing. In fact it would have gained.<br/><br/>I suppose we can expect the same in Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End. Personally I hope they try to bring it in in under two hours."

","This film really lived up to the hype surrounding it! I saw the first one and I forgot about the plot completely. Fortunately, this one was very memorable that I am sure I won't forget it. The plot was intense and tightly woven, and there was a nice balance of action and comedy in the film. The viewers laughed out loud so many times on those mischievous moments. The scene with fruits was so hilarious! Johnny Depp's acting was incredible. The facial expression on his face kept on changing, and he obviously thought deeply on what face to pull in each second of the movie. The make up is amazing. Those people on the haunted ship looked so terrible and yet so real! Having a starfish on the face or having corals on the shoulder showed that the costume designers and make up artists really put a huge amount of effort in making those characters real.<br/><br/>The ending was great as well, the finale lasted well over 30 minutes, and it kept me wanting to know more. The fights were well choreographed and also looked comical enough to be entertaining.<br/><br/>This film was fantastic. I can only recommend it!"

","Pirates 2 is a good film that is easily enjoyable no matter what age group the audience consists of.A lot of humour and some gorgeous cinematography with some breath taking visuals.The voodoo woman was a very neat character she was spooky yet enticing and a really intriguing new character.Davy Jones was a pretty cool new character as well not and not only was the cgi masterful the fight scenes were just as fantastic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the fact that everyone had a darker,more selfish side and personally that seems more believable of pirates than the ""noone gets left behind"" attitude in The Curse Of The Black Pearl.Everyone is as greedy as each other and soon enough they accomplish what they set out to get but then fight over who gets it.My only criticism for Pirates 2 is that the action is far too spaced apart and it at times flows at a slower pace than expected.Unfortunately no battle occurred in this film however there is a great little three way sword fight,and some cool monster fighting scenes in there as well.Pirates 2 is overall great fun and contains an ending that is as good as that of The Sixth Sense or Saw."
"Rob_Taylor","9","4","7","6 August 2006"," Starts a little slowly, but builds nicely.
","Sequels rarely live up to the original's ideals and energy, so I wasn't expecting much going into this. I thought my fears would be justified for the first 45 minutes or so seem not to go anywhere quickly. Of course, being made back-to-back with the third film in mind, this movie was always destined to be the ""middle"" chapter. And middle chapters are historically weak in comparison to the start and finish episodes of a trilogy.<br/><br/>However, after the first hour or so of tom-foolery things began to build quite well in terms of scope, foolishness and general action, until the last half hour or so pretty much flew by. In particular, the whole series of scenes from the search on the beach for the chest onwards is just delightfully ridiculous.<br/><br/>Although there didn't seem to be the same level of foolishness on the part of Depp this time out, I think that everyone increases their level of madcap antics leading to him not ""outshining"" everyone else. Of course, he still does, but everyone seems to be hamming it up a lot more this time. Strangely though, that doesn't drag the film down at all. Just gives it more energy.<br/><br/>Overall, a worthy middle episode that, though sluggish to start, finishes with a glorious climax and only leaves you waiting with anticipation for the final chapter.<br/><br/>Easily the most fun movie I've watched so far this year!"
"cchase","9","4","7","5 August 2006"," If You Want MORE, You've GOT IT!!!
","It's pretty much a rule written in stone about sequels: if you want to be as successful with a follow-up as you were with the original, you MUST raise your game. If you had glamour the first time around, it has to be MORE glamorous. The suspense must be MORE suspenseful, the gore gorier, the flash flashier...well, you get the picture.<br/><br/>With the track record of such gems as INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and STAR TREK 2: THE WRATH OF KHAN, I was hoping that the creative crew behind the first PIRATES would bear all of these in mind, and join them in their glorious achievements, instead of coming up with something as downright awful as, say, SPEED 2. I needn't have worried.<br/><br/>The magic is definitely back, and DEAD MAN'S CHEST is probably the best sequel you will see all year. If MORE is what you've been craving, you'll have a full belly before this one is even half-over! <br/><br/>No time is wasted jumping right into where BLACK PEARL left off. A morose Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) thinks she's been left at the altar by fiancée Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), but such is not the case. Soon she, Will and even her father, Gov. Weatherbee Swann (Jonathan Pryce) will all be arrested for aiding and abetting one Capt. Jack Sparrow in Part One. But there's more treachery afoot here than even a pirate could dream up. Certain ""agents"" representing the East India Trading Company want possession of Jack's mystic compass. The compass is the key to finding yet another key...the one that opens up that object of fabled myth, Davy Jones' locker. And anyone who can grab what's inside the locker can ultimately control the Seven Seas.<br/><br/>And that's just going into what THEY want. Jack Sparrow wants the key to the locker to escape a fate far worse than death...an eternity of servitude as one of Jones' crustacean-encrusted crew, on board the hellish ghost ship The Flying Dutchman, to fulfill a debt that Jack never repaid. (BIG surprise.) So yes, MORE story is only the tip of the iceberg here. Bloom and Knightley as the prettiest characters in the cast have much more to do, but they also go through more changes. A lot of their naiveté has gone since their last misadventures with Sparrow, and a lot more will disappear before the movie's end. It's rather refreshing to see that even the ""good guys"" here can have some conflicted moral dilemmas to work through.<br/><br/>And yes, dear Jack. What was shocking before has now become normal, even almost endearing, as this swashbuckling stew of Keith Richards, Pepe le Pew and maybe even a little Prince thrown in for extra flavor, slashes and sashays his way from one predicament to the next with a boozy, blustery bonhomie.<br/><br/>Not to be outdone is Bill Nighy as the fearsome Captain Jones, who projects both melancholy and menace through some of the ookiest CGI layers since Andy Serkis got behind Gollum. You won't see a more frightening or fascinating villain this summer. And new addition Naomie Harris (28 DAYS LATER) as the eerie swamp witch Tia Dalma, sinks her teeth into the pivotal role like it was a seven-course gourmet meal. She HAS to come back for Part Three!<br/><br/>I so want to go over how great each returning cast member and character was, but I'll let you plumb the depths of those surprises and pleasures yourself. Gore Verbinski, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio and Jerry Bruckheimer will be happy to know that their sequel definitely goes into the Hall of Fame with the other heavy hitters, (and that's before you even take into account the dizzying box-office returns.) It does run a little long at over two hours, but for pure entertainment, you won't want to miss this one. And if what you're already getting wasn't enough, wait until you get a gander at the gasp-inducing ending. Not since EMPIRE STRIKES BACK or the first KILL BILL has there been a climax that has you climbing the walls and yelling ""NOOOO! What happens NEXT???"" See ya in about two years, when they answer THAT question..."

","I must say that my expectations were decidedly pretty low when I first went to see this, but that doesn't mean I wasn't shaking with excitement! Knowing full-well that this was the middle chapter of a trilogy, I will admit that I was bracing for a theatrical disaster of epic proportions. Yes...the dreaded sequel to what maybe should have been left as a one-hit-wonder, and a Disney sequel at that! Some part of me definitely was expecting a disappointment, but I was wrong... Oh man was I wrong.<br/><br/>This movie would never have survived had Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer not stuck to their strengths. Namely a group of characters so likable and believable that anyone can relate to them. Not only did they keep these beloved heroes, Jack, Will and Elizabeth, but they delved deeper into them. They have created some of the most renowned Disney characters ever... Don't believe me? Even the bad guys get great responses! Look at the end of the second film! *wink wink* And I hear another certain commodor has a fan base of his very own.<br/><br/>Something great about this sequel is that it's not just the same old characters thrown into some new complicated plot that arises out of no where. It's actually derived from the plot of the first (which was that movies greatest asset) something that surprised me.<br/><br/>Another very addictive aspect of this brilliant sequel was the score... Something that I looked forward to almost as much as the movie itself, and it was just as spectacular as the first! They took the melodies every person on Earth has caught themselves humming, and became even more creative, adding a pipe-organ *WOW* and even more dramatic strings, is that possible!? Between the twisting plot, the juicy promise of a jam-packed third installment, and cliffy ending... This movie is the cinematic equivalent for returning pirates addicts to aztec gold, the curse being that we have to wait a whole year for the finale!"

","Every true Pirate fan should see this movie, but make sure you have enough food. And a crossword. And a knitting project. Or something, because at 150 minutes, this sequel is a time commitment. The characters run through fight/adventure sequence after fight/adventure sequence in a plot that only makes sense if you don't think too hard.<br/><br/>This isn't Hotel Rwanda or Citizen Kane and never wanted to be. But with a predecessor so fresh and funny, having a sequel with definite lulls is a disappointment.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly is underused, chasing after everyone else. Orlando Bloom's Will doesn't bring many surprises, and Johny Depp's Jack is...well...business as usual. Tom Hollander makes for a funny villain, especially after his turn as Mr. Collins in Pride & Prejudice...I kept waiting for him to complement someone on the excellent boiled potatoes. The rest of the supportive cast is fine but there are so many that I wonder if the third installment should be titled ""Prirates of the Caribbean: Ocean's 13"".<br/><br/>After 115 minutes I wondered if this film would ever end, or if I would find myself watching Jack Sparrow twirl across the high seas for the rest of my life. And then I couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if Elizabeth had just married Norington in the first place. He had a good job, was decent looking (he's more attractive sans wig in this installment), and her dad liked him. Maybe then she wouldn't have found herself chased by the undead, their barnacled counterparts, and pirates in eyeliner."

I'm not going to talk about the plot? story? series of not so wonderfully edited film footage.<br/><br/>It would not be so unfortunate if this were just another computer game adaptation, or a mindless teen flick. But this is the second part of a gem of a film.<br/><br/>On viewing the first five minutes I was getting warning signs. I think it was when Jack Sparrow gave the map of the key to his chief mate that I suddenly had very real doubts.<br/><br/>The humour .. It was not just me, because I thought it might be. But the audience around me remained quite quiet during most of the film. There was the occasional titter, but nothing that would amount to full blown laughter. Why? Perhaps the writer might be able to justify this? Now I look at it, the whole film seems to be chopped up footage that does not really give us anything important save that Davey Jones is coming after Jack and there is a Kracken that can destroy ships and . .ok I am struggling here. Oh yes, they need to find the key that opens the chest containing Davey Jones's heart.<br/><br/>OK, now we have identified with that let's sit back and watch a mostly un amusing romp with a script that seems to give the characters less dignity.<br/><br/>The special effects and the makeup effects are some of the best I have seen to date. But something is terribly wrong . .because by the time I see the Kracken tearing the ship apart and looking with some considerable approval at the head mask of Davey Jones I have lost interest in anything else that I was not sure I was following correctly anyway. <br/><br/>Fundimentally I can say that this film seems to have no heart. No special touch of it's predecessor that hooked you warmly and with good family humour.<br/><br/>This film was not written very well nor was it directed with any great innovation. It's a real shame because this was one of the few films I cared about this year.<br/><br/>Giving it a five is generous because I am a faithful fan, Bill Nighty as Davey Jones stealing the show and stopping it from becoming a real abominable mess. <br/><br/>The third installment really needs to be better to simply stop this trilogy from falling into unredeemable mediocrity."

","Wellll...aside from trying to help me catch up on my sleep three or four times, the second installment to the Pirate's franchise didn't have much to offer. Johnny Depp was there, of course, and just as amusing as in the first, but without much heart. There were a few great scenes full of situation comedy that about had me in stitches...but they were few and far between. What did they fall between? A loose, empty-aired plot that wasn't near as interesting as the first...and just seemed like an excuse to have the characters, especially the CGI spectacles, on the screen. The movie did manage to make me laugh though, Johnny Depp was still great, and I'm sure some awards for make-up/costume design will be in order. So, overall, I'd rate it at about a 6/10."

","As a real life pirate, I find that this movie does not do enough to promote the cool crime of piracy. At no point did Jack Sparrow illegally download his movie on the internet. this I find to be very inaccurate. Avril Levigne is the voice of our generation, Orlando Bloom is not. Wasn't he that guy in the Lord of the Rings movie? Wasn't he also Tom Hanks' homosexual lover in You Got Mail? Or was that Ryan Meg? I don't know This movie wasn't too bad, I mean, I was bored throughout the whole thing, did not really find any part of the movie that good, was baffled by the editing choices in leaving a movie that runs well past what should be a normal running time, and found myself getting tired of Jack Sparrow's schtick.

","My best friend had told me that this movie was very entertaining, and his word was proved well after I finished from watching it.<br/><br/>It was all about another adventure of the crazy-but-lovable trio, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightley), and this time they were facing someone (or something) far more dangerous than Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush). It was none other than Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) who wanted Jack's soul as payment for his debt.<br/><br/>I must say this movie totally blew me off with laughter and excitement. It was so silly in a fun way and made 2.5-hours worth watching until I didn't realize it ended. Depp's acting was superb and I don't think other actors could replace him. It does looks like Depp and Sparrow is one person all this time. Another actor that surprised me was Bill Nighy who played as Davy Jones. Behind his tentacles you can still saw his crazy acting and that was amazing.<br/><br/>Although the movie was good and entertaining, it took awhile for me at the beginning of the movie to make the connection between the first one (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl  2003) with this one. I have to admit that I forgot some details from the 1st Pirates and yet I need to focus on details in the 2nd Pirates. It was minor though and your memory could easily got refreshed as the movie flows. As for the story, the 1st Pirates had richer story than the sequel, but the sequel had more fun and entertaining scenes, or I would rather say silly and entertaining, which it will make you excited. Anyways, this movie will surely surprised you, especially at the end.<br/><br/>In summary, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was one of the great summer movies that worth watching. You may watch the 1st one before the sequel to enjoy this movie better, but that's not a must. Oh, I just want to give you a hint (not a spoiler). If you want, please stay on your seat until the end credit title finished. You will see a scene there, which was made for another laugh only, similar to what they have in Cars."

Our children really do not need this type of exposure; possibly I am mistaken, but it appears that II was more murderous than I.<br/><br/>The movie is very long...too long!

","Everyone is saying what a great movie this was. Visually, yes. Very appealing. Also very exciting. But, that ignores the fact that the movie made no sense and had no plot. This was a blatant attempt at cashing in on a good movie. Example - Captain Barbosa DIED at the end of the last movie! What is he doing back? I'll tell you, lining the pockets of Disney executives! This movie was nothing but old jokes re-hashed to get children to drag their parents to the theaters a dozen times. Personally, for $8 a ticket I think they could have written a new movie. Or at least a coherent one, nothing made sense. Like why are people floating around in the middle of the ocean in a row boat anyway? And what can you do with Davy Jones's heart? (Apparently you then own the whole ocean!) Also, why would captain Jack trade 13 years as a pirate captain for 100 years on Davey Jones's ship followed by death? And why would you wait 13 years to try and kill him off? This was one of the dumbest movies I have watched all season. Also most of the fights were too long, to the point of being boring. Also the beginning doesn't make any sense, why would a bride sit in the rain (along with all that stuff, like we are supposed to believe that musician in the 1700's left sheet music in the rain) before Will was even arrested?"

","The intrigue, mystery, and character development of the first movie was no where to be found in this movie. Dialog or scenes that were funny the first time around were not funny a second time. I wanted to enjoy and tried hard, but could not. It was confusing, complicated, hard to follow, and took a long time to set the stage before the story really got started. It had a corny element, an almost Harry Potter magic (I like Harry Potter, but not in this movie), and had some lame attempts at humor. Captain Sparrow's humor was over used. He was much more funny in the first movie - with just the right dose. It has a few redeeming moments and a few surprises, which are good. It was way too long. I found myself sitting there wondering when a long and repetitive scene would end. The ending is a set up for part 3, which is OK."

","I was one of the die hard fans that attended the midnight showing of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest , early on Friday morning and had absolutely no problems staying awake. It's a total shot of adrenaline.<br/><br/>They've provided stellar special effects, acting, and all around entertainment equally for men and women and have done a wonderful job building for the next one to be released in 2007 (thank goodness we knew that before seeing the movie, because I carefully paid attention to all the clues there might be hidden in this one which were building for the next one). Yes, they have done everything in this movie with something for everyone. They even sophisticatedly poked fun at the first Pirates Black Pearle in a few places.<br/><br/>A couple of days later, I watched a History Channel presentation of ""True Caribbean Pirates"" which profiled some of the better known historical Caribbean/African/Etc. pirates of the era and have an even higher regard for the research and writing that Ted and Terry have done for Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's characters have matured quite a bit in this movie and they command their own piece of it. Their characters face all kinds of ""real"" obstacles and are still dancing around each other in a wonderfully optimistic way.<br/><br/>What can I say about Jack Sparrow, uhhh I mean CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow; he is a brilliant mixture of daring, brave, chicken, sexy, careful, ohhh I could go on and on.

","I thought the movie was alright but not as good as I expected. I loved the first one and this didn't quite live up to its high standards, as with most sequels. I found that it dragged on too much and the ending was also a bit of a let down. I understand that they wanted to leave people in suspense and looking forward to the third one but i think they could have done it differently. The ending left me feeling disappointed and incomplete. <br/><br/>However, apart from these small things I thought it was still pretty good. It had the same good humor that fans one the first one loved and of course everyone's favorite character, Captain Jack sparrow remained his hilariously charming self. I'm not a great fan of Will though as I find him too heroic and trusting. No one is perfect. I also thought the bringing back of some of the previous characters from the first movie was a bit unnecessary as they sometimes seem out of place and to be grasping a bit to have it similar to the first."
"Nina_Myers_24","5","4","7","9 July 2006"," Descnet for a sequel, but definitely not as good as the original.
","For a sequel, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is not bad. However, it definitely does not live up to the original.<br/><br/>1. Captain Jack was way more fun, witty, and charming in the first movie. Somehow, the spirit of Jack seems to have left for the second one. Johnny's heart just doesn't feel like it's in the role.<br/><br/>2. Captain Jack was a much nicer guy in the first movie. I mean, he was somewhat of a double-agent, but in this movie he almost feels malicious. Also, any of his deep moments from the first movie, like when he talked to Elizabeth on the island about what a ship is, do not reappear in the sequel.<br/><br/>3. The music wasn't as good the second time around. I mean, it was okay, but it's just that the music in Black Pearl was so astonishing, that DMC's music paled by comparison. DMC used some of the songs from the original during the action parts of the movie, but other than that, there really was very little music of any kind. In the first movie, the music was used really well to set the mood, but not in the sequel.<br/><br/>4. The sword fights were much better in Black Pearl than in DMC. In Black Pearl they were way more real; they were even in time with the music! But in DMC the sword fights (correction, sword fight) just feel ridiculous and silly.<br/><br/>5. A movie needs a coherent plot! Black Pearl definitely had one. DMC definitely did not. I mean, sure, there were a lot of various interesting subplots, but it was hard to see how they all worked together to form a single story.<br/><br/>6. Barbossa was a much better villain than Davey Jones. Some people would disagree with me on this, but I like a villain who we can try to understand, rather than a over-sized shrimp who is nothing more than a meanie. With Barbossa, while he was mean, he was doing it because he had the simple desire to be able to feel and taste again. Let's not forget that Geoffery Rush is an amazing actor; he was definitely missed in the second film (except for his two seconds at the end). I also thought it was more realistic and historically accurate to have Pirates fighting Pirates rather than Pirates fighting creepy sea creatures. Plus, I hate CGI and seafood.<br/><br/>7. The second film was much darker than the first one. If you go for that, then great, but I personally enjoyed the fun, sunny, Disney feel to the first movie. It put a nice smile on your face. DMC doesn't do that. There's a heavy, grey haze over the whole film in actual colour but also just in the general feel of it.<br/><br/>8. Black Pearl had a way more epic feel to it that DMC. I don't quite know why, but it's probably due to a combination of many of the above factors.<br/><br/>9. Black Pearl was just an all-around well-made film. DMC is not.<br/><br/>10. One other thing to mention is that DMC kinda felt like a filler movie. All it did was start a whole bunch of unfinished subplot lines which will be completed in At World's End. Black Pearl was an amazing movie, At World's End looks like it'll be an amazing movie (what with all of the subplots it'll have to finish up and with the return of Barbossa / Geoffrey Rush), but that the only purpose that DMC served was to bridge the two movies and make it all into a trilogy. It's hard to say until I've seen At World's End, but it may have worked better to compress parts 2 and 3 into one sequel.<br/><br/>Now that I'm done venting, I'll say that DMC was pretty descent. A lot of sequels nowadays are complete flops, so, in comparison, DMC was alright. It had a lot to live up to. I mean, Black Pearl was such a success and people would thus be expecting a lot from it's sequel, and, well, it didn't really deliver, but it kinda did. All I'm saying is that, standing on it's own, it would be a pretty crappy movie, but as a sequel to an astonishing movie, it did a fair job.<br/><br/>My final verdict is that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is worth the eight dollars and 2 1/2 hours of your life to see it. Just don't expect it to equal it predecessor."
"ktcloe","7","4","7","9 July 2006"," Not as good as the first
","I was a bit disappointed in POTC; Dead Man's Chest. The plot didn't seem to be very well thought out. As usual, Johnny Depp rescued the film with his entertaining portrayal of Capt. Jack Sparrow, and his crew does an excellent job. Orlando Bloom didn't seem to really get into his part, which seemed diminished, as if the writer(s) really didn't know what to do with him. The ending made us eager for the next installment, and we hope that they have a better plot line and script. The special effects were excellent; the replacement villain and his crew are far more frightening than Barbosa and company. I wouldn't recommend that children under 10 be brought to this movie, as it is very intense in parts, and the creatures are extremely gross. I have a feeling that this will be the last time that Depp reprises a character (after the next POTC, that is) as this film really lost steam."
"vereimeja_03","6","4","7","9 July 2006"," Thoughts on the length of the movie
","This movie was way longer than it needed to be. I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy it, but I thought the action sequences to be somewhat excessive. For this movie to be stretched out to two and a half hours is ridiculous. When I saw it at the drive-in, I was so thankful for the intermission, just to get a break. I don't understand how the studio expected kids, let alone, anyone to sit through this entire film, knowing that the attention span of today's audience is nothing compared to what it used to be. I'm wondering how long the third one is going to be. The movie itself as a sequel was not too shabby but it didn't meet the high hopes I actually had."
"yf21bowman","4","4","7","9 July 2006"," An awful movie that lasted an awful long time
","Where can I begin? This movie had lousy acting from all involved, besides perhaps Johnny Depp (even though his gags are tired, mistimed, and ill directed) and, god help me, Davy Jones. Some of the scenes lasted an unbearably LONG time, with no real excitement or even danger, real or perceived, to the characters. For instance, the 3-way sword fighting scene should have ended..oh, I don't know... 20 minutes before it actually did. Keira Knightley was unbearable, and her ""disguise"" as a man was laughable.<br/><br/>Bottom line: A long movie with no resolution whatsoever, tired old jokes, bad gags, a lot of little in jokes to keep the people who saw the first Pirates movie happy, and really horrible acting from everyone involved. Thumbs DOWN"
"jce108","6","4","7","8 July 2006"," Slightly Disappointing
","I thought that the movie was a fairly big let down after watching such an amazing prequel. Johny Depp was good but not as spectacular as he was in the first film. The special effects were very good and the cliff hanger of an ending was excellent. But overall I thought the plot was rather boring in fact. I also found the movie to be quite a bit longer than it needed to be it could have been maybe and hour and half and been really good but the movie slowed to a crawl at some parts. There were a few humor moments that were very good. And I still recommend seeing it if you liked the second because by the sounds of things the 3rd one will be excellent. However since this is just above average for me I give it a 6 out of 10."
"xctrack22","6","4","7","8 July 2006"," did not live up to expectations
","i was every excited to see this movie since the first one was so well done and entertaining. the movie started out very slow, and there was a part where jack gets trapped on an island near the beginning which was about 30 minutes long, and it was completely pointless and had nothing to do with the plot of the movie. the movie was way too long, and could have easily been shorter. the acting was once again wonderful, and the special effects were amazing, but the storyline and plot were hard to follow and not as well written as the last one. i almost fell asleep during this movie, and i was very disappointed in it. my advice is to see the movie in the theaters because the special effects with loose their ""ommmf"" if seen on the small screen, but don't go having high expectations like i did."

","I was actually excited to see this movie, and once I did I felt a bit disappointed afterwards. It seems the filmmakers decided to make money and not good films, and it shows.<br/><br/>You will see just about every single old character come back for no apparent reason nor is an explanation given. The character development has changed awfully.<br/><br/>You think you know the characters, but they do stuff that is drastically out of part. It will bring back old enemies that should be dead and then decides that the supposed good guys will follow anyone.<br/><br/>The fight scenes and action were top notch, and I would of expected as much. The comedy is fairly good, but it would seem Johnny Depp's performance is a bit phoned in.<br/><br/>I can compare it's story to Halo 2's in the sense the main reason this one was made was so that they could make a third. Where Halo is plot hole free, expect a bumpy ride for POTCII.<br/><br/>Famous quote ""O hey, let's throw in a love triangle for kicks"" If you want a moving experience, then stay away from POTCII.<br/><br/>But if you're on a date and you like talking and discussing the movie, then POTCII is for you. It will keep your attention enough while you can still give your date some needed love.<br/><br/>Any girl review of this movie is tainted by the Johnny Depp effect. (Don't believe me? Check the votes)"
"Sweet_Ophelia","9","4","7","7 July 2006"," Satisfying Sequel
","The sequel to the 2003 mega-hit 'Pirates of the Caribbean' begins shortly where the first film left off. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann's (Keira Knightley) marriage is cancelled when the two, along with Norrington (Jack Davenport) are arrested and set to hang because of their involvement in Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) escape. The arrests seem to be a scheming plan of new character Cutler Beckett (Tom Hallander) who offers Will and Elizabeth a pardon if Will sets out to find Jack and return with his compass. Jack, meanwhile sailing the high seas, has received some disturbing news from beyond the sea-grave; he has to pay his debt to Davey Jones (played by Bill Nighy) who turned Jack into captain of the black pearl 13 years ago in exchange for his soul. Will Turner gets caught up in Jack's predicament, as does Elizabeth who is hot on the duo's trail, having escaped from prison.<br/><br/>This sequel has received mixed reviews; and it seems there is no middle ground when it comes to audience opinion of 'Dean Man's Chest'  you either love it, or you hate it. I loved it. I wouldn't go so far as to say it was better than the first film, but it was a satisfying sequel that left me anxious for the third and final installment. The CGI effects are phenomenal, Johnny Depp is (as always) an absolute delight to watch and the film really does very nicely set-up the storyline for the third sequel 'At World's End' (2007).<br/><br/>'Dead Man's Chest' is notably darker than the 'Curse of the Black Pearl'  there's more horror, gross-out moments and violence  it isn't over the top, the darkness actually adds a mature angle to the film, and makes it stand out from the original. Where 'Curse of the Black Pearl' was decidedly family-friendly, 'Dead Man's Chest' is aiming for an older demographic.<br/><br/>There weren't as many laughs in this film as there were in the original, and there are less quotable lines  understandably the best laugh out loud moments come from Johnny Depp, who is able to once again reveal the depths of his talent and show what an able comedian he is. Depp has particularly impressive command over physical comedy (as was evident in 'Curse of the Black Peal', but is absolutely fantastic in 'Dead Man's Chest'). Though they both really rose to fame because of 'Curse of the Black Pearl', Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom (especially Bloom) are no match for Johnny Depp who is the real power-house of the franchise. The writers clearly understand what an iconic character Jack Sparrow has become, with his own cult following and fandom; thus certain story lines are added to satisfy the throngs of Sparrow fans (like the tension between Jack and Elizabeth) and Johnny is given ample opportunity to give the audience everything they loved about Jack in the original, ten times over in the sequel. Which is great  Johnny Depp is responsible for making these films what they are. <br/><br/>All in all a very satisfying sequel  not as great as the original, but plenty of Jack Sparrow screen time, a darker angle and fantastic lead-up to the final installment make this a very enjoyable film."
"mossfoot","7","4","7","7 July 2006"," Dead Man's Chest... What's Right and What's Wrong
","You know, while this applies to Pirates of the Caribbean, I have a list of beefs against sequels in general <br/><br/>Flaw 1) ""Hey we did that last movie, wouldn't it be cute if we did it again?"" When it's done right, you get Indiana Jones reaching for his gun to shoot the two swordsmen (like he did against the 1 in the previous movie) only to find out it's not there.<br/><br/>When it's done badly, you get ""cute"" repeats of lines you enjoyed the first time so forced that you can't help but feel hammer used to slam it into the script. The ""Dog with the keys"" bit was used not once, but THREE different ways.<br/><br/>Flaw 2) More-itis More-itis is when creators believe that they need essentially the same story, but all the ""cool"" points need to be enhanced to the power of two. This isn't addition or multiplication we're talking about, but exponential.<br/><br/>Might I lay the most brain-hurting example in recent memory: The Mummy and The Mummy Returns: Hey, you had one undead villain before, NOW WE HAVE TWO! Before he was a face of sand, NOW HE'S MADE OF WATER! They flew in a biplane before, NOW IT'S A ROCKET POWERED BALLOON! They fought a bunch of mummies before, NOW IT'S A WAR ON AN EPIC SCALE! It gets old quick.<br/><br/>You imagine people around a table saying ""You know, those undead skeletons in the first movie was cool, how can we top it? Let's have them all sea creature mutants! Each one more weird and deformed than the last!"" Sensory Overload is an increasing problem in Special Effect movies. In this movie, there was so much slimy sea-human body parts flying around you don't know what's attached to what.<br/><br/>An even worse offender is Captain Jack's Great Escape. We all loved Captain Jack's miraculous escape from Norrington's guards at the beginning of the first movie. You know what made it work? NO CGI! It was all traditional stunt work done in prime fashion. Not so here... So many parts of the Great Escape are clearly CGI that you can no longer buy the idea it's actually happening.<br/><br/>Flaw 3) Good Guys Don't Kill Good Guys At one point in the movie you have Captain Jack, Norrington, and Will Turner fighting one another for the key to Davy Jones' locker. It is, in fact, the big climatic sword battle of the movie.<br/><br/>Only it doesn't quite work for me, because you KNOW nobody is going to get hurt. You know Captain Jack and Will Turner are good guys (well, more or less) and as a result will NOT kill another good guy. Norrington is the only ""maybe he'd go bad"" character, but since his opponents are Jack and Will, again there no real danger.<br/><br/>Jack and Will's first duel in the first movie was exciting. In part because you didn't know these characters or where this might be going. Maybe one of them really would get hurt? Not likely but you didn't KNOW one way or the other. Also, you're willing to go along with that if it's a non-climax battle. But this happening at the climax you're thinking ""What's the point? Nobody is going to DIE in this battle!"" I couldn't help but be aware of this throughout the battle, and it makes it drag.<br/><br/>Flaw 4) TO BE CONTINUED You know, this is pretty standard. Empire Strikes Back did it, Lord of the Rings did it (well, you couldn't avoid that, really), The Matrix did it. You make #2 in such a way that you absolutely MUST have #3. There's only one problem here. This was the WRONG movie to use this technique on! All those other movies have some kind of grand story arc involved that intends to climax with the downfall of the Evil (whatever) and good to triumph.<br/><br/>How the hell does that apply here? Captain Jack is going to destroy the East India Trading Company? Yeah, Davy Jones is going to croak, but so what? It's the wrong technique for the wrong storyline. Is Davy Jones going to destroy the world? If so it's news to me! Had I had a bit of warning maybe it wouldn't have bugged me as much, but as we got on the 2 hour mark I was wondering where climactic battle with Davy Jones would be, only it didn't happen! It wasn't till it was clear the Black Pearl was going to sink that I felt the beginnings of To Be Continued creeping up.<br/><br/>Flaw 5) Obey Your Own Goddamn Rules!!! Okay, look, it's not that hard to follow. The cursed Aztec gold made everyone who took it into cursed undead, right? The only way to undo the curse for everyone is for everyone to put the gold back. EVERYONE. Otherwise it doesn't work, right? So why is the monkey still undead? If he's undead, why are the Bumbling Pirate Duo alive? Did the monkey swim to the island and take a fresh coin after the curse was broken? And of course it doesn't even begin to explain why Captain Barrbosa is still alive? He died. We saw him die.<br/><br/>Oh wait, I know! The curse is broken the monkey swims to the island and takes a coin, thus restarting a fresh curse. Then he goes over and puts a fresh coin in Barbosa's dead hand (sure, it'll work with dead people, why not?) thus making him undead and healing his wounds. So Barrbosa is also undead, too, because if the monkey is undead the new curse can't be broken (unless they both put the coins away, breaking the curse and then the monkey took a coin AGAIN to restart a third curse just for himself! Stupid damn monkey) By the way if I'm right I'm going to beat myself over the head with a shovel, because it's weak."

","Before I give you the review I must give you the preamble. I was going to a 10:00 showing Friday Night, got there an hour early and the line was about three yards from the door. Before we got seated, it was out the door. And a group of six white-haired ladies cut in front of us in the line. It would have been funny if it weren't so incredibly rude.<br/><br/>The movie itself was quite amazing, the makeup was frightening the special effects were awesome but we didn't expect any less. Even though the advertisements proclaim that Captain Jack is back, everyone else gets a lot more character development in this film, especially Will, Elizabeth, and Norrington-who looks much better without a white wig. Mackenzie Crook, Lee Arenberg, and Kevin McNally all return to their roles, which have been greatly expanded.<br/><br/>New characters appear including the shockingly horrible Davy Jones, and Bootstrap Bill Turner. And the Kracken, which I won't ruin by telling you about it.<br/><br/>There's much more slapstick, which I highly enjoyed, to this one and everyone gets to participate. I warn you now, the ending is a HUGE cliffhanger.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a wonderful film and highly enjoyable, and while it is two and a half hours long, it doesn't feel that way, because you never get bored.

","Excellent fast paced plot! Definitely put a more cut throat feel on the movie than the original without seeming over the top. There does come a point where the movie becomes less comical than the original but the transition doesn't ruin the movie but instead allows it to expand. I was really hoping that this Pirate saga wouldn't turn out to be all laughs like I figured Disney would probably do. I was afraid that before I went to see the sequel I was going to see Goofy threatening someone to walk the plank. One other thing, it was great to see a Pirate movie where much of the action takes place on the high seas. It's always good to see the parts where there's a dark and scary cave or a dingy bar or a tropical paradise but I always wonder what's going on over at the boat and this one stuck with it. It would take a hardcore landlubber not to like this film. Anyone else with any kind of interest in tall sea tales needs to get to the theater today!"

"aar809","10","5","10","9 July 2006"," Amazing
","i was not a big fan of the curse of the black pearl but i did look forward to seeing this. and i was not disappointed. I already knew Johnny Depp cud act but this convinced me even more. Every scene he was in brought humor and he never failed to capture the audiences attention. The story itself shows to have more twist and complexity in it and definitely surpasses the prequel. lot more fun adventures and stunning and realistic special effects (eg. Davy Jones and his crew and of course the amazing and frightening Kraken). this movie digs even deeper into the nature of pirates and gives us an even better view. u can see the maturity and character developments from the first one (Eg, near the end wen Elizabeth made that decision of strapping sparrow on the pole for the Kraken.) lots of humor all along the movie, humorous lines coming from just bout all the characters, mostly from the staggering jack sparrow. and major roles continued by Depp, turner, and knightly, and u will also see Norrington joining the fun as well. the humorous fight scenes at the island were incredibly fun as all the characters are involved. some say the start of the movie was a bit slow but i particularly liked the re-intro to jack sparrow wen he shoots the bird pecking at his coffin. (Laughed so hard) and i thought all 150 minutes of the movie was well over ""worth it"". the most frightening scenes would probably be with the nicely animated effects on Davy Jones and his crew, or one part that made me jump out of my seat wen they were at the island with the natives thinking jack sparrow was a god or something and someone just jumped out of nowhere, that scene reminded me a bit of king Kong by the way. anyways expect great performances from Johnny Depp and some of the other actors and this movie would not disappoint u no matter what age u r. I give this movie 11/10 =)<br/><br/>ps. this IMDb commentary grammar correcting is annoying... did i spell that right?"
"hestia7","1","5","10","8 July 2006"," Horrible! HUGE Disappointment
","Why oh why do filmmakers think sequel equals more action and less character/relationships/story? Why did they make a film that doesn't stand on it's own (beginning/middle/end)? Honestly, if I saw The Kracken one more time....as it was, after the first time, I just closed my eyes and took a quick nap every time it attacked a ship. The point of Jack being a god to the natives was.....? Another excuse for an action sequence? The non-end so deflated the audience, that it was quiet and people just got up and left the theatre when the credits started to role. Much different from the last one, when the audience cheered at the end and stayed for the coda. In fact, this New York opening day audience was completely quiet throughout the whole film. Just who exactly were we supposed to be rooting for and rooting for them to do what? If I don't care about the characters, then I don't care about the action. The trio wasn't close this time around, no one cared about anyone. Why should I? Did Elizabeth still love Will and vice versa? No clue. Just when did she decide that Jack was more attractive? Or did she? Will certainly wasn't very surprised or moved to see his father again. Neither Will nor Elizabeth cared about Captain Jack, just wanted his compass to use him for their own reasons, they seemed perfectly happy to sell him out. Would they have turned him in to be hanged to save themselves? Get a clue writers and Mr Verbinski. If I don't care about the characters, then I don't care about the action. How the hell did Barbossa come back to life? Should George Lucas sue the writers for plagerism in the Elizabeth kissing Jack marching into the mouth of The Kracken sequence (it's the end of The Empire Strikes Back isn't it?) or was it just different enough for the screenwriters to get away with it.<br/><br/>And now it's just great! I know I get to see the continuation of this boring, over-cgi'd, non-story next year! And with everyone of my least favorite characters. Will I have to wait for the middle of the film for Capatin Jack to appear, since they have to sail to the end of the world to get him. I'll be asleep after the first five minutes if I do.<br/><br/>If they had just used the main characters and made another stand-alone film, then we could look forward to a new story and adventures of Captian Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan. As it is, I will probably see the third installment next year w/no enthusiasm at all, just to see how the train-wreck ends, hoping all the while they will come to their senses and make the movie as wonderful and exciting as the first one.<br/><br/>I saw the first movie in the theatre 5 times and bought the DVD. I won't be back to see this one again and I certainly have no interest in owning it."
"mogulakbar","10","5","10","8 July 2006"," POC: Dead Man's Chest
","Johnny Depp is a pure delight. I was worried that his performance might fall off in this sequel, that he might be a shade bored as he had ""done that."" Not a bit of it. His character, if anything, is richer and more graceful. Whenever he is on the screen, this movie soars. And the writers have added a romantic and marginally heroic sensibility to Captain Jack Sparrow, which Depp incorporates deftly into his performance without blurring any of the sharp edges which define the lovable pirate rascal he created in the first film. Depp is a masterful actor-- perhaps the best we have in American film today. A modern-day Chaplin--less pathetic than the Little Tramp, a bit more openly self-interested, and capable of dropping in a heartbeat from the antics of a comic buffoon to the darkly poetic awareness of one who has consciously cast his life upon the seas of chance in an attempt to conjure up a reality to clothe his abstract ideal--""freedom.' His only current rivals--in my humble opinion--are Anthony Hopkins, Merle Streep, Chris Cooper, and Hilary Swank. It seems ridiculous to observe of a character born of a film inspired by an amusement-park ride, but Captain Jack Sparrow could eventually become Johnny Depp's signature character. Brando is remembered for Stanley Kowalski and Vito Corleone. DeNiro will be remembered for Jake La Motta and Travis Bickle. Gable is remembered for Rhett Butler and the reporter in It Happened One Night. Bogart, despite many brilliant performances--in The Caine Mutiny, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The African Queen, The Maltese Falcon and The Petrified Forest to name a few--will inevitably be remembered as Rick from Casablanca. Hopkins will always be, in our memories, Hannibal Lecter in The Silence of the Lambs. For Johnny Depp, who has long since worked his way into our hearts with such brilliant portrayals as Ed Woods and Edward Scissorhands, our collective memory may focus more and more on Captain Jack Sparrow. Perhaps it is because for the first time Depp seems truly liberated as an actor. We do not have a sense so much in Pirates of the Caribbean that this ""actor"" is drawing a bizarre but believable ""character"" out of a hat --one more dazzling Johnny Depp ""specialty"" made to order--but rather more a feeling that here our boy is playing it pretty close to the bone. Jack Sparrow, as bizarre as he is, feels more real than any Depp character I've ever seen. Maybe this is because in Pirates he's not trying to carefully delineate a portrait that fits some exact, already-defined ""character""-- Scissorhands, James M. Barrie, Gonzo, Donnie Brasco. Sparrow is Depp's own creation--there is no model he needs to constantly refer to as he shapes his performance. So, he can relax. He can, dare I say it, be himself. And the more he is ""himself,"" the more creative freedom he has to do his work as an actor. The more Depp finds self-expression through Captain Jack Sparrow, the more real the performance becomes. At some point it becomes very difficult to separate the actor from the role, and that is the point at which a real performance begins. We never for a second lose sight of the fact that we are watching Johnny Depp play a character, and we never feel that that character is unreal--and there is no conflict. Somehow, Captain Jack Sparrow and Johnny Depp exist in the same moment and together they make one fascinating entity. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is fine--a little overdone in the costumes and some sets and special effects. The plot is unfocused and pointless--they have to be doing something for two-and-a-half hours. There is the corporate threat of the East India Company to counterbalance Captain Sparrow's quest for freedom, and, in the end, nothing much is resolved and there are plenty of loose ends to be taken up in the sequel. <br/><br/>Of the other performances, Keira Knightly's Elizabeth seems to me to be the best. Some of her scenes with Depp are so good they seem about to lift the movie into a realm far more real and moving than an audience at an amusement ride would have a right to expect. She does very well. And the octopus guy is pretty good too. Orlando Bloom is just that--and he does it well. The two pirates from the first film--the short, balding one and his sidekick with one eye--begin to wax philosophical in this film. One is reminded every so slightly of the gravedigger scene in Hamlet, which possibly inspired the writers. If so, please give us more. Those two are turning into something special and they are very funny. Their debate about vowel pronunciation is a little gem.<br/><br/>More depth of character. I know that's not a sentence, but that's what the film needs. With the exception of Mr. Depp, the master, and Miss Knightly, the apt pupil, (and the two aforementioned pirates) no one seems to be doing much except saying the lines and running around. The actor playing Mr. Norrington is trying, but he seems a bit confused about where to go with things. Still, his good guy/bad guy character seems like fertile ground. Is he being held back by the director? In the next Pirates sequel the director would do well to try to let his actors explore a bit more. Johnny Depp gets to do what he wants because he's the ""money,"" but if the others had a chance as well, I can't help feeling the final film would be much more satisfying.<br/><br/>Despite all I've just said, I still give the movie a 10. Why? Number one, Johnny Depp's performance. Wonderful. Number two, Kiera Knightly's performance. Much stronger than the first time out. Number three, the wild silly fun of it all."

","Brilliant movie... one of, if not the best sequel I have ever seen, even more one liners that the first movie. Johnny Depp is again brilliant as the drunken pirate, as his interviews state, he has borrowed a lot when developing his character from his friend Keith Richards (Rolling Stones) and it shows. This movie opens up the unanswered questions from the first, ie, how did he become the drunken pirate, where/how did he get the Black Pearl etc etc. It gives a great deal of anticipation for the third movie in the series. Not to be missed...great in a home theatre..........awesome in a good wide-screen movie theatre with decent surround sound, ( even the seats vibrate from the thunder of cannons)"
"feighery","5","5","10","7 July 2006"," Unsatisfied
","Dead Man's Chest is simply unsatisfying. The first film in the trilogy was full of subtle nuances that were ruined by the second film. Every aspect of the first film that entertained the viewers, either by wowing or with humor, was attempted again, and each was more extreme. Ultimately, this movie played more like a live action cartoon than anything else. Where in the first film, the villain was, if not frightening, at the very least impressive and captivating, this film's nemesis was gross, unappealing to the eyes, and unbelievable. In terms of the characters, where Depp seemed to have found his perfect match in Jack Sparrow in the first film, in this one, the writers made his character simpler, less effective, and silly. He had a sheer brilliance to his disregard for everything that is lost in this film. Their attempt to make him the perfect hero that he is not is a sad turn for what was the most captivating character to hit theatres in years. Bloom, on the other hand, seems to have come into his character, and has found an understanding for the part that actually makes him slightly believable. Knightley is a disgrace. Her character was not believable in the first film, and her dialouge was exactly off, and this film is no change. I left the theatre feeling like I wasted my time and money, and I don't think I will even be able to watch the first film again without regretting where I know the series has gone. IF YOU LIKED THE FIRST FILM, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Be happy that Pirates of the Carribbean, Curse of the Black Pearl, is a perfectly independent movie with no need of a sequel."

","I've seen the first one a million times. I loved Johnny Deep, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly to death. In this one, it made Jack Sporrow the biggest coward ever. Will Turner accomplished nothing. And Elizabeth turned out to be a traitor.<br/><br/>I think there was too much computer animated stuff, and all the people were creepy and demonic looking, although I know it's supposed to be sea creatures.<br/><br/>It was okay, don't let be stop you from seeing it, but it's kinda like the Matrix. Well not in plot or idea, it was just like the second Matrix movie, when it finally progresses, the movie is over with. But you should still see it though just so you know what is going on. It was kind of obvious that the movie was about to end, I leaned over and whispered to my sister, ""It was just getting good, and now it's over!"" a second before the movie ended."

","With the first ""Pirates"" movie, I went into not expecting much. The second time around, my hopes where much higher for this movie, yet unfortunately they were unfulfilled. Most of the humor of the movie was just run-offs from the last movie, beating the ""rum"" running gag to death. They seemed to spend all their time with special effects instead of investing it into making an easy to follow plot. The swash-buckling feel the first ""Pirates"" left you with seemed to be absent from this movie. Instead, you were just wondering how much longer was left in the movie.<br/><br/>There were bright points to this movie, such as Jack Davenport as Norrington. Johnny Depp will not disappoint his legion of teeny-bopper fans that fell in love with him in the first ""Pirates"" though, it may make some more die hard Johnny fans disappointed to see him play the same character once again.<br/><br/>Some are calling this the new age's ""Empire Strikes Back,"" but I think a closer association would be to ""Phantom Menace.""

The breathtaking scenery would have carried this movie alone, from the dark and bleak setting of the Flying Dutchman to the lush and green tropics of the cannibal island.

","I had such high hopes for this film - I played hooky from work during my lunch hour (or three!). The action scenes go on far too long, the movie is way too long, and neither the script nor the action sequences are anywhere near the swashbuckling fun of the first film. It appears the writer and the director get lost between story lines, and they're unable to create a cohesive plot, as well as any symbiosis between the characters. ""Dead Man's Chest"" was sadly predictable, plodding and quite un pirate like. There are very few parts that amuse and surprise, unfortunately. Please, return to the ""formula"" of the first picture, and don't torture us with another Dead Man's Chest for the third. Deeply, deeply, deeply disappointed - deep in the heart of Texas."
"Solipsisticblog","5","6","13","7 July 2006"," Curiously flat
","Sadly, this movie does not succeed. It's big, there's plenty of spectacle, and lots of deep sea beasties, but it all feels flat. The closing moments bring a great surprise and give the movie a needed shot of adrenaline. One of the biggest flaws is that the movie takes little time to develop characters or recap some key plot points from the movie released three years ago. It jumps right in to the story and makes many references to much of the mystical mumbo jumbo from the first film. Before we know it, all the characters are off on another quest for more mystical mumbo jumbo all of which hinges on the mumbo jumbo from the first film. I quickly got really lost. I'd explain the plot, but it's really a secondary concern. Just know that Capt. Jack Sparrow, Will and Elizabeth all set out to sea tracking down mystical trinkets.<br/><br/>I was tired when I saw the movie so my comprehension was diminished, but I think if you are fully alert when you see this, you will still be hard pressed afterward to comprehend all that you have seen. This movie pays less attention to letting the audience participate in the story and more with distracting them. It's film-making sleight of hand. Jerry Bruckheimer, who produced the atrocity ""Armageddon,"" produced this as well and it suffers from the typical Bruckheimer problem of spectacle over storytelling. It's also 2 1/2 hours which the movie can't adequately carry.<br/><br/>There are some amazing action moments in the movie, but they can't buoy this unwieldy spectacle. If you're like me, you're gonna go see this just for the pure summer spectacle of it, but be warned that it is executed far less adroitly than many of the summer escapes that we have already witnessed. Go see ""Poseidon"" or ""MI:3."" They're quick, slick, and easy to follow.

","As a theatre owner, I have the distinct privilege of viewing advance trade screenings. Last week, I attended the PotC2 screening in Seattle. To say I am excited about the premiere of this movie would be an understatement. I think it will be THE movie of the summer, and may well break records.<br/><br/>PotC2 doesn't exactly pick up right where the first left off, but close enough. Will and Elizabeth's nuptials are rudely interrupted by arrest. Then Will is sent off to find one Jack Sparrow, and his compass, in order to free Elizabeth from jail. Elizabeth, never one to sit around and wait for someone to rescue her, manages to escape herself, and goes after him.<br/><br/>The next 2 hours and 20 minutes is full of plot twists, re-introductions of familiar characters and introductions of a few new ones. Oh. And a few (okay, a lot) great CGI special effects that just seem to get more seamless and impressive with each movie. Once the principles are together (more or less) the fun really begins, and the barbs are slung with the same fervor as swords are swung. Somehow managing to worm his way darn near into an equal starring role in this movie is the oh-so-proper Commodore Norrington, who is not quite so proper anymore. This character's fleshing out is arguably the best subplot in the show, and Jack Davenport's obvious delight in giving us a good look at Norrington's ugly side is a hoot.<br/><br/>The first Pirates was a bit of a surprise hit, because, I think, it took an old (some would even say used up) idea, and made it new again. Depp's unexpectedly weird and yet somehow vulnerable turn as Captain Jack Sparrow caught the attention of a broad slate of the movie-going public, and this one continues that idea in spades. Yes, the first hour seems overly long, and jumps around so much that anyone who has NOT seen the first one will be hopelessly confused by it. This is mostly because the first half of this movie sets up the events that follow in both the last half of this movie and the larger general storyline of the third. The last hour of this show more than makes up for the complicated first half. Go to the bathroom before it starts, because you will not want to get up and leave once the fun really kicks in. You might also miss crucial plot points.<br/><br/>The last 10 minutes of the movie give us (and poor Will, too) so much to contemplate over the next 10 months or so it's almost painful, but while the cliffhanger ending might frustrate some, I thought it was very fitting to leave the audience hanging much the same way the old serials did. It would have been much less pleasant if we didn't know the third installment was pretty much in the can already and poised to release in May 2007. Be ready to hear the audience erupt in cheers during the last 30 seconds. Then sit there through the credits thinking to yourself, ""but I want to see the third one RIGHT NOW!"" Then watch the little after-the-credits vignette and leave the theatre still thinking to yourself ""but I want to see the third one RIGHT NOW!"" As the summer blockbuster season this year has been lackadaisical at best, I suspect that most everyone is waiting for this movie. I don't think they are going to be disappointed."

","Very few times in my life I've got that migraine, provocation, and the desire to sleep right in the theater. Maybe (Universal Soldier: The Return - 1999) for example, (Miami Vice - 2006) for another. But, this time, I was in such a great anger too!<br/><br/>Forget all of the insane people who think that this nonsense is a movie. Forget the fact of (Johnny Depp) being a great comedian. Forget that the first movie was nice and maybe the first also in mixing pirates movies - which we really missed for a very long time - with the fantasy factor, (Jerry Bruckheimer)'s money, and perfect CGI. Forget all of that. Because HERE, you'll find nothing but terrible tragic headache!<br/><br/>OH GOD. It's distastefully satiate, so boring, and despite the huge look; very poor. In fact, there is no nothing. No great action, or good thrilling moments. There isn't even a good dialogue or one, just one-liner. At one point, (Depp) managed to escape from some savages, then while getting finally on his ship, he was about to crack a punch line for his failing chasers, but he didn't. Simply no one wrote a thing for that!<br/><br/>Explicitly there isn't anything funny, except the case of this plot which I dare anyone to understand it, or even stand it after any understanding. Scrutinize well: The good guys are searching for the dead evil man's heart to finish it, namely kill the man who already lives with no heart (!) but according to these very movies' logic, dead people used to be so alive anyway (just recall the last shot in here), so what could deter this evil man from coming back to life after this so-called killing?? He's living as a ghost already! I told you earlier, noting is funnier than this plot (funnier as odder!).<br/><br/>Most probably there wasn't any plot in the first place. They just designed couple of action sequences, one in the middle and one at the end, then put around them too many storylines and unnecessary scenes to end up as a long awful time. Briefly, it's too much ado about nothing. And when the first was good, so with a sequel as bad as this; you must feel disappointed and deceived as well!<br/><br/>..And there were 200 million in the production of THIS TRASH???!!! By simple equation, this equals, in my country's money, over 100 movies where every one of them is cost 8 millions pounds. This is extra, and ENORMOUS, reason to be mad, especially when you watch this drivel of a movie!<br/><br/>I believe the explanation is that the big blown up success of the first one abetted (Bruckheimer) to milk more and more money from it. However, with hasty - talented in only blabbering - writing, no kind of excitement, no sense of humor from EVERYBODY, with big sophisticated CGI, costumes and sets--the outcome was that uninteresting heavy thing which we wanted to leave the theater while watching it since the intermission!<br/><br/>About all the writers of all the previous comments which were entitled (The Best Action Movie, The Greatest Film Ever, BLAH BLAH BLAH!!!!!); it's bogus, it's fake, don't you ever buy it. Most likely they were watching the first one!<br/><br/>THE MAIN LESSON HERE IS: Don't believe the huge propaganda, and judge by yourself. But in this very case, bear the headache!"

Once again we have Johnny ""pretty boy"" Depp demonstrating how acting in this film clearly is out of his Depp, all the guy does the whole time is shake like a junkie and come out with rubbish lines like ""yeh sorry mate"" which seriously arn't funny. He claims he based his character on Keith Richards, though in my opinion Keith Richards isn't a flaming pirate! Girls constantly rave on about how fantastic he looks in this film, though I think he just looks like he was bought in from under a railway bridge attempting to recite Gypsy King Songs on his guitar. Anybody could have played ""captain jack pinhead"" and pulled it off well. The only ""Hollywood heartthrob"" who actually bothered to act in this film was Orlando Bloom, if you can get past his constant dramatic shouting. All the other cast played their roles out fine; they weren't the people responsible for putting the music up so loud that it actually gave me a headache.<br/><br/>I was privileged enough to see the special features on the DVD. It clearly demonstrated how much money they wasted and to top all the off, they started putting props and sets together without even knowing what the story is! They then go on to mention how they want to trim off $2million from their already ridiculously too high budget. Don't get me started on how over the top the special effects were.<br/><br/>Now I can see why people like this film, but I just think it's one of these films that have way too much money spent on them ""High-profile"" in this day in age is ""high-budget"" and high budget seems to always make a film very tedious.

I'm sure many people would have stopped a few minutes in upon realizing ""Nope, I wasn't tired, it really IS bad"", but you see, I REALLY liked the first Pirates movie, so I thought there HAD to be something to come (a fun Sparrow moment, some really good swashbuckling, a good Knightly eye-candy moment). Nope, nada, ziltch, nothing. All this movie is - is the worst sequel to a great movie since Temple of Doom - a money-making CGI-fest regurgitation of what some writers thought would pass as film. As I can see from the large percentage of 10s it has received on this site, the film-makers obviously found something appealing to someone. The sexual appeal of the leads? The CGI? (which was mediocre at best) It certainly couldn't have been the morass of a confusing narrative, could it? Oh well, I can only speculate. And I can only hope that Pirates gets back on track with #3, which will hopefully be what The Last Crusade was to the Indiana Jones trilogy, a fun movie that makes you forget about how bad the second movie was."

Johnny Depp does a commendable job and Keira Knightley as as beautiful as ever, but Orlando Bloom is as stiff as ever and no ""plot"" point makes sense. Not to mention, did we really need to have a 30 min sword fight between Depp, Bloom, and whatever his name was? Ghastly that this movie is the highest grossing of the year. Then again, given what America craves these days (and it's not exactly quality) I can't say that I'm not surprised. It's beautiful to watch at times, but come on, I felt like my I.Q. was dropping by the point during this movie.

This time the three set out on the high seas in search of the key to Davy Jones' legendary treasure.<br/><br/>Replete with creatures straight out of Greek mythology, the plot consists of little more than one absurdly over-the-top set piece after another with little heed paid to either continuity or coherence - and none at all to characterization. Even Depp's mincing, oddly flamboyant Captain Sparrow, which was the one element of quality in the original outing, has faded into the background, doomed to insignificance amidst all the overwrought special effects (Bloom and Knightley are their usual bland selves). For here, indeed, is a movie without so much as a single trace of literacy, grace or style to go along with its box office booty, an assembly-line manufacture if ever there was one.<br/><br/>Hectic rather than rousing, this is crass commercial movie-making of the most cynical and hollow sort.

How about when Jack magically appears back on board the Black Pearl despite having just been shown halfway to shore in his rowboat? For that matter when the rifle got knocked out of Keira's hands?<br/><br/>This film suffered from the main problems that Back to the Future 2 did, namely it didn't resolve anything and simply served as a 2.5 hour trailer for the third film. The filmmakers forgot that a sequel needs to serve as a complete, entertaining film on its OWN. IMHO, that is the biggest hazard of the ""make parts two and three back to back"" philosophy of modern film-making; all involved are SO aware of what happens in part three, part two loses its own identity.<br/><br/>Frankly I found myself expecting that THIS would be where part two ended every five minutes for the last 45 minutes of the film, and clock watching isn't what should happen when viewing a truly good film."

The rest of Barbossa's crew stopped being undead...what happened to the monkey? I give the filmmakers credit for 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner; he was a well-done character, and I really did like him. Will continues to have issues with his temper, but overall he's still fairly likable. The soothsayer, bayou woman, whatever you call her, was an interesting character. Elizabeth, however, gets less and less likable as the movies go on. She's so busy defying the ""damsel in distress"" label that she becomes completely unrealistic. Also, pardon my language, she's a right bitch. While I admired her determination at the beginning of the movie, by the end of the movie I wanted to throttle her.<br/><br/>With a title like ""Dead Man's Chest"", you'd think there'd be more rum involved; then again, Jack himself asks, ""Why is the rum always gone?"" then gets up, staggers drunkenly, and adds to himself, ""Oh, right, that's why."" Personally, I think the rum gag is a bit overused.<br/><br/>They didn't do anything with the dog either. In Shakespeare, there is never a character on stage without a reason. My father and I both expected there to be a reason for the dog, but it seems to me that he's just a running gag. The question is going to be, what can they do with him in the next movie? And will he ever have a purpose? All in all, I was not impressed. The movie was okay and had one or two redeemable qualities, but overall, the only thing that is going to get me to go see the last movie is, as Jack and Elizabeth both said at various times, ""Curiosity."""
"Psyche17","5","3","5","11 September 2006"," Really Bad Eggs
","The year 2003 marked the year in my life that I blew all my allowance money to go see Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl six times in the theatre, that I rented every old Johnny Depp movie I could get my hands on, that I taped any and all Johnny Depp TV appearances, and that I filled a scrapbook with magazine articles, quotes, and pictures of I think you can guess who. Johnny Depp's unprecedented performance of a Keith Richards and Pepe LePieu-channeling pirate anchored the success of Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl as perhaps one of the most beloved summer blockbusters to date. When I learned the sequel would not come out for another three years after the first film, I thought I would never be able to wait that long! I was right. By 2006, my Johnny Depp scrapbook had long since been shoved under my bed and the TV appearances had long since been taped over. When I bought my ticket for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, I wondered secretly if my infatuation would be rekindled. It wasn't.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that the most critical problem with PotC:DMC probably lies in the fact that Johnny Depp's performance can no longer be described as ""unprecedented,"" seeing as it is just a re-hash of the character he coined in 2003. Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow radiated so brilliantly in the first film that it let the film's otherwise obvious flaws slide by unnoticed by the audience. PotC:DMC, however, is inundated with flaws to the point that not even Captain Jack can remain afloat.<br/><br/>In PotC:DMC, Captain Jack is back, but he forgot to bring his wit and charisma. In the first film, it was so thrilling to watch as he ingeniously manipulated every situation, no matter how dire, to work to his advantage. In this film he wears funny face paint and makes lame rum jokes in incessant references to Curse of the Black Pearl. Jack Sparrow, why is your originality gone? It's a shame that one of the most innovative characters in recent cinematic history has become static and flat, unless you count a frantic shish kabob running across the screen as character development.<br/><br/>Another crucial problem with this film is the main villain, Davey Jones. In the original, we had the marvelous Geoffrey Rush playing Barbossa free from the constraints of CGI disfigurement. While I don't presume to imply that Bill Nighy lacks Rush's acting skills (on the contrary, I've always enjoyed Bill Nighy's work), I do believe that the CGI inhibited him from giving a satisfying performance. While I understand that high-tech devices can be used to track the actor's facial movements, I can not for one second believe that a tentacle-faced cartoon could equal the expressiveness of a professional actor such as Nighy.<br/><br/>The original Pirates had witty dialogue and colorful characters, PotC:DMC has the Kraken. One of the overlooked flaws of the first film was that it had about 30 minutes too much CGI-based action. PotC:DMC takes this flaw and tacks on another 15 minutes. This time, however, instead of clever quips and charm to off-set the intense action sequences, we get re-used jokes and references to the first film. Yes, Captain Jack is still rooting for Norrington, and I'm still rooting for Dead Man's Chest come up with one line of original dialogue.<br/><br/>Part of the problem, I think, is that each of the three main characters spends too much time apart from others. Will Turner goes off on his own adventure aboard Davey Jones' ship where he meets his long lost father, Elizabeth escapes from jail and stows away on a merchant ship, and Captain Jack alternates between the company of each. It seems as though the relationships and interactions of the main characters are treated as after thoughts to the special effects and are given little time to develop on screen. The romance between Will and Elizabeth, which blossomed so beautifully in the first film, is destroyed by one or two provocative glances between Jack and Elizabeth and a compass that tells her what she wants. Is Elizabeth so fickle that a few weeks apart from her fianceé could drive her into the arms of his sometimes-adversary? Did I miss something from the first film that I was supposed to pick up on? Was this love triangle really necessary, no matter how honest Elizabeth's motives in locking lips with Jack? On the up-side, if this movie succeeded in one thing, it was to get me excited for its third and final episode. Captain Jack Sparrow may not be able to shiver me timbers like he used to, but he's a good ol' friend and I can't just abandon him quite yet. PotC:DMC, in my opinion, was a sorry disappointment in comparison with its predecessor, but I think I feel a change in the winds says I. I have a feeling about the third film, just a feeling, but I think there's still a chance for redemption."

It's supposed to be fighting Godzilla in Tokyo or Osaka. <br/><br/>2. There's no nudity in the movie because ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is a family movie.

I particularly like the way Gore Verbinski has reenacted relationships among main characters and rebuilt the new plot, just as Lucas did with The Empire Strikes Back. All the characters did a good job: Keira Knightley shines as Elizabeth Swann strengthening her presence in the action times, Johnny Depp is as wonderful as usual, Orlando Bloom plays a much better part than in the former movie thanks to the more intricate and compelling plot.

The film follows our protagonists Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swain battling for their lives with a wicked Octopus disfigured man Davy Jones. Johnny Depp was quite a showstopper in the original Black Pearl, but his pirate show wears thin and is not much of an ""eye-opener"" in the sequel.

"NovemberKin","3","3","5","5 September 2006"," It has the same characters as POTC: COTBP but don't be fooled it's not the same type of movie.
","I was excited about this movie, because I really enjoyed the adventure packed first part of this soon to be trilogy. I loved the portrayal Johnny Depp made of his now legendary character Captain Jack Sparrow, and I love the fact that the movie didn't take itself to seriously. It was a very good popcorn flick with not to many over complicated twists and gave room for very much entertainment.<br/><br/>But even POTC can't flee from the most terrible curse of them all, I'm talking about the curse of the bad sequel. A curse that has struck many movies and destroyed many franchises. Unfortunately in these days we live in people want money and press out every penny on anything that can make them a quick buck, I think ""Dead Mans Chest"" is a perfect example of that. They made a sequel (technically two) over the course of 3 years.<br/><br/>Well the troubles of DMC begin right at the start as I and my friends thought that we had entered the wrong movie when it began, it was so dark and so melodramatic from the start. The first 5 or so minutes you just might believe that this movie is a horror movie set in the 18th - 19th century. Nothing of the light hearted first movie is to be seen the climate of the movie is set right from the start but not as a adventure comedy type of movie, but a dead serious pirate movie.<br/><br/>Well then is the entrance of Captain Jack Sparrow that is actually a worthy tie to the one in ""POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl"" only a bit more morbid. I'm not saying this movie doesn't have comedic moments, but there are a lot fewer then in the first and a lot more serious at that. So much so that I never really laughed out loud but smirked at the funny moments in the movie, cause they felt misplaced, this movie had no real comedic feel to it.<br/><br/>I won't tell you the story cause you've probably already read it but what I will say is that you can just as well skip this movie and wait for the 3rd part of the installment cause what this really was, was a 2 and a half hour long trailer cause it ends worse then ""Matrix Reloaded"" and I am not joking, I felt cheated and aggravated. You do not get a whole story for your money, there is no end to ""Dead Man's Chest"".<br/><br/>You can actually feel how Jerry Bruckheimer wanted a ending (or forced it upon the writers) like this to guarantee that people would want to go see the third part of the installment. I'm sorry to say that Hollywood endings have changed a lot through out the years their not happy endings now, their just not concluded.<br/><br/>This movie is dark, it's not something I would let small children see (unlike the first one), it's beautifully shot, has top notch cgi and amazing sets but that's just not enough, without a good story none of that matters."

In fact i would say 'Dead Man's chest' was better even that the first and although this movie was a continuation of the first it could stand on it's own. If there were any negatives to the movie i was say that Keira was it. I don't know why but I just cannot stand her. I also hated the end because of the 'to be continued.....'.

I just have to tell you one part of the movie, this made me very angry, and if you also adore Johnny Depp it will you too, there is a part towards the end of the movie where Elisabeth (Kiera Knightly) steals a kiss from Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp).

","If you are a still a sucker for good CGI effects then you'll like it as some of this is pretty good (rogue pirates and kraken). But after so many years of groundbreaking computer graphics, this is hardly a recipe for success anymore. I found the dialogue terrible, with little wit or intelligent humour to be found. Everything felt corny and flat. At times the the clarity of dialogue was also questionable. Storyline was convoluted as characters and script wasn't very well strung together and just left me brainlessly soaking up action scene after action scene but feeling empty about the overall depth of experience. These actors were stretched to 1% of their actual acting capacity (except for a couple whom actually had the scope in their character to really shine)."
"john-quel","9","3","5","25 August 2006"," ""There's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow.""
","The quote in the summary is from Shakespeare and while not wanting to appear pretentious, I thought I would try something different in this mini-essay, something more along the lines of a critical assessment than an actual review (irrelevant now -- the audience has spoken, decisively) because I believe many of the A-list critics (see www.rottentomatoes.com for the grim details), missed the boat on this wonderful film. <br/><br/>This is a fully and beautifully realized world of myth, magic, and voodoo and happily everyone keeps a straight face as they confront it. If the symbology is a bit too literal at times, well, the sea brings that out in people, particularly in this part of the world of three centuries ago. Where creatures, such as the Kraken, a beast of relentless fury, can be slowed but not stopped. Where the ""heartless"" Davy Jones collides with the Flying Dutchman (a conflation that I believe is a first). And where, despite the rich fantasy, the emotions, conflicts, psychologies are all too real, even in Jack Sparrow (the role Johnny Depp was born to play). He is heading for a terrible fall, as in truth are all the major characters. Elizabeth has come to understand that whatever the degree of her attraction for Jack, the man simply cannot be trusted. His core is hollow, which I suspect Jack himself now realizes and is at the root of his deep problem that he no longer knows what he wants. He knows what he doesn't want, to be sure, yet it is unclear to what degree he can fight back against even that realization. And poor Will Turner, clearly stretched to the limit, is in a situation nearly as bad. Others are also in supreme jeopardy. (One of the great things about this film is the taking of minor characters from the first film, such as Norrington, and putting them head to head against Sparrow and Turner -- and watching them hold their own as they come to grips with their own fate.)<br/><br/>In short, there is the possibility for great tragedy here -- if the writers have the courage to follow through (no more rum and cross-dressing jokes, please!) Could we have a Hamlet on the high seas? I believe we could. The elements are there -- but will marketing permit it? It's anyone's guess. Following the analogy of POTC:DMC being the ""Empire Strikes Back"" of the trilogy, we all know what happened in that case: will a great opportunity be lost as we endure the sea-going equivalent of ""Ewoks?"" Or worse? I am worried. As is well-known, shooting of the third film began before the script was complete, a bad sign. The next installment could go all the way (on the order of ET and Titanic), but it would be foolish to count on it.<br/><br/>Still to have come this far is an incredible achievement. To those A-list critics (3:2 against) who either did not watch the movie or could not bring themselves to view the first film -- there's a reason it's called a sequel, guys -- for shame. But as noted, the public, and indeed the world, has spoken. Good luck to all people involved in the production of the concluding film : ""At World's End."""
"juubei-2","3","3","5","23 August 2006"," Worst sequel I have seen in awhile
","The first one was much better than I thought it would be, given that it was based on a Disney Land theme park ride. I didn't really feel like it needed to be turned into a trilogy, however when the sequel was announced I thought what the hell - maybe it will surprise me. Sadly this film falls into the category of over produced Hollywood cash grab. Which is too bad because there's plenty of potential for a good action adventure movie. I probably should've guessed something was fishy when they announced Keith Richards would put in an appearance as Depp's father (though not in this film, lucky us we have something to look forward to in #3).<br/><br/>The first movie was great because of the actors. Unfortunately it appears the directors and producers got a little too excited about special effects and have crammed the movie with pointless and redundant action scenes that don't really give the actors a chance to do their thing. I felt like I barely saw anything of Will Turner or the others. Johnny Depp managed to recapture the general attitude of Captain Jack but the terrible script fails him time and again. Bill Nighy ""virtually"" steals the show as Davey Jones, though there's not much left of him besides his voice and penetrating eyes.<br/><br/>Granted the visual effects are some of the best I have ever seen, especially the animation on Davey Jones tentacle beard. But the scenes with the Kraken drag on endlessly when they should be heart pounding, and the swashbuckling action scenes are often so badly choreographed you never feel they are actually fighting. And how about the offensive cannibal natives? What was that all about? Too many scenes are nothing more than cartoony gags fishing for cheap laughs, you could practically hear a pin drop in the theater as the actors were put through infantile slapstick routines. Many jokes concerning secondary characters are shamelessly rehashed and its just plain boring.<br/><br/>People who compare this to Empire Strikes Back apparently forgot that Empire was full of revelations. At the end of Empire we're left wondering if Vader is really Luke's father and if we'll ever see Han Solo alive again. At the end of this one we feel no closer to any resolution, having learned nothing of our heroes, without even a second thought as to whether or not Jack will make it out of there just fine. Its so painfully obvious where this is all headed. Its really quite a bad comparison to make because Empire was the strongest of the three Star Wars films and this will likely be remembered as the weakest of the Pirates trilogy.<br/><br/>From the trailer I assumed we'd see Will Turner and Miss Swann rejoin Captain Jack aboard the Black Pearl for more swashbuckling adventures on the high seas. This movie somehow managed to deliver this wrapped in a boring and convoluted mess of a package. Waste of my time and the first film's potential.<br/><br/>ironically I give it 3 stars for the special effects, which ruthlessly drown the rest of the production"

However this one I found myself trying to keep myself awake during the whole movie.They just took everything too far, especially the comedy, for example the fighting one the water wheel between jack norrington and will was funny at first but i was soon thinking... come on get on with it. The same goes for the part where jack was trying to get free and will and the crew were trying to get out of the cage made of bones. One other thing... Kiera you cant do comedy.. so don't even try, that bit on the beach when jack norrington and will were fighting was lame ""oh i cant breath"" - faint.. Yes it was good in the first one but seriously, time to move on.. which brings me to the constant use of the rum jokes, one or two are OK but i don't even want to know how many were in this one, honestly.

","Pirates 2 is an extremely overlong, disappointing mess of a movie. It's about 1 hour too long. At 90 minutes, this film could have been very good. The effects are good, the makeup is outstanding, but there is no story to speak of. The acting is passable, saved mostly by Keira Knightly who, like in the first film, acts everyone off the screen.<br/><br/>I didn't stay for the ""extra scene after the credits"" - I was already exhausted by the film. The ending was disappointing - even though I knew there was a twist coming, I didn't know what. My idea for a BETTER twist (and what I thought was actually coming) is to have Tia Dalma say that SHE will captain the ship that will go to find Jack. THEN you'd have me lining up for Pirates 3 tickets. As it stands now, with an old retreaded character promising to appear in Pirates 3, I am finished with this series for good.<br/><br/>Save your money and see it on DVD if you must."
"alex-brooks6","8","3","5","14 August 2006"," As good as the first?
","Naturally, when I went to see this film, I was expecting it to be good, after the first's success. I was impressed, to say the least. Although many others would probably tell you 'there wasn't any need for a sequel' or 'the plot's too confusing', I strongly disagree.<br/><br/>The first few minutes seemed slightly strange to me; as in why was Jack Sparrow being thrown off of an island in a coffin? Plus, the first three-quarters of an hour were just a tad bit slow (probably because there wasn't any action!), but the plot began to thicken from there.<br/><br/>When the first movie was released I'd never even heard of the name 'Gore Verbinski'. He seems to have made quite a good job, with both films so far.<br/><br/>The plot to the film was just slightly complex, but fairly easy to grasp if you take notice.<br/><br/>The acting was superb from everyone. Johnny Depp seems to have gotten better at being Captain Jack if nothing else, while Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom support him well (they're not bad on their own anyway).<br/><br/>There are some major action sequences, especially the three-way sword battle on Isla Cruces, and following that the spinning wheel part.<br/><br/>I'm sure everyone wants to know what happens next, especially as the film ends so suddenly. I think the thing we all want to know is: how the HELL did Barbosa come back to life?! 8/10 in my opinion."
"ColinInLa","4","3","5","14 August 2006"," Huge disappointment
","The first was delightfully inventive, subversive and thoroughly entertaining. The follow-up, sadly, is a bloated and confused mess. Giving Depp little to work with, the strong lead character who drives the initial film has not evolved. This time around Sparrow's been reduced to a role of lesser import and, painfully, one comprised primarily of repetitive buffoonery. <br/><br/>Too many under-developed characters and a convoluted plot, the sequel relies on CG histrionics to sustain energy and fails miserably, collapsing under its own weight. Bill Nighy is terrific, easily giving the film's best performance. But Dead Man's Chest simply crumbles down around him and commits a film's worst sin: it becomes tedious and ultimately boring. <br/><br/>Of course, none of this matters one whit. Marketed to a fair-thee-well, this film has become a must-see event that has transcended the need to be an artistic success. Matrix 2 and 3 anyone?"
"owlglass","9","3","5","13 August 2006"," The Dark Side of the Caribbean
","There appear to be numerous people who expected more of the same of what was in _Curse of the Black Pearl_ and complain that either they didn't get it, or else that what they got wasn't the part of what they expected. Which makes one wonder what they expected or had hoped for to begin with; and why they would be deluded enough to think that it was even possible to provide said elements. 'The same only different' is almost impossible to deliver. Every time it's been tried, it failed to excite, excepting neophobes. _Dead Man's Chest_ provides a nice combination of some of the expected, with a fairly good and sensible continuation of the story. Reminds me of Star Wars, episodes 4-6. Only this one is better. There you go: heresy! Seriously though: think of where PotC:CotBP ended. Sparrow gets away, but is likely to be pursued by Norrington across the seas. Jack has unfinished business with dark powers. Will and Elizabeth plan to marry. Pirates are about to be executed en masse, what with there being no anti-capital-punishment demonstrators handy. The East India Trading Company, an organization with a tainted history, and one of the precursors of modern multinationals, invades the Caribbean, piggy-backing its activities on the military colonial presence. The nasty monkey from PotC:CotBP steals a piece of gold and becomes immortal; but you had to watch through the end-credits to see that bit. Someone from the East India Company watches a DVD of PotC:CotBP, and so finds out about the Aztec treasure and that it is to be avoided at all cost.<br/><br/>What follows in this sequel is, as far as one can expect this in a silly fantasy flick, a view at the possible consequences. Norrington fails to find Jack and becomes a drunk eager to get back into the good graces of the powers-that-be; revealing dark streaks to his nature. Dark elements also surface in Elizabeth, who has always been a bit attracted to Jack and he to her, and who uses this for an act that she eventually probably regrets; something so ultimately pragmatic and survival oriented that I couldn't believe it at first. Will tries to be noble, but finds it extremely difficult, even though he's far more naive than his fiancÃ©e. Confronted with his father, he is pushed to places he might not otherwise have gone.<br/><br/>The darknesses found in the characters reveals depth, as darkness always does, and makes them very much more interesting and three-dimensional. As a result the movie bears about the same relationship to the original that The Empire Strikes Back had to the original Star Wars. In many ways it works better, because one has the feeling that the writers aren't going for some grand deep-and-meaningful cosmic salvage plan, and are also avoiding thoroughly annoying elements like those pesky and tedious Ewoks. There is very little 'cute' factor in _Dead Man's Chest_; some pretty horrific stuff, implied and off-camera, but potentially disturbing for children; nice gross creatures; lots of ""har har""; evil multinationals represented by psychopaths; great visuals and lots of noise; more twists and turns that you can shake a stick at, which a lot of people found confusing, but who cares about them; lots of shtick; and a Johnny Depp, who treads a fine line between being funny and becoming annoying, so much so that I almost hope we won't see much of him in the final installment, but focus on the interesting people in the mix: those less concerned with parodying themselves.<br/><br/>Despite Depp it was thoroughly enjoyable, and I have no problems with the lack of denouement. We lived through LotR, did we not? Except, of course, that there we knew the outcome...<br/><br/>Till Noever, owlglass.com"

Also, I must've been asleep when they explained how Jack Sparrow ended up in a mysterious island death-fortress. The original ""pirates"" was the best movie ever based on an amusement park ride. The second version just seems random in places. The whole cannibal sequence, while amusing, just seemed out of place. Did we really need the ""commodore"" to return when we already have some new nastier villains from the East India Company? I know, I know, it's a never-ending cliffhanger type deal, but even Gilligan's Island gave us some closure at the end of each episode. I was left cold after this one. Where's the rest of the movie?"

","you know, I'm not going to lie I was expecting a lot from this film. Johnny Depp is one of my all time favorite actors, and I think he's infinitely talented, but not even he could fully salvage this blockbuster. The first and second films seemed disconnected almost entirely which was probably my biggest qualm with this movie. The character's motives at times also seem rather confused, in particular in respect to Johnny Depp and Keira Knightley parts (and their relationship... and his sexuality...). The effects as expected were amazing to say the least however; a semi redeeming element of the film, however the feeling that this movie was a complete sellout just cant seem to leave me alone. Honestly perhaps this trilogy was better left as a single film."
"dst-thomas","4","3","5","6 August 2006"," One very very long follow-on.
","This film is an excellent example of a work that could have been trimmed down substantially to make a final product that would be much more enjoyable. It obviously cost a fortune to make, and it's more than apparent that a lot of talent was used to facet every face of it. But uncut, it sags under its own weight, and I found myself wondering how long the seemingly endless scenes would drag on. The groaning, weighty musical score does not help out at all here. The cannibal sequence could have been either trimmed greatly, or eliminated in its entirety, and so many scenes could have been shortened to advance the pacing. For example, the ""Tia Dalma"" character commands your attention, but does her unintelligible voodoo-princess spiel have to go on and on and on? One shudders to think what a ""director's cut DVD"" version of this film project might include. Could there possibly exist any deleted scenes? Whereas Jack Sparrow thoroughly entertained me in the first film, Mr. Depp's character pops around his scenes in ""Dead Man's Chest"" like ""Mario"" in an old Nintendo game. It seems like his talents are greatly encouraged, but never actually given the proper showcase to light up the screen. Mr. Bloom's performances also seem even more strangely relegated to the background, while any character (Davy Jones in particular) that is the result of intense special effects gets A LOT of focus. To my mind, this is just an abuse of special effects in this series. I found myself longing for the days when special effects were used to highlight, illuminate, and intensify an already exciting presentation. To be fair - let me state that, in general, I find that I have stopped going to movies that receive great press for ""special effects"". I used to really enjoy brilliant special effects, but I've come to prefer blockbusters that showcase the acting skills of the lead actors above all else. In this regard, Ms. Knightley's performance does not disappoint. It seems as though she is given, and takes good advantage of every opportunity to project the vibrant qualities of winsome ""pluck"" into every scene in which she appears. As such, for me her performance was perhaps the strongest amongst the heroes in the film. This was not nearly enough to save the movie-going experience for me, and I left feeling very tired, worn, and somewhat numb. No balm for said numbness comes from the fact that the esteemed viewer will leave the theater with no real plot resolution to speak of. The only thing missing here is a promotional sequence showing the trailer from the next movie to come (a la ""Back to the Future II), which one suspects may have been filmed at the same time and is now wallowing its way through post production. I suppose it would be too much to ask that they make the final cut for ""part 3"" much briefer, and brighten up the score with a lively ditty or two."

Of course you have the vintage Bill Nighy(Davy Jones), the beautiful Keira Knightley (Elizabeth) and the eunuch-looking Orlando Bloom(Will Turner) - but its Depp who grabs the eyeballs.<br/><br/>The story is in continuation with the first instalment and requires a preliminary knowledge about the first film. Captain Jack Sparrow, retrieving his ship The Black Pearl in the last film, is bound to pay a blood-debt to the legendary Davy-Jones(a grotesque face with dozens of spaghetti like things down his chin) or provide 100 souls in exchange. The plot turns a wee bit complicated when it is found that Sparrow, Turner, Comodore Norrington and Elizabeth are all after the same thing - Davy Jones' heart (hidden in a chest on some secluded island) , but all want it for different reasons.Davy Jones meanwhile unleashes The Kraken (a Balrog+Godzilla+King Kong like creature) on Depp. The film's ending is literally a jolt and ultimately leaves you hoping that Summer 2007 comes earlier."

Wait some months and see then all, beginning by renting a DVD copy.<br/><br/>The jokes are OK, Depp is great, lady Knightley barely seen - sad point, a tribe of Polynesian in the middle of Mexican Gulf (how?!?!), a lot of putrid seafood as makeup, a Jules Vernes plagiarism and so on.<br/><br/>I expected much more from the new Pirates and I left frustrated."
"Quentintarantado","8","3","5","24 July 2006"," My first Pirates movie
","I cannot say I like this over the first one since I only saw the ending of the first which was an agreeable entertainment. This one , I enjoyed despite its confusing plot and its length. Depp is as usual, priceless. Bloom and Knightley do well in action and witty quips rather than concentrate on their romance. I like Knightley for doing more than scream (yes she does here). It's the new characters that tickle my fancy. My favorite, of course, is Davey Jones. realistically rendered by ILM, Nighy creates a performance despite being virtually unrecognizable. He's a rascal who tore out his own heart because of love. He's a villain, a squid, a captain of a crew created by special effects (yet you forget they are effects; they each have unique characters) and he holds his own against Depp. That's why the picture succeeds. Davey Jones is perfect against Sparrow like Moriarity is perfect against Holmes or the Joker is perfect against Batman. Another bit I love is the triple sword fight between Sparrow, Norrington and Turner. There's the action between the 3, the physical comedy (all are after a key) and the switching of allegiances (who's fighting who and why actually changes mid-fight thanks to that rascal Sparrow). Selfless acts turn out to be betrayals and betrayals turn out to be purely acts of self-preservation. I'm interested in watching the first now, but I have a feeling (though it would round out what I know about them) I'm only going to be disappointed a little."
"justinbrown33","6","3","5","23 July 2006"," Overrated.
","This movie was too long, boring, and I'm tired of hearing about it.<br/><br/>They throw a lot of exhibitionary plot that ultimately serves no purpose in your face, right away, and then the rest of the movie is just silly situations -- most of which without a purpose.<br/><br/>For example: the entire sequence with the crew of the Pearl on the island with the natives. What was the point of that? Nothing was gained. They went ashore to avoid Davey Jones but, did we need a 25-minute excursion to see Johnny Depp prance around? Additionally, Jack Sparrow was a total douchebag in this movie; not like ""he's a rogue, he can be a smart-ass but he's not a bad guy"" either...he was an out-and-out jerk. He sends William right into danger. He then hits on Elizabeth. Why am I supposed to be rooting for him, again? Dialogue would give you a pretty good idea of what -- to an almost exact degree -- the next 15 minutes of story would be like and then those next 15 minutes would pan out exactly like you expected and it would just be boring.<br/><br/>You kept waiting for things to get interesting but they never did. It was a step-by-step story that never took any strange turns. In addition to telling you exactly where the story was going, it would very plainly tell you what was going on without telling you why it was really happening or why anyone should care. The story was weak, shallow, and while shallow movies can work very well (see: the first Pirates of the Caribbean film), this one was held together with popsicle sticks and Krazy Glue.<br/><br/>The lady in the Swamp was a great barometer of just how hard they tried to make this movie deep and vast but never succeeded. They travel to this distant place to talk to this lady and she just magically is able to tell our heroes what they need to know, what they need to get there, blah blah blah. She was a stepping stone and you couldn't even understand half of what she was saying.<br/><br/>The acting was fine but some of the effects were really lame (most of the Kraken effects and wide shots of the Davey Jones ship going underwater and surfacing), which was odd because they did a pretty great job on Davey and his crew's CGI-full faces...which, incidentally, were just showcases of ""look how cool we can make things with CGI!"". Those characters were boring but they Bedazzled them with effects so that you would at least take a second look at them.<br/><br/>Also, there was no reason to force Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley's characters back into this story. Their arcs ended with the first film (which was a self-contained story and when you make a first chapter without any intention of a second and third, you should not try to force all elements of the first into sequels); the way in which we were expected to believe they were back in Jack's story was really flimsy and boring.<br/><br/>Additionally, the reason this film is getting such incredible praise and doing extraordinarily well at the box-office is because everything else blockbuster-wise this summer has been a tremendous disappointment (X3, Mission Impossible 3, Superman Returns, The DaVinci Code, Poseidon, etc.). The critics saw this was probably their last real chance to grasp onto something and run with it, so they did. If you read some of the early reviews, before the movie opened nationally, you'll see that it got rather mediocre receptions at press screenings. It wasn't until the pirate geeks started raving about how AWESOME THE ENDING WAS (a real facade that basically says 'nothing is resolved at all but I don't want to question what just happened because I'll come off as stupid, so I'll say I like it') that people started embracing it.<br/><br/>If you're blind to anything involving pirates and cannot be objective, you'll disagree with everything I said but...honestly, this movie just wasn't that good.<br/><br/>(And people need to stop talking about the first one like it was Citizen Kane; it was a successful Jerry Bruckheimer summer adventure movie that, due to an absolute dearth of original ideas at Disney, was chalked up to have two sequels without there initially being any plan for such an endeavor.)"
"ama-34","6","3","5","23 July 2006"," Nice, but disappointing
","My understanding is that three movies were planned for the Pirates run, but this latest installment makes me think they only had enough script for two. So instead of just doing two movies, someone, other then the original writers, stretched out the first part of the script at the last minute. I don't know if this is true, but that is certainly what the movie felt like. <br/><br/>The first half-hour or forty-five minutes is rife with jokes from the last movie, or jokes playing on the jokes from the last movie, and they are sadly uninspired. This movie also features more, and more drawn out, fight scenes, that seem to do little more then eat up time. After a bunch of ill-thought out CGI sense, this part is over. Thank god. <br/><br/>Then the movie picks up! Lots of good stuff that you can see for yourself if you want. <br/><br/>The last halfhour the movie starts to die again with more loooonnnnngggg fight scenes and bad dialogue. But there are some good bits in this as well, especially a three way sword fight that is good for the first five minutes, but unfortunately goes for fifteen. What Jack does at the end is fitting, for the most part (even here I smell the stink of the producers touch), but the featured ending is not surprise. <br/><br/>In short, with some editing you would have the first half hour of a good sequel to the first movie, maybe someone will try that in the directors cut."
"aarontp-1","3","3","5","22 July 2006"," Complete letdown
","Its such a shame that a movie with such a big licence fails to deliver the goods. The 1st (curse of the black pearl) was a good film. No 2 is not so good. Don't get me wrong the special effects are excellent but the overall feel of the movie was messy with ""let's plonk this here"" and ""that would be a good idea to put that bit in the film here"" attitude and it didn't cement together. It was a long movie and some pointless sections could easily have reduced the running time. This is obviously flogging the movie licence to print merchandise money for the big studios which it will. I am not feeling the ""Hollywood"" touch in this movie and for a big blockbuster you would expect it. Johnny Depp is quality and any part he plays he shines, that is the only thing that kept the film alive. If you have the choice watch Superman returns instead as that definitely has the ""Hollywood"" touch."

","Though a wholly entertaining flick, Dead Man's Chest was not The Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>It seems as though Pirates 2 is going as most sequels go: SPECIAL EFFECTS, SPECIAL EFFECTS, SPECIAL EFFECTS, instead of a gripping plot. But don't get me wrong, Dead Man's Chest has a good plot dealing with revenge, Captain Jack's self-serving nature, and Turner's save-Elizabeth and save-everyone else complex.<br/><br/>The main thing I noticed that bugged me was Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow was it was just a bit different than in the first installment.<br/><br/>As a whole, it's a movie to see, but see it on the big screen.

Johnny Depp is reprising his role as expected... A drunk pirate that moves around as if he had Cerebral Palsy, however, Orlando Bloom isn't doing quite as well.. I never was a huge fan of him, but he does a decent job as a swashbuckling pirate that forgot to buckle his swash...=) Keira Nightly is just as believable as Depp in my opinion. She was interested in Piracy in the first film, and she Tris to live it in this one. All of the other actors are also impressive. Bill Nighy is a fantastic Davy Jones, along with many of the Flying Dutchmen. A 8/10 <br/><br/>All in all, this movie is the best movie of the Summer.

"jon2005","7","3","5","15 July 2006"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","When Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was released in the summer of 2003, it was a breath of fresh air in the world of blockbusters, managing to be light-hearted and fun, whilst adding a touch of horror and buckets of humour. Unfortunately, Dead Man's Chest has taken the route of many sequels; disguise the fact that it is not fresh anymore by making it look prettier. And that is probably the best way to sum Dead Man's Chest. It's not a bad film, but it's certainly not as good as the first.<br/><br/>Most of the cast have returned, and this is actually one of the films' problems. At the end of the first film the cast had all separated, and so the sequel needs to find ways to bring them all back together again, and this results in a plodding first half hour which mounts up as episodic and badly thought through plot devices. Even Commodore Norrington returns, and his entrance and role in the film, whilst is interesting in its own way, is (at least for the moment) needless. Also needless are the return of Ragetti and Pintel as the (unnecessary, given the fact that Jack Sparrow is the source of all the humour) comic relief, who really aren't that comic at all.<br/><br/>The point about Norrington brings up the next big fault. As it is the first part of the two sequel story, Dead Man's Chest is not a film that can stand up on its own; it is only half a story. This may mean that come May 2007, all the various plot points will make sense, but at the moment they are all too far-stretched to makes a whole lot of sense. There are also really too many different plot strands to last its two and a half hour running time (which is itself about half an hour too long).<br/><br/>There are good points about the film, of course. The effects are nothing short of staggering (although some of the fishy crew of the Flying Dutchman are not quite as good as the rest), especially Bill Nighy's Davy Jones who has a multi-tentacled beard. Nighy himself is good in the role, but Davy Jones never seems as menacing or, quite frankly, as good as Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. Also good is Stellan Skarsgård as Bootstrap Bill, Will Turner's father. Will is a little darker but Orlando Bloom lacks the gravitas to pull off such a character turn. Knightley's Elizabeth Swann is also different, showing a more pirate side to her actions, at least making her a little more exciting even if Knightley herself doesn't entirely convince.<br/><br/>The star is once again Depp's Jack Sparrow; even though, like the whole film itself, his act is not as fresh, he is given enough to work with so that most of the humour he creates lands well. His entrance is another classic moment, and his ability to run away as well as he can swagger is often hilarious  he even manages to build on his role from the first film.<br/><br/>There is plenty of action, and although it can be thrilling, it feels a little too over-the-top to truly impress at times. However, much of it is well handled, and injects a little more fun into proceedings, just when the audience begins to think that the film has begun to take itself too seriously to be fully enjoyable. It is now down to film number three to see whether the franchise is strong enough to stay afloat; the last ten minutes of Dead Man's Chest has three plot twists that at least will make us come back for the answers next summer. Overall, whilst it is enjoyable enough, it is certainly not a patch on the first, and the third entry in the series has a lot of work to do to restore audience faith in it.<br/><br/>Rated: 7/10 <br/><br/>More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"
"thefeds340","5","3","5","15 July 2006"," My MA Vacation Film
","I was vacationing is Cape Cod for the past week, and (God bless me) I was looking for a movie in which I could go to and make stubborn, goofy remarks about (in other words, mocking). Well, some other family members went along with me, and it was the day after Pirates had been released -- Saturday -- that we decided to *see* Pirates; I expected a lot, or at least more than I got -- but more on that later. So much to my avail, we went to see this long-awaited movie ... at a drive-through. I'm *never* one to complain, but ... I'll never go to a drive-through again for various reasons.<br/><br/>Now onto the good stuff, because you don't care about *that*. ^^^^ This movie started out dramatically, just as I knew it would. With actors like Bloom and Depp, how could it not? The first fifteen minutes were actually well done, and set up the story well for those who had mistakenly not seen the first Pirates, as well as Pirates fans. The film begins with Elizabeth and William marrying; happy happy. Of course this movie couldn't start with a happy event (very predictable, if you will) if the film was about Pirates and and some dude named Davy Jones. A problem occurs -- one in which I will not say -- and the two are unable to marry. This all takes place in approximately ten minutes. The scene switches, and eventually it gets to Jack Sparrow, whom I think was over-dramatic in his role. He is introduced in the only really comical part in the film (where the theater is an uproar of laughter), so don't expect anything very funny about Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>As the story went on, my rating dropped. I suppose I'm the dumb person and I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, but this storyline was *bad*. I mean, the first Pirates had a surprisingly good story, but the sequel ... ugh, Gore, I think you just messed up. Maybe it was because I saw the film in a noisy drive-in, I don't know.<br/><br/>The creature effects were good, but not realistic. I'm not into the whole computer generated effects in movies, because most of the time it looks incredibly fake. This movie proves my point. If you're a big Pirates fan, this probably won't bother or occur to you, so you needn't agree with me.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the sword action in the first movie, and it was ooook in the sequel. The spinning wheel dueling as shown in some of the trailers was kind of ridiculous. But the part I hated most in the movie was Depp's plunge from a cliff; he smashed through bridges on his free-fall, and landed on hard earth. God, couldn't there be a lake or something below?? What the hell is this? There wasn't even a crater in the earth. Of course, he just groans and gets up -- it reminded me of something from those ridiculous television wrestling matches.<br/><br/>Apart from all this bad stuff that I wrote, and a poor ending, Pirates *did* have some potential. You probably think I wrote too much crap, but the story had its ups and downs. The action was pleasing, and there were some funny parts. I think that if you liked Black Pearl, you should see this movie. If you haven't seen the first, then watch it, and see if you think a sequel is worth your while.<br/><br/>Lukus"
"lordelm3lmeen","7","3","5","14 July 2006"," not worth the hype
","this movie is good over all but the problem is that you go to movies like pirates of the Caribbean expecting a certain standard and wen the movie doesn't deliver it becomes disappointing. my guess is pirates wont stay on top of the box office come next weak. the movie takes along time to get down to business. almost the entire first hour of the movie has nothing to do with the story line (the story line is Jack sparrow finding the heart of Davy jones so that he can rule the sea) thats our story line forget any other thing like Jack's debt to Davy coz this is just a twist that helps the climax of the movie (introducing a third character that wants the heart) or will searching for jack to rescue Elizabeth as its just an excuse to get both will and Elizabeth to join jack on his magical trip! what Elizabeth does to jack at the end of the movie is motiveless. so to some it up the storyline is a bit troubled. my favorite sequence in the movie is when jack, will and that other captain are all fighting on this huge wheel its just out of this world. and a tribute to Mr. depp for his excellent performance. i mean i cant understand how some one can act as a pirate then go on to do three very different roles (finding neverland, Charlie and the chocolate factory and corpse bride) then goes to do the same pirate keeping exactly the same looks , voice tone its unbelievable. i think in the future we'll compare Johnny Depp's career to Robert De niro."
"ravenmosher","9","3","5","12 July 2006"," What a barrel of fun
","Once again Gore Verbinski has out done himself. Has he become the modern day George Lucas? He's left us hanging by a thread, giving Dead Man's chest the dreaded Cliff Hanger. And we have to wait till May next year to find out what happens! Dead Man's chest is full to the brim with action and cartoon like comedy. If there was anything bad to say about this film, it was that there wasn't enough character interaction for all the action. If this series of movies is indeed going to end as a trilogy, I predict it is going to be like this; First film is introduction to characters, second film is the climax, third is the closing. While the first could perfectly;y well stand on it's own without the sequels, the next two would be nothing without the first. The viewer would need to know the first film quite well to follow the sequel. The plot is fast moving, almost squashed in to 2 and a half hours, and perhaps there are too many plots to keep track of, but Verbinski makes up for this with the comedy. If a complex plot pops up, one of the characters would simplify it with a sarcastic comment, exactly the same as the first movie. The acting was choppy, and it is obvious Kierra Knightly has matured quite a lot since the first. Orlando seemed to have picked up some of Johnny's quirky movements, and Bill Nighy was...well, just Bill, even with all that makeup and CGI covering his face. Although these films are aimed for children, as is every Disney film, there is something in it for everyone. Especially in the Character of Captain Jack Sparrow. He is, as Johnny Himself is, a big kid who just wants to have adventures, and will do anything, even burn his wrist with candle wax to get out of trouble. We all have a bit of that in us. That's why we relate to this character. Davy Jones was a much better villain than Barbosa, but Geofry Rush is a better actor in my opinion as Bill Nighy. Rush just has that sneer, will Bill just has that weird slurpy speech. The special effects were astounding. It just transports you to this fantasy world that seems so real you have to pinch yourself every time that giant squid that resembles Karimdis from Greeth myths attacks the ships. This thing was terrifying, especially when Jack stared right into it's enormous house sized tooth carpeted mouth. Whether you're into action, adventure or just out to have fun, you will enjoy this movie. Even if pirates annoy you, there is something in this movie for everyone. Just watch the first one the knight before you see it and you will be fine."

","I just got home from watching the new Pirates movie tonight with my family. It was so much fun. This second movie had more funny moments, but also still was able to make me cry and jump in my seat from getting scared! The acting was superb. I cannot believe that two and a half hours could go by so fast. It was amazing. We took our 9 year old son and there was a few times that he ""hid his face"" but mostly it was okay. Some of the scenes were intense and so I do not know if the movie would be okay for most fourth graders. But he laughed along with the rest of us and thoroughly enjoyed it. Over all I highly recommend this movie for those who love the swashbuckling fun, the laughter, the adventure, and of course the romantic slant of the Pirates movies. It was so enjoyable, I will probably go see it at least once again in theaters. The only other movie that I have gone back to the theater for was Spiderman 2!

","Johnny Depp does it again in the second installment of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest. In this movie there is a lot more action and funny moments for the younger kids in the group. Jack Sparrow(Depp) has a debt to pay to Davy Jones and Davy is not forgetting that he owes it. So you follow the whole crew on the black Pearl to settle the debt of Davy Jones! You will find out though if you like Johnny Depp you may be disappointed because of the lack of screen time that he receives. It is more of Orlando Bloom and finding out that his father Bootstrap Bill Turner is aboard the Flying Dutchman(Ship that Davy Jones Captins.) and he is there for service. When Will(Bloom) finds out that his own father is on the ship he plays a game that will bet on how many years that you have to serve on the Flying Dutchman. Will bets a lifetime of service but his father takes his place. The outcome was devastating to Will because father had to spend a lifetime on the Dutchman in his sons place. he then goes and finds jack where the story really starts to heat up. So go out to the theatres and spend time on this great family movie from Disney."

The title is very suited to the movie, not only because it is about the ""Dead Man's Chest"", but also because it gives a sense of secrecy and uncertainty. It gives an ambiance or atmosphere of that of a pirate. Jack Sparrow is more focused on, but he is still the pirate that everybody fell in love with in ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"". Elizabeth Swann shows more of a pirate's personality, and she is waiting to marry William Turner. But what will become of their engagement when Elizabeth and Jack share a passionate kiss... and Will sees it?? <br/><br/>If you watch just one movie this summer,make it ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest""; it is definitely worth it!I am highly anticipating the third one!"
"art_freak304","10","3","5","10 July 2006"," Wow
","I love the multi-cliffhanger ending!!!! It was crazy.....best line in the movie, ""Look, an undead monkey"" Lmao. I however think the fact that Elizabeth with the compass kept pointing at Jack purely meant that she longs to be a pirate like Jack says. I cannot wait to see how she resolves the issue of being seen kissing Jack by Will.....Lucy, you have some splaining to do. As for the whole Barbossa thing at the end, I thought it was cool but kinda a stretch. I am really glad that the teaser at the end was about the dog. I was horrified by the fact that they were going to eat the dog!!! Now on to the graphics...splendid. I thought they were some of the best graphics I have ever seen although at some times the sea people were so detailed that I couldn't make out detail...does that make sense? Anyway love, love, loved it and will be first in line for the third one!"
"diac228","9","3","5","10 July 2006"," Dead Man's Chest revives hope in the movie industry as it delivers action, humor, horror, a fun story, and more Sparrow
","Who's up for another ghost tale involving the seven seas, pirates, the undead, and the forever cursed? Dead Man's Chest is a heavily hyped sequel to the original surprise hit that restarted the average moviegoer's love for swashbuckling adventures and also introduced us to Jack Sparrow, one of the coolest movie characters to come out in recent years. Most of the cast from the original came back, and this time the franchise was going to branch out into a trilogy. While the film clocks in at a long 150 minutes, Dead Man's Chest has so much going for it that you will not mind, even if the pacing is not that of the typical popcorn flick.<br/><br/>The pace of the original Pirates movie starts out slow and then speeds up especially towards the end. Dead Man's Chest does this same thing, except its even slower in the beginning, and then really picks up in the middle and ends with you gasping for air after all the disbelief and unbelievable moments shown on the big screen. The story this time centers on Jack Sparrow as suddenly his time to end his debt with Davy Jones, a very-feared and legendary captain of an evil ghost ship, is running out. With this dilemma at hand, he once again brings Will and Elizabeth into the adventure, as well as some familiar faces from the original. In the meantime, conspiracies and mysterious circumstances are brewing up in Elizabeth and Will's homeland. The plot is much more constricted and tangled up the second time around, even though the writers were able to add some seemingly unnecessary scenes for some comic relief.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp seems to be born to play the part of Jack Sparrow, because he does it so well, perhaps too well for his own good. He is just as funny, just as entertaining, and just as cruel and unusual in the second installment, as we get to see much more of him. Knightley and Bloom were not half-bad as the love struck victims of the entire ordeal, and while Bill Nighy is most certainly no Geoffrey Rush, not even close, he does a good job as the fearful captain. Unlike the average summer flick, the acting was decent, not Oscar-worthy (besides Depp), but passable. When the actors are not talking, its all the action-packed sequences and spectacular special effects that fill the screen. Without a doubt, some of the best-looking effects in recent years are displayed here, ranging from the disgusting-looking pirates, the Flying Dutchman itself, and the sea monster that gets summoned a few times. Davy Jones looks menacing and the staff does a great job in not overdoing the special effects and CGI.<br/><br/>While the action may have been lacking in the beginning, its everywhere in the second half of the movie. The first half was the introduction to the conflict and to the enemies in the movie; the second half is everyone going at it, whether it's a ship against a monster, or a three-way fight, or pirates against an invincible crew of damned souls, or a silly humorous fight amongst a bunch of drunk pirates and convicts. While Dead Man's Chest is not for mindless action fans, the second half has so much carnage and swordplay and unbelievable moments that it will make the average fanatic drool with anticipation for the next big moment. The three-way fight hands-down is one of the best action sequences you will ever see, guaranteed. Starting with just three people going at it, it escalates into amazing lengths, as Gore Verbinski stretches a simple fight into a complex turn of events with fun twists and never-ending fights between the hero of the story, the main character, and a third person who will not be mentioned in this review.<br/><br/>Like the original, Dead Man's Chest has a bit of everything: plot twists, action, humor, horror, drama, romance, and a lot of fantasy. The best part is, it has plenty of nods to the original movie, and plenty of references to the ride as well, and even to older literature. Has a bit of everything for the average viewer to enjoy, and while it is most certainly the most violent thing to garnish the Walt Disney name, it still has that bit of Disney magic that has made us return to Disney films time and time again. It is a ride through the open seas as you get to see it all, beautiful women, evil villains, colorful characters, huge monsters, treasure, and more stories to keep your thirst for nicely-woven sea tales quenched until next year, when we see the grand finale. Oh, the ending to this movie was grand as well, with a few pleasant surprises.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Not as fresh as the original, but just as entertaining, as it has a bit of everything, and more Jack Sparrow. Action, comedy, drama, and a hint of horror, Dead Man's Chest is in every way a good film, as it stacks up well to the original, and to action sequels in the past. This is quickly gaining potential in becoming the best action franchise since the masterpiece Indiana Jones movies of the 1980s. Recommend to everyone, and as long as you can put up with the slow pacing, you will not leave the theater disappointed. Dead Man's Chest: More Sparrow, more pirates, more fun, and more reasons to look forward to the 2007 summer movie season."

","When I say fantastic, I mean crap. This movie was ridiculous. It was so god awfully long for no other reason than to give it that ""epic"" feel that I seriously contemplated walking out in several places. The best part about it was the guy in front of me who ate it up. He was laughing at all the parts he was supposed to laugh at, he was tense and excited when peoples' fates were uncertain, and he was very satisfied at the ending and exclaimed how he couldn't wait to see the third one after his standing ovation. It's kind of charming to see people who allow themselves to be that into something. In fact his gasps of horror and joyous guffaws were the only reason I did stick around until the end.

","Just before their wedding, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are arrested by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) for helping the pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), but Cutler proposes a deal to Will: their freedom per Jack's compass. Meanwhile, Jack is afraid of the sea, because he owes his soul to the evil Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the Captain of the Flying Dutchmen. When Will meets Jack, the pirate proposes to exchange his compass by a key owned by Davy Jones. Will goes to the Flying Dutchman without knowing how dangerous and diabolic Davy Jones and his crew are.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is another good supernatural adventure of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, with action, humor, romance, mystery and great special effects. The story is inferior to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", but is also very entertaining. Unfortunately it is does not end, actually it is interrupted in a suspenseful moment in order to have another sequel again with Captain Barbossa. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Piratas do Caribe  O Baú da Morte"" (""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Death Chest"")"
"Surecure","6","4","8","2 January 2007"," If you like the first, you'll like this... if you didn't like the first, you still won't like this
","The Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is certainly geared towards those who are happy to see the same thing over and over again. Anyone going into these films expecting to see something truly new and unique is going to be sorely disappointed. I had heard the hype over the first film and was not overly impressed with it. It was fun, true enough. But, it wasn't an amazing film by any stretch of the imagination.<br/><br/>So, too, is the second film not a great film in any regards. It has its fun parts mind you, but it is nothing new, nothing unique, and falls prey to rehashing the same action sequences over and over again. I don't know how many times we need to see Orlando Bloom parlaying an action sequence either on top or inside of some round, rolling obstacle... but when you have the main character in a ball made of bones, on a net full of gunpowder and on top of a water wheel all in the same film, you know the writers are running out of ideas fast.<br/><br/>What truly annoyed me about this film was the fast and cheap setup at the end for the sequel yet to come. There was no sense that this film resolves anything or even ends a narrative path. Instead, it leaves the story hanging just as any of the previous action scenes did. In truth, for how little this film resolves anything, it could have ended anywhere and achieved the same result in terms of the story coming to a conclusion.<br/><br/>At least with other films that mandate a sequel, there is some sense of closure in the story lines. Even the second Lord of the Rings film had several plot resolutions, though the ultimate story had yet to finish. This film concludes nothing, and in that it feels like I wasted two and half hours, which is far longer than this type of film can sustain any semblance of relevance. By one and half hours I was already bored, but by the time the film ended with what was not even an ending, I was sick to death of the same things over and over again.<br/><br/>All in all, the second film is full of the same silly humor, rehashed action scenes and forced character development as the first. So, if that is your thing, all the power to you. But, if you are looking for something new or to stir the mind and imagination, this is not it. I like silly humor (I even loved Snakes on a Plane) but this film simply isn't interesting enough to reward the attention it deserves."
"All_The_Ens","6","4","8","20 August 2006"," Good, but not ""avast"" lot of Character Development
","OK, first of all allow me to excuse myself for the terrible pun in the title. I just felt like it.<br/><br/>Now on to ""POTC 2"". Well i thought it was good. That's it. Good but not great, and definitely not deserving of it's record box office haul. But if people like it, then who am I to say otherwise.<br/><br/>How could Gore Verbinsi treat us to so much in the first instalment ""Curse Of The Black Pearl"" and then give us so little in plot and character development in Dead Mans Chest. I'll say no more of that, i feel i've already said enough The saving grace of this movie is the Special Visual Effects. WOW!!! they get a 10/10 rating all on their own. ILM has done a fantastic job. You wouldn't believe that Davy Jones and his crew of Sea Phantom's were all Digital. Simply Superb.<br/><br/>So a massive round of applause and cheers to John Knoll and all the crew at Industrial Light and Magic, But jeers overall to this not so great sequel to a bonafied classic. It's good all round entertainment, But never will it bear the title of being a ""hollywood classic"".<br/><br/>Still bring on POTC 3. Maybe that'll be better... I can only hope."
"JoeJames76","5","4","8","17 August 2006"," Dead Man's Chest comes up dead. Leave this one at the bottom of the ocean.
","The immediate thought that ran through my mind after seeing this film, (after 'Thank God that's over!"") was how much i felt like when i had seen ""The Matrix Reloaded"". After being completely taken by surprise and blown away by the originality and complexity of the first, original film, i felt completely let down, confused, and saddened by how that first film is tarnished by this sequel.<br/><br/>Now, of course, in hindsight, i can appreciate the second Matrix film as a worthy installment of the series, and perhaps filled with the most rewatchable fight scenes of the entire trilogy. Hopefully, the same will be said about this film once all is said and done. Yet, for the time being, it seemed as though ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is more said, than done. My initial feeling is that it sucked the life out of the original, spat back the enjoyable lines and character references, and created a ridiculously complex back story that makes it incomprehensible with its laboured pace and unsatisfying faux ending.<br/><br/>Which is the problem of the second installment of pre-planned trilogies. It's almost as though the filmmakers hold back, knowing they have to save something for the final film, or else why bother? (Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers notwithstanding). Which, in response i say, why bother with a middle chapter if it's going to be so unfulfilling? Johnny Depp's role as Captain Jack Sparrow is still as much fun to watch as it probably is for him to act out. But his place in the movie as the bonafide hero takes a bit of the edge away which made him so dastardly to cheer for in the first film. What this film lacks is the presence of a real great villain, as Geoffrey Rush is sorely missed during the film. Both Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann seem like mere window dressing, as they try to cram as much cast from the first film that it makes more seem like less.<br/><br/>Much like the second Matrix film, this film will most likely be remembered for its excellent action sequence, mid-way through the film. Yet, by then most of the audience will be just as turned off or tuned out as Depp's inspiration, Keith Richards. This isn't a plot line that's too complex because it's so brilliant. It's a plot line that takes so long to develop that it becomes too laboursome for the audience to care less. Just give us the popcorn movie experience we loved so much the first time around.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like a bad movie spoof, this film is too full of repeated remarks and familiar circumstances, and not enough fresh, fun thrills. i wish i had Adam Sandler's remote from ""Click"" so i could fast forward half this film, and then on to the third one, where they must be storing all the fun and excitement this one left behind. Not enough booty to salvage this one from the depths.<br/><br/>Grade: C-"

The ending simply says ""If you are, by chance, as retarded as we think you are, and if you are not yet convinced that we will make sure that the third will be at least as plain as this one, here is a stupid reason to see third pirates"" The ending, if it was an ending, was just a last and glaring manifestation of the fact that the director, the producers, and the actors of PoC 2 are unbelievably cynical about their job.<br/><br/>I would like to warn the potential audience: Please don't waste your time and money."

","The Pirates of the Caribbean history is about rotten corps, rum, treasures and of course - pirates. Maybe the first movie contained many of these facts but number two only gets to rotten and to much rum. The first one is a masterpiece if you compare it with this crap.<br/><br/>First out, on of many, big disappointments - Orlando Bloom. Orlando Bloom is more awkward then ever when he through out his lines exact from the ms, where are the feelings.. where are the acting Orlando? Maybe he should talk to Woody Harrelson about a name change. He starts to feel like Ben Affleck, and that isn't a good sign. <br/><br/>Keira Knigthley is OK, until she starts yelling and just turns herself to pathetic. I read that the movie was like a living h*ell to record, and that feeling is also in the movie. It feels just like an movie. ""Do this, say that!"" And nothing more. And, unfortunately, Keira belong to that crowd of actors.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow where just one of a kind in the first part, but now he just feels goofy and nag. He tries to be funny bit through the whole movie, and that's 2,5 hour.. I didn't laugh once! Many of his moves was predictable and I'm not enjoying a movie when I can tell the story to myself before I see it one the screen for the first time. It feels like they use the Jack Sparrow character in the second movie, just because he succeed in the first one. Like, why changing a winning concept? Well, if you turn a a good concept and character to bad, it drag also the first part down with it in the fall. I'm not sure that I can watch the first one again, without get annoyed on Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>I would prevail you not to watch this movie, even if you have seen the first one.. if it wasn't for number 3. But if that sucks too... this is just waste of time and money. But, if you aren't going to see number 3. Then you can stop with have seen number one. It contains a good story, good ending and some interesting characters. This one however, is just ""a movie"" with nothing to offer.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes my vote go up to 3 instead of 1... is the crew under Davy Jones command and himself. But without the daily technology, even that would have sucked."
"MartianOctocretr5","6","4","8","5 August 2006"," Pirates plunder old plot elements in this Dead Man's Chest
","Let's see: long lost father in league with the dark side, an evil emperor (of the high seas instead of the galaxy), a maverick soldier of fortune captain who cares only about himself, sword fights (instead of light sabers), a love triangle developing, a second installment that is just one long set-up for a concluding third installment, a character apparently dies but is strategically positioned for resurrection, etc...This sounds like a been-there-done-that situation.<br/><br/>I guess part 3 will introduce some fish that resemble mini-me-Wookies that help fight Davy Jones. The guy and the girl will find out they're brother and sister? Will they start saying ""May the Caribbean Sea be with you, says I, maitee"" and then make 3 prequels? Fill in your own Star----oops, I mean, Pirates plot twists here.<br/><br/>Overall, it's an OK movie, but with some flaws. Johnny Depp was brilliantly dashing yet devious in the original as Capt. Jack Sparrow, and has made this character part of our cultural lexicon. However, the awkward scripting this time on how Sparrow evolves is a challenge even for Depp's talents. Unnecessary action is thrown in, apparently to pad the running time, so that you don't notice this whole thing is just a commercial for part 3. The entire chase scene with the island natives means nothing in the story line. The free-for-all-mayhem where several characters just start fighting over stuff at the end has too much slapstick; the 3-way sword fight and the odd way it is shown are almost too much to endure.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you prefer a film that has loads of action, you'll love the pace of this movie. The ship-to-ship engagements are not bad at all, and the Kraken's ""Moby Dick"" style appearances are highlights of the flick. The Flying Dutchman creatures are also very creative, but their design is almost comic relief, rather than scary, in nature.<br/><br/>A half-hearted thumbs-up on this one. The movie's strong points outweigh the weaknesses. However, this movie is shallow compared to its predecessor, and I hope the installment that it spends a lot of time pointing to is better than this, as well."
"sinncross","7","4","8","4 August 2006"," Two pirates lives for me...
","It's not everyday that a movie based upon a Disney theme-park ride, is created, and even rare is that such a movie would gain a sequel. However, the days of humorous pirates has been given new life with the sequel to one of the most enjoyed movies to date; Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has finally arrived in port.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest continues soon after the ending of its predecessor, yet all is not well. Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and Will (Orlando Bloom) are set to be married, but their past dealings with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), has caused both to be deemed criminals. However Will can right his wrongs, and save Elizabeth from death, if he can meet up with Jack, and return with Jacks compass. Jack on the other hand is tied to death itself, as he has a debt to pay to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy).<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest is a whole other beast to the original. Where as The Curse of the Black Pearl was a lighthearted film filmed with humour, Dead Man's Chest sidelines much humour in favour of some dark and intense scenes. In fact, there's nothing in the first half, which remotely resembles Pirates of the Caribbean's awkward yet fun self. It's moody and dark, and contains nothing in value of laughter. It's only till the film begins reeling the second half, does the charm of the original begin to be realized, and it's far better the original too.<br/><br/>Acting is once again top-notch but there's not enough Jack. With trailers seemingly shouting Jack all over this movie, Dead Man's Chest actually centres more on Will. This isn't entirely a problem as the story does entail Will to have more screen time, and the ending suggests that it was worth it. Davy Jones deserves a mention as being a cruel villain, but he's never evil enough for the part he plays. There are also many references to the past movie, which really adds depth, and in part humour, to the characters.<br/><br/>Another redeemable quality of Dead Man's Chest, is that the editing problem of the first, has now been corrected, and the film has a better flow to it. This could however be because of some incredible fighting scenes, which really brings the whole concept of pirates and the world they lived in, to breathtaking life. Yet, it's a tad dark for the overall experience.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, plays a fine line of dark moments, with light moments, yet never comes close to achieving this balance. Both are almost two separate parts, where as The Curse of the Black Pearl, still had some light within it's 'dark'. The first half is a letdown, and never achieves what the original created, but the second half is a wonder to watch, and will have you laughing in no time. The films closing scene points to the ending of the trilogy, and with a better focus on balance, the final Pirates of the Caribbean, can be funny and intense at the same time, thus washing away the inconsistency of Dead Man's Chest."

","Once again, Johnny Depp needs to call on his powers as one of the great actors of his time to save this gigantically overblown sequel to part one of the Pirates franchise. The stunts are great. The jeopardy scenes are inventive. The costumes are spectacular. But where's the plot? An hour into the feature and we've seen a host of quality action and choreography to go with Keira Knightley's heaving bosom, Orlando's pouting and Depp's masterful Cockney lecher's leer, but it feels like five short action features one after the other with nothing holding them together. One review of this movie I saw noted it was five minutes longer than Goodfellas, and pointed the question as to what might be gained as a viewer from this as a result as opposed to taking in the Scorsese masterpiece. Cut it down to 115 minutes and you've got a quality pop blockbuster the audience can go home from brushing off the popcorn crumbs with all and sundry telling their friends how they can't wait for the last one, and plenty of good script ideas left over to use in the final instalment. Mind you, it always pays to stay till the end. I've never seen an actor steal a two and a half hour movie with his only line in a fifteen second scene, but well, it's all in a day's work for Geoffrey Rush."

","It looks like everyone used up their creativity and originality with the first one. The movie has the same basic plot (cursed sea crew after Sparrow - just think sea monsters), dire attempts for Jack to outwit them (which is really just a lot of melodrama, and gets pretty old) and of course, the heart breaking love story between Elizabeth and Will. Although, any surprises in this movie were ruined by poorly chosen scenes for previews. I can't imagine what happened when the actors read this tired script that reuses and makes puns of the great jokes from the first movie. It must have been hard for Knightly to pull some sort of consistency with Elizabeth. One minute she's holding a gun to a man's head and sword fighting, the next she's screaming her head off (for no apparent reason). I must give credit to Bloom though, he found 2 new expressions for this movie, and I was dazzled. Needless to say, I was a little disappointed with the writing, acting, and even the score. Maybe a few new bars here and there, or a key change, but that was the only difference. Obviously, the first wasn't intended to be a trilogy, and the plot turns just didn't make sense (a lot of the plot was just unnecessary time fillers for an already long film). The 2nd sequel out of 3 isn't always the best, but this was just a poor show."

It's kind of like drinking sour milk from the fridge, putting it back, and hoping that it will taste better in the morning! The whole saga of pirate movies, without a grabbing story, a real waste of time. I know the third one was filmed at the same time as the second one, seems Hollywood is confident that this one will sell like the other two, and it probably will.<br/><br/>One thing that really turned the sight of the movie off to me was the sight of rotting flesh. To others, this may be the best thing they've ever seen, but to me, it was as horrible as the movie! I live with too many stupid things, why do I need one-eyed pirates rotting to death, while being chased by human squid things that have no hearts.<br/><br/>On another note, if only the editor took about thirty to forty minutes out of the movie it might be watchable.

However, lucky for them, they forgot they had some ""fans"" who will defend the film vehemently, no matter what people say. I've seen people with perfectly legitimate opinions on the film get bashed by the so-called ""fans"", just for pointing out a negative aspect of the film.<br/><br/>And that is how this movie differs from the first installment. Whereas ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was a fun film that most people could find numerous things to enjoy, the second movie in the series seems rather long and dragged-out, characterized by (some) shoddy effects work and flat acting from some of the main characters.<br/><br/>However, I am willing to look past that if the film has a good plot. Unfortunately, this film did not. My biggest gripe with this film is that it basically ends in a ""to be continued""-type scenario that basically says to me ""we want your money for part three!"" And, unfortunately, they will not be getting mine. As an avid ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" fan who saw the first film seven times in theaters, the second film has greatly impacted my appreciation of the first movie. There were so many possibilities, yet it seems as if Disney decided to go for more action, sacrificing a good plot instead.<br/><br/>And, suffice to say, Disney will not be getting any money from me for part three."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl was one of those phenomenal films that hasn't come along since Star Wars: A New Hope, a rollicking, fun, summer adventure film that reinvigorates a genre and makes you want to go to the movies again. Well if Black Pearl is A New Hope then Dead Man's Chest is easily the new Empire Strikes Back. The film is darker, more violent, more frightening, and more cynical than the first, showing the side of piracy that was glamorized in the first. The backstabbing, the lying, the stealing, the double edged sword of morality is shown and the true pitfalls of the profession are revealed.<br/><br/>We start out on the wedding day of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, which has been interrupted by new chief villain Lord Cutler Beckett. Because of that little escape at the end of the first film where they allowed Capt. Jack Sparrow to escape Will, Liz, and Norrington (who has since left his position in the Royal Navy) are all under arrest. The only way Beckett will show mercy on these young lovebirds is if Will can retrieve Sparrow's compass. <br/><br/>Jack Sparrow however has different uses for the compass, he needs it to find the chest of Davy Jones (which holds his heart), and is the only thing that can help Jack call off Jones' monstrous Krakken from the Sparrow hunt. Will agrees to help Jack in return for the compass and what follows is a swashbuckling adventure that outdoes the first in both action, humor, plot, character development, and mystery. Do yourself a favor and return to a time when movies were fun, thought provoking, and left you wanting more by watching Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."
"datamanistatorn","9","4","8","24 July 2006"," Such an entertaining movie
","Well, well, well... what do we got here? A follow-up to the well-known Pirates of the Caribbean - The Curse of the Black Pearl, AND the very part of the forthcoming sequel of the Pirates of the Caribbean 3 (2007?).<br/><br/>The movie itself doesn't introduce any new characters than of course the bad-guy Davy Jones (some info of him to all you 'want-to-know-all' friends in Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Jones'_Locker) w/ his crew and some other major/minor characters.<br/><br/>The environment of the movie is quite much the same as in the first movie. Pirates of the Caribbean 3 is being presented by the same director and script writers as in The Curse of the Black Pearl, and does perhaps therefore have no major changes what occurs the environment, the script of the characters & plot and the way in how to capture the movie picture for to creating a more entertaining and exciting experience for the viewer.<br/><br/>This movie goes under the genre of Action and Adventure and I must confess that I'm quite pleased with those two words. The movie is presented with a suitable amount of action & adventure compared to nowadays films. Plenty of computer animation is scripted and the fantasy of the director is indeed shown with a nice style. So far a good movie.<br/><br/>What occurs the casting of the film's characters, I say that they all done well, especially Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy. In the opinion of mine, the The Lord of the Rings' co-star Orlando Bloom's casting was quite week. He wasn't emotionally enough approving to me, his personality was quite lame. But then of course, it was Johnny Depp who had the honor to enter the stage in the flashing stage-light. Keira Knightley acted her part well, I say. And Jack Sparrow, the drunken pirate-bugger, was funny enough for making me laugh. Still, his humor was somewhat childlike, but childish in a positive way ;). Go Captain Jack Sparrow! Finally I have to commend this movie for its fully entertaining 150 minutes where Disney w/ staff certainly has successfully made a movie of the life of the raiding pirates in the seas of the Caribbean. Thank you for that! Now I at least wait with great excitement for the coming sequel movie of the Pirates of Caribbean. And for you who haven't already seen this movie on the large screen, go to the nearest movie-theater and see it - it's worth seeing with a or some friends! Thanks for reading!"
"j_gamesmaster","10","4","8","24 July 2006"," A thrilling tale of Pirates, buried treasure...and the horrors of the sea
","Well, what can I say? Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest has made a tense, action-packed, scary, and devastating sequel to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" For a start, the locations are fantastic; not only was this film shot at such exotic places as St. Lucia, the Bahamas, St. Vincent and Granada; the film includes a wide variety of settings which are compulsory for a film about pirates; a tropical island with hostile natives, a filthy pub populated by drunkards (an ideal place for a riot scene), as well as a ghostly shipwreck.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are also great, or greatly developed from the first film such as Elizabeth Swann becoming skilled with the sword and the unfortunate new fate of Commodore Norrington. They even restored the two comical pirates, Pintel and Ragetti (Ragetti is the one with a false eye) from the first film, which I think is great, as they are two people who are, although evil, funny and lovable. There is also an ethnic Caribbean wise woman, who was clearly thought up with great imagination, as well as her home, in which Ragetti stands beside a hanging jar of eyeballs, here we see an example of hilarious surrealism. What I would say were especially intriguing though were the villainous phantoms of Davy Jones' crew; unlike in the first film, these monsters are actually themed with the sea, i.e. barnacles growing on the faces, crab's claws, squid tentacles. The other great thing about the crew is that they are all individually unique (again, unlike in the first film, in which they were all just skeletons); a member of Davy Jones' crew is not just one of many ugly monsters, but he has something special to show to the audience, one pirate for example has the head of a hammer-head shark, another has a head that comes off and is able to follow its body by becoming a hermit crab. The portrayal of Davy Jones furthermore speaks for himself, and has been gruesomely but skillfully made by the costume designer to stand out as the authority amongst his crew. The conceptual artists of this film had a very gifted imagination I must say.<br/><br/>The music score for the film is great, they kept the action theme tune from the first film, but added an extra 'B' part to the music, which, I think has been a success, as it sounds good and goes very well with the 'A' part. As I recall from one scene, as Captain Jack, Elizabeth Swann, Norrington, Pintel and Ragetti are walking across a vast beach towards the camera, the zoom focuses in quickly as significant beats of the music strike. I don't think I have seen this sort of correspondence before in a very instrumental, ""thick"" piece of film music, so I think the director Gore Verbinski was good in not being afraid to try something new. The script of the film is also brilliant and is very funny. Lines come up which you wouldn't really expect as well. These are too hilariously unexpected that I will not mention any examples (it will spoil the moment).<br/><br/>A few aspects of this film are comparable to Steven Spielberg's version of ""The War of the Worlds"", namely towering tentacles rising and swirling themselves high above ships crow's nests, snatching the odd extra and flinging them through the air now and then, and the dreaded roar of 'the Kracken' (The Scandanavian grim-reaper of the sea), who is comparable to 'the sarlacc' from ""Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi"" in a way with its infinite teeth circling its whole mouth. Believe me, Walt Disney knows what he's doing here, as they did a version of Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", which, as we all know contains a giant squid. The other great thing about the Kracken is that we don't see its whole body at first. The sight from a distance of enormous tentacles dragging down a helpless ship is enough to send a shiver down one's spine. Furthermore, we have a sense of overpowering mystery when we don't see the whole thing. We see it underwater briefly through the eyes of Will Turner as he watches the fate he brought upon an innocent merchant ship.<br/><br/>For thrill seekers, fun lovers and film lovers, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a god-send. Although it doesn't have all that much of a plot, it contains all the classic aspects of a true piracy film; a treasure map, buried treasure, chases, hostile island natives, sword fights and plenty of them, sword fights on top of big rolling wheels, a snifter of romance and drama, a crew of pirate monstrosities, and even a terrifying, tentacled sea monster! All of these aspects lead the audience to a thrilling climax, which gets the audience eating their popcorn quickly. Trust me on this, if you watch Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, your eyes will be glued to the screen! A film that I would recommend to everyone.<br/><br/>-Reviewed by James Ord in the United Kingdom"

","I had been excited to see this movie for months. I was a huge fan of the first one, having seen it at least 5 times in the theaters. This movie just adds to the fun. Captain Jack is just as mischievous and charming in this movie. I felt that there were more humorous moments in this movie, but some may disagree. If you haven't seen the first movie, some of the humorous moments will pass you by. There's a line about rum that's absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>As a mother of a 5 year old girl, I had no intentions of taking her to this movie. She has seen the first movie and loved it, but I was concerned about the images I saw in the previews. After seeing the movie, I was right not bring her. Davy Jones' crew is a bit on the creepy side and I wouldn't recommend this movie for children under the age of 9, and that's assuming they have strong constitutions. Other than the graphic violence and pirate images, the other daunting thing for smaller children would be the length of the movie. 2 1/2 hours a bit much to expect from a 7 year old <br/><br/>The surprise at the end was enjoyed and it makes you want to see the next movie even more. If you liked the first one, than I seriously doubt you'll not like this one."

The many different plots coming together was definitely what sets this movie apart, and what earns it a 10!

But, I know an equal number of people who say they LOVED it, so just go see for yourself!!

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is an awesome film! I would definitely have to say it is one of the best sequels ever made; better than your average sequel as a matter of fact. Will Turner (portrayed by Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) meet up with Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) once again. Jack has trouble coming his way: Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). The pirate has a debt to settle with Davy Jones, whom you could say is the pirate and sailor version of the Devil. If someone makes a pact with him, there is no escape. Even the great (and hot!) Jack Sparrow has a difficult time outwitting Davy Jones. This is a must-see! It has great action, comedy, and an interesting plot that makes you want to know what will happen next."

","Wow. Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest is the first movie I've seen in a long time that I didn't feel like taking my 8 bucks back after seeing it. I've been watching a lot of movies recently and they've all been sad disappointments. Not this one though. This film was funny, intense, emotional, and much better than the first one in my opinion. The writers deserve awards for the beautifully scripted storyline that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat as the main plot unfolds through a plethora of intriguing sub-plots. Every character wanted their own thing and while that may sound like a basic dramatic rule, many movies have lacked that recently (watch the movie to see what I mean). Excellently written characters were brought to life by phenomenal actors. We all love Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, let's face it, but Davy Jones was the best computer-animated character since Gollum in Lord of the Rings. I own the soundtrack which contains a palette of moods from deep-villainous organs to lofty circus music to tribal dance beats. Simply put, I have to thank everyone involved with this film. I am BEGGING for a third one. This movie definitely got me in to the pirate fever. Arrrr!!"

","I went extremely early to get in line for this movie. First in line to get in, and it was well worth the hour long wait.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a gruesome beginning, I don't really understand the whole reason, but just watching the first five minutes, you are just flown into the beautiful camera-work, as opposed to the first film, where the slightest move and the camera went shaky.<br/><br/>All the actors are amazing, beautifully portraying their characters, and so much detail into their personal lives. You learn secrets, betrayals, and loyalties during this movie, which leaves your head swimming by the time the credit rolls.<br/><br/>I must admit, I went and watched this movie again, trying to figure out exactly all that went on. Be ready to ""jump in"" and try to piece the puzzle together. This movie was very long, but very entertaining. It took another go for me to figure out all the details that the movie gave for this and the next film, but I will gladly suggest you go see it, if you haven't already.<br/><br/>The movie is a lot of good vs. evil, and there is a lot of religious symbolism, or at least I thought so.

"maiamelian","10","4","8","19 July 2006"," Dead Mans Chest - Empire Strikes Back
","Yes, I am making this comparison. However one rates the pirate trilogy and the Star Wars universe in relation to one another, the fact remains that as A New Hope (or Star Wars as it were) were a great and thoroughly entertaining space opera with a good and classic adventure, if not very complex, so was 'the Curse of the Black Pearl' the same thing as far as pirate movies were concerned. And then came Empire Strikes Back, and suddenly the feisty happy-ending mood of the predecessor proved to have been just the presentation of the whole setting, a skipping across the surfaces of deep, dangerous waters.<br/><br/>Exactly so with Dead Mans Chest. Which is why (being in my time a devout Empire Strikes Back-disciple) I declare this movie to surpass its predecessor, being darker, more complex and more evil, with considerably more character development, moments of doubt and nastiness, while at the same time being still as hysterically funny as the first. It shows right down to the editing and framing of the picture, which have clearly received more attention than the first. Yes, it is an adventure-story, and so the characters are in many ways archetypes. But they are interesting archetypes, and there are flesh on their bones. As per usual Johnny Depp just delivers everything one could have hoped for (can anyone remember a movie in which he doesn't?). I mean, the guy is just a genius, period. Keira actually impressed me a little in this one. She has definitely matured, and her Miss Swann is starting to behave in complex ways and having doubts and considerations in many directions. Orlando Bloom is a bit slower, but there is a refreshing self-irony in his performance as the Skywalkeresque Will Turner this time - probably also thanks to the writers who gave him a bit more to work with this time. Stellan Skarsgaard and Bill Nighy, being both accomplished actors, delivers the goods, but I must say that the greatest and most pleasant surprise came from Jack Davenport and the character-development of (now ex-commodore) Norrington. Being a woman I'll start in the primitive end of it and exclaim : my God, the guy is actually hot without that soft-ice-wig! But apart from that I was delighted in the extreme by the way which Davenport manages to show us a person who is still, stripped of his civilized finish, is STILL RECOGNIZABLY THE SAME PERSON (this coming to attention by e.g. his still very dry English gentleman-wits which somehow seems to be still left). Norrington-in-the-mud is definitely proving to be a much more interesting and deep guy than he let one in 'The Curse...' In a way he is the antrophomorphic illustration of the difference between that very movie and this one. The surface of the sea may look nice and blue but underneath, the Kraken awaits!"
"WriterDave","8","4","8","16 July 2006"," Top Notch Sequel
","""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" builds upon the good will of its fun natured predecessor with the typical ""bigger, better, more"" attitude of the standard blockbuster sequel. What's so refreshing, is that it actually delivers on the motto and gives audiences exactly what they want.<br/><br/>Unlike the first film, which benefited from originality and lengthy exposition to set up the action and humor, ""Dead Man's Chest"" gets off to a clunky start with the reintroduction of just about every character and theme both major and minor from ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" It makes for a somewhat confusing first hour, as I honestly hadn't watched the original since its theatrical run three years ago and didn't quite remember who everyone was and why they were in their current convoluted predicaments. Once the action gets going, and you settle into the preposterous plot that involves plenty of double-crossing, pillaging, tall tales from the sea, and some sort of hocus-pocus involving the mythical Kracken, the audience is treated to a visually stunning ride full of healthy doses of action, humor, and spookiness.<br/><br/>Once again, what makes the film stand out from the rest (aside from Johnny Depp's now iconic Jack Sparrow role) is how director Gore Verbinski handles the material and stages the freak show. He's probably the only commercially trained for-hire director who knows how to sustain a beautiful shot. It's also nice to see him get a little more artistic with his direction, as anyone who has seen ""The Ring"" or even odder his more recent ""Weather Man,"" will pick up on concurrent themes in his breathtaking visuals. More developed in this film is his classical take on dissolves and dolly shots that are nothing short of fantastic. With a bigger budget (upwards of $200 million) he's also one of the few big time blockbuster directors who makes sure every penny is seen on screen. The special effects were shockingly detailed and crystal clear, especially the insanely creative and unique look of the Davey Jones Crew and the aforementioned Kracken. The visual effects team has taken computerized images to new heights beyond even the superb work done with Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. The amazing effects dance across the screen hand in hand with sweeping natural vistas, brilliantly staged action sequences and elaborate sight gags (witness the human shish-ka-bob scene) that seem as equally inspired by old time Serials and the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy as they do by Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and other silent film classics. Despite sometimes the humor falling flat, this infectious combination of old-style film-making with new fangled state-of-the-art technology translates wonderfully into audience satisfaction and perfectly calculated box-office gold."
"harold_a_shaver","4","4","8","15 July 2006"," YO HO The Directors Compass Was Off
","The interaction between characters is what separates average movies from blockbuster movies that will be recognized through out movie history. Sometimes the simplest of plots develop the greatest opportunities for the actors to develop the characters and the greatest chance for the audience to develop a caring relationship for the characters on the screen. Examples: Rocky, Million Dollar Baby, Gladiator, and even Anger Management....you can relate to the characters.<br/><br/>The story meanders from fast paced action to anchor dragging segments that add little to the story.<br/><br/>The actors should be recognized for their outstanding performances that if they had not contributed we would have seen ""Heaven's Gate"" of the high seas.<br/><br/>This was not the magical summer popcorn eating joy ride that was Pirtaes 1. For me this was; lets take a movie give it literary legitimacy and build a long-term franchise for Disney. This is not Star Wars that built characters and plot lines that transcend generations.<br/><br/>I went to the theater 4 times to see Pirates 1 I loved the action combined with witty dialog and fresh characters.<br/><br/>CPT. Jack should have been the heart of the story line not Davy Jones' heart.<br/><br/>I hope anyone else seeing this movie does enjoy the experience and this review was not too negative."

","When I went to the first film on a whim I was expecting nothing and got everything. So, when I was expecting everything with the second and got nothing, I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised. Still, it's disappointing when such a long anticipated release falls so flat. I'll admit that I laughed at times - mostly because I felt I needed to on some level or a few around me were giggling - but upon further reflection, it was shallow laughter. The gags just didn't cut it, the characters seem to have lost their spark, and the plot didn't inspire much anticipation or excitement. Although it was nice to see the original players return, they just didn't seem themselves in this installment - trying too hard to relive the first I suppose. I was still much impressed with the authenticity of the setting, props and costumes, but I felt the special effects, although amazing at times, played too big a role and were rather overdone and distracting in a way that overshadowed what should have been solid acting performances with the wit and timing of familiar characters from the first. It reminded me of a comedian that has an off night. Still, I'll no doubt buy it on DVD to complete my collection, so hopefully the third will make up for it."
"FilmSchoolWriter","10","4","8","13 July 2006"," And The Rum is Back!
","I should probably put this out on the table right away: I'm possibly the biggest fan of Pirates of the Caribbean ever. Biggest fan as in: I know all the words by heart and I remember 99% of all the tidbits I've ever picked up. And it shows. End of story. Okay, now that I've got that out of the way, let me get on to reviewing POTC: Dead Man's Chest. I've read several newspaper reviews and most of them say the same thing, that although the critics enjoyed the movie, they found it to be rather rambling and they were irked by the ending (or lack there of). I can see the truth in what they say, but that doesn't mean I necessarily agree with it. Dead Man's Chest rocks. It's 150 minutes of pulse racing, jaw dropping, swashbuckling fun. How do I love thee? Let me count the ways:<br/><br/>+ Everyone has returned for a second time around on the ride. And I can guarantee you that this wouldn't work without the original cast and crew. Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio create another wonderful script for our enjoyment, full of the same enjoyable banter that we had the first time around. Many of the funnier lines are jokes that you will probably only get if you've seen The Curse of The Black Pearl, but that's not a problem in the slightest. {Jack's lines: ""Elizabeth! Hide the rum."" and ""I'm still rooting for you mate""; Elizabeth fainting to get attention; as well as the constant correction that it's CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow.} Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer return as director and producer respectfully; so the style is much the same, only a few shades darker. Hans Zimmer's score completely blows me away. It's not all brand new, which helps to link The Curse of the Black Pearl to Dead Man's Chest. The pulse racing music from the sword fights is redone, so that it's the same, but different. There are several scores using the organ, which adds this wonderful spine tingling atmosphere to the movie. A round of applause to whoever designed Davy Jones and his crew. And you thought that undead skeleton pirates were cool. If Dead Man's Chest is not nominated for Best Make-up at the Oscar's, it is a crime. + Captain Jack's back my friends. Johnny Depp delivers once again as the flamboyant, perpetually drunk captain of The Black Pearl. Some people may consider him to be TOO over the top, but I didn't see it that way at all. I doubt if he'll win a second Oscar nomination, but he's wonderful anyways. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner is much more self assured, and far less pathetic this time around. 99% pirate, we're almost there Will. Of our 3 main characters, Elizabeth is the one who's changed the most. She's learned to handle a sword, and she's much more independent. But man is she making the rounds! I have to say that by the end of Dead Man's Chest, I hate her  in the best way possible. Major snaps to Keira Knightley for her brilliant job. Not only does she deliver the most hilarious monologue in the movie, she's also an amazing swords-woman. Another brilliant return is Jack Davenport as the dethroned James Norrington. We encounter Norrington about half way through the movie, and he's no longer the prim sophisticated Commodore. Now he's a drunk, pot head, half out of his mind who's only wish is to regain what he's lost. Even going so far as to sign onto The Black Pearl. Kevin R. McNally's back as Mr. Gibbs and we love him. The gruffest, sweetest pirate around, he's wonderful. But the best performances would probably have to go to two new comers. Stellan Skarsgard and Bill Nighy. Skarsgard delivers as Bootstrap Bill Turner, one of the few crewmen of ""The Flying Dutchman"" who haven't lost their humanity. His performance as Will's father is touching and if you're sentimental like me, parts of it are down right heart breaking. But Bill Nighy steals the show as Davy Jones. He just looks astounding! His range is amazing. He jumps from a cruel captain to a broken hearted romantic in a second. I don't know if he's applicable for the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but I really hope he's nominated. + Just like its predecessor, the sword fights in Dead Man's Chest are spine tingling. If you thought that a sword fight in and out of the moonlight was cool, check out this three way sword fight  part of which takes place on a detached water wheel. It gave me chills.<br/><br/>I understand why some people may not be completely enthralled by this movie. Like all movies, it is flawed. But they don't detract from the finished project in the slightest. But here they are anyway:<br/><br/><ul><li>The movie does ramble and I suppose that it is rather long. The entire thing on the cannibal island  though entertaining  does nothing for the plot.

","When I found out they were making a sequel to my favorite movie ever, Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl, I was thrilled and yet frightened at the same time. It's no secret in Hollywood that sequels are usually pretty bad compared to the original movies. That was my fear for Pirates 2, all up until actually seeing the movie.<br/><br/>Reading the reviews before the movie, the critics were mixed about it. Some though better than the original, some though total waste of time. Yahoo's average critic rating was a B-, MovieFone's was a 52/100.<br/><br/>That helped sky-rocket my fear even more. Until I saw that MovieFone also gave Pirates 1 a 60/100. So I realized, what do they know? But going to see the movie allowed me to give my own opinion. And let me tell you, the movie DID NOT disappoint.<br/><br/>Most say the movie was somewhat slow in the beginning, I say it was character building. Most say the movie was too long, I agree it could have been shorter.<br/><br/>That's about it though. The movie had stunning special effects, great characters, more humor, and more Captain Jack than in the first movie, which after all is the reason we see it right? :) While the first is still better, the second is enjoyable, as long as you make your bathroom trip before the movie.<br/><br/>Some people say waste of time. I say look at it this way, if you walk into the theater expecting to be blown out of your mind by the amazing sequel to '03's hit, you will be disappointed. But if you enter the theater expecting to watch a movie based on a theme park ride (just like most did going to see the first), and...get this...have pirates in it, you will be satisfied.<br/><br/>Just my two cents ;)"
"Petio","9","4","8","13 July 2006"," Breath-taking movie, outstanding Johnny Depp
","When I saw the first movie I thought: Johnny Depp could get a nomination for this one. And so he did. When I saw the sequel yesterday I said to my friends: Depp deserves an Oscar for this wonderful performance! And I do believe it! You should agree that despite all the effects, the story and the funny characters, without Johnyy Depp it would have been just another Hollywood blockbuster. But I certainly do not underestimate the power of Gore Verbinski's production. It will grab you from the beginning and won't let you even in the end, simply because the adventure hardly begins. Now we are waiting for the final of the trilogy, hoping to be even longer than 150 minutes, because lately there are not many movies that can make us both laugh and admire the effects for that long."

","Criticising Pirates of the Caribbean is a bit like criticising Christmas. It is one of those sacred institutions whereby daring to even utter a word against it leaves one branded a miser and a scrooge with no sense of fun, but the downside is sometimes it is quite apt. Now the original Pirates movie was terrific, an energetic romp through the high seas that has become one of the classic blockbusters of the decade, but the sequel sadly isn't quite as good. Like trying to recreate the childhood magic of the holiday season as an adult, it just isn't as rewarding. Not that Dead Man's Chest isn't a good film, far from it. In fact it's another highly entertaining ride with enough one liners, set pieces, ""yarr matey"" shenanigans and sea monsters to keep the multiplexes packed for months, but unfortunately it doesn't have the zest of it's predecessor. The main reason for this appears to be a case of over-ambition on the producers part as they have crafted an epic film with multiple plot strands and have sadly succumbed to the same over-stretching that blighted the Matrix sequels.<br/><br/>The storyline here involves Captain Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) attempts to pay off a blood debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), commander of a fearsome crew of sea monsters and Captain of the fabled Flying Dutchman. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) meanwhile is hired by the East India trading company to retrieve a key that Sparrow is searching for in return for pardons for his crimes in the first film. Inevitably, Turner's fiancée Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) becomes involved as well and all three characters set off on their own individual plot lines as they race towards a reunion in the latter half of the film. This may sound exciting on paper, but sadly what it translates to is increasing the running time to a bladder-challenging length and over-complicating the premise. Worse, each character is afforded an equal amount of attention and as they all become separated, Johnny Depp is given less screen time. Bad move. Jack Sparrow was the best thing about the first film and once again, every second he is on screen is a joy to behold. Unfortunately, Turner and Swann are considerably less interesting characters and whenever the storyline returns to them, you find yourself tapping your fingers and waiting for the mascara-clad pirate rogue to reappear. The pacing suffers because of this and there's a continual sense that much of the fat could have been trimmed to make this as sleek a vessel as the first: an escape from an island populated by cannibals at the start for instance is riotously enjoyable but in all truthfulness, isn't that essential to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>That said, Dead Man's Chest is still a rewarding experience despite it's faults. Alongside Depp's vibrant charisma there are some terrific performances including the return of the ever bickering Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook) who provide a lot of laughs, plus the foreboding sight of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). His is a villain that easily matches that of Captain Barbosa from Curse of the Black Pearl, a sea-dwelling abomination with horrific arachnid legs and a beard composed of a slimy wriggling mass of tentacles. But the real breakout is from Jack Davenport, who returns to play the now-ruined Commodore Norrington. Where once was a man of honour is a drunken, brawling, back-stabbing villain and one of the biggest surprises is that he quite effectively steals every scene he's in.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the studio hasn't held back on some big budget set pieces. A three way sword fight inside a spinning waterwheel is perhaps the standout as director Gore Verbinski makes the players throw in a really rough and tumble ride that looks so dangerous it's amazing nobody was hurt. Added to this are plenty of rucks with the Kraken, a vast sea monster sent by Davy Jones to drag Sparrow to the bottom of the ocean and numerous clashes with all kind of villains.<br/><br/>Additionally, they should be praised for making Dead Man's Chest a significantly darker proposition. There's an ever lingering sense of foreboding hanging over it and the moody lighting, grim score, themes of damnation and the sight of men having their eyeballs pecked out by crows leave no doubts that the waters are far more turbulent this time around. And let's not even get into the sub-textual references of Jack Sparrow falling into an open grave...<br/><br/>In a nutshell then, Dead Man's Chest is a film all set to divide audiences. The over-indulgence in the running time and the sometimes convoluted storyline do it no favours but these grievances aside, it still makes for a glorious evening's entertainment with plenty of giddy thrills to remind us all why we love Jack so much. Just bare in mind that it is the first part of a two part story and come the jaw-dropping cliffhanger ending, you'll be counting the days till Pirates 3 sets sail."

","This movie was so awesome that I was stunned at what was happening. It took me five minutes to get what just happened in my head. I will not contain spoilers since I don't like to give them away but I have heard when number 3 will be coming out. It will be released on May 25, 2007! I have heard this from a manager at a cinema who I know very well. I do think there are hints in Dead Man's Chest that will be in End of the World (number 3)!

","I remember when I first saw the poster for Pirates Of The Caribbean : The curse Of The Black Pearl I laughed. I was wondering how desperate was Disney for a hit? Then I saw trailers for it and I thought to myself, Hmm That doesn't look so bad. After hearing the rave reviews from fans and critic's alike I gave in and saw it. i walked away loving every minute of that film and did not want it to end. I did not make the same mistake beating around the bush and saw Pirates Of The Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest on opening night. While I really enjoyed this film I walked away liking the original more. Don't get me wrong there's plenty of action and the CGI was amazing, and of course Johnny Depp was brilliant but the original just had a better story line that's all. The begging of DMC starts off a little slow, however this is for character development, which is usually overlooked in Hollywood. The Crown of England is not to happy with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Kierra Knightly) for helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape at the end of the original. The payment for the crime is death. Now Will Turner, to save Elizabeth's life must return with The compass of Jack Sparrow or his bride to be will die. Jack on the other hand is up to his neck in debt and his life is on the line again, this time with the evil Davey Jones, who looks incredible with all the make up they put on the actor. The only way for Jack to be truly free is for him to find the ""Dead Man's Chest"" and stab the contents of the chest to kill Jones (That would be Jones's heart). However Jack is not going to surrender the compass to find the chest so easily to Turner, and he doesn't care that Ms. Swan's life is in trouble. In the meantime the only way Jones has said that Jack can get out of debt is for him to gather 100 souls for Jones and thus the rat race begins. Depp, who is one of the best character actor I've ever seen (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Ichabod Crane, Willy Wonka, and Donnie Brasco) is once again brilliant and hopefully will be nominated again for best actor for the role (he lost to Sean Penn for Mystic River). I do believe that Depp will be an Acadamy Award winner some day. As for Bloom and Kinghtly they pick up right where they left off. I think the thing that kind of bummed me out the most about Pirates 2 was the ending. While I won't give it away, let's just say that it's becoming more and more of a gimmick in Hollywood nowadays's to have the type of ending that Pirates 2 had. I think the thing that was so great about the original was that it was a sleeper hit. No one thought it would do well and it took the box office by storm. I'm not saying I didn't like Pirates 2, I thought it was great and also didn't want it to end. I just enjoyed the original more that's all. On a scale of 10 I give Pirates Of The Caribbean : Dead man's Chest an 8. With plenty of action, great effects, and plenty of laughs it a great film, just not as good as the original."

","This is the sort of movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Lots of thrills and some big shocks. I will watch again and again. Disney makes em right. The stunts are as wild as the first one. The actors are comfortable in their roles. Bill Nighy and Stellan Skarsgard are an awesome pair of additions. The action is just fast enough you feel like you're on the ride but slow enough to understand it all. Johnny Depp makes you want to see what he does next as Jack Sparrow. The inclusion of the East India Company brings a wild mixture of historical perspective. Then, at the End, Geoffry Rush comes down the stairs. The Krakin is wild, as is Davey Jones. The third movie will not get here soon enough."

The special effects on the Flying Dutchman's Crew as well as Davey Jones were phenomenal! I would highly recommend this film, and if you go, stay until after the credits because there is an extra sequence at the end that you don't want to miss. It is hilarious as well.

And the scene where the waterwheel is rolling around the island was the best (""Hello, Poppet..."" the wheel rolls by with Norrington and Will fighting, and Jack chasing it 2 pirates and Elizabeth look at it with shocked look on their faces...then continue with their fight for the chest).<br/><br/>I can't wait for the continuation.

The soundtrack was amazing, just as good as the soundtrack from Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>It doesn't match to the standards of Curse of the Black Pearl, but it came close. The ending was a surprise, although now I am anticipating the third movie even more. Some parts I didn't care for, but I think that is because it was confusing at certain points to me. The new characters were quite fascinating to look at, some were quite scary. It would've been nice if they explained a little more of their history.

This movie had everything! It made me laugh out loud on numerous occasions. It made me jump out of my seat and hide my eyes during some seriously scary scenes. And the action scenes were great!

It takes a while to take full flight, but when it does, Dead mans chest will have u laughing, on the edge of your seat and leave u wanting more, with an interesting cliffhanger ending.

The plot keeps you gripped and the special effects are really something to talk about. Johnny Depp's performance as captain Jack Sparrow are brilliant as ever. The writers seemed to have done an excellent job at keeping this film true to what they envisioned when they wrote the first instalment.

"foxmulderx20","3","4","8","9 July 2006"," Really Could Have Been Better
","I walked into this movie with very low expectations (which i figure is generally a good way to escape disappointment) and to my surprise still left disappointed. Very disappointed.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is filled with mind blowing CGI, at times great lines, and a few memorable scenes. However, just taking these few ingredients and stirring them all together does not equal a movie. Why not? Well, a movie needs a plot. And not just several pointless plots thrown together haphazardly to add to length. It needs at least one substantial plot. That feature is what this movie regrettably lacks.<br/><br/>There are a lot of subplots in this movie, such as Will Turner's (Bloom) run in with his barnacle covered estranged father, Elizabeth's (Knightly) crush on Jack Sparrow, and a detour to a tropical cannibalistic island that lasted much too long. Through all this and the gratuitous violence and gore it's difficult to figure out exactly where the dead man's chest comes in.<br/><br/>The acting was decent in this movie. Depp (though he has lost some of his Keith Richards persona in this movie) and Knightly are always worth watching, though Orlando Bloom leaves much to be desired.<br/><br/>It's not that the movie has no potential. With a good editor, who, if he really is good, would cut out a good hour of this movie, it could be almost as good as the first."
"Matt_Layden","7","4","8","8 July 2006"," ""Great In Doses...But The Film Accomplishes Nothing""
","Captain Jack Sparrow owes an unpaid debt to Davy Jones and his underwater sea creatures. The deal was that he would be captain of the black pearl for 13 years, in return for his soul. Time's up for Jack and he must pay up. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the much anticipated sequel to POC: Curse of the Black Pearl. With every sequel, one must be able to up the ante. People expect more action, more adventure, more danger, and more love challenged between the characters. At first glance it would seem that Dead Man's Chest would deliver all of this and more. Unfortunately, it suffers from many things and relies on too much in order to get the audience to go along with the ride. When compared to the original, and you always compare the sequel to the original, Dead Man's Chest doesn't match up. The film is good, it was quite good and it will most definitely entertain, but the film doesn't seem to accomplish all too much.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest and it's soon to be released sequel At World's End (what a goofy title) takes a note from the Matrix trilogy. Both movies were filmed at the same time and will most likely start off directly where the other left off. The ending to DMC does in fact set up everything in the third. Much like reloaded though, no matter how good this film is, it won't be able to touch the original. My main complaint is that the characters accomplish nothing. DMC is a much darker film then Pearl, at the end the characters are basically left with nothing which is suppose to make us want to see the next installment even more to see how they get out of such predicaments, specifically speaking, Jack Sparrow's current situation. But like I said before, the characters accomplish nothing. At the beginning of the film, Will and Elizabeth are suppose to get married, they don't, They are suppose to get the Dead Man's Chest, they don't. Will is suppose to free his father, he doesn't. Jack is suppose to the souls, he doesn't. DMC is just one long set up for the third film, which makes me beg the question. Did this story really need to be split up into two films? There was so much that they could have cut out in order to condense the two film into one. But alas, we live in a greedy world.<br/><br/>Depp, does very well with Sparrow, as is expected. Although, Sparrow seemed to come off as too feminine in this film, I don't know if this was just me but that's what I got from Depp's performance. From the way he would run to the way he would try and grab the key off the Commodore. This doesn't hurt the film all too much, but it can be distracting. Bloom, he seemed to annoy me in this film. As he does in every other film he is in, save for LOTR. Not necessarily his performance, but his voice. The way he tries to seem commanding but comes off as a pretty boy. Keira Knightley was alright here, she doesn't do all that much and there is no real chemistry here between her or Bloom. Or even character development for that matter. Hats off to Nighy, he did a superb job replacing Rush as the main villain. The special effects of his character were very well done and you can see how they modeled this character after him with every expression that he makes. His ""sea phantoms"" are another great treat for the eyes. These guys make the skeletons in the original look like nothing. I really enjoyed seeing the ship burst out from underneath the water surface. Skarsgård was another treat, for the very little screen time that he had, he did a mighty fine job. But what was with the voodoo chick? I did not understand half of what she said.<br/><br/>The special effects are great and are perfect for the ""summer blockbuster adventure"" film. From the giant sea creature to the sea phantoms, everything is top notch. I spotted one or two off beat parts but that's mainly due to the crazy factor of what was on the screen. Seeing the creature destroy the ships was great. But that's the only real adventure action type sequences we get. Other then a long and drawn out sword fight on a giant wheel, that was cool at first, but once it kept rolling, the cool factor was rolling away with it. The sword fights do not match the original in any way, but that's not supposed to be the highlight, it's the huge sea creature destroying everything in its path.<br/><br/>The comedy did seem forced in some parts. You could tell that they were going for the funny in some scenes but it doesn't always work. Sparrow is basically one joke after the other, or one funny look after the other. There are funny parts in the film, but it just tried to capture the same spirit as the original, but it doesn't. The score is great and has that ""adventurous"" feel to it, even if it is played once too many. But when you have a great score like that, or Superman, you're suppose to play it every chance you get.<br/><br/>In the end, Dead Man's Chest is a good summer action adventure film. It does deliver on the action, the comedy (in parts), the excitement, the special effect and the enjoyment. Although, you may find yourself wondering what more they could have done, why the film is so long with so many things that do not even need to be in here. As well as with the final scene, you may have some questions that you can only pray for get answered in the finalhopefully final installment."
"TheZapRowsdower","10","4","8","8 July 2006"," Critics drop the ball yet again. The best movie of the summer thus far. Yes, even better than Superman.
","Let's start by showing what the critics are saying about this film.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean returns to theaters for more summer swashbuckling, only they may have forgotten to buckle their swash."" -Joshua Tyler, Cinemablend.com. <br/><br/>""Yes indeed, Pirates 2.0 is a theme ride, if by ride you mean a hellish contraption into which a ticket holder is strapped, overstimulated but unsatisfied, and unable to disengage until the operator releases the restraining harness."" -Lisa Schwarzbaum, Entertainment Weekly. <br/><br/>""This sequel is appropriately named, because that's what you'll be staring at for nearly half the movie: dead men's chests."" -Diana Saenger, Reeltalk Movie Reviews. <br/><br/>Oh, thank you critics. You make your misguided opinions so much easier to discredit when you think you're being funny. Aside from the obvious smear campaign these critics are trying (and will undoubtedly fail) to pull off, there was nothing about this film that didn't work for me.<br/><br/>First thing's first. Did you like the first one? If so, you can proceed to ignoring half of the negative reviews already -- the people who ALSO did not like the first one. Do you like the character of Jack Sparrow? Then ignore the other half, who seem to have a problem understanding that in sequels, characters are expected to return and continuity problems would arise if the actor would change the way he played that character.<br/><br/>Truth be told, this IS like a theme ride. But like the first one, it's like the best damn theme ride you ever rode on. The action sequences and special effects were top notch. The CGI didn't bother me so much because it didn't look like CGI. Most impressive was the way they handled Davey Jones. You really can't tell where Bill Nighy's extensive make-up becomes CGI tentacles. It's brilliant. I couldn't help but wonder why all Blockbusters couldn't be like this one. And the swordfighting? Well, don't get me wrong. These are among the greatest fight scenes I've ever seen on film. However, it seems to me someone forgot to buckle their swash. I don't know what that means, but evidently that got to SOMEONE.<br/><br/>All the characters are back in pure form and then some. Jack Sparrow now deals with inner turmoil, and if anyone can do that, it's Johnny Depp. Not only that, but he still retains his charm and remains just as likable in this film as he was in its predecessor. Keira Knightley gives one of the best performances of her career (topped only by her performance in Pride & Prejudice). Orlando Bloom's acting has improved as well. New additions to the cast such as Bill Nighy as Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgaard as another important character (not saying who) also add another layer of excellence to the film.<br/><br/>The film's atmosphere is much darker this time around, and I gotta say I freakin' loved it. It was like all the fun of the first film with a sense of impending darkness. In fact, the film opens up on a pretty down note, and by the end, any shred of innocence the series may have had has been shot to oblivion... once again, making me glad they went for the PG-13 rating as opposed to PG.<br/><br/>As I said before, the climactic fight scene is one of the greatest fight scenes ever seen on film. This is the kind of stuff that would make Errol Flynn say, ""whoa."" It was a beautifully choreographed triple threat swordfight in the midst of an epic battle, and let me tell ya, THAT was the most fun I've had within the last three summers.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a lengthy picture. In this case, that's a good thing. Because in its entire running time, I never got bored. They don't give you a chance to get bored. When they're not fighting, the characters are always enough to keep you going. The story is NOT lacking as the critics will have you believe, it did NOT lose its heart, and it most certainly is NOT guilty of double-dipping. This is the best movie of the summer, and it's not Verbinski's fault, or Depp's fault, or the screenwriters' fault that critics are too thick-headed to realize that.<br/><br/>And a note about the ending: not only will you NOT see it coming, but you will most definitely WANT to see the third one. Sure, it's a cliffhanger ending, but I assure you, at the very last line uttered in the film, you will cheer.<br/><br/>100%"

","Watching the previews for Dead Man's Chest, I felt slightly apprehensive. I saw a whole bunch of weird creatures, dizzying chases through forest-scapes, and the perennial Captain Jack back and acting like his old quirky and slightly drunk self again. It seemed like this movie might make the mistakes of The Matrix Reloaded, heaping action scene upon action scene, whilst pushing character development way to the side in favor of large explosions and mythical sea creatures. I am happy to report that Dead Man's Chest delivers just as many thrills as the first one, plus a few dozen others along the way. Sacrificing neither character, nor original story, DMC consistently delivers clever witty comedy, fantastic special effects, excellent cast chemistry, and action reminiscent of the good old Indiana Jones days.<br/><br/>The story begins with Captain Jack Sparrow making yet another unforgettable entrance. We learn that Sparrow made a deal with the master of the sea - Davy Jones. Now his blood debt is coming up, and he must pay it. The only way Sparrow can get out of this is if he manages to kill Davy Jones. Alongside this storyline intersects another - both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner have been sentenced to death for helping Sparrow in the original film. Their stories collide, and thus a new and worthy Pirates story is born.<br/><br/>DMC starts out slow. I believe the reason for this was that it seemed Captain Jack had worn out his welcome in the three years since the last film. His acting seemed a bit forced, as did other quips and witty sayings from other members of the cast. However, this quickly evaporated as the incomparable Johnny Depp settled comfortably back into his role, setting just the right tone - somewhere between clever and insane. Or maybe both. Keira Knightley is back as Elizabeth Swann, with a much greater role and a more interesting chemistry with both Will Turner and Captain Jack. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner seems to be the slightest bit eclipsed the grandiose quality of the film in which he is in, but still, his character is expanded and given as much space as can be expected in a film like this. We are also introduced to new characters, including Bill Nighy as the squid-like Davy Jones.<br/><br/>The sea-creatures that make up Davy Jone's crew must be mentioned here. They are some of the most creative, grotesque, and fascinating villains to ever grace the silver screen. Each one is completely unique and different too - they are quite a step-up from the skeletal pirates in the original movie. Davy Jone's face that is half-made up of tentacles makes his just scary enough, but not too over the top. Bill Nighy's acting is finely pulled off as well.<br/><br/>Above all, what sells DMC is the action. Forget The Last Stand. Forget Superman Returns. Though each of those were fine movies in their own right, DMC trumps all of them, because its action does not require mutants firing fireballs at each other, or planes threatening to destroy baseball stadiums. This is a good, clean, fun action romp that we really don't get to see that often.This film is reminiscent of the good old days, like Star Wars, and, as I've mentioned twice before, Indiana Jones. It just simply is so well pulled off that I don't believe the action in DMC could have been any better than it was.<br/><br/>My qualms with the movie are minimal. As I mentioned, the movie seems a bit self-conscious at first - as if trying to very purposefully to live up to the first one. There is an incongruous set piece, about fifteen to twenty minutes long, where Jack gets captured by a bunch of natives, who, in an age-old cliché, come to think of Jack as their god. Eventually, of course, he escapes, but this long intermission from the main course of the story is very distracting. The action is very creative and very well done, but it just seems tacked on there for the sake of a longer and more action filled movie. Oh well. It works, I guess. Another personal qualm was Jack's old flame - an annoying African shaman queen, or whatever she was. She just seemed kind of cheap, and she was hard to understand. Oh yeah, and one last thing - Jack says ""bugger"" too much. He said it zero times in the first movie; why is he saying it so much now? It seems a more clever phrase could have been used - one ""bugger"" could have been okay, but six or seven? Ultimately, also, DMC is a tad too long - at 2 1/2 hours of running time, though drag is minimal, a simple snip of that unnecessary scene with the natives would have helped to sail this ship quite faster.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the reviews. It saddens me when critics try to make a movie out to be more than it wants to be. Fans of the first Pirates did not want a sequel that was more thoughtful, more brooding, and more of a focus on character development, while giving a backseat to the action. What fans want, Gore Verbinski, the director, delivers. More action, more crazy special effects, more Johnny Depp, more of everything that made the first one such a smash hit. This is the Pirates movie that everybody wants to see. Not some high and mighty character study exploring why Jack Sparrow is the way he is, or why Davy Jones is such an upset bugger. Though it may be a tad overloaded, this is completely forgivable, considering how spectacular the movie is. This the first pure, all-out, no-holds barred, popcorn movie of the summer, completely worth a movie ticket, and, if things hold up all right, maybe the third film will be worth a ticket as well."
"maccaveili","4","4","8","7 July 2006"," High Expectations....unfulfilled
","Let me first give a precursor to my review. When I went to see the first one, I had no expectations, I basically only went because my wife really wanted to see it in the theater, so I obliged figuring it wouldn't be the worst movie I've been to. In the end, I ended up loving it, and to this day, I can sit down and watch it again and again and not get tired of it.<br/><br/>With that said, I went into Dead Man's Chest with really high expectations. When it was all said and done, I came out completely disappointed. Maybe it was due to my expectations, maybe I'm just too critical, or maybe it really did suck in comparison to the first one. I can tell you this though, our theater was almost filled to capacity, and not once during the entire film did the theater go ""ooh"" or ""ahh"" or even laugh out loud together. Oh sure, there was that one girl in front of us and maybe 1 or 2 people behind us that laughed out loud more than a few times, but that was it.<br/><br/>**** SPOILERS ***** <br/><br/>Basically, Capt Jack Sparrow had made a deal with Davey Jones to be captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years in exchange for giving his soul to Davey Jones for 100 years. Why anyone would make such a stupid deal for just 13 years of captaincy is unexplained in this movie, I guess you have to assume that he must have just really wanted to be the captain of that boat. But if I recall, Capt Barboso simply led a mutiny to overthrow Capt Sparrow, so if it was that easy to just become the captain of that ship, why the heck would anyone sell their soul for 100 years to just captain it for 13 years? Then there was this scene where Davey Jones, William Turner and his father were wagering their souls for eternity playing a dice game. The rules of this game were not explained at all, and when it was over, I had no idea how the game was played, why the guy who lost actually did lose, all you know is that he did lose.<br/><br/>At the end of the first Pirates of the Caribbean, you felt like Capt Sparrow, Elizabeth and Will Turner would remain long life friends forever after everything they had been through and done for each other. However, the first time they run into Capt Sparrow in this one, you'd have thought they were still rivals against one another.<br/><br/>Then there was the VERY weird tribal scene on the island where Capt Sparrow was the chief who was to be eaten when the drums stopped playing. What the heck was that all about? It really had no rhyme nor reason for being in the movie other than to eat up some time and prolong what was already too long of a movie.<br/><br/>I still don't understand something towards the end of the movie. When the ""cracken"" (sp?) came up the first time to attempt to destroy and bring down the black pearl with everyone in it EXCEPT Capt Sparrow who was in a rowboat about 100 yards away running away like a coward, why if it was really after Capt Sparrow and not the boat (like Elizabeth told Capt Sparrow before she handcuffed him to the Black Pearl later) did it not just attack him in the rowboat instead of trying to bring down the Black Pearl when he wasn't even on it? If it was Jack and not the boat it wanted, wouldn't have been easier to just swipe him from the rowboat since he was basically right there in the water anyways? What was the purpose of the attack on the Black Pearl w/o Jack on it? Another question, what was up with the jar of ""land"" or dirt as Jack called it? Maybe I missed it, but I don't recall any explanation as to it's purpose. It ended up getting broken but yet there was nothing to come of it as far as I could tell, but yet there was this big to do about it when that woman gave it to Jack. Anyways....<br/><br/>Also, why was the Commodore being arrested? Yes he did let Jack have a day head start based on the ending of the first movie, but according to the second movie, he lost his ship in a Hurricane trying to catch Capt Sparrow. So if he was after him, why was he charged for assisting his escape? He never conspired to assist Jack's escape, if he had, he wouldn't have lost his ship in a Hurricane trying to catch him again.<br/><br/>In the end you're left wondering how Capt Barboso was still alive. Not to mention what ever ended up with the governor (Elizabeth's father), assuming Jack was now dead which we know isn't true since there is a 3rd one so that really had no effect on the viewing audience as we know he must somehow return. Also, I guess we are to assume that since the Commodore was the one who brought back Davey Jone's heart and not Will or Elizabeth, that they are still on the run from the Lord. So now I guess we are forced to see part 3 just to see the answers to those questions. I hope part 3 is a lot better than part 2."
"exquisitebeautee","10","4","8","7 July 2006"," 10/10 (No spoilers!)
","This movie was very good. It's a lot darker and grittier than the first Pirates movie, but all the main characters seemed better developed, as well. Orlando Bloom is believable as a dashing young swashbuckler and is less the bumbling idiot he was in the first movie. Johnny Depp also shines in his role of Captain Jack Sparrow and is great for comic relief. Keira Knightley is a slightly haughtier but more tough version of her character in the first movie and is impressive with a sword (or two). I really could have done without all those sea creature/men hybrids (the octopus one was especially disturbing), but all in all it made for a very enjoyable film. The ending of the movie actually caught the entire audience by surprise; not so much for what happened but more for the *way* it ended. Can't wait for the sequel next summer! Definitely worth every penny. Go see it!"

","I just got back from the midnight premier here in the Pacific timezone, and I have to say they have done it again. Once again Johnny Depp makes Pirates what it has become with his amazing characterization of Jack Sparrow. The twists and turns in the plot line are amazing, and as the previous comment said, the CGI is extremely well done. I have to say that the film is a slight bit darker than the first, but it all fits together very well and the roller-coaster ride style of the film is sprinkled with constant comedic timing just like the first. I wouldn't recommend it for the extremely young crowd (there were a couple loud groans from the audience during certain slightly gory bits), but other than that it is an amazing film. <br/><br/>One friend of mine was angry because she thought the film to be very ""un-finished""--keep in mind that there is ANOTHER Pirates film coming out next year! <br/><br/>See it. It's well worthwhile!!!"
"bondluva","9","4","8","7 July 2006"," The best fun I've had all year!
","I saw the film last night and have to say I had so much fun. The original Pirates film didn't seem to click with me when I first watched it and I couldn't quite understand the hype around it - however, the more I watched it the more I liked it and I ended up being quite excited about the sequels coming out. Last night as I sat in the cinema, I surrendered myself completely to the film and was completely blown away by how wonderful it was! Here, finally, is a film that has IMAGINATION to back up the special effects. So many movies lately have been about ""hot"" actors and ""special effects"" with very un-imaginative story-lines, very little plot, and bad acting. This film is the complete opposite. Though the actors are in fact considered by many to be ""hot"" (Depp, Knightly, Bloom etc) it isn't the focus point of the film - for example, you watch Kiera Knightly and think ""Wow, she's really stunning"" but you don't really care because you are more interested in what she is doing as a character! The story is Beautifully convoluted, outrageous and over-the-top it is totally refreshing. The many and various twists, and changes in loyalties and objectives by the assortment of characters is so old-fashioned that it just might be avant-guarde and therefore it is genius! At no point in the film can you predict what each character is going to do so everything that does happen takes you completely by surprise. The fighting too is taken to a whole new level - set in almost impossible locations and yet the wonderful imagination of the writers (and most probably a collaboration between the production designers and stunt choreographers) manages to produce breathtaking and hilarious fight scenes that you totally believe! The film is also LOADED with special effects, and yet they are totally justified (which is a point that the big studios seem not to understand these days.) There is a reason for each CG shot, and each special effect that you forget you are watching special effects. But that is also because they are done SO well! you buy into everything you see - nothing makes you think ""boy, that looked fake"". The acting is fairly solid, even from Orlando Bloom who I have never really thought of as a good actor. He is probably the weakest actor in this film but he is much better than in previous work of his. Bill Nighy is one of the most outstanding members of the cast - he plays the new character of Davey Jones and he does it marvelously, albeit he is mostly obscured by tentacles. Naomie Harris, who plays another of the new characters (Tia Dalma) is excellent - so much so that I wanted to see more scenes with her in it. Kiera is solid, as she always is. It isn't her best work but then its not a film that requires her best work - she does exactly what is needed for the film and therefore is totally competent in the role! As for JONNY DEPP...he is talented. Even though he is such a legend, even though he is my idol, I completely forgot I was watching JONNY DEPP...I believed him from start to finish and my admiration for his talent grew even more. His performance was even better than I could have imagined, and if this doesn't get him that illusive Oscar, I don't know what will! (the academy will probably be politically correct and give it to him for the third movie!) Having said all of that, I now want to go and watch it again. Its not Shakespeare (as the saying goes) but for this day and age in movies, it just as well might be! The only reason why I didn't give this 10/10 was because it ended...if I had it my way it would be a never ending movie! Oh, and P.S.: Gore Verbinski, you are a legend mate!"
"shadowwolf218","10","4","8","7 July 2006"," Bloody pirates.
","I went into this film at midnight tonight expecting a nice ride. The original was, without doubt, brilliant film-work. The CG was smooth, the plot was enough to keep you entertained, the characters (for the most part) had interesting relationships. Then there was Johnny Depp and the soundtrack of pure gold.<br/><br/>So I walked into the cinema tonight with the expectation of another nice swashbuckling film with slightly less allure than the first. Having seen the commercials, I was afraid for what they might have done with the plot..maybe they tied it in too much with the first film, which is a horrid trend in Hollywood of late.<br/><br/>But I'm sure by now you've seen that I rated the movie as a 10, not a 7 or an 8. It was by no means just another wild ride of enjoyable debauchery, this was a work of art.<br/><br/>I went in expecting at best the same quality as the first film, and by far my expectations were crushed under the blue waves. It was still wryly funny, even during parts of intense action. Placing a swordfight in a spinning waterwheel, for instance. Or leaving a dog on an island of cannibals.<br/><br/>The plot thickened deliciously, with enough reference to the original movie to keep a place as a sequel, but enough free plot to stand easily alone as an incredible film. The acting only improved, as it's obvious everyone has become more comfortable with their respective character. Depp again steals the show, but not by such a large margin as last time.<br/><br/>To be honest, I caught most of the plot threads at the beginning and thought I had everything figured out...up until the moment when Elizabeth chained Jack to the Pearl and left him to die. I didn't see a good deal of things coming, and that's tough for a script to do. Yet somehow, every thread is tied up smoothly by the end of the film. None of them are finished, mind you, and there's a great deal more story to be told (so much that I would hope they split this into a 4-part series, rather than fall victim to the wretched tendency of an ungodly trilogy ending with the third film so clogged with resolutions and philosophies that the basic momentum of the series is lost entirely.)<br/><br/>Moments of immense surprise that make sense in retrospect. That is what makes a good plot, a good book, a good movie. Dead Man's Chest might have seemed to give a good chunk of plot away in the previews, but it left every little gem for those brave enough to place themselves at the mercy of the thunderous ocean beneath the sails of the Black Pearl. Pirates 2 is, by the shot of a long nine, the best movie so far this year.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend you go into this film with an air of expectation. Rather, sit into your theater chair comfortably, let your mind follow as it will, and enjoy the ride. Try not to blink, and as any good pirate...hide the rum.<br/><br/>-C"
"DonFishies","6","4","8","7 July 2006"," Alright, but feels held back by a few inconsistencies
","I checked out the midnight screening of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest with mixed anticipation. I had thoroughly enjoyed the first film, and seriously consider it as one of the most recently released films that actually felt like it was made just to be fun. It was an obvious risky gamble as a film, and it paid off for Disney. As could be expected, two sequels were greenlit, and filmed back-to-back. And as one of the key highly anticipated films of the summer, it has some mighty shoes to fill. And understandably, there are mixed results.<br/><br/>Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightely) are about to get married. Unfortunately, the newly appointed Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) has other plans. They are placed under arrest for aiding and abetting felon Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), and are told that their penalty will be death. Meanwhile, Jack, after a great intro, is informed that he has to pay an owed debt to Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), and is now a marked man.<br/><br/>Revealing anything else would just give away some of the intriguing subplots, and the useless boring ones. Some elements felt a bit half-baked, but of course, will sound and feel a lot more developed come At World's End next summer. The script seems fairly well formulated, but it feels like they went heavy on story here, and cut back on the comedy and action that made the first film so much fun. There is plenty of it to go around of course, but it just feels totally lessened down in comparison to the first film. Another element missing here is a lack of character development. A few crazy developments do happen, but the characters really do not change at all throughout the film. Again, something that may be fixed in the next film, but nonetheless feels awkward here. One thing they did not bother changing from the first film was the intensely long running time. In fact, it's even longer. The editing feels a lot sharper as opposed to the original film, but there is still quite a bit of dialogue and useless add-ons that could have been excised.<br/><br/>Although not at the forefront of attention this time around, Depp still has the right amount of flavour to pull off Jack Sparrow. His performance in the original film was flawless, and he just continues his fabulous Oscar-nominated role here. As said though, he does take more of a supporting role here as opposed to Bloom and Knightely. Bloom does great again as Will Turner, and while nowhere near as stunningly superb as Depp, he puts in another fine performance for what is arguably his short career's best character. Knightely is alright here, but she looks and feels a bit distracted for the most part. She does not have the genuine independence or the spunk that her character had in the original film. Her character instead feels a lot more static and uneven in comparison to the other two.<br/><br/>Jack Davenport pulls in a great continued supporting turn as the conniving Norrington, as does Kevin McNally as first mate Gibbs. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook, although they could have done with a little bit less screen time, do great as the comedic pirate duo of Pintel and Ragetti. They were shining parts in the original film, and despite feeling overused, do very well here too. And although they only skimmed the surface of their characters, Nighy's Davey Jones and Stellan Skarsgård's 'Bootstrap' Bill Turner (who was only mentioned briefly in the original film) are great additions to the cast. The only thing they would have benefited from, was more screen time. I can only hope they get extended and more developed in part three. Other characters like Hollander's Lord Cutler Beckett and Naomie Harris' Tia Dalma are almost totally unreviewable, as they get even less screen time, and are given nothing but plot advancement/surprise revealing to do.<br/><br/>The music, while featuring a few recycled/redone tunes, is just as great the second time as it was the first. The depth and feel of it only complements the film. The costumes, set designs and makeup also continue to be well done. Their authenticity adds greatly to the film.<br/><br/>And even with their unevenness, the special effects dazzle. Davey Jones and his crew look absolutely phenomenal. Watch them in battle scenes and they look just as awestriking, if not more so, than the skeleton pirates in the original film. A particular standout for me was watching Davey Jones play the piano with all of his tentacles. It looks so realistic, and is done so well that it looks absolutely flawless on screen. However, the Kraken (a giant octopus that can be summoned at will) just does not look anywhere near as good. His tentacles, as they come around on the various ships, look fairly well done, but look weak when they attack any member of the cast. And when they do show anything more than just his tentacles, the effects look totally off, and feel inadequate in comparison to the great effects used for Jones and Co.<br/><br/>In the end, the film really is a mixed bag. It does have many inconsistencies and a lack of completion, but it is watchable. The original film is obviously better, but at least this does not feel totally rushed and ill-managed. I can only hope that they fix up the loose ends in the screenplay, clean up the effects and get a better editor for the next round though. Otherwise, this really is going to be a one-trick pony of a franchise. <br/><br/>6/10."

","(Warning spoilers) I thought this Pirates movie relied more on practical humor and less witty dialog then the first. In saying that it was still very good. I wasn't alone in wishing Elizabeth had stayed with Jack, as their relationship has much more chemistry then the rather boring Will - Elizabeth one. The end came out of no where, I thought the movie would continued on for ages, but good cliffhanger I guess as I'll sure be hanging out to see the 3rd one! THe plot was kinda what the fiddlesticks is going on here, but still a cool movie as long as you don't spend too much time trying to understand whats happening. Go see it even if you're not into action movies, its worth it just to check out all the hot people e.g Johnny Depp."
"cosmic_quest","4","5","11","28 July 2006"," Dull, childish and drawn-out, a sequel that has nothing on the first film
","I loved the first 'Pirates of the Caribbean', glad to see Disney producing a refreshingly exciting and enthralling film that kept folk of all ages amused. Like many fans, I lived in wait for the much anticipated sequel 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'. But when it finally arrived on our screens three years later, I was left quite disappointed with the result.<br/><br/>Set some months after the events of the first film, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' sees Will Turner's imminent plans to marry his sweetheart, aristocrat Elizabeth Swann, lie in ruins when vindictive English Lord Beckett, a man with an agenda of his own, arrests them for treason. He offers full pardons for the pair on the condition that Will retrieves Jack Sparrow's compass. From this point on, we follow the characters on a turbulent ride as Will eventually tracks down Sparrow only to be betrayed as the pirate uses the young man to settle a debt to Davey Jones, a sinister demonic captain of the infamous Flying Dutchman. Meanwhile, Elizabeth refuses to sit around waiting to be saved and escapes prison to search the high seas for her fiancé.<br/><br/>There is no denying that Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley all play their respective roles of Sparrow, Will and Elizabeth with fervour while Bill Nighy is particularly top-notch as the malevolent and insidious Davy Jones. Equally, their co-stars give excellent performances, on occasion, even out-shining the stars as is the case of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg, who play two of Sparrow's most intellectually-challenged crew members! The CGI in the film is also to a degree that shows no expense was spared nor were amateurs involved. Davey Jones' crew and ship were so visually stunning that the audience could be forgiven for thinking they were real such were the minute details that were heeded. The Kraken's destructive nature was also portrayed with chilling realism.<br/><br/>No, the problem with this film lies not with the cast or visual effects but rather a lacklustre plot that is veers from being repetitive and dull to predictable to downright childish, at times. The scenes where Sparrow is trying to escape the cannibals features humour more suited to a five-year-old's slapstick cartoon and runs on for ages. The end scene where Will, Sparrow and Norrington fight in the wheel also seems to have no end, leaving anyone over twelve glancing at their watch wishing the scriptwriter would learn some restraint. The Will/Elizabeth/Sparrow triangle is something out of a cheap, trashy romance novel while the character depiction is a bit 'off'. Neither Elizabeth nor Sparrow are quite so likable this time around as we see them both doing some pretty deplorable things. Although Sparrow was no angel in the first film, he was a rogue with a heart of gold compared to this smug traitor who left me feeling he was due for some pay-back.<br/><br/>Instead of an interesting plot utilising fascinating and eccentric characters to their fullest, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' relies solely on CGI and forced, infantile humour. What little sense of adventure and adversary in the film is drawn-out to the point where it just becomes tedious. It's almost as if Disney were hoping to completely coast on the success of the previous film so felt no effort was needed to be put into this film, deliberately ending it in such a way that the audience feels obliged to see the third film (which is to be released in 2007) if they want any resolution to the storyline.<br/><br/>However, personally, I don't feel at all inclined to see the third film. In fact, at the moment, my disappointment with 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' is such that I think I'm going to go the 'Matrix' route and just pretend the first film is the only film that exists."

We have action sequences stretched out beyond anything enjoyable, there is absolutely no depth to anything in the movie, you could be a mushroom and still understand everything happening on the screen. It was like watching formula 1 these days. Bland, no likable characters, no passion , no nothing. Just something happening. Great CGI and technical perfection.

FAMILY FILM people, by Disney...with a little bit of John thrown in to edge up their Paul."
"rorywan","5","5","11","7 July 2006"," Bloated action/SFX display doesn't hold a candle to the original!!
","OK, it looks like I'm the only person on this fanboy board who didn't absolutely love Deadman's Chest...<br/><br/>God I wanted to LOVE this movie. Sure the trailers that focused on a goofy cannibal tribal scene and an octopus pirate (Davy Jones) didn't excite me much, but with Pirates 1 being nearly the best mainstream film of the 2000's (better than ALL of the Star Wars prequels, on par with LOTR), I figured Pirates 2 would surprise me...<br/><br/>Unfortunately I was only surprised because most of this movie is a series of unimportant scenes created solely to showcase some very ridiculous but fun action scenes. Most of these scenes are overly long and contribute nothing to the story. Remember Peter Jackson's bloated (but beautiful) King Kong? This one has multiple bloated action sequences similar to the never-ending Kong battle with one then two then three tyrannosaurs in a field, with tyrannosaurs swinging on vines in a chasm, with gory bugs in that chasm, with velociraptors etc.<br/><br/>A lot of the dialog in Deadman's Chest seems a bit hard to understand though it may have just been the theater I watched it in. Pirate speech can be a bit muddled (like this film's plot). Speaking of plot, the many on-off-on the ship transitions make very little sense. We go to locales like the town in Part 1, Tortuga, an island of cannibals, some bayou, sand reef island, other islands, and then return to these places again occasionally. The plot is much less clear than in part one with the cursed treasure. One interesting plot device is even more use of pirate deceit than in Part 1 which leaves us wondering who will redeem themselves by the end of the film or in part 3.<br/><br/>Luckily Jack is still one of the most bad ass characters ever created, but his schtick has worn thin by this movie. He doesn't reveal much more depth and is far less surprising and ridiculous than before. Maybe part 3 will amaze us again...<br/><br/>The antagonists in Pirates 2 are nowhere near as cool as the ghastly skeletal pirates in part 1. It seems the new enemies are basically just a chance for ILM & company to show off some creepy animalistic special effects. Think ridiculous stuff like the Island of Dr. Moreau ! I'm fairly certain there's no good reason why these soulless pirates are part hermit crab, hammerhead shark, or octopus other than some computer geek thought it would be cool. I'm sure Disney mandated the huge variety of enemies so they can release more toys and have more spooky scares in an upcoming revamp to the Disneyland ride!!<br/><br/>BY FAR the best thing in this movie, is the last 5 seconds of the film before credits. I won't give it away, but it was perhaps the only EXTREMELY redeeming part of the movie. Let's just say it brings back an old acquaintance who happens to be portrayed by one of the greatest modern film actors. The idea of this guy, Jack, and Chow Yun-Fat together as friends or foes in part 3 is enough to keep me excited for 2007 as I forget about the bloated mess that is Deadman's Chest.<br/><br/>Fans of action crap like Nicolas Cage's late 90s action flicks (sans The Rock) will enjoy Dead Man's Chest. Hard core special effects junkies should also love it. Anyone who's seen a lot of creative or classic adventure films will realize much of the action scenes were pulled from past films and merely extended thanks to the sometimes-curse of CGI.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, I'd say Deadman's Chest is like the Matrix Reloaded or the Phantom Menace: Pointlessly bloated unimportant action stories that could have been a 30 minute prelude to the next film (Matrix Revolutions & Attack of the Clones respectively).<br/><br/>Don't take my word for it. Go see for yourself. The hacks at Disney needs to sell lots of tickets to pay for its acquisition of Pixar's talent."

","I found the movie to be a bit slow in getting started. I found myself nodding off waiting for the action to begin. I even noticed that other movie goers were not as ""into it"" like they were for the first Pirates. The special affects were about the only thing good about this movie. It lagged being humorous and romantic like the first. The first Pirates kept me on my toes with laughter and suspense and I enjoyed seeing it a few times more. This second movie will probably be added to the DVD collection. I just hope that the 3rd Pirates invigorates like the first and makes the movie goer walk out happy. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp what happened?????"

"jobalo85","4","5","11","7 July 2006"," Warning to Pirates' Fans...
","Dear Fans of Pirates, Battles on the seas, sword fighting, Johnny Depp and all other likings...<br/><br/>Buckle your seat belt or sheath your sword, this movie is nothing less than shock and awe, especially coming from the wonderful world of Disney. I saw this movie at one of the midnight showings and can say with pride that I go to almost every blockbuster as soon as it comes out. This was the God movie among insects this summer, it was the captain of the crew, it was the Black Pearl to all other ships for me this summer...and yes I'm comparing it to the likes of Superman and X3. Nonetheless, the day came (or morning) and I saw it.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS BELOW********** Just a warning to all readers, this is my personal opinion and if you disagree that is your prerogative...but I will tell you, I am very sincere and realistic. For those of you that do not wish to read much I will give you a few examples from past movies that best describe the (for lack of better words) 'feeling' about the movie...two come to mind in 'Kill Bill' and its retardo sequel and although it turned out great...Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions. I am too young to know whether or not the Emipre Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi had the same effect. The movie simply left you at the end of your seat and wanting...thats right...it left me wanting...<br/><br/>Now to details...the story is very inventive and well thought out, but as the case with many movies, way too many coincidences seem to just happen. Also like the Matrix...nothing is described how it happens or happened? Capt. Jack Sparrow has some debt to repay to the great Davy Jones. Ooooooooo...How did he get this debt? How did Davy Jones get squids for a beard? Why doesn't Keira Knightley get naked(Joke, of course)? All of these go unanswered in the movie...Just thought of another one, how does Jones control this Kraken creature? Uh huh, some of you didn't think about these.<br/><br/>Of course some of these details you have no idea about because you haven't seen the movie. Let me give you an option that everyone will love me for...if they do it. Rent the second movie on video the day before the 3rd one comes to theaters...be amazed at the second one for doing that to soooooo many adoring fans and be relieved to see the third one the very next day (Just keep in mind, I had to wait a year). Dead's Man Chest is nothing but a plot builder to the 3rd movie and definitely a disrespect to fans. Kill Bill was suppose to be one movie, one story...they took the story and created two movies for bigger profit. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead's Man Chest is the first movie of a two part story which obviously is to gain money. This is a disrespect to fans anyway you look at it. Why would anyone want to do this to their fans? At least Matrix Reloaded had an ending...Dead's Man Chest has you inching to the edge of your seat with swashbuckling, special effects, non-stop action...and then you look at your watch and notice its been two hours and twenty minutes and you realize it...your stomach starts to churn...you start to get mad...your face turns red...you are in absolute disbelief. The story of the second movie isn't going to end until the 3rd.<br/><br/>To finish this comment and to be able to submit it...I'm suppose to give it a rating. I sincerely do not know what to rate it because I'm not sure how much of the story should the rating be based on. This movie had amazing effects, non-stop action, and a very bleak love story which every likes...but the overall story murdered my liking of the movie. The cheapness of the producers to take one story and make it two movies disgusts me as a moviegoer. I can easily say that Dead's Man Chest is not even in my top five movies this summer. So, some may tell you to see it for the effects and just to know the story...just realize that you will get to see those same effects when the 3rd movie comes out as well...so do not make haste. Please do yourself a favor and lower your sails, sheath your sword...for heaven sakes, save twenty bucks and just rent it the day before the 3rd movie comes out...believe me, you will thank me when you do.<br/><br/>Sincerely,<br/><br/>-----------Joe"

"Leofwine_draca","4","2","3","12 October 2016"," Good CGI effects, that's it
","This is everything I hate about Hollywood blockbusters: pretentious, overly staged, clichéd, predictable, full of lame humour and, the worst sin of all, entirely overlong. Truly, this film doesn't know when to quit, and at two and a half hours the joke quickly wears thin. When you're making a lightweight action flick, the last thing you want to do is be repetitive: the lean pacing of a film like RAMBO showed how to do it just right. This almost plot less amalgamation of natives, pirates, ships, swordplay, sea monsters, and zombie pirates is wearying beyond belief, a self-indulgent show piece conceived entirely as a money spinner and nothing else.<br/><br/>Everyone raves over Johnny Depp in these films, but I'm afraid to say I can't stand the sight of Captain Jack. I suppose I'm the only one who thinks this drugged up, spaced out loser is entirely inappropriate in a kid's film – a Disney film to boot. The rest of the cast fare no better, with Orlando Bloom a charisma-free zone and Keira Knightley entirely bland. The huge supporting cast are entirely wasted, with nothing roles for the returning Jack Davenport, Tom Hollander, Mackenzie Crook, and Jonathan Pryce. Stellan Skarsgard pops up as a barnacle-encrusted pirate but he doesn't make much of an impression, either.<br/><br/>So why on earth did I watch this? For one reason alone: the special effects. I'd heard that the CGI in this really was special, so I was eager to see what multi-millions of dollars in computer effects could achieve. I wasn't disappointed. The entire movie is chock full of effects work, but they're most notable when it comes to the monsters. A giant kraken looks the part and is a definitely highlight, and the mud-men-zombies are also highly effective. Best of all, though, is Bill Nighy's character of Davy Jones, a guy who looks like a human Cthulhu. The squid effects used to animate Nighy are exceptional and among the best I've seen on film. Okay, so the script is daft, the spectacle excessive, repetitive and frequently against the laws of physics, but in terms of sheer CGI genius, this will take some beating."
"tburke85","4","2","3","11 May 2009"," Pirates 2 A Flawed Adventure Movie
","Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Mans Chest is not that great of a movie. Don't get me wrong the whole cast are terrific in their roles including Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, and Kiera Knightley as Elizabeth Swann. This film isn't all that bad but it couldn't been a lot better. The acting is great, the special effects are amazing, and the action is impressive but somewhat of a let down. Gore Verbinski does do an admirable job as a director but the movie is overlong and it feels like there's just too much going on a similar problem that Spider-man 3 suffered as well. Despite it flaws Johnny Depp makes the movie worth seeing because of his fantastic performance as the charismatic Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom is good as Will Turner and Kiera Knightley is equally impressive as Elizabeth Swann. The rest of the cast also turn in solid performances including Stellan Skarsgard as Boot Strap Bill (Will's father), and Bill Nighy as Davy Jones the legendary Captain of the Flying Ducthman. Nighy's unrecognizable under all the CGI effects that helped create his character. Nighy makes for an imposing villain but lacks screen time. The ending definitely leaves off with a cliffhanger and there is a surprise cameo by a returning character from the first film but by then you just want the movie to be over. At least in my opinion Dead Man's Chest is a decent movie but nothing spectacular that left me feeling disappointed."
"kingderella","6","2","3","26 March 2008"," a bit of a disappointment
","with dead mans chest the pirates of the caribbean make the jump from one time sugar rush to full fledged franchise. its a good idea, since that fictional world has tons of potential and the characters are great. the filmmakers get almost everything right: the characters we all fell for are back, new fun characters are introduced (my favorite being Naomie Harris as voodoo priestess Tia Dalma), and there is lots of kinetic action, a good sense of humor, lovely visuals and some spooks. unfortunately, the film is burdened with a incomprehensibly complicated plot that sucks away a lot of energy. it doesn't help that the film goes on for much too long and spends a lot of time focusing on Will Turner (played by Orlando Bloom) who is the least interesting of the three main characters. the story involves at least three major parties, all of which have secret motives and keep lying and double-crossing one another. its probably best to not think too much about the plot and just enjoy the ride and see where the film takes you. dead mans chest is ultimately a bit of a disappointment, but as it turned out, its just the build-up for the next entry, which is much better."

","I liked the movie overall. I guess it appeals to all, as a Disney made film. Swashbuckling and generally an energetic ball of adventure.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow gets all the best lines..and is great. The romance is fine, as is the pirate comedy. There are a lot of special effects, some of which are a little overdone. For example, the Goonies style pirates of Davy John. <br/><br/>However, I think the plot lets this movie down, especially the laborious ending, which actually never ends but is just a precursor to the next film. <br/><br/>How do writer's get away with this? It had so much potential and falls flat on its face in the resolution! With years of experience, I am just surprised that experienced writers cannot see where a plot begins to fall apart. I wonder if they are underestimating their audience.<br/><br/>In summary, if you enjoyed the style of the first, then no doubt many elements will tickle your fancy... don't be too disappointed with the resolution and ending.

"daidoff","9","2","3","31 May 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean 2: more high-seas hijinks
","The lasting pop-culture appeal of pirates is impressive, considering their many dubious qualities. In literature, music and film, they're usually described as thieves, liars, cads and drunks, and noted for atrocious personal hygiene. Yet, like ninjas, we seem unable to resist rooting for them  or worse, wanting to be them. Swashbucklers such as Blackbeard, Long John Silver and William Kidd have achieved immortality in our imaginations. They're the perfect anti-heroes: rebellious, bound to no moral code but their own hedonism and imbued with a sense of romantic intrigue. Although they're ostensibly bad guys, we envy their lusty, entrepreneurial spirit and their constant pursuit of liberty and happiness.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, the second film to feature Johnny Depp's fey, floppy Captain Jack Sparrow, invokes one of the most familiar names in pirate myth: Davy Jones, the fiendish dweller of the deep whose legendary locker (a euphemism for the bottom of the sea) houses the souls of drowned sailors. The origin of the Jones character is murky, so director Gore Verbinski and his visual-effects team exercised their creative licence. Played by an unrecognizable Bill Nighy, the character is a grotesque ghoul with a beard of writhing tentacles. Prone to hammering out dark fugues on his pipe organ like a carbuncled Phantom of the Opera, he's one of the creepiest villains in recent memory.<br/><br/>The chest of the film's title belongs to Davy Jones, and its contents are of great interest to Jack: it holds the key to controlling the seas. When the film opens, Jack and his crew are being detained on a remote island by cannibal savages who have mistaken him for a god. The sequence is an early stumble for the film; the clumsy stereotypes of the island's natives have already drawn complaints from rights groups. But Depp is in fine form, clearly relishing the chance to revisit one of his most colourful creations. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, back on the Caribbean island of Port Royal, blacksmith and aspiring pirate Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his fiancée, Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), are facing persecution for their association with Jack. A stern British lord, Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), promises to clear their names if they bring him Jack's special compass, which has the uncanny ability to guide people to their deepest desires.<br/><br/>Morality is a central theme in the film, a point demonstrated soon after Will finds Jack on the island (rather too quickly, in terms of the film's pacing). To appease the natives, Jack imprisons his old friend with the rest of his crew, the first instance in which the would-be hero betrays an ally to save his own skin. From there, the movie careers through dozens of convoluted plot points; like its predecessor, Dead Man's Chest is both too long and too complicated. But Depp keeps things interesting as Sparrow twitches and struts across the line between good and bad. His worst crime is abandoning Will to toil with Davy Jones's crew of half-men, half-mollusks aboard the ghostly ship the Flying Dutchman. Jones asks him, ""Can you condemn a friend of yours to a year of servitude in your name while you roam free?"" Sparrow replies, with callous ease, ""Yep, I'm good with it.""<br/><br/>At this point we're introduced to the film's real villain: global commerce and stuffy hegemony, as represented by the British East India Company. Left disgraced after the first Pirates film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, ex-commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) hatches a plan to hand Jones's chest over to Cutler Beckett, in return for the title and status he lost in the first film. Although Jones is a devil and Jack a scoundrel  he debases himself further by trying to seduce Elizabeth  the two end up in mutual opposition to the company, which is seeking the chest to gain control of the seas.<br/><br/>To use a business analogy, Norrington and Beckett are the multinational giants to the pirates' small-c capitalists. The British East India Co. is bent on dominating the ocean, thus quashing the lawlessness that makes piracy possible. When Norrington reveals his intentions, Jack calls him out for succumbing to ""the dark side of ambition."" It seems that for pirates  no strangers to greedy ambition  monopoly is the greatest evil of all.<br/><br/>So we end up rooting for the thieves, drunkards, even the demons as they remain defiant in the face of The Man. It's a classic David-and-Goliath scenario, and it's a big part of why the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise works so well as popular entertainment. Of course, it doesn't hurt that Dead Man's Chest is also great fun, featuring exotic locations, beautiful cinematography, eye-popping visual effects (including a sea monster battle that's one of the best going-down-swinging scenes ever put to film) and a keen sense of its own silliness. It's proof that the summer blockbuster, like the life of a pirate, is all about unmediated pleasure, sensory indulgence and high adventure"
"pathighgate","1","2","3","25 May 2007"," Probably the worst film adaptation of a Billy Ocean song ever
","Is there such thing as a ""perfect TV show""? Maybe. But Pirates of the Caribbean is hardly an example. For Pete's sake, the show didn't even have any pirates in it. Sure, half the movie took place on water, and I guess you could call Dennis Hopper's little aqua army a 'group of pirates', but that's stretching it.<br/><br/>Now, I should tell you right off the bat that I'm not a fan of prequels. This was supposed to show you how Edward Scissor Hands grew up when he was a kid in the olden days. Maybe I was in the bathroom when they showed that part, but I never saw it. I kept looking for young Scissor Hands when the so called 'pirates' were shooting about on their jet skis, but you know (and I just realized this right now), I don't think he could even ride a jet ski. He's got scissors for hands! You can't drive a jet ski when you have scissors for hands! <br/><br/>In any event, in this episode the entire planet is covered with water. There's the good guy, played by Orlando Bloom (looking suspiciously like Kevin Costner) who has his own boat and also can breathe under water because he has gills for some reason. Then there's the bad guy, played by Dennis Hopper who sails around the world in his 'pirate' ship (which is really just an old oil tanker) doing evil things.<br/><br/>At one point, Bloom's character discovers an old bag of mail from like 100 years ago and pretends to be a postal carrier. This pisses off Hopper something fierce. That's because in the olden days, there was nothing pirates hated more than mail. Getting a letter from grandma is like fingernails on the pirate chalkboard.<br/><br/>When everyone finally finds land, the TV show shifts and there's a mad dash to find the treasure of a pirate from the olden days called 'One Eye Willy"". It was kind of cheesy, because it was supposed to be taking place in the Caribbean, but for some reason looked a lot like America's Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>Eventually they find the treasure, and everybody's homes are saved from Dennis Hopper's evil land developers.<br/><br/>I was so confused by this movie that I actually became literally ill, and my case of violent diarrhea which has been dormant for some 15 years returned. I won't be buying this one on DVD."
"on-the-road-so-far","9","2","3","24 May 2007"," Not as good as the first one, but...
","Well, first I have to say, that I went into this movie with high expectations, but also with a certain trepidation, because after seeing the first film I wasn't sure if there's even a chance that the second one could be as brilliant as the first one.<br/><br/>That fear seemed to come true at the beginning of the movie. It was too fast paced and the beginning in Port Royal could have been a bit longer. It got better after that, even though I've heard from other people that they think that the entire movie is ridiculous, because everyone is always searching for someone or something. But I really don't mind that, because in my eyes the second part of the trilogy is mainly one big journey which leads us to the events in the third part.<br/><br/>The humour was again very good - there was a lot of slap-stick and Jack once again stole the show with his cunningness and manipulations while trying to save his soul.<br/><br/>At the end there was one moment in which I was completely shocked - and it wasn't Jack being swallowed by the Kraken or Barbossas return. It was the scene in which Jack leaves his Black Pearl behind to save himself, while the others are still fighting. It wasn't the fact that he left the others to fight his battle (it's not like he hasn't done that before) but I just couldn't believe it that he would leave his beloved Pearl behind. That's why I held my breath until he came back to defend his ship.<br/><br/>The visual effects in that scene are simply brilliant. ILM have really outdone themselves and it's amazing to watch the fight between the Pearl and the Kraken at the end.<br/><br/>Also, I really, really love the soundtrack! I already adored the first one, which fitted the lighter atmosphere in the first movie perfectly, and now I'm completely awestruck by this one! I especially love the theme for the Kraken and Davy Jones.<br/><br/>All in all, it is a perfect (except for the beginning) second part of an excellent trilogy."

Boy was I right, this movie was much ""scarier(children's point of view)"" and darker than the first one.<br/><br/>I agree with the others in their terrible reviews of this film. I loved the first one. LOVED IT. Have seen it a hundred times and never tire of it. This one started out totally confusing and you wonder what happened between then and when this one opens.<br/><br/>Will and Elizabeth were madly in love yet they waited so long to get married? And they went from being on top of the world and in everyone's debt to being fugitives? And like one critic said earlier, they are both out of prison why didn't they just run off and live somewhere else forever? Where did Elizabeth learn to handle a sword and fight so well if she is indeed the prim and proper girl her father brought her up to be? Oh, and the two pirates from the last movie show up and suddenly become these well articulated side notes? Didn't we kill all these evil pirates off in the first movie? Guess not as the captain comes back at what the studio is calling the ""end"" of this movie...not an end, but more like a panhandlers cup trying to draw you into ""donating"" another $10.<br/><br/>The movie was LONG, BORING, and poorly wrote. The actor's performances were good as usual, but they couldn't carry this movie. The waterwheel scene??? Perpetual motion scientists need to get a hold of it and find out what makes that thing tick! It rolled for miles it appeared like.<br/><br/>The references to the first movie were pretty stupid too. The commodore breaking the candle in the prison...weak. The rum jokes....weak.<br/><br/>The supposed feelings for Jack by Elizabeth? She has loved Will since childhood and now all of a sudden about the time she is going to marry Will she starts having feelings for Jack....WEAK.<br/><br/>Then the captain shows up at the ""end""? What good was the first movie if all the bad guys are still there? Did they do anything right in the first movie if all the bad guys are still alive and kicking? I don't want to see the third movie. They will probably just blow everything up and have tons of fight sequences with the same re-hashed dialog....Jack and Elizabeth will probably go back and forth like a bad Tuesday afternoon soap opera where she will finally choose Will in the end. I wouldn't be surprised if the financial executives at Disney wrote the 2nd and 3rd movies in an effort to tie it into toys and happy meals and sequels....I will continue to watch and enjoy the first movie, but will not bother with anything that comes out after it."

","The pace of this sequel never flags. It's entertainment from start to finish. There's plenty of action and a cast full of colourful characters. The special effects are marvellous and when you see the kraken you can see how much special effects have progressed since It Came From Beneath The Sea. This tentacles are incredibly lifelike. In the scenes on the Flying Dutchman you can smell the stench of the salty sea air, the seaweed and the shellfish. It was interesting to learn that Davy Jones is actually a CGI image. When I first saw the film I thought it was Bill Nighy in a costume and only the maggot-like tentacles round his face were an effect. He gives a great performance. At the end of this film one can detect a Princess Leia-Han Solo-Luke Skywalker triangle forming between the main characters. We'll see how this progresses in the next film which is out in a few weeks."
"llanley93","4","2","3","3 May 2007"," just pretend there never was a sequel
","Pirates of the Caribbean 2 is not good. It is a long movie and unfortunately its story-telling makes it seem longer. Every minute of this film seemed manufactured. <br/><br/>There's not much plot to even discuss. If anything, it seems to be a showcase of effects to justify the budget. So if you like seeing people rolling in things or on things, rather than actual story development, this might be the movie for you. <br/><br/>The jokes aren't very funny. Even the Jack Sparrow character's expressions and one liners are weak at best. And watching Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, who have absolutely no chemistry, is a bore. It doesn't make one want to see the sequel in the least."
"Whetzellus","3","2","3","30 April 2007"," Unfaithful
","Simply said this sequel was a satire of the first one. They took personalities and dramatic elements from the first and made a caricature of the whole thing. It decided not to take itself seriously, which in some cases can be nice and self depreciating, but in the case of making a sequel it shouldn't do this, since it insults the fans that went to watch it the first time around. I swore this was directed by a different person and when I learned it was Gore Verbinski again I felt ashamed that he had turned his back on such a great story and turned it into a cartoony farcical piece of garbage. The performances seem rushed as many films do when they are trying to rush production doing back to back films. I have looked at the cast of the next pirates movies and it looks to be more of the same. It is unfortunate people become fans of the first and blindly follow the next few films unwilling to look at it critically."
"Tom_Tziotzios","2","2","3","24 January 2007"," brings disgust to a new level
","I used to have the feeling that most of modern movies try to be more and more disgusting in order to attract the attention of the viewer. This movie proves this totally. The amount of disgust in this movie increases linearly with time. Initially it's not that bad, you get some Keira Knightley moments, so you think it's going fine. People are normal and even when you see Johnny Depp trying to escape from that sort of prison where scary birds eat humans alive(alive being the humans,not the birds,well actually the birds are alive too :P) you think it is acceptable since that may have been the artistic way for the director to go on. But then deformed people (actually hybrids of human and fish) start appearing more and more. You get the feeling that they are disgusting, but after some time, they look sexy compared to the more recent characters. Don't get me wrong. I don't have problem with ""disgusting"" scenes as soon as they have a point. If you watch Pasolini's Salo you will get a lot of scary scenes, but it's a very good movie, very worth watching. Because it has a reason to exist. Pirates of Caribbean is not worth existing. It's only made because some people were bored and decided to make money, thanks to the audience that go to the cinema to watch every trendy thing that everyone else has watched. The final conclusion is that if this movie did not exist, the history of cinematography would have been better."
"mdv_666","4","2","3","22 December 2006"," A whole different experience from The Black Pearl
","I love pirate films, I really do. I'll even admit to liking ""Cutthroat Island"". This film however, I do not like. OK, I did not walk out of the theatre on it but when I finally did (after the film was over) I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>So, what is there not to like? Plenty. This is the first Johnny Depp film I have seen where he is not interesting to watch. I would not say he is outright bad in this, but he is sort of on autopilot, reducing his Jack Sparrow to a very 2D character, who I lose all interest in weather he lives or dies. The same is unfortunately true for the other two main characters. The CGI is sometimes horrible, but at the same time in other places it is oddly enough some of the best I have ever seen! Further: the plot. Where in the Curse of the Black Pearl, it was the Aztec gold that was cursed, I could buy that. Now everything and everyone seem to be at least a little bit supernatural, which is not just as fun. Also where the CotBP was a well-balanced film for the whole family, this should not be seen by anyone over 12; it is all slapstick and effects.<br/><br/>It would have been nice to see another CotBP-type sequel and not the typical Bruckheimer- sequel: more of everything (especially grand effects), leaving no room for the actual film.<br/><br/>But the worst, by far, of it all is that I will still go and see the third... Even though that is also part of what annoys me; instead of getting a good and enjoyable film, we get a product that just makes sure that we buy it. I wish that someone could have loved this project like Peter Jackson loved LOTR. Do not get me wrong though, I am all for a free market and I do think that we deserve what we buy and since I'll continue buying this, I guess I deserve it."

","It happened that I had to watch this movie on rather small computer screen with crappy sound, so I expected those annoyances to spoil the entertainment. Amaizingly, I was deep inside the movie after first several minutes and forgot about everything around. Still, the feeling is strange...<br/><br/>The quality of the movie was great by all means, it is the plot that made me somewhat perplexed. The first movie in trilogy (yes, it is going to be a trilogy) was much more straightforward: romantic love drove the whole plot, and the confrontation was obvious: the pirate against the law, the captain against the mutineers.<br/><br/>This sequel brought a lot of contradictions into the plot: now the enemies are friends and friends are enemies. Everyone of main characters sometimes acts on the evil side, even Elizabeth, when she condemned Jack Sparrow to death for selfish reasons. Everything starts as a noble quest caused by injustice and love, but quickly turns to the marathon of individual ambitions.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow looses his heroic appearance and becomes a sneaky bastard for the major part of the movie. Will and Elizabeth seem to forget about their love, he looks after helping his father, and she is preoccupied with the idea of turning Jack Sparrow to a good side, and apparently flirting with him. Which does not stop her from meanly trading his life for others safety after a long and passionate good-bye kiss.<br/><br/>Commandor Norrington is not a nobleman any more, he becomes a drunkard and is now preoccupied with his own ambitions, and he is ready to cut the throat for that. The members of the crew turn their sides several times during the movie, but nobody hold that against them, it is considered ""normal"". Well, pirates they are.<br/><br/>In other words, there are no ""good"" and ""bad"" characters in this movie as they were in the ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". Even the biggest villains of the previous movie are employed to help the heroes in this one.<br/><br/>Personally, I welcome such a dualism in the main characters. This breaks a long lasting tradition of pure ""good"" and ""evil"" and makes the movie more ""realistic"". I still wonder how children will take that. Will it teach them that they have equal right to do good and evil things? But I understand why ghosts of the sea are not very frightening. This is by no means a horror movie for children, it is an adventure. And a good one, at that.<br/><br/>So I give this movie +10, since it is a wonderful entertainment. And I am forced to be waiting for the third part of the trilogy to see who will end up on the ""dark"" and who on the ""light"" side."

","This Sequel to last years successful Disney sea adventure The Black Pearl, has more spectacle than the first causing a muddle of a storyline. What was going on again? The stunts were spectacular. Johnny Depp's expressions were given heavy weight in close ups and his comic antics seemed overused and forced. The sea pirates are lost in their spectacular tentacle attire. It's full of these effects and cheap gimmicks and some amazing effects.<br/><br/>The sets and locations are well shot and some of the props were fun to view. The cast seemed well adjusted and a novel warm feel of returning with the audience. How do you kill a dead person again?<br/><br/>It is all flat somehow. A colorful sea yawning adventure."
"farez","4","2","3","10 December 2006"," Dead Man's Plot
","I enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean film very much for Depp's engaging and brilliantly entertaining portrayal of a mischievous pirate captain and his gritty crew. The rest of the cast was great (Rush, Knightley and Bloom) and overall that was the best pirate film since the classics of the 1940's and 50's.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the sequel Dead Man's Chest really sucks. This is a comic book without the heroes. If you like comic book movies, Spiderman and X-Men were way better and much more intellectual.<br/><br/>Sure the effects were ambitious and at times impressive, and the island scenes pretty, but the natives were goofy rather than intimidating and the whole aftertaste was all like a nightmare rather than a dreamy fun adventure.<br/><br/>The plot is convoluted. The script dumb. The storyline unbelievable and the special effects over the top and aimed at the Saturday morning cartoon demographic. Even with the same previously excellent cast, the acting is sub-par. Depp's performance is lackluster. He stretches his old character awkwardly without introducing anything new and his humor is less funny the second time around. I don't think it's his fault, it's just that the producers wanted sequel cash and spent their energy on effects and not on a script or a story. While the first film had some authenticity to it even with its fantasy visuals, this film seems to be aimed only at 12 year olds who want to see lots of slime and monsters. Who cares about an intellectual dialog? I was extremely disappointed and am no longer looking forward to the next sequel which is so unabashedly teased at the anticlimactic end.<br/><br/>I'm sorry but this film drops the baton. When is someone going to make a real pirate film with historically authentic villains and Das-Boot realism? Today's technology should be used to help a film not hurt it. I want to see authentic villains like Rackham the Red or the fierce Blackbeard who would drink grog and gunpowder, and light matchsticks in his beard to scare the enemy. That's way cooler than an octopus head or hermit crab face. Imagine what could have been done with a realistic evil captain who steals the gold and the lovely love interest...anyway I digress.<br/><br/>This film is like a video game without the joystick.I wish Davy Jones' locker had never been disturbed."

From the time I first saw the trailer I knew the movie was gonna be at least fun, but I wasn't sure it was gonna rise up to everyones expectations. But it did. THe story was well told and even though you were a little confused in the beginning, it ended up to develop beautifully. Johnny Depp was magnificent and you couldn't take your eyes off the screen when he played. Orlando Bloom did a very good job as Will Turner and he gave the character more depth and mystery, than he did on the first film. Keira Knightly played her part very good, even though the difference between Elizabeth in the first film and Elizabeth in the second one is evident from the beginning. The other characters completed the puzzle, each giving a little something so as to make the movie wonderful. Stellan Scarsgard forced you to look at him, every time he appeared on screen as Will's father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner and Bill Nighy was the most sinister Davy Jones, that made you wonder if his appearance was truly digital, or if he was somehow real. The next best thing were the special effects that were even better than the ones in the first film. But the cliffhanger in the ending was the cherry on the cake. The ending was the one that promised you that the third installment was gonna be darker and I'd like to hope better than the fist two.

I waited for the ending, a long wait, to wrap things up, only to be left hanging for the third part. I like movies with a beginning and an ending (like MI3), too much time has passed since I saw part I. I didn't understand the story and forgot most of the plot.

"cwrdlylyn","8","2","3","24 August 2006"," POTC - DEAD MAN'S CHEST : Tons Of Fun, Even If It's Not Quite As Creative As The Original...
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : DEAD MAN'S CHEST <br/><br/>Though this blockbuster sequel fails to capture the intelligence or the overall-quality that the first film holds, DEAD MAN'S CHEST opts to take the no-holds-barred approach. In CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, though there were many special effects and exciting moments, they all seemed to branch out of one strong storyline. In DEAD MAN'S CHEST, the plot seems to be created in order to accommodate the many different action set-pieces that the creators could come up with.<br/><br/>That's not to say the story on hand isn't a great deal of fun or rather engrossing. DEAD MAN'S CHEST follows Jack Sparrow as he struggles to free himself of a debt he owes Davy Jones. Turns out he was promised the right to be Captain of the Black Pearl for only a certain number of years before he will be forever a member of Davy Jones' underwater crew. However, when Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann show up in an attempt to clear their names with the government, they get tangled up in Jack's plan for escaping his debt.<br/><br/>The plot is engrossing, though not complete. However, that can be blamed on the fact that this piece is merely the first half of a two part film, to be later wrapped up with the third installment. As a single film, the plot is engrossing, but not rewarding. However, it does set up some interesting story lines that will inevitably make for an exciting final chapter in the franchise.<br/><br/>Something about this film lacks the freshness of the original, where Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow was a complete revelation. Also, at that time the high-seas adventure hadn't been brought to the silver screen in such a way for many many years. Though the formula is more familiar this time, the creators have come up with so many thrilling special effects and action sequences that one forgets for a moment that what they are watching isn't very original.<br/><br/>In the end, DEAD MAN'S CHEST delivers on it's promise to be one of the best times you can have at the theatre this summer. It's constantly entertaining, with the Kraken sequences and the island natives providing some of the most fun. Also, the character of Davy Jones is a visual feast. It's absolutely incredible to watch a character brought to life so realistically through CGI (only KING KONG eclipses this in quality)... and on top of that, Nighy's performance is a great deal of fun to watch. Johnny Depp still manages to ring every possible laugh out of the character of Jack Sparrow, and Keira Knightley continues to prove that she has an incredible charisma on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, DEAD MAN'S CHEST didn't need to be ""rewarding"" for me, because it kept me so thoroughly entertained for it's entire 2 1/2 hour running time. And above all things, it managed to make me a bigger fan of the successful series... someone who can't wait to see how these story lines are wrapped up and brought together in the final chapter. Sure, it's not of the same quality as the first film on many levels, but it's just as much fun. DEAD MAN'S CHEST (aside from X-MEN:THE LAST STAND) is at this point the only summer blockbuster to fully live up to it's hype for me, and that's not too shabby.<br/><br/>... B+ ..."
"DarthBill","6","2","3","22 August 2006"," Pirates 2: Aquatic Boogaloo
","Plot in a nutshell - picking up where ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" left off, the Black Pearl's Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) must try to worm his way out of a deal with the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). With a price on their heads, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his star-crossed virgin lover Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), are both forced to help Jack after the evil Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hallander) arrests them both and blackmails them to get Jack, or rather, his compass. The unexpected wild card is former Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport), who's life has pretty much fallen apart after getting caught in a storm pursuing Jack following the events of the last movie, and one way or another he's either going to get his revenge or get his old life back, no matter the cost.<br/><br/>Sequels are a tricky business. It's so hard to live up to the first one, let alone surpass it. More often than not, sequels often just feel like vain imitations/remakes/rehashes of the films that spawned them as the same basic formula is usually just flogged to death (Rocky's 2-5 and Matrix's Reloaded/Revolution come to mind here). There are exceptions, such as ""The Empire Strikes Back"", but they are few and far between. For the most part I enjoyed ""Dead Man's Chest"" but I cannot deny that the original film was superior.<br/><br/>The biggest sin of ""Dead Man's Chest"" is that it runs too long and tries to over-stuff itself, cutting back & forth between Jack Sparrow's antics, the misfortunes of Will or the misfortunes of Elizabeth, which then leads us to the misfortunes of Norrington, with a lot of action thrown in, whereas the first film had a more focused, driven feel to it. I saw the film with my dad and he commented that it felt like they took a book, ripped out the most interesting/exciting parts and then pasted it together in no particular order. Most criminally, the storyline with Will catching up with the sea zombie version of his father Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard buried under tons of prosthetic makeup & CGI) is probably the most interesting storyline going in the movie, but it deserves more time than it ultimately gets. The decision to turn Norrington into a full blown evil bastard was unexpected - I know he wasn't exactly the hero of the first film, but he wasn't the villain either, just the romantic rival (I blame this on the fact that they cut scenes that were meant to establish him as a nicer guy). The thing with Elizabeth becoming infatuated with Jack, or at least appearing to become infatuated with him, was a relatively minor offense but still an annoying one. It felt like the writers were trying too hard to both play to the popularity of Depp/Jack and also to try and resurrect the opposites attract magic of Princess Leia & Han Solo, the primary difference being that Solo was taller, better looking, had better equipment and had better hygiene than Sparrow. That seemed to go against part of Elizabeth's realizations in the first film that pirates weren't all they were cracked up to be, and she struck me as being smarter than to fall for an obvious scoundrel like Jack. Or maybe I'm just over-reacting to their decision to put the young lovebirds fate in doubt. And there are some who will undoubtedly be annoyed by the cliff-hanger setting up ""Pirates 3: The Pirate Version of the Search For Spock"".<br/><br/>Okay, stuff I actually did like... there were some genuinely funny moments (some of which were overplayed), the action set pieces were well staged & well executed (if a little over the top), and the actors were generally good. Johnny Depp basically rehashes his performance from the first film, which works well enough since he still appears to be having fun as the drunken glam rocker pirate. Orlando Bloom is good in his usual low-key way (though he's basically got himself typecast as the earnest young hero and will probably spend the rest of his career being accused of just playing himself in every film he does).Nighy & Starsgard were good along with the rest of the undead crew, though they are basically a steroid fueled remake of the undead crew from ""Curse"". Keira Knightley was alright, though in a few scenes it felt like she was trying too hard (namely the ones where she's supposed to act like she's becoming infatuated with Jack). I guess I'm not being very positive here, am I? Well, if I make the film out to be worse than it actually is, I'm sorry. Just go in knowing that it's not as bad as the Star Wars prequel trilogy, Batman & Robin, Daredevil, Elektra, 2005 Fantastic Four and Catwoman.<br/><br/>Now go hide the rum."

I loved Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl, but the sequel was incredibly bad. I came into the theater after seeing the trailer, and I expected it to be a very good sequel, and I would've been correct, the Direction was great, the acting was great, the stunts were great, but what you need most to make a movie (the story) was awful.

Depp used many of the same adoring facial expressions and quirky moves that was so endearing in the first film, but there was almost no context, it was ""insert cute expression here"", splice, next scene. The movie was loooong, and both my girlfriend and I kept wishing it would end to no avail! There were subplots which made no sense and went nowhere... lovable characters from first movie would pop in with no purpose, parade around and then linger... for the sake of being there. It was like an embarrassing party where people show up and don't know what to do, so they just sit around and shuffle their feet. The visual effects of this film were very good, but I personally found them gross. They obviously tried to change it up from the first film, but while I loved the spectral shapes of I, I got yucked out of the slimy grossness of II.

","I really looked forward to this movie. Pirates I is one of my all-time favorites. I own the DVD and have watched it many times. I was gravely disappointed in Pirates II. They tried too hard to make a BIG MOVIE. Way over the top, unrealistic action scenes and special effects do not make a good movie. A good story, meaningful dialogue, and multi-dimensional characters do. This plot was contrived; the characters, one-dimensional; and the story-line muddy. I found the over-the-top action, like the prisoners escaping from the rattan balls and the duel on the water wheel ridiculous and off-putting. <br/><br/>The filmmakers used Peter Jackson techniques like filming two movies at once with a cliffhanger ending and an ongoing story. Lord of the Rings had the strong through-line, deep mythical theme, and rich characters to support this. LOTR also was based on a three-part classic book with generations of devoted (not to say fanatical) fans. Pirates II simply doesn't have the depth or weight to support these devices. <br/><br/>Nonetheless, I did get into Dead Man's Chest halfway through, hence my rating of 4. I liked Davey Jones, the voodoo queen, Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom. Johnny Depp is a brilliant, chameleon of an actor--my all-time favorite--but even he couldn't save Pirates II for me."

Re-hashed ""Why's the rum gone?"" jokes account for about an hour of the actual movie. The Elizabeth Swann character takes a turn of treachery at the end, and the Norrington character was FAR too over the top as a washed-up, down on his luck man of former military status.<br/><br/>I can't begin to tell you how disappointed I was upon leaving the theater. The only marginally convincing character was Bloom's William Turner.<br/><br/>The highest point of the movie was the last 30 seconds."

","One of the best modern-blockbusters in a long time was Gore Verbinski's sprawling Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Johnny Depp became more than the infamous, poetic cult-hero as he made the role as Jack Sparrow nothing but brilliantly good. The movie had guts and entertainment more than any other movie, the fabulous setting was perfect for great actors as Depp, Bloom, Rush and Knightley to let their wildest imaginations run free. With it's speed-fueled follow-up finally arriving the cinemas, Dead Man's Chest is packed with more action than the first and follows the exact same formula. And this is totally okay, because seriously we couldn't get enough of the first pirates so we simply wanted more of this adventure; and here it is.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest has exchanged the comic and un-serious undertones of the first with more serious aspects and moods, and though this proves to be a small misstep it doesn't affect the movie all that much. Dead Man's Chest has also got a longer runtime and with this Verbinski sees the opportunity to for-fill even more of our fantasies of pirate-action; examples of this finds Sparrow being caught in a tricky situation with cannibals and bad-guy Davy Jones gladly challenging the Black Pearl one more time. Johnny Depp is superbly back in the suit of Jack Sparrow and Verbinski seems to have a good understanding of not misusing his key-player; and it's fantastic seeing that everybody's back for the second coming, though it's also a fact that some of the returning characters are very useless and dull, especially the return of Norrington. Dead Man's Chest should have gone to a totally new water with it's story and based the whole movie around a totally new event instead of dragging old-characters and subplots into the story. This makes the whole story weaker than it actually is, because the new tale of Davy Jones is almost just as thrilling as Captain Barbossa's.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest is a striking summer-movie and it's packed with action and excitement, so it really is a worthy sequel to the ingenious original."

","A step down from ""Curse of the Black Pearl"", but fantastic none the less. Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann embark on another voyage of fantasy. Lucky for us, none of the main cast or crew has been changed; unfortunately, some of the jokes are being reused as well.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow makes another miraculous (and side-splitting) entrance, where he then boards the ""Black Pearl"" with his crew. They head out in search of a key, which leads to a chest, holding something Jack doesn't say. Complicated, yes; funny, yes. Meanwhile, back at Port Royal, Will and Elizabeth are about to be married when they are arrested for helping Jack escape the gallows. The punishment is death and the only way to escape it is to bring Cutler Beckett (the man who has arrested them) Jack's special compass.<br/><br/>We discover Jack had made a deal with Davy Jones, and it's time to pay up. Jack, in his usual manner, tries to get out of it. Will and Elizabeth soon join him for an adventurous movie.<br/><br/>The beloved theme music and other tunes return, along with a touch of new score. Often, it seems, the director tries to recreate the scenes that made the first ""Pirates"" so famous. For instance, the ""But, why is the rum gone?"" line is seen in one of Jack's early declarations ""Why is the rum always gone?"".<br/><br/>This film is a bit of a dilemma. You should watch the first film before you see this one, in order to get a lot of what goes on, however, if you have, the second is bound to be a bit of a disappointment. Just try your best not to compare them (like anyone could resist)."

","At last - a sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean! Dead Man's Chest features a few of the original film's features (a legendary pirate ship roaming the seas which is crewed by the undead) - and a few newer aspects - cannibalistic natives and the deep sea version of Nessie - the Kraken. The film starts with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann engaged and Captain Jack still roaming the seas with his crew. We have a few new arrivals - the little known but excellent Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd as Bootstrap Bill Turner and one of Captain Jack's ""fillies"" who trades unusual but useful items, Tia Dalma, played by Naomie Harris.

","This movie is good, however, it has not been thought out very well. Once the movie makers of a successful film decide to make a sequel, they should keep in mind how many sequels they will be making. <br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest was made keeping in mind that in yr 2007 they will release Pirates III. Thats Okay, as long as you know what do you want to show in part 2 and 3. Here, i think the makers had plan for a big part 2 film, started making it and then realized this movie will become 4 hour long. So they decide to chop it into 2 parts ... Now they wanted to build a plot for the 3rd part however without giving away the whole thing, so they kept dragging this one .... <br/><br/>First 35-40 mins are good, sensible, entertaining and refreshing, next 1.5 hours is drag ... simply stretching the concept by using gross costumes, acts and scenes.<br/><br/>No fun, no one liners, no thrill, I could have taken a nap for 30 mins and wouldn't have missed a thing. <br/><br/>As a movie goer, I don't like that. If you have something interesting than show it. Don't worry about the size of the movie.

","Mr. Depp, once again, has given me a reason to set foot in a theater. The story is brilliant (if you look at it as one of three, not a stand alone) and the acting is truly inspired. The CG effects are awe inspiring and the the scenery is breath taking. I recommend this movie for any pirate lover. It may be a little to scary for the kiddies at home, but definitely acceptable for the older youngin's. There are some scenes of violence that are not grotesque, but questionable. There is no sex, some kissing, but very clean. Some jokes are little ""grown-up"" for some kids, but the adults will definitely like them. I give this movie as thumbs up as I can.... which is only two, but if I had more I would give more! I love Johnny Depp even more now for this movie. He has proved himself again as a bankable star and a talented actor. I am glad people Finally realize his talent!"

The whole family, except very small children, will love it! You should see the first movie, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Black Pearl before seeing this one so you will be caught up on the story line. There are some funny moments in Dead Man's Chest that will be missed if you didn't see or have forgotten the first movie. Be prepared for a fairly long movie. The action keeps it going for adults but some children may get tired or frightened of some of the sea creatures.

If you are looking for a deep plot with profound undertones, sorry. If you are looking for another pirate adventure with everyone's favorite Capt'n Jack Saprrow, you have come the right place! Like the first movie (and the Indiana Jone's movies), this adventure departs from reality that take us on an entertaining journey through uncharted waters. The plot may be a little twisted or confusing (not really), but I think of movies like this as a ride. You get on and see where it takes you (hmm, kind of like the one at Disneyland :-D ).<br/><br/>Also, one should keep in mind that this is the second movie in a trilogy Don't be surprised (or upset) if this movie leaves you feeling like there is more to come (cough, ""The Empire Strikes Back"") because there is more to come, the last movie :-) And I can't wait!"

","To begin with, this is only half a movie. If you can accept that fact then this is a very entertaining and rewarding 150 minutes. Of course it isn't as good as the first one, at least not by itself. Dead Man's Chest, the sequel to Curse of the Black Pearl is actually part one of a two-part deal, and therefore it can't be compared fairly to the original Pirates movie until both parts have been released. Black Pearl managed to tell it's entire story concisely in just 153 minutes, and that is where the Dead Man's Chest falls slightly short of it's predecessor. In places it does feel a little stretched-out, for no good reason other than to split the story across two full-length films. Dead Man's Chest just isn't as concise as Black Pearl. BUT, the action scenes never drag, the pacing is for the most part pretty fast, and the characters are all as compelling as in the first movie. I would recommend this wholeheartedly. It's ending is actually far more satisfying and ""conclusive"" than the rather unsatisfying Superman Returns (which was a great film until the ending which left every major plot point unresolved. This is especially annoying as we are expected to wait until 2009 for the next installment!). Overall Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a very entertaining movie, and one which lived up to expectations, well ""half"" lived up to them anyway. I can't wait for the other half!"

","I am a huge Pirates fan. I saw the first movie 6 times in theaters, I own it, I love it. Seeing Dead Man's Chest was almost like Christmas morning for me I was so excited. The acting is good and the so is the story. Jonny Depp is nearly perfect, Keira Knightley is brining Elizabeth to a whole new depth, and Will is well... Will! Orlando Bloom does a decent job bringing such a previously minor character to place of greater importance. Keeping in mind that this is a Disney movie, there are no complex story lines or plot twists. Yet it was a great time. Johnny nailed the part of Captain Jack Sparrow perfectly and he is just too funny. We laughed the entire time both times we went to see it. If you are a loyal fan of Curse of the Black Pearl, go see Dead Man's Chest. If you haven't seen CotBP yet, watch it before you go see DMC or it wont be quite as funny because you wont understand the jokes.<br/><br/>This movie fully lived up to its ""Summer Blockbuster"" tag. I plan on seeing it again and again and again. It's fully worth the $7 to get in and see it."

","I thought it odd that the studio only in passing mentioned filming this movie at the same time as it's sequel prior to release. Other studios have not only touted filming double movies at the same time, they have been almost proud of the fact. Not in this case, Disney, and rightfully so, kept this low key. Why, because many movie goers would fore go seeing a movie, if they had any indication that they would have to spend another $9 in 6 months or a year, just to get some sort of a conclusion. <br/><br/>This movie was one ""cliche+1"" sword fight after another. In POTC: Black pearl, the stunts and fight scenes served to progress the plot and character development, here, it's solely to see ""What else can we do?"" What, you've seen two guys sword fighting? OK heres, 3 guys, on a beach. Oh wait we need stairs, stairs and sword fights look cool... OK .. how bout a wheel, and they can rotate fighting,, ewww how cool.<br/><br/>There were some rather cute, and funny little jokes here and there, with a handful of scenes from the ride thrown in obviously 'just cause', but in all, a fairly big disappointment. Not even close to the quality of the first."
"Skycoaster","6","2","3","9 July 2006"," All Swash, No Buckle
","As the climatic conclusion of this Pirates sequel approaches, there is an especially thrilling three-sword brawl between three of the main characters. They all fight for the same treasure, which many have killed for, given its value, but the duelers don't seem intent on killing each other. In fact, none of the attacks seem aimed towards killing, but rather towards grandstanding and making an ostentatious show of one's ability to balance on an ever-spinning waterwheel.<br/><br/>Thus is the spirit behind this inferior sequel that seems more intent on keeping us in awe at the stunts and/or special effects than giving us a cohesive story we can follow. The thrills are in surplus, true, but we still leave the theater with lots of unanswered questions, which I daresay will have to wait until Pirates 3.<br/><br/>But maybe I got my hopes up too high. Not an hour prior to my screening I had finished the first Pirates in hopes of refreshing the details of the story. Instead, I sat through Dead Man's Chest with disappointment where there otherwise would have been a more overwhelming excitement. It may have been the comparison to a superior film, but with all bias aside Dead Man's Chest crosses into the upper echelon far fewer times than its predecessor.<br/><br/>Not to say that it never does, though. In a complex and sometimes confusing webs of plots and character motivations, some brilliant and suspenseful moments break the surface, especially a jolt moment that would probably startle me again and a tense game of do-or-die Yahtzee. Such scenes are fueled by the improved performances from Orlando Bloom as Will Turner and Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann, and of course Johnny Depp's ebullient Jack Sparrow. All are seeking a chest containing the heart of Davey Jones, which, for some reason, enables the possessor to control the seas and thus the wealth that traverses it. Will wants it to save Elizabeth from a greedy lord's bum rap, Elizabeth wants it to save will from eternal servitude on the decks of Davey Jones' ship the Flying Dutchman, and Jack wants it to avoid paying his soul to Jones as a debt owed to him. Enter some cannibals, a giant octopus, and some characters of questionable origin and purpose, and you've got something decent enough to sit through, even for 2+ hours.<br/><br/>The final third of the trilogy may make everything clear, just as the last half of the first movie explained the storyline to a satisfactory degree, but this time the anticipation is not exactly killing me. Maybe next time it will not be so set up for a letdown, but one thing is for sure: Jack's got a lot more fighting to do. Savvy?"

","This movie is amazing. But if u read the plot of the next movie it doesn't really follow up. This movie is a thrill ride. There are ships sinking and people dying a horrible death. There is love and anger and deception. Jack appears to die at the hands of Davy Jone's Kraken and the Lord of the islands now possesses Davy's heart. There is a creepy voodoo like lady living in a swamp. The original Captain of The Pearl is back ready to lead Will and Elizabeth to the corners of the earth and beyond. I give it a 9.5 out of 10. P.S. The man who was originally engaged to Elizabeth is back as a scurvy mate on Jack's crew (Jack secretly wants to sacrifice one hundred souls to Davy Jones (to save his own soul). The former man of honor wants to deliver the heart to the new Lord and he does. Will meets his father on Davy Jone's ship "" The Flying Dutchman "" and vows to save his soul from the Dutchman by stabbing the heart of Davy Jones. Jack wants the heart to control Davy Jones. If you are wondering, Jones put his heart in the chest because of his one true love that isn't revealed in this movie."

If you liked the series finale of Seinfeld where EVERY character who was remotely important, funny, or had more than 3 lines is brought back, then this is your movie. And after reuniting the entire cast from the first film (even the pirates who turned back into humans and somehow are on the loose again) the movie steals its glamour from the first film. Not to mention that the film is sans-plot. Or...it HAS a plot that really fails to ever develop, climax, or go really anywhere in the 2 1/2 hours that the film runs. If Disney was looking to capitalize on special effects and run on the fame from the first (and much better film)...congrats... But I'll be renting the 3rd...4th...and....how ever many more..."

","I was one of the many that went to see the midnight showing on Thursday night. I, for one, saw the original in the theater when it first came out, and thought it was a great movie, I however wasn't prepared to say it was the best movie ever as so many of the population was saying. As such, I had never gotten around to buying the DVD.<br/><br/>I saw the teaser trailer for Pirates 2, back in Dec. when The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe came out. Being a Disney movie as well, of course it would be shown as a trailer. I have to admit the teaser really didn't show much of the movie at all, just enough to peak my interest. It wasn't until later I saw the full blown Theatrical Trailer that I decided that the second movie looked darker and better than the first one.<br/><br/>I bought my ticket around 9:00pm, and waited around for 3 hours to go see the movie, as i waited, more and more people showed up in line for the movie, a couple of kids even brought the first movie on a portable DVD player, and were watching it while they waited. Finally we were all herded into the theaters that were showing the movie, this is the third movie that I have seen now that used a Digital Projector. One of the managers came out to inform us we were in for a spectacular show, and thus the lights dimmed and the trailers began, and finally, the movie. Of the trailers the next movie I am excited to see is Lady in the Water.<br/><br/>I must admit that i wasn't completely sure what was going on in the beginning, since the movie begins with things in action, Will and Elizabeth being arrested for helping and consorting with pirates, mainly Jack Sparrow. Thus interrupting their wedding, Will goes searching for Captain Jack, to trade, Jack's compass for his and Elizabeth's lives to be spared from death. At the same time, Jack has just escaped from a prison to retrieve a drawing of a key, a key that he needs desperately, so that he may evade Davey Jone's Curse.<br/><br/>Many people have complained that Johnny Depp has less one liners than the first movie, and that the movie could have been better with more of Sparrow's famous lines. I actually think the fact that the first movie introduced Jack Sparrow with such gusto, is more than enough to make up for the lacking of lines, Johnny still played the slightly tipsy pirate as he had in the first, and where he had less one liners, he was a lot more genuine in his approach to the situations, this movie was more about him, and his dilemma, the stakes were much higher, so the small bits of comedic play really wasn't needed as much.<br/><br/>From the island of cannibals, to the visit of the Voodoo Woman, and from searching for the chest that the key goes to, to the climatic ending, which includes: a hilarious 3-way sword fight on a runaway water wheel, a death, a sinking, and a surprising resurrection, the second movie will blast all the other summer movies out of the box office this summer.<br/><br/>With a playing time of 2 hrs, 31 min. I was thinking that the movie was gonna be comparably shorter than Superman Returns, which itself clocks in at 2 hrs, 45 min. While Superman flew by, Dead Man's Chest felt as though it exceeded the length of Superman, I almost felt that the movie would never end, and it definitely felt as though i was in the seat for longer than 2 1/2hrs. When the movie ended so suddenly the way it did, i finally figured out why there was already a release date for the 3rd installment for next year. It was because Pirates of the Caribbean had finally entered the sacred realm of the movie trilogy. This movie does move sort of slowly in the beginning because of having to explain whats happening as it happens, but once the dilemma for the second movie is explained, the swashbuckling adventure begins with a quite a few surprising plot twists."
"Edu-16","5","2","3","9 July 2006"," Entertained at times - but overall, disappointed.
","I took our two girls (aged 9 and 8 and suitably decked out as pirates) to see what was for us an eagerly awaited sequel. Over-all I was disappointed, but I wouldn't go as far as to say 'don't bother'.<br/><br/>There are some great set pieces - that are amusing and well done. But the problem for me and my wife was that the film seemed to solely exist as a vehicle for these set pieces - with little or no attention to a narrative that reasonably took you from one to the next. This is something that the first film had going for it. The three-way sword fight was a great example of this - the motivations for why all three would now all want to kill one another - especially after the feeling of camaraderie at the end of the first film - was insufficient and unconvincing....<br/><br/>Second point was that although it was over 2.5 hrs long it seemed 'rushed'... For us the film never really 'breathed'..and lines were 'spilt' out, rather than enjoyed...<br/><br/>Third point I'd like to make is about Jack sparrow. In the first movie - despite appearing intoxicated most of the time - he was still clearly rather smart and had a sense of honour. In Dead man's chest he basically sells out William Turner - with no plan to return and rescue, and little sign of remorse... This is not the same man at all, and even a return to fight the Kraken at the end fails to make up for this for me... Plus - second time around the drunken word play, logic bits were verging on embarrassing I felt. I'm afraid the actor just didn't nail it for me this time around......or else maybe this character was only good for the one movie....<br/><br/>Hell - there are some laughs, and as I say the set pieces are brilliantly done. The kids loved it of course, and although I wasn't as disappointed (make that angry) as I was after Matrix 2, I don't think this a worthy successor to what was a marvellously entertaining original."

I thought it really was a good sequel. Often the sequel doesn't live up to the installment that precedes it, but happily this doesn't suffer that fate. The action scenes are well done, if a little absurd at times (just like in the first movie), and the pace keeps you going. At the end of the movie I couldn't believe I'd just sat there for that length of time. <br/><br/>The action and the pace kept up right until the final credits, which, for me, was the only downer in the movie: I don't like my movies that don't end. When the end came it felt like we were only halfway through, which is probably why there's still a Pirates 3 to come out. <br/><br/>But, all in all, it was great, can't wait for the 3rd episode, if only so we find out what happens."

"morganstaf1921","7","2","3","9 July 2006"," Somewhat disappointing in comparison to the original
","First, I'd like to say that the original movie is my favorite movie of all-time. So, of course, I've been dying to see this thing for a long time, as many of us have. I left the theatre with a very mixed reaction, but I'd say I was more disappointed than anything else. Rather than go on about how I don't like it, I'll give my honest reasons of exactly WHY I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot was interesting. I'll give it that. I was interested in the whole Davy Jones, Dead Man's Chest storyline. I enjoyed it, and I would liked to have seen a little more detail on the past of Davy Jones, and mainly a better explanation on his heart and how it ""controlled the sea"". When I sit down for a movie that is two and a half hours long, I don't want to have questions. I understand that there are supposed to be loose ends in order to build suspense for the third installment, but the plot just seemed to be a little incomplete.<br/><br/>The acting was solid. Johnny Depp didn't seem to be quite as good as he was in the first film, but I don't think that is his fault necessarily. The writing was good, but not quite as clever and witty as the first. I would have liked to seen even more humor. The audience seemed to really feed off of that, and it created a great atmosphere. I think that's what gave the first installment an edge- it wasn't just a good action movie. It mixed comedy with drama, action with romance. It had something for everyone, and yet it remained a family film. That's why everyone loved it. That's why it was nearly impossible for this film to be as good as it's prequel. That doesn't mean that this isn't a good movie. As far as good entertainment goes, it's about as good as it will get. Extremely entertaining. But it lacks that ""edge"" that the first film had, and it lacks that edge due to the plot and the writing that failed in comparison to the first film."

Jack Sparrow), Orlando Bloom ( Will Turner) & Keira Knightley ( Elizabeth Swann) were very well done, however, it was the plot itself that was non-existent. When the end of the movie finally came, it was disappointing as there was so much that was left not explained.It was the reappearance of one character from the previous movie that topped off a growing dislike for the movie. <br/><br/>To me, the movie felt like it was originally supposed to be 6 hours and just cut off and the 2 1/2 hour mark and then only given half the story. The acting, the visual effect *which are awesome, though a little bit over done in parts* are probably the best part of this plot less movie. It's a good movie to see, but don't go with high hopes as there's a pretty good chance that they'll be brought down. Despite this, I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the next movie and hoping that it makes up for this one."

","It's been three years of waiting and now Captain Jack Sparrow and his crew are back for more swashbuckling and adventure in the most highly anticipated sequel of the summer. This time, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley re-team with director Gore Verbinski to create a wild and crazy extension of the first film which includes more intense fight scenes, special effects, and (of course) a dabble of rum and romance.<br/><br/>In the film, Sparrow is the target of the slimy, squirmy Davey Jones; Sparrow owes him his soul and the only way to avoid serving a lifetime on Jones' ship is to find the chest that contains his heart. And what other way could this all be accomplished without the help of his friends Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner? Familiar faces and fresh ones as well round out the roster, including a run-in with a tribe of cannibals.<br/><br/>As expected, Johnny Depp performs above and beyond as Captain Jack. His comedic performance, as well as his serious one, set the tone for the film and keeps the audience rolling with laughter. Orlando Bloom still seems a bit stiff in his character, but it's definitely an improvement from the first film. And Keira Knightley blows her role out of the water, especially in her scenes with Depp. Finally, Bill Nighy's performance as the stunningly CGI-ed Davey Jones was incredible considering the fact that he was almost unrecognizable.<br/><br/>If anything, this sequel proves that Pirates can do no wrong. With a comedic darkness and a wonderfully tricky ending that only Disney could get away with, it's lucky that a third film lingers on the horizon for summer 2007. Until then, die-hard fans can settle for seeing the film multiple times this July. Take it from me- I saw it twice in the first 24 hours it was released. Yar matey!"
"Kitrich","7","2","3","9 July 2006"," Filler
","Captain Jack has returned and unfortunately there is not much to see. Pirates 2 is 40 minutes of story and nearly two hours of filler. While the first Pirates movie was wonderful, great story, fast pace, beautiful locations and awesome characters, Dead mans chest relies solely on the little nibble of the third film. It's an appetizer that is served cold, when it should have been pipping hot! There is only a few key scenes that advance the pirates story in any way, the rest is just a bunch of screen time shenanigans that aren't worthy of this tale. A film needs to be able to stand alone without its sequels, ala Indiana Jones and the temple of Doom, The Empire Strikes Back, and Police Academy 5. This installment is just a very long, and at times boring, trailer for Pirates 3."
"ellieuk","9","2","3","9 July 2006"," A Magnificent Romp
","It was always going to be tough to beat the 1st movie, to even equal the magnificence that is POTC 1 would be a challenge, but I think that this film eclipsed it!! Funny, Interesting, captivating and spectacular are all words that could be applied to the latest instalment of POTC. There are so many trilogy's that have failed their audiences at the second helping but I have to say that this movie was not one of them. There is more action, better special effects and a well written storyline that beautifully follows on from the first one. The humour is still present and correct, and further development of the characters only serves to make you love them even more. This movie feels more in depth. The first only served to skim over the surface of what these movies are about, setting up a taster of what is ahead. New characters enrich the movie and all of the actors (with the exception of Depp who is always captivating to watch) seem to have got better at what they do. POTC - Dead Man's Chest is a fantastic movie with an unexpected ending that leaves you begging for more - I personally cant wait until next summer and if I could I would book my seat now!!"
"jmplawecki","6","2","3","9 July 2006"," take my word for it
","OK. I'm 13 years old, and I'm one of Pirates of the Caribbean's biggest fans in the United States. The Curse of the Black Pearl is my favorite movie. I was psyched when I found out there was going to be a second movie. I read the book (which left out a lot). After months of waiting, it finally came out. <br/><br/>To be honest, I was a little disappointed. I hadn't expected it to be better than the first. That was purely impossible. But I had expected it to be pretty amazing. Just so you know, it was a very confusing movie. Don't get me wrong, it was still genius, just in its own way. It was a lot more grouse than the last one. It was gory and bloody and stuff. And the ending left the crowd hanging. Having read the book, I had known the fateful ending. It felt like it wanted to leave us hanging, hanging on until next May. And I'll be in that theater. I want to finish the story."
"PadmePrincess","9","2","3","9 July 2006"," great special effects!
","I think this movie had a darker feel about it than the first movie but i still thought it was great. This movie was a little scarier than the other movie but not enough to make u scream or faint. I did notice though that Keira Knightley's voice seems a lot higher in this movie than in the other 1. I think the middle of the movie was a little weak but the special effects throughout the movie were amazing. I think the best effects were the creatures in Davy Jones' crew. They looked very much like they came from the sea and so did Davy Jones himself. Even though this movie was slightly scary it was very funny in some parts such as Jack being a shishkabob (sp?). Overall i liked the movie very much even though i nearly fell asleep because i saw it at midnight of the day it came out. It is very action packed though and it is about two and a half hours long so be prepared to sit awhile. Enjoy it!"
"phosie","6","2","3","9 July 2006"," I prefer the original
","Well, in its own way I would say that it was a good film: the whole audience was laughing, particularly during the desert island scene, and it created a great atmosphere, with unforgettable moments being discussed all the way home.<br/><br/>However, compared to the original, I would say that all the hype that built it up spoilt it. Also, the number of plot holes, such as Barbossa's miraculous return, kinda spoilt it, as did the infamous Swann/Sparrow kiss that we had been eagerly awaiting: I find that too many films nowadays resort to love affairs. Also, it was historically incorrect, which disappointed me: it was Van der Decken, not Davy Jones, who captained the cursed Flying Dutchman, which cannot go to any old place: it haunts the Cape of Good Hope, where the Captain swore that he would conquer or spend eternity trying, and can't go any old place as is suggested in the film.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed laughing along with this film, but I found that the plot could have been researched more and patching up the holes that it created would have made it even more unforgettable."
"chrissanglin","7","2","3","9 July 2006"," The best part is the ending
","Admittedly Dead Man's Chest had a lot to live up to. And, as with most highly anticipated sequels it didn't live up to the hype. Overall, it was a fun movie, although I found the story weak and hard to follow until almost the very end of the film. The action sequences were great but sparse for a 2-1/2 hour movie. In my opinion, the special effects used on Davey Jones' crew was over done and unbelievable. The actors' performances were excellent as usual. Johnny Depp was fun and witty although it seemed that his drunken banter was much more limited than in the previous Pirates. Kiera Knightly was incredible and a joy to watch as always, and Orlando Bloom met all expectations as the hero. I have to say I was overall I was disappointed. The best part of the movie is the ending."

","Tired of dried up sequels and monotonous remakes? Not to worry. Cast and crew of this second in a BRAND NEW, never before read or seen trilogy, have catered to fan's hopes and beyond.<br/><br/>The movies' incredible eye-popping details shock, confound, amuse and at times send audience members cringing in unison with Captain Jack himself. This movie follows our favorite characters from the first Pirates film as they continue on with their endeavors and their destinies are woven out before them. With Sparrow restored to his command as captain of the Black Pearl, viewers witness what a pirate's brutal life plundering at sea is all about. You might even find yourself feeling as if you are aboard the long loved Pirates of the Caribbean ride a couple times.<br/><br/>Unlike previous trilogies such as Lord of the Rings, the makers of the Pirates films have no book to lean on whilst scripting and designing sets and scenes. Even so, an impossible amount of innovative detail was poured into this film as tastefully as hot maple syrup over a stack of pancakes. The originality and creative particulars are undeniably refreshing when so many movies continue to flow onto the big screen void of any resourcefulness and harboring painfully obvious plots.<br/><br/>The makers of Dead Man's Chest have delivered a spectacular and captivating film that will keep the wheels in your head spinning without being strictly serious. This movie's got humor, action, horror, adventure, fantasy, heck, even a spot of romance. It's a must see, and if anything will leave you entertained and poses the threat of drawing you back for more next year.<br/><br/>WARNING!!!

It rocks...definite see! It wasn't good when Elizabeth decided to put Jack in the middle of danger, but I have a feeling all will unfold in the last part of this great trilogy.

(one character especially, and you will love him/her all the more for it.) they all, of course, change a little according to the new plot, as any character must. but the personality we know and loved from each is still there, matured to just the right amount for a seamless and believable fit to the passage of time.<br/><br/>specifically the supporting cast, all the characters you loved and expected from the first film, and a few you may not expect, take the stage once more. it's as if none of them have even removed their pirate garb; so in-character is each one kept. and plenty of new characters also await; their stories told just as masterfully as the old ones first were, you soon know them and they blend perfectly into the new on-screen family they occupy.<br/><br/>the verdict? take everything that you loved about the first Pirates film, expand it twice over, and you will have ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest""; truly the original's greatness put to justice, as all sequels should.<br/><br/>big screen's the only way to see this one mate.

You pretty much get what you expect, but the visual effects are great and there is a lot of suspense and good action. I was on the edge of my seat most of the time.

If there aren't a baker's dozen Oscar nominations, then something is foul in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Yep, it was slow and dark at first. Yes, switching back and forth between the three leads was tedious. And the pacing was like an amusement park ride... up, up the rails... stall at the top... then flashing down, speeding around the curves, barely catching your breath before the next surprise. And there are major surprises on this coaster....<br/><br/>1) The Turner/Swann/Sparrow relationship heats up. Shades of Hans Solo/ Princess Leah/ Luke Skywalker! 2) So the local enforcer of the East India Company is in need of... a heart? Cue the corporate hatchet-man jokes.<br/><br/>3) It took looking at the IMDb credits to see that Bootstrap Bill and Davy Jones were two different actors. Bill Nighy is brilliant in anything he does, but Stellan Skarsgard snuck up on me. Hey, he and Keira Knightley were in King Arthur together. Good performances there, too.<br/><br/>4) Cudos for bringing back some of the original crew, including our... er... special guest. Excellent for POTC: World's End.<br/><br/>5) Special mention to Naomie Harris as the conjure woman. It seems I'll have to put on the closed caption to figure out half of what she said, but she did look suitably impressive.<br/><br/>6) The villains are even creepier than in POTC: Black Pearl.

"pswanson00","5","2","3","8 July 2006"," Inferior to the original
","Firstly, this film is too long. Secondly, it's very confusing. Thirdly, far too much of it is spent watching various configurations of computer-generated sea life. Fourthly, Johhny Depp has taken an exaggerated character and created a caricature of that exaggeration. The new Jack Sparrow appears even more than before to be in a constant state of intoxication, and has become quite effeminate, almost a Pirate Queen. I did appreciate the studio's small nods to old movies, especially Disney's own 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Davy Jones' organ-playing and the battles with a tentacled monster were both straight out of that film, and Orlando Bloom's sliding-down-the-sail-with-a- knife-stuck-through-it was lifted from Douglas Fairbanks Sr.'s silent The Black Pirate. Kevin Mcnally as Gibbs stole every scene in which he appeared, and was a major high point of the film for me. It was reassuring to see Geoffrey Rush at the end, as he gave me hope that the third -- and I hope, final -- ""P.O.C."" movie will be better than this one."
"Joe-93","5","2","3","8 July 2006"," Disappointing
","At the end of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, I remembered a line I had once read in a book: ""Disney is not in the business of making movies. Disney is in the business of making money."" This film demonstrates that fairly clearly--largely because of it's non-ending ending: at about 2 1/2 hours in, with things looking dire, with an important character seeming lost, I was thinking: ""All right, how are they going to tie this up?"" Well, they don't: they fade out, and this sequel to the marvelous first Pirates of the Caribbean becomes little more than a tease for the third film they've promised us. I know other film franchises have done the same: the Lord of the Rings series, the dual Star Wars trilogies (although the first set of three movies were each satisfying in their own right.) You would think, however, for the full price of a ticket, the filmmakers would be able to bring the current film to a satisfying close--but they don't.<br/><br/>Aside from that, this film is a pale shadow of the first. Its opening--in which Will Turner's and Elizabeth Swann's planned wedding is interrupted when the two are arrested for their part in helping Jack Sparrow escape at the end of the first PotC and then offered a deal, their lives in exchange for tracking down Sparrow--is creaky, as if the writers couldn't take the time or expend the effort to give us a proper set-up. From there, the story becomes confusing (even if you have seen the first, if you see this one, you should watch the earlier film just before going to the second, as characters pop up and the filmmakers clearly expect us to remember who they are from the first film to understand their significance in their scenes in this film) as the filmmakers are clearly interested in only providing the slimmest of threads to move the story from one big, rollicking scene to the next one--at the expense of clarity and an interesting structure.<br/><br/>There are scenes that are fun to watch, and Depp as Sparrow is as good as he was in the first (where his performance earned a deserved Oscar nomination), but you should do yourself a favor: see it at a bargain showing: half a movie doesn't deserve full price for a ticket."

"Matt_Crawley","7","2","3","8 July 2006"," Marvellous.
","I found Dead Man's Chest a thrill ride on so many levels - similarly to the first film. its a movie that does not necessarily have to 'make logical sense', it follows piratey stereotypes and seafarers mythology, and its a fun thrilling adventure in which we are meant to lose ourselves with its energy and imagination.<br/><br/>characters have become more dimensional this time, as the first film has already introduced them. of course Jack has the laughs, and memorable moments, and he is so much fun to watch. Yet it is not his movie - as he does in the first, he injects trouble everywhere he goes, of which the story is built upon. New characters, particularly Bill Nighy's Davey Jones, do not feel like 'filler', or character clones, but like everything else in this film, widens the POTC universe, as though we were journeying through the mythological canon of an ancient seafaring cultures. They all have a screen presence which excites. Acting, although not exactly award-standard, is at the right tone and consistency to make this a fun family adventure, rather than an emotional drama.<br/><br/>The CGI is consistently brilliant. Davey Jones is the 'gollum' of 2006. Sea monsters and flying tentacles are the real deal, and applause must go to the crew animating their butts off to bring us this convincing, wondrous world.<br/><br/>As i've said, its a thrill ride. sure, its long, and that may get people tired of it. But as it goes on, enjoy the ride with its twists and turns, and you'll be eager for the next. Word of advice though: pay attention to every word said by the characters, as so much happens in this film, and it is easy to at times be a little confused as to what has happened. Keep your ears peeled as well as your eyes. ;-)"
"ImagoDei","9","2","3","8 July 2006"," This is great film-making
","I loved everything about this movie. Every single frame was brilliant: the framing of the shot, the shot sequences, the sets, the makeup the wardrobe, the unbelievable Caribbean vistas... for example, a simple reaction shot of Beckett's face is imbued with surreality. Or the way Sparrow prances around like Bette Davis... a riot! Everything was brilliantly thought out and realized on the screen.<br/><br/>The story is complex on many levels, but the story is perfectly clear in the telling. It never skipped a beat from beginning to end. (In contrast to monstrosities like KONG... YIKES!) Seeing this movie affects you in the way the Treasure Island must have captivated boys in the 19th century. It just sucks you in, and makes you want to be part of its world. You could watch this film over and over and I think it would just get better with each viewing.<br/><br/>As I left the theater, all I could think when I let was ""WOW! How did they ever come up with all those great ideas!?!?"" And all this from a superlatively lame DisneyWorld ride! <br/><br/>My ONLY moment of ""awww, I don't buy THIS!"" was when we first meet Gibbs (Sparrow's first mate)... He seemed too well groomed: I couldn't ""smell him with my eyes,"" like all the other pirates. Luckily, he got gamier as the film went on! <br/><br/>I didn't give this movie a 10 because that score I reserve for one-of-a-kind or ""life-changing"" films (Annie Hall, My Dinner With Andre, Brazil, Mulholland Drive, Sling Blade).<br/><br/>But it was definitely a summer blast, every bit equal to if not better than the original."

It was great fun - everyone from the small children, teenagers, university students, adults and on up were good natured and enjoyed the film. This film shows us a new darker side of Captain Norrington, introduces some interesting new characters, and brings back a few old favorites. There's also lots of action, plot twists, great ""one liners,"" and a wonderfully choreographed sword fight. Downfalls to this movie? Johnny Depp seemed out of character (just not the same Jack Sparrow) and my favorite two British seamen were not in the movie.

","Pirates of The Caribbean Dead Mans Chest Takes is a twit of different plots from start to finish. Although I was afraid this movie would struggle because the story almost concluded in The Pearl, I was surprised to find that it was done quite well, having a great new plot with two completely new villains Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and Davy Jones and his crew of waterlogged miscreants. The story involves Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) and Will (Orlando Bloom) setting out on a quest to find Jack (Johnny Depp) to save their marriage and their freedom. Dead Mans Chest, although taking a while to warm up, has a much deeper and darker plot, exploring and deepening each character, twisting comedy, romance, horror and adventure all into the one movie. The last 10 minutes is very intense, and the end is a cliffhanger that makes you want Pirates of the Caribbean 3. Apart from this, the movie still has its funny bits and the same great humor form Cpt. Jack. It's a Great Ride, doing Black Pearl the justice that it deserves."

"johnnyboyz","6","1","1","25 August 2019"," Improving a little on the first entry, Dead Man's Chest is not dead on arrival.
","The stakes have been upped for ""Dead Man's Chest"", the 2006 sequel to the immensely popular, though I thought generally underwhelming, 2003 effort ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"": said Black Pearl, a haunted pirate galleon, has been replaced by the even more efficient Flying Dutchman; Geoff Rush's un-dead captain, Barbossa, and his motley crew of zombies have been replaced by a sadistic freak-show led by Bill Nighy, and the appearance of several new characters, not the mention the fleshing out of one or two old supporting ones, gives the film a broader sense of both scope and appeal.<br/><br/>The film is, I suppose, little more than a romp around a series of photogenic tropical islands, but is never-the-less good, clean honest fun; a sort of physical incarnation of all those games of Lego pirates & soldiers you might have played when you were younger on bases decked out to look like desert islands or within the confines of stone-carved fortresses you'd first have to build from the instructions. There were swords; muskets; treasure chests; an assortment of characters and palm trees housing monkeys you could clip on at funny angles.<br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest"" essentially covers the plights of two separate lead characters, a good looking clean-cut civilian with an honest trade, in Will Turner (Bloom), and a roguish, smooth-talking pirate in Jack Sparrow (Depp), whom nobody ever seems to truly get along with within the confines of the film yet nevertheless everybody loved within the public domain after his debut in the 2003 original. In the Bermudan town of Port Royal, stronghold it would appear of the British navy some two hundred years ago, and certainly in an alternate universe, Turner and his love, Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) are arrested on grounds of treason for helping a condemned man escape justice. The local governor hatches a plan to let them both go, but only on the grounds that Turner venture forth and bring back a particular compass belonging to Sparrow...<br/><br/>Sparrow, meanwhile, is busily making his own escape from a gruesome island prison which seems to be the sort of place that locks prisoners up and forgets about them, an early indication that the film is unafraid of going to some fairly nasty places. He is introduced as a resourceful chap prone to bursts of oddball comedy, playing dead and getting away in one of the many coffins prison employees are tossing away into the sea (something which calls to mind James Bond's escape from behind enemy lines in ""Octopussy"") before rather mercilessly shooting open the casket and wiping out a bird that had followed his vessel out to sea. Not too long after this, he encounters an island occupied by a tribe of cannibals who elevate him to a God-like status - a mere reflection of what the public did to him after Depp's initial performance.<br/><br/>As Turner seeks Sparrow's compass, Sparrow himself seeks the key to a certain treasure chest to whit only his compass will guide him. Hot on his heels for mostly unrelated reasons is Davy Jones (Nighy) himself and a crew of un-dead body-horror inclined psychopaths who look to settle a debt with him. And what a crew they are: barnacle and rot-covered fish-like creatures, wavy tentacles and pained expressions, involuntarily vomiting up seawater - disgusting to look at but a technical marvel within the confines of filmic imagery. One of these monsters, played by Stellan Skarsgård, turns out to be Will's father and it is surprising how affecting the scenes are between the two characters as they converse about their respective situations.<br/><br/>Broadly speaking, the film attempts to re-enact ""The Good, the Bad & the Ugly"" on water - vast, open swathes of desert become the open seas; horses are traded for boats and six-shooters become cutlasses. The American Civil War is substituted for some kind of battle for naval supremacy between rival factions. Director Gore Verbinski has a lot of fun encouraging the audience to root for Bloom's character to succeed in his mission and save the day so that he may go home and walk off into the sunset with his soul-mate, but that means forcing the audience to go against the character they like the most, which of course is Sparrow, who will meet a grizzly end at the hands of Davy Jones should he fail.<br/><br/>This interplay, like with the aforementioned Leone opus, between the varying sides keeps both the energy and interest levels high. It is something which culminates, of sorts, in a standout sequence involving three different characters sword fighting with each other across the beaches and forestry of a desert island; into the ruins of an old church and then on top of the most durable waterwheel in cinematic history. This is then further ramped up when members of Jones' gang turn up looking for something one of the initial three has on their person.<br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest"" is not great art, but it brings a smile to your face - whether that is through two pirates, who used to be un-dead, but are now alive, conversing about mortality, or via the head-spinning yet strangely steadfast logic of Jack Sparrow as he bargains his way out of another sticky situation, is up to you. For me, the film seemed to iron out all the problems I had with the first one, in terms of pacing and why I was supposed to at all care about those on screen, and run with a similarly magnetic approach, the likes of which I can't say I didn't enjoy."

"slightlymad22","7","1","1","12 March 2018"," Not A Patch On The First Movie
","Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to his first sequel (not counting his 19 seconds in Freddy's Dead) Pirates Of The Carribean: Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Because the first movie made so much money, it was inevitable we would get a sequel. It was also linevitable the sequel would be of inferior quality. The filmmakers decided to make two further instalments back-to-back. Since Empire Strikes Back, every film maker with an eye on a trilogy feels that the second movie must be darker than the first movie. <br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest is full of plot holes, inexplicable character actions and is not half as much fun as its predecessor. Pacing is a huge problem, the movie slogs through about hour of set-up before launching into its main story. For what is pretty much just a simple quest movie: find the key and chest, and use one to open the other, for the next 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I find it hard to figure how a movie with the central character of Captain Jack Sparrow could ever be anything but fun. Depp is in top form again, making Captain Jack the most dashing scoundrel since Han Solo (there is more than one similarity with Solo and his character arc).<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley is a bit more than the obligatory love interest she was in the first movie. This one takes Elizabeth's romantic life in an unexpected direction, as sparks fly between her and Jack (Even if she does not want to admit it) Knightley and Depp have decent chemistry. Knightley and Orlando Bloom do not. They are a much more interesting couple<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom's Will is not much more than he was in the first movie, the dashing hero. Bloom is more than ok, but he is often overshadowed by Depp and Knightley. Davy Jones represents a creepy villain (great CGI), Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport both return, as do the comedic duo of Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg as pirate versions of C3PO and R2D2. Yes, I know, another Star Wars nod.<br/><br/>The slow, uneven beginning is not really compensated for by the climax, which drags on about twenty minutes too long, with one scene after another, just leaving you feeling blah as it drags to the end credits. It's a common problem in movies these days, as the movie makers are more interested in putting scenes in movies, to put things in place for the next instalment rather than concentrating on one solid instalment. There were no further movies planned (though I'm sure Disney had hopes of a franchise) when the first movie was made, and it's to the movie's benefit. <br/><br/>Despite being nowhere near as fun or fresh as the first movie POTC: Dead Mans Chest grossed $423 million at the domestic box office to become the highest-grossing movie of 2006. Making it Depp's highest grossing and best performing movie. <br/><br/>For a time, this movie also held the box-office record for the highest opening weekend with $135,634,554 dollars earned."
"The_Hateful_Citizen","6","1","1","4 July 2017"," Not a good sequel
","The sequel of the excellent ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is for me missed. So yes, Johnny Deep is still very good, yes, the special effects are very good but that is not enough. Already, I must say, I don't like the fantastic. In the first opus, it didn't bother me but in this one I really didn't like and so Davy Jones is certainly very charismatic but I really didn't hang. Otherwise, it remains a sequel and I find that, even if one remains in the atmosphere of the first, there is disappointment. And if not, concern the end (which I would not spoil), personally, I'm not really hyped, even a little dubious. Well, it's not a bad movie but for me, it's not a good sequel. I hesitated between putting 7/10 or 6/10 but after seeing the third film of the saga, which I preferred but which is not worth more than 7 for me, I opted for a 6/10. Not a good sequel."
"ThomasDrufke","7","1","1","25 May 2017"," Doubles Down on Spectacle
","Sometimes it's really hard to see past a film's flaws. For whatever reason though, I really get a kick out of these Pirates adventures. Whether it be because I had fond memories of them when I was much younger, or because there just wasn't quite a spectacle like them in the mid-2000's, either way I still find Dead Man's Chest to be an admirable part of the franchise.<br/><br/>I'm not sure there will ever be a Pirates film as good as the first one. There's nothing quite like that first adventure with Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. And Dead Man's Chest wastes no time trying to top the spectacle and scope of that film. However, when the story and characters are second fiddle to the set pieces and grand action sequences, that's where you have the problem. In many ways, this film only exists to set up the third film. Most of the story beats are drawn out in what could be only one film's worth of story, but we don't get the payoff for any of it until the 3rd adventure. That's not necessarily always a bad thing, but I would have preferred each film to stand on its own a little bit more.<br/><br/>Although we don't get Geoffrey Rush's maniacal Captain Barbossa, we are treated with equally invested performances from Bill Nighy as Davy Jones and Stellan Skarsgard as Boostrap Bill. Jones', the main antagonist, is essentially a supernatural pirate with the ability to also control a large sea creature called, the Kraken. If you thought the original film takes advantage of the over-the-top side to the series, the second one doubles down. Luckily, Nighy is an absolute joy to watch on screen, thanks in large part due to the groundbreaking special effects of Jones & various other characters and creatures.<br/><br/>Much like the first film, Dead Man's Chest is a bit overlong and has too many moving parts. It worked with the first film because the script, directing, and performances were all brilliant. I think some of the magic wore off here because you definitely feel the length. But there's no denying the entertainment value if you enjoyed the first outing. The ridiculousness continues to an island of indigenous people wanting Jack Sparrow and subsequently a dog to be their ruler, a wheel barrow sword fight that goes on for like 15 minutes, and one great cliffhanger. I know they're silly, but I always manage to have a blast re-watching them.<br/><br/>+Doubles down on ridiculous action<br/><br/>+Mind-blowing special effects<br/><br/>+Cliffhanger<br/><br/>-Lengthy & too goofy at times<br/><br/>7.6/10"
"derbo73","5","1","1","21 December 2016"," As promised...
","the sequel delivers all that was sort of promised by the first movie. It's as overly long as the first one, shows the same characters without any kind of development, tons of undead fishy seamen, swashbuckling and endless dialogues and oh so funny comments.<br/><br/>The background story starts promising but ends in an endless game of ""I have the heart, no I have it..."". When the protagonists start fencing while balancing on a gigantic mill wheel rolling down the hillside I knew this was going down the drain.<br/><br/>The movie perfectly delivers the intended Disney theme park attitude and I guess you have to be in the mood and mindset of a 13 year old to fully enjoy it. That also explains why again this movie lacked real thrills or terror moments again, if undead seamen monsters are like this, I wonder what I was afraid of as a child. They looked ugly but not terrifying. They acted and talked as stupid as Laurel Hardy.<br/><br/>Costumes, sets, sfx were excellent, though. The music was too much on many scenes, rubbing it in. So, if being repetitive and without any innovation is considered a solid good delivery of entertainment, this movie is a 10er. Because of all that I rate it as a 5."

The second one they just abandoned all that except for when they were recycling the same exact jokes and schtick. The result is an effect-heavy movie where you don't care about the main characters half as much as you did before and every scene and plot twist just becomes more and more tiresome and predictable. <br/><br/>I don't know who the idiots are who are giving this 10/10 but they're the reason Hollywood continues to get away with this scam and ruins franchises"

"spacemandc","3","1","1","17 February 2012"," What a HUGE disappointment!
","Despite the phenomenal popularity of the (thus far) four installments of the ""Pirates of the Caribbean (POC)"" cinematic franchise, I've found it to be a monumental disappointment. Being such a fan of the original Disneyland ride ever since it first debuted back in 1967 (I once got off the ride and got right back in line for it seven times in a row), I can't tell you how eager and excited I was to run out and see the first POC installment, ""Curse of the Black Pearl,"" way back in 2003 especially since it starred one of my favorite cinematic actors, Johnny Depp. Oh how tragic to experience my initial eagerness and excitement quickly fade into bitter disappointment and frustration! What was immediately apparent to me was the almost complete disconnect between the vision and experience created by the ride and the vision now being projected up on the big screen. With all of its extravagant cinematography and special effects and over-the-top and even ridiculous characterizations of characters who never appeared in the ride, the film just didn't have the same creepy excitement and fantasy-world fun generated by the ride.<br/><br/>And these serious deficiencies have persisted throughout all three of the sequels. In particular, Johnny Depp's character of Jack Sparrow is just too fey, effete and just plain silly, Orlando Bloom (whom I despise) is too much of what he always is in every movie he's in – an inconsequential ""pretty boy"" that inspires absolutely no excitement or interest and Keira Knightly, a ""pretty bit of fluff"" who was ""force fed"" into the POC cinematic franchise purely out of political correctness, i.e., ""we (the writers and producers of the POC films) must make sure that the world of the pirate which has been traditionally portrayed as all male is properly ""updated"" in our productions to be politically correct in including at least one woman main character..."" Yes, there are the historical accounts of at least two very prominent women pirates, Anne Bonney and Mary Read, but I'm sure they didn't look or act anything like Keira Knightley's character – and she certainly was never even hinted at in the original Disneyland ride As a result, she is completely out of place and really detracts and distracts from the plot lines of all of the POC installments. She doesn't even work successfully as a ""love interest"" for Orlando Bloom or Johnny Depp as Olivia de Havilland did with Errol Flynn in ""Captain Blood"" or Maureen O'Hara did with EF and Anthony Quinn in ""Against All Flags"" since her (Knightley's) character suffers the confused split personality of being that of a butch female swashbuckler (completely unbelievable and stupid!) and a sexy feminine dish (much more likely)....<br/><br/>Out of a real dedication to my affection for the original ride, despite my bitter disappointment with the first installment, I've forced myself to see every one of the sequels hoping against hope that ""things would get better,"" i.e. the films would get closer to the look and spirit of the ride – and that Orlando Bloom and/or Keira Knightley would be killed off or otherwise just disappear! Praise be to Providence that this actually did come to pass in the third sequel – BUT it's too little too late and I'm still left with the feeling of a lover who has watched the ""perfect woman of his dreams"" become the ""the nightmare hag from hell"""
"KineticSeoul","6","1","1","9 May 2011"," Not a superior sequel, but still somewhat entertaining despite it being a bit longer than it should be with it's simple and narrow plot
","Johnny Depp is back as Jack Sparrow and he seemed to have a lot of fun playing this character as always. It's good to see the actors or actresses enjoying their roles, but that seemed to be mostly the main aspect of this movie. In fact watching this movie was like watching the characters running around a theme part and getting on crazy rides. But that just isn't really enough to engage the audience or make the story interesting or all that entertaining. In fact the main flaws of this movie is the plot, I know the creators are saving it for the 3rd movie but this one just lacked plot. It has one but it mostly revolves around Jack Sparrow and the other characters running around and acting all wacky in the jungle that seem a lot like some cool theme park. Some say the subplots in this are overlong and I sort of agree, but it wasn't really irritating to watch or anything and sort of had it's moments. This one has a bit more action compared to the first movie and I can see why it was a huge hit in box office. However the movie seemed a bit long with it's 2 and a half hour mark because of it's very simple and narrow plot.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"pzed","1","1","1","6 June 2008"," Laughably bad
","For as good a movie as Curse of the Black Pearl was, this film suffers the fate of so many sequels by forgetting that story is important. In the first movie, Johnny Depp struck a perfect balance with his portrayal of Sparrow, comic but not over the top. In Dead Man's Chest, he loses that sense of balance and becomes too much of a caricature. Then there's Elizabeth's sudden lack of love for Will and attraction to Jack instead. Not that you blame her, as Will is pretty painful, but it is a huge character departure from her obvious long suffering love in Black Pearl. <br/><br/>So, for me, the plot just becomes an excuse to set up Pirates 3, which I haven't seen and won't waste my time on. The only good thing is the reappearance of Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa who was sorely missed."

We all loved the action sequences and enjoyed the jokes that allude back to the first movie. I can honestly say that we were all entertained throughout. <br/><br/>It's just that the first movie was very character driven - yes, I know it had tons of good special effects - but, it was the characters, their development and relationships, that formed the connection between the audience and the movie. This movie, with its action and special effects, is a little like having a really sweet, chocolate desert for dinner. While you enjoy it and relish every bite, when you are finished there's just a vague sense of being left unsatisfied.... of wishing your meal had had a little more substance, a little less fluff. Still this movie was great fun and I'm looking forward to seeing the third movie."
"mellowstreet","4","5","12","6 July 2006"," Lamer than a pirate with a peg leg
","I am a big fan of Pirates I, the story was great, the action was terrific and Depp and Rush put in excellent performances. The only weak points in the first film were Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. For the life of me, I cannot see what all the fuss is about. They may be pretty to look at, but neither of them can act for toffee. Pirates II is a big let down. The story is laboured and convoluted. I think this may be because the film has to reunite Depp, Bloom and Knightley. Far better to have focused on Johnny Depp - audiences want to see Jack Sparrow not the supporting acts. Knightley and Bloom's agents must have been hard at work because this feels far more like an ensemble piece. I couldn't care less about Will Turner's dramatic reunion with his father or Knightley's take on the post-feminist swashbuckler. Leaving the acting aside for one moment, there are huge plot holes, gaps in logic, character inconsistency (for example; one minute the two comic relief pirates are happy to abandon our heroes, the next they're willing to sail to the ends of the Earth to save them), implausible motivation and unexplained gaps in time. Overall, it feels like a lazy script, which is a shame because I'm a big fan of the writers so I can only guess that it may have been over-developed by the studio. Directing is sharp and the special effects are great but CGI is a dime a dozen nowadays and audiences need strong stories, solid plot and good performances to engage them. Pirates II is a let down, rent Pirates I on DVD instead and remind yourself of how great it was."

They taped and scanned the audience the entire movie which I found really annoying.It was great to see the movie before the general public gets to see it, but the night vision video taping of the audience made me feel like I was under surveillance. <br/><br/>Overall the movie was well done with some great fight scenes and comic relief.I will not say much more since I cannot do so without ruining the plot for others."

Could have chopped off at least a half hour. The only thing positive about this overlong version was the special effects which were very good. Johnny Depp gave a very good performance as well as several members of the cast who I am not familiar with previously.

"MaxBorg89","7","4","9","17 July 2006"," Jack's back... Yo ho!!!!!
","Ah, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a wonderful film. It successfully resurrected the swashbuckler genre, became one of the highest-grossing movies of 2003 and received five Oscar nominations, including, for the first time, Best Actor for Johnny Depp (apparently, the Academy didn't notice three previous gems such as Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Donnie Brasco), who turned from indie poster-boy to Hollywood superstar. Oh yes, POTC was a great movie. And now the pirates have returned, bigger, but not always better, than ever!<br/><br/>This time, everybody's in trouble. Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth's (Keira Knightley) wedding day is ruined by the arrival of Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), a very unpleasant man who's been sent to arrest them for helping the notorious pirate Jack Sparrow, I'm sorry, Captain Jack Sparrow, escape from hanging. The couple's only chance to get a full pardon is to steal Jack's compass, which will lead Becket to the Dead Man's Chest, an object that gives its owner the power to control the sea. Jack (Johnny Depp), on the other hand, has gotten himself in an even worse situation. You see, in order to become captain of the Black Pearl, he made a deal with the demonic Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Now, thirteen years later, the Scottish pirate wants Jack to pay his debt, meaning our hero is supposed to serve on ghost-vessel The Flying Dutchman for 100 years. Unless Jack can get out of this mess, of course. Hence the need to retrieve the aforementioned chest...<br/><br/>Now, let's be honest. Pirates didn't need a sequel, since everything ended so perfectly and everyone got what he/she wanted. But who cares, when the continuation is, for the most part, a fun ride? Director Gore Verbinski and screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio have returned to familiar territory and expanded the mythology, creating a fascinating world which fuses elements of Indiana Jones and Star Wars (DMC has plenty of references to The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi, not to mention a threesome sword-fight that will make The Phantom Menace eat its heart out). And while they introduce new locations (a stunning cannibal island) and new threats (the half squid, half crab Jones, his ""fishy"" crew and his pet sea monster, the Kraken), they don't forget our old friends on the way. Supporting characters such as Commodore Norrington and the comic duo Pintel & Ragetti are given more space, while the protagonists carry the story without disappointing us. Will is still an honorable man, driven by love towards his fiancée and forced to deal with his father, ""Bootstrap"" Bill (a very human Stellan Skarsgård), who turns out to be not only alive, but also a member of Davy Jones' crew. Elizabeth still seeks adventure as well as a peaceful life with her man. The pirates are still a bunch of stinking rascals, and Jack... well, he's Jack! Constantly unreliable but charismatic, he steals the entire movie with no effort at all (although he has less screen-time than expected). From the moment he first shows up, you know you're in for something absolutely unforgettable. His performance is zany and brilliant enough to make the very long running time (two and a half hours) and occasional far-fetched twists seem less irritating than they should be. <br/><br/>If you loved the first movie, you just can't miss Dead Man's Chest. It may not be as fresh and well-crafted as its predecessor, but it is a good piece of entertainment and should raise expectations regarding the upcoming number 3.<br/><br/>6,5/10"
"scottrstokes","3","4","9","15 July 2006"," You can't be serious
","After watching this film today I was absolutely astounded to find so many positive, if not downright glowing, reviews on IMDb. This film was simply awful and, since I enjoyed the ""Black Pearl"" so much, immensely disappointing.<br/><br/>For starters, this thing is at least an hour too long. The length of the film is completely ridiculous, unnecessary and is almost as if Verbinski were infected with the same disease that ensures Peter Jackson will never shoot a film under 3 hours for the rest of his life. ""Dead Man's Chest"" is a mess. The story lacks any kind of cohesiveness and in a number of scenes I was left thinking yeah, the CG is cool, but why? What's even more irritating is that not one of the actors did anything less than a really good job. Depp is, of course, simultaneously dark and funny. Knightley is, of course, beautiful and seductive and somehow always looks classier than anyone around her. Bloom is, well, let's just agree that he fits the role and played to the limit of his abilities. What I noticed near the end of the film is what the cast lacked: Geoffry Rush. Rush provided something in the Pearl that Nighy, even with his considerable talent, couldn't possibly replace with his Davy Jones-in-a-green-suit bit.<br/><br/>I found myself bored and uninterested after the first twenty minutes. I think the bottom line for this one is CG effects and a previously successful film has very little to do with making a movie that's enjoyable. I sincerely hope Verbinski and crew will come to their collective senses before completely destroying what should be a great trilogy."

","When I stepped into the theatre to see ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"" I was excited for what I hoped would be an engaging sequel to one of the most successful pirate movies of all time.<br/><br/>Oh, how wrong I was. It seems that creators Gore Verbinski and Jerry Bruckheimer were more concerned with special effects than plot structure. I will be perfectly honest- the CGI was really cool. However, no amount of amazing CGI could make up for the sheer mediocrity of the plot. There was very little character development on any previously existing characters, but there were lots of new characters that just seemed to take up space.<br/><br/>Also, the movie is altogether too long. The scene I'm assuming to be the climax is about thirty minutes long, and I found myself wishing I would fall asleep.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the movie hooks you in, and by the end, you find yourself obligated to see the next sequel."
"Aaron1375","8","4","9","8 July 2006"," Captain Jack Sparrow is back and he has a debt to pay...
","This rather good movie as sequel to the sleeper hit Pirates of the Caribbean: the curse of the Black Pearl is not as good as its predecessor. Of course, this time it isn't a surprise as was the first one, it also has a very choppy flow to it that doesn't help. The plot goes here and there, to many characters introduced when all we came to see (well most of us anyway)is Captain Jack. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly return too and there is to much focus on them for my tastes, don't get me wrong they need to be in it, but more Jack please. Still you get action in the form of a rather cool sword fight in a water wheel, an aquatic sea monster attack, and other scenes like this and you get your comedy, the best bit coming near the start of the movie where Jack and his crew are in the clutches of a group of cannibals. So while this movie is not as good as the first for the most part, it is still a rather fun film that would have benefited with a shorter running time. It could easily be edited down a good fifteen minutes or so. Still there was a nice surprise at the end, at least for me, however IMDb kind of ruins it. Thankfully I didn't see that till tonight. So if you liked the first Pirates go see this one because while not the first one your still in for a treat, but be warned it ends in a cliffhanger."

","While many people, critics and movie-goers alike, have written off Pirates of the Caribbean 2 as a pointless sequel without the charm of the first movie, I say, ""So what?"" Yes, I admit that some of the more intense actions scenes were a little corny, and maybe the plot was overly complicated, but remember: this is an ACTION movie. People come to movies like these not only to see something entertaining, but also something exciting. Pirates 2 is an excellent example of this. Instead of the too-common problem of not enough plot and too much hitting, Pirates 2 has the perfect mixture. Enough plot to keep you focused, and enough action, special effects, and fancy swordplay to leave you feeling satisfied. People can be critical and say ""That couldn't happen."" and ""In real life they wouldn't have survived that."" but this isn't a reality show. Consider the plot of the first movie: cursed pirates that roam the seas forever looking for Aztec gold. How is that more realistic than this movie? All in all, if you are looking for a great movie to see this summer, and don't mind an open ending, go see this one."
"karatekid_crazed8","2","4","9","8 July 2006"," Unnecessarily creepy
","The first Pirates of the Caribbean was a real swash-buckling adventure! It was light-hearted enough to keep you from peeing your pants, but deep enough to keep you interested. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 lacks both of these. Sure there are some witty lines and funny moments ( for example, the cannibal inhabited island ), but these hardly make up for the dark, demonic scenes on the Flying Dutchman. Not to mention some pretty gruesome prosthetics. I found myself with my hands covering my eyes more than once during this movie. I was hoping for another swash buckling, light-hearted adventure. Instead I found myself waiting for daylight to come on the screen and praying that I wouldn't have night mares. The producers of this movie had a tough job in trying to make it as good as or better than the first. Unfortunately, they chose to go about doing this by making it scarier and more gruesome. More witty dialogue and involvement of relationships between characters is probably what was needed here. I think I may just be reading about what happens in the third movie."
"lukesifer","2","4","9","8 July 2006"," Not particularly good...
","I went in to the very first Pirates movie expecting to dislike it, and ended up enjoying it very much instead. Funny, exciting, and just plain enjoyable.<br/><br/>Imagine me quite sad to find then, that Pirates 2, in just about every way possible, is the total opposite of the original. After all is said and done, it can most damningly be summed up as flat out boring.<br/><br/>Oh yes, all out favorite characters are back, but the pacing and script are all over the place, and frankly it feels like we've already been there through most of it. We spend almost an hour with barely anything of note going on, and then for the remainder find the movie entangled in trilogy-itus. Plot line after plot line introduced, with no intention of wrapping thing up before we've gone on to see Pirates 3, coming out next year.<br/><br/>Which would be fine of course, if this movie remained action packed and entertaining on it's own, but aside from a few random sparks, and an ""almost there"" but not quite ending section, this movie failed to recapture the fun of the first for me.<br/><br/>Perhaps Pirates 3 can recapture the magic lost in what was essentially a 2 1/2 hour setup film, but I'm not particularly sure about that..."

","I work at a movie theatre where I have to test screen all the movies a couple nights before to make sure they run correctly. Anyways, I found the movie entertaining. The special effects were excellent and Depp was fantastic as always. I felt that Bloom was a little stale, but hey, may just be me. If it were up to me, I would have him in a nice sappy romcom with Jennifer Lopez. Keira dazzled.<br/><br/>Though the cliff hanger ending keeps me interested, it was no X-Men 3 ending or Itallian Job finish. I liked the jokes, but I felt that some of them were more references to the first movie and I would have preferred more originality in the script.

"honorhorror","9","3","6","29 December 2006"," Honestly done, with all elements promoted, however not flawless
","Wow the 3rd on the all-time worldwide box-office? You must be joking me! With such thoughts I went to see this big-budget, monster-cast, rumors-filling and long film.<br/><br/>My first impression is that I am forced into the plot comparing to the first one, in which I could develop a sense of the sail ship era and the real life of the pirates. It seems the director has his own confidence in making this one only to the fans to make money(and he succeeded, in such an abundant way). Now it is the consequence of Mr. Will Turner and his bride's actions in the end of the first film, very realistic.On the other hand, Jack has also escaped again in his cool and stylish way. But Jack's part meeting up with Old Turner is not so smooth. Such kind of strange feeling of the lines and the story-telling keeps coming up in the next two hours. For example the joke of cannibals chasing the dog, to me, is a little like a TV commercial. So does the chest-robbing scene. The characters and their behaviors are not driven by the story but simply driven by the need to amuse the audience with new tricks(like the big wheel fighting).<br/><br/>However, if you are doubting about my rating of this film, you are probably wrong. Let me speak it in this way: all those action-comedy actors like Charlie Chaplin, Jackie Chan and Gene Kelly would be awed by it. Dead Man's Chest is a conclusion and new avant-garde of its genre. It absorbed all the potentials in the Chaplin movies and Jackie Chan movies, and deserves the respect of other movie makers. The whole effect of the film has came out to be as viewable as LoTR. All the small pieces and beautiful scenes will prove your praise as to not only relax but also enlighten your eyes. It is honestly done.<br/><br/>The performances are also awesome. Orlando Bloom has for the first time amused me with his emotional act. Will Turner turned out to be a man standing on his own feet rather than some sort of lady-killer. I don't need to mention Johnny Depp but he did it again with all the means I can imagine and with so many means that I can't imagine. I have to admit he is a genius. So far, almost all the elements have been promoted. what did I miss? Oh, yes. The jokes. Some jokes really got me, like in the beginning when Will landed on the cannibal island, a parrot said to him, ""don't eat me."" And Will replied misunderstandingly, ""I'm not gonna eat you."" This is a smart one that you may be smart enough to prophet the following scene, yet I laughed for a while. Visual effects? I bet $1 on its Academy Award of Best Visual Effects 2007, for I already felt like to have a bite on Dick Jones' face(it must tastes good:) Overall, if you already read so much of my review, you can forget about my spoiler in the beginning. Happy new year 2007!"
"paladinmtk","2","3","6","22 September 2006"," Lame, boring, derivative, how did it make so much money?
","So how is this film the number 6 all-time USA box office champ? I have a clue. Its silliness caters to the short attention span public. Anyone who bothered to see Disney's 20,000 Leauges Under the Sea in the early 1960's or on video or late night TV will realize that this is an amalgam of that movie along with a bunch of other Disney and other action adventure movies. The action sequences are nothing new, the comedy is of the two peanuts were walking down the street and one of them was assaulted variety, and really, if you're going to have a big giant squid sea monster like the Kraken, spend enough on special effects to give us a nice shot of it, instead of more millions to Johnny Depp and Kiera Knightly's bank accounts. Saw that squid before in 20,000 Leauges Under the sea, anyways. Paper-thin plot, empty characterizations, Captain Jack Sparrow is an Attack of the C- Han Solo Clone. It is a sad, sad state of affairs. Pathetic. But for moneymaking ability, this movie has the pathogenic characteristics of an Ebola virus."
"biaassumpcao","5","3","6","20 September 2006"," A bit disappointing.
","A movie can't be only computer graphics effects. I really don't like movies that finish without an end. The ""krakon"" gave me less emotion that a movie with a killer octopus in the 70ties. The gags was not really funny, and the drama wasn't really developed or resolved. To be sincere, even the TV program I was watching before going to the cinema was more entertaining... I like Johny Deep, but I think the direction wasn't very convincing with the actors. They have the same strange movements and forced expressions, which is not very nice, you know, each character should have their own aspect. Another important thing is what the movie communicate. Is a children movie, concepts like compassion, justice, and fidelity are too much faded in my opinion. Is a pity, I was convinced I will like the movie but I got a bit disappointed."
"arslanmna","5","3","6","9 September 2006"," Gruesome & Ugly
","Take out the flamboyant ""Captain"" Jack Sparrow and lovely Keira Knightely and you have a visually disgusting movie left. Half of it has been shot in the dark with gruesome creatures trying to scare your wits and failing to do so. The first movie had a lively and adventurous spirit about it, which the makers have failed to recapture in this sequel. Let us hope that Pirates III revives the glory of Pirates I. Davy Jones was awful to look at and hard to hear. No match to Barbossa who was simply awesome. The movie starts at a snail's pace, continues at tortoise's speed and every one is really thankful when it finally ends."
"sugar_n_spice","6","3","6","7 September 2006"," Pretty good, but it has its flaws.
","Okay, let's start with the story. Jack Sparrow (sorry, *Captain*) has been captain of the Black Pearl for thirteen years (unlucky thirteen, as it were). Originally, he had made a deal with the sea himself, Davy Jones, to raise the ship from the depths of his locker (we don't find out the details of that, yet, but I'm sure they'll be answered in the third movie). The deal was that Jack would be captain for thirteen years only, and then be doomed to servitude on the Flying Dutchman (Davy Jones' ship). Now, his time is up, and Jack gets the ever-familiar 'black spot' on his hand, marking him as pray for the Kraken (Davy Jones' assassination minion of the depths of the sea) if he should defy his deal.<br/><br/>Now for everybody else: Will and Elizabeth are about to get married in the very beginning, but a certain Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company has put out arrest warrants for them both (for helping Jack escape the hangman's noose, for which their crime shares the exact same punishment), and one for Jack (for his crimes mentioned in the first movie), and even one for the *former* Commodore James Norrington (his conditions are a bit more fuzzy)! The deal Lord Beckett makes with Will is that, if he gets a certain 'compass' from Captain Jack, then Will and Elizabeth will both be pardoned (Norrington has been nowhere to be found for the past few weeks). Too bad Lord Beckett has a hidden agenda...<br/><br/>Now, that's the beginning, and I'm going to stop there, because I don't want to post any spoilers. So, with this in mind, forgive me for being a bit evasive as I give my analysis: Captain Jack changes quite a bit in this movie. He's much less decisive about what he needs to do with his strategies (and a bit sloppy with them), and his heart seems to always be torn in two (you'll see what I'm talking about during the course of the movie). Overall I see this as a negative impact for the movie, but it may turn positive in the third, showing that he is indeed 'growing'.<br/><br/>Will is actually an improvement, in my honest opinion. He was the classically adorable, lovesick puppy in Curse of the Black Pearl, but much more of an adult in Dead Man's Chest. He seems to have lived more in this movie, and experienced a whole lot (like all of the events of the first movie). Though some may say Orlando Bloom's acting is wooden, I *completely* disagree! I think he portrayed a very 'real' (no other word to describe it) person as Will Turner, without you feeling like you're even watching an actor, but the actual person Will Turner, ups and downs both.<br/><br/>Elizabeth, pardon my English, is a major S-L-U-T in this movie. She mentions toward the beginning how Lord Beckett ""robbed her of her wedding night"" (the least ladylike thing she could possibly say in front of company). She flirts with nearly every guy she meets in this movie (Jack most certainly included, if you can believe it!), and throws herself at a couple of them (literally). Total downhill spiral from the first movie, making Elizabeth a rich and promiscuous snob (never a good combination for a movie heroine).<br/><br/>Norrington is a MAJOR plus! He pitches the white wig that made him look like an ice cream cone in the first movie, and becomes... well, *piratey*, if you can believe it! His personality has many different sides here, with conflicting desires (including a possible remaining love for Elizabeth?) and motivations. And also--and this is not something to criticize the movie with, but my own heterosexual female opinion--Norrington was incredibly HOT!<br/><br/>The new bad guy, Davy Jones, is another negative. His story is explained (such as how he became an immortal sea-like creature), but his motivations and desires are rather fuzzy. Barbossa from the first movie was a much better villain: you knew that what he was doing was evil, and that Jack needed to defeat him for the movie to be happy, but you understood *why* Barbossa did what he did in Curse of the Black Pearl--to feel like a human being again! (And, be honest, you sympathized with him a bit.) Davy Jones, on the other hand, is much colder than Barbossa (and not in a good way), much crueler, and offers you no outlet for sympathy, making the storyline more one-sided. That's not to say Bill Nighy was bad for the role (he portrayed him very well, actually), but the character himself was a downside.<br/><br/>All in all, with the above story and character analysis, I give this movie 6/10 stars."
"tiger-lily-2","6","3","6","31 August 2006"," I expected something better
","I had enjoyed the first part a lot. The story was fun, the script was good and had Johnny Depp in it. Add pop corn to that and you'll have a nice Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>So when I went to see the sequel I didn't find most of the ingredients I enjoyed in the first one: the story was dull, the script was bad but still had Johnny Depp in it, which wasn't enough by itself to digest the rest.<br/><br/>In this second movie I also found Keira Knightley's acting much worse. But there was a new character I liked a lot, Tia Dalma, which was very well played by Naomie Harris.<br/><br/>Well, I think that with all the money spent in this movie, they could have come up with something better."

This film is extremely impressive, especially when comparing it to the first Pirates of the Caribbean. If you haven't watched it yet, get off your bum and buy a ticket!<br/><br/>Johnny Depp leads you into an amazing movie with his unique character and attitude. He truly accomplished his goal of making a 3 year old sitting next to a 50 year old both laugh at scenes for the same reason. After watching this second movie, it is confirmed that he is my favorite character. <br/><br/>The first of this series of movies was not quite impressive. It was more of a kid family movie and did not entertain the older crowds and the graphics seemed too childish. However, this movie has an amazing plot and is definitely worth your money!

","I had seen the curse of the black pearl at least 25 times before, so the expectations from this movie was really high. So when i watched the Dead Man's Chest i can say that the action in this movie is far less than the first one. So sometimes the movie's pace slackens a little bit but the comedy in this movie keeps you glued to the screen. The laughs in this movie is more than its predecessor. <br/><br/>If the comparison is done to 'black pearl' then it can be said that black pearl was better than the dead man's chest in terms of the action sequences but dead man's chest provides you more laughs than the black pearl. But where this movie is far ahead of the 'black pearl'is its climax. The way this movie has ended is simply superb. The climax would keep one waiting anxiously for the third part in the series. <br/><br/>All in all this movie lags behind in some aspects and is far ahead in some aspects of its predecessor. But still because of the climax it is a proper sequel to black pearl and now lets hope in the third part also the good work is continued."

Although it might've been funny as well if they hadn't shown who the guy was, and saved that for the 3rd film. Davy Jones was freaky, but he wasn't half as frightening as the Kraken. Whoah, me and my friends were really screaming at some point in the film, it was sooo scary! I believe you can absolutely call this a great sequel, as most turn out worse than the first part, or don't even make it to the cinema.. Oh yeah, Captain Jack Sparrow is fantastic. The way he walks, talks and acts.. It's awesome! Especially the things such as Savvy? And the thing with the cannibals, where he says: ""This is the day you shall always remember as the day that you almost... *splash* Captain Jack Sparrow"" It's so funny! I turned into a Johnny Depp fan instantly! But he doesn't make the film on his own, although his personality and character make up a great part. The return of Ex Commodore Norrington was quite a surprise I must say, although I had wished for anyone BUT him to get the heart.. Terrible that is!"
"No_Quarter","5","3","6","16 August 2006"," Bad movie - HUGELY disappointing sequel
","SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I absolutely loved POTC1. I thought it was one of the most entertaining films I have seen in a lot of years. It had that light-hearted, fresh sense of adventure that was missing from modern adventure films. It was, fun, tight, witty, and overall very charming.<br/><br/>As with most sequels, I expected to be worst than the first. I expected a worse screenplay, script, some repetitive jokes, and probably a less brilliant performance by the actors. And while I expected those things, I hoped that since POTC1 managed to be so surprisingly enjoyable and fresh, maybe there was hope for the second one as well.<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer for POTC2 I knew we were in for trouble. However, I did not expect was that all my worse fears (the ones I mentioned at the end of the previous paragraph) would be negatively surpassed.<br/><br/>End of prologue, on to the actual POTC2 review.<br/><br/>As most of the other negative reviewers have said so far, this movie is a 2.5 hour long trailer for POTC3. I think that this characterisation best summarises the movie.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest flaw of the movie, which is a summary of the flaws in various aspects of it, is that it is DULL. It is boring. It is predictable, repetitive, and frankly too long. I have no problem at all with long movies. I actually prefer longer movies than shorter ones, if the extra running time is used to contribute value to the film. This is not the case in this one.<br/><br/>The jokes were, 90% of the time, not funny. The rum joke from the 1st one made three appearances (maybe more I wasn't actually counting). Johnny Depp, which was the greatest asset of the 1st one, was a shadow of his former self. His character did not actually do anything in this film. Whenever there was an important decision or action to be made, Sparrow was either fleeing (not like pretending to retreat, but actually fleeing) or just simply following the other characters around the seven seas. He was passive, cowardly, not as witty, and surprisingly, in contrast to the character of the 1st movie, a bit evil (well as evil as the lead in a Disney movie can be). Although I do not like the character development towards this direction, I could respect the decision (assuming it was a conscious decision) as long as it was performed adequately. Unfortunately, due to the horrendous editing, Captain Jack Sparrow has a rather minor role, considering he is the lead, and his main responsibility in the movie is to be the comic relief by repeating clichÃ©d one-liners, most of them taken verbatim from the 1st movie.<br/><br/>So with Johnny Depp down for the count, what hope is for the rest of the movie? Orlando Bloom was more or less as inadequate as in the first one (though I do not think he was THAT bad). Keira Knightley was I think the same as in the 1st one. I have to note that the plot with her lust for Jack was interesting as a concept, though poorly executed. The film seriously lacked Rush's Barbosa. His replacement, the squid-like Davy Jones was nowhere near in charisma. This brings me to another important problem that seems to plague all modern action films. Over reliance on CGI.<br/><br/>Seriously, I mean, enough already!!! Squid like main antagonist? Fish-men pirates?? COME ON! While the work done on CGI was good, the concept in itself was plain wrong. The skeleton pirates from the first were a great gimmick. You could have them as real people most of the time, thus enhancing the swashbuckling experience and dialing off some of the fantasy aspect of the film, and at the opportune moment bring forth the skeleton alter egos. But in this one, we had to suffer through gross fish-pirate abominations for the whole of the film.<br/><br/>And then there was the Kraken which made its appearance at least three times, destroying three ships. Okay, I get it... The Kraken is a bad Mofo. ENOUGH ALREADY! Seriously, come on now... THREE TIMES the SAME action sequence?!?! I understand that the producers want to make the script for one movie last for two, but that level of retentiveness is just plainly offending.<br/><br/>The general plot was as thin as they come. The sub plots with the West India trading company, the cannibals, the love triangle, the compass, and Turner Sr. are all introduced but left dangling even after 2.5 hours so the movie is at the end pretty much where it started in terms of plot development.<br/><br/>And another thing... Why can't there be a normal sword-fight in a film anymore? In Revenge of the Sith the sword-fight that should end all swordfights (Obi-Wan VS Anakin) was bastardised by annoying CGI, droids, and lava. In POTC2 the potentially interesting concept of a three way duel, was turned into a CGI fest by introducing a spinning wheel and whole lotta running (mostly done by Sparrow who seems to be rivaling Forest Gump at this point). Sad, truly sad. Do not believe what other people tell you. There was NOT an actual sword-fight in this film. Sure, swords were drawn and sometimes they were crossed with one another but in all honesty I cannot say that there was a sword-fight in this film.<br/><br/>Anyway, to sum up. Bad story. Worse Directing. AWFUL Editing (which seems to be a common problem in the action films of the last 7 years). Mediocre Depp. No Barbosa. TOO much CGI. Inadequate screenplay. Lots of filler material. No payoff. And on a personal note I did not like the darker direction that the film took. Maybe if it was actually done well they might create an Empiresque sequel. I miss the fun and excitement that the first one had."
"tankeredbell","5","3","6","16 August 2006"," It wasn't that this movie was bad...
","It just lacked what we all thought it could bring to the table. I don't think this movie was bad but after seeing the first, the unusual role Johnny Depp created, the insane hype of the second film and the general hype of the movie itself we as the audience expected sooo much more. Though more of what? It had great battle scenes, comedy, mild horror and romance, so what was it really missing? To this day I don't know, but I do know that more often than not people were harshly disappointed in it. A part of it for me was the numerous references to the first one, whether it be the dog with the keys, the ""CAPTAIN jack sparrow"", the midget (I'm not being critical of the midget but they used him for comedy to the point where it was like, 'are we laughing AT him or with him?') They tried too hard to make the movie funny. The best parts of the movie was the introduction of Mr. Turner, Davy Jones' role and the cliffhanger at the end. It wasn't worth the wait, definitely not worth 10.50 and REALLY not worth sitting for 3 hours in those painfully structured seats."
"nrc3688","3","3","6","15 August 2006"," Very similar to the energizer bunny
","I loved the first Pirates movie. It was a tad long, but it had enough fresh material to sustain itself for that long. I thought the characters were lovable, the premise was involving, the dialog was interesting, and the visual effects were amazing. All the first movie basically wanted to do was give you a fun ride, and it most certainly delivered.<br/><br/>Then came the sequel. I've always been suspicious when it comes to sequels, but enough of my friends told me it was excellent that all my fears were repressed and I made a point to see it as soon as I could. What I saw was a self-absorbed slog through an over-the-top interpretation of the more delightful aspects of the first movie. I say interpretation because nothing seemed to same to me as it was in the first movie. For example, Captain Jack was well played in the first movie as a chap whose brain may have been slightly toasted, but nonetheless was witty and charismatic and always seemed more or less like he knew what he was doing most of the time. In the sequel they chose to magnify and distort two of his main features: his general manner, which is depicted here as either incompetence or desperate flails at childish slapstick, and his wit, which is cheapened to ""big words"" and ""shock-value-cause-they're-so-out-of-character"" remarks like, ""You smell funny!"". That was just a rundown of Sparrow, but pretty much every character has undergone a similar deadening transformation in this film.<br/><br/>But why get so analytical about a movie that's meant to appeal to the popcorn crowd, you say? Because I think this movie is insulting to the mind. It expects us to simply accept everything that's happening on the screen without questioning the inconsistency-ridden progression at all. I found it especially difficult to stay interested in the least while every single fight scene dragged on.. and on.. and on... and ON. Consider a brilliant sequence involving THREE MAIN CHARACTERS (which is a title equivalent to a cinematic ""get out of death free"" card) in a badly choreographed three-way sword fight that lasts for about 10 minutes. Or maybe longer, I wasn't timing it.<br/><br/>The basic plot is decent, but this movie really is not about its plot. It's about Disney capitalizing on the charm of the first movie by saying, ""You want more? HERE YOU GO!"" and shoving this load of extravagantly adorned crap in our faces. This was truly a movie put together on the basis of demographics and financial predictions."

","STAR RATING: ***** Jodie Marsh **** Michelle Marsh *** Kym Marsh ** Rodney Marsh * Hackney Marsh <br/><br/>Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are about to celebrate their wedding day- when suddenly they are arrested for aiding in the escape of pirate Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp.) Now facing the death penalty themselves, Will is bargained a pardon- if he can locate a map that will show the key to unlocking a pirates wet dream of treasure for the East India Trading Company. With no choice but to agree he sets off to find Jack and locate the gold- but Jack's got problems of his own, namely an unpaid debt to feared pirate Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) that will see him cursed to eternal damnation in hell if it is not settled.<br/><br/>Following the massive success of the original POTC in 2003, the sequel was just screaming out to be seen. But, riding arrogantly high on the commercial and critical success of the last film, this time round it appears the original film's director, Gore Verbinski, has got carried away with himself and made a very self indulgent sequel. Overlong, messy and convoluted, Dead Man's Chest simply doesn't sail the shaky tides as well as it's predecessor, creating an uneven and unfocused film that fails to sustain an interest during it's lengthy running time. I don't think I fell asleep at any point, but there was a period where it was as if I simply switched off and a large segment of the film just got blanked out in my mind.<br/><br/>The cast are back on (mostly) good form. Johnny Depp once again crafts a very engaging and enthralling character in Jack Sparrow, a wise-cracking, charismatic rogue in everyone's bad books and Keira Knightley also returns as the heroine Elizabeth Swann, strikingly beautiful and very agreeable in the role. In the main cast, only Bloom fails to strike a chord, rather wooden and bland as the main hero. The film boasts quite an impressive supporting cast in general, from Nighy to Mackenzie Crook and Johnathon Pryce (wasted) as Elizabeth's father. But there's a weird sub-plot of them all double-crossing each other and doing anything to come out on top, as opposed to the last film where they all shared a jolly, merry camaraderie together. The film ends leaving the room open perfectly for the next film in the series but in doing so fails to provide a satisfactory ending to an already piecemeal and lacklustre story.<br/><br/>In between everything, the special effects and action sequences have quite a neat flare to them and the script madly races along trying to keep everything above water. But where the first film set sail with a mighty roar, the first sequel seems to get lost at the Bermuda Triangle. **"

","I have to start off by saying this... It NEVER crossed my mind to even see these films. That is until I visited my daughters in Valdosta, Ga. I wanted to do some quality time things with them and they both suggested going to a movie. My ex suggested Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I hadn't seen the first one, so we went and bought Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. We all watched it that night over pizza.... needless to say I had made a mistake as to not even THINK of watching these films. I was riveted by the visual effects and the action and acting. BTW... way to go Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley... an Oscar worthy nod to all of you! I laughed and cried and waved my hand to my mouth in surprise and awe at the way this film 'epic' splayed across the screen. I was hooked from the word ""GO."" It was Pirate Dreams all night long! The next day we went to see the next film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. Again I was riveted! The action, acting and, well the visual effects got even better than the last! I do have to say that the humor in the second film rammed a steel rod right up my funny bone! Another great film indeed! I suggest these films as a great family outing!"

","Swashbuckling Pirate sword fights, cursed Pirate ships, what could be more exciting? Not much! This movie is an excellent source of excitement, mystery, and ""on the end-of-your-seat"" thrill. <br/><br/>They did such a good job of connecting the mysteries and events of the first movie to the second. Pirates- Dead Man's Chest is such an excellent squeal to the first movie that I could not imagine how great the 3rd will be. <br/><br/>This movie would not turn out the way it did and will turn out without this excellent set of cast members. Their performances were outstanding. Johnny Depp along with Orlando Bloom could not have portrayed their characters any better. <br/><br/>It would be really hard for someone to be disappointed with this movie. The cliff-hangers and the incredible line of cast members is what makes this movie unforgettable and you anxious to see the next. The plot could not have been better, the witty lines said by characters,the cast themselves, and the incredible graphics should surely win this amazing movie an Oscar. I advise everyone to try this movie out , I guarantee you a fun time."

The CGI graphics were just breath-taking. The new characters in this film are some to admire, no doubt! There are also a few scenes that may shock a few who have come to love the first film...<br/><br/>Anyways, I give this movie a 10 through and through! I hope you all enjoyed it as much as I have!"
"Corky1984","Null","3","6","11 August 2006"," Far too long
","This is not a terrible film, but it does disappoint. To be honest, its just far too long and repetitive. The film essentially consists of a series of endless chases, hammy swordfights and the odd pout from the beautiful Keira Knightley. The film struggled to hold kids attention in the cinema where I saw it: they were in and out like tramps on a kipper! The film is oddly paced, with a bit of slow, dull speech followed by what seems like an eternal 'caper' of some sort. The plot revolves around Captain Jack (even more over-the-top than film one) having to repay a debt to Davey Jones, a squid-like pirate blah blah blah. The film ends on a cliffhanger which cries out 'money spinning third film on the way' as blatantly as could be. There is no reason why this shouldn't have been around 90-100 mins long. Tightly edited it would have bounced along at a decent pace and would have been more enjoyable. The special effects were reasonable I suppose. The sea monster style pirates looked interesting, but the great cracken beast which acts as the film's scary element (for kids) looked rather pathetic and was clearly superimposed onto the screen, but such is the way with CGI nonsense. Film one was harmless pap and this is too. A shame really. I would admit, however, that the odd scene will make you laugh. At the start, Captain Jack escapes from a coffin in a pretty amusing manner...but if that's a film's highlight...oh dear!"
"misko14","8","3","6","10 August 2006"," Impressive
","OK, this one has over 1000 reviews so far so I'm not going to write a complete review. Instead let me highlight one positive and one negative aspect of this movie.<br/><br/>The good: The special effects in this movie are honestly the most impressing thing I've ever seen. The movie is worth seeing just alone for this reason.<br/><br/>The way they present the ghost pirates, the huge octopus and the impressive surroundings is breathtaking. This is a heroic effort! The bad: This movie suffers from the ""this is second part but we already know that we will do another one""-syndrome. The first Pirates movie felt a lot more fulfilled with no annoying ""see you later"" ending. The last 30 minutes in this one, are basically a setup for the third movie.<br/><br/>If you're not sure what I mean, compare this with the Matrix trilogy. The same thing happened in Reloaded.<br/><br/>Overall, this is great movie that is a worthy follow-up to the original Pirates of Carribbean. I'll give it 8 out of 10 Molotov cocktails."
"clandestine_kiddo","10","3","6","7 August 2006"," wow!!!!
","I have seen this amazing movie twice. The only reason that I have not seen it more is because none of my friends want to sit in a two-and-a-half hour movie and listen to me rave on and on about Johnny Depp. The first time I saw this movie was the second day that it opened. If I had it my way, I would have seen it at the midnight showing that Thursday night. I knew there were going to be tons of people there so I just decided to stay away until the second day. As soon as it started, I could not stop watching it!!! This movie is by far the best movie in the entire world!!! I absolutely Loved Jack's entrance in this one! As soon as I saw what the bird was doing I screamed out loud... ""Oh My God..... it's Jack!!!!"" I wouldn't have been surprised if they kicked me out of the theater but I am so glad that they didn't! I was absolutely amazed by all of the sword fights in this one!!!! And the whole thing about curiosity between Elizabeth and Jack was like one of those Whoa! hit you in the face kind of moments! I am so anxious and overly excited about the third and final installment of Pirates that comes out next summer.<br/><br/>Of course the main question to be answered here is...... Does DMC live up to the original? My answer: Oh My God yes!!! Furthermore, I think that Johnny Depp is amazingly remarkable!!! I think he should win a bazillion awards for the Pirates movies. He really does do an amazing job!!!"
"keynes360","2","3","6","7 August 2006"," One move for the price of two.
","The writers had a great story. Then, some guy from accounting says they need more revenue. Turn it into two movies by adding a lot of irrelevant scenes and special effects. This movie could be done in 30-45 minutes. Expect the same for the (hopefully) final sequel, but will at least have closure. I should have been more astute when they were already filming the finale.<br/><br/>This movie contains irrelevant scenes. Do we need to see an octopus attack three times? Was it necessary to show the natives? I was hoping for things to come back and tie in, but instead we get an arrogant grin from old Captain. I couldn't even understand the Jamaican woman's lines to appreciate what was going to happen, but when it did, I realized it wasn't important. I felt it went in circles."

"beezer1970","2","3","6","6 August 2006"," Worst Sequel since the Matrix
","This film lacked everything that made the The Curse of the Black Pearl enjoyable and an overabundance of what made it less than stellar. I enjoyed the Curse of the Black Pearl a great deal but felt it walked a fine line between realism and supernaturalism without delving too far overboard. It had abundant, well-choreographed action sequences (except the first duel between Jack & Will which was too over the top), good character interaction, a good plot, and believably ruthless pirates.<br/><br/>Dead Mans Chest has none of these. Characters have seemingly become more simple minded, the action sequences are too far apart and were all overly extravagant, the dialog was uninteresting, but the worst part of all had to be Davey Jones and the pirates of The Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>When I first saw Bootsrap Bill with mollusks growing out of his neck, I accepted that being among the undead, perhaps this could have been reasonable. But to have Davey Jones head be an octopus, and his first mate having a hammerhead shark head was just too far removed from reality to allow me to engage in these characters and took me out of the film.<br/><br/>Taking the POTC franchise deeper into the realm of supernaturalism was unnecessary, and will ultimately doom the franchise. Had it been grounded more in realism, then the franchise would be able to survive even without characters like Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann. POTC could have been a franchise that contained overlapping characters, but could have focused on telling new and interesting stories and introducing new characters instead of being character dependent. But now it is stuck in having to out do the previous film in weirdness rather than focus on telling interesting stories. And that means it will have to continue with the same cast of characters.<br/><br/>I don't expect there to be any more POTC movies after POTC3. And I don't expect POTC3 to be any better than Dead Man's Chest. Disney has made POTC into the next Matrix trilogy. Great first film, followed by two films that were more about suckering in the audience than they were about good storytelling."
"wnico","4","3","6","6 August 2006"," A pile of Caribbean rubbish!
","I must say i was, very, very, VERY disappointed with this movie. This coming from a guy rating the first as 8 out of 10. Good reviews, nice cast just more of everything this time, they said.... Unfortunately the story is a mess. Not that its hard to follow, but it takes a lot of jumps, and many times the story feels rushed, which really shouldn't be nesecery when its a 2 parter, and number 3 was already written! The acting is the same, but rushing the story and trying to fit so many angles, leaves no time to learn more about the characters, let alone feel for them in any way. Its like you just don't care when something bad happens to them. The one i found myself rooting for was the impressively made Davy Jones. Bill Nighy has, since Underworld, always burned his way through the screen with such force, that it just takes your breath away! The rest of the cast is easily forgotten though. Kiera Knightly, usually a fine actor all the way, could easily have been cut out. Even Jack Sparrow suffers from under exposure due to all the little stories they try to throw in. Will Turners meeting with his father is a typical example. There's no buildup, so no wow feeling. Sequels in trilogies are usually the strongest, empire strikes back and matrix reloaded, to name but a few, but I'm afraid this will go down in history as one of those movies you forget minutes after you've seen it. In the end you find yourself just wishing it would end, and even though its an open ending, you would be better of skipping the final episode as you just don't care.. In a word : Disappointing."
"ajmck","2","3","6","5 August 2006"," Just no effort........ very disappointing.
","I'd just like to say, before I tear apart this film, that I am a huge Pirates of the Caribbean fan andI have seen the first film a countless number of times. So for me to say this film is bad is really saying something about it. Also I haven't got time to go into all of the bad points here but these are just a few of the main ones.<br/><br/>This film has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen, I was glad when it came to the unexpected and ebrupt end that it does (halfway through a conversation almost!). This film seems as though no effort has gone into it and that the developers have just relied on the success of the first film to trick people into parting with their money to see a film that is in all fairness, rubbish. The acting is on the whole awful with even Johnny Depp failing to delight, he overplays his success in the last film to such an extext that it becomes silly. None of the actors even look like they want to be in the film and that it certainly portrayed in the quality of the film. The pirates of Davey Joneses ship just look like men in fish suits, nothing like the quality of the skeletons in the first film. <br/><br/>Most of the time you cannot hear what the actors are saying and a lot of the (unfunny) jokes made by Depp are lost on the audience simply because he mumbles them. Another thing that let the film down was the camera work. The spinning wheel scene for example(apart from being over the top, unfunny and silly) was awful the camera was so close to the actors that you couldn't really see what was going on, not that you would want to anyway. <br/><br/>The scene when the crew are searching for Jack Sparrow is another disaster, it makes the film feel low budget and like a documentary with no - experience extras being interviewed.<br/><br/>There are a huge amount of just unfunny and silly scenes that do not work at all, the swinging in the balls scene with the stupid fairground music playing in the background.<br/><br/>Throughout the whole film the developers just live on the past merits of the first film bringing back almost all of the old characters and not offering the viewer anything new, even some of the scenes in the new film are exactly the same as in the old film for example the throwing in the pig pen to name just one.<br/><br/>This film is full of plot flaws, people suddenly apearing when one second ago they were being chased by angry tribes or held captive on ships and there is just no story line at all.<br/><br/>BAD POINTS (apart from the film in general)<br/><br/>The acting The effort gone into making it The story line (it's just one ship being eaten after another basically) Nothing new It's not funny The charm of the first film has vanished + many more The ending is awful It is very predictable <br/><br/>GOOD POINTS<br/><br/>Contrary to what I have already said 'the ending', I was glad for it to end! The sneaky 'extra' scene about what happened to the dog (after the credits)<br/><br/>HUGE Disappointment!"
"skaterdolphin","10","3","6","4 August 2006"," A movie filled with the right blend of action and comedy.
","This movie is personally one of my favorites. I loved the first one and I loved the second one just as much.<br/><br/>The beginning was a little slow and confusing, but picked up quickly. The movie refers to the first movie quite a bit, which I liked. The characters were perfectly cast, like in the first movie. I think that Orlando Bloom (Will Turner), Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow), and Keira Knightley (Elizabeth Swann) did an excellent job portraying the characters.<br/><br/>The ending was different than the first one. The ending was a total cliffhanger. The producers made it so that there has to be a third one, while in the first movie the ending didn't call for a sequel though I am glad that there was a second It does seem like there will a lot going on in the third movie.<br/><br/>I can't wait for the third movie to come out and I am so glad that I don't have to wait another three years to see it like the second movie. This movie is definitely one of the best and a MUST SEE!"
"kg61410","4","3","6","4 August 2006"," A very disappointing film
","A lot of people who talk down a movie start by convincing his audience that he actually likes this kind of movies, just not this one. I guess it's a trick used by the less talented writers. Anyway, I have no problem admitting I'm one of those less talented, so I'll simply write it down for you this way: I liked the original Pirates of the Caribbean and I like easy going brains off films as well. I still didn't like this one - not one bit.<br/><br/>It's a film where the whole thing is played down by a few minor things, that just ruined it for me. Maybe you see it differently, but for me any lack of suspense or surprise is usually a sign of a bad film, especially when talking about a film such as Pirates of the caribbean.<br/><br/>With lack of suspense I mean this: all the impossible and supposedly exiting scenes meant nothing to me because the heroes were such superhuman creatures that nothing really threatened them. Elisabeth Swan, the lead lady, singlehandedly cuts down.. well I don't know, would you believe fifty?... terrible monsters of the depths - the most feared creatures on earth. And she's just a high born lady, wait till you see the rest. The horrible sea monster is really no threat when Will (Orlando Bloom) takes command of the pirate ship! Harrr! Brace the main sail! Prepare the starboard guns! Argh. How the heck does he even know which way is starboard and whats a main sail, let alone a yard. I just had to laugh - why do you have to build these heroes so much, can't they just grow. Wouldn't it have been fun if Captain Jack would have stepped in front of the order yelling Will and said something like 'pardon me, but that would lead us to the reef which would lead us to sink which would lead us to die.. savvyyyyy?? now step back..' To me that just makes it so boring - anyone can do anything if they're on a just cause and you really don't need any clever plot twists or ideas to get the heroes out of trouble. All you need is Elisabeth or Will with a sword in hand and no trouble is too much. That's it. So with this there is no suspense and no surprises.<br/><br/>This goes in the same bin with Godzilla, King Arthur, Indepence Day, Day of Tomorrow and the rest with ridiculous heroes that wouldn't even need any villains because there's no doubt they'd kick theirs butts even with an unsharpened pencil and with no working limbs.<br/><br/>4/10 - Bad, but still barely viewable."

Also the fight scenes or the action scenes are pretty good and well choreographed.<br/><br/>The special effects and costumes are amazing. Making people look like the coral, or like fish was awesomely done. The craken was a little weird looking at times and a bit disappointing at times.

"runningonbrains","4","3","6","3 August 2006"," Dumb movie...
","At best, mediocre. Loved the first movie, and hoped that they wouldn't do what they ended up doing with this one: NOT RESOLVING ANYTHING! Unfortunately, Disney didn't think the grotesque amounts of money and absurd amounts of crazed followers of the Johnny Depp/Orlando Bloom combo was enough to get people to see the next installment. Instead, they had to trap us, so we have no choice but to see the next one. Don't get me wrong...its not a bad movie. The special effects are great, and the movie is funny: I laughed at several points, Johnny Depp plays his character masterfully. However, most of the movie was just inside references to the first movie which did nothing to advance the plot. The movie can not stand on its own by any stretch of the imagination, which I find a detrimental quality. After I saw the Matrix Reloaded, and played Halo 2, I swore I would never go see anything that ended in a cheap ploy to get you to see the next movie. Unfortunately, I didn't read up enough on this movie. Don't waste your time until the third one comes out. And even then, only if someone else is paying."

The special effects on Davey Jones and his crew were great, the fight scenes were remarkable. And the love triangle between jack, Elizabeth and will got a lil but more juicier in this film. The return of some of the characters in the first movie was a great surprise. It made things get a lot more interesting.<br/><br/>The ending is terrific the way they left you hanging on anticipating next years release on May 25 for the third one.

"Nine-Seven","9","3","6","3 August 2006"," Must see movie of the year.
","If you haven't seen this movie yet- i would advise you to do so. People have such differing opinions about this movie the only way to decide whether you like it or not is to actually see it. Of course being a fan of the original film i knew i had to see this movie as soon as it came out. And i did see it- and i saw it again- and again- and again. That totals four times- i don't like to re-watch bad movies so i think it's pretty easy to guess i loved this movie. I am not the only person to see it more than once, i know many people who have seen this movie repeatedly. I won't lie this movie does have many sub-plots so it may be quite confusing at first. So re-watching it helps you understand everything and possibly pick up jokes you missed before. If you loved Captain Jack in the first film you'll be glad to know he hasn't changed and Johnny Depp does an excellent performance in this movie as always. Almost every character from the first makes an appearance but there are many new characters as well which just adds to the fun. It's a little darker than the first film but still has lots of laughs- including many quotable lines. My verdict is see this move NOW!"

","Just like the first part, the second was great and had a lot of humor, action and excitement. The special effects also were fantastic. Johnny Depp is without doubt the most wonderful actor I've ever seen, and especially in the Pirates-films. I love the way he talks, walks, and looks. There were also a few unexpected moments in the film, like when Commodore Norrington appears with the heart of Davey Jones or when Captain Barbossa is back and wants to help the good ones. This film is definitely as good as the first one, maybe even better, except for the story. The story (and title) of the first one were a bit better. I think this movie will be the film of the year here in Belgium. If you haven't seen it yet, you definitely must. It's adventurous, hilarious, exciting, joyful, ... In one word : super !"
"macrths","10","3","6","2 August 2006"," Jack Sparrow does it again!
","Pirates 2 was given mixed reviews. Some (usually die hard Pirates fans like myself) loved it while others found it only ""ok"". I was among those who loved every second of it and at the end wanted more.<br/><br/>Once again Johnny Depp was brilliant as Captain Jack Sparrow. Someone commented that only Depp could pull off a role as whacky as Jack and that person is absolutely right! He has the charisma, the look, even the gait of Jack. He is absolutely hilarious, I laughed the entire time.<br/><br/>Not only was Depp's acting fantastic, Orlando Bloom proved that he will not only be known as the elf in Lord of the Rings. Keira Knightly also did a decent job, she has guts, unlike most heroines in fantasy/adventure films. And the two former crew members of Captain Barbossa were a nice touch, though not quite as funny as they were in Black Pearl, they still sneaked in a few funny one liners.<br/><br/>The effects were fantastic, but what would one expect from Jerry Bruckheimer? The story was clever too. Usually I am not a fan of sequels because they usually end up being sub par compared to the original. With Dead Man's Chest, I actually found the sequel as entertaining, if not more, than the original. The ending was quite a surprise, I don't want to spoil it on anyone who hasn't seen it yet, but let's just say a person you would least expect comes to the rescue.<br/><br/>All in all a fantastic movie and I can't wait for the third one!!

"chez_gerard","5","3","6","2 August 2006"," Is IMDb becoming less critical?
","This movie is very average. I can understand that kids and certain adults like this movie, but I expected the public of IMDb in general to be more critical! I mean, A SCORE OF 7.4 FOR THIS MOVIE? Comme on!! This leads to my disappointment. <br/><br/>First of all, the movie contributes in no sort of way to cinema. It contains nothing new. It's the typical sort of Hollywood blockbuster made to entertain millions. The characters are as cliché as can be, and no charm of Johnny Depp can convince me of the opposite. And by the way, Orlando Bloom is totally miscasted. He's too serious. And the actionscenes do not make any sense at all!! Sometimes at a really ridiculous point, like when they start dueling with three men over the precious box on the beach. There's a stupid little music on the background, like the whole scene should be funny or something. Get real please. <br/><br/>Another fascinating thing is the magic swimming ability of Will Turner!! Not only he has got pirate blood in hem, which makes him a hero off course, he can also swim faster than 200 feet long boats! No kiddin'. <br/><br/>By Maria and Joseph, how can a movie like this have a 7.4 rating?? I can only conclude that the general criticism of IMDb is dropping. A movie that entertains is great, no doubt, but that doesn't make it a good movie. I trusted IMDb in general, often the score is ""objective"". But now I don't now.I guess I am a little p+ssed off because they keep on bringing the same rubbish, and they can, because lots of people do not ask for more... Ah well"

","I have to admit when i walked into the cinema to watch this i had doubts,i never thought any sequel could match up to this film....I was thankfully proved wrong. The direction was beautiful the picture fantastic. and the acting brilliant. Once again Johnny Depp ruled the show with his great portrayal of Jack Sparrow. I hope that the third film will be as good if not better then this cos my hopes are high an all i can say is well done Gore Verbinski you nailed it All in all the best thing about this film,Though it has its spooky moments it still stays on the comedy side of things as i must say i laughed out loud many a time especially with the whole sword fight on the big wheel. Brilliant and a lot of fun to watch Jack Sparrow running to keep along with it etc. The only one thing i can moan about is the acting from Orlando Bloom and keira Knightley can be very wooden at some points but not to bad so its OK i suppose. But well done Gore Verbinski i can honestly say you are on the way to becoming a fantastic director, Even though in my opinion you were a long time ago So yes i would vote this film as film of the year so don't have any doubts to go and see it because it is well worth your money."

","The performance by Mr. Nighy was magnificent. Being buried under all that make-up (CGI?) would have stifled a lesser actor. He took the Davey Jones character and gave it life and personality. I personally had major doubts that I would spring the bucks for the DVD upon its release but I will now reconsider if for no other reason than to revel in a craftsman at work. Like Jeff Goldblum before him in The Fly remake, it will be another excellent performance in the purest word of actor that will escape the attention of the Academy Award Lords in their nomination process. With all the seafood aberrations that populated the film, he alone anchored the chaos aboard the Flying Dutchman. Well done Mr. Nighy!"
"rivertam26","4","3","6","30 July 2006"," Not even C worthy...
","Pirates 2 is a constipated, mangled,confused sequel of epic proportions. the first one was wonderful but it's an Oscar contender compared to this. I've never seen a film franchise spend time create characters and than destroy the, Everyone in this film seems to be a different person or actually many different people throughout. the story is all messy something to do with davy Jones or a cannibal island or aomething. In the end you feel like you've just survived some natural disaster despite a quirky turn from Knightley that is ruined in the last 5 mins. of the film. The acting is all pretty lame, the movie is pretty lame and stands as an example of why not to make sequels without a valid purpose. It has some moments mixed into it's three hour running time. But moments I can definitely pass on seeing again."
"Superunknovvn","6","3","6","30 July 2006"," Remember the old saying ""Less is more""?
","The second part in the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" franchise has the same advantages and flaws as the first one. The storyline is just a unnecessarily complicated and the movie can't really decide whether it wants to be suitable for kids or not. By now we've gotten used to Johnny Depp's weird performance, although I'm still not entirely convinced by it.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is full of great ideas for action sequences (even more so than part one!) and mostly the chemistry between the actors works fine. Here's the thing: THIS MOVIE IS WAY TOO LONG! It's like a neverending roller-coaster ride. Things fly through the air, people are thrown around like volley balls, ships explode, a monster Kraken unleashes hell. After two hours the headache starts and it's just too much. It's an annoying trend in Hollywood that probably started with the Matrix and the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. Also, why is it not enough to make just one sequel these days? Why do they have two come in pairs? I'm so fed up with a movie ending right in the middle of the story, so you have to wait another year until you've already forgotten about everything that happened in the previous part.<br/><br/>Well, it seems to be a clever concept commercially but I'm not so sure if this procedure won't backfire sooner or later. After all the trick is to stop when the audience still wanted to see more, not when everybody's so exhausted they just can't take any more. After all this is really the one thing that keeps ""Pirates Of The Carribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" from being more than a slightly above average summer blockbuster."
"fmilbrecht","4","3","6","27 July 2006"," What a mess!
","First off, I did not buy into the hype surrounding this movie. I liked the first one OK, but it didn't strike me as something terribly unique. Still, for a silly summer blockbuster it pretty much pushed all the right buttons and provided for a fun, if long, ride. Now there's Pirates 2 and unfortunately it not only doesn't even come close to the first one but stands right here as probably the worst ""setting a new box office record""-movie of all times. It's in fact not even a real movie but has the feel of a Bugs Bunny cartoon done in live action...only those cartoons usually last for about 5 to 10 minutes, this one drags on for almost three hours and thereby overstays its welcome for at least two hours. I'm not even bothered much by the fact that there is no real ending to this picture due to the third part, which is coming out next year. It's been less then a day since I've seen Pirates 2 and already I couldn't tell you anymore what it is about. Not that I would've been able to do so right after the end credits... That's because the only thing this movie ever does is to go ""Kaboom"" real loud. It's a shame that this flick draws in huge crowds while there are so many wonderful movies which go by completely unnoticed, yet would have been endlessly more deserving."
"robhdean","2","3","6","27 July 2006"," A dismal sequel to an enjoyable movie.
","I first had this feeling while watching 'Back to the Future 2' - of having paid to watch a sequel that is little more than a cynical set-up for the third movie to come.<br/><br/>Plotwise, there is no overall 'good idea' behind this movie, just a lot of unspectacular CGI 'spectacle'. Ironically, it was Depp's very amusing & engaging character, not CGI, which made the first movie the likable pantomime it was. In this second film his character is buried under the untidy plot & expensive but unexciting FX - Jack is a less vivid and engaging character here. It's a bit like meeting someone for the second time & realising they are not as charming, funny or quirky as first impressions had made them. Not Depp's fault: his character is servant to set-piece scenes at the cost of any coherence.<br/><br/>After all the untidy set-up, even this half-aside plot is left unresolved: you have to pay again for '3' to have any hope of that. The final nail in the coffin is the appearance, right at the end, of a character who was so conclusively disposed of in the first film that it's an affront even to pantomime-level plotting for him to re-appear.<br/><br/>It's really not too strong to say I was disgusted by this movie - it felt so thin & so cynical, so determined to show as little of it's hand as possible so as to protect the franchise."

The question: ""what the hell"" kept popping in my mind from about 15min in the movie till they finally decided that enough was enough and the movie ended Let me also say that my dear friend NBEG loved this movie, which in itself is disturbing considering the lack of substance and humor, the poor choice of special effect and the extremely lengthy side of the movieclearly some of the scene could have been cut or at least dramatically shortened<br/><br/>More to come later <br/><br/>RMED"
"Sparrowmaniac","8","3","6","26 July 2006"," Johnny Depp does it again
","He did it back in 2003, and he has done it so again. Johnny Depp comes up with another scintillating performance as Captain Jack Sparrow, as he tries to overcome his greatest fear, to undo himself of the bind of Davey Jones of the Flying Dutchman. And we are left to wonder what will happen at The World's End next year, will Jack Sparrow return with the help of the treacherous Barbossa ?? Or shall the East India Company reign supreme now that they have Davey Jones at their side.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinsky leave the movie with full of riddles and thoughts, but indeed like the previous movie, this one is also all about Jack Sparrow. Although the plot is based on Will Turner, by all necessities Jack Sparrow is the one who controls the entire speed of the movie. Johnny Depp is again mind blowing as the wily pirate. Orlando Bloom is a huge disappointment, although the script didn't actually give him much scope too. Bill Nighy is good, but I felt, he could have been better if the needs be. Keira Knightley also gives a heart warming performance as the luscious Elizabeth Swann.<br/><br/>The entire movie is full of action. Whether its a chase of two ships, or some great sword fighting, or some hilarious escapes. Gore Verbinsky sets the pace of the movie early, and gives us a great movie. But the only drawback of Dead Man's Chest is that it didn't give me the complete movie experience. Because the story remains incomplete. Unlike Black Pearl where the story became complete, Dead Man' Chest clearly gives way to a sequel. Although unlike other trilogies (Matrix, LOTR), here the second part is equally good. The camera work is good, original score by Hans Zimmer, isn't flashy but still well appropriate. Visual Effects will also score a point.<br/><br/>Overall, its a good movie, but its all Johnny Depp through and through.<br/><br/>A very well deserved 8/10 !!!"

","I went to the movie theatre not expecting more then a swashbuckling movie with a lose plot but funny moments (mostly because the first one was funny) and I felt ripped off by the end of the movie. It was boring, and had no story. I didn't expect a big plot, but the first one had character and an amount of story, this one had nothing but dull moments and funny talking. I loved the special effects, but effects are just effects, they are not a story. I understand how they wanted to make the sequel darker, that's how sequels go, but they went all out and put in Turner's father and other stuff, I don't wish to ruin for anyone reading this. But the movie does not stand comparable to the first one. This is comparable to a Matrix sequel disappointment."

","This movie is the epidempy of Hollywood! The first hour is complete rubbish! It's plot less and without reason. The second half is a befitting sequel and reasonably understandable. However, the first hour disgraces the entire film as a product as a whole simply because of the boring (over)use of Johnny Depp. People have seemingly ""found"" Johnny Depp as a new ""great"" actor. ""OH, did you know Depp modeled himself after Keith Richards?"" Oh, really? What about Hunter S. Thompson? That had nothing to do with it, right? Even still, who the hell cares...""Pirates"" can't be the same if the sequel's first hour is an hour of ridiculous pointlessness.

It sucks as a film alone!"

","YES IT DOES... this movie has the biggest opening in movie history and I have a theory as to why that is so.....<br/><br/>Besides being one of the most expensive movie ever made it is BY FAR THE MOST EXTENSIVELY MARKETED FILM OF ALL TIME, the marketing budget of this film alone is 150 million dollars......unfortunately that proves that however ordinary the movie is if you force the people to see it they will, and then say they love just because thats what everyone it saying. Also unfortunate is that, this now turning into a trend with most of the newer big budget films being strictly OK (superman recently).<br/><br/>As almost everyone did I went into this movie expecting a good time and nothing more, but this movie was STRICTLY OK !! Despite the fact that I lowered my expectations to factor in the fact that this is nothing but a fun movie.<br/><br/>The story is boring, humdrum AND HAS At least A DOZEN PLOT HOLES, fans of the earlier movie and the ride will point out at least a dozen more.<br/><br/>The Story is completely unidimensional and is unable to justify the length of the movie.<br/><br/>Heres how a sequence in the movie is ....<br/><br/>""The giant creature is attacking................hmmm cool graphics, OK now what......the giant creature is attacking again............OK so now what................hell the creature just attacked again..........at least a dozen scenes have been unnecessarily added.

The only complaint was from Keira who doesn't have the flair to play a pirate/fugitive.<br/><br/>The 2 stooges were absolutely hilarious and provided some of the best comic moments of the movie.<br/><br/>Again this movie has been made to please the entire range of demographics, (this means we have bumbling Indian Pirate which is historically true also but good), but that also means that Orlando Bloom will unnecessarily be stripped ALA Salman Khan, there is adult oriented humour, A F@#$ING LOVE TRIANGLE (MAYBE QUADRANGLE), hell as usual this movie has been voted higher by women then men.<br/><br/>The special effects were absolutely mind boggling, (not any scene but the scale , nearly 1 in 2 scenes have computer generated elements in them), you cannot tell whether they are sets, or robotic costumed, or CG.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was probably the biggest disappointment with the last 15- 20 mins being very boring. Lets face it THIS IS NO EPIC and I cant why the movie-makers are trying to make one.<br/><br/>In all movie that can best be described as STRICTLY TIMEPASS, you are assured a good time BUT YOU LEAVE THE THEATER FEELING THAT YOU HAVE BEEN BULLIED IN TO SEEING IT.<br/><br/>+s great cast and acting, superb animation, 2 stooges, good humour <br/><br/>+/-s Keira Knightley <br/><br/>-s overdone and overused animation, loooooooooong, humdrum story, no real action, feeling that you have been forced to see it because of the hype.<br/><br/>total 5/10 (only because I laughed a lot but I'm torn between honesty and promoting such ordinary film-making)"
"neilskill2","7","3","6","25 July 2006"," Good Action but light on story
","I would not disagree with many of the other reviews submitted. The action is non-stop, the special effects are flawless, the acting is decent and you truly are immersed into the pirate world. However, I left this film disappointed. There is no attempt to create a single film here, this is one very long film chopped in two, with an abrupt ending that resolves nothing that has been previously set up. Most films that are written with sequels in mind still make an effort to tell a story within the overarching plot (e.g. Star Wars), this makes no such attempt. A lot of the story that is set borders on the pointless side (Why did Captain Jack need to find a picture of a key to know that he was looking for a key?) and there are certainly parts which do not cater for those who have not seen the first film (the 'cliff-hanger' will leave the uninitiated clueless). I enjoyed this film and will go to see the second but I wish more effort had been given to the script rather than the money grabbing approach of forcing people to watch the third film to resolve the second."
"barone01","7","3","6","24 July 2006"," Great fun until I saw the end-no end!
","After hearing various negative comments on this film I was ready to be disappointed. To my surprise the film was engaging all the way through. Until the ending that is, I am afraid. But before I get on to that I would like to say that this film is definitely not for very young kids, there is a lot of suggested horror in the shape of a variety of monsters and creatures in here even though it is ""not"" graphic. Is is a Walt Disney picture after all. The ending for me partially kills the film. This film has the very bad habit to think that dead people can be resurrected like some sort of Jesus but that to me is cheating the audience. I will not spoil the fun and go in any further detail but, how shall we put it, be prepared to be at least surprised by its, for me, rubbish ending. It does leave me unsure if I will bother to watch the next one. Oh and before I forget, this film does not have an ending to its story, it does require you wait a year and watch the next one. But having said that it was very entertaining and I think you should watch it if you loved the first."
"mcdgames","6","3","6","24 July 2006"," Comic Book Entry
","The first movie was reserved with it's frolicking about with pirates AND the supernatural, it's highlights wasn't the CGI undead crewing a ghost ship but in the wonderful acting by Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly. The cast had fun making that movie - you can tell.<br/><br/>Enter PotC2: Dead Man's Chest. Oh, it's fun, with Raiders of the Lost Ark cliffhangers that include a rolling mill wheel and globular cages; its sword fights are over the edge; a huge squid pulls down ships and eats them; and some weird guy wanders around darkly with tentacles hanging off his face.<br/><br/>It actually is so garish that it loses its charm, and you are forced to ignore any attempt by the cast to put in a good performance (other than the rollicking Depp) by the sheer magnitude of ""Spiderman"" special effects. Too much. Ouch. Where's the story? Disney: ""Forget a plausible storyline, we'll dazzle the cattle by bright lights and Captain Jack Sparrow jokes."" Now I'm being harsh; it's a fun matinée movie and Disney and its constituents have done a marvelous job once again of delivering something that will keep one brainless for it's mega 2 1/2 hour carnival ride.<br/><br/>Cha-Ching!"
"freaky_dave","8","3","6","24 July 2006"," Better than expected
","My first screening of Pirates of The Caribbean Dead Man's Chest came on a very long day. I went into the movie very tired and not in the right mood. Knowing that I couldn't review a movie correctly after a tired day I went and saw Pirates again on a better day. I was glad I did. This movie was actually fun to watch, and though it is not quite as good as the first film, it is still very watchable.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp in one of the roles that will soon be one of his best) owes a blood debt to Davey Jones after Davey Jones helped him become Captain of the Black Pearl. Sparrow of course is not ready to fall into Davey Jones servitude as one of the ghastly sea creatures of the Flying Dutchmen, so he finds a way to avoid it, and this means trouble for poor Will Turner(Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley).<br/><br/>Of course both Elizabeth and Will already have their own troubles for when they allowed Jack Sparrow to escape in the first film, and their wedding is interrupted and Elizabeth put in prison. Now Will must find Sparrow and make a bargain to get his compass, which leads the way to the heart of the same Davey Jones mentioned above. If not, poor Elizabeth will face the gallows for the rest of her life. Of course Elizabeth herself has other plans, and so the story continues in the second part of what is to be a three part series.<br/><br/>The story in the second film is more confusing then the first because there are so many plot threads. That was probably why I had such a hard time seeing it the first time, however upon seeing a second screening it was much clearer. I was able to relax back and watch the entire movie without being distracted and found it to be quite an experience.<br/><br/>Just about all the actors and actresses return in the second film, and then their are some surprise appearances that nobody, well those who haven't seen it, will suspect. All the performances were pretty good once again, and Johnny Depp is as great as ever as the pirate with the very bad hygiene. He really is enjoying this character he created, and by the profits that this movie has already made, so is everybody else.<br/><br/>The special effects are top notch, and the scenery was quite enjoyable as well, but it is still not quite as good as the first film. I think it was because the first film had a feeling of mystery about it, whereas this film doesn't. The tale of Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchman just isn't as spooky as the undead crew from the Black Pearl, even though Bill Nighty gives a bravo performance as the villain just as Geoffrey Rush did in the first film."
"Antagonisten","7","3","6","24 July 2006"," As worthy a successor as i could have hoped for
","I have to admit i love the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean""-movie. I'm not that much of an adventure-fan usually, but there is just something about playfulness in movies that attracts me. When filmmakers allow themselves to play and have fun with the media as well as the subject. The first movie was genuine fun, and so of course the expectations were high for the sequel. Did it deliver? I think it did.<br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow is a character to fall in love with. Insanely weird and existing somewhere between good and bad, wrong and right, he's just the perfect. Orlando Bloom who should have the Academy award for stiffness (if such is ever presented) is also perfect as the, guess?, stiff William Turner. The first movie had captain Barbossa (the always wonderful Geoffrey Rush) and this movie has Davy Jones (the equally wonderful Bill Nighy) who is a worthy successor. So the stage is set character-wise for a repetition of the success. Don't forget story though. Of course treasure is the goal and enemies must be avoided and vanquished. In this movie though there is more at stake than just simple gold, something that doesn't destroy the fun luckily. There is sword-fighting, acrobatics, insane stunts and crazy sailing to make everyone happy. Much as in the first movie.<br/><br/>So we have the characters, we have the story, we have the action and the comedy. Is this a better movie than the first? Not in my opinion. The first movie had the advantage of being first, as well as a story that perhaps made more sense. But this is as worthy a successor as i could have hoped for. Intensely funny, exciting and without losing the comedy and tongue-in-cheek that made the first movie such a delight. Maybe just one small point, i somehow wish the third movie would have been released closer to this one considering how close it follows story-wise. But that is just a small complaint, something that will make the arrival of the third movie all the more exciting.<br/><br/>7/10"
"isabelle1955","Null","3","6","23 July 2006"," Yo Ho No.
","I just know my daughter is going to kill me if she ever reads this. Normally a young woman of impeccably British cynicism and with barely an iota of emotion, she goes completely to pieces at the sight of Johnny Depp. And Orlando Bloom. Put them both in one movie and she's positively girly. So of course she thinks Pirates of the Caribbean 2; Dead Man's Chest is quite the most wonderful thing since, well, Pirates of the Caribbean 1. And I don't. I'm only giving it 5 stars so she doesn't leave home.<br/><br/>Yes Johnny Depp is very nice to look at, (what the hell is he using on his skin? It's just beautiful..) and he is faultless and entertaining again in this his second outing as Captain Jack Sparrow. And Keira Knightly is lissome and lovely and feisty, and Orlando Bloom is, umm, Orlando Bloom. Sweet, inoffensive, very straight and loyal as Will Turner, and struggling hard not to be completely overwhelmed by Depp. The effects are awesome of course, Bill Nighy is excellent, Naomie Harris is good value, Tom Hollander does ""prissy"" so well etc etc.<br/><br/>This is an ""Oh look there's"" movie, as in ""Oh look, there's thingy, wasn't he in......er you know, that TV thing, and oh look there's what's his name.."" You get the idea? But this movie is half an hour too long, way, way too complicated and not as good as the first one, which I thoroughly enjoyed, mostly for its complete honesty. Yes, it was cheesy, but it was high class cheese. Hand-made farm organic Stilton. This is Kraft cheese-food slices. And it's bordering on the cynical, in its efforts to milk every last drop of interest out of the audience. And I'm afraid it lost my interest way before the end. Trilogies rarely work for me, although I'm sure the bankers love them. The only trilogy I've ever seen where part 3 was as good as part 1 is The Lord of the Rings. Somehow I doubt that Pirates 3 will be up to the standard of The Return of the King. Tell me, have they fired every film and story editor in Hollywood? Truly there were at least four places in the last third of the movie where I reached for my handbag thinking ""Well that must be it,"" but no, it dragged on into another scene. And another. And another. <br/><br/>More is NOT better. Sometimes less is better. This film could have lost at least 20 minutes, maybe thirty, and it would have been a far better movie for it. We would still have loved Johnny Depp, we would still have gasped at all the clever CGI stuff, we would still have put our hands in our wallets and gone to see part 3. In fact, I'm less inclined to see part 3 after sitting through 150 minutes of this one with my legs crossed. It's ironic that cinema owners love these super sized blockbusters because they fill the cash registers with money from pop corn stuffing and soda slurping kids, then the movie-going experience is ruined because every few minutes after the first hour and a half, someone gets up and clambers all over you to get to the bathroom. They should sell incontinence pants in the foyer, not sodas.<br/><br/>I'm not the first person to note that the current tendency for movies to go on and on and on and.... is just way too much. King Kong, Superman Returns, X Men 3. All way too long (although the latter was worth sitting through just to see Hugh Jackman finally take his shirt off.) Enough already!"
"purekaos21","2","3","6","22 July 2006"," Why!?
","This was not what I expected at all. I went in expecting a great movie and came out thoroughly disappointed. There were very few enjoyable parts. Kiera's acting left something to be desired in this one. I love her in many films but in this one, her skills weren't up to par. The plot seemed to jump around and also there was way to much of the sea creature attacking boats- it got old very quickly. About the only good thing in the movie was that it set up the next one quite well. The little clip after all the credits was funny, but not ""let's wait 10 minutes, through all the credits to see it"". It's too bad you had to wait that long because it really was kind of funny! Johnny Depp's performance was, as usual, very good. His acting was great and he was fun to watch throughout the entire film. He added the little bit of humor there was. Overall, I was disappointed with the film but still think it was worthwhile going. I'm anticipating the release of the next one and can't wait to view it. It wasn't the best film, but it was still OK."

I wish I had waited until it came to the dollar theater, but in the end, half of the time I was in the theater, I was sort of enjoying myself.<br/><br/>Bloom and Depp were solid if unremarkable. There was little of the flair and panache jack Sparrow had in the first movie. Knightly was gorgeous, and delivered her lines with reasonable effect, but little about her performance was memorable."
"hilroy2005","6","3","6","22 July 2006"," Alright, but not worth paying to see
","This was as far a movies these days go an alright flick. However it has received much hype as being an equal to the first film if not better than the original. Nothing could be simultaneously further from the truth or more correct. That is to say that this was definitely not as good as the first film, (which proves I'm not just some cynical critic because I thought the first film was fantastic, my date agreed and was also disappointed with the sequel). However I can see how people compare its quality to the first. They do this because the sequel recycled all the originality and funny scenes from its predecessor. This was basically the same movie with a different name and a monster added to it. Therefore to me the film was a failure. <br/><br/>The cast did deliver, Captain Jack did a marvelous job of looking drunk or off-balance or most likely like a man used to being aboard a rocking ship. His constant stumbling awkwardness was a welcome comic relief. Furthermore the monstrosities that were in this film were imaginative and very well done. Lets also not forget the action, which was not lacking. <br/><br/>Yet in the end the effects, action, and comedy were still not able to overcome the fact that this film was riding on the coatails of the first movies popularity. If you watch the film after having freshly watched the first movie you will undoubtedly notice how recycled it was. But if your just looking to turn off your mind and be entertained by something then this is a good film for you."
"gc181","6","3","6","22 July 2006"," NOT as good as the first one.
","This movie lacks most of the witty dialogue (and on the rare occasions when the dialogue is witty, its almost exactly the same as) the first one. Jack's roundabout speeches go on for too long, most of the body language that made them so funny before is missing and when subtle bits (""This doesn't lead you to your greatest desire!""""Yes it does, you're sitting on it"") are actually to be found, there's no time to appreciate them before the film cuts away to another plot angle, of which there are many.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good in most cases, but again, Jack lacks some of the attributes that made him so hilarious in the first one. The addition of Norrington seemed a bit contrived, but he proves to be a useful and well-done foil. Some of the crew have been given too much screen time (midget), and the natives seem more like bored MTV-era teenagers than bloodthirsty savages. Knightley does a good job for most of the movie, but seems locked into a confused saddened stare on occasion. Somewhat like the theatre audience who are having trouble following two separate stories that bounce around. Stellan Skarsgaard does an excellent job as Bootstrap Bill Turner, with his tired and suffering character having the perfect voice to match it. Nighy as Jones does a good job, but reminds me too much of his character from Underworld (the head twitch and the clicking sound). Bloom's acting is right up to par with the first entry, but he hasn't really got too much to say. And his main line from the trailer (""We can't leave without Jack.....All right lets go"") has been modified and loses some of its punch.<br/><br/>The fight scenes and the graphics are excellent, even if the rolling wheel went on for slightly too long and the rotating camera, although highly entertaining, made me dizzy while watching.<br/><br/>In general, this movie tried too hard to set up the story lines for the coming third movie, and left me under the impression that I'd only really seen the first half of a movie. The prime example is the last minute re-addition of Barbossa (Geofrrey Rush) to the cast.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie is entertaining and funny, and is a necessity to see before the third installment, which I'm sure will be right back up to par with the first one."
"larryvusa1","5","3","6","22 July 2006"," Did not live up to expectations...
","I have seen the first movie of this sequel many times. After watching Dead Man's chest, I wonder if it would have made any difference to have seen The Curse of the Black Pearl at all. The movie begins with Will Turner's arrest on his wedding day? Why does this movie even have to begin like that? It would have been better for the arrests to occur on another peaceful day.<br/><br/>In my opinion, some scenes in this movie seemed to struggle to have a scene come out as a children's scene or a real adult scene. What was up with the classical music when the prisoners, (Will Turner and the crew), attempted to escape from the circular chambers made of human bones by grabbing on to the nearest vine? The best part of the movie had to be the artwork, costumes, and graphics. Awesome graphics with Davy Jones and his crew. I liked the tribe and their paintings, and the tense fear they set upon the audience. Nice eyes, Jack Sparrow. The big squid monster was very nice too.<br/><br/>Acting was average, especially since much of the scenes did not need any more emotion or action then did the first movie. Orlando was Orlando, Keira was Keira, and Johnny was Johnny. I guess I cannot expect more. Why make Johnny Depp a selfish coward? He may have come back in the end, but throughout the whole movie, he was just annoying and mean to everyone. If he's going to die, supposedly, at the very end, make him nice as heck. Come on.<br/><br/>Also, where do these two guys come from, the old members of Barbossa's crew? At first, I thought they would have a greater impact. Guess not. I think they were the wrong characters to fight off Davy Jones' crew.<br/><br/>I do not like the way it ended, with much of the audience asking questions. More should have come out of that. How will the British use the heart? How will Barbossa help by coming to life? How is he alive in the first place? All in all, this movie did not live up to my expectations, especially with the same caliber actors as the first.<br/><br/>5/10 from me."
"Jack_Acid","6","3","6","21 July 2006"," Over-hyped and overdone
","*CONTAINTS SPOILERS!* While good action sequences and flawless special effects hit the mark, there's far too much fluff and predictability and qualify this as a great film. I'd dare call it a mess.<br/><br/>It suffers from all the pitfalls you fear going into a sequel...bloated budget, very little growth from the main characters, overly-complicated plot, countless unnecessary scenes of which very few carry any sort of punch, etc.<br/><br/>The biggest problem? The screenwriters clearly were writing to cram in every square inch of anything popular in the first film and force these elements to carry the whole picture....and carry it...and carry it...etc.<br/><br/>Some examples - Depp's initially amusing character comes off as very 2-dimentional and cartoon-ish, repeating literally one of 2-3 mannerisms throughout every scene. Honestly one of his less memorable performances, but it's really the fault of the script more than Depp.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley's character goes from convincing Sparrow to ""be a good man"", then when he does so, she does a complete 180 and makes out with him, ultimately to trick him so that she and the other crew members can escape free and clear of the Kraken. What? That's hardly the Elizabeth Swann we've come to know and understand. Also her death defying sword play compared to her flailing around helplessly like an 8-year old girl when ""the boys"" fight. This contrast is too stark to overlook.<br/><br/>The inclusion of Norrington is paper thin, and totally unnecessary....not even his completely unexplained connection to the ""white-wigged bad guy"" saves his role. And by the way, I refer to him as ""the white-wigged bad guy"" because I have no idea who he was, except obviously someone powerful and holds the key to Turner, Swann and Sparrow's pardon and freedom. Why he was even seeking the ""treasure"" is never made clear.<br/><br/>There was very little dramano emotional punch whatsoever.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the action sequences were well-done, especially the Kraken scenes. The special effects for the Flying Dutchman crew and Davy Jones were excellent as well (Bill Nighy's performance is commendable and on par with Geoffrey Rush.) <br/><br/>If you have a deep love for the fabled stories of the sea (Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman, the Kraken, etc.) then this is worth a watch. If you're into mindless Hollywood entertainment, this is worth a watch.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a sequel that takes everything you loved from the first film and takes it all further, don't get your hopes up. It's all about the money behind re-hash values, not substance."

I wondered if it would ever end. And, when it finally ended, I felt there was no clear climax. The storyline is week and chases too many rabbits. I impressed me more as a set up for getting people to go see Part III!<br/><br/>The computer generated effects and ""make-up"" were fun and interesting.<br/><br/>Quality of sound prevented me from hearing and understanding many of the conversations and comments. Between the heavy British and caribbean accents, crucial dialogs were confusing.<br/><br/>The initial plot layout was difficult to follow (complicated) for a ""fun"" movie. The actor's did a good job. It had an array of ""Star Wars"" type characters. <br/><br/>There were some good laugh-out-loud moments. <br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend that my friends go see it."

The comedy was reprises of the first film, barely laughable.<br/><br/>I so, SO enjoyed the first film... but this made me want to walk out of the theater. Total waste of production time, the actors time, and money to film it, all so you can say ""There's a second Pirates of the Caribbean!"" and make millions off it.<br/><br/>Fellow fans, don't deny yourself.

"Okonh0wp","5","3","6","19 July 2006"," not the best outing
","For the last year, box office analysts have been asking whether the popularity of movies was in decline, and America answered them with a resounding no by packing the movie houses in droves this past weekend and breaking a box office record. If only they had picked a better movie. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest isn't as bad as a film could possibly be considering that it's the same great characters and setting as the original but it's close. The film brings back the old gang of characters but pairs them with and far more memorable and gruesome villain in Davy Jones. The octopus-like villain is played by Bill Nighy with a lot of help from CGI. The plot centers around everyone trying to find a chest with the heart of Davy Jones but I had very little idea why. <br/><br/>To say that the film is confusing is an understatement. Put it this way: if Pirates of the Caribbean was a course, I would not pass the final exam, and even though the plot isn't necessary to enjoy the good-spirited swashbuckling fun, it certainly would have helped. When the movie isn't being dragged down by the plot, however, there are a couple of amazingly innovative action scenes that almost makes you want to forgive the confusion. One involves Johnny Depp, displaying a comic physicality that could rival Charlie Chaplain, running away from a tribe of cannibals. It is hard to understate how brilliant Depp is in these films and how much he brings to the series. The other involves a three-way swordfight and a waterwheel gone awry."
"brandoonwa","3","3","6","18 July 2006"," disappointment
","I give it a 3 only because of the production quality and good special effects. The jokes were lame, the acting was sub par compared to the first movie, the story wasn't very interesting, and there was basically no resolution to the movie. In other words, everything that made the first movie great was missing from this one. The only people who have liked it so far that I've talked to have been girls, all of which admittedly were staring dreamily at Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom. At the very most, I will be renting the 3rd movie, but probably downloading as to not encourage anymore movies of this nature.<br/><br/>The sound design was quite good as was the use of color. Johnny Depp's performance wasn't very memorable, which could be said for the whole cast, I suppose. The fact that he more or less carried the first movie made me sad that he couldn't do the same here."
"dkjy351","3","3","6","17 July 2006"," TOO Complicated!
","I was personally disappointed by this movie. I walked in the theater expecting a great/exciting movie but walked out utterly confused. I take part of the blame for this because I was not paying attention in the beginning. The ""problem"" starts in the first 5 minutes of the film. You have to pay a lot of attention to what the characters are saying, especially Jack. That's when they explain everything that's important. And if you miss it, like i did, then you will probably not understand the rest of the 2 1/2 hr. movie.<br/><br/>I didn't like how they made the movie too complicated. It was like a big whole web of mumbo jumbo. If you don't understand one part of the web, it's hard to understand another part. There were too many magical creatures and too much action. You didn't even have time to stop, take a deep breath, and relax.<br/><br/>I think the producers were being too ambitious with this movie. They were trying to make it funny, exciting, adrenaline pumping, complicated all at the same time. They could have stuck with a nice and neat plot like the first one. The first one had a great plot, it was organized, there weren't too many twists and turns, it was exciting, romantic, and funny. The 2nd one was too much of everything that it made it difficult to ""digest."" I also noticed that there were sooo many parts that they could have just not included at all. And these scenes were each about 15 minutes long.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this movie was a big mess with too many twists and turns, unlike the 1st one."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest is a movie that I was very keen on seeing. I liked the first film. I own the DVD. And, yet about two-thirds through this film I found myself yawning. I was actually bored. In the first film, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) came across as inept but clever. In this film, Sparrow's destiny seemed pre-ordained. Perhaps I didn't understand the plot. Considering how convoluted the plot was with its many characters and many goals perhaps I was baffled into boredom. I don't know. But I was yawning.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I left the movie still amused by Sparrow.

"pingapple","6","3","6","14 July 2006"," Not as good as the first one
","I was regretted not checking the IMDb before watching this movie. It was a disappointment. The only session of the movie that I like is about the black pearl crew trying to escape from the man-eating tribe. It's funny, made me laugh. The major spoiler of the movie is too much child-style sword fighting. You don't feel the tension or the danger in these fighting scenes, good for children to watch.<br/><br/>The story outline is full of non-sense. Most good movie have their own logic inside, even science fiction or comic, such as matrix, x-man and peter-pan. But this movie just carry the plot through the words and act of a witch. It is convenient and cheap to write the script for this movie. For the first private of Caribbean, it is full of interesting surprising plots.<br/><br/>The special make up or computer graphic is OK but not fantastic. The makeup is having too much plastic-mask-feel. But in the old show, the effects of the skeleton under moonlight is a real good new idea.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush and the governor acts well in the old show. In this new show, Johhny is too comical. He did not get the chance to act as a brilliant private captain who is smart, a good combination of sissy and brave. someone always can handle tough situation with easy and being good at sword fighting. And we need not to mention about the acting of those crew covered under the plastic masks, dirt, seashell, coral and etc - they don't get much chance too.<br/><br/>This should be a show for children and young teens."

","Disclaimer: The average movie watcher will probably enjoy this film, and view it as a good summer flick remembering notable moments for some time. This review focuses on a great job from cast and crew, while emphasizing the lack of story development. Stop reading now to avoid spoilers.<br/><br/>All of the people working on: art, sound, acting, stunts, effects, cinematography, lighting and any crews I may have missed did an awesome job on this film. I gave this movie a 6 star rating based on their work alone. Without them this movie has nothing. <br/><br/>This film was more of an episode than a movie: Most of the slow points in this film appeared to be filler, added to make the episode longer and less enjoyable. Dead Man's Chest relies heavily upon viewers seeing the first film, greatly limiting the impact it can create on any given audience. <br/><br/>My prediction of what went wrong: Writers Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert, came up with a wonderful story that was too long for a single movie and too short for two. Said storyline was then chopped up and extended to make two episodic films.<br/><br/>The breakdown from my perspective:<br/><br/>Visual Effect Department did a good job on main characters; however most of the secondary characters were lacking some level of color correction and individuality.<br/><br/>The story could have benefited greatly from less plot holes. There are some serious pacing problems throughout the movie causing slow points. None of the characters really accomplish anything notable for a movie of this duration. There are many wasted moments developing unimportant elements and characters.<br/><br/>But it looks great.<br/><br/>The only thing this story really accomplishes: Convinces audience to go see Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End (working title)<br/><br/>If you're a story lover, save the 8 bucks and rent this one."

","PIrates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Directed by Gore Verbinski Written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio Starring Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy, Jonathan Pryce<br/><br/>So, Captain Jack is back to grace the screen after the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl, made a surprisingly world beating blockbuster run three years back. Already dominating the box office, Pirates 2: Dead Man's Chest is a almost a lock to end up in the top three of the all time box office charts, with some already imagining it might even sink Titanic.<br/><br/>Well, to start off with, let me say that Pirates 2 is not a titanic flop in any way. If you've been afraid the last few months that this movie will end up being cast aside like The Matrix Reloaded, then rest easy, the film is good.<br/><br/>The film has improved in more ways than one. As enjoyable as The Curse of the Black Pearl was, there were many instances where due to no fault of the crew, the film visually fell short because of it's lack of size (in money and in space). The skeleton people looked as best they could, and the waters as dreadful as humanly possible (with a tinge of realization that it's a set, not a real... boat). Dead Man's Chest does away with all visual doubt. The Black Pearl in it's full glory carries a menace of its own, equalled only by The Flying Dutchman, ship of the villain Davy Jones, made out of oysters and seashells.<br/><br/>The tentacle man Davy Jones<br/><br/>So the story goes that Davy Jones wants Jack Sparrow to pay up his debt, which is (to no surprise) his soul. So the double crossing, triple crossing, quadruple crossing plot unfolds with Sparrow, Will Turner (Bloom), Elizabeth Swann, Ex-commodore Norrington, and other familiar foes. The plot twists in the film surprises well, and the film in it's own right carries substantial weight and food for thought for us viewers to chew on till the finale. It's no secret that Pirates 2 ends on a cliffhanger note, which I believe many will not enjoy. But that's life :P<br/><br/>However, the interesting storyline also is perhaps the greatest weakness of the film. The many prominent plot points are used as ""excuses"" to set up unnecessary chase, swordchopping, swashbuckling, and squimy twitching, scenes.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow exceeds expectations, if only marginally, and caused my belly to swell, thanks to all the laughter. The sideline story of the aboriginies is easily the highlight of the film because of the level of creativity, which mind you, required minimal computer graphics. The human element, that's what they would call it. Speaking of computer graphics, as great as all the sets and costumes were, and the by and large innovating animation of the seashell baddies, the giant octopus, known as the Kraken, supposedly the biggest visual highlight of the film... turned out to be quite a bore. Won't say more, other than, well, it's a giant squid la.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly, Orlando Bloom gave par performances, riding on the film's other great qualities. Davy Jones amused and delighted me with his twitches and his nostalgia, but fails to inject fear into my blood. Most of the supporting cast were supporting enough, with none rising above the tide to steer the Black Pearl into greatness.<br/><br/>I love you. You love me. Scriptwriters don't let us marry. Darn them.<br/><br/>And oh yes, Hans Zimmer didn't fare much better than his apprentice from the first film, cos the music was one of the most disappointing aspects of the film. I've always admired/defended Zimmer scores to be purposeful, highly functional, and when necessary, glorious, even if dull notes needed playing, but Pirates was only existent at best, and a nuisance most of the time.<br/><br/>All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is deserving of it's record breaking blockbuster status, and as startling as the film is visually, it fails to deliver a consistent pace and balance of adrenaline and thought. Hats of to Johnny Depp, Jack Sparrow, who has single handedly carried this film on his back, but the prominence of his contributing is leading me to wonder if his presence will burn out with the next film.<br/><br/>Then again, Chow Yun Fatt is in the next one.<br/><br/>Savvy?<br/><br/>And I've been saving this line for the last: Johnny Depp should win an Oscar for his role as Jack Sparrow. Should've won it the last time, and should win it this time.<br/><br/>Rating: B"
"seano2","7","3","6","14 July 2006"," a good sequel to the first, and solid entertainment
","Dead Mans Chest...this movie has high points and low points all of which combine to make this movie good, but not great. To start with the plot of the film was quite god, one that could be understood quite easily, so was fairly easy for the viewer to grasp therefore allowing them to have a pleasurable time. The acting was for the most part excellent, Johnny Depp is infallible as the superb Captain Jack Sparrow, and steals the show, delivering some hilarious lines, and allowing the audience to continue to love him. As always, his entrance is superb, not as good as the first, and a little predictable, but still superb. Keira Knightley does a better performance this time around in my opinion, as Elizabeth Swan, and works well off the other actors. In particular, the near final scene in which she kisses Jack, but then ties him to the ship so they can escape, is done very well, and i felt she did a good job of showing how the character felt doing that. Bill Nighy's performance as Davey Jones was also excellent, and the CGI work done on him rendered him unrecognizable. His performance was second only to Depp in my personal opinion, and did a great job as the villain for this installment of the trilogy, especially considering the excellent work Geoffary Rush did in the previous movie. The rest of the main cast were also very good in the portrayal of their characters, bar one in my opinion. Orlando Bloom, in my opinion, delivered the weakest performance of anyone in the movie, his performance was flawed the entire time, he was boring, and mostly un-emotive. I disliked him in the first, and hated him in the second, the character should be one that demands sympathy and reverence, yet he is simply annoying.<br/><br/>On to the SPECTACULAR CGI...the animation was brilliant, Davey JOnes and his soldiers were interesting to look at and were easily a focal point...the Flying Dutchman was also extremely cool looking, and most of all The Kracken...superb...the beast was horrifying, disgusting, just purely excellent. The Pirates of the Caribbean movies most certainly do not disappoint in terms of CGI.<br/><br/>Whilst all the above (along with locations, props, costumes etc) were great, this movie was painful to watch sometimes. It has completely changed in so many ways. Whilst the dark mood is still there, the movie has become Disney'd...the first bore practically no resemblance to any other Disney movie, yet this one was considerably more...friendly. Lame jokes (funny, but lame) extremely terrible sequences (jack after being roasted, the pole, the fruit) with unbelievable, even for a pirate movie, 'moves' just took away from it. The lack of violence in terms of pistols and sword fighting, always cutting away when someone was about to be murdered, no blood...it just ruined the experience. It felt so, empty, so, lacking. So whilst they had the storyline, actors, CGI etc going for them, i felt that the action was flawed in some respects, and the jokes were horrible (as in crap) For the Disney feel, i marked it down...i seem to remember in the special features of the first one, someone saying this was the modern pirate flick, and didn't really look or feel like a Disney movie. Unfortunately, this one did, and that ruined it for myself, and some more mature or serious adults. It was effectively turned into just a family movie, whereas before many people could enjoy it.<br/><br/>However, the final shock at the end was brilliant, no-one in the cinema had any idea that Barbossa would be back, and the gasping from the audience in the packed theater said it all. (unfortunately for myself, a friend told me previously...which really sucks...)<br/><br/>Whilst i'd like to conclude this, there's two more things i'd like to add. After walking out, i overheard someone comment that for someone who hadn't seen the first movie in a while, it may be hard to remember the characters, as many from the first made a re-appearance. After thinking on this, i thought the gentleman was correct to some degree, and whilst watching it i had to inform my girlfriend of some of the events from the first movie involving specific characters, and she was an avid fan of the first. Also, as another friend said, it is essentially a prequel...whilst most movies in trilogies have a small set up to the next, this entire movie in hindsight appeared to set up the next...introduce all the bad guys, good guys, storyline, so we can go straight into the next one. That in itself in some ways takes away from the movie, seeing as how it wasn't really self-contained to a degree...just there to bridge the gap. I believe its a fair bet that the next movie will start directly after this one ended...so two and three could essentially be considered a single (but very very long) movie. That may sound stupid, or misguided, but thats what i personally have to say. To summarize, see the film as it's a good sequel to the first, and solid entertainment, even though it is very Disney'd up."

","I always think a sequel is going to be a disappointment especially if you loved the first film, Shrek for example, so it was with some trepidation that I went along to see this film. I need not have worried, the story was as good as the first if not better, some real laugh out loud moments. The special effects were also very good, as was the make up, Bill Nighy actually looked like himself, which is quite something. Like Nighy's character Davy Jones the crew of the flying Dutchman are all turning into sea creatures, very very well done.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Tom Hollander is suitably nasty, the aforementioned Nighy is superb. Mackenzie Crook and Lee Arenberg reprise their double act and are on top form. Keira Knightley is fine, as is Jack Davenport. Once again though this film belongs to Johnny Depp, he is just fantastic I loved the way he ran away from the cannibals. The acting is tongue in cheek and it works because of that. So all in all a worthy follow up. It doesn't quite have the impact of the first film because you know how Jonny Depp is going to be as Jack Sparrow, but that is not a complaint because he's so funny."

We really don't know if Elizabeth is with William Turner or not. She seemed really really sad that Jack jumped in and died, supposedly. Davey Jones is really a great villain for this deep sea type movie. This is really a launching pad for action Disney Movies. This is more adult than your usually Toy Story movie.

","This weekend I had the pleasure of seeing the next installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The first Pirates of the Caribbean movie is one of my favorites, so I have been eagerly anticipating what Disney and Bruckheimer would cook up with this franchise. When news came in that the movie may be so-so I was worried, however went into the packed theater with an open mind. While thoroughly entertaining, witty and enjoyable, the movie is very long, filled with filler fluff, and probably could have been cut down and combined with the third movie and made into one better film.<br/><br/>The plot is hard to describe in a few sentences, but basically Captain Jack Sparrow is back, and his life is in debt to the legendary Davey Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchmen who are supernatural creatures who do underwater dirty work and are out for blood. Facing possible eternal damnation, Jack must save himself by calling on Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, who have an obligation to come to Jack's aid. Unfortunately, their involvement causes them to miss their wedding day, and sends them into the high seas for danger and adventure.<br/><br/>In Dead Man's Chest we see a lot more character development of Will and especially Elizabeth as they go about their story lines and get tangled in the plot. The enrichment of their characters was a pleasant surprise for me because I wasn't expecting it. Everyone loves Jack Sparrow, but it was nice to see that the movie focused on them and wasn't only the 'Johnny Depp' show (although he pretty much steals the movie anyway, as predicted).<br/><br/>So what of the film? Extremely appealing, a loud, fun, summer 'popcorn' flick if you will, however inferior to the original in many ways. Overall very dark, with creepy characters and a LOT of plot to explain, the movie delves into the supernatural quickly and while very interesting, sometimes is too unbelievable. The good news is that it's quite funny and doesn't take itself too seriously. However, there is so much plot that I felt like I should have had a notebook to keep track of all the important elements. The overall artistic look and feel is mysterious and menacing, but could be considered scary for children or people like me :) Overall the CG was so-so and did not compare in any way to the original with had a much better villain and more interesting bad guys in general.<br/><br/>The main complaint I have with this film is that there are TONS of action sequences that are there for no reason other than to show more action and perhaps take up time. For example, the scenes involving Jack Sparrow and the natives could have completely been cut out, because they did virtually nothing for the plot. I sincerely think that this film could have wrapped itself up within one movie if unnecessary scenes had been cut; leaving only the parts that served the plot. Now there is going to be a third movie, probably with more action scenes, rather than one solid movie with a great script.<br/><br/>To wrap up, in order to enjoy the second Pirates of the Caribbean movie, the viewer must understand that the point is to have fun; therefore you must sit back, relax, and roll with it. If you are expecting an Oscar film, this ain't the place for you. If you've got that, then you will be all set for this movie. I honestly wish that Dead Man's Chest would have wrapped up much like the first one, however predictably now I can't wait to see the third one to see how the adventures conclude.<br/><br/>:::www.animationchick.com:::"
"bwiers97","4","3","6","10 July 2006"," Failed to meet my low expectations
","The first movie was a lot of fun. Overall not a great film, but an okay one made really good by the performance of Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. It was an amazing performance, deserving of an Oscar nomination, but there is really nowhere to go with the character. I knew this going into Pirates 2, so I had no expectation that it would be nearly as good as the first movie. I had hoped that this movie would be a simple fun goofy romp that would essentially be the continuing adventures of Captain Jack. Unfortunately, this movie could not achieve that simple feat.<br/><br/>The first two thirds of the movie drags on like a church sermon on stewardship. The movie spends way too much time following the adventures of Will and Elizabeth, and it seems to take forever to get Captain Jack into the story. The problem seems to be that the producers only had enough story to make one solid sequel, but of course they were greedy and decided to stretch it into a trilogy. The result is that this middle film is essentially a two and a half hour setup for the third installment. Overall there is about an hour of this movie that advances the story, the rest is just unnecessary and hokey action sequences that play to the lowest common denominator. The entire storyline involving the island with the tribe of cannibals did not advance the story at all and just served up some lowbrow humor.<br/><br/>There was another scene where Captain Jack, Will, and Commodore Norrington engaged in a three sided sword fight that I think lasted for about 100 of the 163 minutes. When you are watching this scene, you know that no one is going to get hurt, you are just waiting for it to be over so that we can go back to the story. This fight scene include the participants riding a big wooden water wheel down a hill. I can't help but picture Jerry Bruckheimer saying to Gore Verbinski ""You know what would be cool, lets have somebody ride a big wheel down a hill, that would be cool. Wait, how about if we put a bunch of people in a spherical cage and roll that down a hill. It sure is cool when people roll down hill."" There were also a couple of action packed sequences with a sea monster, when it seemed that generic pirates came out of nowhere just to die two seconds later (Bruckheimer should have this tactic trademarked, because nobody does it better). Unfortunately the sea monster could not snag the annoying parrot or any of the other supporting pirates who always seemed to poke there heads out from the debris after all the excitement has settled down.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, I probably would have been willing to pay my 6.50 to see a one hour setup to the third movie, rather than have it stretched to two and a half hours and expect to actually see a movie."
"ooshadygirloo","9","3","6","9 July 2006"," Capt. Jack and Tia is the NEW 'Brangelina'!
","It was an extraordinary film. Hilarious, for the whole family and action packed. So good (better than the first) that I'd say it'll gross the most this summer in blockbusters (I didn't see any other summer flicks in theaters BUT this) and probably all of 2006. I went to see it twice, opening morning at 12:01 AM and then took my nephew and niece AND mom to see it that following Saturday. The film's length didn't bother me as it irked me last time, for this film needed a clear explaining and the only way to do that is in 2 ½ hours.<br/><br/>The effects were ace and breathtaking. You could tell they spent a lot of time and money on it 'cause I couldn't tell when they were using CGI and/or make up on Davy Jones and his crew. The scenery is beautiful.<br/><br/>Seems as if the entire first movie was exposition for the second (and third) and rightfully so 'cause the writers knew this treasure would become a trilogy.<br/><br/>The elaborate plot will go right over a kid's head but the teenagers and adults will enjoy the movie the most, in my opinion. It answers questions (like where Jack got the compass) and a strike up more inquires (i.e. if in fact Jack is dead now, undead w/e. What scar did Jack leave on the fagot East India agent. Etc.) Obviously, Jack Sparrow was the funniest and got the best lines and physical comedy, and it was amazing. Johnny Depp needs an Oscar!<br/><br/>Norry was much more of a delight than the drone he was in the last one. He made the first one boring being a stuck-up pretentious party poop. This time around he was a pirate, more or less, but he may change again since he's going to be a privateer in the next film.<br/><br/>There were many POTCI references and one-liners put in a fresh twist (""Hide the rum.""...) I really liked that because I remember those were the most memorable lines. The DOG (from the ride) is a running gag throughout and his fate might not be what the audience thought if you stayed after the credits.....<br/><br/>Tia Dalma is the female equivalent to Capt. Jack IMO and Jack's ex-girl I reckoned. From what I hear she's going to pop up more in the 3rd film so I can't wait for that. I think fans will love her as much as i did. Naomie did a great job, her character performance is up there with Depp's portrayal IMO. The writers must have felt they needed a character who could match Jack's finesse and even steal scenes from him. Tia was all that and I hope in the third her Jack shine together. <br/><br/>Capt. Jack and Tia and a the NEW 'Brangelina'! I give it a 9.5/10. better than the first. The next one will be AWESOMENESS. Capt. Jack Sparrow rules."
"Rvrgm","10","3","6","9 July 2006"," A sequel BLESSEDLY more akin to EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, than to BACK TO THE FUTURE 2
","OK - so I was prepared for the worst movie-going experience of the summer (and maybe that's the key), but what I surprise I had! This was not only a great sequel, but I would dare say almost a great stand-alone movie.<br/><br/>I will go ahead and concede some of the negative aspects first: <br/><br/>1) The originality of the first film is gone. That is always a given with the sequel. You can never out do such a great experience as a perfect part 1.<br/><br/>2) The villain, while great at being a menace, was not fun or funny the way Geoffrey Rush was in the original.<br/><br/>3) Depp himself seemed less committed to the part.<br/><br/>4) And yes, there is that issue with the open ending.<br/><br/>But these things aside, this sequel was still loads of fun! One thing the filmmakers did not do was try to stuff this movie with humor, as often happens in sequels. Instead, if anything, this one is a little darker. The plot can be hard to follow for a long while. Essentially, Jack apparently has sold his soul to one Davy Jones, and Mr. Jones has come to collect. This sets Jack off on an attempt to find the one thing with which he can undo his bargain with the villain. Meanwhile, Will and Elizabeth have been jailed for their previous efforts in freeing Jack, and Will is offered one chance to save themselves - find Jack and bring him in. Along the way, all our favorite surviving characters from the original find their way back into the plot, and the usual twists and turns ensue.<br/><br/>For about 30 or 40 minutes I was waiting for the movie to really take me back to where the first one did. Then, somewhere near the end, I realized that I had really been enjoying myself immensely the entire time! It's that kind of movie! Just a lot of fun and excitement - nothing too deep for a summer film (unlike the over-heavy SUPERMAN RETURNS).<br/><br/>As for the ending - well, hopefully you know by now that this is really just a first half of what is still to come next year. I was wondering how the ending would feel - if fragmented like BACK TO THE FUTURE 2 or MATRIX 2, or more of a preamble to the conclusion such as EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and TWO TOWERS. I'm pleased to report that, with one of the best final reveals in a long time, the ending and the film as a whole will have you salivating for next years release! Not quite a cliff-hanger (which would be annoying) but more of a, ""Ok, we've covered all that ground, now take a breath and prepare for what comes next!"" Stop reading this and go see it! I myself plan to see it at least one more time! Congrats to the cast and crew for catching the magic again!"
"mrpd74","9","3","6","9 July 2006"," Obvious Star Wars references!
","I just saw Pirates of the Caribbean , It pretty much gave clues about the next installment in the trillogy that were obvious references to the Star Wars Trilogy Anyone who didn't catch them they aren't really fans of either! Where shall I begin? I'm sure we'll find out William Turner(Luke) and Elizabeth(leia) are really are brother and sisters...they didn't have a chance to get married nor consummate their marriage (remember what she said while she was locked up) So her attraction to Capt Jack Sparrow (Capt Han solo) isn't so far fetched. Speaking of Sparrow his only true love in life was his ship the Black Pearl ( the millennium falcon)Which we know Hans solo lost got back lost again and got back, Pretty much how Jack did. He is in Debt to Davey Jones(Jaba)which also could be represented by the Kraken. At the end our hero's vowed to search the end of the world to find him(last scene in Empire after Solo turned over to Jaba) Now as far as who is the darth vader character Is it Davey Jones?....Norrington? or is it Barbossa? Could be either..We will find out who's really who's father and who is and isn't related. Elizabeth(leia) will end up with Jack(Han solo) Will(Luke) will save his father from Davey Jones only to find out he isn't his father but maybe Barbossa is? Now any one think I'm way off?"
"Alpine123","10","3","6","9 July 2006"," This is a FANTASTIC film!
","Absolutely BRILLIANT! even better than the first PoTC, a definite MUST-SEE for adventure and action film lovers. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp gives his best performance yet, Orlando Bloom is in fine form, as is Keira Knightley, and there are some things, totally unexpected, that they bring in. And the special effects! Marvellous! If Johnny doesn't get at least one Oscar Nomination for this, there is no justice in the world. Bill Nighy is good as Davy Jones; one of the newspaper critics described him as 'half man, half sushi!'. The best film to come out in a long time, that's my opinion, and the next one promises to be just as good. Johnny Depp Forever!!!!"
"loumelou","10","3","6","9 July 2006"," An Amazing Movie
","I think this movie is amazing. It was great to see all the favourte characters back. I have been waiting for this for three years and was worried i was expecting too much. But i loved it and still it's very hard where to put Jack Sparrow. Is he the good, the bad i mean lets be honest he is a pirate. But he does seem to come out as the good guy and i have to say i love his character. Another good entrance as well. Nothing can beat the first the one but as i always knew this Pirates Of The Caribbean, dead man's Chest. Is the best film i've seen well since Piartes of the Caribbean The Curse Of The Black pearl. I just can't wait for the 3rd one and thank god i don't have to wait another three years. 10/10!!!!!"
"flmldy","9","3","6","9 July 2006"," Entertaining and Worth the Wait!
","Those who really enjoy movies will definitely not be disappointed.<br/><br/>No dull moments for those of us who can withstand following a story line for more than 30 minutes (i.e., this is not a 30-60 minute sitcom and nor should it be intended to be so). As in the ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" Jack Sparrow makes a water-logged entrance. From that moment on, you're hooked. Johnny Depp's and other cast members' performances are very much entertaining. <br/><br/>In a era where many movies are derivative, the film has several refreshing creative scenes and action sequences. The movie is enjoyable and takes the time to tell the story, which includes several subplots and twists and turns. What is great about the movie's script is that is not all ""about Jack."" The movie is ""big enough"" to encompass and develop story lines for other characters -- and that in itself is refreshing.<br/><br/>If you are a true movie fan, this movie is highly recommended. In the end, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" may be among the best palatable pirate genre films in Hollywood's making."

","This movie is very entertaining for people of all ages!!! It keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 2 hours and 40 minutes and there's a surprise ending that keeps you wanting more! If you were a big fan of the first Pirates movie, then I highly recommend that you see the sequel. Johnny Depp gives another phenomenal performance as Captain Jack Sparrow who will have you laughing throughout the entire movie with his actions and sayings. Orlando Bloom also does a superb job with his role as Will Turner and I enjoyed watching him throughout the whole movie along with Kiera Knightley who also gave a great performance. If you go see this movie, you will not be disappointed since it has everything in it that you could expect from the Pirates sequel!! From the sword fighting scenes to the humor of Captain Jack Sparrow, this movie really is amazing because it has it all! I can't wait to see the next Pirates film because I know it will be just as excellent as the first two. I give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest 10 out of 10 stars and 2 thumbs way up!!!

","As soon as I heard there was going to be a POTC 2 & 3, I was pleading that they didn't mess it up. I very much enjoyed the first film: it was light-hearted but had a compelling story and some good characters. So I was begging that, having hit this 'IP jackpot' with Black Pearl, they didn't ""do a Matrix"" to it and turn a great (standalone) first movie into a rambling tart's palace of a trilogy... So did they?<br/><br/>Well, for starters it feels like they've borrowed ideas from lots of different places. The trouble is it seems they didn't know when to stop.. There's too much going on with the story (which makes it far less captivating than the first one), bits of plot that didn't make much sense and they've rammed it full of characters like it's some sort of ""buddy movie"" 10 years later reunion, especially those re-appearing from the first movie who I didn't need or particularly want to see again..<br/><br/>Oh well, the action scenes were OK and Cap'n Jack had his moments, as you'd expect - although /he/ wasn't as funny as the first film either.<br/><br/>Disappointed, but like a moth attracted to a glimmer of hope, I'll have to check out the third one to see if they manage a swashbuckling rescue (of the series) :)"

I overheard two different groups commenting that they thought this movie should be rated R. It was the crude looks of the creatures and some of the disgusting visual effects.

"Wraith8677","8","3","6","9 July 2006"," Best movie of the summer.
","WARNING (The following info has nothing to do with the movie please skip to the next section if you wish.)<br/><br/>With everyone getting all worked up about ""Superman:Returns"", or ""X-men: 3"", this was the summer movie that I personally have been waiting anxiously for. Now lets begin at the beginning, When I saw the 1st Pirates movie trailer I was a little confused as well as most other people. ""Is Disney going to be making movie versions of all there rides?"" was a question that popped in my head first, but the burning question was, ""Is it gonna be good?"" Well, we all know the answer to that. So I won't dwell on it. So naturally there had to have been a sequel, and too my amazement there will be at least two more sequels. Dead Man's Chest, and At the Worlds End. So naturally there were rumors and excitement all around the web. <br/><br/>Now I work at Disneyland and I have seen them prepare for the world premiere. (They had to kick out almost all the workers out of the area before it began *tear) With all this buzz I figured it had to have been good. And so I went to see it.<br/><br/>The actual movie review<br/><br/>It's true, almost all movie sequels are horrible, and the ones that are good aren't better than the first one. Only a few sequels surpass the original, i won't say that DMC is better than the first because that would make most fans angry. But I will say that Dead Man's Chest is truly a great, wonderful, and entertaining movie. My blood was pumping like crazy during the fight scenes, of Will, Jack, Norrington, Davey Jones' crew, and Liz. <br/><br/>The story> The story of the movie has several plot lines, other than the one plot line in the first. You have Jack's debt to Davey Jones, you have Will and Elizabeth's romancing life, and you have the East Indian Trading Company (which by the way gives the movie a slight historical significance)Throughout the movie these plots are kept separate, and intertwined towards the end. I personally love it when a movie has more things happening at once than a single straight storyline. Some people may disagree with me but, whatever.<br/><br/>The characters> All of the original cast return in this installment, including (SPOILER ALERT) Barbossa! Seriouslly if there was no internet or rumors would you guys actually expect to see him? Maybe... whatever. Anyway, all of the characters are back (and we are also introduced to none other then ""Boot-strap"" Bill Turner)and it makes me happy to see what has become of them since the first movie. Will and Elizabeth are arrested at the beginning for helping jack, and Norrington is now a drunken dirty mess because he lost everything. Johnny Depp's character is still the same funny, and eccentric pirate we all know and love, some people say that there has been a negative difference in his character but I haven't really noticed anything. <br/><br/>The action> To the movie's credit the action is truly fierce, and exhilarating. However there wasn't really any ship to ship battles, there was a very brief one between the Black Pearl and the Flying Dutchman, but it was short lived. There is a very long battle between pretty much all the major characters which did seem to be a bit too long for a single battle. The fight between Jack, Will, and Norrington pretty much lasted throughout the entire island which is a bit unrealistic, but then a again Disney did make this. Even though Elizabeth said that Will has been teaching her how to fight she seemed a bit TOO advanced then her character should be, stabbing at people with her back turned, dual wielding swords, with her eyes closed. But other than that there wasn't a whole lot more action in the movie. But it was till fun to watch. <br/><br/>The CGI> The CGi was truly an incredible feat to do, making things look as realistic as possible however there were parts where it seemed that they ran out some money, The Krakken needed a bit more polishing at some parts, and there were also parts where it seemed that they had no choice but to do minor CGI because if it looked to real it could have turned this PG-13 to an R. <br/><br/>Which brings me to my last part, a warning really, there are parts in this movie that I believe to be WAY too graphic for the younger audience members, such as brains being exposed, eyes getting pecked out body parts, etc.<br/><br/>This is a movie that is certainly not bad, it is great, fun, humorous, and exciting. I recommend this to anyone who loves Johnny Depp, or Pirates, or just wants to have a good time. I give ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."" an 8 out of 10"
"jpates-1","6","3","6","9 July 2006"," Lack of direction
","I don't to totally knock PotC2. It was an enjoyable movie with the bits of humor that we would expect to see. Unfortunately this film felt like it lacked cohesion or direction. It honestly felt like 3 different writers were put into different rooms to type out a script. Scenery changes seemed to happen without explanation. It also felt like they were trying to tell too many stories at the same time.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER In one scene we see Jack fearing for his life with a sea monster after him, then the next scene he is being treated as a god to some aboriginal tribe. How did they get there? Why was the ship beached? Why was he thought of as a god? Why were they there in the first place? This wasn't the only time the movie felt like it jumped to a different story.<br/><br/>I am thinking there were some small scenes that were cut out to save time that helped explain this. That is the only thing I can assume.<br/><br/>I think this movie was cute and funny at times and action filled at others, but if there is anything else you would want to see, see that first."
"guerillagorilla","8","3","6","8 July 2006"," The ride's just as fun the second time around!
","Several years ago, the notion of a successful pirate movie was about as realistic as the success of some unknown character named ""Mickey Mouse"" must've been way back in the 1920's. Scripters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio must've gotten some real dumb looks from some higher-ups when they initially pitched their script. A movie based on a well-loved ""amusement park"" ride - a couple dozen years after it opened - and just as long since any pirate movie was even received all that well? <br/><br/>Well, shiver me timbers, me buckos! $600 million later, a genre was given new life! ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" showed the movie-going masses the kind of innocent, rip-roaring, swashbuckling fun that isn't easy to glean from many of the films getting passed 'round. And to boot, if one didn't know any better, he wouldn't be privy that the movie was even based on a ride at Disneyland.<br/><br/>Comes the second installation in the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" saga: ""Dead Man's Chest"". So, what now that Cap'n Jack Sparrow has regained his long-lost prize, the Black Pearl? Well, we know he can't just up and get away with making a mockery of the Royal Army, and especially not the East India Trading Company. But who else is out for a piece of Jack? And...just how many pieces of him are there to go around? <br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest"" is definitely no failure to the established summer movie formulas. Fencing, fighting, torture, monsters, chases and escapes via special effects abound. Like its predecessor in 2003, it's all put to good use with extremely witty and inventive storytelling. And it's all out on display on such lush, extravagant backgrounds and movie sets. Much like the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, effort was obviously poured into making the story so compellingly gripping, you'd almost forget that in the heat of the action, you're really still sitting in a movie theatre.<br/><br/>The most stunning success of ""Dead Man's Chest"" has to be the realization of a magnificently fantastic soundtrack, worthy of any mega epic. Great though the soundtrack of the original was, Hans Zimmer has come aboard and created a masterpiece symphony - Hornpipes to accompany us on a journey into the seedy underworld of Tortuga - a massive pipe organ played by none other than Davy Jones himself...and even a little dinner music to muse our appetites.<br/><br/>Alas though, the Chest isn't completely chock full of gold and treasure. Likely, ""Dead Man's Chest""'s most obvious pitfall is one present in many movie trilogies: The dreaded Volume II syndrome. It has no real beginning nor does it have much of an end. This tends to make the story drag just a bit since there's so much room to continue the saga's progression to the third volume. It could even be argued that the movie's 143 minute running time is at least 15 minutes too long, but once the slower pace picks right back up to full-bore, that sentiment fades. <br/><br/>And know ye this...there is a quite darker undertone in this Chest. It's not quite the glorified, happy-go-lucky nature that the little kiddies ate up in ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". Better squeeze the little ones a little tighter, 'cause dead man REALLY tell no tales...<br/><br/>It's well-known by now that Johnny Depp is quite keen to keep donning the costume and make-up of the Cap'n. And with the awe-inspiring inventiveness and the vivid imaginations of the POTC crew on display, I'd be willing to bet there are many meager souls willing to pay a few more gold coins to hop aboard the Black Pearl another time or two and set out to the open seas of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" gets 8 of 10 stars."
"kuledge","4","3","6","8 July 2006"," Wait and rent it...
","I will admit that this is certainly an entertaining movie, but the ending just leaves the film as a two and half hour suspense to massive cinematic blue balls. There is no resolution. No, it's not a cliffhanger, it's zero resolution. Nothing explained. I didn't find myself wanting to see the third, I found myself regretting that i paid money to see this in the theater when I could have waited, rented the movie with my friends or family, and only paid full ticket price for the third.<br/><br/>Beyond that, the only real gripe is a lack of any protagonist or, honestly, antagonist. All of the former lovable characters (even Jack was lovable, eh?) just backstab and betray each other every two seconds, and overall just come off as huge assholes. As for Davy Jones...he is quite possibly the lamest 'villain' in cinema history. I mean really, he can only go on land once a decade...but his crew? Of course they can. Pointless plot element anyone? All in all this movie felt like a poor attempt to stretch the franchise into three films when this could have easily had a resolved ending. Hell, look at the original...perfectly resolved ending with everyone living happily ever after, and people are still lining up the sequel. Could another completely original sequel do the same, or is this just some cheap Hollywood ploy to drag us back to the theaters.<br/><br/>Remember, Miss Cleo (or whatever that witch lady's name was) says that there's only one way to bring Jack Sparrow back...shell out another eight bucks, you stupid jackasses! Save your money, rent the damn thing."
"pf9","3","3","6","8 July 2006"," everybody is at sea in this movie
","In this movie special effects don't only run amok, they even swim amok, but they are unimaginative, copied from other movies, and frankly . boring. Boring is also Johnny Depp's performance. He obviously has been instructed to cut out the sexual ambiguity he overdid in the first installment of the Pirates series, and beyond that his acting ability seems to be on the limited side.<br/><br/>For a Caribbean movie it is .maybe appropriate if the actors seem to be at sea. Orlando Bloom certainly does. One has the feeling that they forgot to tell him who his love interest was supposed to be, and in his confusion he shared what little erotic interest he could muster for someone other than himself, between Keira Knightley, and Johnny Depp. <br/><br/>The story is of the type where every scene is lifted from some work old enough for its copyright to have expired: ""The Flying Dutchman,"" ""Captain Cook,"" the Road movies of Crosby and Hope, etc.. <br/><br/>The only good thing about this movie is the performance of Naomie Harris in the small but important role of the seer Tia Dalma. It is intense, refreshingly alive amidst the general boredom, and yes, spellbinding, a clear Oscar candidate."

","Yes! Disney finally did it! A great sequel to an already awesome movie! Depp, Bloom and Knightley are back and they're back with swords blazing. This movie surpasses the first and was much better than I ever expected it to be. I commented on the first Pirates of the Caribbean, and I said that Barbossa was my favorite villain yes? I stand corrected Davey Jones (played by Bill Nighy) takes the cake this time around! But Barbossa still is in the top, probably second. The plot is amazing, I can't wait for the third to come out. The ending is very great I think, an excellent cliff hanger that just, yes! Yes is all I can say! excellent movie 10 out of 10, great job cast and crew, I recommend to all!"
"Drake_Clawfang","10","3","6","7 July 2006"," Awesome
","Any film good enough to cause the audience at a normal theater to clap when it ends must be darn great, right? And that's what happened when I saw pirates.<br/><br/>Similar to all the other trilogies recently, Pirates 2 can't work on its own like 1 can, mostly because there are a series of cliffhangers at the end of 2 that set the stage for 3. But that's not to say it isn't an awesome film! Lots of laugh out loud moments. An intriguing plot, double crossing, and some good old-fashioned sword fights. Well, one said sword fight is a three-way duel, and takes place aboard a water-wheel rolling through the jungle with the three combatants balancing atop, and *inside* the moving wheel...okay, maybe 'old fashioned' wasn't the proper term...<br/><br/>New characters are introduced, including a big name from the infamous East India Company that branded Jack with the 'P' on his forearm, and it seems the company wants Davey Jones. Jones is not only one of the coolest CGI characters since the skeleton pirates in the first film, sporting a beard of tentacles and a frickin' awesome pipe-organ, but he commands the Flying Dutchman, as well as the Kraken, a gigantic aquatic beast that can pull entire ships to the depths of the sea. And if the EIC gets command of Jones and the Kraken, kiss Jack, and pirates everywhere, goodbye!<br/><br/>Jack himself owes Jones a debt: his soul, for it was Jones who raised the Black Pearl from the sea 13 years ago, and was promised Jack's soul once he had captained it for 13 years. Granted, he was mutinied and cast off the ship for 10 years. But in Jones' own words, that just means that Jack wasn't a very *good* captain. But Jack has a plan: Davey Jones, betrayed by his lover, cut out his heart and buried it inside the Dead Man's Chest. If Jack can find the key, and the chest, he has Jones' heart. It may not be in his body, but Jones still needs it to live, and thus there is jack's bargaining chip for his soul.<br/><br/>Overall, an incredible film. As with all sequels, some with say it isn't on par with the first, but I'm not one of them: it was better. And if you want a line to match the infamous 'but you *have* heard of me' line, here it is.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILER<br/><br/>Jack stands alone on board the Black Pearl, as the Kraken rises form the ocean to destroy the ship, roaring at Jack and spitting out his hat that it had swallowed earlier. Jack calmly picks up his hat, shakes off the mucus, slaps it on, draws his sword, and smiles.<br/><br/>""Hello beastie"" <br/><br/>And with that, Jack leaps into the Kraken's jaws, sword raised, as the monster destroys the Black Pearl. Jack is gone.<br/><br/>Until, of course, Pirates III."
"MC_Legend","8","3","6","7 July 2006"," Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Not a typical Disney Movie but definitely worth watching!
","For those who plan to watch it, my opinion is that I would watch it twice at the cinemas. For those who didn't like the first one, you would like the second one. For those who did, you would like it but maybe not as much.<br/><br/>The reason being is that POTC 2 is definitely not a typical Disney Movie. The POTC 1 was filled with humour and light-heartedness with a very sweet romance. If you liked the first one, you might not like the second one as much. POTC 2 is much more deadly, scary and a whole lot more darker. The idea of deception is played a lot in this and even the romance is a touch warped. I'm not going to write too much on the actual plot to avoid spoiling the movie.<br/><br/>But this time around, everyone had a lot of screen time and there were many surprises and twists that left you wanting more. Johnny Depp was as always a brilliant Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom became more of a handsome hero this time around and was definitely portrayed more manly, Keira Knightley was very powerful in personality. The acting by ALL the actors were good and the setting and costumes were also superb.<br/><br/>The reason I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 was because I thought the beginning was a little lacking in lustre. It wasn't that exciting at first. I also found that subtitles would have helped improve the movie since some of the dialogue in the beginning was hard to understand. You eventually got the whole story in the end as the movie was very detailed. The movie started to spin it's web around you as it moved along and it turned out to be a adreneline rushing roller coaster ride. It was definitely worth the whole 9 out of 10. The CGI was wonderful and it was a very dramatic and intense movie. You would not be bored as each minute was filled with excitement. It was action packed and the twists were unexpected. The movie kept you guessing. Worth watching.<br/><br/>P.S. Stay after the credits to have a nice laugh!"
"christevenson","10","3","6","7 July 2006"," Very well done sequel!

The lovable bumbling pirate fools were back, Barbosa had a great one-line entrance into the film that sets up the final one next summer, and the special affects for the crew of THE FLYING DUTCHMAN were superb.<br/><br/>The cast was once again top notch, with the addition of Bill Nighy and Skaarsgard as Davy Jones and Bootstrap Bill very well chosen. <br/><br/>The only slight trouble any viewer may have is that the film jumps from scene to scene rather quickly. Don't worry though, you'll be entertained the whole way through!"

","Given how much I loved Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, I was almost certain that I would love Dead Man's Chest. But NOTHING could have prepared me for the wild adventure Dead Man's Chest turned out to be. It was, for me, clearly the best movie I have ever seen and has officially pushed The Curse of the Black Pearl into second place on my list of favourite movies. The movie still has the same, warm ""Pirates"" feel about it but is packed with lots more adventure, hilarious laughs, and an all-round great movie which is DEFINITELY worth seeing. Don't be fooled by what other critics have said about it being a flop and a disappointment; I was nowhere near disappointed, if anything, it was BETTER than what I had expected. Towards the end of the movie are three major shocks, some of you will see some of them coming, but mark my words: Nobody will leave the cinema and say ""I saw all that coming"" because nobody could possibly foresee the great work that the POTC cast and crew have done - yet again. I give this movie 10/10, without the slightest doubt in my mind. Go see it. It is truly enjoyable."

I can't wait for the next movie since this one left us all hanging wondering what is going to happen. But is i had this idea of why it ended like it did. I think it was that they could not come up with three movie all with different plots so the mad the second movie into two different movies. It is kind of like X-Men three at the end it leads into the next movie. So everyone go see this. I will see you at the Movies!!!"

","A word from the wise, do not listen to the critics. It is impossible for them to sit back and enjoy this swashbuckler, they seem to thrive on dramas and romantic flicks. Are they even human? It is a Disney film, not a Ron Howard or Ridley Scott flick. Disney equals FUN. F-U-N. Please see this with your friends in family. It is, if not better than the first. I saw the first showing this morning, and it was packed. And I simply have to see it again. I hope this film makes twice as much as curse of the black pearl (over 650 million) and those who have spoke negatively of this film will have no choice but walk the plank. In short, Johnny has once again proved that only he, and he alone can play Capt. Jack. I ask the American people to please climb aboard the black pearl once more and hold on tight!"

","This is the summer blockbuster to end all summer blockbusters. After seeing this movie, I don't even remember what else I've seen this summer.<br/><br/>The sequel picks up right where the first movie ended without being contrived or predictable. I was a little worried at first, after seeing previews of Davy Jones (cursed captain of the Flying Dutchman, not the ""Monkee"") and his motley crew of mutants. I thought perhaps Disney had sailed off course and decided to make a monster movie rather than a pirate movie. But, shiver me timbers, Pirates skillfully ties in sea faring legend and myth to create a mysterious back story for Jack that leads to an exciting supernatural adventure.<br/><br/>There's a treasure-trove of amazing swordplay action--- incredible three way sword fight scene, plot twists, special effects --- one word, Kraken, a bit of romance, humor and surprises. The movie is rated PG-13, and there's definitely some intense scenes that may be too scary for younger audiences.<br/><br/>The ending ***no spoiler *** made me want to shout. Definitely, has me eagerly anticipating the sequel. This is, in my opinion, the summer's ""must see"" movie. And like the first movie, be sure to stay after the credits."
"pvtbob","10","3","6","7 July 2006"," Same old fun with greater depth. Fantastic sequel!!!
","The first film made me believe that there is a pirate in all of us. A lust for freedom, adventure and a treasure, be that of gold or not. With its dark, comical and 'blockbusterish'fun it proved that you can combine these types of films with enough depth to give purpose of character and enhance the storyline. <br/><br/>The second film has proved each again. this time they've gone deeper showing a darker and more sinister view on the pirate front. The acting is what you would expect, bloom being wooden yet seems to suit the role perfectly attuned to the style of the film. Keira also what you would expect but towards the end brings a lot more feel and versatility to her role. Depp. well come on, what do you expect? He has a lot of great moments in the film. Most of the best. Of course this franchise would be cut in half without his performance yet this film doesn't squeeze every last bit out of him by giving him the most screen time. Each character gets enough needed to give a decent pace to the storyline. Davy Jones makes and excellent bad guy showing no mercy. The plot is fairly easy to follow, on par with last film but is a great setup for the 3rd.<br/><br/>The special effects/stunts are exceptional. With these sorts of films the special effects wont stand the test of time but with the comical scenes and and general characterisation they don't have a great effect. Look at star wars. It still is great fun to watch. Where as something like The latest King Kong is all about the special effects. Don't get me wrong it is a fantastic film with a lot of depth. But it will be hard to feel for the same ape in 30 years when the visuals are outdated.<br/><br/>There are lots of memorable scenes in this film, more than the first. Some will make you laugh, some will make you cry. Some may make you scared ( if you don't like slimy things ). <br/><br/>All in all this has the same wide audience attracting variety of goodness as the first. Greater sequences, greater characters, greater depth. Everything is consistent or an improvement. There are some scenes in the first film that are well crafted and cannot be compared with but as a sequel this does seem fresh, re -introducing the same old guys we love and what i consider a great ending. I cannot wait for the third. I'm hoping for even more memorable fun that lets us see other sides of certain characters. Worthy sequel, If they make the third even better....then this will be one of the greatest trilogies ever made."

No. Funnier. His ""I feel like shooting something"" was funny but not as funny as when he shot the monkey in front of that weird woman. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly are just as good as they were in the first film, Bill Nighy was wonderfully evil and Geffrey Rush, although he only had one line was very good.<br/><br/>The story was better than the first but the first 15-20 minutes were somewhat slow. Although I did laugh a lot.<br/><br/>Overall- better story, funnier lines, not as much violence (but when there is violence, it is quite intense), but still, the first one is better but Dead Man's Chest is a must buy on DVD and it might stick in my mind for quite a while."

"stargunner","6","3","6","7 July 2006"," A drawn out mess laced with charm and effects
","The much anticipated sequel to Pirates of the Caribbean is finally here, and it's clear that the cast hasn't changed their gameplan. Johnny Depp is still swaggering about, stealing the show with his swashbuckling charm, while Bloom and Knightley keep making their way into Jack Sparrow's plans to repay the debt he owes to Davy Jones.<br/><br/>The film runs over two hours, and some things probably could have been cut out, especially for an audience that is used to films under the 120 minute mark. But Pirates has many of twists and surprises for the audience, many of which are reminiscent of the first film. Those who are familiar with the first will notice many references in the first to crack a smile or make a point. Which isn't bad, but it's a little overdone.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with the CG in this film, Davy Jones and his crew were always a joy to watch, and the mystical sea creature, the Cracken, was extremely well done. Environments and props were crafted to perfection, and the film draws you in very well in this department. I don't think they could have had a more convincing atmosphere for Dead Man's Chest. But it doesn't make up for the film as whole, which has some issues.<br/><br/>Overall the movie looks like a perfect specimen from a far glance, but it has a serious gimp. There are a ton of plot holes, inconsistencies and it's incredibly absurd considering how many characters make returns and how much Dead Man's Chest has to lean on its predecessor to keep itself from stumbling over itself. Some of the magic from the first film is there, but the only thing that has improved are the CG pirates and the sometimes almost mystical environments. The third installment will have a lot of explaining to do thanks to Dead Man's Chest, and I don't know how they are going to keep it under three hours without it making any sense and still have it be as wildly entertaining as the first.<br/><br/>Overall it's an enjoyable experience, with laughs here and there, but in the end you're going to be saying out loud, ""what?"" Let's just hope that the final installment can patch up the holes and make this trilogy a solid, consistent winner, and make Dead Man's Chest a little more understandable. Perhaps then it will lose its gimp. But for now, I'll have to say the highlight of the film was Davy Jones blasting away at his organ. 6/10"
"eunisaur","6","3","6","7 July 2006"," A Little Lacking
","I was anticipating this movie very much, since I am such a fan of the first in its entirety.<br/><br/>The movie started out well with the rain pouring down and the camera zooming in on poor, desolate Elizabeth (Knightley.) But as the movie progressed, things got weirder and little confusing, to say the least. Don't get me wrong, the acting was great (yet again by the Depp, Bloom, Knightley, Davenport and many of the others). The visuals were absolutely stunning. The dialogue fully embodied each character.<br/><br/>The tipping point, however, was the story direction and the plot. So many times during the movie, I thought, ""What is going on?"" The movie is meant to prepare you for an upcoming sequel, but it does not seem to that all too well. The plot was simply lacking something extra...<br/><br/>Well, I still can't wait for the next movie, considering the end of this one. But this one was... just not up to par as the first, let's say."
"laireowen","6","3","6","7 July 2006"," Expect little and you will receive
","Those who expected little from this second installment of Pirates will be. Completely justified.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest suffers from sequel-syndrome, with an extraordinarily convoluted plot, and jokes that seem to scream (in an increasingly hysterical voice) ""Remember the first one? Remember how funny it was?!?!""<br/><br/>Not to say that the movie in itself was all bad. Certainly it meets the requirements of a fun summer blockbuster, but after the overwhelming success of Black Pearl, this seems depressingly inadequate. With three years between the first and second movie, all the good jokes were already feeling hackneyed enough without being dusted off and reused. One could only moan ""not another rum joke Please not another rum joke."" <br/><br/>Most viewers, of course, will go simply to see Johnny Depp  but it seems Gore Verbinski decided this was not enough reason to shift focus from the overly-dramatic Will Turner onto Jack Sparrow. Jack appears to have (shockingly) gotten even less screen time than in the first film  and what he does get is, for the most part, poorly written. In the scenes where he was given new material to work with  new jokes and character development  Johnny Depp is absolutely extraordinary, but these scenes were too few and far between to save the film.<br/><br/>In true sequel-style, the ending will, indeed, leave you cheering and waiting expectantly for the last installment, but this fabulous last 30 min. doesn't really justify 2 hours of drudgery. There is much potential here, but to capitalize on it the film would have had to try harder to stand on its own - not relying so heavily on Curse of the Black Pearl  a true sequel instead of a half-hearted clone."
"lady_lara7","9","3","6","6 July 2006"," Excellent film - just not as good as the first one!
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! It was great to see some good old fashioned adventure and pirate story! The plot was good, although a little confusing and I think I would have to watch it again to fully appreciate it! The idea was similar to the 1st film - a curse that had to be broken and double crossings, bluffing and general confusion!! However, in this case, there was no happy ending and the story was left far from complete obviously laying the way for the next film.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was superb in maintaining his 'Keith Richards-style' and taking centre stage! He was hilarious to watch and by far the best actor in the film.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom's character remained a little under developed and lacked backbone while Keira Knightly went slightly 'over the top' in places - particularly with the unnecessary part she played when Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and the Commodore were in a three man duel.<br/><br/>The three man duel itself was spectacular (only spoiled slightly by Elizabeth's excessive shouting which was not at all natural and obviously done so she could have her back turned for a key part). As usual the special effects were brilliant and the fighting scenes clever and entertaining although they did go on for a bit long! Particularly when the sea monster attacked for the 4th or 5th time! Overall, the film was brilliant! Although not as good as the first one, it was still better than many other films and definitely worth seeing! I don't really like films when the ending it TOO incomplete, as you feel the whole film has led to nowhere and therefore I am much looking forward to the third instalment. I think Disney have lived up to their reputation and I would recommend everyone to see this film."

With Johnny Depp continuing his Keith Richards-style buccaneer Jack Sparrow, Orlando Bloom resurrecting Will Turner, and Keira Knightley resurrecting Elizabeth Swann, how can you go wrong (especially since this sequel is grittier than the original)? Obviously, there's plenty of swashbuckling and CGI, but it's Depp's characterizations that carry the movie. Whether it's battles with Davy Jones and his crew, or an unpleasant encounter with the Kraken, this movie has something for everyone.

","Oh, goodness. I don't even think it's ""spoiling the movie"" to say that this movie serves the sole purpose of telling the audiences there's going to be a third movie. Heck, only the news that a second movie has been released already tells us that. The big thing about Hollywood now are the trilogies, anyway. A movie's success guarantees not a sequel, but the whole trilogy. And this pathetic excuse for a movie is essentially, like a person in another Internet forum said, a 150 minute long trailer for the next movie. Two and a half hours of wannabe-eccentric Jack Sparrow crossed over with incredibly awful Warner Brothers cartoon slapstick humour crossed over with ""gross out"" sea monsters crossed over with more people dying than in the entire ""Titanic"". And did I mention it's two and a half hours long? It felt like at least five hours, in the theatre.<br/><br/>I admit, I didn't see the first one, but at least now I'm well warned not to watch the first one. And by golly will I never want to watch the third one, not even if they paid me to - I don't sell my dignity that easily. As far as special effects showcases go, I'd rather watch ""The Day After Tomorrow"" instead, which is a much worse but actually (even if unintentionally) FUNNY movie. This movie isn't funny, even though it tried to be. It's just idiotic, and TWO AND A HALF HOURS LONG. They could have wrapped up the entire thing in 90 minutes, or so. Were they trying to do something ""epic"" with it or what? The Backyardigans, in the fabulous episode ""Pirate Treasure"", already sang about what you do with a scurvy pirate: ""Make them walk the plank!"". I just hope that can apply to scurvy movie producers, too. If not possible, I just wish someone would slap that Jerry Bruckheimer in the forehead for me, or throw all his bags of money in his head."

","As much as I enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance as Capt. Jack Sparrow, the action, and the visual effects, the plot and story behind the second installment of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" makes the movie confusing and detracts from what we're watching unfold on screen. While the light tone and gentle gabs at the genre remain from the first movie, as well as the slightly intoxicated character of Jack Sparrow who is as hilarious as ever, character development is lacking. Elizabeth Swann is simply an annoying heroine who loses the edgy graciousness she had in the first movie, while Orlando Bloom just doesn't convey the youthful excitement from the previous film. Plus, the scene where Will is reunited with his father is just silly. Add in a two dimensional evil villain who just cares about money and you have at least three blah performances who revolve around Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. The movie is entertaining, but far too much is going on for us to enjoy Johnny Depp and the special effects."
"hgupta01","2","4","10","28 July 2006"," Awful film
","I saw this film over the weekend and I think it ranks up there with the worst sequel movies of all time. This is a poorly written, disjointed, unimaginative piece of movie making that should have gone straight to video. I'm quite shocked that this movie is doing well at the box office...and with all the good reviews at IMDb...must be a bunch of studio hacks voting over and over. <br/><br/>Did Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley, and Orlando Bloom actually read the script and say ""Now that's a great film""? The dialogue is not very funny. The acting is nothing new that we haven't seen in the first movie (which I really enjoyed by the way). Depp does a good job as Capt. Jack Sparrow...but there is no charm or depth to anything in this movie.<br/><br/>I can't write any movie spoilers because there are about 4 different plots circulating in this movie all of which make little logical sense and are jumbled together. You could take a dozen scenes, mix them all up and you'd still get the same terrible movie. The only notable good point was the CGI special effects that were done quite well. Overall this movie gets a D+ in my book."

","I did hear that Pirates was going to be made into a sort of Lord of the Rings trilogy, so I am looking forward to the conclusion. To be honest, before I wasn't even really thinking too much about seeing the second Pirates. Not that I didn't enjoy the first one, Pirates: The Curse of the Black Pearl was a fantastic film. Just I thought that Jerry was probably going to take full advantage of it and just want to make some money off of these movies.<br/><br/>While some jokes are recycled, the movie is still so great and breath taking. The special effects alone are incredible and my mom and I were just raving about them to other people who haven't seen the film yet. Johnny once again has stolen the show with his incredible wit, sense of humor, and quirkiness as the unforgettable James Sparrow. Orlando added the drama and heartbreak to the story, you can't help but feel for him when he finds his long lost father who is now cursed to a lifetime of slavery. Kiera as Elizabeth though, ticked me off a bit. Despite knowing this is a fictional story, her character is a lady of stature and would never know in a million years how to sword fight.<br/><br/>Still, while there are some little tiny flaws, you quickly get past them. Pirates of the Caribbena: Dead Man's Chest is one of the most highly anticipated and best movies of the year! I would highly recommend this for a great flick to catch! <br/><br/>9/10"
"carson08","5","4","10","7 July 2006"," What happened to plot?
","I think this movie should be accepted for what it is, a fantasy that takes place at sea. Like the first movie, this one also carries large holes in the plot. Instead of explaining questions left unanswered by the first movie, this POTC jumps into a plot just as twisted. It would have been nice to get more background in this second film, so the characters could have been a bit more developed. Despite the major flaws, I have to say that Johnny Depp really carries the film well in his performance of Jack Sparrow. I do not believe this film can be put into the category of ""pirate movie"". It relies too much on the special effects when more attention should be paid to story development."

","Well, I am probably going to be made to walk the plank for saying this, but I saw this movie on the first day of its US release and after waiting anxiously over a year for it to come out, I was disappointed. Without spoiling it for those who haven't seen it, I can only compare it to the original 'Pirates of the Caribbean' which I felt developed and used the characters much better than the sequel. I was utterly disappointed at how the plot unfolds, and the changes in the personalities of some of the leading characters. And I was really let down at the ending, for reasons some of you will understand when you see this movie.<br/><br/>Maybe I was just expecting too much. Maybe it was ""fresher"" the first time out. Maybe there was an obvious point to this movie, which will be better known in 'Pirates 3' (At World's End) due out next year. I don't know, but overall I just sat there at the end of the movie going ""What the heck??"" I might just go back and see it again in a few days, maybe it will be better the second time around; but I am not getting my hopes up. 'Pirates 2' falls short of the original, not in the CGI (Davy Jones' crew equals the ""dead"" crew of Captain Barbossa in the first movie) but unlike the Indiana Jones trilogy, the sequel did not meet or exceed the original.

","I have never felt so stupid as after watching Pirates of the Caribbean 2. I know that a complex plot wouldn't do good for the franchise, but the sheer ""duh"" that resonated through the collective mind of the audience was enough to send me over the edge. The studio seemed to presume the core target audience was composed of retarded hillbillies, so they decided to make the movie ""accesible"" (read: brain-dead). There was some nonsense plot about pirate ghosts ( a refreshing change to the earlier pirate fags) that was more transparent than the Invisible Man. The original movies swashbuckling and Depp's performance have been dumbed down and raped to slobbering fetus covered in excrement and baby innards. No one in their right mind would have let this overflowing bucket of feces out of the studio. If you have any sense of decency, skip this one."

","I can see why the critics gave it two stars, because the script hardly sticks to one story and there is a lot to take in, but it's still fun, from the same director Gore Verbinski (Mousehunt, The Ring). Basically Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) were to be married before Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce) and other witnesses, but were suddenly arrested for the crime of letting a pirate escape, Jack Sparrow (Golden Globe nominated Johnny Depp). They will be released if they bring Sparrow back to land to be arrested, and for some reason, his ""broken"" compass. Jack meanwhile, suggests, when they find each other, to surrender himself and the compass, if he helps him find a key to a special chest. This Dead Man's Chest contains the priceless human heart of the vicious sea pirate, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), he has the memory of a dead wife. Anyway, basically the whole story is based on finding the key, chest and heart. The island of cannibals is filled with the best moments. Also starring Jack Davenport as Norrington, The Office's Mackenzie Crook as Ragetti, Lee Arenberg as Pintel, Kevin McNally as Gibbs, David Bailie as Cotton, Stellan Skarsgård as Bootstrap Bill, Tom Hollander as Cutler Beckett, 28 Days Later's Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma, Martin Klebba as Marty, Alex Norton as Captain Bellamy and an unexpected climax with Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa, we thought he was dead, so I will definitely see the next one! It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction, Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Costume Design, Best Make Up & Hair, Best Production Design and Best Sound. Worth watching!"

","Oh God this is one great movie, whoa what a cliffhanger. there's gotta be a 3rd one, and i hope there is. this one was definitely up to the standards of the first one. One of the best movies of the summer, if not the best. had a good mix of humor with drama. few jumpy parts which rounded out the movie perfectly. Johnny has done it again, another remarkable performance as Cpt. Jack. One things for sure, hes made Jack one of the most memorable movie characters of all time. ""Why's The Rum Always Gone??"" ""Ohhhhh Thats Why"" haha loved that line. This one is highly recommended to everyone, might be a little to scary for the younger audiences. but the more mature audience will adore it. Two Thunbs up from me."

","I loved this movie from the word go.Right when Jack shot himself out of the coffin I was laughing.Depp put in another sparkling performance as the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow and the rest says it all.<br/><br/>The visuals were stunning and at no point you could say ""that was fake"" or ""poorly done"" everything was done so well.The acting from Knightly and Bloom was to me good unlike most critics said.The supporting acts from others was also very good.<br/><br/>As for the plot-I liked it a lot.Of course you had to see the first movie just to be sure.The whole story about Davy Jones and his sea ghouls is great.The story had a lot of twists and the sinking of the black pearl which was a surprise and of course a cliffhanger ending which makes you feel a little bit annoyed by the fact that you have to wait a whole year for ""at worlds end"".Which I hope is'nt a let down.<br/><br/>Back to Depps performance.This man is in need of an Oscar after missing out in Finding Neverland and The Curse Of The Black Pearl so should there be no better films this year Johnny has a chance.<br/><br/>Overall a great movie in which I shall view again and again and eventually buy the DVD."

","Like the ""Return of the Jedi"", ""Dead Man's Chest"" picks up a story in the middle of nowhere, and stays there. Criminal charges should be brought against the persons responsible for such a tremendous waste of a talented cast. This film was so confusing that I couldn't keep up with who was on whose side, and which side I should be rooting for. Even the seemingly endless and meaningless sword fights and battles added little to the sheer dull and boring segments of ""Pirates"" II. I seriously considered walking out after about an hour, but I did not want to disturb my wife, who was sound asleep next to me. Sure, Keira Knightly is easy on the eyes, and only became more beautiful as the film dragged on and she was subjected to more and more abuse, but who really has two and half hours to spare watching strange and slimy fish-man creatures run around. ""Pirates"" II seemed little more than a greed-ridden sequel, or, the worlds longest preview for ""Pirates"" III. I hope that my boycott of all future ""Pirate"" movies doesn't bankrupt the studio."

It was so boring and so very long with not good enough plot to keep me interested. I just watched it and hoped it'll be over. the story line is very bad! It's like they didn't have anything in mind what to make this movie about, and this was the very not so good idea. too long, same things just keep on happen, not recommended!

","I did like this movie...up until the last half hour or so.<br/><br/>Call me a sap, but I like movies with happy endings. I want Will to end up with Elizabeth. Will is a 'nice guy' and through the first film and the first part of the second, Elizabeth stands by her man. The ending, however, indicates that she basically now has the hots for Capt Jack, who has revealed himself so far to be a thoroughly despicable character. Sure, at the very end he does make one valiant sacrifice to head back to the ship...but in the end this does nothing for the ending. In fact, it is very atypical of him, and rather hard to believe. Will, being the nice guy and true friend (although Jack has backstabbed him repeatedly), agrees to go after Jack even knowing that Elizabeth has a thing for him, having seen them together.<br/><br/>Who knows...perhaps they will wrap it up in the third, and this will just be a mediocre chapter in the middle (think Matrix 2). I'm not the writer or the director, but part of me hopes so."

Then when Elizabeth and those two other blokes (forgot their names. The one who has the problem with his eye and the other one...) were standing with her and Will and Norrington came rolling past with Jack chasing after them! Also when Jack had the pole tied to his back with all the fruit on it, then he tried to headbutt the one Native and he ended up flipping upside down and doing somersaults across the cavern and landed on the other side...but...he fell...I mean, what is the likelihood of THAT?!?!"

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead men's Chest was an entertaining film and still the best film I've seen this summer (although that wasn't so hard...).<br/><br/>Another great Pirate Flick with awesome scenery and a FUN story, which was in line with the first one. though there was something wrong and after a few days I know what it was: Davy Jones and his crew are more comically then threatening, somehow I can't find any of them remotely scary (unlike Captain Barbossa and his crew of miscreints). the crew of Davy Jones was overdone and could have been more human... Also the opening scene wasn't as breathtaking as with the first film, it could have been the scene with Captain Jack Sparrow after that. <br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow was awesome yet again and he was great when he visited Disneyland Paris a few weeks ago (I wasn't there though), Jack did a great impression of Johnny Depp!!<br/><br/>Honestly, my expectations of this movie where so high it couldn't possibly live up to it although it came close. Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all-time favourite movies ever."

","I personally LOVED this movie! I think anyone who loves fun movies should see this and even if you don't you should see it. I do think there were some cheesy parts and at times it did drag but overall it was the most fun you will have at the theatre this summer. Johnny Depp again did an awesome job with Jack Sparrow, I loved Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. The character who surprised me the most was Elizabeth, in the first movie I thought she was a little irritating. In this film Keira Knightly portrayed a strong independent woman. Orlando Bloom was a bit stiff but he portrayed Will appropriately. Davy Jones' crew, in my opinion, were far more disturbing that Barbossa's cursed crew in the previous film. I can't wait for the next film!"

"Skip_4591","10","3","7","13 July 2006"," Fantastic Entertainment! Spectacular! The Best Film of the Summer! Better than the First!!!
","This film was incredible. Every moment is amazing and the plot and writing is just amazing and awesome.<br/><br/>It is much more intense than the first film, especially like moments when the kraken, a giant sea-squid, is attacking boats and picking up people and throwing them around and such.<br/><br/>The wonderful music by Hans Zimmer also only intensifies these scenes.<br/><br/>The movie is also filled with lots of laugh-out-loud moments, most of them provided by Jack of course! One little thing that wasn't as good as the first film was the pacing. The first thirty minutes went OK, the next hour felt slow, and maybe a little too slow. But the rest of it was incredibly quick (as opposed to the first film in the series, which was always fast).<br/><br/>Davy Jones and his crew were remarkable. The acting was great but the most spectacular thing about them was probably the CGI work. They are awe-inspiring. It's slightly too bad that they don't come out until approximately the 60-minute mark, but they really do steal every scene after that. Also, while i'm still on the topic, i'll just say it: Davy Jones is a much more evil villain than Barbossa from the first film. He is awesome, and I like the Irish accent by Bill Nighy.<br/><br/>But oh do I love the kraken. He, or she, or it perhaps, may just be my favorite character in the entire series! Every scene when it destroys ships and flips people around with its tentacles and kills people and damages everything in its path is just incredible. The music by Hans Zimmer is also just so awesome.<br/><br/>I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Also, the ending is great. It's a twist ending. And a cliffhanger. Combined.<br/><br/>Also there's a funny little bit after the credits...and don't worry! The credits were not as long as I expected, they were probably only 6 (six) minutes long at the most (probably more like 5).<br/><br/>And also that wonderful music plays during the credits...i love it.<br/><br/>I do think there could have been one more action scene in the movie, fitted in some where, but the film is near perfect as it is already.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to everybody. If you haven't seen the first, then rent it and see it now and immediately go to see this one! They're both great! Although this one exceeds the first! Immensely! And whoa did I mention that the kraken scenes were the best things ever? I loved them! I LOVED THEM!!! I give Gore Verbinski's masterpiece a 10 out of 10. This film is definitely in my top 15 films of all time.<br/><br/>I can not wait for the DVD! Or to see it again!<br/><br/>I love it.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

","What an amazing film... I have to admit I never actually got round to watching the first POC until 2 weeks ago. Shame on me. I went to the premier, and what an amazing experience to see the whole audience- ranging from young to old totally mesmerized with the film. Johnny Depp as captain jack sparrow was amazing, kiera knightly was extremely good and played the spoilt rich girl very well... but I have to say that I found Orlando a little disappointing. I can't help but feel that every film he is in he always seems to play the same characterand its getting boring. Unlike Johnny who goes from being a children's fantasy chocolate factory character to a cheating scheming pirate The graphics in the film are overwhelming- especially that of Davy Jones. The graphic artists have pulled out all the stops and believe me it blows you away! I won't tell you too much about the story line as I wouldn't want to spoil the film for you but the compass idea is amazing especially when he is in the boat and he realizes what he really wants! You will understand what I'm going on about when you watch it! Overall it is without a doubt the best film that I have seen all year and I think it will remain that way for a long time its going to take something EXTREMELY good to out do this marvelous film! Go watch it or else! Savvy!!!"

The audience walked out talking about how disappointed they were at this movie. Out of six people in our group, two had enough, and left early, and the rest of us, die-hard fans, were too stunned at how poorly the sequel was done, to move. Hopefully the third installment will improve. The movie was terribly dark and repetitive.

"Dolly_Lo","3","3","7","8 July 2006"," Pointless Sequel
","I knew this film could not possibly live up to the original, but I enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean so much I thought this one would at least hold my attention. Sadly, I wasted two hours and six dollars on this pointless excursion into the realm of idiocy.<br/><br/>In The Curse of The Black Pearl, a touch of the supernatural was cleverly and naturally woven into the plot in the form of the Aztec curse that turned the crew of the Black Pearl into living skeletons by the light of the moon. That made sense; we believed it and its presentation--after being discussed, hinted at and skeptically dismissed as impossible by some of the characters--was a shocking and creepy payoff. In the sequel however, right form the start we are supposed to accept all manner of zombies, slimy undead monsters, sea dragons...I don't remember what else because it was all forgettable. Is this Harry Potter? Have Captain Jack and Co been transported via the Hogwarts Express to a magic world? In the first film these characters scoffed at ancient curses, now they are positively overloaded with fantastic legends and no one bats an eye??? Yo-ho-ho indeed.<br/><br/>This film also regrettably suffers from the insidious disease of senselessly regurgitating dialogue that was cleverly used in the previous film. The second time around it just reeks of a desperate attempt to recapture the success of the original. I suppose the audience is expected to be delighted by the sheer familiarity of hearing the old lines. I wasn't. Silly me, I was actually expecting NEW clever lines instead of the same ones.<br/><br/>I could go on, but basically if you're the type who would enjoy watching Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom grocery shopping or filing their income taxes, you should see this film. Otherwise, don't bother. I like watching them too, but there's a limit to what I can tolerate. Dead Man's Chest goes way beyond that limit. I think it was essentially an excuse for the cast and crew to get a tan in the Caribbean and waste some money on grand effects. The only positive comment I have is that it looks as though it was fun to film. But not to watch."
"superherojunkie","5","3","7","8 July 2006"," One of the biggest downfalls EVER
","I was so excited to see Dead Man's Chest that I even ordered advance tickets to ensure I'd see it on opening night. God, do I regret that. The movie started out all right, I'll give it that. But...why did Beckett even WANT the chest?!?! For fame and fortune? The entire plot was so convoluted that the people sitting behind me were constantly whispering ""Wait, WHAT?! What the hell are they talking about?!"" And I agree. Beckett wants Jack's compass to find the chest (somehow the EITC plays into there....something about controlling the seas?), Jack wants the chest, Norrington wants the chest, Will wants the compass, Elizabeth wants the chest to get Will back, Jack wants the chest, Elizabeth, and possibly some more rum....And the entire sequence with the natives...why was that even there? It was never explained how they were marooned there or why they worshiped Jack as a god. Yes, there were some very funny lines in it, but a movie shouldn't have a half hour sequence for a few good one-liners. And the CGI...so overdone. In the first movie, you could actually match up the skeletons with the pirates, but Davy Jones's sailors didn't even look like REAL, let alone like people. And yes, I realize that hinting that they could look real is inconceivable, but the first movie at least had a degree of believability. It evoked empathy as well. The only real emotion evoked from me in this movie was a bit of sympathy for Will and his father, and even that was quite fleeting. The ending was quite cheap as well. The whole slow-motion ending, with Jack falling into the kraken's mouth with his sword drawn, determined to kill it as it devours him was very over-dramatic and overdone. And every person in that theater knew that Jack was not going to stay dead because there is indeed a third movie. And the final scene...'How far are you willing to go to bring him back?' Certainly not to the world's end, as Tia Dalma says.<br/><br/>Oh and Barbossa? He's DEAD. And should stay that way. Even though he kicked Davy Jones's ass in the villain department. How do you bring back the dead who was once undead? And who the HELL would travel to the ends of the earth to bring back Barbossa? It certainly didn't seem like he had many good friends in the first movie."

","Well, this is my first movie review, I'm going to try and get straight to the point, and try to avoid being wordy.

Maybe they should have cut one or two of the twenty needless scenes, or maybe wrote out a few of the 100 sub plotsthere was a lot to take in heretoo much for me.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp waswell Jack Sparrow in high gear. The subtle characteristics were put into overdrive. Orlando Bloom was barely there, Knightly waswell hot There were some great scenes in this movie, I laughed quite a few times, but I was never on the edge of my seat, I was quite bored. Everything the characters did seemed to take forever. This movie cannot hold a candle to the original, I was very disappointed. Superman still remains supreme as far as this year's summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Well that ends my lackluster review on a rather lackluster movie."
"iplaygames2","5","3","7","7 July 2006"," A lackluster sequel to a great movie..
","I just can't, in good faith, rate this movie higher than 5/10. Maybe it's just because it's the sequel to one of the best movies ever. Maybe it's because it uses the same type of effects as the original. More likely, it's because the plot line doesn't really ""go"" anywhere.<br/><br/>The ending reminded me of The Empire Strikes Back. You know, the 2nd movie of the original Star Wars trilogy. It picked up from the first movie and, predictably, leaves open a few cliffhangers to lead into the 3rd movie. If you don't mind this type of thing, then read no further. If, however, you are like me and enjoy an 'ending' to a movie, this one will bother you.<br/><br/>The sets are beautiful, Knightley is gorgeous, and Depp and Bloom play the hero roles to near perfection. Dialogue is strong, but some of the side characters development is lacking. I won't put spoilers in here, but there are a few notable people in this movie, and we're never quite sure what their purpose is.<br/><br/>I do recommend you go see this movie if you enjoyed the original. I plan on seeing the final piece of the trilogy next year, so I felt obligated to see this one. I suppose it will prove to be a essential piece of the puzzle, so to speak, but right now I just feel deflated and unimpressed."
"rustdyed","6","3","7","7 July 2006"," entertaining in its own right, but can't hold a candle to the original
","Dead Man's chest was, at best, an entertaining wild goose chase. Following the rules of a sequel, it is bigger, brasher, and derivative of the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, Curse of the Black Pearl. The jokes felt (and often were) recycled. Each reference deserved nothing more than a fond chuckle. To psych myself up for the new film, I watched Curse of the Black Pearl again last night, and found that my appreciate for it actually grew with each watching. I do not see this happening with the latest Pirate escapade.<br/><br/>But enough comparisons. As i said, on its own Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a satisfying summer blockbuster, with pretty faces, somewhat clever writing, and its fair share of shocks and scares. Based again on the Disney theme park ride (which I hear they're finishing revamping to capitalize on fan's love of the film's story), this one feels more like a ride. That is to say, the plot points are used simply to thrown the characters through various roller-coaster like adventures without any real consequence. No one is ever safe, but then again you never feel that anyone won't make it into the next scene. Maybe its just because I know there will be another sequel, but any genuine concern for the character's well-being or actual investment in the story is missing. <br/><br/>So yes, an enjoyable film, but missing the heart of the original. but you probably knew that already. So catch a matinée, sit back, try not to think too much, and enjoy the movie based on a ride. or don't."

","I went into this film after reading mixed reviews from the so called expert critics and let me tell you, most of them are wrong. This film is a lot of fun and very exciting throughout. Yes it does follow the star wars format for trilogy's as the x-men series did and this is dark like the empire strikes back. There are a few minor down points like the cgi isn't always up to scratch and some characters don't get enough screen time, but for me this film is all about great action set pieces and watching Johnny Depp do his thing as Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom does a much better job as Will Turner this time around, i felt he was one of weak links in the first film, i cringed as he delivered his line ""goodbye"" after finishing off a pirate. After watching a very satisfying film such as Dead Mans Chest the only bad feeling is knowing i have to wait until next year for the third instalment."

","It was always going to be a bloody good movie to knock V for Vendetta off its perch as 'Best Movie of 2006' and Pirates 2 just about does it, with another rollicking adventure full of fun, thrills and laughs.<br/><br/>The plot this time around once again centres over Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp ), who finds himself owing a blood debt to Davy Jones ( Bill Nighy ), the captain of the Flying Dutchman and guardian of the Kraken. Once again tied up in this adventures are Will and Elizabeth ( Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley respectively ) who find themselves in the shadow of the gallows unless they can acquire Sparrow's compass, to which the new Governor has his own reasons for wanting. All this adds up to 150 minutes of great cinema with a final shot to leave you breathless.<br/><br/>Once again Johnny Depp excels as Sparrow, showing the swagger and the panache that stole the show in the first movie. Knightley and Bloom play straight woman and man to this well, but Bill Nighy truly steals the show as the menacing villain of the deep in Davy Jones, giving him a truly evil feel, and the scenes with him and Depp are truly ones to behold.<br/><br/>Pirates 2 is an amazing movie that you will enter in as a adult and leave as a kid.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has me in two minds at the moment. On the one hand, it was funnier, more energetic, more dark and scary and even more fun to watch than the first. On the other hand, right now I would absolutely KILL to see the next film (and happily fork out ten times the movie ticket price), as the ending of this one leaves things rather unresolved.<br/><br/>The most amazing feat of the film is how it manages to tread over old jokes and still make them funny. Gods, human sacrifices, cannibals, slapstick, dialogue... Fortunately, we were spared translation jokes, but everything else you could possibly expect in a pirate movie was in it. There were also some fantastic jokes that felt fresh (especially during one big action sequence in the middle, the slapstick went into overdrive, and even Keira Knightley got laughs out of the audience) The acting, for the most part, was brilliant, too. Keira Knightley being the honourable exception, delivering her lines courtesy of a British accent rather than any acting effort.<br/><br/>I'll definitely buy the DVD and recommend the film to all my friends - but with the warning that it makes the wait for part 3 almost too unbearable... 9/10 - one point being deducted for the cliffhanger ending."

","""They were a rough lot indeed, as sailors mostly are: being men rooted out of all the kindly parts of life, and condemned to toss together . . . them that had sailed with the pirates and seen things it would be a shame even to speak of . . . ."" R.L Stevenson <br/><br/>Swishbuckling Johnny Depp as pirate captain Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest reprises a role that in its maiden voyage looked like a great vehicle for Depp to show his many mugging and voice talents. Now he is a caricature of himself endlessly repeating the ticks that once tocked.<br/><br/>The pirates are looking for too many treasures, gold and human, so the film ends up being a stew of concepts looking for a rest. Thank goodness for easy-to-look-at Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann, a damsel hopelessly caught between her need to save virtuous fiancé Will Turner and her passion for the reprobate Sparrow. The special effects are the same old quick cuts and malleable cosmetics, crafting a crafty Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with moving worms on his face and a kraken with tentacles worthy of Jules Verne but far more believable. Depp is the Errol Flynn of our time but with much deeper talent and narrower taste in women (Vanessa Paradis as a wife is enough for any man in a lifetime).<br/><br/>I have little else to say. The original Pirates of the Caribbean was an original and Depp a most creative Sparrow. The second time around it's more of the same, not a stretch or a necessity for an actor of Depp's considerable talent. As for Orlando Bloom, a sizable paycheck for no challenge is a bit like a pirate finding a chest of goldhe doesn't deserve it, but it still gets the girls and the audience."

","One of the nice quotes from the movie, do you fear dead... I like the way Bill(who plays Davy Jones) said it ... The movie is nice and cool , and it's a nice way to make a beginning of the third one ^^ ... I liked this movie cause of the storyline and the nice cgi of Davy Jones and his crew. If you wouldn't know better, you would say these guys are real ^^ ... Well for the movie itself, it's just so fantastic ! ... The story about the heart and the hints for the third movie are so cool ... I didn't watch it one time , but hundred times ! ... Just cause i wanted to know everything of it ...

Laughed a lot, plot was thin but you don't watch it for plot lines, you watch it for the action and the interaction between the characters. The waterwheel and beach scene is total slapstick, laughed so loud that I scared the dogs.<br/><br/>Keep an eye out for a certain rock n roller, don't blink you might miss him!!

"eagle_eye183001","8","2","4","1 September 2007"," This movie was great
","Overall I thought this was a great movie and a good way to follow up on the first. The only thing that I have to say against it is that you with all the different plots it took me a couple of times of watching it to understand what was going on (also the battle between The Black Pearl and The Flying Dutchman was a little iffy to me in how it was thought up but when you think about it, it's pirates so what do you expect). The movie actually reminded me a lot of Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back in how something happened to the hero in both movies (Han Solo got put into carbon freeze and Jack git sent to Davey Jones' Locker) as well as how the main characters were constantly pursued by Davey Jones and the East India Trading Company. One thing that I noticed the first time watching it is that you see a different side of Jack in this movie than in the first movie in that he's not the quick-witted, mad, rum-drinker but more of an urgent, sort of cowardly and sometimes ruthless individual trying to get away at all costs. To be honest the love plot between Will and Elizabeth was really getting on my nerves but the idea of Norrington coming back as a drunk was hilarious. But overall the main reason why I liked this movie was because of Davey Jones who in my opinion is the poster-villain from here on in as everything he said and did was just ruthless (I still can't get over the first line he says in the movie when he threatens the dying sailor and he's smoking a pipe as he says ""Do you fear death?"" and even worse when the other sailor declines his offer to join his crew and he signals his second-in-command to kill him)- whoever had the idea of inserting DAvey Jones in the sequel was a genius because that separated the second from the first and in effect possibly made the second into its own movie."

","There are times when you watch a movie and think, ""Stories like this are the stories that movies were made to tell."" Stories that may be a little simple, but not necessarily simplistic; stories about love and fighting and betrayal and redemption, with lots of really eye-popping visuals.<br/><br/>Stories that stick cleverly to every trope of the genre, cleverly subverting just enough to feel fresh and funny, adding comedic touches in exactly the right places and lashings of suspense and melodrama in exactly the right places.<br/><br/>Yes, there are problems with this movie. A long scene involving Jack as a cannibal king feels too long and too Jackily self-indulgent and not necessary enough to the plot. Orlando Bloom can now act his way out of a paper bag, but not much further. Keira Knightley seemed so much more winsome in the first film than she is here, and the movie should really be watched in conjunction with the third, At World's End, to get the full benefit of what story there is. And it lacks that element of surprise the first movie had.<br/><br/>Still. It's a pirate movie, full of fun and adventure and spectacle; the people making the movie are obviously having a wonderful time, and obviously want you to have a time that's just as good. It's difficult to resist falling in line with such eager wishes."

","Thank God I didn't see this garbagepiece at the theater and waste $25.00 on tickets and snacks. HA! A lot of fools wasted their money on this. 435 million box office receipts! What the hell is wrong with this country. Only a brainless fool would like this mess. I can't understand moviegoers would go see this. From the previews I knew this was going to be bad. I hated the first film, so there was no way in hell was going to see this pile of dung. So after all the chaos died out, I just rented it this weekend while many more fools were flocking to see the third film of this overrated trilogy. Everything I expected, plus more garbage. This makes the first film look pretty decent. If I saw this at the theater I would've been swearing to myself for weeks on why I wasted my money, gas, and time on such crap. Well, after renting it I don't feel the same way. Four dollars down the drain nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>The movie itself now is a complete washout. It's awful, pathetic, and just bad, very, very bad. Same plot. Looking for some stupid treasure, fighting the baddies, and once again the baddies are from the depths of the sea. Decomposed bodies that aren't the least bit scary. The whole movie consists of endless, painful comedy and very far out action sequences that aren't the least bit entertaining. I found myself laughing at two jokes and both came from the parrot. The movie's running time of 2hrs and 21 minutes, not counting the 9 minutes of end credits is a complete waste of money and time. About two hours of the movie feature scenes of running and chasing from the natives and ships being brought down by the kraken and none of it tells any part of the story. The movie also features way too much gross moments of make-up and special effects. Especially the scene that features Noami Harris. YUCK! That face with that make-up is ultimately gross. Now Harris also was in the crappy Miami Vice movie, and that film sucked badly. But compared to this it's a pretty damn good film. The whole movie consisted of endless parody from other films. Especially from The Mummy Returns, the Indiana Jones films, Captain Blood and other pirate movies. However, the movie that it was highly influenced by was 20,000 Leauges Under the Sea.<br/><br/>20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, now that's a terrific film and a classic. Great special effects, breathtaking underwater photography, and a wonderful cast featured in a action packed pirate movie. Dead Man's Chest was a remake of that film. In fact Davey Jones reminded me of a mutinied Captain Nemo with his ship and men and his organ. But Nemo had a motive and was a genius. Jones is a buffoon and an idiot, along with Jack Sparrow and the rest of the cast is this awful, soon to be forgotten piece of garbage. One of the worst films I've ever seen. You want a great pirate movie. I recommend these classics: Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk. Nobody beats Errol Flynn the king of all swashbucklers. Also take a look at: The Black Swan and of course 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. The classic one with James Mason and Kirk Douglas."

","I can't believe this movie can be liked by anyone. For starters, the story is extremely poor. Seems like the director of the movie thought that just because he is introducing out of the world creatures, he can make and twist whatever rules he wants to, no matter how unreasonable they sound.<br/><br/>A saving grace for such movies is a good and entertaining ending. Unfortunately, the ending of this movie is beyond horrible. One hardly gets a sense of closure from the ending. Everything seems to have been left for the 3rd sequel, which is not good.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie has some humor in it, but unfortunately whatever happens in the first half is almost unconnected to the main story and seems totally irrelevant once one finishes seeing the movie.<br/><br/>This sequel doesn't even come close to the first movie of this series. I wish the makers of this movie had worked a little harder to preserve the good name they'd made in the first one."

The first film stands alone, but sets up many of the characters in this new adventure.<br/><br/>The special effects are just as good and there is a new villain, Davy Jones, whose tentacles have a mind of their own. The new dead pirates on Jones' ship were cool, there was the one with the hammer head and shell head, just really cool. We don't get to see much of the Kraken until the end, but when we see it's mouth, wow! Also, Johnny Depp is once again great and the humor is back. I thought it was almost as funny as the first. And I thought the plot made sense. I don't agree with all these reviews saying it was too long, plot hard to follow.

The plot line felt very forced, and it was weak at best. I found myself checking my watch during the movie and thinking, ""Oh God! An hour to go!"" Johnny Depp's character made the last movie, not the script. In Pirates 2, the script overtook everything and Capt. Jack Sparrow's character didn't stand out nearly as much as it should have. The movie was drawn out and boring.<br/><br/>Just about everyone I talk to thought this movie was at least as good as the first. I believe that they think this because it says ""Pirates"" on it, not because it was a good movie."

","Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) owes a debt to Davie Jones (Nighy) and if he fails he will forever work for Davie Jones in the afterlife. The British are after Davie Jones' chest. What could be in it that they want? The British know it's not treasure.<br/><br/>This is a long, and tedious movie which didn't need to have been made. A shorter version could have sufficed providing the dialogues could be understood for the most part (there is a lot of mumbling in here), the chase scenes (there are too many chase scenes that go on forever) could either be cut down or shortened considerably, and something else bothered me too. Why were we subjected to almost a half hour plus of some natives trying to capture Sparrow to cook him alive to release his godly spirit? Why, woof, woof, why? <br/><br/>I have to admit all the CGI are terrific. Yes, some of the stunts are very good, some are pretty bad and some are neither good or bad as they are just there for no apparent reason But, this is what hurts most: no good lines were heard. The writing was very bland, woof, woof.<br/><br/>The acting was okay for the story such as it is. No Oscar nominees in here. The only one I wanted to see more of was Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) as she was the only human looking thing in the movie. Pretty too. Get a load of Davie Jones (Nighy). He looked like Buffalo Bill with his octopus face. As for Johnny Depp (he is a good actor) he needed more lines in this to keep my interest. It's okay to watch him act like a drunken sailor, but he needed more lines to help us understand some things. Half the movie he is on the run from something. Enough already, woof, woof.<br/><br/>And, they want to make a third installment? This is not an epic, this is a long drawn out contrived story. Oh, that's right Keith Richards needs to show up. So the only people who would have an interest in the third installment would be Keith Richards and the Rolling Stones fans. Count me out. But, you see there has to be a third installment because some people need to know what happened to Captain Jack Sparrow. I do not need to know, matey, woof, woof.<br/><br/>Too long, too many chase scenes, too much mumbling, too many dark scenes and no good lines are all this dog has to offer.

"aliceboy","8","2","4","24 September 2006"," A step in the (rope) ladder
","In this second installment in Disney's only successful ride-to-movie franchise (does anyone even remember 'Tower of Terror'?), we find the major players further along in their lives, though in similar positions. Jack Sparrow is in trouble again and at the whim of his own worst interests; Will Turner again finds himself in the position of leverage; Ms. Swann is able once more to indulge firsthand her infatuation with pirates; and the once-mighty naval man Norrington is forced to compromise his principles for his heart. Sparrow's soul, it turns out, is owed to the Lovecraftian Davy Jones. He can either turn over a pile o' souls to Jones in his own stead, or defeat Jones by retrieving Jones' heart from the infamous Locker. Meanwhile, all sorts of monstrous phantasmagoria ensues involving the creepy crew of Jones' Flying Dutchman. It's a mishmash of nautical lore, certainly, but somehow it all works...and they even manage to work in the swampy start of the original ride as well! This isn't at all a bad movie, even though Depp's performance is a little weak. I like to think he was distracted during shooting by being in mourning over the death of Hunter S. Thompson. Fortunately, we are already familiar with Capt. Jack Sparrow, so the character carries where the performance lacks. Also there to provide support are excellent actors like Bill Nighy and Stellan Skarsgård aboard the fantastic-looking Flying Dutchman. The effects are great, especially if you like monsters, though they can be overwhelming at times. I can't imagine how much this will lose going to the small-screen, where the huge cast of truly amazing-looking creatures will just turn into a dark mush for the eyes. Be forewarned, though, for its fine points (even beyond a strong supporting cast and slick effects, there's a fun story and up-the-ante action scenes), this movie should be viewed with the knowledge that it is REALLY the second part of a trilogy. It was alarming to come within minutes of the film's end and realise suddenly that there was no resolution in sight...until movie number three! So, as long as the viewer can enter the theatre forearmed with that information, this ride's an enjoyable one."

","When you go to a Theme Park you feel excited to go on any attraction but you will always have the greatest fun in the biggest one: the roller-coaster. It's the STAR of the park. And Pirates of the Caribbean. Dead man's chest, is the main attraction of the box office.<br/><br/>The strong point of this movie is its entertaining flavor. You should watch this film without any prejudice against blockbusters: Pirates is an attraction. The whole cast and crew were aware of that, and that's its strong point. Except for its extended running time, Pirates doesn't contain any mistake for a blockbuster: a thrilling plot, a few brush-strokes of drama, attractive main characters and a whole world of adventure are its top qualities. The art direction, make-up, costume design, music, cinematography, sound and special FX are excellent as expected from a $225 million movie.<br/><br/>The plot sets off inside an event, a wedding, and finishes in another one, some sort of funeral. It doesn't matter, believe me. The excellent story was written by screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio (same tandem of the first Pirates) so we should not talk about this at all: it is pure entertainment. It's a master class of ""How to make a good entertaining screenplay and not to die in the attempt"". In ten minutes we're in the roller-coaster, and we won't stop before 150 minutes. Too much, I know, but the comical 1920's slapstick movies style mood and the fascinating creatures of this world are enough to hook us to the seat. These are the safety belts of the attraction. You will forget about the WC, the thirst and the hunger.<br/><br/>What about the cast? It's simply excellent. Johnny Depp is unforgettable as Capitan Jack Sparrow: so dirty and bad, he really is a pirate. The Orlando and Keira team is fresher than in the first movie, and the rest of the cast is absolutely hilarious and comic, as the movie needs.<br/><br/>In the next Academy Awards ceremony, I hope to hear the name of Pirates a minimum of five times for the technical departments. To find Pirates in the final Five would be a dream come true, it really deserves it.<br/><br/>More information: www.box office.es"

","Dead man's chest chooses a very risky road many sequels go for - take what worked in the original and move it up a notch. More is better, and yet more is even more better. Unfortunately, the action-packed plot-heavy movies don't leave enough room for the characters.<br/><br/>While I enjoyed the light adventurous atmosphere of ""The curse"", ""Dead man's chest"" with all it's frantic tempo felt like a big mess. Plot moves at relentless speed never pausing to take a breath, one action scene follows another but surprisingly instead of taking me into its grip and not letting go it resulted in boredom. Sure I laughed at some jokes and enjoyed the action here and there but mostly I felt like I'm watching a rushed imitation of something cool. The whole experience was like eating a re-heated gourmet meal - all the right ingredients are there yet it doesn't taste quite the same, and you want to enjoy it but find yourself in constant desire to spit out the chewy cold bits. OK, getting a bit carried away with food metaphors there, but you catch my drift.<br/><br/>Perhaps the thing I really didn't like is how ""Pirates 2"" more often misses then it hits the mark. Take the fruit ke-bob bit for example. Funny? Yes, but when Wile E. Coyote does it, for Johnny Depp it is quite embarrassing. Or how about the fact that the monster can sink a ship in a millisecond when only the extras are on board, yet conveniently takes a much more leisurely pace when our heroes happen to sail on it. Twice, for that matter. Or what the hell was with all that hatcheting and murdering? All the sword fights are basically bloodless yet prisoners freely get their throats cut and butchered up with axes? Am I the only one seeing something wrong with that picture? Or the small fact that the movie is not in any way self standing, but basically provides a convenient set-up for Pirates 3. Want to see how it turns out? Pay up, chum! They didn't even try to put up any kind of closure, you only have a weak twist (heavily advertised before the premiere so hardly a twist at all), a mid-scene cut and yay here go the credits. Cheap, cheap gimmick.<br/><br/>Anyway, I cannot say I didn't have fun with this flick, but remembering how overjoyed I was with the first one the sequel just left me with a ""eh"" feeling. Not bad, but hardly deserving it's current reputation.<br/><br/>6/10 - Disney, be thankful you got Depp, without him this would hardly be a 3-."

Did they need to make a sequel though?!...Probably not buts its all about the $$$$$$$. The first movie did amazing numbers at the Box Office and DMC seems to be doing much of the same and BETTER.<br/><br/>The problem with Dead Man's Chest compared to its predecessor is that its not a lot different and if anything its a wee bit inferior. Its become a little self indulgent in regards to Johnny Depp's character and has just become the CAPTAIN JACK SPARROW SHOW.<br/><br/>The other characters in the movie do not develop any further from the first. The Villain is played wonderfully by Bill Nighly but is no match to Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa in Black Pearl, The plots not as quirky and is possibly a little complicated for the target audience. The CGI is spectacular but over-used and the running time is TOO LONG by about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Overall its a good effort for a sequel and I hope that the 3rd in the trilogy will continue this trend, but we will wait in see.<br/><br/>6/10, Entertaining and enjoyable but a bit too long and inferior to the wonderful gem which is the first movie, Pirate's of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl."

Those were my least favorite parts of Pirates 1 and there was just way too much of it in Pirates 2. Those feel too much like scenes from a zombie movie and even though the graphics are superb, they are still lame. If you can take that in stride then its a very worth-while movie to see.<br/><br/>Some parents may be uncomfortable with the high levels of gross, gore, and violence in the movie from the very start.

All right, let's start the complaining.<br/><br/>First, the film is much too long at nearly 2 hours and thirty minutes. Now, I don't have a problem with long movies, but, in the case of this film, Verbinski pushes us along from one over-the-top action sequence to another until you'll start to wonder whether it will ever end.<br/><br/>Early in the film we learn that, for some reason, Depp owes his soul to Davy Jones and his crew of scallop covered seamen(Rendered here in wonderful CG, in the guise of various forms of aquatic life). The whole situation surrounding Depp's debt to Davy Jones is quite ambiguous and confusing. Director Verbinski does not seek to clarify all of this, but, rather, pushes on onward to the more lively scenes, apparently wanting to make use of his budget.<br/><br/>I won't seek to outline the entire plot for you, but, it does involve island cannibals, some imposing Brits and a giant octopus beast called the ""Kracken,"" which haunts Depp and makes a hobby of devouring ships.<br/><br/>Let me make this known; THERE IS NO REAL MALE LEAD. Will Turner (Bloom) is an effeminate push-over who doesn't ever seem to have much bearing over anything. at one point, the sad sack gets his foot caught in the rigging of a net full of explosive barrels set as an ingenious trap for the aforementioned Kracken (""Is it dead?"" ""No, we've just made it angry"").Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) is a cartoon, pirouetting and gesticulating his way through much of the film. This sort of goofing-off is, usually, to some degree, endearing or comical, but Depp takes it to such an unacceptable level that you will want to punch right through the celluloid theater screen, right at his eye-shadowed face, bedecked in a Chinese sage's beard. This sort of levity makes it hard for us to ever take him seriously, especially when events demand for us to, such as when he is displays fleeting looks of horror, or when he is offered a chance at redemption by Knightley, or, in the laughable ending, charges head-first into the mouth of the Kracken, a creature which, throughout the entire film has planned to eat him, and eventually brings about the clown's demise. Captain Sparrow is also quite fond of saying ""bugger,"" which I recommend he refrain from saying should he ever visit England. In fact, he should know the term's ulterior connotations if he is indeed British, which, despite his hokey accent, we assume he is.Half of the time, the poor bastard just seems too shocked at the world around him, grimacing and making other faces in the vein of Jim Carrey as the situation of his general surroundings changes, especially during fight sequences, like the one in which Turner, Sparrow and some brooding discharged officer of Her Majesty's Royal Navy who vaguely reminds me of Emily Bronte's ""Heathcliff"" face-off in a less than deftly handled and anticlimactic duel(NOTE: another thing enacted anticlimactically- a scene in which Turner bets his soul in a game of dice with Davy Jones. And, yes, Davy Jones. I suppose he's not much of a lead either because, come on, let's face it, who can take him seriously, he has an octopus for a face and speaks in a phony Scottish drawl (plus he plays the organ with the tentacles that replace his beard). And now that we are on the subject of actors-Miss Knightley! The major problem I had with her performance isn't necessarily her problem, it can possibly be accredited to shoddy writing. The character can seem to decide whether she wants to bicker about the boys' foolish behavior, (pouting in the sand as they seek to resolve things by sword point) or be one of them (swigging bilge water rum and handling a blade like a seasoned fencer).<br/><br/>If there is one thing I liked about this film, it is the settings, cinematography and art design, as well as the costume and makeup work. These, however, are, for the most part aesthetic attributes and cannot be the movie's saving grace. As Depp's Sparrow says in the film ""I love these moments. I love to wave at them as they pass by."""
"soccerjg4","3","2","4","26 July 2006"," Could have skipped this movie and just watched the third. . .
","I am not sure why everyone thinks that this movie is so great. The movie started, there were some big bangs and a few comical lines, and then ended, not resolving anything that it had started. I do not want to spoil a pointless movie for others, but it seems as if Disney just wanted you to feel like you HAVE to see the third movie just to get some closure. You wait around for 2.5 hours only to finish the movie exactly where it began and with an empty space in your wallet where your money used to be. I wont ever watch this again and if I buy the collection then I will only buy the first and the third movies as this one was totally pointless."
"eightie","6","2","4","24 July 2006"," There's no shortage of pirates, that's for sure
","Let me start by saying that I really loved the first ""Pirates"", and watched it 3 times. I was looking forward to this sequel. It proved to be an adequate sequel in that it connected the first movie to a (yet unreleased) third, but that is about all. Don't get me wrong: I liked many things about this movie: the special effects were great, the diversity of the pirates was enhanced (I particularly liked the hammerhead guy), and the line between good and evil was blurred, which is a good thing in a pirate movie.<br/><br/>The main shortcoming of this movie is that it has only two talented actors: Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy (Davey Jones). The rest give a bland, forgettable performance that does not even rise to the level of a caricature. Bloom and Knightley seem to have the chemistry of Bill and Hillary Clinton: during the fighting scene she doesn't seem to care her fiancé is in danger and doesn't come to his aid. It's each one for himself in this movie, be they engaged to be married, good friends or longtime shipmates. There is no camaraderie, there is no love, and there is no loyalty.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes are good at times, silly at others (the watermill wheel sequence is a good example), and the plot line is very thin indeed. I got to hand it to the director, though: no one has ever had more pirates featured in a pirate movie: with the exception of a few British soldiers and some cannibals, every one in this movie is a pirate. Even those who didn't start out as pirates become so before the end credits role. Oddly enough none of them are ever seen robbing merchant ships or innocent civilians, but occupy all of their time pursuing hidden treasure chests and Jamaican-accented witches who know how to find them.<br/><br/>But overall, I can't say I felt like asking for my money back. It was good entertainment for $9, and I will give the third installment a try. Who knows? They might introduce non-pirate characters and have Jack Sparrow and the Kraken live happily ever after (there must be SOME chemistry, Verbinski!)."
"siderite","7","2","4","24 July 2006"," The three part saga thing is starting to annoy me
","It started a long time ago (in a galaxy not so far far away) when films started to mix with TV series and transform into sagas. Even the name annoys the hell out of me. If it's on TV, it's a mini series, if it's on the big screen it's a saga!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the same thing happened to Pirates of the Caribbean. The second part is less funny and intriguing, has a lot of special effects, and the characters transform dramatically in order to make the link to the third part. Of course, just reediting the first part wouldn't have been good either. I guess what really bothered me is that this film cannot be taken separately from the first and (apparently) from the third. It's just the middle of something bigger and you can't truly enjoy it for itself. They went the Matrix way: the first film nice and interesting, then a two part second part which they name 2 and 3, just for kicks and which you can't really separate from each other.<br/><br/>But it was also a good film. Johhny Depp does wonders once again, even if he lost that charming wavy way of standing. The evil spooks are not even more spooky and the human and mollusk look payed off. It look great. Keira Knightley... I really made efforts to like her. She even seemed sexy when she first rose to stardom, but for whatever reason I just can't stand the woman now. Orlando Bloom is co-starring. I can't put it any other way, he is there just for filling up space. He could have had a better and more complex role. I loved Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, captain of the mollusk pirates.<br/><br/>I just have to say something about Naomie Harris. She is HOT! The cute Jamaican accent thing and the fine, yet complex movements of lips make her look terribly sexy. She plays a minor role, yet she does it in style.<br/><br/>Bottom line: it's a nice continuation. Could have been better and it's more than a sequel. But since it is a fun movie to begin with, you will probably have fun either way."
"Creepygeeky6","6","2","4","23 July 2006"," Watching Space...
","I really feel like I just watched 2 hours of Space. Like what they had to say was really just about 30 minutes worth of plot movement and the rest was to show case their academy nominated talent and amazing vfx. This was more the promo video at a scifi convention and less the movie part 1 was made of. <br/><br/>The actors really flopped as well. Jack Sparrow was wonderful, but Johnny seldom fails in his delivery. Sometimes he picks bad scripts, but regardless his delivery is always on. He was the only human actor that did this with this plot less tale. Orlando and Keira really missed the mark. Sometimes you can tell when an actor is already swinging for the fences and strikes out completely.With these two actors that is exactly what happened. There was no levels in their performance and no memorable moment. <br/><br/>The second savior of the film (The first being Jack Sparrow) was Davy Jones. WELL DONE!!! I am so glad I live in an age where claytronics don't exist and characters like Davey Jones does. I couldn't stop staring and couldn't get enough. Jerry Bruckheimer should be kissing who ever did the VFX's rear, because without that this movie would have flopped. <br/><br/>At the very least he should give his writers a smack on the wrists as they didn't fill the void of a second movie with amazing content, instead they left it empty with the occasional change of scenery."
"godfailed256","6","2","4","18 July 2006"," Pirates of Caribbean = Star Wars trilogy on a pirate ship
","Let's see: Black Pearl = millennium Falcon, Jack Sparrow = Han Solo, Will Turner = Luke Skywalker, Elizabeth = Leia, Bootstrap Bill = Darth Vader, Davy Jones = Emperor, Leviathan = Carbonite. Everything is the same. Slight story change does not make a new movie. It is a kick in the teeth. They think that the American population is too stupid to realize this. They are banking off of the same trilogy twice. We are paying. I just don't get it. This really upsets me. Be ready for the pirate remake of return of the jedi. It wouldn't surprise me if Elizabeth turned out to be Will's sister. I would put money on it. I hope I am not the only one who realized this."
"julietgale","6","2","4","18 July 2006"," Fun to watch, but script is shabby
","This film is very entertaining...its hard not to enjoy the performances, especially Johnny Depp prancing around as Cap'n Jack. There are some fantastic special effects (Davy Jones for instance) and a lot of really fun scenes, but I came out of the cinema thinking ""huh?"" <br/><br/>The script is really disjointed, and there seem to be large sections added in just for the sake of creating action sequences (if you see it you'll know what sections I mean). The storyline is too complex and you are expected to understand who characters are and their motivations without these being explained very well. For this reason, its not an amazing film - highly enjoyable, looks great, very funny, but not (in my opinion) as well crafted a story as the first installment."
"tghood15","Null","2","4","18 July 2006"," Great Cliffhanger
","Originally I was going to see The Da Vinci Code this weekend but instead wound up seeing Pirates of the Caribbean DMC. I must say I was in for an an unexpected treat. I did like the first one but didn't really expect much as far as a continuing plot goes. The second movie comes out with both guns a blazing. There is plenty of great stunt work and even better plenty of plot with just the right balance of CGI. The actor who plays Davy Jones who was also in Underworld and Love Actually is slowly becoming one of my favorite actors. He carries a certain amount of charm and subtlety which one can see even through all the tentacles of the squid effects. Depp returns with all the great mannerisms that made Captain Jack Sparrow a household name. True he didn't exactly come out of left field as he did with the first movie, but one just has to love this character if not merely for the fact you never know what he will do next. Good supporting roles by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly although I would like to have seen Knightly's character be a bit more brash. Oh well perhaps in the third installment. I say bring on the scalawags. I can't wait to see how it ends."
"krysia1","8","2","4","18 July 2006"," Really good but really gross!
","I loved this movie for a number of reasons: 1.lots of comic situations featuring Jack Sparrow at his most animated (where does he get those fabulous facial expressions) 2. A nice heroic bit for Will Turner 3. Elizabeth as an aggressor 4. good plot twists 5. My two favorite bumbling characters are back<br/><br/>What I did not like was the gore and ooze dripping from Davy Jones and his crew; they actually made me gag. For this reason I won't see the film in the theaters again, but I certainly will enjoy it on DVD where I can fast forward past the icky stuff.<br/><br/>See it by all means, just don't eat anything while you watch."

","""Chest"" is darker, wetter, and sometimes ""ickier"" than ""Pearl"", but also funnier and goofier at times. Saw it 7-9-06 with my husband, and enjoyed it, but not in love with it. Went again with a friend on the 16th, and really really liked it (almost ""love"", not quite--maybe that will come with a third viewing!) <br/><br/>Depp is terrific throughout, as we may always assume he will be (let us face it, without him, there would not have been a second ""Pirates""), and it is great to be able to look forward to (at least) one more installment before the character (ostensibly) retires next May.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone who saw and liked the first, but I would also strongly suggest watching the first one again before you go. There are several references (mostly humorous) you will enjoy more if your memory has been recently refreshed! Cheers all!"
"pineapple_1013","9","2","4","17 July 2006"," Hello Beastie.
","I have heard this movie likened to ""Empire Strikes Back"", and while the star wars fan in me wants to protest, I can't. That's a really craking good description of it. I think that, assuming the third film is as good as this one was, Pirates of the Caribbean may become the Star Wars of our generation, since the Star Wars of our generation was ultimately disappointing.<br/><br/>The film begins beautifully. Very beautifully, actually. A number of shots of Will and Elizabeth's ruined rainined on wedding, with Kiera Knightly (the appeal of whom I will never understand) looking genuinely tragic kneeling in her dress in the rain. Turns out the proverbial sh*t has hit the fan and she and Will (and a conspicuosly absent Norrington) are under arrest for helping everyone's favorite flamboyant, Captain Jack. Meanwhile, back at the Turkish prison, Johnny Depp makes one of the better entrances in sequel history, which I won't ruin for those who haven't seen the film. The tone for the movie is set with these two scenes, the ruined promise of a fairy tale wedding and the Gothic hopelessness (with a hint of mythic whimsey) of the prison with it's floating coffins. This movie is not the same as it's predecessor, in that it is much darker, and that makes all the difference.<br/><br/>The plot, to be fair, is a bit contrived and many bits of the film are borrowed (read: stolen) from a myriad of sources, including itself, but that doesn't make the film any less fun. This swash buckles, no ifs ands or buts. The sword fights are great (can you say three way sword fight on a rolling water wheel? now you can!) the ship battles are decent (if a bit too reminiscent of the last movie) and I have one word for ya: Kraken. Kicks butt, it does. Very cool.<br/><br/>Davy Jones and his carbunkled crew are awesome, and Bill Nighy does a wonderful job of acting with a cepholopod for a head. The character shows hints of being complex underneat the ""villain of the week"" exterior, and I like the idea of sailors pledging their souls to him to delay the inevitable. It's almost (almost) deep for a summer movie. And the ""Will, I am your father"" angst that occurred on the boat was a nice touch. Too bad Orlando Bloom squandered it by being a pretty poor actor.<br/><br/>As for actors, I was very excited to see Norrington back in this one, and let me say, he is very likable as a ruined man. Likable in a love to want to love him but still kinda hate him way. Kiera Knightly and Orlando Bloom are opposite sides of the same cavernous cheekboned coin. Orlando spends too much time trying to be pretty and subtle and comes off as bland. Kiera (who improves a bit as the film goes on, but still) spends too much time trying to be pretty and fiesty and comes off as over done. Johnny Depp, of course, is fantastic. It's really his movie and he makes the most of it. He's probably the best actor in Hollywood right now. He makes strange decisions for some of his movies (libertine, anyone?) but he's amazing.<br/><br/>A note: this isn't a comedy. Not inasmuch as the last movie was. It has hysterically funny moments, don't' get me wrong. But this is a dark little adventure story. The ending makes that clear. Who'd have thought that Machiavelli's prince was lurking beneath Elizabeth's cookie cutter fiesty rich girl persona? Nicely done.<br/><br/>Finally, I've heard complaints about this being too much a set up for the next movie. Second act, folks, it's to be expected. My one concern (SPOILER LIKE YOU CANT BELIEVE) is that with Sparrow somewhat eaten by the kraken and the point being to go find him, I worry too much of the movie will be absent Johnny Depp. And while Geoffery Rush may be able to carry the film a bit, Bloom and Knightly most definitely can't."
"HeyJude014","7","2","4","18 July 2006"," Wow.
","Now, I debated with myself for quite some time before writing this review. I loved it, but... I hated it at the same time. This movie will cause me to lose some serious sleep for the next few nights.<br/><br/>SO.... i'm just gunna dive in, and stop myself when I can't breathe anymore. <br/><br/>This movie picks up exactly where the last one left off. We open the movie with a very depressing scene of Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) wearing a beautiful wedding dress drenched in rain water, surrounded by the remains of a ruined wedding. Her fiancé, William Turner (Orlando Bloom *gags*), is led into the movie wearing handcuffs. But, none of this is very exciting, just depressing.<br/><br/>The excitement begins when our main character, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), makes his grand entrance... in a coffin, shooting a crow. What did you expect? If you recall, in the last movie, he made his grand entrance on a sinking ship... only a stunt Captain Jack Sparrow could pull off.<br/><br/>Now... this is where the love-hate comes in. This movie seems to drag on and on as if it's never going to end (that's the hate part), BUT somehow manages to keep you excited and on the edge of your seat the whole time (if you did the math, you should be able to figure out that's the love part). <br/><br/>And... this is normally where I start diving into the plot... BUT it's rather hard, because, where do I start?... Well... okay, we learn in this movie that the Black Pearl was actually given to Captain Jack by Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), a weird creature-ish thing that lives for the sea (I believe his words were ""I am the sea!""). He has tentacles for a beard, and half of him is lobster-ish while the other part is octopus-ish. He harbors a crew of the dead (well, i guess not really, but they might as well be). They are also weird fish-like things that have given their souls to Davey Jones for 100 years so that they didn't have to die when his Kraken (HUGE SQUID MONSTER) obliterates their ship. Among this crew is Bill ""Bootstrap"" Turner (Stellan Starsgard), William Turner's twice-cursed father.<br/><br/>Back to the Black Pearl part. Jack made a deal with Davey Jones, which pretty much stated that he could be Captain of the Pearl for 13 years, and those 13 years are up, so now Jack owes Davey a debt (his soul =D). Jack doesn't quite want to give up his soul, so he goes after Dead Man's Chest... hence the title. Now, in Dead Man's Chest lies something valuable to Davey, something that, if in the wrong hands, could kill him.<br/><br/>But Jack isn't the only one after the chest before too long. We see the return of an old character who was after Jack Sparrow but ends up going for the chest too, plus the East India Trading company is pretty much starting to take over, and they want the sea, therefore they want control of Davey Jones, therefore they want what's in the chest. William Turner wanted Jack's ""special"" compass so that he may save his dearest Lizzy, but she escapes anyway, soooo soon enough he is also after the chest so that he may save his father from Davey Jones' locker instead. sooo... Ragetti (guy with wooden eyeball) pretty much sums it up in his line ""Well, each man wants the chest for hisself, don't 'e? Mr Norrington, I think, is trying to regain a bit of honor. Old Jack's looking to trade it, save his own skin. And Turner there-I think 'e's trying to settle some unresolved business twix him and his twice-cursed Pirate father.""<br/><br/>From there... well that's pretty much what the entire movie is about. All two and a half hours of it. See what I meant by ""drags on""? <br/><br/>Then... ugh, the biggest drop-off ending in the HISTORY of drop-off endings. (If you haven't seen the movie and are still reading, STOP where you are) Davey Jones finally catches up with the Pearl, and he sics his giant squid Kraken on it... through a series of unfortunate events which in no way involve Elizabeth and Jack a'tall, the crew of the ship gets away, excluding Jack, who we last see ""attacking"" the Kraken very dramatically... norrington gives what's in the chest to the leader of the East India Trading Company... Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) tells the crew that they can save everything if they are willing to travel ""to de end of de eart and beyond""... if they do that, they need a captain... and quite possibly the best, and worst, ending of all time... we see the boots of former Pearl captain Barbossa clunking down dramatically on the steps of Tia Dalma's hut. He stands before them all, wearing a satisfied grin with his monkey perched comfortably on his shoulder. ""So now, what's become of my ship?"" he asks mischievously. He then takes a chomp out of a ripe green apple, and the juice slithers down his chin and into his beard.<br/><br/>End credits."
"natlig","5","2","4","17 July 2006"," Going the Starwars way is not always right.
","----Slight spoiler---- Isn't it funny that all recent successful movies such as Matrix, Lord of the Rings (maybe Austin Powers) go after John Lucas' way with original Starwars and Indiana Jones and aim the golden hat trick (3 goals in a match)? However, all these sequels failed to satisfy me as original Starwars and Indiana Jones did. This is the way I felt with this movie also.<br/><br/>I think the original Starwars sequels were successful, because the epic mood of the story did not change with the new movies. On the contrary, the sequels fueled the story and the mystery right till the end. Indiana Jones is a different, more fun story full with adventure and exoticism. The sequels, therefore, were two distinct movies and two distinct adventures not bothering with continuing the previous film.<br/><br/>I think that Pirates of the Carribian is more similar to Indiana Jones than to Starwars. The first movie was a very high tempo adventure film with very good written humor.<br/><br/>In the second movie, for the sake of keeping the cast trio the same, the story is transforming to a Starwars like saga. William Turner (aka Luke Skywalker) is meeting his re-born father (Darth Vader), who is under the control of Davy Jones (Emperor). He is also in love with Elizabeth Swann (Leia Skywalker), but Elizabeth cannot decide between him and Captain Jack Sparrow (Han Solo). However, these relationships were only side stories in the first movie. I think it would be much more better, if this second movie was a completely new one as the second adventure of Jack Sparrow maybe with minor appearances by William and Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Another irritating factor was the heavy make-up flying Dutchman creatures. The first movie was much more realistic in this sense. But that is always the case with sequels. I believe that the virtual world in original Starwars series also was much more realistic than the revamped, computer animated and disappointing Episode I-III series. I hate the cold realization that a shot is computer animated."
"snyper1185","9","2","4","17 July 2006"," This movie did everything a sequel should do
","I went into this movie not expecting anything. I didn't think they would be able to make a movie as good as the first. I thought they would go the safe route and simply remake the first one, only have a different backdrop.<br/><br/>I have never been so glad to be wrong.<br/><br/>For the first 30 to 45 minutes, I was cringing. They kept referencing the first movie in such a way it seemed to me they were saying, ""We had a huge hit with the first movie and it was a lot of fun, so don't forget it!"". It seemed they weren't sure this movie was going to do well, so they had to keep reminding people how well the first movie did. But it slowly and surely started to change. The first sign of the change was the arrival of Davy Jones. You know an actor does an amazing job when someone can recognize who they are, beneath prosthetics and CGI. Bill Nighy plays Davy Jones, and does a wonderfully brilliant job.<br/><br/>The next sign was the characters started to change. Elizabeth and Jack Sparrow in particular. Both of the characters were explored in such a way that it showed them to be real people, and not one-dimensional movie characters. They were real people. Jack Sparrow was a pirate and made decisions like a pirate. The only character that wasn't memorable was Will Turner. The reason for that I believe is that he was exactly the same character as in the first movie. He was static, nothing changed with him, his character wasn't pursued. Jack, Elizabeth, and a third character were dynamic and changing, and therefore interesting. Will was not. This third character arrived, and at first, I wasn't sure why he was in this movie, but it was a very good choice.<br/><br/>The story takes this Pirates far beyond the scope of the first. It is much more epic, but at the same time it is more focused on the characters and their fights and inner turmoil. Perhaps that is why it seems so epic.<br/><br/>The music, though not done by the original composer, is very much a credit to this movie. It still has some of the recognizable themes from the first movie, but takes it further.<br/><br/>This movie has some funny parts and very well done scenes. Several of the fights are very memorable, as are the characters faces during those fights. Johnny Depp stated that he purposefully took Jack Sparrow in a funnier direction. Despite all of this, however, it is a much heavier movie. The last hour of the movie is a continual desperate life or death fight.<br/><br/>I'm sure you've heard that this movie ends on a cliffhanger. I tend to disagree. This movie ends with all its loose ends wrapped up nicely. It had closure, but opened the door for the third movie. Go into the movie thinking this, that Pirates of the Caribbean is a series. You've watched the first episode, and now you're going to see the second episode. Don't take it as a standalone movie, because it's not, and it wasn't made to be.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie did everything a sequel should do. It is not the first movie, and that is a good thing. If you go into it wanting it to be like the first one, well, just go watch the first one again. You most likely won't like this movie. I prefer a sequel to be new and interesting, not old and predictable. This movie did build upon the first, but expanded the storyline and made it more epic. It took (most) of the characters into new and uncharted territories, delving into their humanity. It nicely answered most of the questions, but left a few unanswered until the third. And lastly, the final scene makes you excited to go see the third. I wholeheartedly recommend going to see this movie"
"kittorino","5","2","4","17 July 2006"," A great, big downer....
","I hate to say it, but this movie was a great big disappointment. Ever since I saw Curse of the Black Pearl, and found out there was coming a number 2, I looked forward to it so much i almost cried. I think that the plot was bad, the humor was repeated from the first movie, and all those people that showed up messed up the whole thing. I know that it's not a very serious movie and that its supposed to be funny, but it could have kept some of the charm that was in the first movie. I missed the amazing dialogs from Jack Sparrow that i loved so much. Also I thought that the start was a little off, but then i saw the end.<br/><br/>I might have had some high hopes, but I'm not planning on sinking so far down that I can say that i liked it.<br/><br/>Hopefully I'm the only one who didn't like it and that all you other Potc-lover like it a lot more..."
"toddhaskins","5","2","4","16 July 2006"," A mixed bag...
","It's a mixed bag for sure. I came out of this movie thoroughly annoyed and disappointed, while one of my friends came out excited and feeling quite fulfilled. So, why the difference? I cannot speak for her, but I will do my best to explain what I thought of the film.<br/><br/>My initial response once the film ended was that it was unnecessarily drawn out. There were two extremely long action sequences that added nothing to the plot, and it seemed like they had only been placed there to fill some time. I do want to point out that I did think that the main plot was fine, but they could have covered the 2nd and 3rd film all in this film - another film is not necessary for the same story.<br/><br/>One other thing that bothered me was the fact that so much money was being spent on the film and yet there were so many times when it just jumped out at you screaming - Hey, Look at us standing in front of this huge blue screen! Considering the scope of the film, you would think that they would take more time to make it seem more realistic. Though I shouldn't talk, it's better than I could ever do. And some of the scenes and imagery was amazing!!! The characters were as they usually were. They were fun. But there didn't seem to be the same passion as the first film. Very little development, and where things did happen, it wasn't really believable. Perhaps the characterization was left as it was because there is going to be a 3rd movie - which really is just acting as the second half of this second movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you really love the Pirate movies, you will probably enjoy this one too. If you are just somewhere in the middle with it all, you will probably be like me and wish you had just decided to see anything else. It's not a strong sequel, but a sequel nonetheless - and that is enough to keep some people happy."

","Bottom line. If you are only able to watch one movie during the summer of 2006, your best bet is Superman.<br/><br/>In the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, Dead Man's Chest's position can be summed up in 2 words. Matrix Reloaded. Not just in its overratedness, but in its premise as well.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest begins with a poorly portrayed villainous Lord who wants Jack Sparrows compass, and coercers Will Turner to retrieve it for him. This then leads the crew of the pirate ship Black Pearl on an adventure to face off Davy Jones, captain of the feared ghost ship Flying Dutchman. Which will lead us to a trilogy for the fate of Jack Sparrow, the destiny of Will Turner, and the fate of the crew of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp does an excellent job of restoring Jack Sparrow, captain of the Black Pearl, who is also the comedy relief. And wouldn't be surprised if another Oscar is nominated for him. The other cast members including Kira Knightly and Orlando Bloom also revive their characters just as well.<br/><br/>The movie during the first half of the movie is really fun, warranting a 9/10. Extremely funny, adventurous, and action packed. Defiantely worth seeing. But then, the movie takes a turn for the worst during the second half for when the real adventure starts during the second half, it starts to wind down. Where suspense and pace seriously starts to become lax, to the point where the gags start to become less effective.<br/><br/>In comparison, it doesn't even come close to being as good as The Curse of the Black Pearl. Started out with an incredible movie, now it's starting to ripen.<br/><br/>Now what does this mean for the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise? Will it follow the footsteps of Lord of the Rings and Superman? Where it starts out with an incredible first movie, the sequel or series of sequels becomes lax, and then returns with an incredible latest installment or trilogy? Or will it follow the footsteps of Robocop, the Matrix, and Star Wars? Where they start off with one great film, and then the subsequent sequels/prequels just get worse and worse and worse? Only time will tell with the release of Pirates 3.<br/><br/>Give Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest ..... 6.5 out of 10.<br/><br/>And the point five is being kind to the Pirates fans."
"beth-fraser","7","2","4","16 July 2006"," Good fun, but...
","I saw this film with an open mind as I LOVED the first one. Unfortunately, the script writers seemed to be wanting about seven sequels, were told they'd only get two, so they threw in as much as they could with this one. I found it a bit too full, and ended up looking at my watch a few times to see when the open-ending I'd been warned about would be occurring. The film didn't hold my attention like the first.<br/><br/>What is with that open ending thing anyway? I've been annoyed at George Lucas ever since ""The Empire Strikes Back"" for that sort of thing, and the Matrix did it too. Why can't films end properly, THEN give us a sequel? It's like they are too lazy to bother or something.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was good to see Keira Knightly brandishing a sword and not just doing the damsel-in-distress thing. Orlando got to swash his buckle too, but didn't anybody else think that sword fight on the giant wheel went on a bit too long?<br/><br/>There was too little central-characters-together-on screen going on for me; I liked their chemistry last time. This time it all seemed a bit forced and disjointed.<br/><br/>Let's put it this way; I am glad I saw it, but, unlike ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" I won't bother buying this one."

","When i went to see this film i was really excited as i expected it to be better than the first one but i was slightly disappointed. I thought the main plot was very good and there was a lot of funny parts but there was too many subplots and that ruined it a bit. What did surprise was at the end Captain Barbossa came back which was a bit confusing because he died in the first one but I'm glad he's back because the next on is going to be really good and i can't wait for it to come out. Overall i found it quite entertaining and funny but there was no point to the subplots, it would have been so much better if they had left those subplots out but yeah overall pretty good."

","For the genre of the movie and the fact that it had the ""sequel"" curse to fight, I think this movie was better than I expected. The locations were great and the action, even if the movie was a little long, was well worth seeing it in theaters. I know a lot of people are iffy about the ending, but I found it was well done. It's not like it leaves you in the middle of the adventure, you still get a sense of it being an entity on its own.<br/><br/>The only things I didn't like about it were 1) the make-up (ok, Keira's beautiful but does her face have to look pristine after a fight?), and 2) the big difference in accents and ""level of education"" between characters.<br/><br/>If you approach the movie like you're going to see a movie version of a book - and you know the story could have been better - you'll still like the experience. And because, not in spite of, the ending, it's a lot better than I expected."

Plot seemed consistent and referenced many things for Pirates 1 if you listened closely to what was said in the first movie.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in that it so blatantly set up Pirates 3. It didn't need to be that obvious. There is enough pirate folklore that Pirates 2 did not need to relate to Pirates 1 nor Pirates 3 for that matter, and believe it could hold its own.<br/><br/>Davy Jones was good, but just a bit over the top for me. It seemed to be forced in a way. I wanted to see more piracy like there was in Pirates 1 and less ""Hollywood"" special effects.<br/><br/>Am going to go see it, again, just to make sure I agree with what I just wrote.

"lockelymarkets","7","2","4","15 July 2006"," OK, but it needs a better ending
","This review may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>PC2: Dead Mans chest is a great sequel to the first. It starts pretty much where the last ended. Although I saw it at an unpopular movie, I got to see it on its 2nd day in cinemas and I was amazed at what Walt Disney can do outside of cartoons. It had great suspense and silent sadness, but it was good. The main part I like about the Pirates of the Caribbean movies is that they have violence with out the yucking. I've seen other movies like Jurassic Park which show all the yuck bits, but PC is great. Ill get straight to the point. Johnny Depp is good for the role of Jack Sparrow because he acts so ""stupid (well in a way"" but then you find out later that he's really sly and suspicious. The other characters were good as well; I have no idea who the witch woman is, she wasn't properly introduced. I rated this movie 7 because of its terrible ending. When the credits came up, i thought it was a joke. What happened to Jack Sparrow and the Black Pearl? Is Captain Barbossa good or evil and why did he only appear at the end of the movie? What happened to Captain Norrington and how did he get Davie Jones's heart? These are some of the many questions that floated into my mind as I went home after viewing the movie. I really hope Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End, will solve my questions. <br/><br/>Overall it was a terrific movie and I would certainly see it again on DVD."

","PotC2 is one of those movies that has a lot of great assets to it, but then has so many damn plot holes and unfinished business that you want to punch Keira Knightley for being such a hot snob...? The main characters were lousy: Johnny Depp was just average, Keira Knightley's character was loathsome, especially towards the end of the film, Orlando Bloom was the most likable, and most heroic...The movie's sole redeeming features were the unbelievable FX. Davy Jones' crew and himself were over the top and badass, but the film's main monster was kind of a letdown. The film was also too damn long, with some scenes growing monotonous even with crazy crap going on. Man, I was disappointed with this flick; all I wanted to do was be entertained, and I ended up hating Keira Knightley, and Jack Sparrow for that matter. Maybe the next one will give a little rehash on Sparrow's life, and possibly redeem the lackluster screen time he had in this FX laden, FX carrying, letdown. Did I mention the Fx were great?"
"KiTheHpFreak","7","2","4","13 July 2006"," overall good movie with some faults.
","Good but not as Good. Something felt wrong. This one wasn't sugarcoated which is a plus. One of the bad factors is how complex the storyline is. It was almost confusing. Action was high, Comedy was crazy high too the point I thought they were trying a bit hard. The first one's ending was better. This One is Like TADA! GO SEE TREQUEL ( is that even a word?). If you really don't want to see this movie don't it isn't worth the 10 bucks for admission unless you're into it. The casting was amazing. So was the scenery. It literally takes your breath away. I do think it's a little too complicated and scary for little kids so if you were planning on taking your kids or your siblings I wouldn't. I definitely liked the first one better."
"ladye316","6","2","4","13 July 2006"," Too long!
","I saw this move pretty late at night and I don't know if I was in the wrong frame of mind to watch this movie but I thought that they were trying to do too much in one movie. Too many plot lines, too many characters, however interesting they may be, too many story lines. My main problem with this movie is the length. 150 minutes is a long time for any movie, but especially one of this nature. This has huge entertainment value, in other words people come to see this movie for fun. It loses much of that due to some slow parts during the movie. Possible I need to watch the first movie again to get into the spirit. However the effects of Davy Jones and his crew are impressive."
"kidnikki84-1","5","2","4","12 July 2006"," Not the worst sequel, but definitely NOT as good as the first....
","So, I never expect too much out of a sequel. They are almost NEVER as good as the first, and if you don't expect much you usually aren't disappointed. However, I was pretty excited about this film. <br/><br/>It was alright.<br/><br/>Overall, the film wasn't as funny and the story was lacking. It was VERY over the top. (I mean come on...Davy Jones plays the organ with his squid-face tentacles!!) Also, I felt that the characters were not consistent with the original. At the end of The Curse of the Black Pearl, Elizabeth, Will, and Jack are a team. There is a strong loyalty between the three. In Dead Man's Chest, this seems to have disappeared. I thought that was a wrong choice. And the villain, Davy Jones, is much more evil and much less entertaining than the original villain, Captain Barbosa.<br/><br/>This film fell prey to the thought that the sequel must be bigger than the first. There was more action and more special effects than the first (and YES, they were impressive) but they didn't necessarily add anything spectacular to the overall film. They could have kept to a simpler story with less frills and stronger writing and this would have been a better film.<br/><br/>One bright spot, however, is the ending. I thought it was a wonderful twist and I very much enjoyed seeing an old friend from the first film....I will be going to see number 3."

"Tomahawk513","4","2","4","11 July 2006"," Waste of money.
","BO-ring. It's a 2.5 hours of almost nothing happening. <br/><br/>Now, where to start. There are almost no lead-ins from the first movie to the second, and many things need them, as they clearly affect the lives of many of the main characters. The Kracken (sp?) is a prime example. Huge ship-eating ""beasties"" don't come out of nowhere. For example, if they're building a Walmart in your area, you probably know about it well ahead of time. Walmarts don't just pop up overnight. Yet I certainly don't recall any mention of it in the first movie. It would be nice to have known of Davy Jones ahead of time, as Sparrow's debt clearly sways his actions and behaviors. The only reason I knew the Black Spot was a terrible sign in pirate lore was from Muppets' Treasure Island (a much more entertaining film, by the way, although strikingly similar plots.. hmmm...). <br/><br/>Speaking of Davy Jones, how does the powder for his guns stay dry during their submarine-like dives? Since this movie probably takes place during the early 1700s, the hayday for Caribbean Pirates, I can say w/ utmost certainty that the technology required to seal wooden barrels so they're watertight hasn't yet been discovered. Granted they somehow found a way, the rate of fire on the three revolving guns is entirely impossible. At the time when the British Navy defeated the Spanish Armada, a British seaman could fire a cannon maybe twice in the course of a minute, and the Brits were some of the fastest in the world. Why not equip his ship w/ German 88s? At least that would be believable. <br/><br/>On another note, I strongly disliked the swordfights in the movie. Nowhere during the ""West-Side-Story""-like fighting did I get the impression that anybody was under any threat of dying. This is especially true during the three-way swordfight. It looked much more like they were dancing and prancing around an old Spanish monastery, swinging their shiny swords playfully at one another. The wheel battle doesn't help this conception either. And where did Miss Swan pick up swordplay? Many of these men have trained for years handling swords. Many pirates were even ex-privateers for the British, Spanish, French, or Dutch navies. So it makes no sense that a young woman raised in a respected upperclass family would be able to defeat one cutthroat, bloodthirsty, and most importantly TRAINED pirate, much less a raiding party of them. <br/><br/>Now, what have I forgotten? Oh that's right, character development! Let's start w/ Kiera Knightly's character, Elizabeth Swan. Who does she love? Turner? Sparrow? Both? If Swan wasn't engaged to Will Turner, I would have no problem w/ her sparks for the Captain, but since she's betrothed to our dear old Will, it creates a very soapy atmosphere amidst the Black Pearl. Don't think she's got feelings for Sparrow? Then why does the compass point his way when they're about to dig up the heart? Also, at the very end, she seems at least as, if not more distraught than the very crew of the Black Pearl at loosing their dear old Captian. Will Turner seems very composed. Why the discrepancy? Will Turner is blindly ambitions, far past the point of recklessness. Apparently he's never heard the saying, ""Discretion is the better part of valor."" What really sealed the deal for me though is when he prepares to board the wrecked ship, the scene leading to the introduction of the Flying Dutchman. Upon being asked what his course of action will be upon encountering an enemy, he replies, ""Cut them down."" Oh, okay, it's just that easy, huh? That's a fantastic ideal Will, let's just jump on board a notorious ship probably ridden w/ enemies of who knows what kind and hope the skills gained during our non-military background are enough to overcome anything. One Cutlass: 35 Galleons Travelling expenses to Black Pearl: 20 Galleons Reckless Bravery: Arrogance Defeating all that Heaven or Hell, or Davy Jones' Locker can throw at me w/ no training in swordplay: Priceless There are some things money can't buy, for everything else, there's Hollywood. <br/><br/>I have nothing bad to say about Jack Sparrow's development. Oh wait, except that massive plothole where he became chief of the cannibals. Say, how did you manage to fool them, Jack? What happened there? Maybe it was his strange, perpetually drunk behavior, I don't know, maybe I sneezed during that 10 minute segment and missed everything. And what kind of wood is he tied to? I've never seen a bamboo shoot flex that much before, but I could just be wrong about that. What I find particularly annoying is how the fruit causes him to loose balance. If it slides so easily up and down the shaft, why were the g-forces during his flip not enough to throw them off? Instead, he falls off his perch, throw several bridges, down hundreds of yards, and lands safely on the ground after the pole lodges itself a foot from his head. Nothing, save the grace of God himself, could save you from that fall. Gravity is a powerful thing. Jack Sparrow would've hit the ground w/ such speed (enough to break several wooden boards multiple times) that he would've fractured most the bones in his body (probably many from the wooden bridges) including his back and skull and died on the spot. But where there's a will, there's a... Hollywood. Don't believe me? Do a belly-flopper off the roof of your house. You probably won't die, but you might break some ribs and probably your nose too. <br/><br/>All in all, this was a pretty horrendous excuse for a movie. My 1000 words are up, just a hair over 950."
"leglevy","6","2","4","12 July 2006"," Fun set pieces in a movie that loves to swim in circles
","Pirates II is a fun summer movie. It has its share of laughs, romance and convincing CGI. It's a charming piece, a charming Pirate movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, the lines above are about the only good points about this unnecessary sequel. It seems the rush to bring it to theaters resulted in a 150 min ""preview-from-hell"" that, although amusing at times, gets repetitive and incomprehensible very early in the game.<br/><br/>It's very clear that there's no real storyline. All we get is another dumb McGuffin device (whoa, a BOX) and a collection of set pieces that barely relate to each other. There's no sense of purpose, no notion of continuity or consequence. Like a David Lynch pic - in a bad way.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski is a very talented guy. If Pirates is even watchable, that is a testament to his skill as a director. It looks and sounds amazing; Verbinki always picks the best shots. We can see he was trying very hard to turn this mess into a great movie. Kudos for him.<br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, this time Depp was way off in his Keith Richards impersonation. Of course it's funny but soon enough we get bored of Orlando Bloom (aka ""the hero"") and eventually expect more from Jack Sparrow. We never get it. He seems uncomfortable having to repeat the same old tricks in the sequel. As for the rest of the cast, they do the best they can but there's no escaping a poorly written script.<br/><br/>In the end, Pirates II is just another example of a franchise gone bad, much like The Matrix Reloaded before it. Today we know that the only reason Reloaded made so much money was that it had the momentum of the first one, not that the Wachowski brothers had found some new and improved way of hypnotizing an audience. I bet the third one will not do as well.<br/><br/>So, for those brave enough, go see it and enjoy the special effects in a big screen with good Dolby or DTS sound. It's worth 10 dollars - and you might even have some laughs added as a bonus. However, expect nothing else or disappointment will ensue."
"ch4151","7","2","4","11 July 2006"," Fun, worthy of a super-sized popcorns. But I almost want to rename it POTC: The curse of a sequel
","********Spoilers Warning******* Is it worth the wait? Yes for me, and if nothing else, just for seeing Depp reprising his role as Captain Jack Sparrow. It was a raucous, fun ride as I expected. The CGI is incredible. It's action packed. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann mature a little bit this time around. And good ol' Jack, one of the most loved pirates in movie history, is as sleazy and funny as ever and always scheming up something. However, this time he's also slightly out of his elements, and not quite sure what he wants. Maybe in the 3rd movie, we will get to know why. Devy Jones might be just the most impressive villain coming out of the movies in the last few years. The ending, with Jack returning to his fearless self and walking into the mouth of Kraken and the return of Barbossa, is absolutely jaw dropping.<br/><br/>That said, I walked out of the theater feeling entertained but slightly disappointed. There are too many actions and not enough Jack Sparrow, too many plots and not enough building up of the characters. The film makers are so eager to make sure that this is going to the biggest and the most spectacular ride in Summer and that there will be plenty left for the 3rd installment, they forgot the success of the first POTC is mostly due to unusual and vastly intriguing character(s). Take away Jack Sparrow and there's not much left to watch (OK, there's still Barbossa). Here not only that we have only bits and pieces of Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth suddenly becomes attracted to Jack, Bootstrap Bill came back from nowhere, and seemly dozens of new characters show up with very little background and introduction. They all seem to be lost in the non-stop actions and a very complicated plot.<br/><br/>Hopefully everything will fall into place in the final movie. I will definitely see the movie the 1st open weekend. And Disney better not ruins it for me the magic and the enjoyment that came with the 1st one."

","This movie reminded me of King Kong and of Lord of the Rings. My son and I started telling each other which scenes we were reminded of in these movies - from the aerial view of the island (King Kong) to the style of sword fighting (Eowyn in the final battle) to everyone running from the 'natives' who wanted to eat Depp (King Kong)- it was so derivative.... And pointless. The scene on the island with the cannibals went on much too long and added little. <br/><br/>There was not enough Depp, not enough humor, not enough story. Who wants to see tentacles moving this way and that? Whoopee. CGI should be to enhance a movie, not be the point of the movie. <br/><br/>What a let down.

","I'd had my doubts about Dead Man's Chest when I first heard it even existed: ""Why do they need another Pirates?"" I thought. ""The first one really didn't need a sequel."" But then I read reviews, heard how great it was, read that it got a 3.5 out of 4 stars from critics and that it was actually better than the first. So I thought it might be worth seeing and that maybe, just MAYBE, a director had done a good job on a sequel for the first time in forever.<br/><br/>...Yeah, I should've stuck with my first impression. Not that the movie was BAD, per se: I've definitely seen worse. But I strongly, strongly suggest not spending 9-something dollars to see it in theaters. It was not worth it. (This is most likely my cue to get clubbed to death by hardcore PotC fans).<br/><br/>Okay. You'd think that any movie that's 2.5 hours long would logically have at least a decent plot to keep it moving along for that long, right? Um, WRONG. This was a total crap plot. It moved way too fast: the beginning made no sense, and after the umpteenth time I got lost, I just gave up trying altogether.<br/><br/>They tried way too hard to smoosh ten thousand unrelated things into one movie. Somebody was obviously running out of ideas for this movie, because some things were incredibly random, unexplained, &/or idiotic (...i.e., the whole Elizabeth/Jack thing - totally random. ...I think that might've been what really ruined it for me).<br/><br/>And the ending? Was worse than the ending for Cujo, and that's saying something. Cliffhangers I can deal with. Starting a new (nonexistent) plot at the very end; bringing back a character who was KILLED IN THE PREVIOUS MOVIE?; and then immediately running the end credits to leave you waiting, dazed and confused, for several more years until they can make a third movie... is completely RIDICULOUS.<br/><br/>Redeeming qualities? Well, at least the special effects were excellent. ... ... ... That's about it. Save your money."
"DICK STEEL","8","2","4","11 July 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","It was peculiar, but it might be signs of things to come. When I entered the theatre this evening for the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest gala premiere today at Cathay, on screen was this static frame of the PoTC logo, with the words: ""Singapore, Home of Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, May 2007"". If I may read too much into it, does it mean that there will be no effort spared in having the World Gala of PoTC3 right here on our shores, since Singapore was mentioned in both PoTC1 and PoTC2? And with Chow Yun-Fatt's wife being from here, does it mean we got an additional boost? One can only dream, but you heard it here first.<br/><br/>Anyway, our favourite characters from the high seas are back! From perennial favourite Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow, to fan girl groupie idol Orlando Bloom as Will Turner, it's no wonder why the movie has sailed its way comfortably into the record books for the highest grossing opening weekend. Familiar elements that made the first movie a success are continued here to ensure the sequel's appeal and probably longevity in holding high box office spots in weeks to come.<br/><br/>While I shall avoid the specifics of the plot, it meanders around the title's Dead Man's Chest, a box containing an artefact so powerful, that everyone, ranging from our pirates, to new villain Davy Jones, to the British East India Company, are actively seeking so as to rule the seven seas. The usual lead characters are back, with an expanded cast made up by some supporting characters from the first movie, and new ones developed, especially the villains.<br/><br/>But bugger, a big budgeted crowd pleasing summer popcorn flick comes with certain flaws though, but easily overlooked and forgiven. The plot doesn't seem to stand still, and there are many subplots thrown all over, no doubt made complicated by Jack Sparrow's seemingly scheming ideas. The first half, widely used in the trailers, seemed to drag on forever with slapstick comedy included which lost steam halfway through. Not to mention with plot holes so big you wonder how certain characters can actually survive.<br/><br/>The sets still looked as spectacular, though already tinged with a sense of familiarity. Jack Sparrow's Black Pearl now has been overshadowed by Davy Jones' Flying Dutchman, which is an awesome eery looking ship that comes with submerging properties. There are plenty of special effects and makeup done, and Sparrow's and Barbossa's jolly crew from the first are now given the one-up by Jones' merman sea-creature like pirates. Even Jones' himself consisted of medusa-like squid tentacles on his squishy wet face, and has a humongous crab claw for a hand.<br/><br/>The usual comedic elements are not forgotten, but somehow lacked as much fun and punch which audiences experienced in the original. It's one of those you-know-it's-suppose-to-be-funny-but-why-aren't-I-laughing-out-loud moments. The action sequences are also bigger and louder, but that made it a tad overdrawn at certain times. Though visually pleasing, it's as if the sequences had to justify the many cool special effects shots and stunts designed for the movie, and so had to extend its runtime for that purpose.<br/><br/>The clincher for this movie is perhaps the characterization and relationships. It reminded the audience of several character motivations, and provided new ones as well. Unexpected character changes and shifts will make you go ""Hmm!"" and provide additional fuel to power the trilogy into its final film.<br/><br/>This movie, being the second part of the trilogy, suffered from being the ""bridging"" tale. While it has some kind of a standalone story, it's still part of a bigger picture not fully explained in itself. I likened the movie to being the equivalent of the Matrix Reloaded in the Wachowski Bros' Matrix Trilogy, with plenty of ideas, characters, sub plots, character shifts thrown into the mix, in a plot that goes around, before hanging with a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>***** SPOILERS START ***** Come to think of it, it's gonna be much like the Revolution's (and even Star War's Return of the Jedi) first act, where our heroes have to seek out and redeem their charismatic messiah.<br/><br/>***** SPOILERS END ***** So ahoy mates! It's nonetheless a stormy ride, but one which will lead us to anticipate the story to sail over to the Orient, passing through Singapore (finally get to see exactly what Jack's been boasting about all this while), and meeting up with their Asian counterparts. It's gonna be one heck of a multi-way fight at world's end! And oh, stay tuned until after the end credits for a small scene, but one which probably doesn't contain any clues, or directly influencing the final movie."

","Okay. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is fun. Lots of fun.<br/><br/>It's a long movie. At least 2 hours. It feels long but it doesn't drag. This is the main difference between this Pirates movie and the last one, The Curse of the Black Pearl. Black Pearl was becalmed in the waters of excitement by the end; Dead Man's Chest does whatever the opposite sailing analogy of 'becalmed' is.<br/><br/>It is a British movie. The cast is lots of fun and all the supporting players are talented. British actors everywhere. One actor who is not British is Stellan Skarsgård. He is superb. He's always superb, he's a great actor. Jack Davenport brings the humour and coolness that Coupling fans expect. Orlando Bloom is less underwhelming than in his last Pirates appearance. This seems to be partly from being given less dialogue and partly from improvement in his acting. Keira Knightley is also good.<br/><br/>The two main actors are Johnny Depp and Bill Nighy. Depp had everyone in the theatre laughing and Nighy is so good as the voice of (and presumably the CGI model for) Davy Jones that he isn't recognisable. Davy Jones is all you see and he seems very alive and convincing.<br/><br/>Speaking of Davy Jones, the special effects in this movie are good. They are not completely realistic but they are less comical and obvious than the effects in the last Pirates movie, even when the effects are trying to be comical and obvious.<br/><br/>The music is clichéd and stale but it would be weird to have genuinely moving music in such a silly movie.<br/><br/>The movie is absurd.

"Jenfeng","2","2","4","10 July 2006"," A Complete Waste of Time
","Awfully dull and painfully exhausting, PC2 easily tops Superman and mutants as the most disappointing movie of the summer. So many plots are too long for no reason that they become meaningless. The only notable character, Jack, goes from funny in the beginning to boring at the end. The only credit I would give is the special effects. They are magnificent indeed, but they don't save this story from misery. Not at all. All the chasing, explosion, fights, are for only one reason: another sequel. I really have no idea a successful filmmaker can be this irresponsible. Consider this: watching this film, having in mind that they are shooting two sequels at the same time; sounds familiar? Exactly, the matrix sequels. And what happened? The masterpiece first movie goes from a bad second to a worse third. I mean, if they can't make a better sequel, why don't they just leave it alone? Infuriating!!!"
"vegasgirl2225","3","2","4","10 July 2006"," Over The Top Boring
","I just got back from the movie and I was surprised at how weak the plot was. It seemed like less of a plot and more of a stream of consciousness dream sequences that were so loosely thrown together, I found myself not caring about the characters and bored by their excitement in a can approach to film-making. It seems the movie makers figured great special effects and lots of action sequences would cover up the lack of a good script and judging by the good reviews people seem to be giving it here, I guess it worked, you fooled em. It was cookie cutter entertainment ""insert fighting sequence here...insert snotty one liner here...special effects here, blah blah blah"". Entertaining for kids but I found it lacking in substance."
"aschnier-2","5","2","4","10 July 2006"," The Dead man is bloated
","I wanted to like this movie; I really liked the first one. But the screenplay is so bloated and confused that it seems like it was made up as they went along. The first third of the movie is completely unnecessary; the adventures of the crew with a group of natives has nothing at all to do with the overall plot. A visit to a lady that supposedly can help them does not result in any actual information being given to the characters that they don't already know (although the audience don't know all of it, they could have cut those scenes and had an existing character exposition to Will and the audience). The scenes of Elizabeth catching up with the rest of the principles appear to be tacked on just so we wouldn't forget that she's in the movie too.<br/><br/>So while the action sequences and humor are actually pretty good, there is so much dead time between them due to pointless (and at times, contradictory) scenes of melodrama and exposition that they could have probably cut the film down to 90 minutes or so and had a pretty good summer movie. As it stands, it's a bloated 2 1/2 hour mess that actually seems a lot longer than that."

The special effects were pretty good, the movie itself really was good, just not AS good.<br/><br/>The final line written on IMDb is incorrect, its closer to ""What has become of my ship"" spoken by Barbosa referring to the Pearl.<br/><br/>How much do you think Rush got paid for that line and the bite of the apple?

"GaryJByrnes","2","2","4","10 July 2006"," Hugely disappointing - where's the story?
","Okay, Johnny Depp is wonderful, the movie looks good and there are some funny lines. However, I was greatly let down by the apparent absence of story or plot. This over-long film seems to be simply one incident after another, with no real sense of where the characters are going, no real coherence or continuity. A series of events does not a story make. The effects are - surprisingly - a little ropey too, the Kraaken looking less realistic than a live octopus. I was a huge fan of part 1 and really wanted to love this film. It's just a pity that the talented cast wasn't given more juicy lines and their characters more juicy predicaments. My advice to the producers for part 3: get some writers on board!"
"ffmrob","6","2","4","10 July 2006"," Too long - and Jack's doing all he can NOT to be sexy
","There was a lightness and a grace about the first film. This has neither. It is FAR TOO LONG, the plot drags on, the script lacks the humour and wit of the first and the trailered kiss - a big draw for Depp's female fans - is deeply unconvincing. It seems contrived that Jack is now meant to be desirous of Elizabeth, as he clearly wasn't in the first film - despite being on a desert island with her. And it's not that clear why Elizabeth would suddenly find him attractive. Except that since countless women do, so must she, I guess...<br/><br/>Ironically, for all Johnny Depp is much desired, but he doesn't do raw desire with any conviction (not even in The Libertine, though he manages regret and ennui there very well) - too much of a child-man perhaps? When Jack's kiss comes he doesn't convince (and I really wanted him to, believe me), though Keira does pretty well her end. In fact here she acts more effectively than he does. I can see why they had it, of course, but to be brutally honest, Depp's better being a crafty kid - all the positive aspects of a smart, sad or thwarted child he shows to perfection - even the fighting has the air of play acting this time round (better in the first, especially the scene in the blacksmith's). Don't remember Sparrow doing quite so much mincing and flouncing in the first film: he was camp there, but not this camp. But then since this character's been hailed as sexy in the first, I guess, as usual, Depp's trying his best to undermine that impression here, taking every opportunity to look clumsy, unheroic and effete. Against the odds, allowing his looks, he pretty well succeeds.<br/><br/>The other pretty faces are creditable. Keira Knightley, for all she can't really act, tries very hard in her earnest way and is no worse than in the first. Orlando Bloom also tries hard, though is no better than her in the acting stakes and he is less lucky with the script. He is well-served by his 'I'm gorgeous in this light/stance/close-up' moments though - the director knows what the teen audience want to see, here at least.<br/><br/>Nighy is fun, doing an angry, physically powerful man in a manner we rarely see for this actor, though that mouth, which we focus upon thanks to all the tentacles, lacks menace, and looks rather weak. The best performances are those of Will Turner's father, Bootstrap Bill (Stellan Skarsgard) and Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander). Both utterly convince - quite a triumph for the former under a weight of special effects, while the latter is just nasty and you know it, without any props at all.<br/><br/>So to sum up, this long-winded, slithery romp is more for older kids than the last film, and then in desperate need of a more succinct plot, more tightly edited and therefore more effective special effect moments, and a sharper script (though the latter would be lost on children of course - it would just make the hours less wearisome for the adults). Go without kids only if you've the hots for Bloom or Knightley - or you like your man to be reminiscent of a naughty child. But be prepared for a long 150 minutes..."

","There was too much action and not enough Jack Saprrow. Jacks interactions with the 2 solders, his subtle and very funny facial expressions, and some honest to goodness sword fighting in Pirates1, were replaced by high production non-stop action computer effects. Though I thought that all the computer effects (creatures and sea battles) were done VERY well, it didn't lend itself to the Jack Sparrow subtle humor and quirky laughs I came to love in Pirates1. Even the usual Depp slapstick missed the mark 3/4 times. Unfortuneatly, the theater I saw it in had the sound cranked up very high, and found some characters hard to understand. Maybe because I saw my Pirates 1 DVD 34 times and expected too much, even though I adjusted my expectations thinking it was going to be another let down like the Matrix2 sequel with a Matrix 3 on deck, the ending did not make me excited about waiting for Part 3."

"LadyLiberty","5","2","4","9 July 2006"," ""Pirates"" sinks under the weight of its aspirations (mild spoiler)
","In 2003, somebody somewhere decided it would be a good idea to make a movie based on one of the rides at Disneyland. I went on that ride when I was 12. Even then, I thought it was stupid. Needless to say, I wasn't keen on the idea of a movie. I went anyway, and left the theatre with a grin a mile wide. Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all time favorite movies. That's the main reason I dread writing the review for the newly released sequel.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest picks up some months after the end of the previous Pirates movie. Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) are just about to marry when their big day is interrupted by the smug Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander). Beckett chats with Elizabeth's father, Governor Weatherby Swann (Jonathan Price) briefly, and then flourishes an arrest warrant for the couple. It seems that the British authorities haven't taken well the fact that the two helped the notorious pirate and criminal, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape.<br/><br/>Beckett does offer Will a sliver of hope that he and his fiancée might yet live happily ever after. He tells Will that, if he can procure the compass that Captain Sparrow carries, he'll offer the couple a pardon. The Governor, who is the same dithering coward that he was in the first film, seems helpless to intervene. So Will takes the chance and, leaving Elizabeth behind in her jail cell, he leaves to track down the pirate and do whatever must be done to get his hands on the compass.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Captain Sparrow has some troubles of his own. It seems that he became the Captain of the Black Pearl by cutting a deal with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) himself. And now the time has come for Jack to make the agreed upon payment: his very soul. Obviously, he's not keen on this and, with his usual fluttering aplomb, schemes to find a way to back out of the deal. Unfortunately, the only way he can think of involves being able to find both a mysterious key as well as the chest it unlocks.<br/><br/>While Jack looks for the key, Will looks for Jack. And while the Governor looks for a way to free his daughter (and not incidentally get her away from Will of whom he still thoroughly disapproves), Elizabeth finds her own way out of jail and into even more trouble. Her problems are only exacerbated when she runs into the discredited British officer under whose watch Jack escaped. The former Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) harbors more than a little ill will for Jack and Will, but he's also out of options and gets caught up in events despite himself.<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that there's a mysterious witchy woman (Tia Dalma, played by Naomie Harris) who offers up cryptic advice to one and all? Or that Black Pearl crew members Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and MacKenzie Cook) are still unable to get along? Or that Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and his parrot are along for the ride? Or that the long lost Bootstrap Jack (Stellan Skarsgard) shows up? Or that there is an island somewhere in the Caribbean populated by cannibals? Or...<br/><br/>And therein lies the primary problem with Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. There's quite simply much too much packed into the movie which means that nothing gets adequate attention, and that the numerous side stories detract from the plot at best, and confuse things immeasurably for the most part.<br/><br/>There are those critics who think that Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is best taken in small doses. I disagree. Yes, he's still apparently gay, drunk, drugged, or otherwise not quite right, but he's also still as magnetic and lovable a comic villain that ever existed (that he's also drop dead gorgeous despite himself doesn't hurt his cause, either). Orlando Bloom does a pretty good job playing the earnest hero, and his sword fighting is once again just terrific. Keira Knightley is a pretty girl, and one who holds her own with the boys. And Bill Nighy is a shuddery delight to watch, what with his wet and slurpy speech from a face wreathed by writhing tentacles.<br/><br/>The special effects are, as you might expect, very good, but the first movie outshines this second installment in that regard as well. While I still marvel over the skeletons fighting on the ship in the original, I'd just as soon forget a few of the glaringly visible problems with some effects in this film. The sword fights are excellent, including one with some brilliant stuntwork and some special effects merged seamlessly into an exciting whole. But bizarrely, some simple shipboard scenes show obvious green screen work. Some glimpses of a sea monster are as real as can be, but others show the blurriness of composite close-ups.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski is back, and he shows his same able touch in combining action with comedy. The writers of the original penned the script for the sequel as well. That's why I'm at a loss as to why the second film is so lacking. My own opinion is that the writers tried to meet the huge expectations for the follow-up, and in so doing, simply tried too hard and went overboard.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is rated PG-13 for ""intense sequences of adventure violence, including frightening images."" I'd be more concerned about younger kids being able to follow the many needless complications to the story than with the violence (though the littlest ones will doubtless be afraid of the sea monster). Smart ten year-olds should be able to keep up. Meanwhile, you'll likely be able to keep up, too. I just can't promise that you'll want to."
"militaristicnerd","4","2","4","9 July 2006"," Not that great, fairly disappointed
","I was looking forward to this movie quite a bit, having enjoyed the first one immensely and watched it countless times. However, as I left the theater I felt pretty darn let down. The first one had an excellent plot which kept me interested towards the end, mainly because it had a few action sequences that were really good coupled with some excellent dialog that really drew you into the plot. However, it seems as if in Dead Man's Chest, the producers neglected the dialog/plot (which is disappointingly simplistic) and tried to make the movie all action. In all fairness, the special effects during these sequences were absolutely superb (amoung the best I have ever seen), yet they seemed like they were simply a Zorro movie with really good effects. When I say Zorro, I mean that most of the things in the action sequences are just overly contrived (etc. something falls, sets off a chain reaction, and sequence is changed in ways it never could have been in real life). The plot itself, as was mentioned earlier, was somewhat disappointing. The first movie had some of the coolest villains I have ever seen (the skeletons), however, the villains in this movie are not scary but just kinda repulsive, like a ""whats this dead animal doing out here in 100 degree heat"" repulsive. Finally, while the first movie had this air of sickening realization that curses and stuff actually exist, since this is already confirmed even at the start of the first one, the world it takes place in just seems like Neverland in Peter Pan where paranormal stuff is in fact the norm. My advice? See it, but don't let the reputation of the first one sweep you away in this air of ""I don't care about all these details, I want the sequel to be good so I will make sure and bubble on about it to all my friends."" Just take an open mind when you go see it and be accepting of the fact that some sequels do in fact, fall miserably short of the original."
"KarisLOVER","2","2","4","9 July 2006"," Without Johnny, I might have died...
","Remember two years ago when Disney announced that their hit film, Pirates of the Caribbean, would be turned into a trilogy? I said to myself ""This cannot be good."". Guess what? I was right.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest picks up directly where the first Pirates left off. Will and Elizabeth's wedding is cut tragically short, by a pair of arrest warrants baring their names. Will, is then charged with finding our beloved Captain Jack Sparrow, retrieving his compass, and handing it over to a shifty Lord ( a clone of the first Pirate's Commodore Norrington character). Once found, Jack tells Will he will give him the compass, but only if he finds a key for him. Jack, on the other hand, owes Davy Jones a soul. So, being a pirate, he's effectively screwing everybody else, to wiggle his way out of being in Davy Jones' debt. Then Elizabeth breaks free of prison (of course) and proceeds to help Will and Jack. If you ask me, and I'm assuming you are since you're reading my review, the plot sounds like a treasure hunt concocted for a six year old. You know, the ones where this map points you to this key, which unlocks this chest, which has another chest inside it Even worse, however, are the stupid subplots we are asked to endure.<br/><br/>While there's dozens of reasons Dead Man's Chest doesn't work, here's the main one: It should never have been made. Listen up, Disney; when you hit the jackpot, and make an amazing movie based on a theme park ride, play it safe and leave it there. Don't insist on whoring it out and creating a trilogy. Any scene without Johnny Depp (who remains Oscar worthy), is pure drivel. The entire film suffers from bad supporting actors, awful design choices, and a plot unworthy of Saturday morning cartoons. Curse of the Black Pearl was near perfect. It struck the right balance between humor, action, and plot. But in Dead Man's Chest, they are all out of whack. Badly.<br/><br/>On to the acting shoot me now. Everyone, excluding Johnny, is terrible. Orlando Bloom continues to prove that he is nothing more than Legolas without the wig. And sadly, at least half the movie is placed upon his shoulders for him to carry; at which he fails. Keira, what happened? You had been doing so great. And even got an Oscar nomination for God's sake. But now, you're wooden and unfeeling. You make us come away cold. I'll ask again, what happened? I understand that playing an entirely CG character isn't an easy task, but Bill Nighy as Davy Jones gave me convulsions. Think of everything an actor shouldn't do in a role, and he probably did it. And the French-ish accent? God I'm literally stunned at how bad this performance was. But amidst all the terror, we have a shining star. Johnny Depp, who reprises his role as the Keith Richards-inspired Jack Sparrow, is brilliant beyond words. Complete with a drunken swagger, and more eyeliner than all of Green Day put together, he's simply a wonder to watch. Every expression is pure gold. There's just something I cannot put my finger on that makes Johnny Depp so incredible. Now, that's not to say every scene with him is perfect. The screenwriters make his character take a turn that is contrary to everything Depp had placed into the role. It effectively neuters his character, but it's hardly Depp's fault. He still remains Oscar worthy as ever.<br/><br/>But the real problem arises when Davy Jones appears. His character is so bad, he cancels out everything Jack Sparrow adds to Pirates of the Caribbean. And to anyone who has watched the first, they know that is everything. So what are we left with once Sparrow and Jones are gone? A horrible movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie had me wishing it was over during the opening scene. I won't fail it, simply because Johnny Depp is so incredible, but know that without him, it wouldn't have lasted five seconds. It's scary that Gore Verbinski can go from such extremes of good (Curse of the Black Pearl, The Ring) and bad (Dead Man's Chest). But frankly, I would have drowned myself in popcorn butter if Johnny Depp had not been in this movie."

Anyone can enjoy a film with a great storyline and no effects than vice versa, its human nature. So human nature therefore dictates that this film was a huge letdown.<br/><br/>The first film combined the two elements pretty well though not splendidly but this film was way too complicated to follow. Far too many subplots with some being totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>It really dragged on this film to a point where I just wanted to walk out. It really was that painful.

","I was really looking forward to this one. The first POTC was one of the most enjoyable movies released in 2003, and Johnny Depp just owns the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. Naturally, I was looking forward to a lot of the same things that were very entertaining the first time around today....with the added bonus of furthering the story and providing a little more insight into the world of the Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>What do I think now that I've seen it? Its somewhat unremarkable, underwhelming, and didn't really meet my expectations.<br/><br/>Although this movie is visually stunning, I couldn't help but wonder if it really needed all the bells and whistles that they threw at it. Davy Jones and his crew were somewhat distracting, and I think would have been just as effective as a supernatural crew of pirates without all the CGI.<br/><br/>The story was scattered, but OK. We all know that there is a third film coming soon, so it didn't really feel like a complete film (Not to mention that knowing who is signed on for the next one kinda ruins some of the tense parts of this film). I think that this was really due to most of the characters having their own agenda in the storyline. (You kinda have to pay attention to this) <br/><br/>Some of the best parts of the first film are still here: Captain Jack Sparrow (Which Johnny Depp still owns), some humour and cool sword fights. This does make it a fun movie, but it is by no means a must see. I could have waited for a rental."

With full understanding that the making of a sequel of equal or greater entertainment is a tremendous undertaking, I feel quite a bit let down. POTC Dead Man's Chest felt more like the special effects team was ordered to receive an Oscar ""or else"" and that much of the actual acting portion of the movie was lost to that order. While my family and I were watching the stories being played out by our beloved characters (both good and evil) we were thoroughly entertained. Too bad there was not enough of that in this sequel. We can only hope that the next time we see Captain Jack, Elizabeth, Will and the rest of our heroes, they will be allowed to do the acting and the special effects team can have some time off."
"paulm143","6","2","4","9 July 2006"," Verbinski loses the fun plot. Still a good ride, but not a great one.
","One gets the impression from ""Dead Man's Chest"" that Gore Verbinski either lost the fun parts of the script from the last half of this movie, or that he reviewed the script from the forthcoming third movie and realized there was too much left in the fx budget and not enough juice left in the script. So wide was the disparity between fx and writing that he seemed to need to spread one thickly and one far too thinly.<br/><br/>The movie rambles along nicely enough for the first hour and 20 minutes, very much in the vein of the first, tightly directed, plot well built, some decent jokes and neat ""in"" jokes to keep fans intrigued. What follows though is comparatively very dark.<br/><br/>Without entering into the arena of spoilerdom; the plot line goes off on an elongated wander apparently intended to ignite interest in the third installment, but actually in serious danger of extinguishing interest. We see some very tired devices attempting to twist the plot, but in truth far more suited to a bad episode of ""Dallas"" or ""Dynasty"". Sexual intrigue which isn't intriguing, wholly unbelievable character reversal and re-reversals, the re-introduction of an unnecessary character and a lame attempt to draw on the audience's emotions by the elimination of another.<br/><br/>Verbinski also seems unduly obsessed by the use of paranormal characters to add wow. He fails almost completely. What actually occurs is that we become almost ""effects weary"" by the continued use of jaded devices which are not original the first time they appear in this movie, never mind that they are rolled out time and time again. It feels like one is being beaten over the head with them. The first movie benefited greatly from the occasional displays of the ""curse"". No such subtlety exists here.<br/><br/>Taken in isolation, this movie could be pronounced an entertaining spectacle, but perhaps Disney has created a rod for their back by attempting to recreate the magic and the excellence of the first twice more.<br/><br/>This story cannot stand by itself, much as the second Matrix was a meaningless ramble without the third. That series remains a flawed tale, we can only hope that Pirates finds it's touch on the third outing. After such an excellent start it would be a dreadful waste of excellent talent for if the third were nearly as unsatisfying as this disappointing follow-up."

Jack Sparrow is quite a letdown, if not sort of a villain when it comes to Will Turner and at times, Elizabeth Swan. Be prepared for a few scary moments, and lots of laughter, perhaps even a few tears for you sensitive souls. If you liked the first movie, you will love this one. Even if you didn't really like the first movie, this is a perfect flick for anyone. Some of it is a tad scary, but no so much that you couldn't take your kid to see it.

","I went in to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2 with the utmost excitement. I loved the first movie, with its hilarious lines and fun action sequences, so I expected the second movie to deliver this same integrity. However, I was completely disappointed with this movie. Take the first movie, subtract all the funny lines, add a couple fight scenes that defy all the rules of gravity, add many pointless tangents off the plot, and you get the second movie. On its own, Pirates 2 would be an average movie, but compared to the original, it is an utter let-down. The overall plot is interesting, but it is presented in a way that is random and scattered. The characters all behave in a way outside their characters in a corny, not good, way. There are no memorable lines, instead almost all the jokes are based on things said in the first movie (for example, Will as a eunich.) All in all, this movie was far from the first, lacking in the entertainment and wit provided by the original."

","Pirates  OK, first the disclaimer. The first Pirates replaced Superman the Movie as my favorite movie of all time. I loved the script, the banter, the clever lines, the cinematography, everything. It was a perfect movie. So this Pirates had a huge uphill battle and it failed pretty convincingly.<br/><br/>So what made Jack Sparrow such an interesting character in the first movie? After all he was a ""bad guy"", a pirate; yet we rooted for him. Will Turner summed it up when he proclaims Jack as a ""good man"" (what Jack called Will's father, Bootstrap). In the first movie Jack risks everything to save Elizabeth. He rescues Will. So he is worthy of redemption at the end, and that's why we root for him. In the new movie Jack is much more the scoundrel and less the hero. That is a HUGE error. How can we root for a villain? The first movie was so beautifully choreographed. Dark scene (literally  night), then bright scene and back and forth. New movie  mostly Dark Scenes. First movie had many great lines. Second time Jack shows up in front of Barbosa and Barbosa exclaims ""impossible"". Jack corrects him with ""improbable"". Just an example of a terrific line. Very few of these in the new movie. Will and Elizabeth were very good in the new movie.<br/><br/>Music was great, special effects were excellent although some were hard to see in the darkness.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 6 but then add a point because is is a MUST SEE movie. Afterall, it is the highest (by far) single day grossing movie of all time.<br/><br/>So the movie gets a 7."

","I felt the main characters were over shadowed by the Davey Jones characters. Did not like it as much as the first one. I felt that the main characters had roles that seemed not as first rate as the first Pirates. Some of the dialog was hard to understand. Especially the woman in the shack that gave Jack the jar of dirt. Not sure what here role was in this movie. What was the significants in the mark on Jacks hand? If Jack needed the key to right the wrong, why did he not let Will Turner put the key in the box and get out the heart. Too many things in this movie that did not make it clear what the plot was from the beginning. How did Jack get in the prison? Where did he get the map?"

","The film got to two hours in and I was wondering if it was ever going to finish, especially as by that point I couldn't see it wrapping up anytime soon. Turns out it had no intention of doing so as the ending makes it necessary to see the third instalment as we have bee left with half a story.<br/><br/>An hour could easily have been cut out of this film without losing anything of value.<br/><br/>It was a good enough yarn but not a patch on the third.<br/><br/>The best thing about this film is Johnny Depp, the best thing by a country mile.<br/><br/>Keira Knightly is well...I suppose the best word is irritating. She gets cast as the same kind of character in almost every film she's done and mostly the same emotion is in play throughout - ""I want to save my man/football career/own ass if it's the last thing I do"".<br/><br/>All in all it's a good enough film but a lot of boring stuff in between the good action.<br/><br/>Hope the third one is an improvement."

","A great film, more enjoyable then the first as it has Johnny Depp being thoroughly more camp and wacky then before. While I did enjoy the first movie, I wasn't a huge fan by any means. I guess it all just seemed a bit to contrived and lacking that great entertainment value which I was led to expect before seeing it. On the other hand I could tell that part was going to be pure entertainment merely from the trailers alone and I wasn't wrong. Depp is brilliant as Jack Sparrow and both Orlando and Keira were great to boot, not to mention a very good support cast which helped this shine ever more. This is simply a great fun flick that will leave you with that taste of wanting more. Loved it heaps."

","The original movie worked very hard to stay light hearted and fun. It succeeded beyond expectation as most fans can attest. Ignore the Cannes Film Festival reviewers here - they have that jaded, smarter than you halo over their burned out, hollow lives.<br/><br/>Here's what you should know: It's more serious, but, still a summer movie in that it is filled with fantasy, magic, over the top action, and humor.<br/><br/>It's darker and has more scenes of death - important to know if you are taking the kids.<br/><br/>Even though it is 2.5 hours long (which I prefer as a minimum length to learn anything) there is still so much detail you have to pay attention or you will get confused or miss an important detail. Some previous reviewers obviously missed details and hence their confusion over some parts of the film.<br/><br/>Expect to see sides of all the characters you have not seen before.<br/><br/>DO NOT DRINK A JUMBO DRINK OR YOU WILL BE SORRY! <br/><br/>Stay until the end of the credits!<br/><br/>ENJOY!"

And guess what. It was more than worth it! The CGI looked fabulous. Great action sequences but the dialogue could have been a bit better as this film was a bit confusing but I got it just.<br/><br/>The film was also very very funny with Captain Jack Sparrow's great humour once again appearing.<br/><br/>I would suggest that you watch Curse of the Black Pearl before watching this or watch Curse of the Back Pearl again before watching this to understand some of the jokes.<br/><br/>So I gave this a 10/10 as that is what it deserved."

","Dudes the movie was definitely AMAZING and all that but why must it have a cliffhanger? That has got to be the worst cliff hanger EVER! Seriously... and that kiss... it DIDN'T even need to be there. NO ONE should be allowed to kiss/pash Jack Sparrow! Keira Knightley is so damn lucky. I mean all she had to do was beg the directors for the kiss/pash with Captain Jack Sparrow. Do we have that type of privilege? As if having Mr Darcy wasn't enough. Anyway i believe the kiss/pash was pretty much uncalled for. Keira was great as was Johnny Depp (obviously) and Orlando didn't surprise us at ALL with HIS AMAZING acting skills (note the sarcasm.) It's so sad because there's Keira and Johnny Depp fully acting amazingly and then there's... Orlando with his stoned expression which pretty much didn't change throughout the movie. But i can say that Orlando has improved and now shows more emotion than he ever has before so we should all CHEER!!!! YAY! Anyways i REALLY think that the cliffhanger ending was uncalled for but besides that the movie was AMAZING and HILARIOUS! ""ELizabeth?"" Captain Jack turns 'Quick hide the rum!"" =P"
"ghostspyke","10","2","4","8 July 2006"," One of the Best Sequels We Could Hope For
","This movie was excellent from ALMOST start to finish. The only thing that is difficult is the beginning of the movie. The beginning seemed like it took a long time to get things rolling, but once they did get movin' it was all unstoppable. The plot was pretty strong, and the acting was stellar. Depp's performance, as always, was great and Knightly did a wonderful job as well. Surprisingly it seemed like Orlando Bloom had one of the weaker performances in the movie, but it was still good nonetheless. The computer effects for Davy Jones and his crew were absolutely outstanding! Most interestingly was the frequent appearances of movie sets from the first Pirates of the Caribbean that was really present to show some good laughs. The comedy was not nearly as strong as the first Pirates of the Caribbean (i.e. Johnny Depp sailing a sinking ship into the docks in the first Pirates) This movie really showed off the pirate world and its inner workings. I really enjoyed the extensive shots in Singapore, but what i enjoyed most was the entrance of characters. There was always a clever way to bring in new characters and either crack a joke, or just make you amazed at the level of coolness, heh. <br/><br/>Now the ending to this movie was wonderful in my opinion. I won't ruin anything, but I will say that I think they ended it the best way they could. Many will disagree with me here but I suppose that's to be expected in every movie discussion. I'm really trying to avoid giving anything away so I do apologize for being vague. Just go to this movie and don't be afraid of anything, just be relaxed and ready for one of the best movies this year. If you can't remember a lot of things from the first movie, watch the first movie again so that you're ready for a lot of the inside jokes and such. Also, a very short scene after the credits. I hope you all enjoy this movie as much as I did!!"
"MovieManMenzel","7","2","4","8 July 2006"," ""Dead Man's Chest"" starts out great but somewhere near the end it loses steam and becomes ultimately disappointing.
","In the sequel to the 2003 hit, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny ""The Man"" Depp) is being haunted by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), a ghost pirate who wants Jack's soul unless Jack can get him 100 souls in exchange for his own. To make matters worse both Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) must join Jack's voyage in order to steal Jack's compass for Commodore Norrington in exchange for their lives. A decent however disappointing sequel ensues <br/><br/>Right off the bat, I am going to state that I am a huge fan of Johnny Depp. He is my favorite actor and I think he is great at every role he plays. I also really enjoyed the first Pirates of the Caribbean film which was a great and unique summer blockbuster that I personally own on DVD. With that being said, I have been looking forward to ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" for many months now and when I finally saw it on opening day, I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>Its hard to say what went wrong with ""Dead Man's Chest"" because I have talked to several people about the film before writing this review including my girlfriend and some of my friends at work and no one hated the film, but just felt disappointed by it. From what I gathered people found this movie disappointing for two reasons which I will address as my review continues below.<br/><br/>Personally, I found the first 2/3 of the film to be every bit as good as the original film however when the film begins to show Davy Jones as a major threat, is where I feel the film goes down hill. The problem with the film at this point is that it begins to go special effects happy and shows this huge battle involving an octopus and every person who I asked about the film said this scene never seemed to end. The scene in my opinion reminded me a lot of the 3rd Matrix film, ""Matrix Revolutions"" which as we all know wasn't as good as we hoped. The scene I am referring to is the battle of Zion in ""Matrix Revolutions"" because that scene never seemed to end and neither did the scene in ""Dead Man's Chest"" where Jack Sparrow and the gang were battling the octopus. This is the first main problem and if this scene was cut down to say 10 minutes it would have worked quite well however it was overlong and became repetitive and boring.<br/><br/>The second problem is the ending which basically without giving anything away leaves the audience unsatisfied and makes the entire second film seem like a marketing scheme in order to see the 3rd film. Personally even though the ending upset me to no end and left me wanting more, I know for a fact I will be in the theater when the 3rd one opens next year because I am curious to find out what happens. But this may not work for anyone because when everyone saw the 2nd Matrix film and was disappointed, the 3rd one was very poorly attended at the theater. I hope this doesn't happen with Pirates like it did with the Matrix but who knows. All the director Gore Verbinski had to do was create an ending that didn't seem like a tie-in ending and he could have literally made millions happy.<br/><br/>Other then those two things I really can't say there was anything else wrong with the film. I still loved Captain Jack Sparrow and as I previously stated I thought that most of the film was great up until the last 40 minutes or so which just seemed so drawn out and repetitive. Seeing the fact that I really loved the first film and I am a big fan of Johnny Depp I was expecting a great sequel and although the sequel wasn't horrible or unwatchable by any means, it just didn't live up to the greatness of the first film. The first film is probably a solid 8 out of 10 maybe a 9 if you want to give it credit for being a solid summer blockbuster however ""Dead Man's Chest"" is a very weak 7 because the film just seems to never end and when it does end it just leaves the audience feeling cheated.<br/><br/>I will recommend this film because I think it was a decent sequel however be forewarned that it does not live up to the hype nor the first film. I am crossing my fingers for the 3rd one and hoping that the final installment will be outstanding and blow the other two films out of the water (no pun intended). Go see ""Dead Man's Chest"" for Capitan Jack because he is still without a doubt the best part of the film and is part of all the best scenes in this decent however disappointing sequel.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is a 7 out of 10."
"colonel_green","10","2","4","8 July 2006"," What can be said except for ""awesome""?
","As a prologue, I'll say that the showing of Pirates of the Caribbean 2 that I attended helped remind me why I love going to the theatre while others wait for the DVD. My enjoyment of a movie is heightened when seeing it with a good audience watching as well, and that was one of the best audience experiences I've ever had. You could just feel everyone's enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>In other words: awesome.<br/><br/>While it's fun to see Jack and Elizabeth flirt it up a bit, I can't see it going anywhere. Will's too nice a guy to not get the girl in a Hollywood motion picture, even one with a subversive streak.<br/><br/>I don't want to start off a wave of Lucas-bashing, but watching the Pirates franchise just shows what he forgot when making the prequel trilogy. Expertly-blending cutting edge effects with real flesh, blood, and scenery, and an expert mix of action, drama, and comedy. The effects don't overwhelm the story, and the story is centered on three actors perfectly cast as the leads (whatever I think of Bloom's talent, he's good as Will, your standard bland, upstanding guy) I think, unless something really stunning appears, this film has the best FX Oscar locked up.<br/><br/>I also love that in writing the sequels the production team didn't lose sight of all the little minor characters from the first film: we had Mr. Gibbs (an especially good supporting character), Cotton and his parrot, the dwarf guy, a cameo by the two old girlfriends of Jack at Tortuga, Governor Swann, and Norrington (who gets an especially fitting character arc).<br/><br/>And, of course, Pintel and Ragetti, the R2D2 and C3PO of this franchise.<br/><br/>I was also amused to see Tom Hollander and Keira Knightley get a few scenes together, reunited from their roles as another Lizzie and Mr. Collins; there really are only about twenty working British actors.<br/><br/>The end, with the return of our good friend, had the whole audience cheering.<br/><br/>My favourite scene has to be the showdown on the island, with about six different parties fighting for control of the chest; the whole thing is just one joke building on another, with some the finest scoring around (the Pirates main theme is an instant classic), and a bunch of stuff right out of Super Mario Brothers.<br/><br/>10/10, just because, after six straight days of working 7/8 hours, I needed such a jolt of fun. Bring on number three!"

Excellent in every way. Very good actors chosen for the parts as well. I am also proud to say that i am completely obbssesed with the movie. I was sad to hear that the ride was being renewed and modified to tie more with the movie but i guess it needs to catch up with the time frame. Oh well.

","I had a feeling from the moment I saw the full trailer that PotC: DMC was going to be incredible, so I went in with very high hopes (and very excited to boot), and I was not disappointed. It had more of everything I loved in the first one, with stunning scene after stunning scene for my eyes to feast on. I seriously felt like I was in Heaven. The acting is at the same level as the first one (with another great performance by Depp, naturally) which suits me just fine since I can accept that Bloom isn't the greatest actor in the world, but it wasn't the worst performance in history so it's easily overlooked. This soared to such great heights that I'm seriously wondering how they can top it for the third movie, At World's End. I mean, how can you get more swashbuckling action, stellar visuals, and great performances into 2 and 1/2 hours? If you're a fan of the first film, you won't be disappointed, it's all the greatness of CotBP and more. Out of XMen 3 and Superman Returns, Pirates is my favorite movie of the summer (and I seriously loved XMen and Superman, too). Next summer can't get here fast enough. 10/10"

","It is better to watch the first movie before going in to see the second one. My friend had a little trouble understanding how the characters fit with each other. Now for the movie, the special effects are special. They are so perfect and realistic that while watching the movie, you wont even know that you are watching a special effects scene. Even though the movie was not what I expected, it was fantastic in a different way. Secrets uncovered and unexpected appearances are what made me say ""HOLY S**T"" during the movie. You should go to see the movie no matter even if you are not a fan of PIRATE movies. Fight and rum are all what the pirates are concerned about. Isn't it ??"
"MiaBlythe","10","2","4","8 July 2006"," Wonderfully entertaining
","I just saw Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest just a few hours ago and it was a pleasure to sit and watch.<br/><br/>The first movie was wonderful (and one of my most watched DVDs) and the sequel lived up to the first. It manages to beat the 'curse' (pun intended) of sequels .<br/><br/>The plot is brilliant, the acting is superb. Johnny Depp is sexy and perfect as usual as Jack Sparrow, and is the heart and soul of the movie. Orlando Bloom finds his 'sea legs' in this installment and proves that he is a wonderfully talented actor. I've always liked Bloom, he has so much talent and in PotC:DMC he finally taps into that talent. Kiera Knightly takes charge and is funny and witty despite being sun burned for the majority of the movie. Surprisingly though, Jack Davenport - who I was ecstatic to see returning as Commador Norrington- did a fabulous job serving as both comedic ally and foe. Plus, he is really quite handsome without that silly wig on. The expansive supporting cast does an excellent job too and I was pleased to see so many characters from the original return.<br/><br/>The film looks like it used every penny of its multi-million dollar budget. The costumes, makeup, sets, and CGI are flawless.<br/><br/>Davy Jones and his crew are extremely creepy and may scare children. Along those same lines, there are numerous scenes of violence that I am surprised passed the ratings board, so be wary if taking young children.<br/><br/>A wonderful movie full of laughs, tears, amazing action sequences, and endearing characters. I strongly recommend it and I plan on seeing it again.<br/><br/>Also, stay after the credits for an added bonus."
"starrchase26","10","2","4","8 July 2006"," Awesome Movie!
","This movie is just as great as the first one! Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly are just as entertaining as the first one, and give great performances. The scenes are beautiful and eye-catching. The storyline is very interesting and keeps you guessing about what's going to happen next. There are plenty of surprises and a few truly shocking moments. It's a little darker than the first movie, but not too bad if you have small kiddies. There are a couple of parts that will make you jump in your seat though. There are some really cool returning characters as well as some really cool new ones. All in all, I totally loved this movie! It's a movie that the entire family can enjoy. I'll definitely be buying it when it comes out on DVD!"

","I went to this movie because a friend told me that he had bought a ticket for me for the midnight showing. So I go at midnight an hour early, and anticipate a great movie since I thoroughly enjoyed the first. <br/><br/>I was confused through the whole movie. I couldn't tell what was going on, and what character's motivations were for the things they did. The CGI was good, admittedly. The main ""boss"" was a stunning compilation of squid tentacles... although I'm not sure why. This was just one of many things never really explained. I got sick of Jack's antics and people in the theater cheering for everything he did. Stuff lagged on way too long.<br/><br/>I recommend seeing the first one before going. It will explain a lot to you for future references during the second one.<br/><br/>I also felt cheated at the end when I realized this is only a half of a movie."

","After seeing all the trailers for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, I was so excited to see the Pirates sequel, as I absolutely loved the first one. However, I felt that the sequel was way over-the-top, I found that a few story lines were left unresolved or unexplained, and I thought the plot, overall, was not very interesting or exciting. Dead Man's Chest does not do the original Pirates of the Caribbean any justice whatsoever. Johnny Depp was still quite good as Captain Jack Sparrow, but the film as a whole just did not have the same appeal and excitement that the first one had. All in all, I was extremely disappointed with this film."

Unfortunately all of us ended up disappointed. It was just not the show the first one was. You could tell that a bunch of studio execs ran around after the first one made so much $$$$ yelling we have to have a sequel and FAST. The plot is strange but not in a good way. It is choppy and worst of all it Drags......Drags.....Drags. There is a scene with some head hunters that is funny but it just goes on too long to the point where you want to say OK how is this going to end already. There are others like that as well. Another thing I think is important to say is DO NOT bring young children to see this movie. It may be Disney but it's PG13 for good reason. Right from the start where you see crows picking at the eyes and skin of prisoners in cages to the sea-monster attacking the ship it is very frightening for children. I myself, and I'm far from a kid, jumped back in my seat several times. On the way out of the theater I heard a child of about 6-8years old tell her mother, ""I'm going to have dreams tonight that will make me wake up screaming."" The mom laughed thinking she was being cute but the girl said seriously, ""No mom, I really mean it!"" There were fun parts, don't get me wrong. Johnny Depp was wonderful as always I just don't think he was given the best script or direction to show off his Jack Sparrow to the fullest."

"Frollo2","10","2","4","8 July 2006"," Sequel better than original?
","Rarely does a sequel surpass the original... But Dead Man's Chest manages just that... From start to finish this is nothing short of breathtaking... All the characters that we've come to love from the original make a welcome appearance too with a few new additions - this most notably being Bill Nighy's outstanding and scene stealing take on the legendary Davy Jones.<br/><br/>Jonathan Pryce also has more screen time I feel which is a huge plus to me (he's my favourite actor) and brings more depth to the character than we had previously seen.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom does a so-so performance as Will Turner - the sort of performance that we come to expect from him. Nothing spectacular but good nonetheless.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley as Elizabeth is a sensational turn - and how the character has progressed! Simply amazing! But it has to be Johnny Depp who steals the entire film with the return of lovable rogue, Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>The music is also a step up from the predecessor and helps to add to the tensions, trials and tribulations facing the Black Pearl crew. At times even being literal edge of the seat moments - none more than the appearance of the mythical Krakken - Davy Jones's hit-man.<br/><br/>In short I can't think of a possible bad thing to say about this film - I loved it from start to finish!

","I went to the midnight showing excited and hopeful that this would be a good movie. My expectations were met, and more, in places. The effects are incredible, the sword fights are intense, and it just is an all-around fun summer flick. The main problem, I think, is with the plot. I had to look at the little kids book to get the main idea of it, and I still have to look at it to know who is going where, and who has what, etc, etc, etc. (This is why I gave it an 8) Still, I think it's a teensy-weensy better than the first, even though the first has a better plot. It kept me interested and excited through the 2 and a half hours, while the first left me bored in some places. The humor has been hyped up a lot, which made the film, for me, much more enjoyable. The score is about the same as the first film. But the cinematography is stunning, and the shots are incredible. The acting, well, about the same as the first. Depp is excellent as always, while the rest are satisfactory. Not great, but definitely not bad. I had a wonderful time seeing this film, and wanted to cheer and give a standing ovation, but didn't since this audience was a lousy one and just left the theater. But I digress. I heartily recommend you watching this film without soda. It is so exciiting you will not want to leave to use the restroom, believe me. It does end on a cliffhanger, and I can't wait until the next one releases. P.S. Listen closely to Naomie Harris (Tia Dalma?) because in the theater I couldn't understand half the words she said."

","What a fun, demented movie! After the original pirates, I wasn't sure if a sequel could stay as clever and offbeat, but Dean Man's Chest delivers on nearly every front! Yes, it's great to see Johnny Depp's bizarre creation, Jack Sparrow, again, and this time to peer into his mind. The original film never really took a close look at the character, who returns this time with motivation, complexity, and (perhaps) genuine conflicting emotions. This installment also takes care of Orlando Bloom, whose character is given much more of a chance to be both leading man and action hero. Only Keira Knightley is given the short shrift, giving a great performance but only having a few scenes that really give her a chance to do anything with her character.<br/><br/>The special effects are as spectacular as it gets in this jaded age of CGI, and the fight sequences are intense and energetic. But what I loved the most about this movie was how wonderfully weird and demented it is. I won't give anything away, but just from the trailer you can already see Jack's eye makeup, a duel on a rolling mill wheel, and a villain with an octopus for a head, all much fresher and more demented than anything you usually find in Hollywood outside of the realm of Tim Burton. I had no idea Disney did things like that! This movie definitely lacks the strong, uncontrived storyline of its predecessor, clumsily maneuvering a number of contrivances to get the story rolling. The resulting plot is more a travelogue than anything, but fun nevertheless. It also picks up speed toward the end, and, for a film that sets itself up for the next installment, still works pretty well as standalone fare.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie, like the first, is first and foremost an exercise in camp and offbeat swashbucklery, which it delivers beautifully. Be warned that there are frequent references to the original film, many of them clever, others quite predictable. Still, as an extension of the original world and characters of Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie excels takes the cake, and in terms of blockbuster entertainment, there's nothing fresher or better under the sun."
"MovieZoo","7","2","4","7 July 2006"," I like my Sparrow well-done but you can keep the cheese
","Happy to say I thought the movie was OK. Sad to say, I am rating on the lower end of a 7.<br/><br/>So much repetition and too much time taken up with repetition. This is one of the few times I will say a movie was too long. But it is because of so much ""same ol', same ol'"". And I am not saying it the same ol' stuff from other movies but the same ol' stuff from the first movie.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is still entertaining and so is his soul, Johnny Depp. Orlando Bloom does everything right. He well deserves his own swashbuckling lead part. Keira's character is a nice ornament that I wouldn't throw out with the rum. But for the other characters, none held any intrigue for me. Don't get me wrong, they fit in but they had nothing spectacular going for them.<br/><br/>I think the very best part of the movie was one long action scene that played out some of the best choreographed action I have ever seen. This includes the best 3-party face off since ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"". AND this one far exceeds that face off.<br/><br/>You should see the movie if you liked the first, but be ready for a very rocky boat ride. Too much dialogue, too little good action, too much ""filler"" action, too many old faces, not enough of anything new and way too long. This movie could have been done in 90 minutes or so - and probably should have. Enjoy it, but don't expect anything except for a lot of makeup. Oh and that reminds me, there is one very interesting make-up scene but not enjoyable as it reminded of a last ditch effort to mix it up just for the sake of mixing it up(sorry, but no spoilers here).<br/><br/>I hope the end of the trilogy comes from the heart and not the pocket book as this one obviously did."

","OK, so I went and saw the 12:01 movie Friday Mornning. It was TOTALLY worth it.<br/><br/>The excitement throughout the theater was amazing. Every time one of the original characters appeared for the first time everyone cheered. (Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, etc.)<br/><br/>People from the age of (what looked like) 80 to 10 were there. I Guess Johnny Depp got exactly what he wanted. He wanted every person that went to see the movie, regardless of age, to enjoy it and get the same thing out of it.<br/><br/>I went with my best friend and my dad. My friend and i are absolutely obsessed with these movies and, well, Johnny Depp himself. Now my dad on the other hand, has never really been a Johnny Depp fan and never saw the Curse of the Black Pearl. Although, about 10 seconds after the end credits (which reminds me, watch all the way until the very last person is credited in this movie.) he told me that we were watching The Curse of the Black Pearl this weekend because he never realized why i loved these movies so much and why i begged him to drive us all the way out to Universal at 10:30 to get good seats and make sure we got our reserved tickets.<br/><br/>This movie is just as funny as the first, and a lot of the jokes from the first movie are revisited (making them about 5x funnier).<br/><br/>Overall, this movie surpassed the expectations that were set, making it one of the best movies of (quite possibly) the year.<br/><br/>So what are you doing? Get off your butt and go see it!!!"
"LemonyShepard","10","2","4","7 July 2006"," The best movie of the summer...savvy?
","I've seen many great movies this summer: X-Men 3, Cars, Click, Superman Returns...but one of them blows the others clear out of the water (no pun intended). Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is, by far, the ultimate summer movie, being even better than Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>The movie begins with Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (played by Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly, respectively) arrested for aiding the roguish Jack Sparrow (the ingenious Johnny Depp) in acts of piracy. Meanwhile, Jack is reminded of his debt to the ghostly Davey Jones (voiced by Bill Nighly). In order to save himself from Davey's locker, Jack must find the key to the Dead Man's Chest and steal its contents.<br/><br/>The movie is highly action-packed and introduces many great characters, along with bringing back some old favorites (Pintel and Ragetti returning for some amazing comic relief). The special effects are top-notch and Davey Jones, though completely CGI, looks 100% real and still sends shivers down one's timbers. Kevin McNally does another remarkable job as pirate Gibbs, having a slightly larger part in this movie. A nice addition to the cast is the somewhat freaky-looking Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), who shares a humorous scene with Jack involving an undead monkey and a jar of dirt. Classic! The story never seemed rushed and was never dull at any point. Johnny Depp is as amazing as ever. People actually applauded in the theatre when he appeared on screen in his hilarious introduction. Orlando Bloom definitely seemed to have taken some acting lessons or something because his performance in this movie was a lot better than the first. Kiera Knightly is, of course, as beautiful as ever, but that doesn't mean that she can't kick a little pirate booty. Norrington makes another appearance and, man, were people shocked to see him and hiscondition. Sadly, Cutler Beckett and Bootstrap Bill Turner are supposed to be important characters, you never feel a strong attachment with them. Maybe if they got more screen time? One of the best scenes involves Will, Jack, Elizabeth, Norrington, Pintel, Ragetti, and Davey's phantom army fighting for the Dead Man's Chest. It was probably the best scene in the movie.<br/><br/>And then, there's the ending. The last ten minutes had everyone in the theatre on the edge of their seats, and the last ten seconds left everyone breathless and crying out for more. The great thing about this movie is, no matter how long it is, you never seem to want enough. That's what makes a great movie.<br/><br/>Phenomenal acting, a great story, and a cliff-hanging plot-twist that makes Pirate-fan's hearts skipping, this movie promises to be this summer's biggest blockbustersavvy?"
"CaitTerese","10","2","4","7 July 2006"," It's riveting, on the edge of your seat action that'll leave you begging for more.
","This is an amazing movie. It's action filled: the numerous battle scenes are great. The plot takes quite a few hairpin turns that have you on the edge of your seat for most of the movie. The new characters are absolutely amazing, especially Davy Jones and his Crew: the special effects are out of this world. And the original characters develop so much more from the first movie, showing you more of their motives and reasonings. Jack is still a humorous, swashbuckling, stumbling, pirate; but he definitely shows more of the compassionate, and human side of his personality that you don't see in the first movie. Finally, it ends with a completely unexpected twist that has you begging for more. Overall, this movie went far and beyond my expectations!"
"zackmanze","10","2","4","7 July 2006"," Awesome movie, more entertaining than the first.
","I saw the midnight screening last night and wow, best movie this year, and last year. Just absolutely fantastic. Much more entertaining as the first. It had great action, great scary moments, but they were more like jump, not get grossed out. Great romance, but it was obviously just a setup for part 3, at the end of the world. But overall i loved this movie. The theater i was at was absolutely packed, so a lot of cheering and clapping. I loved the movie. The biggest problem was the way it explained things, the movie starts off, you don't even know how long after black peal, and they never want to really explain what happened, you know will and Elizabeth were going to get married,d, so they were engaged, but they couldn't. And then some new governor guy, you don't even know where he came from, it was trying to explain ahead, taking no time to explain behind and at the current time. The sea monsters weren't as cool as the undead pirates, but they looked cooler. There is a 4 part fight that takes place, ( it's the only super cool fight. ) That's just amazing. The flying Dutchman was cool, and Davy Jones was just awesome. There is a huge cliff hanger ending, and some one returns from the dead, and someone dies. So yeah, honestly, as good as it was it was setting up for the last part of the trilogy. But i really enjoyed this movie. There is 3 seems with the Garrik or w/e, the giant dragon octopus. Well, he's fighting the black pearl in one scene, and it's crew, and i was just sitting there on the edge of my seat thinking, so when is Toby gonna show up in the red and blue suit? ( if you don't now what that means, your just dumb. ) But i loved the movie, funnier than the first, and the monkey is back, Johnny doesn't have as much funny lines. But he does a lot more funny actions. This is NOT a kids movie, don't take any one under 10, they will be scared to death! But if you read the story books for the movie, don't worry, it's a lot better. But overall i loved this movie.<br/><br/>Characters: 10/10, great,! Acting: 9/10 Johnny Dept didn't do quite as good a job as in the first.<br/><br/>Character Development: 9/10 The main character development was perfect, but the other characters you only saw for about 10 minutes of screen time max.<br/><br/>Story: 8/10 : Obviosly setting up for at worlds end, but it stayed strong, and lots of great plot twists.<br/><br/>Feel to the movie: 10/10: Just edge of your seat, laughing, cheering, great movie.<br/><br/>entertaining: 11/10: Most entertaining movie i've ever seen.<br/><br/>action: 8/10: It was great, but only two really long sword fights, and the style of the sword fighting i didn't prefer, i prefer more of a star wars episode 3 battle kind of fighting, you know, Jedi and what not.<br/><br/>CG: Amazing, best ever Period! 10/10 Scary: 9/10 As scary as it could be for a PG-13 family movie... Well, teen family movie...<br/><br/>Appropriateness: 8/10 I found a lot of scenes that would scare little children, so don't take them to it.<br/><br/>But overall i loved this movie, 9.8 out of 10, and it can't win an Oscar, because it had no gays, it was entertaining, had good acting, good story, great CG.

","In the second installment of the ""Pirates"" trilogy, the action is more intense and we begin to feel for the characters in a new way.

With the coming of ""Bootstraps"" Bill Turner, we know that Davy Jones is looking for Jack Sparrow to fulfill a life debt. Of course, Jack is all too ready to hand over his friends to Jones to save his soul. Will is the first to go and Sparrow promises to find 99 more souls to hand over to Jones for an eternity of servitude in the dark depths of the seas. <br/><br/>This film is the must-see film of the summer and I, personally, cannot wait for the third installment next Memorial Day weekend. <br/><br/>Yo ho, mates, we have our heading."

","This movie was excellent. I have been anticipating this movie for a long time and it exceeded my expectations. It was very visual, but was not lacking I'm plot or character development. The story was well thought out and leads nicely into the third installment in the series. Every character was given a bit of time to shine and each took turns stealing their respective scenes. If there was any weakness in the movie at all it was that it seemed to me that Johnny Depp was forcing the character of Jack Sparrow a bit in the early parts of the movie. It was a great show and I plan on seeing it again in the theaters since I enjoyed myself so much! 10 out of 10!"
"little_miss_jade_1","5","2","4","7 July 2006"," Hit...but near miss
","While this film is a must see for all Pirates fans it was not all i had imaged as the sequel to the much loved original. Being two and a half hours in length, there is quite a lot of action and character/story development, yet the pace of the movie created anticipation and a feeling that this film is merely a go between to the third and final film in the trilogy. The reprisals of Captain Jack Sparrow, Elizabeth Swan and Will Turner were true to the previous film with outstanding performances by Depp, Knightley and Bloom as well as the fabulous supporting cast including the brilliant Bill Nighy. However Nighy brought a darker and more intense mood to the film with his villain - Davy Jones. This was hard to counter act but Johnny did not disappoint with witty one liners and neither did the cast with ensemble slapstick. There were many references to the original film but i feel that some of the spirit or ""scally wag"" elements linked to the first film were lost to the epic sea battles and evil plots.<br/><br/>Overall the film was very enjoyable and the visual effects and CGI were amazing. If you loved the original this will not disappoint and is a pleasurable experience and if you haven't seen the original i suggest you check it out before viewing the second. Enjoy the movie!"

"DrTuvok","8","0","0","7 July 2020"," Disney's last great blockbuster
","Dead Man's Chest arrived at a time when the epic blockbuster era (1999-2008) was beginning to die out, and stands as arguably Disney's last great live-action effort in this genre, unless you're feeling generous towards John Carter. It has a quality that many of today's 'epic' blockbusters are sorely lacking, and has much better special effects than anything produced in the last decade, interestingly enough. And unlike any fantasy/sci fi movie I've seen in what seems forever, it is exciting. The action set-pieces are all extremely well done, and are the most commendable things in the movie. At times it veers into over-the-top bombastic Peter Jacksonian territory (not one, but TWO big kraken attacks), but that's not necessarily a bad thing when tempered with a sense of humor. The cannibal island escape is creative and funny, almost like a Laurel and Hardy comedy. The Kraken is relentlessly built up during the film's first hour and a half so when it finally comes, the attempts of the doomed sailors to fight it seem all the more desperate and dangerous. (Nobody flying around and shooting CGI jazz from their hands like what we get in all these cruddy superhero movies. I cannot overstate how much that helps the suspense and rewatchability.). The mill fight scene is so creatively bonkers; we're given six different motivations for different people all trying to out-cheat each other. The whole sequence is really something, you have to go back to Indiana Jones to get something like this.<br/><br/>The worst thing about this movie is that it all functions as a setup to the mediocre third installment. Also, it spends so much time building its influx of characters into the loopy plot that none of them really get any time to change or evolve. With action scenes this good, though, who's complaining?"

","Pirates does well do add an interesting story line in Dead Man's Chest, but it was always going to struggle to be better than the Curse of the Black Pearl. This story got a bit more outrageous and over the top. With Jack becoming the King/Chieftain of a whole village on a remote island, to some exaggerated action scenes with the pirates swinging in a giant ball and climbing up the cliff or the giant wheel battle. Although it does stick out in my mind as entertaining and memorable. But just a bit over the top. The characters all return in good strength, and the movie is enjoyable, not enough to get me fizzed and watch every movie in the series."

On the other hand some dialogs are really funny, and the whole movie is more like a parody on pirates.<br/><br/>All and all: go and see this, sit down in that cinema and have a good time with friends, but if you are more into ""heavy for the mind"" stuff, this is not a must-see for you."

"fernandoschiavi","8","0","0","28 May 2020"," With a completely unexpected, hopeless and open ending, ""Dead Man's Chest"" provides an endless adventure, first-rate special effects, chilling scenes and romance
","After the resounding success of the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", it was only natural that Disney started planning sequences for this great phenomenon. The two sequences to ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" were conceived in 2004, with Elliott and Rossio developing a story arc that would last both films. Filming took place from February to September 2005 in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Palos Verdes, Dominica and the Bahamas, as well as on the sets built at Walt Disney Studios. The film was recorded together with the third film in the series, ""At the End of the World"".<br/><br/>Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the daughter of Governor Weatherby (Jonathan Pryce), is about to marry blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). However, the event is hampered by the threat of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the captain of the haunted Flying Dutchman, who owes blood to Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the couple's friend. Fearing being cursed to an afterlife as a slave to Jones, Sparrow must find the mysterious chest of death to escape the threat.<br/><br/>This second part of the sequence manages to surpass the previous film in quality and scale. The combination of humor and adventure worked so well previously that it was maintained and expanded. Although the option is for a darker film than the previous one, the chemistry between the main actors still exists and this time even entitled to a climate of love triangle - mainly reflecting the change in attitude of Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, more mature. Another aspect of the franchise is the way the legends of the sea are used to compose this universe that mixes fantasy and reality. The first film had done this with the cursed gold, and this second did something similar with Davy Jones and the Kraken. With the absence of Geoffrey Rush in the cast (at least until the final minutes), the writers, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, needed someone to match Sparrow to meet the pirate and Jones was the perfect choice, both for his characterization, as for the man who lives the character.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the script of the duo Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott is right to bet on a different film in structure and narrative progression, by avoiding thematic repetitions of the damsel in distress or cursed treasure, preferring to keep the characters separated in different subplots and offer a much more macguffin interesting in the shape of the chest that names the film. The entire arc of Jack Sparrow running to save his soul offers more dangerous risks and really brilliant ideas from the team, from the convict crew that slowly fuse with marine elements and the structure of the Dutch Flying Ship to the imminent threat of the monstrous squid mythological giant, the Kraken.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the duo's script does not show such care in all its parts. Inheriting one of the problems of the first film: the prolonged duration, Dead Man's Chest extends for two and a half hours, making this an exhausting adventure. Although they are probably the funniest and most creative parts of the film, the part on the island with cannibals will be totally dispensable to the story narrative, serving only for distraction and adding nothing to the main plot. This is one of the examples of the increase in the scale of the film, but the extra time is not used to delve into the machinations of Becket or Jones, but with expendable passages that have no influence on the story. As a result, some aspects become confused, since they do not receive the necessary focus, while others sound too busy, see the whole interaction between Will and his father.<br/><br/>Since this film was shot with the third, much of the plot of Death Chest serves to explain concepts and characters that will gain more prominence and depth in the next chapter, as well as letting the film end on a devastating hook and perpetuating it as a work with no end, but which is part of a whole. Other problems include some inconclusive cores, such as the forced and artificial development of a ""love interest"" between Jack and Elizabeth, which yields only a turnaround during the climax, in addition to disposable moments of jealousy between the girl and Will - not to mention the presence of ex-commodore.
Regarding the cast, Depp maintains all his detailed physical construction and the character's mannerisms, such as the staggering gait and his arms always in motion, as if the character needed a lot of concentration to be able to stand. The character's wit and irony also return, but it is remarkable how Jack is much more comical here, see his hilarious performance when he is elected ""king"" by the cannibals of a local island. As for his scene mates, unfortunately Bloom maintains his striving performance on a single note, with Will's determination and willpower, while Keira Knightley benefits from the improvement in his character to bring more toughness to his performance, even though he maintains a femininity. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is the highlight here. A tragic and heartbroken villain, Jones is a ghostly presence that we are both able to fear and admire at the same time, and much of this is due to Bill Nighy's impressive performance capture mix with Industrial Light & Magic's photorealistic visual effects., deservedly awarded Oscar for his work here.<br/><br/>From the first frame of the film, Verbinski's care in establishing a beautiful and realistic world can be seen, with the beautiful and melancholy image of a deserted wedding ceremony punished by a heavy rain, taking us immediately to a terrifying dungeon where we see crows pulling out the eyes of living men ... until breaking it all up with an appropriately hilarious introduction to Jack Sparrow, demonstrating his incredible control of rhythm and pitch variation, something that is crucial to the success of the production. Not to mention the Kraken's gradual appearances. The first is something practically out of a terror, with a violent suction that sinks a small fishing boat in a matter of seconds, gaining a much more elaborate resourcefulness when we get to the second attack. Here, we see the filmmaker's ability to control the spatial geography of events, keeping our focus on Will Turner climbing a mast while his camera roams the chaos on the deck and all desperate men are grabbed by the creature's giant tentacles.<br/><br/>Verbinski and director of photography Dariusz Wolski know how to work with night scenes without making them excessively dark, using wet scenes and characters and moonlight to justify the presence of light. They capture the naturalism of the beautiful landscapes and locations where history walks, which include the colorful island of cannibals, marked by the green of their tree tops, to the climax at Isla Cruces, where we have a duel of swords on a sandy beach very white. Indoor scenes involving candlelight, especially the ship's cabin and the sequence in Tortuga, bring a typical orange of the light source flame and a remarkable contrast between the other scenes, with the color changing drastically to a heavier shade and bluish during the moments in the Flying Dutchman, creating a terrifying environment that really looks like a marine hell. In fact, the memorable characterization of the Flying Dutchman and his crew is a spectacle by the production designer and art director. Merging crustaceans with marine beings, they all gain strong visual identities, not being as forgettable as the skeletons of the first film.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer, Oscar-winning composer for ""The Lion King"", returned to the post of composer of the franchise's soundtrack and did the unimaginable: he surpassed the quality of the tracks shown in the first feature. With all the mythology suffered by Davy Jones around his love and hate for Calypso, Zimmer tried to compose the character's theme in a way that showed all his feelings, and succeeded. Not to mention the Kraken scenes.<br/><br/>With a completely unexpected, hopeless and open ending, ""Dead Man's Chest"" provides an endless adventure, first-rate special effects, chilling scenes and romance in the right measure - but a decision was wise enough to guarantee the good result: the characters and the plot are attractive enough to guarantee the viewer's attention and make him anxious for the third part that will end the arc of this first trilogy."

","To be a great sequel a movie must expand on the world, create new characters with new stories, and continue already existing characters and stories abd ""Dead Man's Chest"" executes those categories perfectly. But as a movie it has some rough patches such as a sluggish pace and underdeveloped aspects like secondary antagonist, Cutler Beckett. But most all other things it 1-ups ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" with a better plot that is set, established, and excuted perfectly involving all characters with high individual stakes."

","What a fantastic sequel to a Classic.
""Dead Man's chest"" is another Masterpiece like the first film by the brilliant visionary director Gore Virbinski, a stunning piece of filmmaking with some of the best special effects I've ever seen in a movie!!!
This time Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth are mixed up with the Mystery & Legend of Davey Jones Locker & what we get is an Amazing swashbuckling, Cannibal, Jungle & sea creatures action adventure flick.
The look of the slimey octopus mutant Davey Jones is just amazing & his sea creatures mutated crew all look fantastic & scary & so richly detailed they are a work of Art.
The first time we meet the Deep sea monster crew is an incredible sequence that feels like a Horror movie it's done so well with such a creepy atmosphere, i loved it.<br/><br/>The performances are all great again & Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow was actually better this time around as he was toned down i felt with his bizarre ways & it was better.
Orlando Bloom is great again as the real action hero of the movie Will Turner & his beautiful bride-to-be Elizabeth played by Keira Knightley is funny & cunning. The real star of this show goes to the Amazing performance of the main monster himself Davey Jones performed & voiced by Bill Nighy under alot of c.g.i effects but an incredible creation.<br/><br/>Dead Man's chest is a such a fun & beautiful looking Gothic monster movie with beautiful cinematography & richly textured & detailed sets & characters.
One of the best Adventure films ever made in my opinion. Another Masterpiece that's a joy to watch over & over again."

","It's been awhile since I've watched any of these movies, but I felt like I'd watched this one the least and felt the need to rewatch it. It's quite entertaining, and the effects are very good.

","It takes a while for 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006)' to come together but, once it does, it's an enjoyable adventure that maintains the spirit of its superior predecessor. Depp continues his tightrope walk of a performance but he isn't quite as sure-footed as before. His character is even more selfish, basing his relationships entirely on a series of double-crosses and triple-crosses so that he can come out on top. He does have an arc that sees him, essentially, admit that he really does care for his pirating buddies, but by the time it's complete it's almost too little too late. This makes him less empathetic and, combined with his ever-so-slightly annoying mannerisms (which are accentuated through the actual screenplay this time), creates a less compelling character than you'd expect. The villain this time is Nighy's Davy Jones - an impressive, entirely digital character - who hunts our hero for the hundred years of service he owes and somehow manages to add an extra vowel to every other word. He's a good baddie, suitably callous and commanding, but he can't compete with the previous entry's Barbossa. The plot is sprawling and sporadic, featuring less swashbuckling than its predecessor and relying on the fact that it is, in essence, 'part one'. Indeed, the narrative doesn't actually complete itself in a satisfying way; it just sort of ends, with the denouement being dedicated entirely to cheap sequel bait. Still, the story is entertaining and the set-pieces are well-conceived. The stand-out is clearly an extended sabre duel between three of the focal characters, which starts on a beach and ends on a rampaging, ever-spinning wheel. The thing does a brilliant job of keeping track of its characters, with everyone's position and motive being clear at all times. This is as important in the action as it is in the set-up, which sees most of the core cast separated. By the time everyone comes together, the movie is in full swing and it's a fair bit of fun. It doesn't match the quality of the first film in the series, but it's a decent continuation and a good time in its own right. 7/10"

Jack Sparrow seems to have changed from a brave, sarcastic, yet kind hearted hero to a rapist and turncoat.

","Three years after the instant classic The Curse of the Black Pearl (10/10) the Pirates franchise returned, yet with another banger. 
What makes the series so great is that it is filled with so many great actors, that always deliver.
The story is straight forward and gripping from the first minute. There is this real passion and real tactile sense of evil, perfectly portrayed by Davy Jones, who could also top Captain Barbosa from the first outing as the series best main villain. The movie is like a puzzle, the more you watch the more it gets interesting, the more you see the connections between the multiple storylines. 
Johnny Depp once again is amazing acting the highly charismatic, funny and cool Jack Sparrow so damn well.

"jaredpahl","9","0","0","3 June 2017"," For Rip-Roaring Summer Adventure, It Doesn't Get Better Than Dead Man's Chest
","When the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, Curse of the Black Pearl, became a cinematic sensation overnight in 2003, a sequel was all but assured. Thankfully, Dead Man's Chest builds on its predecessor, rather than coasting off its success. With Gore Verbinski back in the director's chair and salivating at the chance to up the ante on the first film, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is simply electrifying. Thrilling, humorous, and straight up fun, Dead Man's Chest is a skillfully crafted summer blockbuster with more exuberant joy per square minute than just about everything else hitting cinemas today.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest amps up the stakes dramatically from Curse of the Black Pearl. Where that film was a straightforward adventure in the vein of the classic pirate movies of the 1930s through the 50s, the sequel is darker and more dramatic, while still retaining the wholesome charm of the first film. Captain Jack Sparrow, once again played with enthusiastic charm by Johnny Depp, is the focal point of the plot this time around. A prior deal with this film's villain, the grotesque fish creature named Davy Jones (motion captured by Bill Nighy), leaves Jack Sparrow on the run as Jones and the cursed crew of his ship, The Flying Dutchman, lead a relentless pursuit. This short summary fails to capture the complexity of the story of Dead Man's Chest. There is a lot to keep track of here. The rules for the various ancient curses and spells are given an exorbitant amount of screen time and the peripheral characters each have their own side stories which converge around this film's MacGuffin, a chest containing the still-beating heart of Davy Jones. <br/><br/>Would it be a better film if the story shed some of the superfluous side stories and charted a simpler path? I'm not sure that's the case. The story of Dead Man's Chest is very involved with many moving parts, but it is not particularly difficult to follow. Basically, Pirates 2 simply raises the stakes from the first movie. It's a grander adventure. A pirate saga where characters like Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann get some appreciated character development. Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly both give an earnest sweetness to roles that may have otherwise rang hollow. The story is also a good deal grimmer than the first movie. Most of that darkness comes from Nighy's Davy Jones. Jones and his crew are the standouts of the movie. The Flying Dutchman's half man, half fish creatures (envisioned by master designer Crash McCreery) are wonders of imagination in the way they combine man and sea in constantly inventive ways. Jones himself is one of the great special effects creations ever. The iconic coiling tentacles that make up Jones' beard are completely photo-realistic, even in extreme close-up. You never believe what you are looking at is an effect. Jones is as real a CGI creature as I've ever seen. It's in his eyes though that ILM's work really shines. Nighy's spirit is all there and his unpredictable motion capture performance gives Davy Jones tremendous menace whenever he's on the screen. <br/><br/>If Johnny Depp's breakout performance as Captain Jack stole the show in the first Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest belongs to Gore Verbinski. Verbinski is clearly having a blast with this script (written by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio), and his passion is there from the opening frame. There is a youthful vigor and enthusiasm for filmmaking all throughout this film's two and a half hour run time. Verbinski has an eye for adventure, and his complete command over tone is unmatched. When Dead Man's Chest commits to scenes of classic swashbuckling excitement, this thing sings. The locations are so lush and vibrant, the characters are so charming, and the action scenes are so fervently inventive, that Dead Man's Chest completely overcomes any narrative bloat it might have. This movie is a feast of pure adventure spectacle. The big action set-pieces, the most exciting of which are an elaborate three-way sword-fight through the jungle on a giant wooden wheel and an epic attack by the mythical Kraken, are showcases for Verbinski's talent at giving his action scenes personality and life. Here is a director who just knows how to mix thrills and humor into a perfect entertainment gumbo. The balance is effortless. For their part, the cast does phenomenal work keeping up with Verbinski's manic energy as well. There is something to be said about how lively an action scene can be when you can see the actors savoring everything about the scenes they are in.<br/><br/>And it's not just the action scenes that spring to life on the screen. The entire movie is supercharged with crowd-pleasing energy. This is one big, lovable film. Even with a story that sometimes feels arbitrarily drawn out, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a soaring success because of director Gore Verbinski's zest for big budget summer popcorn filmmaking. From Verbinksi to every member of the enormous cast, everybody involved with this film seems to be fully committed to the spirit of fun that made Pirates of the Caribbean one of the most deservedly popular movie franchises ever. Dead Man's Chest is a top tier summer blockbuster, with a visionary director working the audience like a fiddle. In Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Gore Verbinski takes us on an unforgettable ride. In a theater with a big crowd, it's as good a time as you will ever have at the movies.<br/><br/>93/100"

","The follow-up chapter to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl might appear inferior in content & a step-down in quality of narration but it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that presents significant upgrades in many aspects, takes the spectacle of the first film to a higher level and despite a few hiccups remains a highly entertaining & amusing ride for the most part.<br/><br/>The second installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Dead Man's Chest continues the journey of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as he's reminded of the debt he owes to Davy Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, and then races against time to steal Jones' heart in order to strike a bargain with him. But he isn't the only one as other friends & foes seek the heart for their own agendas as well.<br/><br/>Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest opens on a really interesting note, takes more time than before to set up its premise because of which a few sequences feel static but once the board is set, the movie truly delivers the epic spectacle it promised. The screenplay follows multiple story lines often interacting with each other at times but it does come together in the end to form a coherent structure.<br/><br/>The technical aspects present a massive upgrade, thanks to the higher budget. Set pieces are even more impressive than before and both the Black Pearl & the Flying Dutchman are magnificently designed & detailed. Cinematography exhibits a dynamic range in capturing all the action & drama, the exotic locations are beautifully photographed and it also makes extensive use of the colour palette to provide its tale a more vivid touch.<br/><br/>Editing fails to give the narrative a tightly-knitted structure like it did in the earlier chapter for there are a few sequences that could've been further trimmed, even the pace is uneven at places and its 150 minutes of runtime is felt on few occasions. Visual effects is a major step-up that ups the ante by a significant margin and what it did with CGI back then was an achievement in itself, most impressive part of it being the sea monster Kraken as well as the convincing portrait of Davy Jones.<br/><br/>Finally, the music department exhibits a major forward leap as well. While the previous film was scored by one of Hans Zimmer's prodigies, it's the master himself who takes the front seat for this sequel and delivers a soundtrack that certainly goes down as one of his finest compositions. Orchestrated with bigger instruments, Zimmer's score pulsates with an epic feel that encapsulates the whole picture and goes a long way in enhancing the experience.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley reprise their respective roles of Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth Swann and further build upon their inputs of the first film. Depp once again overshadows everyone with yet another swashbuckling turn as the savvy pirate but his performance isn't as terrific as it was in the previous movie. Also making an instant impression of his own is Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, who happens to be a strange mix of aquatic flora & fauna.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest might be slightly inferior to The Curse of the Black Pearl but it's just as enjoyable, entertaining & amusing, if not more. The plot tends to be more inclined towards the fantasy element but it takes the humour with it and the sense of adventure is kept alive throughout its runtime. It's just that few scenes exist only for viewers' amusement & contribute nothing to the story. More epic in both scope & ambition, Dead Man's Chest is definitely a fun experience that gets most things right, if not all. Delightfully recommended"

","This movie is where Jack Sparrow starts becoming a caricature of his former self. In the first film he was funny, smart and also very skilled. In this film he starts becoming a bumbling and clumsy character who survives because he is lucky more than because of his skill. He comes off as intelligent at times in Dead Man's Chest, but that intelligence is often nullified because of over-the-top action that is so improbable that it makes Jack Sparrow seem unkillable.<br/><br/>The introduction of Jack into the Elizabeth and Will romance to make this a love triangle is also extremely forced. The film starts off by showing the audience that Will and Elizabeth really are in love with each other and they are willing to do whatever they need to get each other back, but then the indication from the compass is that Elizabeth all of sudden really wants Jack Sparrow. This storyline is STUPID and FORCED!<br/><br/>The movie is, however, highlighted by a cool representation of Davy Jones and a great 3rd act fight scene between Jack, Will and Norrington, but a few great action scenes and a great villain don't make a great movie. Jack Sparrow has become a funny, but at times unbearable character, The Will and Elizabeth dynamic has been watered down by a forced love triangle and the friendship between Jack and Will has been downgraded to hardly a friendship at all. In fact, why would Will even care about trying to save him after what he's done in this movie?<br/><br/>4/10. If you want to watch a good Pirates movie, then stick to the first one."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","14 December 2014"," The end of the Black Pearl? The end of Jack Sparrow?
","""Dead Man's Chest"" is the second installment from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise, directed just like 1 and 3 by Gore Verbinski and Elliott and Rosso are back as writers too. I felt that, in this movie, Jack Sparrow's character was not the one at the center, but Orlando Bloom's was. Which hurt the movie a lot as Bloom still needs to convince me as a dramatic actor and he did not even pull off the hero part here in a way that I liked it. But don't worry. Knightley is a lot in it as well, mostly as a female pirate this time and Johnny Depp gets lots of screen time again as well and was maybe the best thing about the film. Sparrow and Swann get even more sexual tension than in the first movie where there was only the island scene. Here at some point you could maybe even wonder for a moment if they become a couple. The film has a father-son storyline (Skarsgård, Bloom) and the main antagonist, the scary octopus pirate Davy Jones, is played by Bill Nighy. He was really good, though not as good as Rush in the first movie. But at the end it is revealed that Rush and Nighy will be in part 3, which makes me really curious.<br/><br/>Apart from that, the story was slightly weaker than in the first movie, the visual side was equally strong and even won an Academy Award this time, maybe mostly thanks to the spectacular final kraken fight scene. How did one single shot from Sparrow's gun manage to chase the kraken away though for a moment? The black-spots-on-the-hand plot did not really do much for me, so I could have done without it unless it is really elaborated on in the next film. The topic is a very traditional one in terms of pirate stories: the hunt for a key and a treasure chest. Some animals are included: a parrot, a small monkey and also a dog very brief. All in all, it is a family movie, maybe not for the very small ones, but the few violent scenes are not particularly graphic or are over very quickly. The commodore, or I should say ex-commodore, played by Jack Davenport is back too, but I have to say, unlike the first film, he did not do really much for me in this one. There's some human enemies trying to hang the protagonists (for helping Jack Sparrow) escape at the start of the film, but in terms of enemies, it is really all about Davy Jones here. Great character and I loved his immediate reaction to when he sees the chest is empty.<br/><br/>Sparrow himself was a bit of an anti-hero again. His return to the ship is displayed as heroic. But he gets punished hard for it. However, there was a reference early on how he kept calling himself Captain even when he had no ship, so he was probably obliged to return as a real captain would and his honor told him to. As a whole, this is a decent film, slightly worse than the original maybe, but not by much. Here and there, they could have cut a scene and kept it closer to 2 hours without hurting the overall outcome, but even this way I still recommend it."

","Obviously a considerable amount of hype went into the sequel after such a stellar first movie. With a sub-title like ""Dead Man's Chest"", anything could happen and there is a plethora of pirate lore to pick from.<br/><br/>Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann's (Keira Knightley) marriage is interrupted, as Will is acquired to collect a compass from Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to find the ""Dead Man's Chest"". Meanwhile, Sparrow discovers his debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is due and so begins the race for the chest, whilst having to escape the clutches of Davy Jones's pet, ""The Kraken"".<br/><br/>Things to definitely admire this time around are Bill Nighy's wonderful contributions as a performer. Watching him reveals an inner conflict to the character, that never surfaces to an extent where it appears formulaic. Johnny Depp is still wonderful, and definitely keeps true to the character he made iconic in so little time. Plus, the movies $225 million budget spares no expense in terms of stunts and visuals.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for as decent as the visuals are in this picture the story is pretty dull. The film-makers certainly enjoy bringing a sense of ""darker"" elements this time around, but it felt like everything else was sacrificed in the process. Most character development is shoddy, and the dialogue isn't much either. All in all, I still love Gore Verbinski's camera work and the level of development is admirable, yet the narrative can't help but feel dumbed down into many Hollywood cliché's. Those well choreographed fight scenes now implement some intentionally hammy stunts and mishaps that never descend the movie into slapstick, but certainly more style over substance. <br/><br/>Final Verdict: A movie worth seeing for performances alone, however everything else is severely lacking. 6.5/10."

","'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' was fresh and funny, a mixture of pirate adventure, comedy and horror film; but it's sequel, 'Dead Man's Chest', only illustrates the point that most sequels would have been better off unmade. Specatacular special effects come to completely dominate the film, mostly because of the essentially uninteresting (and, in the way of all middle-parts of trilogies, unresolved) plot; above all else, for all the visual inventiveness, there's nothing new here, just an endless re-interpretation of the same jokes and characters that sparkled in the first movie but which here just pall.

"mnpollio","6","0","0","28 December 2010"," Overly busy sequel with some high points
","Some people actually prefer this sequel to the original, although it is difficult to imagine why. The wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann is disrupted when a bloodthirsty corporate pipsqueak demands that they locate a compass in Captain Jack Sparrow's possession which he imagines will give him domain over the seas, while Jack finds himself forced to repay a debt to the ghastly Davy Jones - captain of the infamous Flying Dutchman - lest he become the latest ghoul addition to Jones' crew. One certainly cannot accuse the plot of sitting on its laurels...and that is the problem. The plot is overly busy and laden with unnecessary exposition which slows down the pace and allows the charm and fun from the original to wane. There are definitely comic highlights - such as a couple of madcap chases. The cast members are still in top form even when the screenplay fails to support them. Depp is chronically watchable in this role and nothing can change that fact. Jack Davenport gets more notes to play this time around as down-on-his-luck Norrington and Naomie Harris is a delightful addition as the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma. Keira Knightley gets much more to do this time around and is fortunate enough to be thrown together with Depp. Orlando Bloom - who functioned as the heart of the original film - is saddled with a tiresome subplot, which finds him stuck for much of the film on the Flying Dutchman trying to ""rescue"" his father, played by a shell-shocked Stellan Skarsgard. It is a subplot that we cannot get behind and fails to have much impact. Similarly, the screenplay has characters that we should support betray each other repeatedly on a dime - including a late act development which is really hard to buy. Bill Nighy is visually impressive as the squid-like Davy Jones, but neither he nor sniveling Tom Hollander as the corporate stooge resonate with the viewer as strongly as Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa. The final moments set up the next installment and offer a glimmer that it may surpass this effort."

The story is so convoluted that it makes virtually no sense. The special effects are done well, and it's fun to watch Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightley perform, but they don't have much of a script to work with.

","Compared to The Curse of the Black Pearl, Dead Man's Chest is more epic in terms of following the story. Epic is a word I'd place in onto a movie/show with an ever-evolving scope (for example, LOST, The Lord of the Rings, all of the Star Wars movies, and the first Jurassic Park -- as well as Gone With the Wind, Ben-Hur and Lawrence of Arabia). While this is a fun film, it's very disappointing.<br/><br/>The acting this go around is only slightly as good as that of the first. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is into a jam that is nicely conceived, only the jokes this time are old and rely more on slapstick. Orlando Bloom is good here and there, yet some of the more dramatic moments are borderline mediocre. Keira Knightley's mourning near the end of the film is ho-hum, however Bill Nighy has Davy Jones is the best that is offered.<br/><br/>The music is terrible in Dead Man's Chest. Now that Zimmer is fully on board, his contributions are less than exciting or original. There's nice themes for the Kraken that come and go, and the bombast of Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman is definitely the best of all the score. Just disappointing, as there's hardly any sweep. I don't recommend it to anyone unless you're a collector like me.<br/><br/>The visual effects are terrific. The Kraken is great, and Davy Jones is right up there with Gollum and King Kong as the most realistic CG characters on screen.<br/><br/>The writing is confusing at times. Some of our character's motives are unclear, providing for some awkward scenes of intimacy and betrayal. Gore Verbinski's carbon-copy direction adds nothing to the palette either.<br/><br/>All in all, Dead Man's Chest is worth a watch, even if I didn't enjoy it. It's good for kids 11 and under (the trilogy as a whole), and that's where it should stay."

"funkyfry","5","0","0","20 March 2007"," Decent fun but not as special as the first
","The first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie was kind of a surprise -- I don't think expectations were really high for the film but it was a huge hit and in my opinion a lot of fun. The reverse is true now of the film's first sequel -- expectations were high and at least for me it was a letdown.<br/><br/>The story finds our heroes Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) once again in danger from an overzealous British naval captain (whose name I didn't catch and whose work was unexceptional). Will must try to fetch an important artifact from his friend Jack Sparrow (John Depp) to secure his future bride's freedom. She takes care of that with a little help from her dad (Jon Pryce) and joins him on the mad quest to do something vaguely connected to the compass and the ""still beating heart"" of Davey Jones (Bill Nighy).<br/><br/>So much for the film's plot, which feels like an obligatory afterthought to the effects and the character interactions. The plot just doesn't seem as compelling nor as tight as it was in the first film. Orlando Bloom shows no signs of growing ability or screen presence, in contrast to Knightley who gives probably the film's most surprising performance. The character work is also disappointing -- Bill Nighy is a good actor but here he's totally obscured by the effects and unable at any rate to even approximate the level of villainous charisma that enabled Geoff Rush to hold his own with Depp. Depp himself was disappointing to me as he seemed to be willing to act within the confines of what he had already done in the first film, and his character didn't have the kind of vague menace and wildness that it had in the first one. The film also follows the disappointing trend of many sequels of using lines that were well used in the original film in inappropriate situations in the sequels (the ""I'll be back"" syndrome, if you will) -- here we have supporting characters played by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Cook cornering Ms. Swann and regaling her with a re-run of ""hello poppet!"". It's just lame and unimaginative, like Lucas with his pointless repetition of the ""I have a bad feeling about this"" line.<br/><br/>The sea creature villains are just not as interesting as the undead pirates in the first film. Also the makeup is relatively poor... I thought particularly the makeup on ""Bootstrap Bill Turner"" was unconvincing. It looked like the makeup from an 80s episode of Star Trek.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely long and has no conclusion -- not even the kind of temporary closure provided in other films like ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>All in all I can say I wasn't bored -- the film's visual effects alone make for some interesting moments. But I just didn't feel caught up in it like I did in the first film, it felt manufactured. Things that were once exciting now feel like a routine. I'll probably return for the final film in the series hoping it will be more satisfying... but I couldn't recommend this film to anyone but fans of the series."

","Pirates 2 is Johnny Depp's show...his eyeliner wearing, rum-soaked Cap'n Sparrow has fun even when selling out his friends to undead fish people. Depp is truly the most interesting thing about the movie, a bombastic, CGI soaked affair with some impressive special effects and solid action scenes.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Pirates 2 lies with Depp's supporting cast. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are both very pretty, but neither comes close to matching Depp's charisma. Bloom in particular may look good in knickers, but for all his swashbuckling and hero-making, his performance is as bland as dishwater. The film's physically unappealing secondary characters are much more interesting. Pintel and Ragetti are strangely likable, Davy Jones is satisfyingly grotesque, and I found myself weirdly attracted to Tia Dalma.<br/><br/>Pirates 2 is very dark for a Disney flickalong with the requisite pirate-y betrayal and (figurative) backstabbing, there's some relatively nasty PG-13 deaths (including throat cuttings and hatchet hackings) and I know if I was six I'd be terrified of Jones and his scaly crew. Older viewers won't be bored by this film, but unless they're huge Depp fans, they won't be that thrilled, either."

"oneloveall","6","0","0","3 December 2006"," Less personality and more focused adventuring makes for a tighter popcorn swashbuckler
","When version number two of the expected Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy came out it was near universally met by critics with dumbed-down groans, the usual lamenting done for a sequel that sells itself short on the personality and originality that thrived in the first place, and puts instead in it's place the over-bloated, inauthentic substitute for personality through mindless action sequencing, peppered with the franchise mentality of sameness, repetition, and reiteration. Not surprisingly, these critical warnings issued by our film protectors were amply ignored by the film-going public, making Dead Man's Chest the surprise top grossing movie of last season. For once I must admit the general public seemed to have gotten it right. Pirates II may not be as authentic, personal, or charming as it's predecessor, but in my experience it was a more fluid, well plotted, entertaining excursion out to sea. Whereas part one seemed to lack direction in it's script, gleefully bouncing around from one local to the next without doing much to justify the transition, Dead Man's Chest seems way more the traditional adventure these pirates were meant to have. I also have heard complaints in Johnny Depp's declining authenticity in the lead role of the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow, and must also scratch my head. While the lines that were written for him may have been layered on a little too thick, Depp almost seems to be more subdued in the role now, which helped take the focus off of his every drunken stumble and peculiar facial expression that the first concentrated on heavily, to a fault of the plot. Here, Sparrow and company seem to have a more clear cut purpose which helps viewers engage in the adventure all the more. While we are still dealing with essentially the same misadventures at sea (continuing right where the original ended), the arc here feels more like the big budget, high seas extravaganza the franchise wants to be. Of course the over-utilized Orlando Bloom does not help make things any easier on us, especially when asked to accept Mr. Bloom as the heroic savior certain scenes wish to implement, of which the boyish actor simply does not have the gravity to convey. Despite less focus being on the actual characters, helping to fill out the script are the budding moral conflicts arising in these main protagonists , giving the fun affair an extra shade of dimension not present in the original's straight-forward presentations. All in all, if you liked the original you should most likely enjoy the sequel. Where many have disappointingly pointed out the lack of personality and indulgence of set action pieces that Dead Man's Chest sinks to in place of authentic and rousing pirate personalities prominently portrayed in Curse of the Black Pearl, I would argue that POTC:DMC knew what it was even more then it's predecessor, and for that created a more cohesive, engaging adventure that does well to set up anticipation for it's forthcoming last round."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","0","0","26 November 2006"," My diagnosis is blockbuster-sequelitis
","I can impossibly outline the plot of Dead Man's Chest so I will just say that the story centres around finding the titular object with all the detours and diversions that this quest entails. Owing to these, the film is a chaotic extravaganza, puffed full of story lines, and camp as a row of tents. It scores higher with me than the original did simply because this adventure knows how ridiculous it is and how much it suffers from blockbuster-sequelitis  and Gore Verbinski makes no pretense about it. The result is fun, big, bigger, epic. <br/><br/>Although I never saw Dead Man's Chest in the theatre, I can easily imagine what the atmosphere must have been like during the premiere week. The responsive contingent of tittering and giggling teenage girls must surely have elevated it about generic adventure movie formula. What's more is that the vivid CGI extravaganza of special effects not only merits a big screen, but demands it for the optimal experience. Dark City/The Crow cinematographer Dariusz Wolski takes a big gulp out of the lush murky jungles and the epic marine battles, creating an unspeakably captivating setting through aerial shots. There are two aspects that follow Wolski's style: polite nods to horror and shots so dark you can hardly make out the action. Nevertheless the cinematography is arguably one of Dead Man's Chest's goldmines.<br/><br/>Conversely, the acting side of the tapestry is wristslashingly poor. This is quite a feat when employing the skills of Geoffrey Rush, Bill Nighy, Stellan Skarsgård and Johnny Depp  so kudos on that. I don't suspect I need to comment on Bloom and Keira, but let me debunk the myth that Johnny Depp gives a good performance as Jack Sparrow. If unforgivably over-the-top and staged is your cup of tea then maybe you will enjoy his style of acting. In fact Depp displays the theatrics a high school drama student would resort to in the annual Christmas play. Perhaps Jack Davenport who reprises his role as Norrington is the light of the film. For one, he no longer looks like a Popsicle, but a scruffy, rugged pirate. Yarr! The backlot backstabbing that goes on in the triumvirate of Depp, Davenport and Bloom proves inexplicably entertaining at times.<br/><br/>But the script is one big sketchbook mess. It is the type of thing that a 12-year-old boy would conjure up whilst scribbling down a few ideas in math class. Dead Man's Chest is bursting with the flair, comedy, fantasy, action, horror and (backseated) romance of an impatient author. Even if you are a token Disney dog you will get your own storyline. This tells me someone in charge just needs to pause for a second and reconsider serious condensation storywise  lose a few characters. Another fatal flaw in the script stage is the laziness that it applies to crafting its characters. It becomes apparent within minutes of the film that it relies solely on Jack Sparrow for comedy  and worst of all, it does not even bother to give him good lines or situations, but expect the audience to find the mere facial expressions of Depp 'hysterical'. If you are a fawning fangirl you probably will.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a dizzyingly fast paced and complex film (it gets so complex that at one point there is a pause and a comedic sidekick gets to explain the plot to the audience) with numerous layers, except when it comes to its one-dimensional characters. Some of these prove quite smirkworthy with their assigned quirks and undoubtedly little time is left to reflect on the quality of the whole spectacle. Even remotely 'serious' scenes are interrupted by pratfalls or whacked-out action sequences that boldly transcend the boundaries of logic (rolling wheel and rolling ball comes to mind). The good news is that amidst the fast-paced navigation of the marine action world, time is a non-issue. 150 minutes? Feels like 90. <br/><br/>Still, if you want perfect adventure camp I highly recommend The Mummy (1999).<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

I came out, sick to my stomach. The storyline was great, but the darkness of this film left me with a sick stomach. Davy Jones looked good, but his evil character was too over the top. The scenes on Davy Jones' boat were gross, with all the sea creature humans doing hard labor and getting whipped. The opening scene with Jack Sparrow was also quite troubling, at the Pirate Prison. Seeing men being tortured, eaten by crows, and dragged off screaming is not my cup of tea when I'm expecting a fun-filled Pirates Of The Caribbean adventure. Jack Sparrow leaves you feeling unsatisfied with his wit, when you compare it to the first movie. The good thing, however, is that the ending leaves you with a hope of the next movie being much, much better."

It would be very hard to follow that up and while watching this film I wondered, did they try to hard? This film starts with the apparently ruined wedding of Elizabeth and Will. We are never really told why it is not really happening, though it is an out door wedding and it is raining. While we observe Elizabeth on the ground apparently in grief some officers show up and arrest her and Will for helping Jack in the last film. They then convince Will to go to Jack so that they can collect jack and his strange compass.<br/><br/>Sounds like a good plot and things sound even more interesting when you learn that Jack owes Davey Jones (not from the Monkees) his soul for allowing Jack to capn the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>The acting was again amazing as were the FX in the film. The cast of soul captured pirates who serve Davey Jones look amazing and some what smelly. THe problem I found with this film, and I hope the next will fix, is that it was a lot like the first in plot but lacked the imagination and pace of the first.<br/><br/>I found my self watching many useless scenes in which nothing was served except to make the film well over two hours (the fight in the bar when we meet the now bum like Norrington served nothing for the film at all and was so boring). We do get to see many of the old characters in great light and hear many well written references to the first but they get lost among useless and drawn out film.<br/><br/>There were other plot tools I found some what dumb as well. The romantic triangle between Elizabeth, Jack, and Will was painful and did not seem honest to any of their characters (at least Elizabeths and Jacks).<br/><br/>This film did have many fun parts in it and was good and all but was not great or fantastic. I found myself wishing they had left out much of it and explained other smaller things (I got some being a history buff and all but found some others wondering about them), like who are the bad guys after Jacks compass, who is Davey Jones, w2here did the two funny British soldiers go (man I missed them).<br/><br/>Like I started off saying, this film may end up better when the last one is out and I can put lots of stuff together. I hope that next one does not drag however and allows us to return to the magic of the first Pirates movie."

","This was a good film basically but they have tried to cram to much into the film. Not a patch on the 1st. Again Johny Depp is excellent in it, again great special effects. This was not ""pirates 2"" but ""laughs with Jack Sparrow."" Comedy pretty good (a fair amount of jokes from the 1st one). Adventure/action was taken to far. they have tried to cram in so many action and adventure scenarios that it spoils a large part of the movie. The following scene is always some what predictable. Buy it on DVD, don't waste your money at the cinema. I wish I had not read pirates 3 before seeing this movie, may have enjoyed it more. Do not read IMDb's details on pirates 3 if you have not seen this movie, that review gives away the story and ending to Pirates 2."
"manbosquez","7","0","0","9 July 2006"," I remember this
","First let me say I thought the movie was great. In fact I thought it was better than the first movie. I thought the film was able to walk the thin line between super action/adventure and comedy without going overboard (pardon the pun.) I did however in the middle of the movie forget that I was not watching Indiana Jones as big round objects seemed to always be rolling down hills, but at the end of the movie when they left us with an open door to the next installments I thought....haven't I been thru that door already? Wasn't there another set of movies that had the second installment end on bleak circumstances just like this? A movie that had a group of friends including a young adventurous man with an absent father who left for dark adventures...a young female love interest that sheds her formal upbringing to show a tough independent woman....and they are apparently headed to save their friend who has been captured and practically dead. Now Captain Jack is not frozen like Captain Solo (oops there is another similarity) but he is in need of saving and it is not sure what state he is in. If you think those are not enough coincidences here is one more...or maybe I should say 2 more. The 2 companions that seem to always be bumbling along with the stories to provide comic relief one of them short and round and the other tall and skinny....in fact the tall skinny pirate that is like C3PO even falls apart (eye popping out) like C3PO found him self often not fully assembled. I know these guys use swords and not light sabers,but did anyone else notice the copied formula?"
"tevans58","7","0","0","9 July 2006"," Fun, long, not as fresh as the first...
","I give this movie a B. I thought it was good, but seemed a bit too long. Too much reliance on CGI, and seemed down right slow at times. I think this was due to so much action that you get numb to it after a bit. Depp's performance was a bit over the top, but the rest of the cast, especially the two pirates that seemed to follow everyone around, made up for it.<br/><br/>It's a fun movie, and worth watching, but I'd have been happy waiting for it to come out on DVD.. My movie going experience may have been colored by the crowded theater, crying children, and endless commercials. Also the people who show up as the movie is starting, wandering the aisles looking for seats for their 12 person entourage.<br/><br/>I will purchase the DVD when it becomes available and watch this again, right after the Black Pearl."

","I won't ruin any specific plot surprises, but beware: this is a very different movie when compared with the first ""Pirates...Black Pearl"" movie. It's much darker. The bad guys this time offer no comic relief, and have gotten more nightmarishly gruesome. (The special effect are spectacular -- almost TOO good!) There is more moral ambiguity, as major, likable characters make tough decisions that won't always sit well.<br/><br/>I DID like it -- but only after I could switch gears and expectations. Those who don't want their ""Pirates"" world rattled may prefer to watch the Black Pearl over and over instead. OR should wait to see what happens to the yarn when part three comes out, so that they can watch part two and immediately follow it with part three.<br/><br/>Of course, Johnny Depp and crew were amazing! No disappointments there!! This one more than earns it's PG-13 rating."
"zetes","9","3","8","17 July 2006"," Surprisingly great given what I had heard
","It boggles my mind how down the critics were on this. It's at the same level as the first one, which everyone seemed to love. Yes, there are some things to complain about, mostly that there's just way too much going on. Characters from the first one that, if you last saw it when it was in the theaters (as I did), you won't remember pop up at regular intervals. There are several separate plot lines going on at the same time, and once in a while one character will be away on his or her own adventure for a long time and then come back to the main plot line without explaining where they've been or what they've been doing, and requiring no explanation for what has happened with all the other characters. But, really, so what? There's more than enough exposition elsewhere, and as long as the audience understands what's going on, it doesn't matter too much. The story may be overcomplicated, but it's generally very good. The bottom line is that the movie is a hell of a lot of fun. Of all the movies this summer, this is the one that doesn't disappoint at all. It's a thousand times better than Superman, that's for sure. Where Superman was slow and dull and ponderous, Pirates' action never stops (which I'm sure will annoy some) and it doesn't aspire to be anything more than a really fun ride. There're a lot of cool monsters, too. If you liked the first one, definitely don't miss this while it's still on the big screen."

And of course Johnny Depp when he's best!<br/><br/>The script fits Depp perfectly and the degree of ""Sparrow madness"" seems to know no boundaries. <br/><br/>All in all I think its better than the first installment, but after this screening, even the original became a better movie!<br/><br/>Prepare to be taken back to your childhood!

"MovieDude1893","8","3","8","16 July 2006"," It's the best damn setup money can buy!
","'Dead Man's Chest' is one of the years best and most exhilarating blockbusters. A bustling entertainment, pure and simple. The plot is, in the most simplistic terms, not the point. Like a Dashiell Hammett novel it's all about the aura and dialogue. Not to mention characters, trust me the film has MANY of those.<br/><br/>But, I'll attempt a brief plot summary. Jack Sparrow owes a debt to the ultra- heavy of the sea, Davy Jones... the payment... his soul, well that or 100 other souls. To slight Davy Jones Jack gets assistance from Will Turner. Little does Jack know Will and his fiancé Elizabeth are being hunted for helping Sparrow, a known pirate escape a grizzly fate. The only way of achieving freedom is retrieving Jack's compass for the evil Lord Beckett. Will gets involved for more than he bargained for and has to battle against Jones at Sparrow's side.<br/><br/>Acting wise 'Chest' has nearly no rough patches. Depp brings undeniable comedic energy to Sparrow and though un-recognizable physically, Nighy's Jones is a wonderful villain. Plus, Bloom has seemingly improved since the first outing.<br/><br/>The effects are dazzling but that goes without saying. As to the detractors who complain the entire film is setup for number three, I tell you this: It's the best damn setup money can buy!"

","We all know that when a ""sequel"" appears, we don't expect much but this is one of those that is quite good. It had the perfect blend of action, romance, locals and CGI that was scary and wonderful at the same time.<br/><br/>What you'll like about this is that the characters you knew and loved from the first 'Pirates' are all back - with more demons of their own to face. Of course, the main character - Captain Jack Sparrow is still up to his Pirate-ty ways ad you've gotta love him for it. And just when you think Elizabeth and Turner were going to live happily ever after - a regime change - changes all of that. And so the story goes and it goes so well! The star of this film is a mixture of CGI, action and adventure. As a big horror film fan, I've gotta tell you...all those condemned to Davy Jones' crew are scary as heck. Don't take your kids who get scared at creepy crawly things PG-13 means PG-13 here and there are a lot of creepy crawly things continuing to creep and crawl. I loved it! This film is a second film that sets you up for a third and in leaving the theater all I heard was ""I wanta see the 3rd one now!"" This is movie that was a lot of fun and the end was the best.<br/><br/>Go see it. Twice!"
"Elswet","9","3","8","12 July 2006"," Darker story delivers a superior adventure...
","In reading the reviews written by the ""professional"" critics prior to my initial viewing of this work, I entered the theater with greatly lessened expectations. I must say that I owe those naysayers a vote of thanks, as I was so anticipating this work, that it had no way of fulfilling my hopes. Thanks to their dire condemnations and overly enthusiastic tongue-clicking, I had a marvelous and unexpectedly thrilling movie-going experience.<br/><br/>The best most well-done element of this movie? The WHOLE movie! I'm serious. There wasn't a moment of wasted film, there wasn't even one time when I was wondering what time it was, and there wasn't a single performance which was found lacking in any way. This was a 3 hour film which felt like it was over too soon. And, if you've been one of the millions of fans who have kept up with this work through its production, then you also know the original cast is back, including the nefarious Barbossa (NOT a spoiler, he's listed in the credits), in addition to an entire cast of new characters, thrilling action, mahogany storyline, superior sound, and stellar awards-quality effects.<br/><br/>The Verbinski/Bruckheimer marriage seems to be a good one; a profitable one, but more importantly, a creative one. The story incorporates each and every element of a successful well-loved classic. There is romance, action, adventure, horror, fantasy, monsters, pirates, chases, betrayals, escapes, treacheries and deceits, honesty, and love. All set before breathtaking vistas, and finished with completely realistic, top quality effects.<br/><br/>With the benefit of virtually no time taken to redevelop the principal characters, the story kicks in from the beginning, and the character development is devoted to the new cast of characters. What a twisted darkling lot they are!<br/><br/>Make sure you stay for the bonus scene after end credits!<br/><br/>I was most impressed with this work, and rate it slightly above the original for its story and a slightly superior adventure experience, at an 8.9/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."

I almost left, but I didn't want to be disrespectful to the person who purchased my ticket. I went with a group of six, ages ranging from 15-40 and everyone i was with didn't like it.

"wolfbeem","2","3","8","8 July 2006"," HUGE Mistake
","I, like many fans of the original film, had anticipated this feature for three years, since the picture was first announced. Standing in line for an hour, I was the first in my area to receive tickets to the midnight preview of the show. The theater was filled with devoted fans in costume. My, how we have been disappointed. The producers of the film, apparently only wanting to rake in the cash, have created a plot less, listless, carbon copy of the original film, which might have been a classic had it not been overshadowed by this certain failure. Pointless adventures, overblown special effects, and forced humor are rampant in the film. Worst of all, irritated fans who have waited two and a half hours for the film's conclusion must now wait another year before the many cliff hangers will be resolved. Jack Sparrow, originally a witty and lovable pirate, has become a villainous, sex-crazed scallywag with no perceivable humor. Depp cannot be blamed; it seems the script was cranked out of a Pirates of the Caribbean factory, where identical plots are slightly masked by new (and less intriguing) characters. All I can say is: perhaps Barbossa can save number three. He seems to be the only fun character left, as the others have been drained of any entertaining or honorable qualities (this doesn't includes Will's now-dull romantic dramas). And, finally, where have all these random histories come from? And what is the purpose of so many strange ancient civilizations? So many plot lines will shoot out of nowhere and go nowhere from thence, it is truly mind-boggling. Writers, I for one am sorely disappointed, and rather angry. In earnest, I feel that we devoted fans are owed an apology."

The characters were just average, no true development. I just feel like I should have seen it at the dollar theater!!! Maybe if they would have cut out some of the useless fighting senses then it would have been better. Some senses go one for ever even though there is no point to them. When I talked to friends people said they didn't like it. BUt now I have to see part 3 just to see how it ends. Walt Dinsey made a wise move there. The kissing sense were worth the wait. Johnny did do a great job playing captain jack, but Orlando bloom was just average. Kira Knightingly was hotter then ever."
"dunasmelly","7","3","8","6 July 2006"," Good, but it's no Black Pearl...
","I must say I'm quite torn in regards to my feelings on this movie, and I'll explain why. The movie has equally good and bad points, and although the good outweighs the bad, the film as a whole feels quite odd. On the one hand the movie had a lot to live up to, the first movie was great. Great characters, great action set pieces, great villains, and great humor. So dead mans chest, like all blockbuster sequels had to try and out-do everything about the first film and in the end, that is it's greatest weakness. It feels like a popcorn movie in parts, but too often it is way too serious. It's entertaining when the action hits, but again, for a popcorn movie, it's too frigging long.<br/><br/>Most of the cast from the first film returns and they are just as good this time around (except when they double dip on jokes which usually gets more of a sigh than a laugh). Jack Sparrow is funny as always, but it's getting harder for the character to carry the film, since there isn't much more to him than there was in the first. Normally I wouldn't mind with a popcorn movie but a lot of scenes in this one are darker, and his character is a tad too silly to fit in to them. Will Turner gets the most interesting story, and Elizabeth Swan gets, well the background really.<br/><br/>As for the villains, they are possibly the movies greatest downfall. Davey Jones is not an intimidating character, and his crew of sea creature folk have little or no character. Full props to Bill Nighy for creating an interesting character out of nothing, but in the end he simply doesn't live up to the charm and menace that Geoffory rush brought to the first movie. The real villain of the piece is the Krakken and once that thing gets going, you know sh*t is going to hit the fan.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole isn't all that bad, it's certainly better than most blockbuster flicks, and would work a lot better on it's own but following on from the first film it's just a slight let down. It could easily lose the first half hour as it's really forgettable. There's a side story involving, well I wont give it away but you'll know when you see it that it's really not interesting in the least. The general feel of the film also feels too broken up, there really isn't a proper flow to any of the proceedings and often, the story just feels like a mixture of cool ideas, but without one story to tie them all together properly.<br/><br/>The movie does have high points, scenes which really make it worth seeing, but it's a case of too little, too late as they mostly occur much later in the movie. These include the 3 way sword fight on a giant rolling wheel, the Krakken scene, and the rather hilarious chase for the titular chest. Special note must also go to the special effects which are, simply put, the most believable CG shots ever put on film. The CG characters that reside on the Flying Dutchman (Davey Jones ship) and Davey Jones himself are so believable, you wont even find yourself thinking they aren't real.<br/><br/>So, in the end, it's a fun ride (more so in the second half) with all the great character returning from the first, only hampered by slightly weak villains, a ridiculously long run-time, and a weaker story. The action is fun on a bun, and the twist at the end certainly brought a smile to my face. I can only hope the third film is slightly better and more fun.<br/><br/>3.5 out of 5"

","Cap'n Jack Sparrow returns to walk around drunkenly and make the requisite one liners, along with almost everyone from the first POTC (even the midget!). What you end up with is a pretty good swashbuckler that runs a little too long.<br/><br/>I just saw the midnight show and I have to say that it was pretty good. Not as good as the first but still enjoyable. But then again, I went into the first POTC thinking I was about to see a crap-filled diaper of a movie and came out pleasantly surprised. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved Davy Jones in this. To think that they achieved his look without any makeup is mind boggling. CGI effects are getting frighteningly photorealistic and Davy Jones character is unbelievably well done. <br/><br/>The movie is funny and the story, while a tad complicated, is not too hard to follow. There are a lot of different characters in this, both good and bad and it will be interesting to see how their story lines will be resolved. I loved the constant references to the first and I suggest watching the first before watching this, just to be completely refreshed. The special effects are well realized and the scenes with the Kraken are pretty wild. The movie has a ton of action with one really cool three way swordfight on a rolling wheel. <br/><br/>Depp is pretty funny but his character seems to have lost a little bit of the charm he had in the first POTC. He's still the main thing to see in this show but this time around, I sincerely doubt he'll be getting another Oscar nomination for Cap'n Jack. Keira Knightley is gorgeous as always and Orlando Bloom does what is required of him. Other standouts include Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma and the crew of the Flying Dutchman who are just outright nasty. There's an awesome cameo at the end of the film that I won't spoil but the audience cheered when they showed up.<br/><br/>I'd have to say that this movie was pretty good but nothing to write home to Mom about. It was a little underwhelming, even for such a massive production. I think the length is the one thing about this movie that kind of hurts it. There was a lot of stuff at the beginning that felt needless and maybe could have been trimmed. I do want to see the third installment and Dead Man's Chest does have that Empire Strikes Back cliffhanger thing going for it, so I guess it did something right. The bit after the credits was really funny also.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp fans should be satisfied, at least.<br/><br/>RATING: ***1/2 out of *****."

","I was very disappointed with this movie, I was so excited to see it, but it fell up short to my expectations. I really liked the first film but this one just felt like it didn't live up to it's reputation from the first film. First would be the acting which was a C- at best, you have Johnny who is an outstanding actor, but Orlando Bloom doesn't give enough emotion to make his character believable, and as for Kiera, she's pretty average especially here. Then would be the already complex plot which goes from epic to disastrous in an hour by being so incredibly confusing and just boring at times because you're just lost! But then when you do finally realize whats going on, it still doesn't sell...<br/><br/>So in all, this movie has pretty average acting, great plot which takes a turn for the worse, and amazing special effects.

One reason is Johnny Depp i hate him worst actor in Hollywood people like Eric Bana deserve his fame.

An other reason is they got rid of Black Pearls director and replaced him with Gore Verbinski who couldn't have done it worst. He just couldn't do anything right like the scene when Depp is chained to the deck of his ship and the big monster thing is going to eat him when Depp steps out with his sword and you see this big monster with the worst effects in a modern film appear i had too laugh it was so fake(in effects terms).<br/><br/>There was just too many things going on like Orlando has too save his wife or whatever. So he needs Jack's compass then Jack who is looking for a box with a heart.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest does a fantastic job of doing the duty of a sequel. The humor in Pirates II was a lot more enjoyable. Though some people found how it ended oddly, I would say that it was an excellent lead-in to Pirates III. Everyone from the original cast is back, including Norrington and Governor Swann. We are also introduced to some new faces such as Will Turner's father, Bootstrap Bill, and Davy Jones himself. If you noticed in the first Pirates movie, The Curse Of The Black Pearl, you would notice that the movie ended happily, as if there was no intention of creating sequels to it. This one, however, cuts off the end. I personally enjoyed being left hanging, because It gives me (the viewer) the assurance to know that the story is yet to be over. I cannot wait to see how this turns out in Pirates III, and Dead Mans Chest is a movie that the whole family can enjoy."

","I saw Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest last night. I've had the DVD at home for about a week from Netflix and I finally got around to watching it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first movie (as most people did) and was surprised by how entertaining it was given its source material (as most people were). So, while I wouldn't say I had high hopes for the sequel (didn't think it was necessary), I was looking forward to some more Captain Jack Sparrow and top-of-the-line special effects (I felt the original movie's effects were the most impressive to date).<br/><br/>Wow, a lot of parentheses in that last paragraph.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was entertaining, although not as good as the original. The story was hard to follow, the first 45 minutes were completely unnecessary and did nothing to move the plot forward and overall it was probably about ½ an hour too long. Actually just remove those first 45 minutes and it would have flowed much better and been a better flick.<br/><br/>But we must remember that these Pirates films are about having fun, and when the film gets going, it is just that: fun.<br/><br/>The cinematography, sets, costumes, audio, effects and acting are all top notch. Everything looks fantastic. Johnny Depp again reprises his role as Captain Jack Sparrow to perfection. Maybe some of the magic is gone, since it is not as new or fresh, but you can't blame Johnny for that.<br/><br/>I'm not going to bother with plot details, but I will say this. The folks at ILM have done it again. They've topped their previous effort and again delivered a special effects tour de force! The main antagonist, the pirate Davy Jones, a half man/half octopus creature is simply the most impressive visual effect ever put on film. Ever. He was created completely out of CG, overlaid over the actor playing him, and it is so convincing it looked like the actor was wearing a prosthetic mask. Only you know it couldn't be a prosthetic because if it was, it was the most convincing, organic looking prosthetic in history. The texture of his skin, his tentacles, the way the lighting would reflect off of him (in either night, rain or sunshine) was absolutely perfect. I can watch the scenes in which Davy Jones are in over and over and not get tired. They did a simply amazing job.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the film, rent it just for Johnny Depp and Davy Jones. They are both worth the extra long run time, the so-so beginning, and at times convoluted story."
"Workin_Man","10","2","5","25 December 2006"," Hard to believe, but it actually was better than the first!!
","First of all, I gotta say that I have nothing against the first ""Pirates"" movie. I thought it was an instant classic. A very fun and enjoyable movie. One of the best movies of 2003 in my view. However, I believe that Dead Man's Chest was a better movie than the first, and I'll tell you why: <br/><br/>1) More action scenes - Sure, the first movie had quite a bit of action, but this movie was packed with it! It had me on my toes the entire 2 and a half hours! <br/><br/>2) Sword-fighting scenes - Again, in the first movie there were many and all were very well done. However, in Dead Man's Chest, there were a good amount and I must say, the choreography was excellent! There was so many things going on at once that it was difficult to keep up! <br/><br/>3) Special effects - The digital effects in this film were astonishing! Everything from the make-up effects (Davy Jones in particular) to the Krakken to the ships. An amazing job by the effects crew. They deserve more credit! <br/><br/>All in all, POTC: Dead Man's Chest was a truly great film. The absolute best movie of 2006 in my view. So obviously I recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the ""Pirates"" series and also to non-fans alike. I know you will enjoy this movie and appreciate all the hard work the cast and crew put into it to make it the movie that it is. An amazing film.<br/><br/>10/10"

If you liked the first movie ""the Curse of the Black Pearl"" you'll definitely enjoy this spectacular sequel; if you haven't seen yet the first movie DO NOT WATCH this second! You'll understand nothing about the story of Jack Sparrow and the other characters. The acting is perfect, especially Johnny Depp is simply great acting in the role of the pirate Jack Sparrow. He's already one icon, a perfect character developed by himself, and he's truly great! The special effects are huge as always, and i liked the octopus-beard of Davy Jones and the sea-damned crew. The music, the pace of the movie and the story developed over the first movie, these are all pieces of the same machine that make ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a marvelous saga for everyone. Remember that this is the second chapter of a trilogy, a trilogy filled with pirate magic, a trilogy that will become famous as the ""Lord of the rings"" trilogy. Those who don't appreciate this ""piratesque"" thrill-ride don't understand the magic of those wonderful movies. Period."

And Johnny's performance deserves the academy award, Pirates of the Caribbean would have never been the same without him, not even close... And his jokes are so much funnier in DMC. And most importantly the movie its not predictable at all, it has an ending that will leave you confused... This one balances comedy from almost all non-evil characters of the movie, except for Jack who actually seems to use cocky comedy in an unconscious way."

","I loved this movie. It was interesting and fun. I have seen it four times and could go out of the theater after seeing it again and subconsciously be doing the Captain Jack Sparrow walk. The actors and actress did wonderfully. I will say on the minus side of things that I did feel like it was drug out a little but thats is OK. And its OK about Jack dying in the end because you know he will be back, and when he does come back it will be awesome grand entrance! My friend was really mad about the ending and I was a little upset about it but I think I would be even more upset if they did not make another one. I am glad there will be a third and I have heard talks of fourth and even a fifth, as long as they keep up with good, interesting ideas I am happy for it to keep going, it isn't like they don't have the money for it."

Pirates has a better story and I bet it will get the best special effects of the year award. It has a MAGNIFICENT ending. I won't give it away. It really makes me want to see Pirates of the Caribbean 3: at World's End. I bet it will be bigger and better than Pirates of the Caribbean 2. Maybe not. But I think At World End's will be as good. I can't wait until the new Spider man 3, Fantastic Four 2, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Elf 2, and the Pirates trailer is out. As I said, Dead Man's chest is the best movie of my life.

","I thought this movie was well put together, and the special effects and makeup departments overachieved the success from the first film. Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom made an exciting comeback since the Curse of the Black Pearl. Overall, I think this movie beat the first one in every category except the storyline. It's hard to match the Curse of the Black Pearls's storyline success. Overall Rating= 10.0 Actor's/Actresses=10.0 Director=9.5 Special Effects=10.0 (Exceeds Expectations!) Storyline=9.0 Makeup\costumes=10.0 Dialogue=9.5 This movie beats the first one by a slight margin. The only areas that don't beat the first are directing, dialogue, and storyline (which are all still amazing.)"

","Wow I loved this film and although i felt it wasn't as good as the first, it was pretty fantastic! And it had a tough act to follow seeing as the 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl' was just amazing. I felt that the plot was gripping and it was acted very well. Johnny Depp is even more good looking as Captain Jack Sparrow! (If that is possible.) I also felt that Bill Nighy was excellent as Davy Jones and he played his character with great ability. Still, I felt that Johnny Depp's acting blew me away once more with his unique gift of playing Captain Jack Sparrow so well. He led the film and made it one of the best I've ever seen."
"vikingvampireparrot","10","2","5","31 August 2006"," Brilliant - want no. 3 NOW
","Dead Man's Chest is a great film. Now, admittedly, it is not up to Curse of the Black Pearl standard but it is still a 10/10 film in its own right. Maybe if we were talking out of 100 Curse's edge could be shown in the rating.<br/><br/>I think the main place that DMC falls down is that it is TOO funny. CoBP was very dark - Sparrow had been written as a straight character and then was played comically. In contrast, Sparrow has been written as a comedic role in DMC and this makes him a bit OTT on the funny stakes and it does feel a tiny bit forced at times. But essentially this is more of the same adventure and fantasy.<br/><br/>However, this is still an excellent film with brilliant performances all round - the development of Will and Norrington stand out as the main growth/change in character.<br/><br/>The ending is frustrating - but only because you want to see what happens in part 3. Here's hoping it carries on in the same fashion and keeps the high standard."

The first time i watched it with my whole family and when i say whole i mean whole (mother, father, brother, uncle, aunt and my two cousins)and they totally destroyed the pleasure of seeing Jack Sparrow...sorry Captain Jack Sparrow in his latest adventure because they kept making hard comments about it just because they couldn't cope with the story (Which i found easy to understand). So i went to see it again, alone this time. I usually don't like sequels but i liked Pirates of the Caribbean The Dead Man's Chest a lot. it is a lot different from the first film and it focuses on Will's love and devotion.

Pay twice for the same movie, but not the same, in this case it have a role character, Jack Sparraw and others, maybe a good name could be 'Pirates of Carribbean Sea, Sparraw & co'. Another problem in Hollywood movies came back, if i pay for my ticket, please do a 1 1/1 hour movie, 2 hours in an adventure movie is very risky and only good directors can do it (Verbinski is a common director, not bad, not good). Disney hand appears in Pirates 2, Pirate is reliable person?, maybe Disney could change the character of a Pirate by a nun in Pirates 3."

I was hearing that it is quite long but I didn't have the impression. the first one definitely felt longer. the acting was great, though the best one was yet again Johnny Depp, his presence wasn't as strong as in the first movie thanks to bigger concentration on the sidekicks - I especially appreciated Ragetti and Pintel. Elizabeth had definitely a bigger part and Stelan Skarsgard was just incredible. I didn't recognize Bill Nighy but his performance was flawless as always. Orlando was great - I especially liked his eyes, but didn't have a lot of space. the tricks are incredible and unbelievable. much better then in the first one - there is definitely more of them. the plot is not bad either and the fun is still there - so much of it, especially concerning the rum :) but what I probably liked the most is the music. it is a work of genius. it suited the film perfectly. applause to Hans Zimmer.

The Effects are tremendous and live up too the reputation that Disney has set up for this franchise. I particularly enjoyed dead mans chest for the real old fashioned good pirate story in the flick. <br/><br/>In Particular I enjoyed the performance of Bill Nighy under the tentacle adorned Davy Jones. <br/><br/>The film is a little long in the tooth at 2 1/2 hours but is worth every minute, the actors here are the film , and to think that Disney exec's were terrified when they saw how Depp portrayed Jack Sparrow ... I think the real scary part of that is those exec's all still have jobs ... this was a truly inspired performance . <br/><br/>Rumour has it we will be seeing the mentor of that performance in the third installment very soon ...

Many of scenes, in fact, did remind me much more of Disney kiddy rides than movie magic. There was no interesting story line, no new interesting charactersa, no further development of the characters we'd met before.<br/><br/>It was boring and contrived, but Disney got my money and I suspect that is all this film was intended to accomplish."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest picks up 3 years after the first film. Will and Elizabeth's wedding is halted when they are both arrested for aiding Jack Sparrow in his hunt for the Black Pearl. Will is offered a pardon if he can find Jack Sparrow and retrieve his magical compass. He finds Jack running in fear of Davy Jones, whom he owes his soul. Jack and Will are joined by Elizabeth, who has escaped capture, to find the heart of Davy Jones and destroy it. Dead Man's Chest is far more action packed than the original film, but it is a darker, more serious film.<br/><br/>Everything that was good about the first movie is good in this film. Once again, Johnny Depp is hysterical as Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando Bloom does very well returning as Will Turner. The dialogue is just as witty and cool as before. Some parents might not like that this film is darker than the first. Some scenes might even be considered frightening. The character of Davy Jones and his crew aboard the Flying Dutchman are amazing. The CGI in this movie is quite possibly the best special effects I've seen in a movie recently. One of the only problems I had with the movie was the character of Elizabeth Swann. She has changed from the first film. Keira Knightley's performance was just as good, but her character is strongly downplayed. She doesn't have a lot to do with the movie. I personally enjoyed this movie just as much as the first film, but some people may not like the fact that this movie ends in a complete cliffhanger, due to the fact that this was filmed at the same time as the third film. Nothing is resolved at the end, because it's all going to end in the third film.<br/><br/>The acting is just as good as the first time around. As for new characters, Bill Nighy is amazing as Davy Jones, even though his face is completely covered by CGI effects. Stellan Skarsgard is great as Will Turner's ghostly father, Bootstrap Bill.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an awesome sequel, and the third film promises to be even more amazing.<br/><br/>8/10"
"dumbnOOb27","3","2","5","1 August 2006"," Campy, overdone, and, worst of all, boring--exactly why is Captain Jack sexy?
","I'm a teenage girl, and frankly, I really can't see what my peers see in Johnny Depp. I'm no homophobe, but how can a girl find a mincing alcoholic wearing eyeliner sexy? It's as if he played the role so gay that it went over their heads. I'm not saying that Johnny Depp isn't a decent actor, and it's his artistic choice if he feels Captain Jack should be played as homosexual, but I still don't see why anyone female would find him sexy. I can suspend my disbelief, I like Indiana Jones and everything, but I actually laughed at the more unbelievable sequences. Also, as a 3D artist, I marveled at Davey Jones' tentacles. They were absolutely perfect. But the Kraken was patchy at best. Yes, none of this pertains to the plot. To which I respond--what plot? Now, before you write me off as someone who didn't pay attention, I paid a lot of attention to the setup. I understand what's going on. Really, I do. But far too much of this movie had the holes in the plot filled by magic and special effects: the magic compass, the key to the chest that holds the magical heart of Davey Jones, and the magical ship with its hallucinatory crew. I admire the new mo-cap system and all the trouble taken by the VFX team and can sympathize with them, but they went way too far for such a campy movie as this. A question brought up by this movie which I doubt will be fully resolved in the next is: Where exactly is Captain Jack's soul? Logically, it should have gone to Davey Jones when he died. Why, then, must the others go to ""the ends of the earth""--a seeming metaphor for the otherworld--to retrieve it? Also, why was Captain Jack unfazed by the thought of dying? If he had no outside assurance that he was to be resurrected, then something like this would have been going through his mind: ""Well, my buddy Will just almost killed me in a swordfight, my crew mutinied against me, and my potential girlfriend just as good as killed me, but I think I'll die happy, safe in the knowledge that all these good people will be eager to bring me back from the dead."" If, on the other hand, he did have outside assurance that he would be resurrected, namely, the items that he stole from Tia Dalma (which she does not know about), then wouldn't Liz, Will, and the gang's quest to retrieve him from the otherworld be pointless? They would arrive at the otherworld, only to find that Jack had already resurrected himself by other means. Now that's a nice how-d'you-do for them! Overall, my first thought after leaving the theatre was, ""I thought camp went out with the '70s!"" No matter how much elaborate CG was layered over the fantastic creatures and lack of a plot, the inner camp shines through bright and clear. And that's what mattered."

","Looking at the box office collections this movie made in the first 2-3 weeks after release, i was sure this movie is better than The curse of the Black Pearl. But after seeing the movie i was really disappointed. The fast paced, smooth moving story and action in the first movie is not present in this one. The movie is plagued with a weak plot, storyline or whatever you want to call it. There is the attempt at comedy with Captain Sparrow and his crew getting caught by the cannibals. This was totally unnecessary and we could have done well without it. And the crew of The Flying Dutchman could have been more scarier and intimidating than was portrayed. There is no continuation of the story line from The curse of the Black Pearl, but after watching this movie one has to watch the third part. Hope that will be better than this."

I dunno why but I kept getting the feeling that Johnny Depp was almost over acting, and was trying too hard to be like Jack Sparrow from the first movie. He seemed like he was pushing too hard on the funny witty comments that made him brilliant in the first one. Also I didn't like the ending. It ended so abruptly but I do have to say it made me want to see the next one."
"Derek237","6","2","5","30 July 2006"," Based on a theme park ride, and feels like one
","I came out of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest with an empty feeling. It leaves on a major cliffhanger, and instead of feeling excited and anxious to see what happens next, like one usually feels with cliffhangers, I felt completely ripped off. I felt like I've seen half a movie. Now, it's not exactly a new trend for guaranteed hit sequels to be filmed simultaneously to create some hackneyed ""trilogy,"" but Dead Man's Chest has got to be the absolute worst example of this method to date. It is all set-up and no payoff whatsoever. We learn so little about the characters that we don't already know. It hints towards an attraction between Elizabeth and Jack, it presents a relationship between Will and his Dad, and in what is probably the only significantly developed character, Norrington, who was once engaged to Elizabeth, has now fallen hard on his luck, become embittered, and resorted to the ways of the pirate. The plot, among many aspects, mainly involves the pursuit of the Dead Man's Chest, hence the title. They find the damn thing but nothing really develops after that. I guess we have to find out what happens in the next one. Great.<br/><br/>What sours me on this movie is that it accomplishes literally nothing. There are no resolutions, just bigger and badder problems that occur. The Matrix Reloaded at least had its own small plot inside its larger plot about Keanu Reeves' character dealing with premonitions of his loved one dying and finally having to face it, and Back to the Future Part II dealt with problems being solved in the future, past, and alternate universes that finally led to one one final time-travel accident that bridged into the concept of the sequel, etc. etc. So what was Dead Man's Chest? Jack is stupid and he has to pay for it? <br/><br/>Dead Man's chest has the action scenes that run way too long and the usual hijinks of the beloved character, Jack Sparrow. What I do really like about this series is that the main characters aren't growing to be best buddies or anything. Usually in the first film the characters conflict and get on each others' nerves but by part 2 they're great friends (a la Star Wars), but it is not so with this trio, mainly because of the unreliability of Jack. They are basically only friends when it is convenient for him. The movie ends with Jack ""dying"" and Will and Elizabeth, along with Jack's crew, mourning him and setting off to find a way to get him back. But, it really wouldn't surprise me if once they do save him in part 3, he'll find some way or another to screw them over. Particularly Will.<br/><br/>I had no respect for the movie but I'll admit it had its fun moments and I thought the visual effects were amazing. Davy Jones (played green-suit style by Bill Nighy) is a really cool creation. Jones and his crew were apparently all CGI, but this was not one of those cases where you role your eyes and think it's so obviously fake. This time, in this movie, I really bought it.<br/><br/>So, what can I really say to sum up Dead Man's Chest? I think it's shameless. And when you think about it, it is exactly- EXACTLY- like a ride in Disneyland. You wait so long in the line (or in this case waiting for the movie to come out), you finally get into it, and by the time it's all over you feel empty and ripped off and need more of it. So, you have to ride it again (or see what happens in part 3), and you have to wait even longer. Terrible! I would say that on the whole, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an okay movie that pales in comparison to the first. Johnny Depp was great, the action scenes were sometimes fun, and the visual effects were top-of-the-line and probably the highlight of the movie for me. It deserves a slap in the face for its script and plot, but an Oscar for its effects.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10"

","I was having a panic attack when I started hearing professional reviews, because all of them seemed fixated on how ""incredibly long"" this movie was. After seeing it three times so far, I am amazed at how SHORT it seems (and this from an adult who still has leftovers from childhood ADHD)! The end was over before I knew it, and not because I fell asleep. There is enough action and a few surprises that I don't think you have to be a die-hard POTC fan to like this film, and Johnny Depp turns in yet another amazing performance that outshines anyone else on screen. Just dress comfortably, go to enjoy, and be sure and stick around until after the credits are completely done!!"

","I Loved Pirates Of The Caribbean:DMC! I waited in line to see it opening day. It was the only movie i have ever, ever done that for. I loved every aspect of it, expect for the ending. Which made me a little mad because now i have to wait until next year to find out what happens to everyone. I saw the first movie at least 20 times and would keep watching it over and over again. I would go back to to the movies to see it again, that is the only movie this year I can say I would go back and see. I would recommend seeing it to everyone! Though it is more graphic than the first one, i still loved it!!! Spend your money and go see it!!!!!!!!!!"
"juldal","10","2","5","27 July 2006"," Action action and more action
","This movie is great, the effects are marvelous, and the story is also good, which i thought would be the problem with this film.<br/><br/>The story is good because it takes another sea/pirate story and puts it too life, everyone heard of the flying dutchman, which makes the story appeal to most people.<br/><br/>We see all the familiar faces from the #1 film the black pearl, and again Johnny Depp is really good, very overacting, but in this role he has to be, also i think that the actor playing davy jones also really plays incredibly good in that part. Again there is a lot of humor in the movie as there should be in a well told tale of the sea, a real pirates story, with amazing creatures and supernatural things.<br/><br/>And the ending leaves every pirate film lover with a real big smile on his face, and just cant wait until # 3 comes, also the casting will include Yun Fat which i will look forward to, and also the return of Rush will be great.<br/><br/>the two not so great performances i think is from Orlando bloom and Kira knightley. bloom doesn't seem to be able to really change his role too much, looking at films like kingdom in heaven, and to a smaller extend LOTR, he just seems to have a lot of those parts in this one, his whole attitude and the way the lines come out.<br/><br/>Kiera knightley just isn't all that good in it either, but i think she will be a very capable actress in time.<br/><br/>The physical stunts however i think that knightley, depp, bloom and davenport are amazing, and give 110% in making of this film.<br/><br/>This is simply the action adventure of the year!!"
"Tom-AVA","10","2","5","27 July 2006"," Unmissable!
","I loved the origonal Pirates of the Caribbean, it was brilliant and i watched it over and over again. I then waited 2/3 years for the second one. When it finally came out i went to see it as soon as i could and i can honestly sat that it truly lived up to the hype..... and then some.<br/><br/>The plot is sort of confusing, i got mixed up with who wanted the treasure for different reasons, but that might be because i went to the toilet half way through. <br/><br/>So Jack is now captain of the Black Pearl and he does all these mental quests in between the first and second film that don't really bring back any proper treasure. But they do in fact add up to finding Davey Jones' heart, which Jack needs because he promised Davey Jones his soul but Jack doesn't want to pay up. Meanwhile, Elizabeth ( who looks absolutely stunning in the film) and Will are supposed to be getting married but they get arrested by this guy because they helped Jack escape. So Will has a deal with this guy and agrees to get Davey Jones' heart for him so he can control the sea and so Will and Elizabeth can be free.<br/><br/>The plot is as i said, very complicated, but very absorbing. The film also delves right into it so that we don't have to sit through 15-20 minutes of explanation about the first film. The character development is brilliant and we some interesting changes in some characters. Johnny Depp is absolutely amazing as Jack, he keeps you on the edge of the seat with the amazing action and makes you laugh until your sides hurt. Kiera Knightley is fantastic as Elizabeth and shows how ruthless she can be. Orlando is brilliant as Will and gives a great performance.<br/><br/>If you liked the first film then you will really really enjoy this one. The 2 and 1/2 hours seems to fly by and the film leaves you on a huge cliffhanger and makes you feel really bad that you are going to have to wait a year to see the next one. This one is probably my second favourite of all the summer blockbusters and is one that you really cannot miss."

"KoFFiE_","5","2","5","27 July 2006"," One word: disappointing
","I expected a lot from this movie, but I had a 'matrix-dejavu' feeling when I left the theater. First was a brilliant movie, but then came the 2nd movie...<br/><br/>Even when not comparing it to the first-one it was disappointing to say the least. Most of the supposed to be funny moments weren't spontaneous at all, in my opinion mostly due to bad scripting/directing. There's not much you can say about Johnny Depp's acting, only that it couldn't save the movie for me.<br/><br/>The movie felt inconsistent, forced, some things compressed into very little time, and some very lengthy things that have absolutely no contribution to the whole movie, except for making it longer. It felt like an episode of a very expensive but bad sitcom where nothing really happened except work towards a cliffhanger. I suppose I know what the highlight/peak of the movie was supposed to be, but it didn't impress me at all, and I wasn't the only-one that felt this way.<br/><br/>One of the things that also irritated me most is that it felt like they had to fit all characters from the 1st movie back into it, which seemed unnatural, some of the characters served little or no purpose in the movie. Also, the characters in general are inconsistent, certainly towards the end it goes completely wrong. There's little interaction between Keira and Orlando, virtually none between Orlando and Johnny, and a little bit between Keira and Johnny, but not much at all. The movie doesn't concentrate on characters at all, which was one of the better things in the 1st movie, which also resulted in most of the funny moments. Now the focus seemed to be on special effects and some far too long script to tell what there is to be told. Making an 'extensive' resume of the story would take fewer lines than I wrote here in this comment.<br/><br/>I wouldn't go see the movie when you haven't seen the first-one. A few of the moments that actually made me smile were references to the first-one, and also the script relies too much on the audience knowing what happened in the first movie and knowing the characters. Offcourse it is a ""Pirates of the Caribbean 2"", so some things could and should refer to the first movie, but this much? No thank you..."
"bulletproofclod","8","2","5","26 July 2006"," Phenomenal
","Perhaps the most anticipated movie of the summer, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does nothing to disappoint the loyal viewers of the first film. Captain Jack returns, perhaps better than ever. The love triangle that was only insinuated in Curse of the Black Pearl is brought back, leaving every Pirates fan with something to look forward to next summer. The chemistry is sizzling, and the dialog is clever and smart enough to keep adults and young children alike entertained.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley can be a low point in this film, I found her facial expressions to be somewhat irritating, but her character is definitely one of great importance. I wait in bated breath for the next installment, and know that I am not the only one."

Captain Jack is his usually rum drinking self staggering around and delivering some of his brilliant one liners. Johnny Depp delivers a brilliant performance once again. That man can do no wrong. Absolute genius. <br/><br/>Orlando has grown as an actor and Keira is great as the leading lady.<br/><br/>The visual effects are great, Davy Jones is amazing to look at and the detail that has been put in to his crewman makes me smile.

","THis movie was great. Although it may be a transition movie to ease into the third, it had great effects and great acting. 10 out of 10, two thumbs up! The movie was hilarious. Johnny Depp superseded himself in this sequel. I found that the role of William Turner (played by Bloom) was not his finest. Kiera Knightly outdid herself in this movie, by far better than her last role in Curse of the Black Pearl. I enjoyed the great action scenes and hilarity, but i was not particularly fond of Davy Jones' accent. I did not imagine him to have an Irish accent but i thought his role was well played. I've had some disputes with my pals about how good this movie was but i found it to be amazing!"
"steeped","10","2","5","25 July 2006"," Nothing too special.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest wasn't exactly what I thought it would be. This movie had great sword fights, wicked entertaining action and it's heart-jumping moments were memorable but the one thing I expected the most to come out of the movie which didn't was the friendship. The bond between Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann wasn't like in the first movie when they where all happy-go-lucky. At first Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) sets up Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) by sending will Turner to his death on search of a key. When Sparrow sees that Will Turner was about to get shot... he just sat back and enjoyed the show! There were also scenes where Will and Jack were sword fighting to kill each other for no apparent reason. Shall I mention through this fight, half the time they were friends and fought the pirates, and other times they looked at each other and took a swing. MAKE UP YOUR MIND! YOUR CONFUSING THE AUDIENCE! And you can't forget about how Jack tried to make out with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). She who apparently was in love with Will kissed Jack (cry. I hate love moment). Fine she tried to kill him after, but why would they kiss? And at the end **PLEASE DON'T READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN MOVIE** Jack ""died"" even though the audience knows he will come back in the third movie. Staying on topic, there WAS no ending to the movie. They didn't get what they were looking for. They didn't kill Davy Jones and nor did Will and Elizabeth get back together. THERE WAS NO ENDING! I would have to give this movie a 6.5/10 (barely thumbs up) because the action was awesome. I am sure they left the movie off at a cliff-hanger because they want you to see the third and final Pirates of the Caribbean feature. I would see this movie in theaters or rent it... but not buy it."

When he (who shall not be named) walked down the stairs me and my friends were like OH MY GOD!!! (lol). That's how movies are supposed to finish, With the movie goer excited and happy... There hasn't been a good movie like this in a while that has left me completely happy about it. And I love how the characters are played by the same actors, you get attached to them and it's not like you have to watch there performance and see how you like them.. you KNOW you like them so it's easier to watch the film. I know I'm probably rambling on and on right now but I just LOVED this movie. It was awesome!"

","POC2 is everything I expected. It has an entertaining storyline, lots of subtle and outrageous humor, daring sword fights, awesome special effects, and fun with Orlando, Johnny and Keira. In short, it's a perfect summer movie.<br/><br/>Although I was attracted to original movie because of Orlando Bloom, I join those who applaud Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack. I was not familiar with his work until POC but am happy to say that he continues to entertain me with his over-the-top performance. The mannerisms and subtle facial expressions he uses are fun to watch. Kudos also go to the writing team (Ted Elliott, Terry Rossio, Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert)for giving him such wonderful dialog. Captain Jack has to be the most literate pirate on the high seas.<br/><br/>Orlando's performance as the straight-laced Will Turner is terrific. He's handsome and heroic ... and, of course, a pirate at heart.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer has created an excellent musical score for the action, the adventure, and the fun. I've already added it to my music library.<br/><br/>I'm definitely looking forward to POC3 in May next year."
"paulandannaeckert","5","2","5","24 July 2006"," Should have been better than the first, but it's not.
","I have to admit, I was not a huge fan of ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"". (6 out of 10). But after seeing the previews for ""Dead Man's Chest"" I was optimistic. Caharacters were already established, seemed like there would be more action, and yes, more humor.<br/><br/>Well, appearances can be deceiving. This film tries, but ultimately winds up being a disappointment. Johnny Depp's Capt. Jack Sparrow was definitely the best thing about the first film, but here comes off as somewhat annoying rather than funny. Much of the film is played for humor, but it does not work very well. I found myself shaking my head at much of the slapstick instead of laughing at it.<br/><br/>The narrative is muddled and confusing, which is compounded by the fact that the film is too long. Too many scenes seem unnecessary and exist just to stretch things out.<br/><br/>However, the film is not a total wash. Things really pick up in the last 45 minutes or so and set up perfectly for the 3rd installment. Actually, based on the ""cliffhanger"" ending, I was thinking that now the story is really ready to take off! Too bad it took nearly 3 hours to get there."
"bcrh","9","2","5","24 July 2006"," Best sequel this year
","Now, I actually saw Dead Man's Chest over a week ago (The 9th, to be exact), and was blown away. I could write this like a nit-picky reviewer, who pays constant attention to every detail, but I'm just your average person, so I'll look at it that way.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has all the basic elements that makes up a good adventure movie: Fun moments, action-filled moments, a few love moments, and just plain jump-out-of-your-seat moments. The gist of the film is as follows: Jack Sparrow is reminded of the fact he owes a debt to Davey Jones (or Davy Jones, I prefer the former), his soul. Meanwhile, Elizabeth Swann and William Turner are set to be married, but their plans are (of course) wrecked, by Lord Cutler Beckett, from the East India Trading Company. The visual effects in this movie are the some of the best I've seen, ever. One example is Davey Jones (played by Bill Nighy), who's appearance is achieved by CGI alone, not with prosthetics as it would (very much) seem. And the soundtrack was done very well (actually, very well is an understatement) by Hans Zimmer, with my favorite bit being Davey Jones' theme.<br/><br/>Overall, Dead Man's Chest is a great film, surpassing the first movie, and is one of the few good sequels. If you haven't already, I suggest you see it."
"ackthpt","6","2","5","24 July 2006"," Rich Special Effects, Sometimes Entertaining, Too Long
","Immediate reaction was I was wasting a beautiful afternoon watching a pirate movie which is only about half as entertaining as (recent DVD release) Yellowbeard.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest is yet another film turning to moments of crushing boredom as it drags through scenes which really answer the question ""at what point does brilliant become passe?"" The first Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Peral was pretty good. This I had high hopes for, but found myself suspecting Dead Man's Chest was going to become a marketing vehicle for a whole new theme park of pirate rides.<br/><br/>This isn't to say there aren't some good bits, I rather think Bill Nighy as Davy Jones delivers a delectable amount of menace, but Bill's an outstanding actor (see him in Love Actually or Girl in the Cafe.) The rest really fit into B movies in terms of credibility. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow, however, is unconvincing as a pirate captain. He strikes me as a twenty-something in charge of a ship of 40 somethings. (Might this be a parallel to the way today's businesses are managed?) Perhaps Tim Curry could have reprised his Long John Silver from the Muppet caper.<br/><br/>All in all, the viewer should know by now that PotC is another in a series of films with the second and third installments largely done at the same time to form a serial. There will be the culmination (one hopes) of this buccaneering (without ever actually looting one Spanish galleon of a single piece of eight) featuring Keith Richards as somebody'd father in 2007. Cheers to the juniour pirates who enjoy this sort of thing. I think I'll pass next summer and see something else."
"TomParis3rdOct","7","2","5","23 July 2006"," Movie's plot was lacking
","I love the original Pirates of the Caribbean, and felt that the movie was well written. The original had just the right amount of love, action, and comedy. The sequel however was lacking, all of these qualities and seemed to leave you hanging. All the trilogies that are great still have an ending, even though you know there is more. This movie's ending and overall flow was distasteful. The special effects were great, the new nemesis was interesting, yet the movie seems to stumble through. I hope the third movie makes up for the short comings of the second. I also hope that Captian Jack Sparrow is more like he was in the original. Despite all that it lacked the movie is still making plenty of money in the box office, which unfortunately tells movie companies all they have to do is throw a bunch of money in advertising and hype and you will make a ton of money."

","Like all films, i was scared of the second being so bad it puts a bad name on all the trilogy. But i was wrong to even consider it! Just like the first, i came away wishing to be a pirate. The adventure and the excitement was all too much for me and i wanted to go watch it again straight after. <br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest is no disappointment. It follows 'Curse of the Black Pearl' excellently (although you do not particularly need to have the first) with the script backtracking on many a time mentioning previous events. Johnny Depp is still as gorgeous and as talented as ever as the world known Captain Jack Sparrow and Orlando Bloom is there again to save the day. We get to see a more in depth side to Will in this film, with more information on his Father 'Bootstrap Bill' and the bond between Will and Elizabeth is as strong as ever. Kiera Knightly is beautiful as the 'not so elegant' Miss Swan this time round and i have to say i was surprised by how well she can pull it off being a rugged pirate. <br/><br/>There have been changes to the ruling of her home town however, with a new man in town taking over. Along with changes to the sea kingdom too. First of all, the special effects in Pirates is simply getting better, and i am sure you will agree as soon as you see it. Davy Jones is a scary part crab, part lobster with tentacles on his head. It was only until i heard afterwards that i knew this was not make up but all simply computer graphics! AMAZING! Anyway, Davy Jones brings his crew of mishaps along for the stormy ride and we find out some more interesting history about Jack. A surprise appearance comes back from an original character not quite as they were. Finally, Mackenzie Crook is back! Yes the stupidest and most unlucky pirate has returned (without the curse i might add) with his one eye and his knowledge of nothing! I love him! The storyline is full of ups and downs but had me laughing all the way through, as well as feeling emotionally involved for certain characters when it gets too much. I'm not gonna spoiler it for anyone but the ending had me on the edge of my seat and wanting more and more! One of the funniest things i saw was the normally quite subdued Elizabeth running around and screaming at the boys over a rather important box. The new and rather spooky Tia Dalma comes in, with some help for our beloved pirates and i have a feeling it is not the last we have seen of her. <br/><br/>What i am trying to say is: the film is brilliant. The acting is amazing as usual and this is only backed up by the breathtaking views, flawless directing and the some of the best effects i have ever seen! Everyone should see this film, its a 10 out of 10 for me. Another Bruckheimer success!"

","From the time the film starts to the time the credits tole, Pirates of the Caribbean dead man's chest takes you on a thrilling journey that never stops. Although originally named after a roller-coaster this film and its dramatic set of twists and turns leaves you hanging for much longer than a few minutes on an amusement ride. In fact this movie is also longer than the original(150 mins), but boy does it pay out in the end! !!!!!!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!! Jack Sparrow in his infinite wisdom is left owing a debt to Davy Jones, the devil of the sea and captain of the Flying Dutchman, in this the 2nd installment of the Pirates franchise. What excels in this picture is the stunning creativity, imagination and performances, again notably by Johnny Depp as Sparrow. The new villain Davy Jones is spectacular and a standout in this film, played by Bill Nighy. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom continue with solid performances throughout with the former taking on a much rougher and more pirate like appearance. Notable moments in the film include the battle for the Pearl against the mighty Kraken, Sparrow's entrance and exit and one of the longest and most enjoyable sword fights you will ever see on the big screen between Jack, Will and a very different Commodore Norrington. Although there has been some criticism of the length of the film and the ending, no one should leave a theater disappointed. When the film finishes it just leaves you more excited about the prospect of a third film coming out next year.<br/><br/>WAIT UNTIL THE END OF THE CREDITS(THERE IS AN EXTA SCENE) ,UNLESS YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE FILM IN WHICH CASE SEE IT AGAIN !!!!!!!!"

","If you've seen part 1, The Curse of The Black Pearl, this is of course a must-see. And an impressive one in my opinion. I find Dead Man's Chest - in terms of humor - better than Part 1. I caught myself laughing out loud at some points, which I hardly do when I'm watching a movie. It's just fun to watch, really! Keira Knightley is again wonderful and a tad bit bold, which I like about her character. Fearless, almost. And I have to agree with some other comments: Hottie Orlando Bloom looks kind of stiff in his role. He totally gets away with it, because he's cute. Johnny Depp continues his class act, as expected.<br/><br/>And then.. Bill Nighy. That guy is great. I've seen him in numerous films and series: he' capable of a lot. He must be proud of his role as Davy Jones. The only part of Bill Nighy's body we get to see without some CG-work on it, are his eyes. I'm impressed by the special effects and choreography in this movie. When I saw the end titles and all the people who have been working on Davy Jones' face alone, i just thought: KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! It looks great. Big compliment to them! You just have got to go see it. Not because of the great story - because it's rather simple - but for what it is: a feast for the eyes!"
"DramaticStarlett9","10","2","5","22 July 2006"," This Movie Was Amazing
","Though some may think this movie was ""utter crap"" in my opinion, it was amazing. I thought it was really, very good. According to some, Bootstrap Bill was a wimp, but I don't see him like that. He was very sweet towards his son which was quite endearing. Davy Jones' crew was not disgusting or silly as some people said. I found them to be very creative and were done with very realistic CGI. It was really neat that, because the Flying Dutchman was able to go underwater, the crew members adapted into sea creatures. <br/><br/>Although the beginning was quite slow, it speeds up pretty quickly and gets interesting almost as soon as Jack escapes from the island with the cannibals. The discussion between the two screwy pirates about the pronunciation of ""Kraken"" is hilarious, as I myself have wondered that very thing many times. <br/><br/>The love triangle with Jack, Elizabeth, and Will is very interesting and I'm dying to find out who ends up with who. There is more rum and more typical Jack Sparrow-ness which is always fun. The actors, as always, do an amazing job, and it's an overall fantastic movie."

","this is movie is a work of fiction , adventure, fear and awesome courage this movie is run by three main character keira knightly Orlando and capt jack the performance of kiera knightley in the movie is at par excellence and more of her role could prove worth watching for the movie. one thing is sure for kiera that she can judge any roles in the movie second best thing in the movie is the surrounding fear of flying dutch captain and it has given much mileage to movie capt jack is worth watching and facial expression of the actor is superb and his little comic roles suits him all thru the movie Orlando just good.one more that is interesting is adventure and adventure with fear in nutshell movie worth watching vinod"
"bartosh5","9","2","5","22 July 2006"," Byzantine--but wonderful!
","Having just seen the movie, I am dying to see it again in under 24 hours. Not only is Johnny Depp the only man alive to perform the role of Jack Sparrow (Captain! Jack Sparrow), he is the only actor able to give the role the shades of complexity it demands. Everything from the first film, with the expected progress of each character, becomes twisted and utterly unexpected. And with more...a lot more. The nature of each character is Byzantine, as are the turns of plot. It's no longer just the ride at the Magic Kingdom coming to life.<br/><br/>The humor is both light and dark--but all of it leaves you laughing and crying aloud. The effects are spectacular, the action a gripping tale every moment. Guaranteed this will make you more excited about installment three than you ever thought possible. As you leave the theater, you immediately discover yourself speculating and debating. For me, I left also with a sense of wonder and a little concern: the wonderful magic of the first movie, the likes of which had never been seen, is still here--but with complex character development and storyline, will that still be true of the third? You find yourself asking, ""what 'is' Jack Sparrow? Fabulous film! Hats off to the cast and crew, and especially to Johnny Depp!"
"Venge","6","2","5","19 July 2006"," Disappointment!!
","This movie will always be memorable to me ... for all the wrong reasons! It is only the second movie I have ever walked out on, the first being ""Total Recall"" with Gov. Arnold, and I only walked out of that one because my wife found it too violent and wanted to leave. It also ranks as the biggest disappointment ever! The only movie that even came close to letting me down this much was ""Problem Child 2"" which took a very cute first movie and turned it into one big poop joke. I didn't have high expectations for Problem Child 2, however, while for Pirates 2 I was eagerly anticipating a great night at the theatre.<br/><br/>This movie starts out badly and just gets progressively worse. It was apparent early on that the movie was in trouble. We had a cliché arrest scene, a less the threatening villain, some bogus deal to get a ""Compass of Your Heart's Desires"" (*cough* just made that name up*cough*)for the villain so he won't kill our two lovebirds .. and on and on and on. Before we are done, we find out Davy Jones is really Mr.Squidhead, who has Mr.Sharkhead and Mr.Coralhead as his crew, that cannibals are intent on eating Jack because they believe he is god and if they eat him they will be releasing his spirit (or some tripe like that ... it didn't make any sense and I don't really thing the producers of this piece of offal really cared), cliché drunken pirates who are always running out of rum (god that joke was overdone!), and finally, in the scene that had my wife and I deciding we'd probably seen enough, Mr. Squidhead playing the organ with his facial tentacles. We walked out, before we burst out laughing at all the wrong places. <br/><br/>Even ... and I say this with great fear and trembling as I have never criticized the man's work before .. even Johnny Depp looked like he was just going through the motions, throwing out the Captain Jack mannerisms in overabundance, and hoping it would suffice as acting. The original Captain Jack was brilliant and unique ... a parody of all the big screen pirates who came before. Well in the sequel, Johnny Depp plays a Captain Black who is a parody of a parody. It was just sad.<br/><br/>After polling my kids who had seen this movie before me, I was truly expecting a comic adventure masterpiece, as one said that it was pretty good and the other said it was great. I thought I raised them better then that!! *hands his head in shame* I am still shocked that the producers of this film would turn a successful first movie into some pirate/star wars/mickey mouse conglomeration.<br/><br/>Those who want to defend this movie can, I suppose, cite its great ""sillyness"" factor. My son's girlfriend said ""Well its a Disney kids movie, what did you expect?"" I guess I was expecting a well made movie, like the original.<br/><br/>However, ""Pirates vs the Squid Man"" was just plain terrible!"
"valkd","4","2","5","19 July 2006"," Not as good as the first one
","I think it's always difficult for a sequel to be as good as the first and Dead Man's Chest had a tough act to follow. The first movie, though long, was fresh and fun. All the acting was good and Depp's character was especially charming. The sequel is even longer than the first movie and shows us nothing different. Depp's character, though still fairly endearing, borders on annoying and the fight scenes are too long. Dead Man's Chest has all the bits and pieces of an fun action/adventure movie, but overall it just feels tired and a little overdone. If the movie had been half as long it would have been twice as good. I have to give praise where praise is due, though - Davy Jones and his crewmates are pretty darn cool. They are the best part of the movie. Hooray for Davy!"
"hansbearnl","9","2","5","19 July 2006"," Finally having fun again going to the movies.
","Yes, I did vote 9 out of 10. And no, I am not some kind of kid voting here on IMDb. I am a serious movie lover, and do agree that Hollywood has lost touch with the audience for a long time BUT... This was real fun! The people all around me where laughing and in the end even applauding. The only disappointment for me was that the film ended where it did and now I need to wait till part 3.<br/><br/>Of course, the swamp-kids and their ridiculous language should have been left out or have had a more adult way of handling language. It was a bit stupid if you ask me. So, no 10 but I give 9 points.<br/><br/>Ever since almost 10 years I haven't had so much fun, I mean, who is laughing for Scream 4? Probably all those US kids, but outside the USA we haven't had REAL FUN with a movie from the USA for ages, and this one makes it all well in the end.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is finally growing up and becoming a real actor, and others do a great job as well.<br/><br/>I would definitely advise people to go watch the movie."
"freckles-14","10","2","5","19 July 2006"," Worth the price of admission
","If you are a Johnny Depp fan as I am, you will not be disappointed, you do get to see quite a lot of him as the ever endearing Captain Jack Sparrow. There is a good deal of exposition going on in the movie, so there are some slow parts, although the movie didn't seem long to me. There was enough action and special effects to keep even the fussiest children in the theater still in their sits and riveted to the screen. I saw it with a friend who is not particularly partial to Mr. Depp, and she enjoyed it as well. Sit and wait patiently through the lengthy end credits for a small ""easter egg surprise"". I definitely think you should see this on a big screen as some of the scenes may indeed lose some impact if you wait to see it on DVD. As Shakespeare would say before every one of his performances began ...To enjoy this performance fully you must permit the suspension of disbelief to take over..in other words..it is a fantasy just go with it and enjoy the ride. It IS quite a thrill ride and I can't wait for the third movie."

"portia1972","8","2","5","19 July 2006"," Funny and fast moving
","This is a good sequel, with a lot of action, but sometimes it is so fast that it is hard to keep track of what is happening. Some characters' makeup is gross, and sometimes there is enough blood or bones in a scene to be gross. There are funny scenes, and a lot of bits that recall the ride or other movies. Jack Sparrow seems less crazy, and even melancholy at times, but with the enemies he has this time, that is understandable. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann are more into being people of action. Other familiar characters re-appear, especially the silly duo of pirates, and a surprise.<br/><br/>This is a very enjoyable movie, but you may have to think for a while, after it, to sort out what happened."
"mery_tess","10","2","5","19 July 2006"," Well done!
","""Dead Man's Chest"" is really better than ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". As to stunts, most of all I like two moments: 1. On the island with natives, when Jack, tied to the bamboo, tries to escape: he runs, jumps, turns over, lands and falls down  it's interesting to know, how this stunt was done; and Jack's crew in the cage tries to escape. It was very funny!!! I had a good laugh over it! 2. When Jack, Will and Norington are fighting on the wheel to have a key. It was really exiting and funny too. In general, my favorite moment is when Elizabeth kisses Jack. Here Jack looks very natural. Keira Knightley plays very well. In ""DMC"" her heroine has definitely grown up and her role is more difficult than in ""CBP"", but Keira Knightley plays excellent! Orlando Bloom (Will) like in ""CBP"" is in ""DMC"" an honest, noble, handsome prince, whose tended hands do not look like a blacksmith's (even a former blacksmith's) ones. Admittedly, I don't like the monsters. They are vile, but not awful, terrible creatures, who devour human's souls. The idea was interesting, but I don't like the result. Jack, thanks to Johnny Depp's brilliant playing, is indisputably charming. He is smart, witty, kind Who can be indifferent to him?! But he is as usual reserved. He is convivial, but through his deep and sad glance we see an interesting and complicated nature, mystery of his soul, which is left unsolved Is he happy? and will he be happy if he got that invaluable freedom he always wanted? and is freedom a thing he did really want?... What about the plot, special effects: I only hope that the 3rd part will be as interesting, funny and exiting as the second one. Thank you. Tess."
"mhmunim-1","10","2","5","19 July 2006"," Oh My Days this film didn't disappoint at all
","So there was me waiting with sheer excitement for this film to come out. And when it did I was there, and what can I say except I LOVED IT. The story was more involved and the beginning was fantastic, I loved how we learn the fate of Bootstrap Turner (don't worry this isn't giving anything away). The special effects are amazing and the ending simply had everyone clapping wildly. This is the kind of film I love, it draws the audience in so much that they can't help but show emotion.<br/><br/>Some people on here didn't seem to like the film, I think one person went on to say it would be lucky if the third part even made it on a straight to DVD release. To that person I say HA HA HA HA, obviously you watched it before it even came out in the cinemas. Come to think of it how did you watch it before it was officially released Hmmmmm?"
"Elvis500002000","9","2","5","18 July 2006"," Equaled to the First Effort
","The sequel to Pirats of The Caribbean: The curse of the Black Pearl had heavy expectations with the success of the first one, but it came through in this sequel with all of the main actors reprising the roles that made the first one such a hit movie. The electricity took off again with Keira Knightly, Johnny Depp, and Orlando Bloom. This Movie has the same type of jokes and feeling as the first one and in many of the same ways it equals the first which many sequels do not do.<br/><br/>The action sequences are very elaborate and well done. With this movie being so good the duo between Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and become one of the duos of this decade and with the addition of a third they should heat up again. This movie is funnier and has great twists that will keep guessing until the end and still leave you wanting more to finish the story. This movie has everything you want in a sequel and you will not be disappointed with this choice in selecting a movie."
"bigdaveadams","10","2","5","18 July 2006"," Counting Down to At World's End
","I never thought i'd rate a film 10/10 for a number of years after watching independeance day in 96, but after watching DMC, it tops Curse of the Black Pearl, and has added great twists. Just like the Matrix, the end of the first film, would allow for a second, but not continue the same story, but DMC does sort of take a break, with part 2 being AWE. Only 11 months to go until it's release! Wish it was sooner though.<br/><br/>Great to see Barbosa back, and helping out the crew. I did expect Jack to come back out of the depths at the end of this film, but that just leaves you wanting to see the next one even more. No wonder that it has fetched $62 million worldwide."
"CelluloidRehab","8","2","5","17 July 2006"," What the ??!?!@!!#@#@# Han Solo encased in carbonite.....
","The second in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie picks up where the first movie leaves off and in much the same way that Empire Strikes Back followed Star Wars and preceded Return of the Jedi.<br/><br/>Newcomer to the series, Lord Cutler Beckett (played by an alumni of the Libertine - Tom Hollander) shows up in Port Royale with warrants of arrest and death sentences for Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly) and the retired and former Commodore Norrington (yet another Libertine alumni - Jack Davenport). Lord Beckett soon divulges the real reason for his visit. It is mostly economic. He is looking to expand the powers of the East Indian Trading Company by procuring Captain Jack Sparrow's (the Libertine himself - Johnny Depp) ""broken"" compass. He offers Will Turner a deal to find Jack and offer him a letter of marque (pardon along with a contract for the company) in return for the compass. Off Will goes in search of Jack, meanwhile Jack is in search of a key that opens a chest (yet we know not of the key nor of the chest) with Keira following closely behind. <br/><br/>This movie will definitely not sit well with those looking for ""meaning"" or profound messages. What this movie does, it does remarkably well. It entertains thoroughly. As compared to the first movie, Dead Man's Chest never takes itself too seriously, while at the same time distancing itself from the original in terms of content and pacing. I found the first movie a little uneven in terms of the pacing of the story and too much time wasted in the other characters. It also was a little bit ""dark"". Dead's Man Chest has more actions sequences, more comedy, and lots and lots of Jack. This movie greatly succeeds because it flows. Action sequences flow into action, which flow into comedy ,which flow back into action, and so on and so forth. This all leads to the end, of which you cannot believe that the ride is over and yet you are eager to get back on the ride. The combination of pirate lore, action and comedy is in perfect balance. <br/><br/>The difference between Empire and Dead Man's Chest is that we know a sequel is coming, while vice versa was not necessarily true. The franchise so far has had some key elements. First and foremost is Johnny Depp. Without his performance and presence, these movies would be lusterless. Jack Sparrow has also evolved from a relatively black & white, two dimensional character into a more fleshed out character in bright, vivid Cinemascope. He is so big, bright and larger than life, that he ""explodes"" onto the screen. <br/><br/>Amongst the other performances, key would be Bill Nighy (Davy Jones) who is proving quite capable to playing the often-in-makeup villain (remember Underworld). Orlando Bloom provides another uni-emotional performance (think of Zoolander's one look), while Keria Knightly provides a freer spirit and the new hot cabin boy look. Her character has also developed sword skills, which makes for a more flavorful dish. Mackenzie Crook (the one-eyed Ragetti) and Lee Arenberg (parley Pintel, whom I memorably remember as the sleazy manager with a q-tip problem in the Tales from the Crypt episode) play the comedy relief to a key.<br/><br/>The special effects are also key. Industrial Light and Magic has done a superb job in Davy Jones (especially), along with the Kraken and Davy's crew. The special effects isn't all there is. The fight choreography is also key in its uniqueness and comedic aspects. The locations are equally entertaining. In some instances it looks like scenery from Lord of the Rings and at others I am expecting a giant gorilla to jump in and stomp on people. The scenes of civilization (town, savage village and swamp town) look very theatrical. They almost look like they could be part of a new amusement ride at Disney Land. The combination of all the elements makes this movie better and more enjoyable than the original. Here's hoping to a successful third movie, without any Ewoks."
"Howlin Wolf","8","2","5","16 July 2006"," Provides all the 'booty' you'd expect; sometimes perhaps more, because it may even be a tad overstuffed...
","... I love all the little character moments, but besides that there's whole heaps of plot to cram in, too. I had a nagging sense of doubt for a good portion of the film because it has much more story than its progenitor, and maybe slightly less exhilarating hijinks that seem to arise just for the fun of it. Although such necessary subplots threaten to stall it in some spots, things are threaded together skilfully enough in the end to make me suitably forgiving...<br/><br/>Depp's accomplished turn is no surprise, given that this was what had me so hyped up to see it, in the first place... I liked the fact that most of the roles of the returned were expanded, which may account for the length, but on the other hand it's at least trying to be an inclusive experience for both the cast and the audience, alike. The decision to promote Keira to 'one of the lads' was on the money, since she's in possession of a distinctly tomboyish natural charm which now no longer need be concealed. I understand why Orlando is most often stuck being the straight man, since he would no doubt look uncomfortable if asked to be anything but the upright exemplar of a human moral compass.<br/><br/>I'm still heartily enthusiastic and on board for the next voyage in under a years time. Mild curiosity - even for casual fans - should be enough to have them exit feeling the same way..."

"DarthVoorhees","9","2","5","15 July 2006"," Decent follow up which out does Curse of the Black Pearl
","I hate to burst the bubble of the fan girls who have posters of Jack Sparrow all over their walls but Black Pearl did not work as a film. It was chalk full of plot holes,the story dragged and Orlando Bloom did not have the skills as an actor to handle a leading role. I walked into Dead Man's Chest expecting a complete rehash of the original but I was pleasantly surprised when I was proved wrong. Unlike Black Pearl Dead Man's Chest actually shows Pirates for what they were,cheaters,murders and disrespectful men. Jack Sparrow the so called hero of Black Pearl is shown here as a selfish coward. The supernatural elements of Dead Man's Chest work much better than the curse in the original. The concept of Davey Jones and the dead man's chest is very clever. Unlike Black Pearl Dead Man's Chest takes the time to explain what our the ghost and goblins are and what makes them tick.<br/><br/>The special effects here are outstanding. ILM has outdone themselves. The set designs are impressive as well, they take us back to the time frame of the story perfectly.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest still has a great deal of plot holes but I have faith that they will be explained in Pirates 3."
"jamiepowell123","10","2","5","15 July 2006"," Johnny Depp and the others pull it off again!!!
","I loved the movie! Johnny Depp was really hot and super funny! I'm really disappointed with all the critics. They all seem to have a short attention span saying it was too long because it was perfect and the humor was constant and really funny. If you liked the first one, trust me you'll like this one. I've seen it twice and seeing it again very soon. Johnny is the hottest! Please go see it, it's the best! Everyone who I know who saw it said it was great from eight to fifty-five. The effects are flawless, and the acting is superb. I can't wait till the DVD comes out, I'm going to faint. All who see their movies because critics say it's good should ""go out on a limb"" to see this one if you are like that. But trust me, you will not be disappointed. But a word of advice is don't get anything to big to drink at the theaters, it is long but in a good way, it does keep you entertained. Just be ready for anything and everything when you go to see this. But if you did like the first one, still keep your mind open and ready to love the second one. It is great, wonderful, funny, and extraordinary."
"dj_bassett","Null","2","5","15 July 2006"," Disappointing
","The effects are good.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp remains amusing.<br/><br/>Keira Knightley is very beautiful up there on the big screen. I don't think she's well-cast in these big budget action spectaculars, though: she has a modest, quiet kind of talent that is just better served by costume dramas and romantic comedies and the like. Too much of the time she just feels drowned out by the action. And also, frankly, no offense to the girl power contingent, but who wants to see her in guy's clothes fighting? I fully agree with Sparrow: she should be in a dress or nothing at all.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is a stick. I keep forgetting he's even in the thing.<br/><br/>The movie more generally suffers from being fundamentally misconceived. Did anyone really care about Bloom's father issues? Or Ms. Knightley, torn between the two men in her life and then burdened with a third potential love interest? No, of course not. We all wanted to see the same damn movie as the first one, but this time with Depp as the star. Well, he's not exactly in a supporting role here -- this is more of an ensemble piece -- but he has to share a little too much screen time with everyone else, because this is a straight up continuation of the story. Like we care. This is especially a problem in the beginning: the set up is long and craftsmanlike, but it's all in the service of a bad idea, and it just weighs things down.<br/><br/>I also thought the movie just didn't know how to end, until finally it just stops -- while we wait for the sequel, in a pretty ham-handed cliffhanger.<br/><br/>I'll probably see the third, but I'm not optimistic."
"rogconklin","9","2","5","15 July 2006"," Ignore the negative reviews
","The negative ""professional"" reviewers didn't like the first POC:TCoTBP, so, of course, they didn't like the second. But also take the positive reviews with a grain of salt (or sand). This movie is a little darker (and really deserves the PG-13 when Jack is given a necklace of human toes and fingers. Which he proceeds to gnaw on.) than the first. That isn't to say there aren't light hearted moments, it is just that when you are dealing with finding the still beating heart of Davey Jones, then the tone is a little dark. The movie starts out with poor Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) sitting in the rain, wondering where her groom is. Unfortunately, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) has been arrested for assisting in the escape of an enemy of the crown, namely one Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). When he is brought to her, she is also arrested for the same crime, with only one co-conspirator missing, Commadore Norrington (Jack Davenport). There is a new master of Port Royal in the person of Lord Cutler Becket (Tom Hollander) who wants Will to find Jack and ""convince"" him to turn over that broken compass. Little does Will know that the compass points the location of Davey Jones' ""Dead Man's Chest"" which contains the aforementioned heart. That, in a nutshell, is the driving force to the movie. Keira Knightley is still channeling Domino Harvey, in that she kicks some serious ass when fighting, either barehanded or with double swords. Johnny tones down the foppish act just slightly, and does a pretty good job seducing Elizabeth. Will is still Will, trustworthy, loyal, helpful, (and the rest of the Boy Scout Law). The rest of the cast is fantastic. Bill Knighy seems to like to play the same character. His voice is about all that you can recognize, but you will hear Viktor (his character in Underworld and Underworld:Evolution) in the way he talks. The two former undead pirates, Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragetti (Mackenzie Crook) are back, and manage to get back on the Black Pearl, but don't give Jack too much trouble. Keeping in mind the PG-13, the whole family will enjoy this film."

Number 3 promises even more suspense and drama. Maybe even a love interest renewed. Go see it for yourself. This is a movie that needs to be seen on the big screen.

It dragged a lot of the time. The story wasn't as strong as that in the first film. Orlando Bloom, didn't hold his own with the other actors. HIgh points for this film, Kiera Knightley did very well and held her own with Depp. The set and scenery were great. It was a pirate movie. Then of course there was Johnny Depp. This movie is worth seeing, it just isn't the first one. However, I usually don't like the second movie in a trilogy setting and I think third installment has already been shot. I am definitely looking forward to that film.

Even more when the first time I went to try and see it, every showing was sold up until 12 am!!!<br/><br/>When I eventually managed to get into a cinema, I was all set to see it. For the first 10 minutes (the arrest to about the bit when Will is captured) I was totally not impressed. This was nothing like the standard the first film had set. But luckily it was just slow! The producers could have speeded this up.<br/><br/>The thing about these films is that they capture all the old sailor stories and myths, such as Davy Jones, The Flying Dutchman and the Kraken and wind them all together. So, The Flying Dutchman is captained by Davy Jones, who just happens to have an evil 'beastie' (Cpt Jack Sparrow's word, not mine!) at his beck and call, the Kraken.<br/><br/>This makes them appeal to almost all men/boys, which male can truthfully say that at some point in his life he has never pretended to be a pirate??? My younger brother (10) was spell-bound through the whole film and I know my dad will want to see it!!! As it has a girl (and a pretty famous one at that) as a main character, I think a lot of my friends (13-14 year old girls) will want to watch it!<br/><br/>Its pretty hard to think that both these films sprung from a ride at Disneyland. <br/><br/>So, totally go see this!!!<br/><br/>Em xXx"

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was entirely original, but embracing of its predecessor. The characters are as good as always. The ending holds a handful of different surprises... All of which are good. Most might complain about the ending, but I found it to be highly cinematic.<br/><br/>Once again, the PG-13 rating is thoroughly taken advantage of and it helps the overall mood of this film. The score is butchered and basically remixed. That's my only complaint.<br/><br/>In this film, Jack Sparrow is much more of a pirate and less of a do-gooder friend, it all works. Will Turner is less of a straight hero and more of a gritty swashbuckler. Keira Knightly is hotter than ever, with her painted on fake cleavage. Bill Nighy (Billy Mack in Love Actually) steals the show as Davy Jones with his incredibly amazing make-up/CGI combo. Also, points fr bringing back every single characer from the first...<br/><br/>The film is worth admission, alone, for the last half hour. It totally hit this film out of the park. I won't give any spoilers, but it's one heck of a ride. Jack Sparrow will never be looked at the same.<br/><br/>The next film takes place in the Caribbean and in Singapore with Chow Yun Fat at an Asian pirate. So... only ONE YEAR left till we see what happens next in... Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End<br/><br/>This film's old fashioned feel and homage to sea tales and legends is wonderful. The cast shines. The story is even more entertaining and mind blowing than the first.<br/><br/>Best film of the year, along with United 93."
"crazys43","10","2","5","14 July 2006"," Depp and Nighy blew me away.
","As biased as my absolute adoration of this movie may be from becoming a giddy schoolgirl each time I hear the name Captain Jack Sparrow, I feel this sequel is well worth every bit of appreciation I give it. I saw it twice already and thought the second time was just as enjoyable as the first. What Johnny Depp has done with his character is simply amazing. I believe the relation a movie going friend of mine, who is a harsh critic and felt significantly less enthused about this movie than myself, compared Depp to Marlon Brando in that Depp is able to do to make a legend out of a single character. Bill Nighy as Davy Jones was another role that will forever remain memorable for me. It was great for laughs, action, endearing characters, some tear jerking moments, and overall great pirate adventure."

","I didn't find the film too long at all and it provided the ultimate cliffhanger at the end. I did expect Barbossa, but earlier in the film. The CGI was brilliant. I found it a lot more adventurous than the first instalment and it looked like the creators had taken a big gamble, but it paid off. Johnny Depp was one of the funniest people I have ever seen in a film and his entrance, like the first film, was fantastically done. Davy Jones looked really weird, but effective. I really can't wait for the third part of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' in January 2007 and I'll no doubt be waiting in anticipation. I hope the DVD has plenty of extra features and deleted scenes, although the film explained things really well."

","Well what can I say, perfection! Just as good as the original If not better that shows what a good movie this was. Depp was yet again magical playing the role of the hilarious captain Jack Sparrow and put It in a brilliant performance as did Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom. The effects were awesome, breath taking at times and the music was right on the spot every time. This movie Is the Empire strikes back of our time leaving the audience on a terrific cliff hanger setting up the third and the end of the trilogy for something truly special.

","I went in to the theater with great expectation for Dead mans Chest and to begin with it was looking good.<br/><br/>I like the darkness of which the film started, it made me think that it was going to give a much more bleaker outlook on piracy and life on the open sea. the cinematography was brilliant, with really gloomy shots in the torrential rain. but then we are waiting perhaps a further 15 minutes before any sign of a story kicks in. and to be honest there is pretty much no link at all to the previous episode ""The Black Pearl"" apart from the characters, the ship and the setting. That wouldn't really matter if this was a great film.... but in all honestly it isn't.<br/><br/>Firstly lets take the best thing from the original - Johnny Depp's performance. in ""The Black Pearl"" it was fantastic, funny and curious. but in ""Dead mans Chest"" the film studio have really milked it too much. Every scene has Jack Sparrow stumbling/mumbling/cracking one liners. (some of which are very good) after maybe 45 minutes we have seen good ol' Jack being chased several times doing his silly lean backwards run...... it gets really repetitive and loses its humor. i felt this about his part for most of the movie.<br/><br/>Other characters just don't develop at all apart from Norrington, Orlando Bloom still can't act and Keira Knightly is a weak leading lady. both of their characters have no new story to tell, apart from Will turners dad turning up..... but we learn nothing new about this side story at all. so what was the purpose of his dad being in this film?<br/><br/>The comic relief characters of pintel and ragetti are brilliant, as they were in the first adventure. There are other things to enjoy here too, The SFX, the set design and score are all excellent.<br/><br/>I think i was expecting a lot more and maybe the 3rd installment will deliver a lot of answers and tie the stories in together better. as a popcorn movie ""Dead Mans Chest"" works OK, but i left the theater with nothing much to think about other than a character from the first film reappearing at the finale, but even this twist felt like it was put in because ""you have to have a twist"".<br/><br/>I am looking forward to the 3rd part, but i feel let down (not matrix reloaded style) enough to not get overly excited by it."
"DarkVulcan29","10","2","5","13 July 2006"," Johnny Depp does it again
","He once again steals the show, and outshines everybody that is in a scene with him, in this movie. He portrayal as the humorous, sword fighting pirate known as captain Jack Sparrow, seems to make this movie always fun to watch. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightingly are fine in their roles as Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, but they keep getting out shined by Johnny Depps captain Jack Sparrow. The Effects are incredibly awesome. The story starts out Will and Elizabeth meet up with Captain Jack Sparrow again, on an adventure when Jack makes a deal with the phantom pirate known as Davey Jones(Bill Nighy from Underworld) to find his chest. Quite a fun movie to watch, like the first one was. I can't wait for part 3."

The special FX were very well-done, and the very intricate plot set the stage for the third one very well. Also in some parts it was very funny, and I loved seeing the return of some of the supporting cast from the first one, like *spoiler* Norrington and two of the other pirates from the Black Pearl. I won't give away the ending, but I will say that after that ending, I can't wait until next summer. Takemy advice and see this movie in theaters, I've seen it twice.

","Like Captain Jack Sparrow swore a blood oath to Davey Jones, I think we avid movie goers should bear allegiance to Gore Verbinski for giving us a summer film we can sit and enjoy! Too long has this summer been with disappointing sequels (xmen 3 namely, and i think any film with the name 'fast and the furious' is already drifting its way off a cliff), pretentious indies (nacho libre), and movies that Jesus himself couldn't get made (""the little man"". >sigh<), that we have a summer blockbuster that truly delivers. OK, 'superman' was entertaining, but dear lord i expected more, especially from brian singer.<br/><br/>Last year 'batman begins' took the cake as my favorite summer blockbuster of the year, and I think these pirates have seized this one.

"classicsoncall","8","2","5","12 July 2006"," ""Set sail in a general that way direction.""
","The first time I EVER heard about Davey Jones' locker I was probably about eight years old and read about it in a 'Mighty Mouse' comic book back in the 1950's - I still remember the panel! The story never really made it clear about the legend, so I sit here almost fifty years later thinking about that story and the film I saw today. Whether the movie version bears any resemblance to the actual legend I still don't know, but it made for a good flick, and a worthy sequel to the original ""Pirates of the Caribbean"".<br/><br/>The pace of the story is pretty quick, and I'll admit that repeat viewings are necessary to catch the nuance between all the characters and events going on in an effort to retrieve the 'Dead Man's Chest'. The nutshell version says that the owner of the chest and the beating heart of Davey Jones inside will rule the high seas. Besides good old Davey himself, there's an entire boatload of characters setting their sights on the mythical treasure.<br/><br/>The first appearance of Johnny Depp as ambiguous swashbuckler (swishbuckler?) Jack Sparrow was quite clever utilizing the painted eyelid gimmick. The cannibal get away scene by shish-kebob Jack gives new meaning to the term fruity pirate. I couldn't help making comparisons to the frenetic pacing of an old time Warner Brothers cartoon with a number of scenes in the picture, and I think that was a positive for the movie. This is the type of picture one views strictly for entertainment value and on that score I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>No need to go into any more detail. With only six days under it's belt at the time of this posting, the movie is setting all kinds of records and has already elicited over eight hundred comments in this forum. The franchise is achieving a popularity awarded to only a few others, and with no pretense other than offering a whole lot of fun. Hoist ye sails matey!"

","There was much to be expected from the sequel to one of my favorite movies. Unfortunately it did not meet any of my expectations and I spent the entire time in the theater asking myself 'Is it over yet?' Boring battle scenes, cheap jokes, cheesy acting, sub-par story, stupid new characters, and a horrible ending. A complete disappointment and embarrassment. I do give a nod, however, to the visual effects which were stunning, but a film with such a big budget tends to drift away from direction and screenplay and focus only on visual effects which in turn does not make a good movie. The effects are what give this movie 2 stars out of 10. POTC: Dead Man's Chest was a waste of money and an embarrassment to Black Pearl AND Disney studios. I only hope the third installment is better."
"atjenkin","3","2","5","10 July 2006"," box office bastard child of a great movie.
","First objective for huge Hollywood action packed movie...score a lead actor worthy of attention by a large audience...second objective is to score a babe. This movie accounted for both objectives in Knightly and Depp. I am a huge fan of Depp so I enjoyed his acting talents on the big screen. Kira Knightly is a fox plain and simple. Orlando Bloom did a fantastic job of holding his own in a heroic role over-shadowed by Depp's character. For these reasons I give the movie a 3....now to why it is only a three. The plot in this movie was driven by force. As a huge fan of the first movie I was disappointed by the recycled characters and plot line. I had very high expectations going into the theater even though I should have known it is virtually impossible to follow up a masterpiece like the first one with a sequel as equally good. Instead of driving home the plot by reiterating exactly what was going on, the movie jumped around and danced through pivotal scenes. I love a good action movie yet this screamed of Hollywood trying to make a buck off ticket sales. I felt that this entire movie was a set up to get people to go see the third one which there undoubtedly will be. on this account they did a good job setting up exactly what will happen in the third movie while leaving supposed fans of the movie with a little bit of controversy. They pieced together a plot that made me feel like I was watching an extended version of the first movie. <br/><br/>And now to criticize myself; the two people I saw the movie with loved it. They thought it was fantastic and I guess it could have been. It is short sighted of me to ask a movie setting up a trilogy to wrap up a plot so thick with meat. It reminded me a lot of The Two Towers and the way you are left at the end of that particular book and movie. The action scenes were set up with wit and humor. Dead Man's Chest has fantastic stunt work and special effects worthy of giving credit to anyone who worked on the movie. The characters created and brought to life were disgusting and realistic. <br/><br/>If it weren't for a forced and recycled plot line and characters I would give the movie a 7."

","It was was so unbelievably fake. You are even able to tell that Keira Knightly had hair extensions... I was very disappointed when i saw it. the first movie was great. The beginning and ending of the movie was awful. the jokes they tried to say weren't the least bit funny. i would see it then leave the movie in its box collecting dust for the rest of eternity. On the other hand however my cousin really enjoyed it a lot. I believe that if the movie wasn't a sequel i would have rated it higher because I wouldn't have compared it with the first movie. They were trying too hard to make it better that the ruined the movie. next time they should make it simpler, and hopefully better."
"james_norman1981","5","2","5","10 July 2006"," Profoundly disappointing
","This sequel to 2003 surprise blockbuster has been marketed as more of the same. Unfortunately this is not the case. Like the original Matrix, Pirates 1 came out of nowhere to knock everyone's socks off, a very original, funny, action packed if slightly overlong film that created several lovable characters, none more so than Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow. In that film he was the centre of just about everything good and the film suffered whenever Sparrow was off screen. Sadly, in their feverish attempt to cash in on Depp's new found mega-star status, the producers have failed to keep in mind what made his character so popular: his charm. In this film the rumbustious, rapscallion nature of Sparrow has been taken away, leaving a rather camp damp squib in its place: a charming, debonair but scheming pirate metamorphosed into an unamusing caricature of himself.<br/><br/>Sparrow just isn't funny in this film. In fact, for some reason, the producers have decided to actually skip past the scenes in which he could've stolen the show (again)! Instead of having Jack talk/lie/cheat/manoeuvre his way around various obstacles, whether it be two slow witted marines, an officious soldier or what have you, here we see Depp mostly AFTER he's been successful. You're not shown how he does it and, because of this, you don't really empathise with the ridiculous situations he gets into. Case in point: when Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) tracks his acquaintance down for various reasons, Depp has managed to talk himself into the position of chief of a tribe of cannibals. But you never see this happening! Instead Depp's humour is limited to running like a homosexual stereotype and occasionally saying 'Bugger!' a line which wasn't really funny the first time and loses all appeal by the fifth repetition. This means that the film is overly reliant on its story to keep you occupied and, here's the kicker, you only get to see half! Yes, again like the Matrix, Pirates 2 and 3 are actually Pirates 2a and 2b, and, after watching for well over 3 hours (150 minutes of film plus adverts and trailers), it comes as a bitter blow to realise that this movie doesn't have a resolution. In fact, rather like the Matrix sequels, the main character is in seemingly inescapable peril... but unlike that film (Reloaded) his mates have all abandoned him! <br/><br/>So how do all the other actors fair? Well, rather like Oceans 12, it looks like they all had a lot more fun making the film than before. Bloom is slightly darker, Knightley is allowed to do more than get rescued and Davenport (the pompous but competent British antagonist of the previous film) is allowed to let his hair hang loose... But, again like Oceans 12, this funness, for the actors, leaves the audience desperately trying to piece together the gaps: how does Elizabeth learn to fight? How does Norrington get in such dire straights? Why does Will fall for EVERYONE'S tricks EVERY SINGLE TIME? At best these things are vaguely alluded to in terms of time passed, hurricanes and other non-specific references, but seldom do you feel that there is a genuine link between Pirates 1 and Pirates 2a.<br/><br/>Finally we come to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones whose chest, of the title, is the object of everyone's desire. But Jones isn't a genuine bad guy! Unlike Geoffrey Rush's Barbossa in the first film, Jones is merely a man looking to retrieve what's his. He's a Scot who captains a submersible ship called the Flying Dutchman and he can summon the Kraken (none of which is explained), but in reality all he ever does is to ask for what's his by agreement. There's not much to dislike. Similarly, like the rest of the film, his back-story is jumbled at best. Why would a Scot name his ship after another, rival country? How did he become the weird looking fellow he is? Why exactly has he placed his heart in a box!?! And so forth... again, other than the occasional, badly scripted explanation, we're not really told anything about Jones and what we do learn is fairly incomprehensible... Naomie Harris herself mentions that there are various stories with some unifying themes but that they all mean the same thing even if they don't and... yes, I got lost pretty quickly too. Oh and what ever happened to Anamaria and the two funny British soldiers? They, like many others, had either disappeared before the start of Pirates 2 or found themselves out and about with nought but a vague reference to miraculous escapes...<br/><br/>Suffice it to say that Pirates 2a comes across like little more than a massive effort to make some cash. The two sequels cost upwards of $200m so it's understandable that Bruckheimer doesn't want people to be able to miss the third if the second one is rubbish, but it still makes a bad film feel even worse. It's not as funny, endearing or clever as the first movie and at 150 minutes (+ sequel/ending) it's a damn sight longer. Overall I'd suggest it's worth a DVD rental at best and even then you're better off waiting until the sequel is available as well as a good six hours to watch them both in. This movie was a great disappointment to me and I can't imagine it will leave any relatively objective viewers particularly impressed. As for the generally good reviews I've read and seem to contradict, I'd like to point out one thing: remember how great we all wanted the Phantom Menace to be? Remember how we all went: 'It's not so bad?' Remember how we felt when we finally gave in and admitted it was rubbish? In time, like with the Matrices 2a and b, I think the Pirates sequels will be similarly reviled."
"mck2990","2","2","5","9 July 2006"," Not very good
","The new POTC movie was confusing, long, and annoying at times. the plot was insanely hard to understand while it was still trying to tie in the plot from the first movie. There were random parts that were not needed in the story at all. the story may have been better in fact with out these lame scenes. Yes, since it is a sequel, everyone will think it's better than it's former, when it's not. The beginning is hard to understand and doesn't make since why Elizabeth goes to jail. in the very beginning is her wedding, but it gets rudely interrupted by the new lord of the island. it was a very bad movie that i had trouble staying awake during, but remember, this is just one man's comments. Just because I didn't like it doesn't mean you won't."
"jegwright","6","2","5","9 July 2006"," Fun but a bit disappointing
","I don't know what it is about the film industry at present but there appears to be a general effort to ""cash in"" on good story ideas by dragging sequels out into two films. We see it often where they produce a good and successful film (the Matrix, Back to the future, etc) and then decide to create a double bill sequel. The trouble is that they don't really have enough story to make a second and third film so they have to pad out the script with dull and irrelevant scenes.<br/><br/>Sadly Pirates 2 falls inside this category. Sections of the film are outstanding with Mr Depp's character of Captain Jack Sparrow probably rating as my favourite comedy character I have seen in an film. It also illustrates what a superb and versatile actor he is. Other sections of the film you just cant wait for them to be over because they just don't add anything to the story and arn't very interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Sadly the film is let down badly by a script that has just been stretched too thinly over the two sequels and the result is a film that starts well but looses its pace and becomes a little dull. My least favourite part of these ""two parter sequels"" is that we have no ending. The film just sort of stops with out any conclusion.<br/><br/>In conclusion I would describe this as half a film who's quality will depend heavily on how the third film concludes the story. It is worth a watch but I would save it for the half price ticket day at the cinema or perhaps even a video rental just before the third comes out. It is just not a patch on the first film."
"Carycomic","10","2","5","8 July 2006"," I'm pretty certain this will be a trilogy to rival ""Back To The Future.""
","It looks like we have another trilogy, folks.<br/><br/>Yes! That's what I said. Because, the final scene of this movie has a cliffhanger ending, similar to ""BTTF 2."" Which, in turn, leads me to hope that ""POTC 3"" was filmed simultaneous with this one! <br/><br/>Regarding ""Dead Man's Chest?"" The first half of this movie reminds me of that cult-classic, ""Nate and Hayes"" w/Tommy Lee Jones. Particularly, the part where Will Turner has to rescue Capt. Jack and his crew from cannibalistic Carib Indians.<br/><br/>From there, things heat up, as everyone tries to get to the eponymous chest, first, once the mystery of its contents is solved! Some of you, however, might be a little disappointed in that revelation, as a similar gimmick was used in ""Brothers Grimm."" <br/><br/>Even so, I loved this movie just as much as the first one. Kiera Knightley's Elizabeth is still beautiful and feisty. A suffragette centuries ahead of her time. Orlando Bloom (as Will Turner) is still honest, gallant, and courageous. And, Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow still has selfish method to his madcap-ness.<br/><br/>As for Bill Nighy, who plays Davy Jones? The Lovecraftian make-up job on him, and the rest of the Flying Dutchmen, can only be described in one word: EWWWWWW! <br/><br/>In short: set sail for the nearest movie theater, me hearties.

","Nearly as funny as the first, but with numerous twists and turns (some foreseen, some unforeseen). Depp again masters the role of CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow! Still straddling the line between good guy and true pirate, Jack switches sides more often than Reba McEntire changes outfits in concert! Orlando Bloom revisits his role as the ever-gallant, quick-thinking, intelligent, (and need I mention --WAY HOT) Will Turner, a young man once again torn between his father's past and his own destiny -- where does piracy begin and can it really be avoided if it is already in your blood? And gorgeous Keira Knightley is back with fiest, finesse, and a fiery kiss (but for whom and to what purpose is it truly given???).<br/><br/>And as if those three characters couldn't deliver enough laughs and side-splitting comedy on their own, Pintel and Ragetti (played by Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook, respectively), are back in their roles as the play-well-with-other-pirates pirates, Ragetti intent on keeping his wooden eye intact and trying to live a ""good"" pirate life now that he is a mere mortal again (""It's the Bible -- it doesn't matter if you can read it or not.

"yo-saff-brig","6","2","5","8 July 2006"," You can touch me chest but not me booty!
","This past week I saw the midnight showing of Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest and found it rather mediocre. This film just didn't deliver as the first did. The comedy was much more sharp and edgy in the first film and it just wasn't as clever as the first. The biggest disappointment though was Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow. He was turned into a bumbling fool where as in the first go around he was a good pirate and captain though a drunk and ever so slightly burnt out. In this he's suddenly gone daft with no explanation, it was irksome. My favorite character from the series has always been Will Turner and he has been given a far meatier role this time on an expedition to save Keira Knightley's Elizabeth from imprisonment. He has to team up with Jack to get the Dead Man's Chest from Davy Jones. I must say that the special effects in this film were nothing short of astonishing! Davy Jones, a big octopussy lookin' thing, looked absolutely real and life-like constantly moving with excellent fluidity, yet you could still tell that it was Bill Nighy. His eyes had such a penetrative presence, he really worked for me, he was vile yet likable. With the poor script that was lacking flare, it was the special effects and fantastic action sequences that saved the film. In my favorite scene, three of the film's heroes are having a tri sword battle in what appears to be a giant hamster wheel rolling across the island's forest landscape. It was scenes like this that allow me to nudge my star ratting to a *** out of four. Where the first half was lacking, including a ridiculous and unnecessary island scene reminiscent of King Kong, the last half more than made up for in terrific imagery and entertaining action sequences. So over all I give it a very mild recommendation."

Despite some quibbles with the sheer length of this second installment, as well as some other quibbles with a few scenes that may have been somewhat gratuitous, the film delivers the same broad, bawdy chemistry as the earlier installment. There are some fantastic sequences, very well choreographed, as well as very good CGI on the various and sundry effects. Loved the bad guys. What's not to love about our returning good guys? Good play with the monkey as well as with the mysterious compass that doesn't point north. Many things explained, as well as many new questions raised. Can't wait until the third one weighs anchor!"

","Just got back from seeing this movie. We bought tickets at 10am for a 9:20pm show and we still had to stand in line for an hour, but it was worth it. So much happened that I wouldn't even know how to summarize it. Let's just say that every character gets 100 times cooler. I would put the Pirates of the Caribbean series above the Matrix and right on par with Star Wars. PoC2:DMC even has a few 6th sense like moments where you don't believe what's happening until the end.<br/><br/>If you liked anything at all about the first PoC, you'll love this one. If you haven't seen the series, you'll love it. It's like the Mask of Zorro on steroids meets Lethal Weapon meets Star Wars topped off with the 6th sense...and I wouldn't be exaggerating."

The fate of the Sea lies in their hands.... I wonder if they can save it? I only hope that that They can reach him.

","I was praying that the curse of sequels would not harm this film. I was very happy to see that this movie was as good if not better than the first film. Capt. Jack and Mr. Turner are as gorgeous as ever and the film is chock fulled with action and humor. The addition of new characters did not harm the film either, it further advanced the background of pirate lore and you got a sense that you were a part of that swash buckling world. I could only hope that the final installment will be just as entrancing. This movie is the best movie of the summer hands down.

"kansaikitsune","10","2","5","7 July 2006"," Reminiscent of ""Empire Strikes Back"".
","Without giving away too much, this film consists of exactly what made The Empire Strikes Back the best of the Star Wars films: the main cast finds themselves split up by a difficult series of events and all embark on their own individual quests before finally reuniting. This allows character development for ALL of the characters before they finally reunite for the stunning conclusion in the last act.<br/><br/>It's a true film triumph. Don't believe the critics that are panning it. It's darkly humorous and filled with very entertaining characters. We are introduced to the darker elements of piracy: betrayal, jealousy, mutiny, and avarice. At the same time, we see heroism, loyalty, courage, and we see that every human comes to a point where they have to make a choice.<br/><br/>The final scene's grand surprise had everyone in my theater cheering and applauding -- chances are you will too! See it, and stay past the credits for one final scene!"

"cavernstones","9","2","5","7 July 2006"," Sequel Equal!!!
","A driving suspenseful direction, and writing of the film keeps it clipping along on pace fast enough to keep you on your toes as our heroes (and anti heroes) careen, crash, fight, and rollick through this second installment of the PoC films. A grand adventure of escapism and it succeeds where so many sequels fail, fantastic digital effects combined with the action and enough inside jokes for the fans of the original to be pleasantly pleased, and new comers both to enjoy this grand feature.<br/><br/>Although Orlando Bloom fans might have wanted some more, the back story is also added to, and Kierra Knightley's Ms. Swann take on a slightly more..uhm, physical role, but Depp goes about his scenes with the distinctive air and flair he first portrayed in the original movie. Which is precisely what he needed to do, rather than overplay his role Depp again shows that grand ability he has often shown, by being bigger than life by showing restraint in capturing the essence of his character once again.<br/><br/>The opening night audience of course, perhaps the hardest of all film goers to please, enjoyed moments throughout the film from beginning to end, and I highly recommend any fans of the original to see this."
"wtfmonbird","10","2","5","7 July 2006"," Best movie this summer!
","If you enjoyed the first movie this one is everything and more. While the film starts off a bit confusing and slow. After a brief 5 min the movie kicks off and the action never ends until the last frame. The humor runs along just as smooth as the action. Not stopping there is the awesome visuals. From spot on CG sequences to amazing shot on locations. In fact, these are the best visuals I have ever seen in a movie. Even better then Lord of the Rings or even Star Wars 3. Lets not forget that the the acting is spot-on. The only thing I can't stand is how the plot seems to have some holes (how the movie opens). Easily this is just overlooked just by the sheer volume of a quality in this film. Overall this is a must see movie for anyone who enjoys seeing movies."
"drug_user39","10","2","5","6 July 2006"," Great movie- character and character dynamics the best...
","You know I was a bit wary about hearing of the sequel of this movie as sequels usually suck. But this one sure as heck didn't! The opening scenes were excellent, really well shot. All the actors and actresses did a splendid job, the plot was well developed. Some very intriguing twists involving the dynamics between Will, Elizabeth and Jack- which I believe, were hinted at in PotC 1. All characters had some useful part to play, each slotting in nicely.<br/><br/>The villains were quite good too. Lord Beckett and Davy Jones as the new bad guys in their different styles of 'badness'. I can also agree with an earlier reviewer that PotC 2 IS comparable to 'The Empire Strikes Back'. In fact there are quite a few similarities between PoTc 1 and 'A New Hope' and PotC 2 and 'The Empire Strikes Back'. Perhaps this can give one hints to how PotC 3 may play out."
"dashfashion","9","2","5","6 July 2006"," Is it better than the first?
","Yep.<br/><br/>I think the critics have done an ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"" on this one. They say it's ""overstuffed"", ""overlong"", ""over-the-top"", over this, over that. I've seen a sequel to surprisingly old-fashioned modern film. It was called ""The Mummy Returns"". From what I understand, ""The Legend of Zorro"" is in the same league. What elements from the originals were daring and adventurous were tamed and rushed in the sequels. Not so here. ""Dead Man's Chest"" is a FAR superior film to ""Curse of the Black Pearl"", a film that leaves you breathless and giddy with excitement after seeing it, not with a headache.<br/><br/>I think one of the things they got right was to take a leaf out of what Johnny Depp did with the original film. He took a role in a genre that had ""black marks"" written all over it, a somewhat bland adventure film that he tizzied and teased to the point where he became the focal point of the movie. Add to that the idea of ""cursed pirates"" and you had a movie. ""Dead Man's Chest"" takes these elements which worked and runs with them. This film is to pirate movies and seafaring mythology what ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was to Saturday MatinÃ©e Serials. And what ""Kill Bill"" was to 1970s Blaxploitation, Martial Arts films and Spaghetti Westerns (Fascinating concoction, that one). It is sneaky and subversive, as Pirates need to be, and the heroes are the least interesting element in it. And it is rip-roaring, hilarious entertainment from the first frame to the last, the most glorious pure entertainment since the Indiana Jones movies.<br/><br/>And y'know what? I knew it would be that. I just knew it. Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow is the most devilish rogue in the movies in quite some time, a character that was born for the movies, like Indiana Jones, like James Bond, like Mad Max. It's so relieving to have something with such old-fashioned sensibilities as opposed to the quasi-religious tone of a great deal of recent blockbusters (mostly comic book films). What Johnny Depp brought to the original was the sense of ridiculous that he knew the movie had in it. And now everyone else knows that too. What a surprise (SPOILER) to find Commodore Norrington returns in such an unexpected manner! What a trip to have Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann engaging in such playful banter with Sparrow! What a gruesome spactacle of Monty Python irreverence is the confection of new creatures, pirates, ships and situations to be found here!<br/><br/>Critics have been spoiled with their blockbusters lately. They've had the gall to be based on great pieces of literature or on deeply mythologised comic book heroes. Great directors like Sam Raimi and Bryan Singer have leant their art-house sensibilities to them and given them more passion and story. This is not a story: This is a thrill-ride. It knows it's a thrill-ride. We know it's a thrill ride. And it succeeds in thrilling us without insulting our intelligence. What did they want? Something deeply felt and serious like a lot of the ""major"" blockbusters? Or perhaps something that was REALLY dumb like ""Fantastic Four"" or any of those idiotic rev-head movies. This is old-fashioned, red-blooded entertainment. I think they've forgotten how to deal with movies like this. This is the kind of movie Robert Zemeckis would have directed in the 1980's, and what's wrong with that? What an absolute pure delight! Every blockbuster should be like this one! I'm going to go out on a limb and say this is probably one of the best movies of the year."
"pacha_chubby","10","2","5","6 July 2006"," A must see movie
","To say the least this movie was excellent. Excellent visuals, excellent soundtrack, excellent acting. What placed it a step above the first movie was the innate feeling of a greater evil that ran throughout the movie. Where in the first one, the enemy was only a mutinous first mate, the enemy here is Davy Jones himself-the Devil of the sea. It steps the movie up to a whole new level. Now everyone is in danger. Jack Sparrow, the one we have all come to love is stretched to his wits end to get himself out of an even stickier situation. The whole scale has been spun 10 times bigger, with greater danger, greater action and an all over greater viewing experience. Also the hint of a romance between Jack and Elizabeth adds a new dimension with a greater weight being placed on the already existing Elizabeth/Will relationship. Not only this but a heated lip-lock between Jack and Lizzie, something I did *not see coming*, but something everybody has been wanting to see since the first one cranked up the movie making it even *better*. But with all this danger and deception, there are still the hilarious jokes, some of which were (thankfully) carried through from the first movie-namely the Rum gag, the same swashbuckling action sequences, now more elaborate than ever, and exotic characters that give the movie its characteristic flair. It has everything. Stunning graphics, tropical beaches, pirate ships, another bewitched undead crew, mysterious voodoo sorceresses, kinky love triangles, rum, an undead monkey, Johnny Depp, cannibals, gambling, laughs, tears, a *cliffhanger* of an ending that almost made me scream but has definitely convinced me to see the third one, everything. Take everything you loved about the first movie, times it by 1000 and you have Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. This is a must see movie!!!"

"davidhutch007","8","2","5","6 July 2006"," Good Open ended sequel!
","After watching the first film it was obvious to all that there just had to be a sequel following Captain Jack's adventures on the ocean and everybody expecting as good a ride as the first film. The film did deliver! Dead Mans Chest finds Captain Jack searching for Davey Jones chest which holds a mythical contents inside, but on Jacks trail is Will who must bring Jack back to port Royale so he and Elizabeth can avoid been hung by Lord Cuttler for helping Jack escape capture, but Will ends up helping Jack to find the chest but also finds a family member along the way! And with Davey Jones making sure Jack and Will have a hard time finding the chest, they certainly have their work cut out for them! Of course with the original film the star of the show is Johnny Depp who is cool, funny, and just great eye candy for the viewer and he didn't win the Oscar last time for his performance but he should win it this time because his performance is even better! And of course we can not forget Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly put in good performances as well but they are overshadowed somewhat by Captain Jack! While the film plays out we meet a few new characters, one of which is the villain of the piece, Davey Jones who is half man, half every underwater creature you could imagine who is played by Bill Nighy. The great thing about the character is you really cant tell when it is Bill Nighy in makeup or when it is full CGI which is a massive achievement. We also catch up with Norrington who is no longer Comadore and is now a drunk who ends up joining Jacks motley crew to find the chest.<br/><br/>Like its predecessor this film relies heavily on CGI, and with some films it just isn't convincing enough but this film is absolutely fantastic with the CGI and with the character of Davey Jones you really cant tell at points whether it is the actor in makeup or not, it really is that good! The action has really been bumped up with even more sword fights in the most unusual surroundings for example fighting in a large water wheel rolling down a hill and also fighting on the ruins of a church. The fights are good but it feels like they are carbon copies of fights we saw in the original and i really wanted something new.<br/><br/>One of the best scenes has to be when the Kraken is summoned. By the way a Kraken is a giant sized octopus type of thing which is a weapon that Davey Jones uses a couple of times during the film and it really does gives some great action scenes.<br/><br/>The direction is very strong as is the script and the characters and i hope that this will continue to the next film. The ending of this film will surprise you as you will meet a character you may not be expecting to wet our appetites for Pirates Of The Caribbean 3.<br/><br/>Overall this films is about on the same level as the first but with some weak places within the film with the pacing being a little off but apart from that all thats left to say is bring on number 3! ******** out **********"

Some classic Sparrow moments there too! Some may think, uh-oh, this might be Overkill, a spin off to get some cash. It's really Really not. This film has the depth of the first, a great plot that makes you think the first film is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle. The film ties in brilliantly with ""Curse"" and sets the scene (breathtakingly) for the third and final film ""World's End"" as I imagine it to be called.<br/><br/>Top notch 8.5/10 The only problem was - it hurt my bladder!

","A little drawn out.<br/><br/>I thought the first half of the film was very good, second a little long winded, which is a shame.

Unlike the first film more time is spent on the other characters like Orlando Bloom, which is a shame as his acting isn't as sharp as Mr. Depp's.<br/><br/>One other thing was the special effects in the first film were fantastic, the second were also as good right up to the Cracken, the CGI stood out very badly from the live action film.<br/><br/>The above are minor complaints on an excellent film that's why I rate it 8 out of 10, but lets hope the third installment picks up the pace a little more."
"Polaris_DiB","5","3","10","11 July 2006"," How to make a successful sequel
","Trying to make a successful sequel is an interesting thing. There's a lot of expectation, but where the expectation comes from is contradictory--on one hand, everyone expects the same characters and the same general quality as the first movie; on the other hand, they don't want the same movie with repetitive, tired jokes. In a movie like Pirates of the Caribbean, which is very popular mostly by force of its interesting and dynamic characters, that line is a bit harder to hit because everyone is attached to the characters, but don't want them to ever really be damaged.<br/><br/>I would say then that this is a very successful sequel. It doesn't necessarily rely upon the first movie, but a lot of what is going on is very aware of the first movie's influence on these characters. It brings back almost all of the characters, major and minor, from the previous movie, but it does accept the task of taking the time to develop them. In a sense, a lot of what happens in this film could be considered unnecessary pandering towards icon recognition. In the opposite sense, this movie seems willing to take risks with character development that might not be agreeable. I personally consider the two to even themselves out and create a sufficiently self-contained movie experience.<br/><br/>A major issue with the film is its ultimate tie-in with the next sequel. This movie, like The Matrix Reloaded, is a bridge between two different movies that deal with different issues. It would probably behoove any potential viewers of this movie to understand that while it has a sort of climax, it doesn't really have a complete story-arch. Don't go expecting to have the complete story else you will be very disappointed. Go to see where the next movie will take you and figure out where the character development is going.<br/><br/>Many have said that this film is ""dark"". I don't really consider a lot of the imagery darker than the original... this one does seem to like its Eldritch horror, but what really makes this movie less light and enjoyable than the first is that for the first time, we see the characters (and especially Jack Sparrow) at their very weakest. Throughout the first movie there's a sense even when things seem to be in conflict that the character's overall capability will eventually work itself out. In this movie, the characters themselves are completely unsure of themselves (the compass, anyone?). This development is actually why I really like this movie by itself: we know Jack the graceful but klutzy looking sort-of-drunk, but now we get to see Jack the nothing seems to be working out serious captain. We also know Elizabeth and Will the lovers, but now we get them not quite knowing what they're doing for each other as well. Because it's such a big change from what they were in the first movie, it does seem almost necessary to have them resolve it over two more movies.<br/><br/>The idea of forcing it into two movies is kind of depressing to me; technically, there is no rule that says a movie must be between one and a half and two hours long. A movie could be a stunning narrative and still be five hours long. However, Hollywood does know audience impatience, and as many people have said about this movie: ""It starts to get a bit long..."" Nobody seems willing to sit down to watch a complete four-hour narrative, so instead they are more willing to pay the price of two tickets. If that's the way their time is valued, that's the way their time is valued, and I don't think I can really do much about that.<br/><br/>So for what it is, this is a very good movie. The strong parts are the ideas behind the character development (though I still don't think Knightley nor Bloom really have that much ability to carry the weight of serious acting on their shoulders) and the very inventive action. The swashbuckling is presented to quite an extreme degree here, and a lot of it is actually quite surprising in where it goes.<br/><br/>Go out and enjoy it. Most everyone else is.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

"Quinoa1984","6","3","10","8 July 2006"," about as twisty and preposterous (and illogically fun) as a summer blockbuster gets
","I didn't expect the moon to be delivered by the sequel to the Pirates of the Caribbean because, frankly, the first film wasn't an awe-inspiring great blockbuster to begin with. It's a franchise based on a ride at a theme park, so you do know what you'll be getting when you enter into the film, which is a story that is less palatable as the action set pieces and sequences. In fact, I'd say I found this sequel to be on par with the first, with maybe a couple of very nice touches with two of the sequences. And, of course, there's Johnny Depp who is like both the magician and the rabbit that's getting pulled out of the hat- you don't know what's up his sleeve, but his mannerisms and facial expressions are also so obvious and over-the-top. He's created one of the more endearingly nutty and more often than not laugh-out-loud funny characters in a Hollywood blockbuster with this and the previous film, and if for nothing else he's worth seeing.<br/><br/>But getting back to the pros and cons of the film. To those who've written (and I've read a few comments) saying this is the next Empire Strikes Back have, forgive me for saying, a screw-loose. Dead Man's Chest happens to not be too unique in one aspect- it pumps up so much contrivance in the plot turns that one is asked not to take it too seriously, but to keep it all in mind at the same time. And it's also, like with the previous Pirates entry, overlong as well in trying to fit in every note, this time mostly for the sake of part 3 coming up (with a 'wtf' twist at the very end). But, of course, most will not go expecting that logical or coherent a story, the bang-for-your buck sequences are where it's at, not to mention visual effects, and the filmmakers don't lack too much of that. The two favorites for me is the sort of wild goose chase over the island where Sparrow and Bloom and the others run from a group of crazed natives, and the big climax involving Davy Jones's huge monster against the black pearl.<br/><br/>These scenes, with a few minor specks here and there, do make the film entertaining enough for a good 'popcorn' movie sit through once over. And there are even a couple of very funny lines or physical gags that might be worth mentioning to friends once the lights go up (and Davy Jones and his crew are a nice step-up from the skeletons in the last film). It's shame then that the same good in what can come with shallow, big-budget flicks like these don't carry the same creds with a good enough story. 6.5/10"
"Michael Laing","5","2","6","7 August 2006"," Over blown and sinking
","The original Pirates was an unexpected pearl, it got everything right, the characters, running time, action and story. The sequel is a mess. The story has gaping holes, the script is to put it politely flabby, the dialogue uninteresting and the action dreary. Having more on screen does not make it better and thats what Disney have done, made a bigger more sluggish version of the original film. Johny Depp is OK but his Captain Jack isn't nearly as much fun now he is in command and the rest of the cast are a bit wasted. The film reminds me of the of the two matrix movies mainly because they brought down the original film and I get the feeling that this and the next film will do the same for Pirates."

So I had no idea that I was only going to get half a story (or less, depending on how many movies the producers decide to take to tell it).<br/><br/>The first 90 minutes, even 2 hours, was entertaining. Jack's character was a little worn I think - his magical quirkiness from the first movie was kind of tired here, nothing new. But overall the story was good. I'd give the movie a 7 out of 10 rating (3 1/2 stars out of 5) if it had held up to the end. (Although, I have no idea what possessed the writers to turn Davy Jones into an octopus-head.)<br/><br/>Now, the first movie clocked in at 143 minutes according to IMDb, and I saw that movie twice. I was entertained both times until the end, bottom unscathed. After all it's a frigging pirate movie - you'd think 90 minutes would be enough. However that thought never crossed my mind.<br/><br/>In Dead Man's Chest, that thought crossed my mind repeatedly. ""It's a frigging pirate movie, how long do they need?"" IMDb tells us the sequel is 150 minutes, and yes my bottom definitely started to feel it. For at least the last 30 minutes I was getting a sore butt and wanting the flick to end. But the stories just kept going on. Jack is apparently eaten by the Kraken because of Elizabeth's treachery, Davy Jones' heart is taken but the bad guys still have a hold of it, Will hasn't yet fulfilled his promise to his barnacle-encrusted dad, and then... they're all sitting in an island witch's hut to mourn Jack (including Elizabeth, feeling remorseful it seems), when the witch introduces the ex-cursed pirate captain from the first movie who is going to, apparently, help them find Jack in this world or the black magic twilight world or something. And then the movie ends, just like that.<br/><br/>I was mightily annoyed. In 2 1/2 hours they couldn't even wrap up one of their story lines?? I don't mind leaving a few openings for another sequel to draw on, but this movie had absolutely nothing self-contained about its story. It screamed, ""FRANCHISE!"" It's like a boatman who promises to take you across the river for $12, but then half way across stops and demands another $12 to get to the other side (or to go back). It's extortion. The film turns into something absolutely lame. A skilled film storyteller can tell a good, complete story in 2 1/2 hours (an abundance of time in the film world), yet still leave some of the story open to continue on. But this movie ended as nothing more than a low grab at our wallets. (No these statements do not apply to Lord of the Rings, because everyone knew it was going to be 3 movies that essentially followed the 3 books.)<br/><br/>What's to say that in Pirates 3, they don't play the extortion game yet again? I don't trust them not to. If any of you watch anime, after Dead Man's Chest was over I felt like someone was trying to recreate a similar idea as One Piece, a Japanese anime about pirates which is now on well over 200 episodes. Each episode is about 23 minutes long (a TV half hour), and a given story arc may take many episodes to complete. But, I can download fan-subbed episodes of One Piece for free (donations accepted), legally, from the net, and I know what I'm getting every episode - a piece of a story that may take many episodes to complete, with a new episode coming every week or two. And so that's what I'm going to do with Pirates 3. If, when it finally comes out, it gets some decent reviews, and I find that I still at least partially give a damn, I will wait until it hits DVD then download a free, illegal copy from the net. Coz there ain't a snowball's chance in hell I'm gonna shell out another $12 just to see the end of the current overlong story."

Once again Johnny Depp is amazing as Captin jack sparrow and gives comedy to the film, Keira Knightley is gives a good performance too and brings beauty. Orlando Bloom plays a confident role. Gore Verbinski and jerry Bruckheimer really do well and have Produced and Directed this film with pure goodness.<br/><br/>The film creates a brilliant atmosphere in the cinema and I recommend Dead Man's Chest to anyone.

","I personally loved this film. OK so it's not exactly edited well, OK so it is a bit long but at the end of a day it does what's necessary in a film - it provides you with a means of escapism. That's exactly what a good film is meant to do - lets you watch it whilst dreaming of becoming a pirate, sword-fighting, swash-buckling and escaping from a really big squid (Naturally accompanied by Mr Depp of course!!) and generally helps you escape from your (and my) boring everyday lives into a life of high adventure on the seas! The special effects were amazing, Davy Jone's barnacle-infested crew especially so and i loved the sword fight on the wheel. I don't understand why people are slating this film - it does it's job and it does it well! Hurrah!! Finally a film to enjoy! Girls, just wait for the line ""Hello Beastie!""

This movie features all the great actors as the first movie who are just as good if not better in this movie! Johnny Depp is flawless as always and I even enjoyed Kira's performance (I've never been a big fan of hers). The special effects in this movie are like no other! Davy Jones and his crew are a gross work of digital art. They are so intricate and lifelike that you actually believe that they are real. The only downfall of this movie was Orlando Bloom as once again he overacts almost the entire movie. He is the only thing that takes away from this fantastic movie. The plot and dialog all adds to its greatness! I strongly recommend this movie to all who want an entertaining night at the movies.

I will say that there is a lot of wondering when the movie is over, but the 3rd one will be out in less than a year and will tie up those loose ends. It seems that all of the ""professional"" ratings that I read about are completely opposite of what I, and many other people that see films, actually think. The special effects, story line, and entire film was incredible. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I have to say, that if someone that watched this film gave it a really low rating, chances are, they didn't like the first one either, so really, they shouldn't have judged it at all."

","My cinema-going has always proved that the first in a series (or trilogy) is best, but this latest (Dead Man's Chest) film has broken my record. It is action-packed with solid dialogue and impeccable characters. The plot is simple, yet the actors, writers. producer etc have taken the story beyond words. There is plenty to keep you from dozing off, although Miss. Knightly sheds little clothing. <br/><br/>It is quite obvious that Depp has spent considerable time (and propping up the bar) with Keith Richards, and adds, no enhances, Depp's laid back persona. The effects, costumes, CGI and the other stuff is well constructed, and emanates in every sequence.<br/><br/>Unlike 99% of those in the auditorium, I stayed through the credits (I do anyway) and found that a new king had been appointed. A great touch for those who wondered what became of the dog, and whether he/she was lunch for the natives.<br/><br/>A well deserved 9/10, a classic in the making, a film that can been viewed over and over again, and each time notice something new."

","Having now seen the sequel to my much beloved Curse of the Black Pearl I have to admit that I was quite disappointed with it. Johnny Depp of course was fantastic and as always can do no wrong in my eyes. Keira Knightley was good but my friend and I agree that we spent more time looking at the contrast of her hair and eyebrow color than at her acting, that said the lucky thing got to kiss the gorgeous Johnny! Orlando was quite improved since the last one as well I thought. That all said the plot was seriously lacking. The director and producers were more concerned with the getting bums on seats for the third one than actually creating a stand alone film. If I was someone who hadn't seen the first one and walked straight into the sequel I would emerge wondering what all the fuss was about!!! Hopefully the third will resurrect the franchise in my eyes!!! But for the mean time I'm going to go watch the original..."

","Following sometime after the events of the first movie we learn about a motive that Jack Sparrow has had all along - to obtain ""The Dead Man's Chest.""

But Jack isn't the only one after The Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Following in suit with the original this is another highly entertaining summer movie, albeit with flaws. Though it does contain that same tongue-in-cheek tone throughout with Johnny Depp reprising what may become his most famous movie character.<br/><br/>However, the mega-budget, expansive sets, multi-million dollar effects, rousing action and feel-good adventure spirit far surpass desired character development. Traditional and expansive adventure yarns like 'The Illiad' or 'Aeneid' and even films like 'Indiana Jones' had a good plot woven into them - it accompanied the escapist action and and spectacular feel. Here there is a plot, simple and quite predictable, but it's there all right. However, the effects are so expansive that the balance is teetering on total overkill. So much time and imagination must have gone into those effects and they are quite spectacular, but with the bare-bones plot they are really the driving force of the movie. Lucky for the viewer that at least the characters are likable so you can manage to forgive the lack of plot and enjoy the film, but it is definitely not as memorable or thoroughly enjoyable as the first entry. --- 7/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action"

Seeing it again, you begin to notice the subtle hints to Davy Jones' crew and search for Jack.<br/><br/>The writers know how to play with your emotions the entire two and a half hours. There was a lot of laughter and some tears around me. The tension keeps building (unfortunately sometimes to the point where the scene becomes predictable) until you think you're going to burst with anticipation of what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie was very well done.

","Dead Man's Chest is as good as The Curse of The Black Pearl or at some point maybe even a little better. Definitely NOT a disappointing sequel as it sometimes might happen. It's extremely refreshing to meet the old characters again and see the new ones as well. Davy Jones & co looks really creepy and unpleasant. The filmmakers have scored right on making the bad ones really frightening. Johnny Depp gives once more an incredible performance as Captain Jack Sparrow. Have you ever seen a bad movie when Johnny Depp is around? All the jokes are once more extremely funny. Keira Knightley is once and again lovely as always. And she also gets some action! What I personally really liked is that this time they gave Jack Davenport a bigger role than on the first movie. Yes, Norrington is back, but this time he's character is so much more than on the first movie. I totally loved his character now. And Orlando Bloom, who honestly isn't the best actor around, this time seems to have developed a bit. He's started to give more nuance to his performances. I already noticed it in Elizabethtown. That deserves a bit of credit also. If you loved the first movie, then you don't want to miss that one! And you might also want to see something that's after the end credits. I can't wait to see the third one, because it's going to be a great final! Excellent movie in a great visual package! 10/10"

"JoshtheGiant","6","2","6","14 July 2006"," Much Better Than I Expected
","Well I'll start by saying that I really liked it, not quite the first one but still the best film I've seen so far this year. The special effects are brilliant, as is the entire technical aspect of the film. Many people people are complaining that it doesn't have enough plot, I plea the opposite, in fact it has too much plot and is occasionally confusing. And now to the performances. Johnny Depp is in my opinion several steps behind his performance in the original(Which I consider to be one of the best ever) He is still quite good though. Keira Knightley has proved that she is a very good actress with two Oscar worthy performances in Bend it Like Beckham and Pride and Prejudice. Here she seems lost, and gives one of the films worst performances. Orlando Bloom surprised me with his best performance since his underrated turn in Black Hawk Down(Something he has failed to get even close to living up to) He actually gives a performance that could be considered decent. Bill Nighy should get Oscar consideration(If eligible) for his brilliant portrayal of Davy Jones. He is rather perfect. Tom Hollinder is extremely disappointing in the other villain roll, he was so good in both Pride and Prejudice and Gosford Park, and here is simply embarrassing. In all a extremely good adventure film."

"VanderDrake","10","2","6","14 July 2006"," The return of the great adventure... again. It's brilliant!
","It took two or three viewings for me to really appreciate the first Pirates of the Caribbean film, but ever since it has held a secure position in my top ten. I was therefore, uncertain to say the least as to whether or not Dead Man's Chest could maintain this high standard. After all, many sequels generally turn out to be huge failures and only monumental successes like 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Two Towers' prove otherwise. Why? Because they are darker; and DMC has this in abundance.<br/><br/>For starters, the lighting in a lot of the scenes is dark, surrounding the mood and journey of the protagonist: Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). Whether he is being arrested by the East India Trading Company, caged by Cannibals, or captured by the legendary Davy Jones. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) may be by far the most watchable character, pulling off one of the most memorable cinematic performances of all time, but he is in reality Han Solo or Aragorn to Will Turner's Luke Skywalker or Frodo Baggins. This trilogy of films is the Heroes Journey, complete with the beautiful Princess Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), this time becoming more of a pirate herself, a monster in the form of the fearsome Kraken, and a witch/wizard via Naiome Harris' Tia Dalma. It is, simply, the perfect adventure story.<br/><br/>The villains are also fantastic. Bill Nighy in particular is able to convey real emotion through the CGI make-up of the squid faced Davy Jones, making him sad as well as terrifying. His crew aboard the sinister 'Flying Dutchman' is one of the most original inventions ever. Whereas in 'Curse of the Black Pearl' we simply had zombie skeletons, this time we have an array of Sea-Phantoms, men who are becoming the sea: a hammerhead man, a hermit crab man, a starfish man etc. Wonderful.<br/><br/>The action is also spectacular and the special effects inch perfect. Jack Sparrow's escape from the Cannibal Island is probably the most fun you will have in the cinema all year. The Kraken is an awesome creation, evoking real fear through the legend before making an appearance. The three way sword fight between Sparrow, Will and Jack Davenport's steely Norrington is a sight to behold, especially when it leads them aboard a runaway water wheel.<br/><br/>I might also mention the appearance of Stellan Skarsgaard as Bootstrap Bill, Will Turner's father. He brings real seriousness and pain to the film, as a twice cursed man trying to keep his son alive. I looking forward to seeing how he is resolved.<br/><br/>All in all, a spectacularly brilliant film full of perfect performances, great cinematic conventions and breakneck action. Brilliant!"

Johnny Depp became one of the greatest pirate characters ever, and lightened up on the swaying. And of course, Orlando Bloom looks great wet (yes, he acted and fenced brilliantly too).<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer must get an Oscar for his truly epic score - it got better than the first, if possible. <br/><br/>The special effects guys also deserve tons of credit for their spectacular work on all the creatures and and battles. <br/><br/>'Pirates 2' deserves all the money it's making, and if 'Pirates 3' takes more than a year, I for one will be protesting."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","2","6","14 July 2006"," Not as entertaining or fun as the first but more than enough other things present to compensate for this.
","""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was an unexpected huge hit and success. It of course would be impossible for a sequel to top this success, mainly because of the reason that every originality and surprise is gone. This is also definitely the case with ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"". We already know the characters, we already know the style of humor in and we already know that it has supernatural elements in it. It makes ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" a less refreshing and surprising movie but luckily the movie is well made and has more than enough stuff in it to still make this movie a thrilling and entertaining one to watch.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is not a better movie than ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" for several reasons. As mentioned before, the freshness of the movie is gone with as a main result that the characters don't impress or entertaining as much as in the first movie was the case. Not even Jack Sparrow does. Another thing is that they wanted too much, as often in sequels is the case. The story is unnecessary complex, with unnecessary many characters in it. It also causes the movie to be unnecessary long (2 and a half hours!). But no of course the movie is no bore. It's a real roller-coaster ride of a movie, even though it takes some time at the start to find the right pace. The new main villain gets perhaps introduced a bit too late in the movie (about half way through I think) but once he gets introduced the action and fun really starts. The movie has countless spectacular and well executed moments in it, especially with the immensely large octopus named Kraken. Especially the last couple of minutes 'are heavy' with good and fast non-stop action.<br/><br/>This time the main villain of the movie is Davy Jones (half man, half octopus) and his 'The Flying Dutchman' crew. So rather than having an army of undead pirates, we now have an army of undead fish. Sounds less scary but the way the fishy crew looks is highly convincing and intense. Unfortunately Davy Jones (played by the always great Bill Nighy) is no captain Barbossa and I really missed him as the villain in this one.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters are mainly the same. Jack Sparrow is still as crazy as he is entertaining, thanks to Johnny Depp of course. It was also great to see how Keira Knightley's acting had matured. It was obvious that she is a more experienced actress now, when compared to the first movie. Her acting is more adult-like and she impressed and surprised me more as in the first movie. Orlando Bloom gets less interesting to do in this movie but he still is good and convincing enough as the heroic Will Turner, although he still is a bit boring as always. He just isn't as charismatic as Errol Flynn or Douglas Fairbanks who did similar movies as he did but only about a century ago.<br/><br/>Best thing about the movie are its visuals. Not only the locations and make-up are great but also especially the CGI (Oscar win guaranteed I predict). It makes the movie a feast for the eyes that is just as entertaining as thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>So its not as entertaining or fun as the first, mainly because everything is not as fresh and surprising anymore but the action, CGI and better acting still make this movie a thrilling and entertaining roller-coaster ride that is just as good to watch as the first movie, because of this very reason. Also the cliffhanger made me excited for part 3; ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End"". I'm not going to spoil anything since I don't want to spoil the surprise for you.<br/><br/>Definitely a movie worth seeing that of course is best and most thrilling to be viewed while its still in cinemas.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

"dpogue21","3","2","6","9 July 2006"," At least it's better than Superman Returns
","Jack Sparrow owes Davy Jones his soul, and the producers of this movie owe me six dollars. The only thing that kept me from screaming words of vitriolic hate after this movie is that I am not capable of screaming because I recently saw Superman Returns and I am still trying not to throw up. In fact that is the only reason why I gave this movie 3 stars, because I wanted to emphasize that as much as this movie totally sucks, it's still at least two stars above Bryan Singer's shameless depiction of Jesus Christ Superman.<br/><br/>Basically, this movie amounts to five minutes worth of relevant plot that was dragged out into a two and a half hour film. A more accurate title for this movie would have been ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Setup for the Next Movie,"" because really that's all it was. The action scenes were a almost annoyingly over-the-top and drawn out, and some of it (i.e. the fight scene on the giant wheel from the mill) reminded me of watching a bad Jackie Chan movie. And while some people are undoubtedly going to say that Davy Jones and his barnacle people looked really neat, I think they were entirely too silly-looking to be threatening and would be more fitting as the bad guys in a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie. Not that the undead skeleton pirates from the first movie were realistic, but they are a hell of a lot easier to take seriously than some stupid-looking shellfish men. I mean if I were a pirate in the times of old, and I was confronted with an un-killable skeleton pirate, I would crap my pants with terror. However, if I were confronted with a stupid-looking hermit crab man, I'd shoot him in the face and then have crab legs for dinner. While Barbossa's ship in the first movie was a floating haunted house, Davy Jones's ship in this movie is more of a floating smorgasbord. Plus Barbossa was just a more believable and developed character than Davy Jones. My advice for the third movie is to go back to Barbossa and his skeleton pirates instead of a retarded piece of calamari that plays the piano with its face.<br/><br/>Lastly, there was one minor question that was burning through my mind the entire movie: why is the monkey still undead? All of the pirates affected by the curse in the first movie were turned back to normal men after the last piece of Aztec gold was restored, so why wasn't the curse lifted from the monkey? I hope they explain this in Pirates 3. Until then, here's hoping Kiera Knightley gets naked the next time around."
"OriginalMovieBuff21","8","2","6","8 July 2006"," Sparrow is back in an exciting sequel with more action and humour
","Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest is an entertaining sequel that takes off with Capt Jack Sparrow owing an unpaid debt to the monstrous Davy Jones and his army of sea phantoms. Sparrow has to find a way to save himself from becoming one of them by wrecking William and Elizabeth's wedding plans and forcing them to join Jack on another adventure. This is an exciting sequel that have made fans across the world happy. I enjoyed the film pretty well and I thought all the actors especially Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow to be the best just like in the first one. The only actor I thought was kind of boring would be Orlando Bloom and his overacting. Although, I thought the film was entertaining and funny, I don't think its close to being better than the first one. It felt way too long on some parts and I thought some scenes shouldn't of been included in the film. Overall, I thought Verbinski's sequel was good and had some pretty funny parts. But if your saying this is better than ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" I think your pretty wrong on that answer. I recommend it all and all though.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 7.5/10 *** B-"
"padredave618","5","2","6","8 July 2006"," A Let Down
","I write this to (A) vent a little, and (B) hope that Disney gets so much feedback they have to think about the next one. If the third film is already in the can I guess it won't matter much. My family was really looking forward to this sequel. The first really surprised me. It was so much fun, but Dead Man's Chest was not, in my opinion, a worthy follow up. The story seems to betray the work put into endearing these characters to us in The Curse of the Black Pearl. Jack was daring and fairly courageous in Curse, but spends most of this movie fleeing danger and abandoning his friends, the friends who stick up for him at the beginning of Dead Man's Chest. There was nothing I could find appealing about him in this one. His overtures to Elizabeth seemed totally out of place, and her betrayal of him at the end seemed to be equally out of place with her character. Given the story line I guess it fit, but it left me feeling they should have had a different storyline. Perhaps I am guilty of seeing more in Jack Sparrow than I should,yes I know it's a movie, but the purpose is draw us in, and leaving the audience feeling let down is not the purpose in making a film. They want to endear someone to us to draw us back. That's why Jack's pirate with an honest streak appeals. He did come back to the aid of his friends at the end, only to be shackled to the boat and left to face the monster alone BY ELIZABETH! Will's part was not bad, but not the role he had in the first either. Why was the East India Company able to overthrow an English governor and arrest him, only to need his help with the crown in the end? Why were soldiers following East India's orders? If the governor could be released to help in their plan he must not be in serious trouble with the crown. That bothered me. The other thing that bothers me is that the background and conspiracies and magical background was explained to the audience through thick accents that left me wondering what I had just heard. Perhaps that's why I am so confused about the whole East India thing, maybe I just couldn't follow the villains explanations. I am still confused on the whole Davy Jones heart/curse thing. My 13 and 12 year olds couldn't follow the plot unless I whispered explanations throughout. My 7 year old loved it, but he never gets the plot. He's there for the swords and there were plenty to thrill him. I hope that the 3rd installment will be so great that it will obscure this muddled attempt. Disney, I am not the only one saying this, so read and make the adjustments before this great trilogy is ruined. The last scene was great, I'll give them that."
"xredgarnetx","7","2","6","8 July 2006"," A dark and less funny sequel
","PIRATES 2 is an OK sequel to the original, with most if not all of the original cast back for another shot at buried treasure. This time around, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) and company are after Davy Jones'locker, which contains an artifact that will keep Sparrow from falling into the clutches of the undead Davy Jones. Davy Jones, who sports an octopus for a head, pilots the Flying Dutchman, which among other neat tricks can dive underwater. Along the way, Sparrow and friends (including a rather haggard-looking Orlando Bloom and the ever-luscious Keira Knightley) have various adventures including falling into the hands of cannibals. One eye-popping sequence involves a duel that takes place on a runaway water wheel! Now for the not-so-good news: P2 is considerably darker than the first movie. The (bloodless) death count is so high, PIRATES 2 truly is not suitable for small children. Also, the movie ends like THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, a cliffhanger that compels us to catch the third and final installment in 2007. Other than some impressive visual effects involving the gruesome Davy Jones crew and a rather large sea monster, there's not much new here. Many of the gags are lifted from the first movie. Plus the film is easily a half-hour too long. If you are a fan, by all means see it. Just keep the kiddies away."

","I generally don't like sequels however this is one of the best, the movie has more action and laughs than the first pirate movie, Johnny Depp shines as captain Jack once again, bring on number three. Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner wonderfully, and Jack Davonport is brilliant as Norrington. Keira Nightly's performance is a bit strained however it is still a great performance. It finishes leaving you wanting to see Pirates of the Caribbean number three as soon as possible. I think that the action was well performed with the right combination of action and comedy which the main characters have captured perfectly. Gore Verbanski is a true genius."
"tfrizzell","Null","2","6","7 July 2006"," Pi-Rights.
","Wonderfully fun and entertaining sequel dominates due to the technical aspects of film-making and always intriguing characters. Most everyone from the first installment returns as Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, arguably doing equal if not better work than in the original) has a debt to pay off to supernatural captain Davy Jones (the always outstanding Bill Nighy) or otherwise be condemned to an eternity of servitude on a ship of lost souls. Of course all this causes the wedding of Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley to be crashed and they get thrown back into high stakes adventure in the Caribbean. Director Gore Verbinski's franchise works most because of Depp as he becomes a cross between The Little Tramp, Detective Clouseau, Indiana Jones, James Bond and even Wile E. Coyote. Depp's character is one of the most textured and likable the cinema has ever seen (even though sometimes you don't know whether to love or loathe the guy). State of the art makeup effects, visual effects, editing, cinematography and art direction cover up the fact that the stories in the series are just window dressings to put seemingly every star and role player in breathtakingly action-packed dramatic and comedic sequences. While flawed (like its predecessor), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is a wickedly enjoyable summer blockbuster that does admittedly make me look forward to yet another inevitable installation. 4 stars out of 5."

Catch it in theatres, it will not be nearly as much fun watching on DVD.

There was never a moment where I was bored or tired. Everything seemed to be thought out by the directors, especially the fight sequences. However, the plot was a bit shaky and confusing, much like the first movie. This one was much darker and more frightening than the first. It's definitely not a movie for young children. As for the actors, Depp was great as the classic ""who's side is he on?"" Jack Sparrow; Elizabeth is a little more moody and seductive, and Will is great eye candy. I would definitely recommend seeing ""Dead Man's Chest"". It's pure summer entertainment."

I honestly couldn't believe all the hype.<br/><br/>Since I work for a cinema, I received a free early screening for ""Dead Man's Chest"". It is amazing. The acting is good, the computer effects are brilliant and eye-popping, the writing is entertaining and fun, Hans Zimmers score is better than ever, you have your action sequences that are superb, and perhaps most importantly, the stories all tie together. That's right. You have to watch the first to truly get all of the second. And you will need the combined knowledge of the first two to see third.<br/><br/>That is how you can separate the good trilogies from the bad. Good trilogies (LOTR, Back To The Future) seem like one big ongoing story. And now ""Pirates"" will join them.<br/><br/>I was really surprised by this gem. Good job Verbinski and Bruckheimer.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was a fast, exciting thrill ride. Jack Sparrow's daring and antics were a thrill. He almost managed to pursue Frodo all the way to the mountaintop, but not quite. Luckily Han Solo's craft whisked him away just in time. Someone shaved the wookie, but I guess that was okay, since the movie was about men's chests anyway, and men shave their chests all the time. But this was a wookie. Even so. It was a good thing Indiana hung onto that bridge when it was cut in half, or it all would have been over. Elizabeth was as good as usual, and it was a good thing that she won over the rich man and his mansion. Oh, and don't forget Will sword fighting to win his Princess Buttercup back. So all was happy in the end, ever after."

Perhaps it was this neutral attitude that Dead Man's Chest was so enjoyable but for even the biggest Pirates or Depp fans are going to be delighted with this.<br/><br/>From Jack's reuniting with the Pearl to the thunderous battle with Davy Jones' mutinous undead on vivid tropical sands, this is a $200m winner make no mistake because the box office take is going to explode and it only leaves you hungry for more upon it's cliffhanger crescendo that leaves plenty of questions unanswered and then asks a few more for good measure.<br/><br/>Never before have you desired to be a crusty, barnacled sea-urchin so much!"

","If the target audience is those in search of some good swashbuckling mindless fun with explosions it's a bullseye. If you were hoping to follow the plot - take a notepad along...<br/><br/>Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom are as they were in the first movie. The dynamic is still interesting, Jack Sparrow is still ducking and diving and is now so real I fear that if the wind changes Johnny Depp will stay like that. Rock on Keith! Yes, Keith Richard is truly the inspiration behind Johnny Depps portrayal of the role. In fact Keith Richards recently fell out of a coconut tree in Fiji. Which may explain the wonderful ""coconut"" moment early on in the movie. This movie does have many wonderful moments of humor both visual and verbal, which is just as well as you will need a degree in advanced linguistics to follow the plot which was frankly a little silly in places. For me the leading trio saved this movie. I already liked the characters and had laughed with them and at them. If this was the first movie - I'm not sure I'd have paid to see a second.<br/><br/>A couple of new items on the menu are worth mentioning; <br/><br/>Bill Nighy as Davy Jones. Bill, you need to have a word with the screenwriter. As Davy Jones you were not threatening, evil or evil-funny. You were the uncle who comes over and sits next to the fire and is a bit grumpy. I appreciate it is difficult to characterize when you have an octopus on your face - so that's when you really need the script and plot to communicate for you, and in this case, sadly it didn't. Namoie Harris as Tia Dalma. What a delight! Watch this lady - her career is going to sky rocket. She was the highlight of the movie for me. Comic timing, facial expressions and vocalization she knows exactly what she's doing, I was enchanted, I was no longer sitting in a cinema I was with her and totally absorbed.<br/><br/>So all in all - tighten up the script and simplify the plot for the next sequel, or leave more on the cutting room floor please. ...and by the way Keira is just starting to sound whiny and hysterically squeaky, I'd like to see her stronger and less squeaky in the next one. ...and yes, I'd like to see another one. For me the first was better, but this did not kill the franchise. It's a good fun movie - but you set my expectations higher Mr Verbinski, I'll forgive you once...but not twice."

","You can't go wrong with Pirates for a full-on and fun-filled romp. Having said that I don't think it's as a good as the original. There are too many sub-plots happening and it gets a tad confusing. The action is at times 'silly', even though I understand this is not a film to be taken seriously.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent, especially the costume/CGI of the crew of the Flying Dutchman. Some original thought has gone in to some of the action scenes so you will never be bored.<br/><br/>Depp is of course brilliant. Bloom is easily forgettable and Knightley doesn't get to do all that much. Bill Nighy is unrecognisable under the octopus costume however you can't mistake his voice or mannerisms.<br/><br/>Pirates is a bit too long, some scenes seem to drag on but the ending sets it up nicely for the third installment."
"keithbrown-90195","7","1","2","19 September 2016"," Overblown but Still A Lot of Fun
","It starts off knowingly acknowledging the fact that Pirates of the Caribbean and Jack Sparrow have become pop culture phenomenons in the years since the release of the first movie. It's a bit jarring, and watching it now after the fervor surrounding the series has died down certainly makes the winking more distracting than amusing. That quickly goes away though, and we're whisked away into a story that is all over the map, a tone that less elegantly dances between slapstick humor and grand adventure than the first movie, and a Jack Sparrow that no longer feels fresh.<br/><br/>Still, there's no denying that many of the set-pieces here are pretty astounding, especially for how they're handled simultaneously. I love the Kraken attacks, even if they go to that well maybe one too many times. The organ playing while the ship cracks in half is a great, epic moment. Then there's Davy Jones, a CGI creation that still looks great a decade later and Bill Nighy's performance which manages to feel human.<br/><br/>I think this one was my favorite when I used to watch these when I was younger. It's definitely the movie I where I developed a crush on Keira Knightley. I don't think it's my favorite anymore, but it still certainly carries a rangy sort of charm once the story kicks into gear about half an hour in."

He often acts the role of person which is crazy or looks addle-brained. I like his acting which despise somebody. But in serious scene he is always cool. The story is simple and we can understand it easily. And this film has many funny scene. The enemy is scared with the figure of monsters for children, but I think there are more scenes that are more interesting than the serious scene. I do not get tired even if long. Everybody enjoy watching it. The figure of monsters is made by the CG effect. It is very fantastic. It will be one of the factors that this movie is splendid.

","In the movie the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is reminded that he owes a debt to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the captain of the Flying Dutchman, a ghostly ship, with an undead crew. To escape a fate worse than death Jack must find the heart of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swan (Keira Knightly). If things weren't complicated enough, Will and Elizabeth are sentenced to hang, because they had helped Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to escape from the gallows. The only way to have the charges dropped is for Will to get Jack's magical compass and give it to Lord Cutler Beckett.<br/><br/>I think that the theme of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is that some people would do anything for the ones they care about. The reason I believe this is throughout the movie, many of the characters do things that could cost them their lives to save the ones that they care about. During the scene when Will Turner was on the Flying Dutchman, Will's dad, Bootstrap Bill, helped him escape even though there would be consequences. Throughout the movie, the use of makeup and special effects are used to give the pirates a realistic look. By using special effects on Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) and his pirate crew to make them look supernatural, fear struck all that saw them. The use of Makeup is also used on the rest of the cast to make them look like real pirates. In my opinion, when Will Turner saw how his dad looked he felt obligated to set him free. I do not think the movie would have had the same affect if he looked different. <br/><br/>The theme of the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is similar to the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, but with a new story line. In the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl, both Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan did things that they thought were right to keep each other safe. In my opinion, the writer did a good job representing theme. There are many people that would do anything to save the ones they care for. And even though it may not be right, in there mind it is."

It is difficult for me to divulge details without this being a spoiler to potential audience, so I'll pass on the other dozen or so laughable ""filler"" scenes you might encounter.<br/><br/>The romantic story between David Jones and his lover serves as a mere backdrop in the film, which ought to be elaborated in more detail, but it isn't, disappointingly. The great anticipated final battle between the pirates and the Dutch India Co is ""downsized"" to 2 ships blasting each other endlessly. There is not much in terms of twists comparing to the prequels; most are clearly foreseeable and come as no surprise.<br/><br/>The ending packs the greatest disappointment, yet, to Pirates fans. With some 10 mins left to straighten out what future holds for Will, Elizabeth, Sparrow, and Barbosa; as you can imagine, they end up being very cliché and not entirely exciting at all. Especially, the love affair between Will and Elizabeth should create outcries among fans.<br/><br/>The character built-up so meticulously done in the previous 2 movies is completely shoved over the cliff with the character of Barbosa (in addition to the monkey, Jack) trumping all the rest of the cast. Pirates 3 seriously should focus on what matters in the film and gradually build up to the end with great character development and twists and turns that leave the audience asking for more, as was the case in Pirates 1&2. Unfortunately, not so in 3. Many would find Pirates 3 to be a major let down.<br/><br/>Hence, my 5 stars."
"mr_facehead","5","1","2","8 June 2007"," This is entertainment
","This was a mildly amusing attempt at a Prates of the Caribbean sequel.<br/><br/>The first film was a quite respectable film, however, i think a lot of that was due to it's unique nature.<br/><br/>Some of the unusually spontaneous techniques used in the first movie, were to heavily worked on in this film, and it's excessive scripting eliminated the element of originality, and natural flow of scenes. Especially Johnny Depp's acting, which was relatively improvised in the first film. The dialogue and script of Dead man's chest includes a lot of Depp's mannerisms primarily improvised in The curse of the black pearl.<br/><br/>It was also a slightly uncreative, and half arsed attempt at banging out another action flick. Some of the movie quality was lost as the franchise turned into an absolute Hollywood blockbuster.<br/><br/>Despite this, i think it actually was more exciting than the first. It was quite entertaining, as it was jam packed full of entertaining scenes. I especially interested by Davy Jones and the flying Dutchman, which saw a fun look at sea mythology.<br/><br/>Although it was the most over the top thing ever, if you accept it for what it is, it's quite entertaining. It's obviously make believe, and not intended to be taken completely serious.<br/><br/>So, i recommend this film, but don't expect a spectacular piece of film work, just enjoy t."
"harsh_light","2","1","2","1 June 2007"," Where's the plot?
","Visually very good but about half an hour in I had the niggling feeling that something was missing, then I realised that the film was missing any sensible plot development. It is a series of set pieces very loosely set round the path of the film. The only way I can explain it is, as if Saving Private Ryan only consisted of a series of barely connected explosions and battles as they made their way from A to B to collect Ryan. But without any explanation of why. No character development, no storytelling or even any connection to WW2. No thinking required. Content wise it was dreadful, there is no substance to this film at all. All you need do to watch it is turn up. I'm not saying that some of the sillier bits didn't make me smile, but come on at least put a semblance of storyline in there if you want my money."
"film_riot","5","1","2","28 May 2007"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" provides some entertainment at the moment you watch it, but that's it. It is just an utterly forgettable film, the day after you've seen it you might not even remember what it really was about. All that stays in mind are some of the images and effects, and we have very often seen in the past few years that this is too less for a film with 145 minutes. Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow is surely the reason, why this film works at least on the humorous level some times, but also the fun factor does by far not reach the heights of the fresh ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"". The actors all deliver respectable performances, but the script doesn't really give them anything more to reach for. Gore Verbinski seems a little bit like a leasing worker who can make good work (""The Ring"", ""The Curse of the Black Pearl""), but only when he is given really good source material."
"d_sutaman","6","1","2","26 May 2007"," OK, but not great
","Pirates of the Carribbean: Dead Man's Chest was an enjoyable movie. It had many things to please a wide variety of views - action, adventure, comedy and romance.<br/><br/>However, the main problem found with this film was its length. It was 20 minutes or so too long. *SPOILER* The scene where those natives made Jack their God and stuff was completely unnecessary and didn't add to the story at all. I felt it ruined the flow of the film. *END OF SPOILER* If that scene were cut out, I would've given it a higher score. Also, there were a few plot holes which didn't really make sense. <br/><br/>Even though it Dean Man's Chest didn't live up to the flawless Curse of the Black Pearl, overall, it was a decent film."
"rhmccluskey","3","1","2","26 May 2007"," Grotesque and Tedious
","I found Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest to be imposingly grotesque and tedious. There are a few good moments of swordplay and windmill tipping. But in general the film was entirely avoidable. In the first of the series, the Jack Sparrow character was actually vulnerable and likable beneath his cavalier swagger. In this second of the series, the swagger remains but Jack Sparrow has been reduced to the level of petulant child. This version makes Will Turner's and Elizabeth Swann's prior and current admiration of Jack Sparrow completely implausible. We are supposed to believe that these people risked their lives, their love and everything they owned to save this guy??? I don't think so. I hope that the third film in the series returns to the grandeur and style of the first. If so, I would say, skip the Pirate's Chest and go directly World's End."
"kalikat2010","6","1","2","21 May 2007"," TERRIBLE!!!!!!! Did not live up to my expectations
","All in all, Pirates of the Caribbean did not meet my high expectations. The first movie had everything you could ask for in a movie: humor, action, a wee bit of drama and romance, and good actors without lousy, lame dialog. But the second movie, UGH! The dialog was strange and lame, not enough GOOD action scenes, and they made Kiera Knightly's acting seem way worse than it already is. Also, Davy Jones' tentacle beard was way too creepy and it moved too much. It was all I could look at when he was in a scene. The plot was under-developed and I didn't really care for the characters. They lazily stated why Johnny Depp got the black mark and hardly explained what the commodore was doing in the movie and why he was evil. The whole thing didn't make any sense!"
"csvjd","5","1","2","19 May 2007"," Dreadful
","If you like 'Potter' and 'Star Wars' flicks you'll be in your element. Dreadful acting, and a painfully slow, awkward plot highlight what may be one of the worst 'high budget' films in recent memory. The script is abominablethe dialogue is geared for cartoon viewers and contains every stereotype of a pirate known to man. The humor (or any attempt at it) is forced and clumsy at it's best. The film is clearly designed to cash in for the inevitable sequel and milk the crowd for doughas if that needs to be said. It is, sadly to say, a vehicle designed for two purposes: show off special effects (*yawn*); and rake in the money. On that basis, it succeeds only too well. Johnny Depp, casually walks his way through the role of Captain Jack Sparrow--if you look carefully you can see the pain in his eyes (admittedly it is hard to see to the casual observer as the pain is softened by the ridiculous amount of money for the part-- I'll bet you that was real rum in his bottle during the filming). Joe Lunchbucket and family will be happily entertained--because they won't have to think hard, if at all. If you're curious and want to see Johnny Depp in some of his better roles, I would suggest 'Blow' and 'Donnie Brascoe' -- two truly riveting roles. This is the last time I'll go for the 'Pirate' bait--you can have mine next time."
"Hancock_the_Superb","5","1","2","18 February 2007"," Overblown, Overlong, and Weak Sequel
","Picking up where we left off from the first film, the wedding day of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is interrupted when Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), director of the East India Trading Company, arrives in Port Royal, arresting them for aiding in the escape of Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from British authorities. Will is offered a pardon in exchange for tracking Sparrow down, and finds him and his crew stranded on an island where Sparrow is worshiped as a god by a tribe of cannibals. At this time, things are complicated by the arrival of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Captain of the ""Flying Dutchman"", who wishes to claim Jack's soul. Will takes his place instead, and meets with his father (Stellan Skarsgard), who has been imprisoned on the ship. Meanwhile, Jack must avoid the Kraken, the famous sea monster controlled by Jones, and contend with the scheming of James Norrington (Jack Davenport), who is trying to salvage his career by tracking down the heart of Davy Jones for Beckett - which will allow him to control the sea.<br/><br/>That plot grab you as ridiculously convoluted? Yeah, me too.<br/><br/>The problem with ""Dead Man's Chest"" is that it wears out the original's welcome. ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" worked because it was fresh and unexpected - this film is essentially a rehash, with a great deal of superfluous and digressive nonsense going on. The flaws of the first film - particularly the excessive length - are greatly amplified, and the charm that the first film had is largely missing. It isn't an out-and-out bad film, but it doesn't come close to the original. It seems primarily to serve as a set-up for the third film, more than anything else.<br/><br/>A great deal of what the original got right is screwed up by this film. The humor of ""Black Pearl"" is almost absent; most of the so-called funny sequences are forced, and just plain not funny. The action scenes range from serviceable (the Kraken attacks) to over-the-top and ridiculous (any scene involving a cannibal cage or spinning water wheel). The special effects are ridiculously over-done, particularly on Davy Jones' crew. Jones himself is an impressive bit of CGI makeup, with his octopus face, as is Bootstrap Bill, but the rest of the crew is just too ridiculous to take seriously. And the long, digressive cannibal scenes in the first hour add absolutely nothing to the film.<br/><br/>The film's biggest failing is in Jack Sparrow. While I loved Depp's performance in the first film, his was a character who, for the casual fan (i.e., one who is not obsessively in love with Johnny Depp), could quite easily wear out his welcome. And such is the case here; Jack is not funny, or even really interesting, for most of the running time. Depp does what he can, and as he is a very talented actor I think the screenplay is to blame for this. There is an interesting bit of character development, as he opts to return and fight with his shipmates rather than save himself towards the end, but that's too little, too late.<br/><br/>Most ridiculous of all, the entire last half-hour is setting up a cliff-hanger to be resolved. Even trilogy movies like ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" have definite climaxes, despite that fact that we know there will be a sequel; this film tries, but fails to do so. Cliff-hangers are acceptable in TV shows, not so much in films. And if I'm reading it right - that Jack Sparrow will be brought back from the dead by some magic spell - then the idiots running the show have really dropped the ball by making me leery about the third film, rather than excited. And what in the hell is with the romance angle between Elizabeth and Jack? <br/><br/>The acting is nothing special either. Depp, as mentioned, does an admirable job with a poorly written part; I hope that for the third film he will get better material. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley both show again that they lack for both talent or screen presence (some may beg to differ, but that's my story and I'm sticking to it). With Jack shunted to the background for much of the story they take center stage, and the film suffers because of it. They may bring in the teen girls but others will be less than thrilled. Bill Nighy is good as Davy Jones - as good as one can be when your performance is 90% CGI - and Stellan Skarsgard adds a lot of dignity to his role of Bootstrap Bill. Kevin McNally is again able to make something out of an underwritten character, while Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook's doubles-act as two idiot pirates wears thin. Tom Hollander's Beckett periodically pops in, as if visiting from another film, and despite a good performance he has next to nothing to do. Jack Davenport at least gets some interesting character development to work with, but Jonathan Pryce again gives a nice, quiet performance that is nonetheless unremarkable. On the other hand, Naomie Harris as Tia Dalma, the voodoo priestess, manages to make the most of her two-dimensional role, and ends up being one of the film's most memorable characters.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", despite it's massive box-office success, is at best a very mixed bag. It's watchable but nothing special, though die-hard ""Pirates"" fanatics won't really care. Others might be a little leery about going into this one. Let's just hope that the third film, ""At World's End"", gets us back to the fun of the original. Here's hoping...<br/><br/>5/10"

","Most of the movie was amazing, once again like the previous movie, I enjoyed this one very much. Some negatives to this movie however, in which it cannot compare to it's predecessor. First of all, I felt ""the kraken"" effects in some scenes were quite unrealistic - I won't mention which scenes to avoid spoilers. Also, I don't know if it was only me, but I did notice that Johny Depp's performance in this movie was nothing compared to his performance in the previous Pirates of the Caribbean. Seems he didn't put a lot of effort into it this time, didn't seem like he was really ""Jack Sparrow"" anymore. The movie was quite good, but the end was quite disappointing. I would have wished to see the conclusion of that - but I guess I can wait 5-6 months to see it now. Other than that, great work and great acting by the cast. Recommend to everyone if you're a big fan of Pirates of the Caribbean - and even if you're not, this one you definitely won't want to miss."

","I wasn't really that impressed with the second film as all it did was regurgitate the same characters from the first with the exception of Lord Beckett and Tia Dalma (freakin hottie btw), plus, I know this is more of a Jerry Bruckheimer film than a Disney picture. The movies seemed to lack the one thing Disney is still good at,taste. Robert Iger,if your reading this,don't let outside producers like Bruckheimer come in and hijack a great movie franchise we all fell in love with and ruin the third one.

","I have seen this movie twice (once in theaters and once at home) and each time I loved it. It was very humorous and the action was very fun to watch, especially the fight on top the win mill. The CGI was stunning(but not overused as in some films), but Davy Jones and his crew stood out as the best in the film as far as computer generated imagery go's. The acting was superb and Johnny Depp doesn't disappoint. Orlando Bloom plays Will Turner as his character should be played and Kiera Knighting does great as well. Pirates 2 has a good storyline and a great twist at the end. I liked the gambling game on Davy Jone's ship and was happy to see ""Boot Strap"" Bill Turner and Will meet. I liked how Jack Sparrow gets caught by the ""beastey"", but am frustrated (as are lots of others) that we don't know what happens.

","'Pirates Of The Caribbean - Dead Man's Chest' is but the second installment (the third has already been shot) in the series of movies based on a Disneyland ride: strange nidus for a story idea and one that takes a bit of patience to sit through, but a fun evening nevertheless. Though the first installment took the audience by surprise with the character of Jack Sparrow so inimitably portrayed by the gifted Johnny Depp and therefore served as a tastier treat, this second installment substitutes sea-dead cum barnacles for the dancing skeletons of the first and is a bit more grisly...and a lot less fun.<br/><br/>But Gore Verbinski knows how to choreograph these outings and he is able to marry some very fine special effects to the genuinely good cast of characters and the result is a fantasy that is a visual delight. The cast includes Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Bill Nighy who is completely covered in tentacles as Davy Jones, Jonathan Pryce, Tom Hollander, Stellan Skarsgård,and Naomie Harris and they all seem to be having a glorious time. It is a bit long for a slight story (well in excess of two hours) and the special effects of the kraken (octopus like tentacles) overwhelming boats becomes tedious, but it is a fun outing and it all too blatantly sets us up for part three due our next spring.

"dwpollar","4","1","2","26 November 2006"," Action-packed sequel to the Disney-ride original...
","1st watched 11/26/2006 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Gore Verbinski): Action-packed sequel to the Disney-ride original in an obvious 2nd out of 3 movies in this series. We follow our favorite anti-hero Pirate, Jack Sparrow thru his goofy exploits on the sea as he tries to recover a key to open the chest that houses the actual beating heart of the un-dead computer-animated octopus-faced ""Davy Jones"". His reason for recovering it is to pay him back on what he owes him. Jones is the leader of a ghostly gang aboard the floating Dutchmen that terrorizes the ocean seeking souls to join his undead crew. There are, I think, another 3 or 4 people looking for the same object for different reasons(all for their own safety I must say). The action is definitely almost non-stop with a couple of humorous sets and a couple of good lines from the Rolling stones impersonating Pirate, played by Johnny Depp. The problem with this movie is that we know who's going to make it out of every hair-raising situation so there's no suspense. And as far as drama, forget about itinstead we have a few people searching for an elusive trinket to help them out of their own particular predicament and people getting into situations way over their heads for the sake of their own interests. But of course, everything will work out for all of our most popular swashbuckling characters, as long as you keep watching even through the 3rd movie of course. There was definitely a lot of money put into the computer-animated special effects and the choreography of the fight sequences had to take some work, but who really cares?? In my opinion, this is just another Hollywood money-making machine so let's all join the cause and wait until the 3rd one is available for free somewhere before we watch it Who's with me??"
"DrFontane","7","1","2","25 November 2006"," Did you love part one? Well, you'll like this one.
","You have probably all seen the first film and loved it, like all normal people did, but if you read this, there's a 50% chance you're wondering ""but what's the deal with Pirates 2?"". Well, in short, part 1 was brilliant, part 2 is pretty great.<br/><br/>It doesn't happen very often that I love a film from the first time I see it, but Pirates of the Caribbean was one of them. I fell in love with it from the start. But, part two (and three) were announced, and the people among us that love films know that sequels can really ruin it. I'm a very difficult guy to please with films (and pretty much anything else), so I think there should be some credibility when I say they did an OK job.<br/><br/>If The Curse of the Black Pearl deserved a 9, I rate this one 7,5. Still a very good score, if you ask me. But why is there 1.5 points difference, well several reasons. Dead Man's Chest is a bit less mature, or a bit more Hollywood than The Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>The use of fantasy has increased. Part one had unrealistic elements, but part two stretches to fantasy (of which the CGI has definitely improved since part one, may I add). Speaking of stretching, the story is all stretched out. While I have no real problems with the duration because I enjoy it so much, it could've easily been cut 20 minutes shorter. Especially considering the story doesn't end in this one. But there is still some good writing at times, and even though it's not as captivating as part one, you'll still enjoy it. They tried to make it seem like the story was meant to continue, and they succeeded in making it seem like that.<br/><br/>The jokes are more obvious and if you compare it to part one, they could bother you. Because a lot of small jokes are surrealistic things. Things that would never happen in real life. I won't give any examples, because I don't want to spoil. But Jack as well, you might sometimes get the feeling they're overdoing him. I did have that feeling once or twice. But it's still Jack Sparrow, and you'll still love him. They haven't fked him up, don't worry. And there's another character, Davy Jones. If you are familiar with Bill Nighy's strange ways, you'll know that he fits in this film and is a lovable character as well.<br/><br/>One last thing I'd like to mention is the ending of the film. You will probably not like it, I warn you. But let's hope for part three to make it all up.<br/><br/>So, people who hate this one just have to get over it. It's still an enjoyable entertaining film, just see it for yourself."

","I was looking forward to seeing this movie. I had a great time with the previous Pirates and saw that movie a few times over the years without tiring of it.<br/><br/>But this movie had noting in common with the previous one. It had pirates, sea and beaches, but otherwise it had nothing of the well-balanced and fun storyline of the previous film. It was dark, grim and unsympathetic. Despite it being a Disney film, I wouldn't recommend it for kids. People die. A lot. In a variety of nasty scenarios. And as seems to be the trend with trilogies, it hardly had any plot at all. It felt like an uninspired filler between the beginning and the end of the Pirates-saga."

","This sequel is nothing to it's predecessor. Its complex plot line is way to hard to follow. It will leave viewers minds confused. The twist of brining barbosa back was not a good thing. It totally undose the plot of the first one. The actors hung in there though ,and tried to pull off this compelex confusion of a story. Yes, all the scenery and score were still top rate ,but the plot line is what makes or brakes a story. In this case it broke it. The Governor would of never been treated so cruelly, and even though it's funny the Commander would not have ended up a poor drunk. This movies research definitely went to the swine. Yes, pearls ,no pun intended, definitely were cast to pigs."
"doctorx2","8","1","2","30 September 2006"," A rollicking, big-action sequel
","Wow, another $equel. What can one really $ay about that? Well, blame $tar War$ and Lord of the Ring$, after all, Disney didn't invent the franchise. That being said, I was expecting the worst (and certainly heard it from all the critics) before seeing this film. Maybe that is why I enjoyed the film so very much, and found that the time flew by (unlike my recent experience watching another ""super"" film of similar length, during which I kept feeling that my seat was uncomfortable, and kept looking at my watch). Pirates was, after all, never intended to be anything more than a tongue-in-cheek joy-ride based on, well, a tongue-in-cheek joy-ride. And it does move right along. Without giving away too much, I will say that I found the opening scene unexpectedly artsy and engaging, likewise the immediate introduction of major plot elements; and the introduction of new characters refreshing and intriguing. Androgynous Depp delivers again as the mincing and nasty Captain Jack Sparrow, and (IMHO) the wimpy and boyish Bloom nonetheless comes across as likable once again in the role of young Will Turner. Keira Knightley is eminently watchable, perhaps even reading the telephone directory aloud, but here her character, Elizabeth Swann, is spiced up a bit (e.g., taught how to sword-fight, an absurd idea, but let's not even go there). It's always a pleasure to see Jonathan Pryce (Brazil, say no more), and likewise Bill Nighy, who by now has ample on-screen experience playing the undead (Shaun of the Living Dead) and bad guys (The Constant Gardener), but whose real gift lies in ironic timing and subtle (or not-so-subtle) humor (Love Actually). Pirates newcomer Naomie Harris is a treat as the scary but sexy voo-doo queen Tia Dalma.<br/><br/>As in the first installment of Pirates, the costumes and sets are lavish and appealing; the ships are believable enough (hey, this isn't Master and Commander), and the action is a-plenty. Also as in the first film, some of the fights go on much too long, and there is more BIG action than necessary, but both are forgivable within the genre (which is, in case you forgot, theme park ride). Nighy's Davy Jones is fantastic, due in no small part to the Disney CG guys. <br/><br/>A side note for the literate among us: as in the first Pirates film, much is borrowed from Tim Powers' On Stranger Tides, a fact that no one will dispute after seeing this film. I won't tell you what to look for, you'll know. I was dismayed not to see any screen credit given Powers. Nonetheless, don't be surprised if the Fountain of Youth somehow plays into the third film.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: well worth seeing on the big screen. I might even go see it again."
"taykienjean","7","1","2","27 August 2006"," Captain Jack Sparrow is back!
","Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley are taking their roles too seriously. Although Keira has achieved an Oscar standard in Pride & Prejudice, I do not think she puts in enough effort in here. Her hair cut is being shortened suddenly due to her role in Domino and the screenplay changes with her hair style as a temporary male pirate.<br/><br/>Academy Award winner Geoffrey Rush is just for a second only right at the end, and we will need the final installment Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End to judge this film and the trilogy as a whole.<br/><br/>The fighting scenes in the first island are of wasting time. It is as if like purposely longer the total running time and yet it serves as the funniest part of the movie. They could have presented it in a better way.<br/><br/>This film have achieved numerous box office record this year as well as in the film history, perhaps the film makers have made us wait too long. We will need to be patient to see what and how they will present Chow Yun Fat in the last installment next year.<br/><br/>I strongly believe that no one actor can fight with Johnny Depp's electrifying performance seen everywhere since The Curse of the Black Pearl, he is really good and he earns praises from Jerry Bruckheimer, Gore Verbinski, Chow Yun Fat, major cast and crew and film critics worldwide. According to the producer, if there is no Captain Jack, there will be no Pirates to be filmed.<br/><br/>My prediction for next year's Oscar, at least to be nominated in Best Actor in a Leading Role (Johnny Depp), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (BAFTA double winner cum Golden Golbe nominee Bill Nighy), Achievement in Visual Effects, Cinematography, Sound Mixing, Suound Editing, Makeup, Costume Design and Art Direction.<br/><br/>Overall the film is highly entertaining and the interaction between Captain Jack Sparrow with others is humorous!

To answer ""why?"" it is prudent to list some of the things I think made the first one so great. 1- it was original. That's probably one of its strongest points. The storyline and characters were all very unique and original. Nothing in there we have heard before. 2- it had humor. Not that the second one doesn't, but going back to the originality the humor in the first was fresh. The second time around just isn't as funny. 3- it had a very decisive narrative arch (beginning middle and end). The second was lacking to varying degrees in all three of those categories.<br/><br/>This will have spoilers. You've been warned.<br/><br/>The second one lacks originality. This will go without saying to some degree given that it is a sequel of the first, but I am more referring to the same themes that repeat themselves in the second from the first. Like someone sleeping with pigs getting woken with a bucket of water, the rum being gone, and of course the whole thing having freaky looking enemies with the odds stacked completely against you. There are others, this is just to name a few. Many repeat themselves in one-liners or small tidbits like ""Why is the rum always gone?"" as mentioned before.<br/><br/>I think another thing that bothers a lot of people is how this movie ended (or rather didn't). Watching Jack's grim fate and then ending with promise of a voyage to World's End with the returning Captain Barbossa is hardly a satisfying spot to halt the movie. It's like hitting a brick wall, just too sudden. I know it's priming us for the last one to come out next summer but I hate ""to be continued"" endings and I think I'm not alone.<br/><br/>The beginning felt slow to really explain what was happening and to get something happening. I don't like the way they portrayed Norrington in this one. He was not a bad person in the first one, just one who has lived his life bound by and following the rules (which makes him uptight, but he was still respectable). In the second one he seems completely without honor. The scene with the cannibals was cute, the rolling ball scene was a little much. Later, the sword fight on the water wheel was a bit too much as well.<br/><br/>The good stuff- yes, Captain Jack is back and he's as good as ever. The graphics are once again amazing. It is fun to watch and you get into it. It leaves you wanting to watch the next one."
"petit-oiseau","7","1","2","6 August 2006"," Quite different from the original.
","Nobody expected the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie to do well. After all, it was a movie based on a Disney theme park ride, opening in the middle of the summer , starring Johnny Depp as a pirate and some British virtually-unknowns in the supporting cast. But against all odds, it went on to make over $300 million dollars at the US box office alone, spawning two sequels and a pop-culture phenomenon.<br/><br/>I went into the theater expecting a fun, light-hearted romp much along the lines of the first film. I was surprised, but not entirely disappointed.<br/><br/>The major problem with Dead Man's Chest is that it takes itself far too seriously. The spoofy, almost campy quality that made Black Pearl so fun is gone, replaced with generous amounts of CGI fighting and backstory. When we leave the theater, we feel as if we've seen half of a Lord of the Rings or Narnia style-movie that takes place at sea.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Johnny Depp is as drunk and delightful as ever in the role of (Captain) Jack Sparrow. You can really tell how much he's enjoying himself and just having a good time, something that his co-stars don't seem to be doing. Orlando Bloom as Will Turner is as stiff and wooden as ever, and although his lady love Keira Knightly (Elizabeth Swan) shows more signs of life, her dress seems to get more screen time than she does. The newcomers don't fare any better, Davy Jones (can't remember the guy's name) and Bootstrap Bill (ditto)seem perfectly happy wallowing in their angst in a movie that doesn't need any more angst than the script gives it.<br/><br/>Speaking of the script, all I can say is, move a bit faster. Dead Man's Chest seems quite long for its two and a half hours, and the fact that the first hour or so of it doesn't advance the plot hardly at all doesn't help. The movie doesn't resolve itself either, basically ending with ""Oh, Jack's dead! Let's resurrect Barbossa. The End . . . for now!"" <br/><br/>All in all, go into this movie expecting a decently plotted but overlong and overserious action-adventure. Johnny Depp is excellent, not much else is."
"ozymandiaskingofkings","6","1","2","2 August 2006"," Pretty much the same as the first...
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest The Oxford English Dictionary defines amnesia as ""A severe loss of memory characterised by the inability to recall whole blocks of time"" and after watching this film I felt as if I was suffering from this condition, as I could recall very little of what I had just seen. I know that I enjoyed the film because I felt happy afterwards and was strangely compelled to shout ""Yarr!"" rather like ""Dodgeball""'s Steve the Pirate but I can only remember certain scenes from it. I think the reason for this bizarre affliction (bizarre because I have no trouble recalling most films) is that the lack of a cohesive narrative in ""Dead Man's Chest"" to bind together the admittedly mouth watering eye-candy on display.<br/><br/>Let me just demonstrate how confusing, or rather confused, things are: Set a few years after the first film, C18th Capitalist juggernaut The East India Trading Company has issued death warrants for the arrest of Will Turner, Elizabeth Swan and Jack Sparrow following their escape stunt in the first film and commandeers Port Royal. It's chief Lord Beckett is an unscrupulous arse who offers to amnesty Will and Elizabeth in exchange for Jack Sparrow's compass which points to the eponymous ""Dead Man's Chest"" a quasi-mythical box containing the heart of Hibernian Squid-demon Davy Jones (the nefarious captain of ghost ship ""The Flying Dutchman"", not the lead singer of ""The Monkees""). With this heart Davy Jones, and more importantly his beastie, the kraken, would be under Beckett's command, but Jack Sparrow also wants the heart so that he can erase a debt of his soul, which he owes Jones. Elizabeth is in prison and so Will sets out to find Jack but he gets forced into joining Jones' cursed in order to get his hands on the chest's key, aided by his undead father Bootstrap Bill. Meanwhile Elizabeth escapes and sets out to find Will, disguising herself as a boy aboard the ship of that-bloke-from-Taggart-who-isn't-Taggart and heading for Tortuga. There she catches up with Captain Jack and they are confronted by James Norrington, now disgraced and vengeance obsessed, who joins Jack's crew with mutiny on his mind That's only about half the plot but I imagine by now you're reaching for Tolstoy for something simpler. A further problem arises in that the film doesn't only try to tell this story, but is also full of redundant scenes that stretch the things out to a ridiculous 2 ½ hour length. Case in point: the 20 minute cannibal island sequence which is only present as comic relief to younger viewers and has NOTHING to do with the narrative whatsoever. This is not to say however, that the film doesn't have any good points because it does, but the similarity between the curse plot line of this and the first film is a little too similar. That said, it is tonally darker than the first film, with the emphasis being more on death than life and the rain drenched opening contrasts starkly with the sunny idyllic Port Royal of ""Black Pearl"".<br/><br/>The problem is that this being a kids' movie we don't see as much as the more sinister locations as we'd like to. For example just before Jack is reintroduced (probably the best character entrance ever) we are shown the outside of a hellish Bastille style prison fort with crows pecking the eyes out of men in gibbets, yet just as our interest is aroused we are shown no more. The same is true of Davy Jones' magnificent CGI ""Flying Dutchman"" which is pretty seldom glimpsed. Having said that, the film is visually stunning in almost every respect, the production design creating a relatively convincing portrait of 1700s dress, locations and architecture.<br/><br/>There are also some highly impressive action sequences within the film, notably an epic and very lengthy swordfight between Jack, Will and Norrington, that could have made Errol Flynn jealous and an extremely suspenseful onslaught on the Black Pearl by the kraken as well as a great sequence in which almost all the characters are involved in a mass scramble for the chest with Davy's troops.<br/><br/>The acting is also largely excellent. Johnny Depp once again greatly impresses as rockstar pirate Captain Jack while Bill Nighy is magnificently sinister as the squid like demon Davy Jones. Keira Knightley is also great as tomboyish Elizabeth and I defy any man not to fall in love with her. Orlando Bloom is still as wooden as the Black Pearl but at least his character has been allowed to take on some complexity as he accepts his role in bigger events. The actor who really steals the film though is Jack Davenport as ex-commodore Norrington, a character that has undergone a startling metamorphosis from Nelson-like man of honour to self-loathing devil-may-care bounty hunter. While in the first film he was by the book and uptight, he is now a vengeful drunk who will (and does) stop at nothing to regain his former glory and as such is probably the most well rounded character in the film.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film is too much like its predecessor, without the originality or tight plotting needed to keep it afloat (no pun intended) but its entertaining while it lasts and the cliff-hanger ending will guarantee you'll be going back next summer for part 3.<br/><br/>3.5/5"
"MichelleDeblinger","6","1","2","2 August 2006"," Repulsive looking Davy Jones but Captain Jack is still a Charmer
","I'm a big Johnny Depp fan and a BIG Captain Jack Sparrow Fan (I even have a Captain Jack Sparrow T-shirt I wear all the time). This being the case, I don't think it would've been possible for me not to have liked Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest at all. However, I was hoping to come away from the movie just as excited about it, as I was after seeing Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl, but I wasn't. The sequel fell short of the originality and nonstop excitement we got in the first.<br/><br/>The biggest disappointment in Dead Man's Chest is the character of Davy Jones played by Bill Nighy. It seems ironic that Jack Sparrow's character was a sure sign of genius and ingenuity from the creative mind of Johnny Depp, and is what made Pirates of the Caribbean the phenomenon it is today. Yet in the sequel, someone came up with a repulsive looking Davy Jones who is half man/half sea creature. He had the characteristics of cross-between a Star Wars and Lord of the Rings monster with eyes befitting a mass murderer from some horror flick. I found it difficult to look at the screen when there were close-ups of him, which was often. Bootstrap Bill's character, played by Stellan Skarsgård wasn't as bad, but unimpressive as well. He looked like some kind of freak in a costume someone would throw together on Halloween night.<br/><br/>Other than a few characters missing, the cast from Curse of Black Pearl was in Dead Man's Chest and it was enjoyable to see an ensemble of the old delightfully original and charismatic characters again.<br/><br/>As for Captain Jack Sparrow, well as can be expected he was the star of the show; however, Depp appeared to play the character with less flamboyance and animation this time around. I wondered if Depp might have enjoyed pretending to be a real-life pirate more in Curse of the Black Pearl than he did in Dead Man's Chest. The thrill of it all might have faded just a bit, which wouldn't be hard to understand considering Johnny Depp's apparent need for unusual, offbeat and eccentric roles.<br/><br/>The best part of the Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest is the ending which makes you leave the theater wishing the Part III sequel was playing the next day. There is an unexpected twist that will keep you wondering how it will play out in the sequel.<br/><br/>Bottom line... Is it worth seeing? Yes. Is it as good as the first? Unfortunately not. Will I see Part III? You bet!"

","Rating: 12A Main Cast: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Bill Nighy Director: Gore Verbinski<br/><br/>The good: massive epic scale, brilliant set pieces and action sequences, Bill Nighy is amazing.<br/><br/>The bad: Orlando Bloom, not as funny as previous film, bit confusing, tries to cram in too much.<br/><br/>Quick Summary: This is no Toy Story sequel, this is a Matrix sequel. This film lacks the originality and humour of the first, and Johnny Depp seems to have been forced to be annoying at every possible point. In the first he was funny, now the writers have written him like he performed and he now just gets annoying! The effects are decent though look a bit cartonney, Orlando Bloom cant act and Keira Knightley is probably just there to look pretty.

"little_pink_sock","6","1","2","30 July 2006"," Somewhat disappointing, but still worth seeing
","To begin with, the plot was too incoherent. Why was Jack in a floating coffin in the beginning? Why did he owe Davy Jones his soul? (By which I mean, what did he promise to do in those 13 years that he failed to do?) Did Elizabeth fall for Jack, or not? That last question i'm assuming they left intentionally ambiguous. But a little more explanation on some of the other stuff would be nice.<br/><br/>It was *way* too gross. If nothing else, they had way way way too many shots of the crows pecking at the men in the cages at the beginning. It was completely unnecessary. The kraken was rather cool, and Davy Jones i can concede was interesting, but the crew members were not. They were gross and completely unrealistic looking. Add to that the fact that there was not enough screen time of Jack just being Jack, they overplayed the overly verbose speech habits (primarily in the beginning), the incomprehensible dice game (tho that may just be me being slow), and the fact that the soundtrack (although still beautiful) sounded like the original one recycled with a couple of organ pieces thrown in, and I'm left feeling a bit let down by this one.<br/><br/>My friend would also like me to add that the accents were occasionally difficult to understand (which I disagree with, the only thing I ever had trouble with was Barbosa's ""me holds are bursting with swag"" line in the first movie), and it was too long (which I do agree with).<br/><br/>However, there were some awesome fight scenes, some very amusing jokes (especially those that were throwbacks to the first movie), and a couple of incredibly hot actors, and one very hot actress, so the movie was not terrible by any stretch of the imagination. It simply lacked *something* which the first movie had, that made it worth going back and watching over and over. I enjoyed it, but ultimately walked away feeling more let down than impressed."
"extravaluejotter","4","1","2","30 July 2006"," The Difficult Second ""POTC""
","The first POTC film left us with a lot of high expectations. Wonderful production design, effective script, good cast, impressive special effects and some great stunt work left audiences wanting more. In the second film, we definitely get more.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""More"" doesn't always mean ""Better"". There are a lot of stunts, some of which are breathtaking. After a while, however, the stunts lose their ability to impress because there are so many of them. It's the same with the special effects. ""Dead Man's Chest"" features a lot of CGI. The semi-aquatic crew of the ""Flying Dutchman"" are more than a match for the first film's undead pirates, but they have so much time on screen that they lose their shock value as the film progresses. <br/><br/>What luck then, that the film is blessed with such a wonderful cast. Johnny Depp and co have put a lot of effort into their roles and it shows through the easy chemistry that they all share. Despite the odd longueur here and there, it's the cast that kept me watching, even when the plot appeared to be completely at sea. Unfortunately the charm of Johnny Depp et al has a very limited shelf life. I can watch ""The Curse of The Black Pearl"" again and again but ""Dead Man's Chest"" will never make it into my DVD collection.<br/><br/>We know that there's a third film and this one sets us up for it, with a cliffhanger ending and the brief introduction of a figure from the past. To be honest, I didn't bother finding out what happened in ""At World's End"" because you can only spend so long watching a bunch of showbiz chums having fun before you start to wonder why you're not having any fun yourself."

","I loved the first Pirates of the Caribbean. Loved the acting the humor and the interesting twists and turns...and couldn't wait for this one. Darn. I love Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom and I hated this movie. It was the slapstick version of the original. What if we all acted like the Three Stooges and re-made the movie. And it's not the actor's fault. It's probably Disney's fault...certainly the writers and directors and the folks that could have said Stop! The character of Captain Jack disappeared somewhere in the bad comedy though he did a great job with what he had to work with. Orlando Bloom was in it wasn't he? With a few excellently delivered lines (he can't do otherwise) he seemed to be kind of melded into the special effects. And for anyone who saw Underworld...come on Davy Jones! get a new character! we could see you through your huge makeup and we wanted to see someone else. Too much CGI. Too little of what we watch Pirates to see...Johnny Depp...acting...being Captain Jack... I was greatly disappointed. Sorry. I hate saying bad stuff about people I love. Lots of good people (I have to exclude K. Knightly...someone please tell her how to hold her face naturally and quit with the lip thing...)with not much to do. I do hope the next one is so much better. And, I am glad there will be a next one."
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","22 July 2006"," Swashbuckling returns huge but lacks the heart ironically enough
","I had very high expectations for Pirates 2 Dead Man's Chest. I did know if not subconsciously that Pirates 2 would most certainly suffer from being a sequel let alone the middle installment of a trilogy. Now don't get me wrong...Dead Man's Chest still captures and delivers the swashbuckling adventure, returns many, if not nearly all the original members of the cast including some obscure ones (the Undead Monkey.) The film also does a terrific job and melding together the first and second films keeping a very close eye on linking them properly and having a continuous storyline. The film has some truly amazing fight scenes and stunt scenes (although not as many as the original) and some of the characters get a big boost into the spotlight. But when all is said and done the plot of the second film is a little bit complicated and must be very closely followed, the villain as creepy and crazy as he looks doesn't near have the heart or talent of the irreplaceable Geoffrey Rush, and some of the main characters including the infamous Captain Jack Sparrow have lost some of their heart. BUT the CGI is greatly improved considering the enormity of the special effects, the setting is still perfect and the adventure soars!! <br/><br/>Johnny Depp probably set his career high as the anti-hero Jack Sparrow. He will be a movie classic character forever and no one but Depp could play him. It's a brilliant role and he HAD to return. There was no shortage of Jack Sparrow action and he still is great but it just seemed like he lacked the heart that he had for the character in the original. I suppose some of that would come from this being not the creation of a unique character but rather carrying him over. Some of the scenes felt a little forced to try and re-establish Jack's outlandish personality. He also felt less like the reluctant hero in this film and more like a true blood Pirate with a bit of an evil side to him which doesn't really fit Jack Sparrow...he just didn't seem himself. Orlando Bloom returns as high spirited youngster William Turner. Now Bloom perfectly captures the character he created in the original. Turner is the perfect hero, swash buckling, a little bit of pirate but honorable and handsome. Although I will say people tend to get the better of him more often than not in this film especially in a sword fight. Depp and Bloom have lost all their chemistry they shared with their reluctant friendship in the first one. They seem more like enemies now unfortunately. Someone whose character really blossomed in this second film is the lovely Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann. Swann who was a strong female lead in the original really gets to kick some butt and poke fun at the female persona in the 1800's. She's sassy, strong and quite striking in this film. (My male opinion of her had dropped significantly after Domino BLECH!!) She gets far more swordplay of her own, some really great action scenes and a more significant role. Unfortunately they make her character less credible and destroy the intense romance between Will and her with a sub plot about her lust for Jack Sparrow. Bill Nighy plays the entirely CGI'd evil villain Davy Jones. He does well but just doesn't hold your attention like Geoffrey Rush did with his villain. He certainly looks evil enough and plays a big part in the overall plot of this film, the earlier film and the next one by the sounds of things. Stellan Skarsgård makes a reasonably important and very well acted appearance as Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's Father. Talked about in length in the first one but this is his first appearance. Skarsgård is an effective actor and is a very emotional character in this role. Jack Davenport makes an interesting return as former Commander Norrington. He is another of the characters who definitely got more of a break out role. He's villainous and yet one of the good guys in many ways. He is also vitally important to the next film and how everything unfolds.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is definitely not without it's 300 million dollar (and climbing) charm. There is truly some memorable moments including the sword fight on the enormous water wheel and the escape from the hanging cage made from crew members bones. As a sequel and in that vein it is quite well done and very worth seeing if there is anyone left on the face of the planet who hasn't seen it. It reminds me a great deal of the original Star Wars trilogy each one establishing characters, romance, intrigue, action and a beloved ship...Millennium Falcon vs The Black Pearl. I don't know if Pirates will capture the hearts like Star Wars did but so far it's a terrific series but absolutely make sure you see the superior original before seeing this sequel. Altogether so far it's been fun!! 8/10"

","Back in the company of Captain Jack Sparrow, (Johnny Depp) we are again taken on an escapade of the melancholy and mischievous sort. This time Jack is on a search for the the Dead Man's Chest. For once he possesses it he will be able to control the one who he owes a debt to. The ruler of the sea, Davy Jones. (Bill Nighy) But what would this quest be without the assistance of his fellow chum Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and his bride-to-be Elizabeth Swann? (Keira Knightly) They too are inevitably drug into this whirlwind of non-stop ""comedy"" and various mishaps. All the while is Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) also yearning to get the chest as well so he can single-handedly rid the seas of pirates everywhere.<br/><br/>Usually sequels don't surpass the greatness and originality their predecessors establish. 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' doesn't fail to follow suit. From the trailers it appears to be an exciting thrill ride loaded with tons of merriment. But in reality it's a two hour and thirty five minute foreseeable film filled with humdrum antics and sleep inducing banter.<br/><br/>The first 'Pirates' was absolutely one hundred percent far more delightful. Before it, a character with humor and essence such as Captain Jack Sparrow hadn't been seen in cinema. A once amusing and engaging Jack is now just plain annoying. Here in 'Dead Man's Chest' his foolhardy, joker demeanor only halts the story as it attempts to progress. In addition, average acting and direction are dishearteningly unveiled. The only pleasing aspects presented are the outstanding visuals and devilishly good villain Davy Jones. I'm afraid neither of these ingredients are able to save this mess of a film from sinking though.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, 'Dead Man's Chest' is nothing more than a film built on hype and in the end has no real substance. ""I think the second movie is strong and clever and has a lot going on"", said director Gore Verbinski in an October interview last year when speaking about 'Pirates'. Apparently this version of the film didn't make the final cut. Even so, 'Dead Man's Chest' will without a doubt continue to dominate at the movies and make other summer releases walk the plank at the box office. I don't think even Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx's big screen adaptation of 'Miami Vice' will be able to decimate it when released this Friday. I guess I can give Verbinski some credit though. It's pretty amazing to see a film with video-game logic that's created from zip do so tremendous."
"bill-1012","8","1","2","22 July 2006"," More human darkness than the first
","The plot and action and editing and all of that are everything you would ever want from a summer film. Ever. No need to detail those bits.<br/><br/>The characterization in this film approaches 3 dimensions more than Black Pearl. There is real betrayal here, the kind that requires real forgiveness if the next film is going to be worth the wait and samolians. A few of the characters fall into weakness in a way that makes them engaging, rather than fun. You can sympathize and identify with the ragged emotional state you find the crew at the end of the film.<br/><br/>But the film does not bog down on these points. The timing of real, elaborate and truly funny physical humor is world class. I don't think that summer film, the kind that lightens your load and engages as well, gets any better.<br/><br/>Go see it. Twice. But think twice about bringing kids under 9 or 10. There is some violence, and not all of it is physical. The bad guys, while entertaining, are bad. If you had them for neighbors, a neighborhood watch program would need artillery reinforcement."

For me, he didn't, in fact he was spot on for all his scenes, which happened to be very pacey, moving onto the next chapter after chapter, very quickly.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest is very Empire Strikes Back in its motive, effect on the viewer and trilogy.<br/><br/>The photography is fantastic, sometimes I felt they laid it on a little too much with the CGI but they got some interesting views and left scenes with great settings.<br/><br/>Liked how the story tied all the old crew -- bad guys and good guys --working together, to beat the Davey Jones gang. I also though it was a nice tip, to involve Elisabeth Swann into more of the action, this film basically made her a kick ass tom-boy-come-heroine, so to speak.<br/><br/>Nearly everyone from the first film, is in this one. It is quite cool in that respect, the minor parts were given bigger chances to shine, even the dog with the keys.<br/><br/>However, no one else really stands up to Jack Sparrow's effortlessly great persona and individuality.<br/><br/>I'm diggin'.<br/><br/>~Paul Browne."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","1","2","14 July 2006"," Just keeps getting better and better every time I watch it...
","Okay, so on first viewing...you can see some of the film's flaws: it's a tad overlong, there's such an abundance of stuff happening on screen, you may well get a headache/sore eyes afterwards (like I did), and there is some unnecessary dialogue/some jokes fall a bit flat. These are only minor quibbles, of course.<br/><br/>I'll admit that I'm probably one of the few who wasn't blown away by the first POTC film like everybody else seemed to be. While I thought it was quite good, I didn't think it reached the level of greatness that everyone else seemed to believe it did. Dead Man's Chest, essentially, offers more of the same - only it's amped up to a whole new level. But that's not necessarily a bad thing - if done right. This film hardly ever lets up. There's *always* something going on to hold your interest (the only parts I found slow/boring mostly involving Will Turner and his father, Bootstrap Bill). Everything else, though, demands your attention. <br/><br/>After seeing this film the first time, I thought it was another example of quantity over quality. It seemed to me the writers simply took what worked in the first film, then just thought ""More, more, MORE!"". Admittedly, this movie doesn't go for subtlety. However, after repeated viewings (and seeing the disappointing third film), I have a new appreciation for this middle instalment. For one thing, the film looks amazing (you gotta love that first killer shot we see of rain falling on teacups, followed by a mournful looking Elizabeth).<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, as Captain Jack Sparrow, makes an entrance in this movie that's just as memorable as his entrance in the first film. Any scene he's in is automatically made better by having him in it. Depp owns this role, and you can't help but love him in it. He's carved out a classic movie character that will forever be remembered. His interaction with the different characters in this movie - Will, Davy Jones, Elizabeth (*especially* Elizabeth) really let you see different sides to him. <br/><br/>I was extremely pleased to see that Keira Knightley's Elizabeth Swann got a chance to shine in this movie. Not only did Knightley get a chance to show off her comedic side (she made me laugh on more than one occasion), as well as her dramatic side, but she also proved to be pretty handy (and believable) when handling a sword. The way she plays off Depp's Sparrow makes for lots of great scenes between the two (the ending in particular). She definitely overshadowed her fiancée, Will Turner. While Orlando Bloom took part in two of movie's most memorable scenes, and also got to show he could do comedy really well, I felt his dramatic scenes with his father were a bit hollow. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, meanwhile, was a great new character/a very intriguing villain to both watch and listen to (his voice is so memorable). Every time he was on screen, you couldn't help but watch that tentacled beard of his. Nighy manages to make his villain very different to Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush in the first movie), but equally as interesting. And speaking of new interesting characters, I thought Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris) was a very engaging character. Although she was essentially in the movie to provide exposition, she managed to make it not be *boring* to listen to, which I appreciated. <br/><br/>Characters returning from the first movie include a very different kind of Norrington (a lot more scruffier/dirtier this time round), with Jack Davenport getting to explore more depth to his character, newly-mortal Pintel and Ragetti (who are more of an annoyance than entertainment, in my opinion), Gibbs (who got an increased role) and Elizabeth's father (who was reduced to only a couple of scenes). I'm happy to say that the CGI for both the Kraken and Davy Jones is top-notch. No dodgy CGI here. The part of the film where Jack Sparrow confronts the Kraken is - in a word - EPIC. It's a visual that will stay with you. As is the three-person sword fight (that eventually leads to dueling on a big wheel). Elizabeth trading swords with Pintel and Ragetti back and forth, as they fight Jones's seamen (don't go there), is great as well. She gets to be a competent fighter in this film (though, I did love that one instance where she let out the most girlish scream ever while being chased). It's such a visual feast for the eyes, mine were red by the end. I should also mention the music used in this film is awesome. It's so very fitting, and just makes every scene that much better (especially the use of organ when the Kraken attacks). The rollicking POTC theme is one that definitely gets you in the right mood for the film, and Davy Jones's 'theme' is equally good.<br/><br/>My only wish is that they had made it so we could think the story ended *here*, if we wanted to, in this movie (rather than being forced to watch the much more inferior third film for the wrap-up to the story). Unfortunately, given the cliff-hanger ending to this one, it requires you watch the third one if you want any sort of closure. I'll freely admit I was a little too harsh with this film when I first saw/reviewed it, but now I find it to be the most entertaining of the three POTC films. It's just so much FUN. Try not to focus on the flaws/take it too seriously, just sit back and enjoy the ride. It's certainly got plenty of swash and buckle."

","I was introduced (dragged rather) into Pirates when the first film came out. I NEVER expected to like the film, and from a distance, it was not a film I would have ever gone to see on my own. What I wonderful surprise it was that the first Pirates film was so fantastic! The whole story for Curse of the Black Pearl was excellent. It had a clear beginning, middle, and end. Also, potentially ambiguous areas in the story were quickly and identified and cleared up (I.E. Jack's prior involvement with Barbossa, the whole bit about the gold and the curse, Will and Elizabeth's background and friendship, and so on). This level of attention to detail made the rather long film entertaining and enjoyable for the full 2 ½ hours. Even the open-ended nature of the conclusion of POTC 1 left viewers wanting more. <br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest however, fell VERY short in many ways. I have probably seen the first film 100 times, and I watched it before I went to see POTC 2. Thank goodness I did or I would have been totally lost! Frankly, a viewer of Dead Man's Chest would NEED to watch the first film in order to ""get"" all the repetitive jokes in POTC 2 since they all refer to events that occurred in Curse of the Black Pearl. Not only is the first 20 minutes of Dead Man's Chest a massive ball of confusion, but also after the first 20-30 minutes you want to say, ""wait a minute, could you rewind that?"" <br/><br/>There is no clear clarification on the actual involvement/purpose of the new Lord Beckett. There is no explanation about Captain Jack and the disbanded members of the old (but familiar) crew. The sudden introduction of a Voodoo woman (Tia Dalma) speaks with such a thick accent that her words are barely discernible. Commodore Norrington's role is very different, and although Jack Davenport's acting is superb in POTC 2, we really don't know what happened to him or how he ended up where he did. Even the entire plot surrounding Captain Jack, Bootstrap Bill, and Davy Jones is blurred by spotty explanations and additional elements that just add to the confusion. <br/><br/>One would think that with everything going on in POTC 2 that Elizabeth and Will would be fully included. It was disappointing to find that Elizabeth's character is flighty and exhibits little structure, and other than a few sword fights, Will is lost in the crowd. A very positive aspect of the film is that Captain Jack Sparrow is just as wonderful and swaggering as ever. However, witty and clever elements in the first Pirates flick become cheesy and cliché in Dead Man's Chest, which left this viewer thinking that the director ran out of ideas or was rushed. <br/><br/>The ending of Dead Man's Chest was captivating enough to make viewers ""want"" to know what happens next, but everything that happened prior to the ending was choppy at best with little more than spectacular graphics to hold the film together."
"Jay_Exiomo","5","1","2","12 July 2006"," Ship's in for a draining trip
","Disney struck gold three years ago when they first released ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" which ended a long slump for films about pirates. So it's only a matter of time before sequels followed. And because the ship ain't broke, no major fixing was done. Everything from the first film was there: from the amusing one-liners to the excellent special effects here and there. And yes, Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are all in a second go for a ride, including director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, and screenwriters Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio. In short, everything that made ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" a work of entertaining summer fun was there. Except for some.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) and Will Turner (Bloom) are about to be married, but no sooner than the movie had begun when they are arrested and condemned to death by Lord Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company for helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp). But Beckett offers a reprieve for Turner if he can give him Jack's compass (a compass that points to one's true desire).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Captain Jack is warned by ""Bootstrap Bill"" Turner (Stellan Skarsgård) - Will's father - that Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) is set to settle a debt Jack owes the ruler of the sea and captain of the Flying Dutchman. Jack must find a way to pay his debt to avoid serving Davy Jones for a long time. So we have Will after Jack's compass, Jack after Davy Jones' heart hidden in a chest buried somewhere (hence the movie's title), Elizabeth after Will, Bootstrap Bill after the safety of his son, and former Commodore Norrington (Jack Davenport) after Jack to reclaim his lost honor.<br/><br/>Therein lies the movie's problem: it didn't quite work the second time around (for me at least, because as we all know, this film shattered a lot of box-office records in its first weekend run). The first one was thrilling, funny, and entertaining, albeit in a Jerry Bruckheimer-flick kind of way, which is turning your brains off. The sequel is still exciting, humorous, and entertaining. But unlike the first installment, ""Dead Man's Chest"" lacks focus. The overstuffed storyline might have seemed reasonable in pitching the story before it's green-lit but it comes across as similarly confusing and confused. Verbinski isn't exactly a household name in terms of big movies, but his work in the first film (and in ""The Ring"" to some extent) clearly shows he has a knack for escapist film-making by crafting the picture in a simplistic but enthralling enough manner that didn't hinder the characters, the action, or the adventure. It also seems that the scriptwriters tried to take everything in the first film and bloat it exponentially.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes seemed a little otiose and without neither reason nor rhyme, which stripped it off of a sense of urgency that made the first film thrilling in the first place. And granted that the special effects were of visual caliber my academic daydreams are made of, it feels like virtually every aspect of the original is rehashed and then geometrically pumping up every detail into something bigger. I'm actually a fan of the first film (not a big fan, but a fan nonetheless) but ""Dead Man's Chest"" is just turgid in every sense of it. Only the still likable cast (Depp made a lot of college girls in the audience swoon) and the prevailing fact that Verbinski proves to be more effective at delivering pure popcorn flicks recently than the likes of Michael Bay and Rob Cohen keep this film barely afloat.<br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest"" film has all the things that made ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" work, and yet the paradox of it all is that while it's crammed, it feels lacking in the end. Partly, of course, due to the blatant come-on for the third ""Pirates"". Still, this second ride's more exhausting than thrilling."
"Magadan","7","1","2","12 July 2006"," A dark and frolicking sequel
","It's obvious from the first rain-soaked opening shots of Dead Mans Chest that this film has a darker nature than the often merry ""Curse of the Black Pearl"". (If you consider rotting, undead corpses on a ghost ship merry, that is.) What's less obvious is this movies beating heart, which lies at both the literal and figurative center of the story. <br/><br/>Old characters are back, and although some reviewers accuse them of being well, out of character, I didn't notice a great change. Will is still noble, slightly bumbling, deadly-with-a-sword-ready-to die-for-love-and-honor-Turner. Jack is still a drunken scoundrel with a decent streak that often lands him in trouble, and Elizabeth is still torn between being proper and being Elizabeth. If the character have seemed to have lost something, it was probably innocence. And quite frankly,who can blame them after everything they had seen? <br/><br/>There is a plot, of sorts. Granted, it won't win a guild award, but it doesn't have to. Like a dime store romance (or a great swashbuckler) the plot(having something to do with an angry squid named Davey and a magical compass)only has to serve as a means of getting our hero(s) into one pickle after another. But it does more than that, giving us more history about the first movie (origin of the Black Pearl, The nature of Jack's broken compass)and moments that surpass the first in impact ( watching Jack come face to face with the Kraken is worth the price of admission) All in all, if your looking for the next ""Citizen Kane"" (or another ""Curse of the Black Pearl) you'll be disappointed. But if your looking for a swashbuckling, arse-kicking sequel, you'll enjoy it from beginning to end."
"mfsor","6","1","2","11 July 2006"," Good graphics, often exciting, often boring
","Okay, I'll go up to six because of the terrific graphics. But it ended up as a big octopus pummeling boats, and that's not good film-making. Sure, Depp was great, the natives-eat-the-chief sequence was funny, and Bill Nighy as Davy was fabulous. But too often, nothing really was happening, and it certainly was hard to get into Bloom's relationship with Barnacle Bill (although that was a good character). Long periods went on without anything really interesting happening, and that's what kept it from being a really good movie (despite the grand numbers of people who went to see it). The bad English lord, or whatever he was, conflicted with the master of the briny deep, and that kept it confusing. The attention to detail everywhere was outstanding, I will admit to that. Up to 7. Not, because there was still too much boredom for long stretches."

","Once again I found myself outside the cinema as is tradition for a number of my birthdays (and most Friday nights I might add). This years choice was one I'm sure, hundreds of fans decided upon to part with a small fund to get the experience of the Pirates story that has already exceeded expectations in a legendary manor with the first instalment. The film was magnificent! It catered for ever possible need. It consisted of side-splitting comedy to mild horror, with the promise of a consistent storyline that remained true to the first film and the consistency of the first film. Although at some stages the film's plat became hidden somewhat, you were promised particularly with the last hours darkening sped up pace, a darkening storyline with a sudden and VERY unexpected climax at the end. The characters were as stunning as ever of course. Jack Sparrow played by Johnny Depp held your attention with his outstanding acting skills, and pleasing manor and looks (as I know from myself and friends that he was particularly sweet on their eyes). While of course being as funny as ever before if not better. He is the primary foundation of the film I conclude holding it spectacularily together. Of course there is still Elizabeth and Will. Will still a very good performance by Orlando Bloom if not tremendously outshined by Johnny Depp and the gorgeous and skillful Elizabeth Swann played by Keira Knightly. The film not only had great acting but it had fantastic stunts. What a star studded fearless stunt team, and the commitment made by the actors too was astounding. I find it exceptionally important that I mention the new characters-(Bootstrap) Bill Turner played by an actor with such a commanding presence and voice, and of course the Legendary Davy Jones of the Seven Seas, played to perfection with an astounding power on screen. I can't wait for the next film, particularly because of the new approach to the characters in this sequel. Every character was seen to show their own agendas very subtly and beneath the normal exteriors of the characters the actors managed to portray the complexity of feelings and conflicts going on beneath the surface of not one, but all the characters. I particularly loved the scenes with Elizabeth and Jack, because of the true conflict with in Jack to either stick to his double-crossing, past caring ways or succumb to the nagging good honest side within him; and the conflict Elizabeth begins to strongly feel, as fate (inspired by cracks in the her relationship with Will increasingly forming)begins to push her and Jack together in a way that I for one could never have expected. After all she had loved pirates as a child, maybe, just maybe her heart lies in the future, not in a ruled marriage with kind sweet Will, but a swashbuckling adventure with a pirate with an underlying honesty and love of freedom...(I wonder who that could be..think really hard)..."

","Captain Jack Sparrow sets sail again, this time with the notorious Davey Jones looming over his head, leaving the usually imperturbable Captain Jack fleeing for his soul.<br/><br/>The Curse of the Black Pearl was an anomaly that set the bar to a height that may well be unattainable. How often does one find a movie that has so much going against it, and it still remains a success. Originally, when executives discussed the plan of making a movie based on the beloved theme-park attraction, they conceived a made-for-video movie that would attempt to make a low-budget story out of a ride without a clear story.<br/><br/>The first film worked because they didn't try to make sense of the ride (which as much as I love it, the story of the ride would make a very dull pirate movie) Rather they tried to create a swashbuckling pirate movie that would rejuvenate the franchise for generations to come, and with the amazing talent of Johnny Depp in their corner, create one of the most memorable characters to ever hit the silver screen.<br/><br/>The first movie could stand alone as a complete story, without need for further delving into the legends of Captain Jack, but where would be the fun (and profit) of that? Dead Man's Chest suffers from the trilogy syndrome, much in the same way that Back to the Future and Lord of the Rings suffered: The second movie will inevitably remain the weakest of the three, and during it's initial release, will become the whipping-boy for the franchise. Because the public is mostly aware that the third movie is in the works, the story is created as a bridge between the first and second movie, and will always result in a cliff-hanger of sorts. Those who are unaware of the impending third movie will scorn the directors for leaving it so open at the end, and the more informed viewers will overlook the film to keep their eye focused on the conclusion of the story.<br/><br/>Sadly, the studio themselves seemingly do the same thing. Production values on Dead Man's Chest were not as high as they were for the Curse of the Black Pearl, and it's likely that the studio is more focused on part 3, making part 2 more of a necessary evil rather than an important piece of the puzzle.<br/><br/>That notwithstanding, the movie itself is fun. The action sequences are exciting, the jokes (although not as witty and original as they were in the first) are great, and Captain Jack is just as lovable a rogue as ever. The blending of CGI in this film compared to the first is not as smooth, and there are some design issues for several of the creatures that ILM created this time around.<br/><br/>Walt Disney hated sequels, and when asked why he wouldn't do a sequel to the Three Little Pigs, he simply stated that ""you can't top pigs with pigs."" In this case, you can't do it with Pirates either.<br/><br/>Overall, it's still a fun and exciting movie, and it leads into what promises to be an equally fun and exciting third installment. As long as you don't expect it to surpass the first film, you should enjoy this adventure with Captain Jack"
"jinx237","6","1","2","10 July 2006"," 1 _ 3
","The first Pirates movie, unlike Dead Man's Chest, was a complete story. The movie's producers, directors, and actors had to make a film that would stand on its own, as there was no guarantee that it would be as wildly successful as it was. But once that first movie, Curse of the Black Pearl, became so well-loved, Disney immediately shifted its focus from creating a great sequel to managing a great franchise. Thus we have a Dead Man's Chest which extends, rather than advances, the story. It is filled with the high-quality graphics, fun characters, and self-effacing humor that we loved about the first, but can hardly be called a ""movie"" in its own right. What actually happened over the course of 2 hours could have been 20 minutes of set-up at the beginning of the real sequel, which will be the final piece of the trilogy: At World's End.<br/><br/>The bottom line is that Pirates 1 was a great movie, just as Pirates 3 will be. Pirates 2 is only there to milk the proverbial cash cow, and because trilogies seem to be in vogue of late. It adds little value to the franchise."
"kdsnail","5","1","2","10 July 2006"," Not as good as the first
","While everyone WANTS this movie to be good, it just does not appeal to the audience as much as the first one did. I thought perhaps there were different writers, but they are the same.<br/><br/>The movie relies more on special effects, which are well done, than actor exposure. Johnny Depp is not the central character this time and shares equal screen time with Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightly. The film is slow, dreary, and drags at times. The comedic lines looked hammed up at times, desperately trying to pull a laugh from the audience when there really is none. At other times, the editor clips away from the moment much too soon for your brain to register that a line or action might have been funny.<br/><br/>The character, Captain Jack Sparrow, was the center of entertainment in the first film with others interacting in HIS story. In the second movie, he seems to be dragged in to fulfill some contract and not interested in being on screen much at all.<br/><br/>One can only hope the third movie thinks about what the audience is hoping to see, and provide it!"
"dick_knickson","4","1","2","10 July 2006"," It's the Search for Spock
","Hollywood is always willing to pay tens of millions of dollars to get big-name stars and for special effects, but that money would be better spent hiring writers. This movie had great effects, but the storyline seemed to revolve around, ""How can we jam in as many characters from the first movie and CGI effects as possible?"" The only character I cared about was William's father. The rest could have been eaten by the cracker for all I care. It is also way too long. I found myself checking my watch, trying to figure when they will wrap it up. They don't. It is all just a big setup for the 3rd movie.

","The first Pirates movie ranked as one of my favorite films of all time. It was exciting, and the characters were charming and entertaining, and strangely believable. Sadly, now that Pirates has become a sensation, the plot of the second film shriveled to nothing more than fluff. The action isn't even particularly compelling, and the characters actions are not believable. In a good story, we are always willing to suspend our disbelief in the impossible and become engrossed in the lives of the characters. This never happens in Dead Man. In fact, at many points during the film, I was focused on thoughts such as ""oh, look, now the actors had to do this"". It was very much a parade of effects and glorified fight scenes and chases. Stereotypical. Predictable. Boring. Disappointing. I still give it a 5/10 because I loved Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. But I'm angry that they didn't measure up to a standard that I think should have been possible. I'm sure the merchandising will be very successful... and of course, that's what it's really all about, isn't it?"

","As you can see my rating for this movie was a 4. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen (see white chicks for that) but at the same time I did leave the theater very upset. I can appreaciate that this movie is part of a larger story. I loved the matrix trilogy and it employed the same release path. But the major difference between the matrix trifecta and pirates is that of marketing. Everyone (read: who cared) knew that when they went and saw Reloaded in May of 2003 that they should not have expected the story to come to any kind of conclusion. It was well known that there was a third movie coming out 6 months later and that it would pick up right where it left off. However with this movie (possible spoiler i suppose) that was not the case. When ______ (that guy) came walking down the steps at the end, I fully expected the movie to march on. In fact I was pleased that the movie stopped putting it off, then that very thing happened. Right when the story (or at least one of them, there were too many to count) was about to come to resolution the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Now to be fair I have no problem with a clifhanger. Its going to a movie expection to see some story, with an ending, and instead I get a gigantic clifhanger. FOR A MOVIE THAT Isn't OUT FOR ANOTHER 10 MONTHS! With that rant about the ending (lack of one) over; the movie was still visually appealing, and rather entertaining. Granted it was dull at points, and the dialogue was hard to understand, it was still overall good; if you can deal with watching a 2.5 hour trailer for the next movie.<br/><br/>Summery: No ending, heavy accents, slow at times, great cgi, Capt Jack Rocks.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Read a few spoilers, save 8$, see the third one its only 250+ days away."
"koohoolin","Null","1","2","9 July 2006"," CGI smothers plot
","1) I got the very strong impression that Disney was more intent on promoting new additions to the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" theme park ride, rather than articulate an adventure to us. How many more scenes of huge structures containing people, rolling through the jungle, can one endure in a single movie? I say again, ""huge structures CONTAINING PEOPLE, rolling through the jungle""(get ready to ROLL, Disney theme park fans!) The one involving the water wheel was a bit too long, especially following the rolling CAGE in which the pirates had been held captive. One gag depicting a large object, rolling through the jungle, filled with disoriented characters (still not getting it?) per movie is quite enough, please. 2) This is a classic example of CGI effects overwhelming story. There were way too many distracting, living sea creatures, popping out of the bodies of characters who surrounded a speaking actor, for me to keep up with the unfolding story. Many times, an actor would deliver his/her lines in desperation as antennae, eels, tentacles, etc., waved about his or her face, in the background, as well as the foreground. This was fascinating, but distracting. On further reflection, I had the identical feeling of confusion experienced after viewing ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" (I was tempted to go see the Riddick turkey again, in the hopes of clearing up the confusion). Sorry, some may find this comparison insulting, but the problem of CGI domination held sway in both of these movies. The single responsive word in my mind as I left both flicks was, ""Wha...?"". 3) As for the voodoo woman in the swamp...what the he** was she saying? Her accent was too thick; authentic, possibly, but too thick, and delivered in a tone which was too soft. What might be more important here? Authentic accent, or successful communication? I simply caught little of what she said, except the part about the jar of dirt, a very weak gag that was just a flash in the pan. 4) Ditto for the squiddy Davey Jones character...just what the he** was HE saying? Under all those fleshy, invertebrate protuberances, his lines were almost impossible to discern. 5) Just as Johnny Depp's character rose out of his throne to address the issue of a larger fire, watch as he seems to suddenly remember to employ the Keith Richards characterization of his body movements. Watch in particular his hastily extended right arm, just as he rises from the throne. It was as if, ""Oops! I almost forgot to move about like Keith Richards! This production is killing me, and another is yet to be wrapped!"" He seemed to jerk himself into character. I think that during shooting, Johnny had been enjoying his rest upon that movie prop, and suddenly, the director shouted, ""Roll 'em!"", or, ""we're not paying you all that money to sleep on the job, Depp!"", totally taking him by surprise(don't get me wrong...I'm a Depper, myself...) I made a point to carefully observe the audience, once this overly-long movie had ended. By the looks on their faces, they were as confused as I was, and in quite a lot of pain as they rose stiffly from the chair they had been seated in for well over two hours. Also, the reintroduction of Captain Barbossa at the very end seemed to be a slap in the face (What's this? You add yet ANOTHER twist to this already convoluted plot?) POTC seemed to be in competition with the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy at this point, an effort to one up THAT most excellent trilogy. It should have been acknowledged, however, that the LOTR trilogy has been thoroughly time-tested. ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" now seems to be running a marathon (weighed down by carelessly applied CGI, as well as a patchwork plot), in direct competition with LOTR, a strange ""keeping up with the Joneses"" phenomena in movie-making(""We gotta have OUR trilogy too, Frodo!"") This time, my ticket had been free. I will likely return, though, paying for a ticket this time around, hopefully in order to clear up some of the confusion. I will try to listen far more intently to ""voodoo-woman"" and ""squid-man"", endeavouring to filter out more of the waving sea-fauna/flora which fought for my attention. Maybe this is just another case of ""organized confusion"" to persuade me to purchase a ticket. You got me, Disney. I'm there."

","So who saw the Dead Mans Chest? I did, on opening day, the most packed theater I've ever seen cause naturally i have to go to the snooty one in the city. But anyway. I was a little disappointed, it was no where near as classic (IMO) as the original. It lacked the Jack/ Will scenes that i think made the movie. Jack Sparrow was charismatic as always, but why they felt the need to all of a sudden have him chasing after Elizabeth is beyond me. The *SPOILERS* scene where they kiss had some people in the theater cheering, but me? No, i was too busy shaking my head in disappointment to cheer. It was just unnecessary to me. The use of recycled jokes annoyed me also. Yes the ""why is the rum gone"" joke was a hoot in the first one, but it being over used in the second one (""why is the rum always gone"" and ""hide the rum"") said nothing about the writers abilities to keep it fresh. Don't even get me started on the women in Tortuga joke...that bummed me out. Another crucial mistake they made was the villain with NO charisma, you couldn't possibly like Davey Jones like you did with Barbossa. And to be honest, the best part of the movie was *SPOILERS* when he turned up at the end. The movie really suffered without him IMO. Now, i love me some Pirates of the Caribbean, but this movie is just proof of how desperate movie makers are to just make some money that they don't even care if they make a completely stale-to-begin-with sequel. To Mr Depp = I love you, but for heavens sake, did you READ the script before agreeing to it? I suggest you do so in the future."

","I wanted to love this film. I did. The three previous movies of Gore Verbinski's (The Ring, Pirates 1 and The Weatherman) I cherished. They showed a rising director who had talent. This film is nothing like those movies or for that matter, even ""Curse of the Black Pearl.""<br/><br/>While watching the film, I got the sense that I was in a test screening to see what works and what isn't. Then the realisation that I wasn't in a test screening, I was in an opening weekend viewing sunk in. It was a realisation i wish I would not have had, because I was desperately wanting to fill out the card and voice my opinion.<br/><br/>My main problem with this film is that they didn't try hard at all. The only thing it felt like they tried at was to re-establish how good the first movie actually was. I'm guessing that like me, most people loved the comic lines from the first film. Unlike the first film though, they don't subtly throw them out anymore. The comic lines in this film aren't thrown out to the audience; they gave us the equivalent of putting us in a batting range and hit all the ball to us at speed's so fast that the laughs aren't even over with before they expect us to laugh again. The laughing may cause to miss key points.<br/><br/>The acting was another disappointment from this film. Don't expect another nomination for Johnny this time. Yes, I am saying that Johnny Depp even was unbearable in this movie. It's not that he was bad in this movie per se, it's just he attempted to completely copy everything that made his performance in the first one so great. Exclude the character development from the first movie and he's still the same antagonist; even this time he's not likable, in fact, one could possibly say he is the most unlikable thing about the whole movie. Even Stellan Skaarsgard was understated in this film and I think he's an amazing actor. Looking back on this film, the only character I did like was Kiera Knightley's who this time around wasn't just reserved for eye candy but actually had things to do.<br/><br/>One of the things I did like was Gore Verbinski's amazing cinematograghy. Except the problem with his cinematography was that he uses amazing shots in the middle of an action that takes you out of the movie and has nothing to do with what's going on.

","We can all be so easily influenced by ""word of mouth"", and by those we deem authorities in such matters, the ones we so affectionately call ""the critics."" I strongly suggest that before you listen to the warnings of others, especially if you liked the first PIRATES, then ante up for the second, and enjoy the ride to the end, which will have you beggin' for more.<br/><br/>The critics said it was too long, but it's only a few minutes longer than the first, and those critics who cried for editing to chop the movie down to size should be asking themselves WHAT to cut, because a good movie gives you time to breathe, as it were (apologies to Davey). The movie had a lot of information to give you and if you're paying attention, you'll get the clues which take you to the end of PIRATES 2 and beyond.<br/><br/>Second, the critics said the movie was disjointed, and the storyline fragmented. I say let what comes up from underneath... have at 'em! There is one major plot, which is clearly laid out at the beginning, runs through the movie and stands up near the end, while several subplots dance around the main plot, as it where(again apologies to Davey).<br/><br/>I liked the fact, without giving away the main plot, that the creators have upped the ante for PIRATES 2, and ... (careful now...must not give it all away)...well let's just day there are a few surprises and unanswered questions, which I'm sure ...will answer. Some old characters brought back, and some new ones, notably a charmer in those dark waters, which can only be visited at night.<br/><br/>Depp did seem to lack the energy of PIRATES 1, but only for about half the movie. He comes on very strong towards the end, and there is a wonderful scene with Lizzy (KK) aboard ""THE PEARL"", which livens one of the subplots. I can hear the critics now saying, ""If only that would have come earlier."" BUT IT COULDN'T!!! <br/><br/>Tantalizing special effects brought farce and fun together, and let's not forget the end of PIRATES 2. Did I mention...<br/><br/>I can't wait for PIRATES 3, and I do hope the writers won't scurry to undo what they've purpatrated in this movie. You may be aware that they're at least half way to completion of PIRATES 3. <br/><br/>YO HO me hearties."
"surreyhill","7","1","2","8 July 2006"," PASTICHE of the Caribbean--SPOILER
","This movie throws everything but the galley sink at the wall and only some of it sticks We have the ship named Flying Dutchman, but not the actual Flying Dutchman, which irritated the heck out of me because he'd have been a lot more interesting given the lovelorn theme than Davy Jones. We have mythological beasts, legendary seamen, and voodoo priestesses with hard-ons for Johnny Depp.<br/><br/>Well, I suppose the last bit isn't quite so unrealistic.<br/><br/>But she dug Orlando Bloom on sight, and I don't get that at all.<br/><br/>Anyhow, there are some huge problems with this movie, and not all of them could be resolved by tying the plot points up neatly at the end of the third movie. First, we have too many derivative echoes of Star Wars. I've read as much Joseph Campbell as the next nerd, but it gets tedious seeing the same romantic triangles played out over and over, and the same dynamic between the cursed and hideously-deformed villain who was turned to evil because he was unsuccessful in romance set against a young and pure-hearted protagonist.<br/><br/>I swear to high heaven, if Will and Elizabeth turn out to be brother and sister in Pirates III, I will flipping throw my large Diet Pepsi--ice, straw, soda, and all--at the screen. That will most seriously displease me.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my second complaint, namely--watching Keira Knightly vacillate between Will and Jack is rendered absurd by the existence of what a lamer Orlando Bloom is in one of three key heroic (?) roles. OK, OK...put the man in platform shoes, give him blond hair extensions and blue contacts, and he's otherworldly beautiful. But he. Can't. Act. His way out of a paper bag, let alone off a ship full of cursed sailors who look like walking, talking, barnacle-encrusted bits of flotsam and jetsam. He's just not got the juice, and you put him next to Depp on screen and it's clear that any reasonably piratical lass would opt for a dirty weekend and a trip around the bay with Captain Jack as opposed to a lifetime of boredom with nice-guy Will.<br/><br/>But wait, there are glimmers of hope. Our plucky, lightsabre (I mean sword!)-wielding heroine turns out to have a rather machiavellian side to her, before plunging into regret for her actions. Will showed promising signs of jealousy and violence, before reverting to Luke Skywalker-esquire mastery of his anger. And Captain Sparrow seems to me to be ripe for the picking in whatever passes for a piratical version of a male midlife crisis, though Mr. Rochester-like, he's bound to be permanently maimed, first, before he's rendered fit for a lifetime of being press-ganged by anything in petticoats. The best dynamic in this movie wasn't (sadly) between the nominal villains and the heroes, it was between two of the heroes; Jack tells Elizabeth she will be tempted to try being truly self-serving because she is curious and will want to know what it feels like, and Elizabeth very pertly (because we're talking Keira here whose jaw is the only thing more aggressive and jutting than the toothily-armed prow of the Flying Dutchman in this movie) tells him that he will in turn wish to sample the joys of being a decent fellow doing the right thing, and enjoying the respect and admiration which comes from being a good guy and hero.<br/><br/>I could almost hear Han and Leia bantering, or Rick from Casablanca saying ""I stick my neck out for no one"".<br/><br/>Long live the antihero, and may he always get the girl, or at least stride off into the sunset with Claude Raines.<br/><br/>OK, here's what you really need to know. The pacing is not good in this installment. There are parts which are just too loud and go on too long. The waterwheel sword fight, however, is all it's cracked up to be, and then some. The script neglects to give its most charming characters any memorable lines. Davy Jones is well-voiced, and beautifully (which is to say disgustingly) CGI-rendered, as is the Krakken. I thought I'd crave sushi after this film, but found I did not. I was pleased as punch to see Jack Davenport's Commander Norrington character return, mostly because I had girlfriends who dug him in the first movie. He has a heckuva voice, and looks better with a tan and some dirt all over him.<br/><br/>And there will always be an England so long as there are superb British Character actors like Tom Hollander to add an elegant and silky menace to cardboard villain roles, and McKenzie Crooks to be alternately Gareth from The Office (BBC) and the austensible (sic) comic relief other than Johnny Depp in this one. And.............<br/><br/>SPOILERS I'm thinking the real beating heart of the Davy Jones character is that music box. They didn't try to turn him into the Phantom of the Opera for nothing, IMO.<br/><br/>Just please, please, PLEASE do not let his long-lost love be the unintelligible voodoo priestess. I not only have a large diet soda to hurl, but also popcorn.<br/><br/>Jerry Bruckheimer, you HAVE been warned.<br/><br/>And I don't appreciate you left the dog on that island to be eaten."
"Tacchimonster","6","1","2","8 July 2006"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Taking on Water
","When ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" first came out in theaters back in 2003 it surprised moviegoers who were expecting a campy, but child-friendly movie about pirates and ghosts - the typical kind of thing that normally comes with the Disney brand name. Quite frankly, considering the film was easily identified with the famous theme park ride, who could blame those initially wrote it off? <br/><br/>However, the ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" went on to surprise audiences with its stunning visuals, intriguing story and the introduction of a character so captivating that he single-handedly revolutionized Johnny Depp's career by finally putting him into mainstream public's eye. Considering that makes for one stiff bill, it is easy to understand why ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" is such a disappointment.<br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest,"" which opened in theaters Friday, is the 150 minute follow up from where ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" left off. On the wedding day of William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) it is revealed that Will and Elizabeth are to be imprisoned and sentenced to death for their hand in helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) allude being captured at the end of ""Curse of the Black Pearl."" Will is given an opportunity, however, to avoid such a fate by hunting down Captain Sparrow and stealing his compass, which he can then exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Sparrow also finds himself in a bit of a pickle when he learns that a deal he made with the spirit of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) has expired and that Jones is coming to collect the agreed debt  Sparrow's soul. This all boils over with another misadventure at sea as Sparrow and company attempt to find a way to avoid an eternity of damnation and servitude to Jones and clear the names of Will and Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film's plot doesn't pan out as smoothly as its outline would make it seem. Despite having what seems to be an interesting plot, much of the intrigue and mystery that made the original ""Pirates"" so popular gets muddled over to make way for numerous action sequences that lack originality and, to be honest, are downright pointless considering the film's plot. Rather than sticking to the original film's guns, director Gore Verbinski chose to make ""Dead Man's Chest"" action heavy rather than trying to focus on telling a good story.<br/><br/>For instance, within the half-hour of the film viewers are whisked away to an entirely ridiculous visit to what can only be described as Cannibal Island, where Will, Sparrow and his crew must escape the man-eating natives. Not only was the entire scene unfunny, but also so childish and stupid that you actually begin to get the feeling that you're watching a kids movie and not a pirate movie that had an opening scene where crows peck out the eyes of prisoners.<br/><br/>Possibly even more depressing than the mishandled plot would be in watching a great character in Jack Sparrow get ruined by bad dialogue and confusing side-plots. Sure Depp has some memorable lines that have the zest that the first film was chalked with and he again steals the show with another incredible entrance, but those positives are quickly tarnished as you watch Depp's character head into a new direction. <br/><br/>Sparrow now seems more cowardly than dashing; choosing even to flee the Black Pearl while his crewmates fight off a sea monster. Ask yourself this: would the Sparrow from ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" have abandoned the ship he was so passionate about? Considering what he went through just to regain control of it, one could only conclude that the answer would be no.<br/><br/>Depp's character also suffers from contradictions made in the first film. Back in ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" Will and Elizabeth were willing to stand and die alongside Sparrow because they knew Sparrow was a ""good man."" However, throughout this current adventure an underlying theme between Elizabeth and Sparrow is that Elizabeth is convinced that Sparrow wants to know what its like to be a good person, which is why he is in capable of being completely bad. Now, that would have been an interesting side-plot had they not already concluded that he was a good person in the first film  leaving intelligent viewers wondering whether or not the original film's script was ever consulted before they went ahead and filmed ""Dead Man's Chest.""<br/><br/>Its unfortunate, but the newest film in the ""Pirates"" cannon falls short (and sometimes fails completely) in so many ways that it is undeserving of its title. Rather than having another terrific story supported by superb acting and stunning visuals, we're given a bunch of cheap thrills, confusing side-plots, a few zesty one-liners, only one real bright spot in what will be known as the ""giant wheel fight scene,"" and another annoying Hollywood cliffhanger ending that'll leave audiences with a bitter taste in their mouth  much like that of ""Matrix: Reloaded,"" which ironically has a plot that is eerily similar to ""Dead Man's Chest.""<br/><br/>Overall, people who can't look past their sentimental attachment to the first film will proclaim the sequel as a success. Unfortunately, the rest of us will know that isn't the case"
"rct8r4","8","1","2","8 July 2006"," It's what I thought it would be, and a little more
","Unless you are currently residing in a quaint little cave on the back half of Mars you've probably heard of Pirates of the Caribbean (pronounced ka-rib-ee-un): Dead Man's Chest. I'm gonna try not to drone on here, but I just wanted to say that I was not disappointed...(and I do not foresee any spoilers here, but I will warn you if something comes to mind)...<br/><br/>The sequel isn't nearly as tight as the original, but that was to be expected considering that this film was written in tandem with the third film (to be released Summer 2007). So, we must forgive any untied ends until after the final film. Although I do have to say, you may leave the theatre with an unsettled feeling as you think about the time which separates you and the conclusion to this story.<br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so had me wondering whether or not these two films were going to unmercifully crush even its most loyal fans a la Matrix. But the film begins to warm up halfway into the first act and steadily builds to a wonderfully adventurous/treacherous crescendo. I'm happy to report that my doubts have faded considerably. I think this is going to be a truly great trilogy.<br/><br/>The returning cast is as fun to watch as ever. Somehow, I still can't help waiting for Bloom to grab a bow and take down some !#$in Orcs, I'm not sure if it's his performance or my lack of imagination. Keira Knightley steps up her comedic timing a few notches; this really seemed to be a standout performance from her. Cap'n Jack Sparrow is allowed another fantastic screen entrance, enjoy it; Depp milks this character and still has a few more gallons to go it seems. We really get some good CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow moments and the film really seems to focus on him, which is right on target. Mackenzie Crook shows up and delivers some true comic relief. And there are a few other returning cast members who make memorable re-appearances. As for the new cast, Bill Nighy is wonderful as a 7/8 digital Davy Jones. Naomie Harris (28 Days Later) rocks the creepy little house her character lives in. Good stuff here.<br/><br/>So anyhoot, go see it, it's good."

"fire_sprite_pain","9","1","2","8 July 2006"," Well I liked it
","Well personally, a lot of people, mostly critics, have complained about the movie being too long. One of my biggest complaints in movies, and a lot of movies that are parts of a series (this being a 2-parter), is that they don't take their time to develop conflict and resolution. It's all just given to you like BAM and there you have it, it's a movie. This one took its time, gave all the characters meaning, every single one. That's a real rarity in movies, but because it didn't need to focus so much on its core cast, the writing allowed the movie to expand its cast. Suddenly the crew is doing more, is more interesting. Your villain is interesting. And the conflicts are all over the place to be resolved in the 3rd movie. I think the big complaint is just that it was long with a bunch of exposition to a bigger story, rather than just being itself. I think the critics and critical fans have to step back and say, ""Review this movie as if it were the first half"". You all sat through Return of the King, this was easy. But when the third movie comes out, then watch the second one and decide if it really was so bad or so hard to watch. All it did for me was go, ""Oh, I wanna see the next one!"""
"CageBerry","8","1","2","7 July 2006"," Lives up to my expectations.
","Let me start out by saying I love love love love LOVE the Curse of the Black Pearl, so this sequel was a bit frightening for me. As soon as I heard they were making it, I quickly assumed the worst would come of it. Then recently when I started seeing all the commercials and previews I thought ""well... it actually doesn't look half bad"". What an understatement! This is probably going to go down as what I consider one of the best sequels ever (I'll wait until the third installment before I make the call). In fact, on the way home from seeing it, I got in a chat with my friend about it possibly being the best trilogy ever, beating even Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I love both of those, but PotC just seems to have that rewatchability that I usually require.<br/><br/>The same friend said before we got there that he heard it was going to be a much more serious movie, to which I replied ""we'll see"". Thankfully, he was fairly wrong as they never failed to keep the laughs coming. They can take the most serious of situations like, oh I don't know.... a man about to become barbecue, and turn it into a hilarious bit of comedy.<br/><br/>In general, I think Dead Man's Chest is a much grander movie. Everything seems bigger and badder (as in Michael Jackson's ""Bad"", not bad like the Buffalo Bills' Super Bowl record) and wilder and funnier. The visual effects were pretty much mind-boggling. The costume/character design was amazing to the point of I would seriously be infuriated if they don't win every award for it. Everything is so superb as far as cinematography goes.<br/><br/>A smaller detail, if you needed convincing, this movie will no doubt prove to you that Keira Knightley is one of the sexiest people alive.<br/><br/>The rest you can probably assume. The plot was great and somehow worked out well, The acting was nothing horrible, etc etc etc.<br/><br/>You might be asking how I have all these great things to say about the movie, and still give it an 8. Two reasons. One, I reserve 10's for what I think are the absolute best movies (by my standards, which aren't normal), so this is starting at a 9. Two, it took a little while to get going. The first 30 or 40 minutes just had some seemingly desperate attempts to connect random things to things that happened in the first film.<br/><br/>If you only had time to read one sentence of this review, I hope it will be the next one. This movie was not only worth more than the $8.50 I paid to see it, but it was worth seeing it while sitting in front of five preteen girls with candy in plastic bags, and the gift of gab."
"orlandolover8904","9","1","2","7 July 2006"," Pirates 2=LOVE! *Spoilers--watch out!!*
","This movie had me going from beginning to end. Mostly because the movie was all action, and not much of a plot. But, despite that, I absolutely LOVED THE MOVIE.<br/><br/>I did put 'spoilers' at the top but it seems to be no use as it looks like everyone saw it on opening day! This film was so visually engaging and action packed, I practically had a dropped jaw the whole movie. The special effects were SO amazing-quick, call the Academy! And, there are SO MANY plot twists-there's like five in just the last half hour. I couldn't believe what I had just saw when I left the theater.<br/><br/>My only, and I mean ONLY problem with this movie was the lack of deep plot progression as seen in the first movie. There was so many sub-plots the main theme was hardly developed at all. But, to me, this seems like ""The Two Towers"" of the series, to me- a sort of 'filler' movie in a way- and, in my predictions, the third one will be *awesome*.<br/><br/>Despite the lack of plot development, the movie left SO MANY questions unanswered (a good thing-as long as they are answered in the third movie), like, ""Why did jack have to get swallowed by the horrible 'beasty?'"" and ""WHERE the HELL did Barbossa come from?"" When I saw those boots coming down the steps, I was like, ""OMG it's Jack! He's alive! My life is complete! I'm so hap--oh, wait it's...BARBOSSA?! What the..."" And other things are sure to be hot topics in the weeks to come, the heart's fate, Elizabeth's true feelings, and the fate of Davy Jones, the Flying Dutchman, and good ol' Bootstrap. Will, well, Will keep his promise to stab the heart to save his father? Will Elizabeth discover that she really loves Jack? (Poor Will if that happens) I know Jack is in the third movie, but, like, HOW? AND BARBOSSA? GAHHHH!!! All in all, this was an awesome film that will keep me awake in bed for weeks, wondering what will happen in the third movie. GO SEE IT! (Dunno why I'm saying that, everyone already has! :D)"
"dogbrain311","8","1","2","7 July 2006"," Yo, ho, yo, ho, the pirate life is definitely for me!! Bigger and badder than the original! An absolute must see!
","The time has finally arrived again to lick your lips and put the key in the ignition to go see the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie! Like many of you, I could not wait until we got to experience another adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner, and Elizabeth Swann  better known as Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Keira Knightly.<br/><br/>As you probably know, Disney gave producer Jerry Bruckheimer the green light to shoot the second and third movies together. That meant getting the same writers, cast, and crew back to shoot two movies back to back. Jerry immediately got Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio to write both scripts  or at least a draft of both story lines; Ted and Terry wrote the first Pirates as well. In my opinion, they decided to make these two films have an epic feel  especially with this second one leading straight into the third film. There are many references regarding the first film, but many story lines are geared towards a third film. <br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest picks up a little bit after the original; Will and Elizabeth are still wanted by the police for helping Jack escape. Jack, on the other hand  well, let's just say his entrance will speak for itself. But I will say, Will and Elizabeth seek out to help Jack once again.<br/><br/>There are a few new characters to the game this go-round. Jack's main nemesis is the sea creature Davy Jones, played brilliantly by Bill Nighy. The CG work they did on him is incredible  he's got a sort of sea creature look to him - a half man, half octopus. Whatever it is, it's amazing  he's got several tentacles coming out of his face - no nose, but he's got a side blow hole. And to top off his pirate-esquire motif, he's equipped with a wooden peg-leg. Seeing what the artists did with Bill Nighy and Davy Jones is almost worth the price of admission alone!<br/><br/>Davy Jones also has somewhat supernatural powers  he can transform himself underwater into a giant octopus-killing machine, over taking whole ships and sinking them into the bottom of the ocean.<br/><br/>Jack has a debt to repay to Davy  after helping Jack become the captain of the Black Pearl, Davy wants his pay back now. Davy's after Jack and the Black Pearl in this adventure, and he'll stop at nothing to destroy both. Jack gets a visitor late at night on the Pearl from Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's father. Played by Stellan Skarsgard, Bootstrap warns Jack of his impending demise, but Jack discovers a way to get out of repaying Davy  send Will to do the job.<br/><br/>After Jack discovers a treasure chest that is the key to getting out of his debt with Davy, his number one priority is finding out where the key is to open the chest  and then to find out where the chest is.<br/><br/>Throughout the film, you realize how much fun Johnny Depp has with the Jack Sparrow character  his movements, his voice; his body language is just awesome, and hilarious at times. The character who changes the most from the first to the second has to be Orlando Bloom's Will Turner. You really get to see the action side of Will in this second film; in one sequence, Will, Johnny, and British military head Commodore Norrington are sword fighting on top of a moving water wheel. You also get to see Will's emotional side when he realizes he might be losing his love, Elizabeth, to Captain Jack. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, we don't get to see much of Keira Knightly's performance come out in this film; she's kind of the back story, which hopefully will really shine in the third. But, it all leads up to that third film. And that's not to say she's not featured heavily in the film; she most certainly is  and she has to make a very important decision towards the end, one that could cost her Will. What I mean by my earlier statement is her story really won't get told until the third film.<br/><br/>In the pirate land, they meet up with a fortune teller, Tia Dalma, played by Naomi Harris; her on-screen presence is great! She's tells Johnny and Will what they're in store for when battling Davy and his crew. <br/><br/>Her role is a bit small in this movie, but Naomie mentioned how she gets into the mix in the third film. That's definitely something to look forward to - a fortune teller on a pirate adventure!<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's chest is an amazing trip on land and sea that will leave you breathless at the end and waiting until next year for the third movie, World's End! I certainly can't wait to see how Ted and Terry write up the finale of the trilogy! I'm telling you  you will love this movie! Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an absolute must-see!"

Also I couldn't really understand the witch doctor's lady talk. Confusing. Bringing Norington back into the picture was very good writing, along with Barbossa. Also the mystery of the compass was solved, meaning what it did and stuff. Other than all of those things the movie was great and i would definitely see it again, and again, and again. Grade A movieness. The only reason i gave it a 9 is because no movie deserves a 10. Then if you saw a better movie what would you rate it? An 11? exactly."

In fact, it is as good as the first one, if not better because it is funnier AND it has great action scenes.<br/><br/>The cast is back (with a few surprises) and their performances are as engaging as they were the first time around. I liked Johnny Depp better in this movie - his character shows more dimension.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom still reminds me of Errol Flynn, incredibly handsome and dashing on screen; the camera loves that young man. Keira Knightley has more to do in this movie and she delivers.<br/><br/>I don't want to reveal plot points. I do warn you, though, that young children should not see this movie because it has scenes that would be scary to them (I should know, I am an Elementary School Teacher).<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is that the movie could have been shorter.

"WhatsYourPoint","6","1","2","7 July 2006"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Empire Strikes Back Redux
","Here it is: the long awaited sequel to everyone's favorite pirate movie, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. Was it worth the wait? In a lot of ways, yes it was. The movie delivers in many facets: humor, action, adventure, and of course, detestable villains. The actors stay consistent in their roles, never catering to over-the-top caricatures of their characters.<br/><br/>However, the movie suffers from overall plot structure. The first ludicrous twenty minutes is completely useless to the story (except if you consider the end at the credits). Dead Man's Chest feels a lot like Empire Strikes Back in plot, but that can be forgiven. What make me maddest about the plot though is the fact that it has to be told in two parts. This makes the first movie stand alone and the next two linked together as one self-contained story. Pirates is no longer a trilogy, but two films, much like a preceding ""trilogy"" like The Matrix.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest also guises itself as a rehash of the first movie. Many jokes are reused and the enemies are very similar (invincible). However, this one is different in the fact that it is more of a cartoon. Jack and Will should have died in a few places, but I guess they were suffering from ""Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible III Syndrome"" (it's impossible to die!). <br/><br/>Alas, these last trifles are minor and the movie is very entertaining for what it's worth. And it does make me excited for the third movie coming out in 2007. Overall, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is an enjoyable sequel, even if it is shadowed by the greatness of its predecessor somewhat."
"RCWjr","8","1","2","7 July 2006"," A solid second outing
","This film does for the Pirates franchise what Empire Strikes Back did for the original SW trilogy. It sets in motion perils and obstacles for our heroes. It further embellishes upon the characters that were introduced in the first film. It amps up the action and brings in new characters with flair. All of this equals to a really good follow-up to one of the biggest surprise hits of 2003.<br/><br/>Jack is back and he has never been better. Depp brings him full on and you love every minute of it. Knightly and Bloom are given much more dramatic meat this time and they feast aplenty. Both are in fine form. Majority of the main supporting cast from the first film are here and they again deliver. There are some new baddies introduced, the best of those being Davy Jones. Through the great character work of Bill Nighy and the fantastic craftsmanship of the ILM folks, Davy Jones is a wonder to watch.<br/><br/>If there is anything that could be complained about is that there is so much more of everything, it leaves you feeling a bit like Jack after a night with his beloved Rum. But that is a minor complaint.<br/><br/>The ending leaves us with perfect surprise and peril that we MUST see the third film to see how it all turns out."

","So I was madly in love with the first one, so naturally when I heard they were making a second one, I was needless to say, ecstatic. I followed the status very closely, and did what I almost never do, I didn't watch any of the clips from the movie. Why? Because I wanted the entire movie to be a new surprise to me, which it was.<br/><br/>I went to the midnight showing of it last night, and was almost worried about it being 2 and a half hours long, but I discovered that I really didn't care. You get so wrapped up in the action of the movie that you almost become a part of it. The sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth was so great in this one that you just wanted to cry a little (I won't say anything further on that, it might be considered a spoiler). The script was well done and the actors all did a fine job (including Orlando). When Jack came on screen for the first time the theater erupted in cheers.<br/><br/>I have done something I have never done in a movie theater before, and that is nearly stand up and scream at the screen. I was yelling a the screen during some parts, and my heart was racing during many of the intense battle sequences. This movie had an amazing storyline that sucks you into it and won't let you go because there is constantly something happening. It was a good pace and easy to follow,(I don't know what the critics were on about) of course there is some thought needed to understand the move (like all good ones; you do need to think), and it leaves you on edge for the third movie.<br/><br/>But like all movies it does have some flaws but that's okay, you just can't think to yourself ""well that could never happen"", well neither could Barbossa and his crew being cursed and never being able to die like in the first Pirates. But it was a great movie overall and I want to see it again and again!"

Non stop action and characters that keep you guess, not just a plot.<br/><br/>here comes a bit of a spoiler...<br/><br/>when the eye candy of the movie kisses jack, is all because she wanted to get him stuck on the ship, or mixed with feelings towards him/ wanting to save her own hide and becoming more like a pirate. and when she cry's towards the end, is it more because she just feels bad or again because she has feelings? i really don't feel like waiting a year to figure this out."
"chrissyafrica","8","1","2","7 July 2006"," entertaining for a bit too long
","the first pirates owed much, if not all, its success to johnny depp's ballsy, unique choices in creating the lovable captain jack sparrow. no surprise, then, that here Jack moves to the forefront of the story. though entertaining, his efforts are not quite as successful the second time around due, unfortunately, to the obsessive media attention that surrounded depp's unusual performance the first time. that being said, this film is still quite fun, if a half hour too long. <br/><br/>Verbinski indulges in ultra long fight scenes (perhaps to make up for the wayward plot line). There are several cute and witty moments within the fights and tiny Keira gets her wealth of fighting. One fun moment comes as she and 2 of Sparrow's men run from and fight a whole host of beastly evil things while tossing only 2 swords between the 3 of them. the last few fights are repetitive, though, and would have been well served with a more daring editor. <br/><br/>as far as sequels go, this film successfully brings back most of the entertaining characters from the original with surprisingly ease. Naomie Harris, Mackenzie Crook, Lee Arenberg among others add a spirited kick to the film as well. like the dead men of the original, the special effects are superb. the evil creature men are perhaps a bit too graphic for the youngest.<br/><br/>let's hope the third doesn't finally run poor ol' jack into the ground."
"sackjigler","8","1","2","7 July 2006"," Survives the Hype
","It is almost impossible in the age of cinema today to live up to the hype that is brought upon blockbuster movies. It is even harder to make a sequel to the ones that actually do, and still make it a great movie. Sequel are much harder because you working with something that isn't original, and still trying to capture what made the first one so great. Well POTC 2 delivers what we have been hoping for. It is the first time in a long time where a sequel has felt original to me, like it was its own movie without the first. Granted, it is a direct continuation, but still feels new. Johnny Depp reprises his Jack Sparrow role with as much fun as he did the first time around and once again steals the show. The action scenes are excellent, although I do feel they used the beast a little too much toward the end. The other players all have their moments and it all comes together quite nicely. The effects this time around, mainly of Davy Jones and his crew, are quite good. I really don't want to give too much away toward plot and what not so Ill close it like this. The sequel is not quite as good as the original, but still excellent. The running time is very long, but it goes by fairly well, and the returning members from the original really make this worth seeing. Its true what you've heard, this does end on a cliffhanger, but a great one that is worth cheering for, and definitely makes you want more. I cant wait for part 3."
"fideliscerberus","1","3","12","8 July 2006"," A good sequel? I think not
","No offense to all, but I thought the movie was a mixture of fantasy and crap, I call it ""FantiCrap"". I found the movie utterly disappointing compared to the first one and it apparently leads to no where. The only things that I will comment on that captured my attention was the acting, special effects and of course Captain Jack Sparrow. I also thought that Davy Jones was a wonderful character to introduce.I found the first one captivating and a bit interesting, but sequel didn't make me do anything but laugh at the people who was packed in this theather. To think I went to see it on opening day and the first show of the day. At the rate of this, the third movie might not be worth my time."
"charchuk","5","3","12","6 July 2006"," Disappointing sequel
","Unfortunately, this is nowhere near the brilliance of the first film. Displaying little of the original's charm or wit, it attempts to blow the viewer away by having outlandish action scenes and slapstick comedy that is neither charming nor witty. I felt little to no connection to the characters - even Jack Sparrow himself - and was not even wowed by some of the big action scenes. That's not to say that this is a bad movie; it's just not nearly as good as the first one.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly complicated, with far too many sub-plots. Regrettably, the writers attempted to bring all the characters back and fit them into the story, which leads to some unneeded scenes and extraneous story lines. The first act of the movie - with the tribal natives - is completely unnecessary and could have easily been cut to shave half an hour or so off the running time - something that is sorely needed. Although this is only a few minutes longer than the first, it feels a lot longer - perhaps because the action gets to be a bit too much. The film is trying so hard to be fun that it feels far too forced, and the big action scenes just become monotonous. I actually felt kinda bored at parts, something I never experienced during the first film.<br/><br/>The acting is somewhat decent, with Depp giving another great performance, though admittedly not one as good as the first one. Bloom is the same, Knightley is actually worse, but Nighy as the villain and Skarsgård as Bootstrap are both great. The comedy is much less effective this time around, as there are far fewer funny lines, and it seems the writers had to resort to crude slapstick to bring about more laughs. The fight scenes seem to drag on for too long, though they are well-staged. There's none of the great meld of comedy and action that made the first so memorable - here, it's all very wooden and rigid, nothing feels natural. It's a bit painful to watch at times, actually.<br/><br/>That's not to say that everything about the film is bad. The film's darker scenes are brilliant - everything involving Davy Jones and the Flying Dutchman is quite cool to watch, and I would have liked to see more. The voodoo witch scene is interesting, especially the final scene with the return of our favourite villain - a very dramatic entrance. The special effects are quite amazing, especially with Jones' sea creature crew and, of course, the Kraken. There are quite a few laugh out loud moments - less than the original, admittedly, but it's still entertaining. And the entire look of the film is very well done - production design is top notch. The technical quality of the film is outstanding.<br/><br/>It's too bad that this film was so disappointing - it had so much potential, and it squanders it by trying too hard to capture the first film. Unneeded scenes, repetitive action scenes, and forced comedy make this much less entertaining than the first one. I'll probably see it one more time to let it sink in, but for now, it's a definite disappointment."
"everything_scares_me","3","2","7","21 August 2006"," This Movie Blows
","A lot of people see this movie as the perfect sequel but is was horrible. The only reason I gave P.O.C. 2 a 3 was because the acting was sub-par. Johnny Depp is perfect for the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. He knows and loves his character. As for Kiara Knightly and Orlando Bloom, they know the character but the don't seem to be in love with it. As for Jack Davenport and Bill Nighy they didn't seem to have a clue what this movie was about. Next was the storyline. What where they thinking. They pick the cheesiest sea tale (Davy Jones) and make the story so so completely far-fetched and ridiculous that the audience can never figure out know what is going on. This movie blows in all sense of the word and I would never recommend anyone sees it (the first one is so much better)"
"oiAMthatGUYo","4","2","7","20 August 2006"," Lacks substance
","I came to the theater expecting the movie to be filled with action and for the movie to have a storyline that kept me wanting to see more. The film did have it's action, and there wasn't really a break from the constant movement. The thing was that it was too filled with special effects and action sequences, it's my firm belief that effects are great unless they're overdone. Unfortunately, it was overdone. It seemed that they just wanted to push out a movie to capitalize off the previous movie's success and didn't care as long as they got it out there. It wouldn't of been as bad if the movie hadn't of been as long as it was or if it had been building towards something meaningful, but it was dragging on for no real reason. The ending was terrible as well.<br/><br/>So, in all, I'd say I was disappointed. The main theme of my criticism is that action is fabulous but when it's overdone it doesn't sit well in one's stomach. I'm going to see the third one hoping it recaptures some of the first film's magic, but I won't be holding the same expectations I was holding for this film."

And of course... Keira Knightley was as beautiful as in the first.<br/><br/>The film has humour, comedy and it is very serious at times. The flying Dutchman was really frightening when you first see it but you get used to the creepy sea ghouls and when Will is sent onto it to find the key for the dead mans chest it is really weird because its all quiet and there are sailors going about there daily business even though the ship has run aground.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the film because it had humour, fighting and there were parts when it was scary.

"hsinaad","10","2","7","14 July 2006"," Dead Man's Chest: Better than the first
","In my humble opinion, DMC was better than COTBP in many ways. Don't get me wrong, Curse of the Black Pearl is one of my all-time favourite movies, but even I had to admit that the second one was simply amazing. Many people that have voted or posted their comments have said that Dead Man's Chest was comparable to Empire Strikes back (a sentiment I thought of as soon as I left the cinema), when others have said Matrix Reloaded would be a more apt comparison. I believe that the people who agree with the latter must remember that the first made the impression on all of us because everybody was surprised that COTBP, a movie based on a theme park ride, would obtain the phenomenal success that it did, and therefore had a lasting effect on us. <br/><br/>Despite DMC's arguably more pointless (less relevant to the story) beginning, I think everyone that watched the movie can agree that the middle and ending of the movie were clearly more exciting, suspenseful and enjoyable than the first. While the first movie had one relatively weak story of cursed aztec gold which was almost completely driven by Johnny Depp's (and to a lesser extent, Geoffery Rush's) unique acting style, and superb special effects which brought the skeletons to life. DMC on the other hand had the same erratic behaviour by Depp, a new villain whose mannerisms and backstory rival, and arguably exceed those of Barbossa, and special effects which personally kept my jaw dropped as soon as the formidable tentacles of Davy Jones first graced the screen. Jack Sparrow's character evolved magnificently in DMC, as did Elizibeth Swann's, who turned from spunky Damsel in Distress to a heroine in her own right, even managing to subdue Jack himself. Will Turner's story of a brave sidekick transformed into a much deeper tale of lost love, a scorned son, and demonstrated Will's ability to think for himself. His relationship with his father 'Bootstrap' Bill was one of the most disturbing and at the same time heart-warming sections of the film, and contributed greatly to Will Turner's purpose in the world of Pirates of the Caribbean, something which before was shrouded in uncertainty.<br/><br/>The movie started with 3 different stories, each character revelling in their personal traumas and their twisted love stories, eventually converging into one astounding amalgam of action, romance, and a phenomenal twist that in my opinion was mirrored only in Empire Strikes Back. If you are skeptical about this comment, and find it hard to believe that a Disney movie based on a theme park ride can be mentioned in the same sentence as the best Star Wars film, but if you look at the meaningful topics that this film covers, and the genius of how they were executed, I am sure that you will agree that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a fantastic piece of cinema which far surpasses it's predecessor. When you agree with me about the quality of this film, please go and give this film the high rating it deserves."
"heckchap","5","2","7","8 July 2006"," Anyone Who Dubs This ""The Empire Strikes Back"" Of Our Era --
","-- Needs to be immediately exiled to Tortuga, with no possibility of return.<br/><br/>I was bored and stupefied by the first movie, which just seemed like the long pirate equivalent of a Scooby Doo shriek.<br/><br/>Happily, ""Dead Man's Chest"" at least gave me glimmers of entertainment.<br/><br/>The movie takes an insanely long amount of time to get going...it isn't really until Nighy's crew arrive that the movie actually gets interesting. Nighy's Davy Jones is probably the single most impressive CG creation since Kong and Gollum...simply beautiful work. It's clear the real hero of this movie is designer Crash McCreery...his very specific slant fits the crew/creature designs perfectly, and are nothing short of repellently spectacular.<br/><br/>This is a far more entertaining movie than the first, but still falls short of being re-watch-memorable. Portions of it seem lifted from other movies: the escape from the swinging prisons is right out of ""Time Bandits"", the Kraken attacks lifted from ""Warlords Of Atlantis"". Davy Jones' angsty organ playing (and practically the design of the organ itself!) from ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea"".<br/><br/>Verbinski employs his cinematography to far more interesting effect here, and I'll be surprised if this doesn't win (at the very least, get nominated) for an FX Oscar next year. (I'm curious to read some articles about the movie, because many times I was wondering often what was physical, and what was digital.) My favourite scene: the entire chunk on the island to dig up Davy's locker, from arrival to leaving: every little piece was perfectly put together: the sword-fights, the chases, the visual gags. My favourite moment has to be Keira Knightley's double-take as the waterwheel rolls past.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment: the Kraken. I'm sure somebody will probably say that it was an homage to Harryhausen (right down to its mottled colour scheme), but its scenes were largely static, and -- like ""Superman"" -- seemed to go on forever. We're in an era when filmmakers need to ask themselves not ""can we put this on the screen?"", but ""should we put this on the screen?"" Sometimes, less is more.<br/><br/>Bloom and Depp coast along on zombie-pilot. Knightley's oddly improved a bit. Pryce was less campy than last time around.<br/><br/>My favourite character: Jack Davenport's Norrington, leagues stronger and more interesting than his bland performance in the first movie. I was surprised he was even in the flick, as he's barely mentioned in reviews. I'm almost hoping in the next movie, we that we find out Bloom's Knightley's sister, Depp doesn't want to get involved, and Knightly realises Davenport WAS the man for her after all.<br/><br/>Far better than the turgid ""Superman"", possibly on the level of ""X-3"". The ""island"" scene worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>Still. It'd be really good to see just ONE movie this summer that actually truly deserved serious accolades. Where, oh where, is it???!"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Must admit that the first POTC was one my favorite films of 2003. Filled with action, humor and freshness, it brought a unique approach to the screen. Of course, sequels are always challenging and usually a let down. Although, I hesitate to call Dead Man's Chest a let down, it does lack the spontaneity and spark of the first. That said, it is still an extremely enjoyable movie-going experience and one not to be missed.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski returns with a bit darker, less tongue-in-cheek approach as Captain Jack Sparrow (the amazing Johnny Depp) searches for the key to regain his soul. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley also return with a lame love story that luckily gets very little play after the first 15 minutes. The darker approach this time includes a fascinating pirate character named Davy Jones, who may be the most eye-catching creature ever captured on film. You simply can't take your eyes off of him! Jones is played by the totally unrecognizable Bill Nighy (who everyone remembers from ""Love Actually""). Watching Davy Jones play the organ is itself worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Also new to the cast is Stellan Skarsgard (""Good Will Hunting"") as Bootstrap Bill, Bill Turner's (Bloom) lost soul father forever banished to serve Davy Jones. The scenes with Skarsgard and Bloom lacked the punch one would have expected. Actually most of the scenes with Bloom lack punch. Maybe we have grown a bit tired of his simple eye-batting method acting.<br/><br/>Depp, of course, is the real star. His Captain Jack Sparrow is one of the more popular screen characters of all time. Kids and Adults love him. He is not quite wicked and not quite a good man. We can tell Depp has fun with the character, but it is easy to take his performance for granted the second time around. Try not to. It is a real pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Yes, the story is pretty weak and very little character development occurs. But that's not what this series is about, is it? The new sea creatures are remarkable (putting the first of the new round of ""Star Wars"" to shame). This is a visual (not an intellectual feast), so enjoy it for what it is ... and try not to have tentacle nightmares afterwards."

","'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' is not only a worthy sequel to 'The Curse of the Black Pearl', but stands alone in the strides it has made to outdo its predecessor, which is easily done. From the incredibly amazing action sequences, to superb performances from Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, and Bill Nighy, to an unpredictable climax, 'Pirates' 2 is a spectacular piece of film-making from Gore Verbinski.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough. Jack Sparrow (Depp) must repay a debt to the legendary captain of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones (Nighy): his soul. Eventually, Jack barters with Jones so that Jack can be spared if he provides 100 souls as his replacement. Meanwhile, back on Port Royal, Elizabeth Swann (Oscar nominee Keira Knightley) and Will Turner (Bloom) have been arrested for their actions in the first film (aiding the escape of a pirate). Will negotiates a deal with the new ruler of Port Royal, which is to retrieve Jack Sparrow's mysterious compass, in exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom. And it appears Mr. Norrington has vanished without a trace since resigning his post months earlier...<br/><br/>This movie is full of twists and turns, which do not stop until Gore Verbinski's name appears on the screen. I could tell you them, but that would be nothing short of torture. What stands out most to me is the fantastic writing and direction, because without this, everything short of Johnny Depp's performance are impossible. The action scenes are utterly fantastic, and in terms of 'wow factor', they compare with last year's best visual effects film, King Kong. Incredible sword fights are ripe here, much moreso than in 'Pirates' 1.<br/><br/>The acting is nothing short of phenomenal. Johnny Depp is in prime Oscar form, and to say another nomination (or possibly a win) for playing Captain Jack is not only possible, but probable. The way he can make this character his own is unbelievable, but every movement, every line...it all seems like Depp has it premade in his brain. I don't think I've ever seen someone play a character like Jack this well. I actually enjoyed Orlando Bloom's Will Turner this time around, because he didn't mess around. He gets straight to the point, no hesitation. Good acting on Bloom's part. Keira Knightley doesn't have as much screen time as before, but still flourishes with what she's given. She does lose a little bit of fanfare for her 'actions' later in the film, but her performance is well done, and I know this because I couldn't picture anyone else in the role but the young Oscar nominee. I absolutely loved Bill Nighy as the film's villain, Davy Jones. He has this certain presence about him that is in effect BEFORE he appears for the first time. You keep wondering when this fearsome villain will appear, so I will not tell you when he does, for that would ruin the suspense of his appearance. He does an excellent job, despite having little to no face to work with. Another performance I thought was very well done was Stellan Skarsgaard as Boostrap Bill Turner, aka Will's dad. 'Wait, wasn't he dead?' His mysterious survival is explained very early on in the film, and it makes a lot of sense. Skarsgaard does a great job of making the audience feel for him, feel his pain. He and Bloom only share a handful of scenes together, but you can definitely feel the chemistry as father and son between them. All the performances are great, even the creepy one, Naomie Harris (28 Days Later...) as Tia Dalma.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski has constructed an epic masterpiece that is good for everyone above age 9, because there are some scary jumpy moments that made me shudder. The humor you've come to expect is right there, complete with plenty of rum jokes...'why is the rum always gone?'. 'Dead Man's Chest' is one of the best films of recent memory, and surpasses 'The Curse of the Black Pearl' in every aspect comparable. You must see this film, because it's one you'll never forget.<br/><br/>PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST 10/10 --spy"

So I probably would have liked it even if Johnny Depp had got up there and read the phone book.<br/><br/>But honestly, this movie WAY surpassed my expectations. I LOVED the first one, and was a bit hesitant to see this one, because sequels are never as good as the original. But Dead Man's Chest is. It's pretty hard to top undead pirate skeletons, but undead pirate squid people are right up there.<br/><br/>The beginning was a bit, ""Wait, what just happened?"" as they plunged directly into the action, without the mood-setting preamble of Curse of the Black Pearl. But once you got into it, the plot was actually easier to follow than the first movie... I thought so, anyway.<br/><br/>Without giving anything away, I'll just say I don't think anybody expected THAT ending. Cynics might say it's Disney's way of ensuring you'll be back for the third movie, but I say it makes the third movie more of a real plot continuation, and less of some lacklustre plot tacked on to the end to rake in a few more dollars.<br/><br/>I could not stop laughing through pretty much the whole movie, except for about the last 5 minutes, where I almost cried.

I read a few reviews of this sequel and noticed that it too made a killing at the box office but for the life of me I can't understand why. It's fair to say that I'm just not a fan of the series. It's also fair to say that I'm wrong in my thoughts on it. I guess it's fair to say that I'm being overly harsh towards this type of movie but for the life of me I can't figure out who could be entertained by a 151-minute ""B"" movie that seems to forget to be fun in the first place. I wasn't too happy with the extended running time for the first film so added even more time just hit me by a complete surprised and I just don't see why it was needed. It's not like we're dealing with an epic story or something series. We've got a ""B"" adventure film that used to play to kids at matinees each Saturday back in the day but for some reason they take this simple genre and try to make it something bigger and in my opinion they failed big time. There are countless problems with this film but the biggest is the fact that both Bloom and Knightley have their characters cut down to the point where both are incredibly boring and neither adds a thing to the picture. Bloom seems to be sleepwalking through the part and for the most part Knightley just stands around waiting to be rescued. Depp is back and needless to say he's the best thing about the picture but at the current running time I was even growing tired of him by the 90-minute mark. Depp at least seems to be in on the fact that this is a ""B"" movie and makes his character fast and fun. The rest of the supporting players were all rather bland but I will say Geoffrey Rush was good in his few moments. Once again the film is full of CGI, which is both hit and miss as there are times where it completely overtakes the story with outrageous and unrealistic action scenes. The monsters this time out are rather unique looking because of how strange they are. I'm not sure I'd call them good looking monsters but I found the visual look of them to be interesting. Again, I'm sure DEAD MAN'S CHEST has a ton of fans out there but I'm clearly not one of them."

","I really liked the first, but I don't ever want to see the 3rd one after the 2nd one. My roommate bought it and a bunch of us were watching it. I walked out after the first 20-30 minutes. I can't remember exactly. I feel like this movie was completely mislabeled. It was disgusting. I am extremely upset and disappointed at Disney for letting such filth be tagged to their company name. I am only 23 but if I had 13 year old I wouldn't let them watch it. It is quite disturbing. I automatically assume if Disney is going to put their name on it that they would take some pride in their work, but apparently not. I was so offended. The images and actions of certain people at the island in the beginning was enough for me to ban all three movies for the rest of my life. I will be wary of Disney from now on.<br/><br/>This movie is offensive and I believe inapprobiate for children."

","This movie once again reminded me of how ""going Hollywood"" can ruin movies. This movie is the second matrix, but with worse writing. <br/><br/>The story goes nowhere (hopefully some ends will be tied in the third one), and there are a number of unnecessary clips and one-liners.<br/><br/>I would rate this even lower if I didn't enjoy the special effects and acting of Captain Jack Sparrow. This second installment has holes all over and is borderline awful. I almost walked out in many scenes, and thought some characters were pointless. It was more boring than any of the Lord of the Rings, and doesn't deserve the credit it will probably get."
"nobbytatoes","9","2","8","6 July 2006"," more wild adventure
","On the day of Elizabeth's and Will's wedding, the weather forebodes another mood. Both are arrested by Cutler Beckett, for accessories in the escape of Captian Jack Sparrow. Striking a deal with Beckett, Will is set to find Sparrow and awarded a full pardon on the return with a possession held by Jack; though Jack has his own Problems. Sent a message by Bootstrap Bill, Jack has been given the black spot, marked for Davy Jones on a debt Jack has to repay.<br/><br/>When the idea of a sequel comes around, it's actually quite exciting. When you love a movie, you can't help but want another film to spend time with the characters. Though the down side of a second installment to a film is the terrible, often terminal disease Sequalitise. Every thing is done bigger and ""better"", with more action that suffocates, while you watch your beloved characters shrivel away into mediocrity. Thankfully Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest survives this fatal blow.<br/><br/>Writers of the first POTC; Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, have once again stuck gold, delivering one engulfing adventure. Digging deeper into pirate mythology, this goes beyond the simple realms of pirates searching for treasure; treasure that isn't silver and gold. Characters are developed further, with more dimensions and further layers to reveal, while introducing new characters that are deeply developed.<br/><br/>Much to many sequels, the action over runs and ultimately ruins the film. The action is quite sparing, in the sense that the action scenes are spread out and organically evolve from the story and characters, not the story playing second fiddle to the action. The characters are the real driving force of the film, with Sparrow's hyperbolic idiosyncrasies leading the front. Direction from Gore Verbinski makes the action so interesting, with intricate and engaging shots, adding a fast ferocity with a unrelenting grip.<br/><br/>With the original cast reprising their roles, Johnny Depp steals and takes over every scene. He is so charismatic and brings so much wit with simple gestures. Never much an Orlando Bloom fan, he has actually matured second time round, dropping the love lorn stares and angst. Keira Knightley isn't that strong as the rest of the cast. Bill Nighy is so unrecognisable as Davy Jones, yet perfectly cast for the role.<br/><br/>With the inevitable opening for the third installment, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest carries the same wild adventure as the first."
"Anonymous_Maxine","7","2","9","10 July 2006"," In the oily sea, the killing ground
","When I left the theater after having seen the first Pirates sequel, I overheard two guys behind me talking about the movie, one of whom importantly summed up the movie with the words, ""It was like, all action no story."" I didn't look, but I'm sure he puffed out his chest as he said it, too. While I'm sure that I am guilty of something like it from time to time, there is nothing that irritates me more than people who walk into a movie like this, sum it up with some clichÃ©, and then fold their arms triumphantly, sure that they are superior to everyone involved in making the movie. What a tool.<br/><br/>On the other hand, my reaction may have something to do with the fact that the story in this movie is so huge that I think I would have to watch it at least three or four times before I really caught everything that was going on. The plot is hardly Shakespearean in its intricacy, but for a summer popcorn blockbuster it's pretty intense. <br/><br/>The movie has its strengths and weaknesses, but for sheer entertainment it resides comfortably near the top of the list of the current releases. Granted, it's too long by about 45 minutes, Keira Knightly has not done much to shake that pompous Britishness that made her role in the first movie (and this one) goofy almost to the point of being intolerable, the great Johnny Depp comes dangerously close to overacting once or twice, Orlando Bloom rarely stops overacting from beginning to end, and the action sequences are so long and so CGI and cut together so dizzyingly fast that there will be times when you will want to close your eyes, not to mention that some of the action setups are just ridiculous. Captain Jack's rotisserie situation, for example, shocked me because I didn't think I would see something this soon which would outdo the stampede sequence in King Kong for absurdity.<br/><br/>However, the CGI effects are certainly impressive, Davy Jones is a phenomenal villain (the effects that created him and that make up his facial expressions remind me of how impressed I was with Gollum in Lord of the Rings), and like I said, I was highly impressed with the depth of the story. I think the movie definitely suffered from an obviously exploded budget, there are times when it seems that they didn't know when to stop spending money on the movie, but for the most part I think they were able to keep it in check (the swordfight on top of the rolling water-wheel, however, is not an example of keeping limitless spending in check). <br/><br/>I didn't love the movie as much as I had heard I would, I liked Captain Jack Sparrow a lot better in the original film, and by the time this one was finally over I was numb from the waist down (and around the eye-sockets, somewhat), but there is a hell of a lot of movie here, and the closing scene will have you jumping out of your seat for part 3"
"dfranzen70","7","2","9","8 July 2006"," Nearly as good as original
","Dead Man's Chest, the middle child in the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy-to-be, really is a lot of fun, if not as wowing as the original. The main story - Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) must come up with 100 souls to satisfy a debt to supernatural Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), while Will (Orlando Bloom) must retrieve Jack's compass to save Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) from certain death - happily takes center stage, relegating the latter's romance to second-banana status. And that's a jolly good thing, too, because if there's anything to sink this wave-soaring vessel, it'd be a treacly kissy-kissy subplot.<br/><br/>From the outset, bad things are afoot. Jack finds out the time's come to repay his debt to Jones, who commands a huge kraken to destroy ships. So Jack sets aground on a small island, which unfortunately is the home to a cannibal tribe. It's okay, though, because they think Jack's their god, but not so okay when they decide they need to free him from his fleshy existence - by killing and eating his crew.<br/><br/>Will's sent by the new Lord, Cutler Beckett, to grab Jack's compass, else Will and Elizabeth will be killed. See, the compass leads to a key, which leads to a chest, the chest of one Davy Jones, and isn't it nice when the plot kind of comes full circle like that? I've always loved Johnny Depp. This is his first time in which he plays the same character in more than one movie; he's long been known as a stylish character actor, and the original Pirates made him more of a leading man. His Jack Sparrow is at once iconic and iconoclastic, daring you to like him and root for him despite all evidence to the contrary. Is he a treacherous scoundrel, or will he fight for his friends? Depp is clearly in his element here, making Sparrow his own - I don't think Disney would be able to find a suitable replacement, should the need arise.<br/><br/>Bloom his more than his equal as Will Turner, which was a bit of a surprise. I liked him in the original, of course, but I thought he was a bit overshadowed by the nuanced Depp performance. Bloom's Turner here, though, is more commanding and charismatic, idealistic where Sparrow is ambiguous, a powerful performance.<br/><br/>Knightley could have been just another pretty face, pouting and showing off her gleaming choppers, she instead is every bit as towering and rambunctious as her male counterparts, slashing and dashing about in a mad frenzy of catlike grace. Compare her work here to that in Domino, which featured a modicum of violence of its own sort, and it's a favorable comparison indeed. Where's the mouselike Knightley I see on red carpets? The final big star of the movie is the special effects and action scenes, from the massive kraken to sinking boats, from plenty of swordplay to chases through jungles and forests. It's a true testament to the on screen magic that while one never stops to think, ""How could this possibly happen?"" one is also never overwhelmed by the bigness, the spectacle, the exasperating premise that louder is better. But the Whoa factor is in full effect, make no mistake.<br/><br/>Full of spit and verve best suited to an angry pirate, Dead Man's Chest is full of what The Curse of the Black Pearl gave us. More of the same, in this instance, is well worth it, matey!"
"C22Man","8","1","3","26 January 2014"," I have to admit...I really enjoyed Dead Man's Chest
","I'm going to present a somewhat 'unpopular' opinion when I say that Dead Man's Chest is probably my favourite of all the Pirates of the Caribbean films. The film is frequently overlooked, seeing as it is sandwiched between the surprisingly brilliant Curse of the Black Pearl and the confusingly bloated At Worlds End. Does it have faults? Of course it does, but it doesn't take away too much from the extremely enjoyable adventure that it is.<br/><br/>This time round Captain Jack Sparrow is informed that he still has a blood debt with the legendary Davy Jones. Jack realises that he must find Jones' heart in order to rid himself of Jones and potential damnation for all eternity on the Flying Dutchman. Both Will and Elizabeth are roped into things when they are arrested and told that they will only be released if they find Jack's compass for the seedy Cutler Beckett. Believe me when I say this, there truly is a lot going on within the films plot. It's good that it doesn't get too complicated to follow, but it is constantly building upon itself. It could get away with a flimsy plot due to the concentration on adventure, so I'm glad it is trying to create an interesting storyline.<br/><br/>What I really enjoy in the film is that it is just shamelessly entertaining, you don't get the feeling that the film is trying to do anything but keep you entertained and tell a gripping adventure tale. Sometimes films like that can feel pointless or forced, but the film has its heart in the right place and it never tries to be something it is not. It does remind me of swashbuckling films of old that simply relied on offering you some fun.<br/><br/>After his Oscar nomination from the first film Johnny Depp returns and is just wonderful as everyone favourite pirate Jack Sparrow. There is just something so likable and entertaining about the character that Depp manages to play out to perfection. His slightly surly confidence and clumsy attitude is what does the trick, Depp just has the mannerisms that fit the part and even the slightest actions is made hilarious by him. When he is on screen things light up and I cannot help but laugh<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. Bill Nighy adds his usual quirky ticks and style to Davy Jones under heavy CGI, making an intimidating and complex villain. I really like Kevin McNally as Sparrow's superstitious right hand man Gibbs, it's a very likable and laid-back performance again. Jack Davenport is back the now run down drunkard Norrington adding more layers to the character. Stellan Skarsgard is solid as always as Will's haunted father and Tom Hollander is enjoyable are the slimy Beckett. The whole crew of the Pearl are always very amusing and have some very funny traits, like Cotton's parrot. <br/><br/>The only actors I really have issues with are the other two leads. Orlando Bloom hearkens back to the good looking leads of old adventure flicks, but the guy is just plain dull. He just a bland actor and his stifled delivery always comes off as awkward. Keira Knightly is not much better, she just comes off as annoying and is also just a bland actress. I don't think the characters are bad, just the actors weren't right for the roles.<br/><br/>The visuals of the film are extremely impressive. The locations alone look fantastic, whether they be at stormy sea or a white sand beach. The sheer amount of money the film cost to has clearly been used very well in order to make the film a visual feast. The CGI is amazing. The crew of the Flying Dutchman for example are all CGI added on to actors and the details look so lifelike is it hard to believe it isn't. The CGI on Davy Jones looks incredible and the sheer detail that has been put into his creation must be applauded. The seas look vast and dangerous, adding levels of suspense as the crew travel from place to place. The Kraken is another CGI piece that is used well and looks amazing. The action set- pieces are excellent as usual. The triple sword fight inside a rolling water mill is absolutely superb, both from a visual standpoint and as an entertaining action scene. The climatic ship battle is also outstanding. <br/><br/>The films tone manages to be balanced nicely. Is the humour still here? You better believe it. Jack's first appearance and escape from a native tribe are truly hilarious. It's the small amusing things that complete the comedic sensibility. Depp's spaced out expressions, the quirks of the Pearl crew and even Tom Hollander's droll delivery are all small things that add to the humour. There are some darker elements, but the film only concentrates on them slightly which is understandable. Hans Zimmer delivers another excellent score which creates a sound that evokes the perfect balance of excitement and tension.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest is the example of a middle film done right in my eyes. It doesn't try anything too different to the first film, but it does move away enough to feel like its own entity as well as a continuation of the story. The film was by no means perfect, the plot does have a bit too much going on at times and the large amounts of CGI can get excessive. Yet the pure entertainment style is very welcoming, the action is spectacular, Johnny Depp is hilarious once again and all kinds of humour are present here. I think Dead Man's Chest is as good as the first and an exceedingly enjoyable adventure romp."

","The second installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise is surprisingly great. Of course, the first film is better but this is not too far behind. The CGI is amazing.

He must steal Jone's heart or he will spend a lifetime in servitude. Meanwhile, Will and Elizabeth are arrested and are due to hang unless they can get the help of Jack.<br/><br/>The characters/acting is good as the original especially Johnny Depp. I liked the new characters especially Davy Jones. There is even a nice surprise at the end.<br/><br/>Overall, this is another great pirates movie. This may be a little long. I rate this film 9/10."
"Ziya90","10","1","3","16 February 2010"," a masterpiece of blockbuster
","I don't like audience driven, crowd pleaser movies at all, but Dead Man's Chest is not one of those even if it comes from mainstream cinema. That's why I think that it is a masterpiece. Its low rating is not understandable for me. Critics don't like blockbusters, because probably they cannot see art in those movies and there is one more reason, because they think that those movies are rather 'products', in other words commercial. Other audiences found this sequel very disappointing in comparison with the first film. The problem here is Dead Man's Chest is not such a movie, so is it a bad hype? I guess so. It is entertainment, everyone knows this. and yes, the movie is not an art house film may be, but it does not mean that there is no art in it. Gore Verbinski is a very good director, even if I did not like all the works he made. As said, according to many people, Dead Man's Chest is far inferior in comparison with Curse of the Black Pearl. This is very funny, because I think just the opposite. Black Pearl was overrated. I slightly enjoyed it, but in my opinion, Dead Man's Chest surpassed the first one, because it improved it. As mentioned, direction is very outstanding, coasts, sea, islands, a sunny entertaining experience. One of the best and most enjoyable parts is the part that we see Jack Sparrow as the chief of the tribe! It is a bit meaningless, but welcome. Visuals, the set design are great. As for Johnny Depp, he makes this sequence more colorful. He looks very interesting. I watched the escape attempt part tons of time, it deserves entertainment anthology in cinema. I love everything in this part with some paprika and exotic fruits. Musics are coherent with the content which does not happen often, it seems audience driven may be, but I just did not care about it. The music winds us up. The only problem is that the dog humor is dated and naive. The ghost sailors in the first movie were fun (but with a little cheesy visual effects. This time, we see various very interesting sea creatures with outstanding CGI. Personally, I enjoyed much more. Davy Jones. I liked that character and also yes he looks disgusting, but in a good way. Some of my friends could not look at him when I showed them a picture of him, but he is not that disgusting. I was very impressed by the music box scene, it was brilliant. If there had been no art in the movie and if Verbinski had been a bad director, we would not watched such a scene, believe me. I have not seen a better sea battle so far than the ones in this movie. I can't describe it more, it is such great. It does not finish. The sword fight in the white sand island is my all time favorite sword fight. I watched it hundreds of time. This part is my favorite in the movie I guess. Great fun. Musics, the flamboyant forest. I just love it. Like the sea battles, this fight is very long also. There is one more big sea battle with Kraken. The best Kraken is here. It is so exciting and bothering at the same time. Again, there is a moment, moire by sun, it seriously impressed me thanks to Verbinski, brilliant. Ohh, I forgot to talk about Johnny Depp himself. His performance is outstanding, but also Jack Sparrow in this movie is much more colorful, eccentric, funny and interesting than Jack Sparrow in the first movie."

"The_Void","8","1","3","22 July 2007"," Fastically entertaining sequel
","I can't say I was the biggest fan of the original Pirates of the Caribbean movie when I saw it shortly after its release, but it was a fun movie and I hoped that this first sequel would deliver more of the same. I can't remember a great deal about the original since it was around four years ago when I saw it, but at this moment in time, I think Dead Man's Chest is an overall better film! There's not really much of a plot to speak of, but this isn't important as director Gore Verbinski packs the film with amusing stunt sequences and sword fights, which more than makes up for the lack of plot. This film once again follows the fortunes of the three main characters from the original: Elizabeth Swann, Will Turner and Captain Jack Sparrow. They find themselves on the trail of a treasure chest containing the heart of monstrous sea pirate Davey Jones. Jack wants it so he doesn't have to join Jones' crew (which is made up of a motley assortment of fish men), Will Turner wants it to free his father from Jones and then there's The East India Trading Company, who want it too.<br/><br/>There's some really great stunts in this movie, and mostly they're great because they're completely unexpected in the way they're put together - examples include a sequence that sees Captain Jack's crew traversing up the side of a mountain while contained in a wooden ball, while another features a sword fight on top and inside a giant wheel. The locations are great too, as the film capitalises on the 'Caribbean' part of the title and dishes up the action on numerous mysterious Caribbean islands. The film seems keen to add a good deal of horror into the mix too, which is always welcome. Davey Jones' crew is truly nightmarish, while the character of Tia Dalma (one of the film's biggest highlights!) hints at black magic and voodoo. Then there's the mythical sea monster, the Kraken, which provides a number of major highlights as it drags men and ships to the depths. All the major players from the first film return and do well, while new inclusions such as Bill Nighy and Naomie Harris add to the fun. Overall, this might not be a brilliant masterpiece - but it's a hell of a lot of fun and I really enjoyed it, so it gets a big thumbs up from me!"

","After watching this movie once in the theater, and no telling how many more times on DVD, this sequel to the predecessor - Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, becomes one of the most spectacular fantasy movies to date, and the most popular...but maybe not the best, but definitely worth a watch if you're not too picky.<br/><br/>Unlike other comments from people who seamed to not like this movie, thought it was too long, the action scenes were senseless, unnecessary, and thought the movie was all out terrible. I'm going to right my comment in a critical and pleasant manner and not bash the movie just because a flaw is irritating to my mind. But I don't let flaws do that to me, unless it is a completely impassable flaw that ruins everything else.<br/><br/>I realize that Dead Man's Chest was a pretty difficult movie to get through for the filmmakers, as for being years since it's predecessor and with no complete script, etc. But how'd they pull it off without completely messing it up too badly is inspiring.<br/><br/>For me, the second one lacks some of the style and believability the first one had. Ha-ha, but it's been years since they did the first one, and that's why I think they should have planned a sequel from the very beginning. I mean, you can't just put out a Pirates movie with the most memorable, most treasured and hilarious Pirate, Mr. Jack Sparrow and not plan for a sequel, c'mon! That's where the filmmakers kind of screwed up, in my opinion, they wasn't aware the fact that Jack Sparrow was going to be so memorable and treasured, and will eventually become a legend in years to come that he would be worth a sequel! I'm just glad to see they did a swell job on this one and not a terrible job. The third one will be better than DMC no doubt, but I don't think any will stand up to the standards what made the first one which stood out on it's own without much attentions for a sequel.<br/><br/>What gets me is how the second one and third one is back-to-back and the first one is a stand-alone while they are still in the same trilogy collection. Yeah some parts connect, but not fully. But there's just nothing else that can be done as of now. What is done is done, and the third one has already set sail, and I'm looking forward to seeing it! Anyway, before I close this comment off, I would like to lay out some slight flaws that would have made this movie a 8 for me instead of a 7 if they were avoided/fixed. But the rest of that 7% is full of nearly flawless sounds, amazing special effects, some good acting, fun action scenes, a fairly dark, stylish story, etc. I rate it 7 because of the lack of believable acting, sense of humor, and style that the first one did somewhat better on. But DMC beats TCotBP on the action/adventure part, no doubt about that.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy who played Davy Jones, in my opinion, was the best actor out of all of them in Dead Man's Chest. Either he was flawless, or his flaws were well covered by the amazing special-effects. Yes, I even think he was better than Johnny as Mr. Jack. I mean, he was more worth the watch as far as acting goes and style. Johnny was only at times unbelievable, only some lines were somewhat lame, eye-rolling like jokes, whatever. But all else he is pretty flawless...don't get me wrong...he was just better in the first one, in my opinion, or flawless mind you. Keira Knightly wasn't too bad in this one, she was probably below Johnny's acting standards, but Orlando however wasn't as believable as he was in the first one, but just by slightly, he's nowhere near impressive but more along the line of just okay. All other actors and actresses were well passable and some were very believable and flawless, then some just didn't stand out at all, but nor were they in a big role.<br/><br/>Over all I rate this 7 out of 10. If it weren't for the slight flaws, it would have been an 8. Believe me, I would love to give this an 8, but I went ahead and put my critical thinking to the test. But, no matter what, I enjoy Pirates of the Caribbean better than any film I can think of!"

","I'll get the few words of praise I have for this out front: the center of this, visually and narratively, is the 3-way tussle on the rolling mill wheel. It is a clever way of referencing the experience of being on one of Disney's theme park rides. We see the action from outside the wheel, from inside the wheel as though we're running within, from a right angle to the axis, as though we're fixed to the imaginary axle, etc. ... Pretty good stuff.<br/><br/>However, this idea plainly chafes against the rest of the movie which is dreary, dark, nihilistic and NOT appropriate for the age of the target audience. Verbinski and Co. should've stuck with PG content, but unwisely tried to rope in the PG-13 crowd...at the cost of eliminating the insouciant fun that pervaded the first film.<br/><br/>And worst of all, the rest of the movie is just filler...stuffing pulled out of other cinematic vocabularies, notably ""...Temple of Doom"", ""Waterworld"", ""Yellowbeard"", characters taken from the ""Star Wars"" lexicon who are given life from a blend of makeup and CGI.<br/><br/>Stick with the first film...none of this new stuff is necessary..."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) Review: After a lackluster first, we get a sequel. I was not too hot on the first, but I got the chance to see this for free. I took it. Why did I do that again? <br/><br/>Pirates 2 is not a good movie. This movie suffers from the beginning. We get no character development, we get a convoluted plot, and some truly unnecessary scenes. Depp is back as Jack here. However, Jack is not as nearly good here as the first installment. The humor here was not as focused and at times lame.<br/><br/>The action here is not good at all. There is a scene in which Keira Knightly fights like Aragorn from LOTR. She somehow fights like this. Yet in the first movie, she was helpless against the pirates. No explanation as to how she fights like this at all. It looked ridiculous! There is a really annoying scene with some inane sword fighting on a giant wheel. While the wheel was spinning, they kept on fencing! This was so lame on so many levels.<br/><br/>This movie also suffers from being way too long as well. Over two hours of this? This could have easily been a 80 minute film. I do not know if that could redeem this.<br/><br/>The acting here was forgettable. Only Depp was acting here. Bloom is still trying to hard. Knightly is just not good. The villains here look rather lame. The skeletons from the first movie were at least cool looking. The CGI on the Kraken was not well done. The Kraken looked bad and fake at times. The CGI was not something to be proud of.<br/><br/>The Last Word: Bad. Though not a great movie, Pirates 1 was at least a little fun. Here, this is a mess. Pirates 2 does not deliver at all. This was at times more of the same with some added crap to the mix. Skip this movie."

"setenantparlamain","7","1","3","24 December 2006"," The curse of being a pirate
","When I'd first watched this film, I was disappointed. Not only are the carefree laughs cut in half, there's virtually no human feeling left in the cursed crew of new and there are few giggles on their account. Some jokes become the means of continuity and barely escape a tragic death by clumsiness. The grim of this tale, on the other hand, seems to have been taking cues from the LOTR, making the once blue production increasingly green and menacing.<br/><br/>But my main objection is the film's grandeur. The Curse of the Black Pearl was beautifully crafted, with almost each action and quip leading to the next, which gave the film that magic fairytale feel. While Dead Man's Chest retains the attention to smart details, it is baffling how many times this craft becomes completely obscured by the loud, flashy or even (thankfully rare) cheap tricks. So I had to watch it again, and again. And each time there's been lots of new to discover.<br/><br/>So, is it worth watching? I think so. If you pay attention, the film will grab you. It will tickle and gnaw on you both at once. The visuals are stunning, the old familiar tune drives you forth and a new melancholic one keeps you focused. The surprisingly entertaining sword fights remain the films' forte, and so does the situational comedy.<br/><br/>After some initial faltering, Cpt. Jack Sparrow is well back in his element, although with less self-confidence and integrity. Davy Jones (Nighy), Bootstrap (Skarsgård) but especially the little Lord Beckett (Hollander) are all great additions to the crew, and the meaning of being a pirate takes on some new, darker dimensions, too. The damsel once-in-distress runs to the rescue of a boy in distress. Or make that two. You'll see one become a man and another one corrupt. It's probably this corruption that pains me most as the only man of undisputed honour, one Mr Norrington, is dragged down.<br/><br/>When chivalry is dead and the heart deceitful above all things, is it still good to have a compass that doesn't point North? Come next instalment to answer this. Hopefully."
"yayagirl14","7","1","3","20 December 2006"," Dirt vs. slime
","Most people say that POTC 2 was completely horrible and put shame to the first movie. But the sequel is just a different feel to the first one. In the first one, everything was dirty, the pirates, the ships, the towns. But in Dead Man's Chest, it was more slime, Davey Jones men, and the cracken. So really the movie wasn't worse than the first, just different. It was definitely no Spiderman 2. Also, as an observation, it seems Keira Knightley was about half as skinny as she was in the first. In the first she was much more healthy, still skinny, but healthy. I personally didn't like her character as much in Dead Man's Chest. The whole "" i love Jack Sparrow"" thing was not very good, and how she fooled him so she could save Will Turner made her seem more evil than just a strong woman. But through all that, the movie was good, but still didn't match up to the first one."
"view_and_review","7","1","3","20 December 2006"," This one is lacking some luster
","I can see that ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" is going the route of ""Harry Potter"" in that there are going to be a series of adventures for the main characters. The first two movies are going very much like a book series. And whenever you have books or movies that make up a series it is essential that the main characters be endearing or likable. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is a colorful character as is his crew, but I don't find much interest at all in William Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). In ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" we were getting to know Jack, William, and Elizabeth, and it was creative how they were all tied together. With that aspect now gone the writers have to go a new route to grab the viewers attention. I wasn't that impressed with the route they went in ""Dead Man's Chest"".<br/><br/>The adventure and the villains in ""Dead Man's Chest"" are intriguing but this movie failed to bring me to the edge of my seat. Of course they set the movie up for a part three, but I think they need to do something drastic and radical to maintain fanfare."
"dnlcmch","6","1","3","12 December 2006"," Depp saves this boat from sinking
","It's a mere mathematical fact that most Hollywood sequels are languid rehashes of their predecessors, vitalizing in the same exact elements as if they were trying to give audiences the same exact experience they had with the original carbon copy of the story. In the case of ""Dead Man's Chest"", the second entry in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, what can be safely said and done is that a crowd-pleasing character that's in the ranks of Captain Jack Sparrow can do anything he wants whenever he wants and the audience will not squirm in their seats for a second. Without Sparrow and his crazy pirate antics, this sequel would be like rum without alcohol and butter-less summer popcorn.<br/><br/>Starting off where the original ended, Dead Man's Chest opens on the wedding day of Elizabeth Swan and William Turner. Yet, their warm day of happiness turns ice-cold once Lord Beckett, a mysterious and rather cold-hearted sort of general, places the two under arrest for their relations with the infamous Jack Sparrow. We soon discover that Beckett is a man who is not interested in either of them, but rather in Sparrow's enigmatic compass, offering Turner a chance at freedom if he hunts down his pirate friend, retrieves the compass, and brings it into his hands. Will automatically accepts the offer and is off on a journey into the open world, in search of the eccentric pirate that can't help but be a magnet to trouble.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Jack Sparrow is on the run from the villainous Davy Jones, a man trapped in a monstrous mollusk embodiment. On the verge of literally selling his soul, Sparrow makes a clumsy deal with Jones, offering one hundred souls in exchange for his. Selfishly, Sparrow allows Jones to hold William prisoner, making the young man captive on the demented Flying Dutchman, where he finds himself reunited with his long lost father, Bootstrap Bill.<br/><br/>Throughout most of its lengthy running time, the film takes on a sort of ""Empire Strikes Back"" routine, having each of the central characters on their own and with their own amount of isolated screen time as we take the time to notice their own personal struggles and needs. Although this notion doesn't entirely work for every central character, specifically Elizabeth Swan, it does work greatly for the character of Will Turner. Will Turner is like a plain square when compared to his opposite, Jack Sparrow. Yet, the relationship between he and his father adds another dimension to both characters as we see how their rocky relationship turns into an emotional bond once they find themselves in the worst situation imaginable with the wicked Davy Jones. It may be a sort of lukewarm attempt to provide a subtle layer to a not-so-subtle summer blockbuster, yet, it makes the film a much more respectable effort nevertheless. This attempt is also utilized when it comes to the ""redemption"" factor of Jack Sparrow. Will he ever grow out of his selfish wits? And then there's the ""temptation"" factor with Elizabeth Swan. Is Jack Sparrow, the dangerously adventurous wonder, really the right man to fulfill her? The best thing about the original Pirates of the Caribbean was the fact that it was a freshly new adventure with a colorful character (Sparrow) that would prove to be of the most memorable of the decade. It followed that classic analogy of storytelling that parallels that of Star Wars, in which a self-less farm boy sets off on a grand adventure with a selfish pirate in order to save a beautiful princess. These nuances and factors worked terrifically for the film, preventing it from sinking into the mundane abyss of summer popcorn. Does ""Dead Man's Chest"" work on the same level? Not quite. Sure, it's a summer action film; yet, its action curiously lacks the same level of excitement that was built in its predecessor. What saves the film from becoming a languid and lukewarm effort are the colorful characters, specifically the ever comedic Sparrow and the treacherous villain, Davy Jones, who is wonderfully voiced by the criminally underrated Bill Nigh.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, consider ""Dead Man's Chest"" to be a grand weekend rental and a movie anyone can have a good time watching with friends and family. Johnny Depp has found himself a role for the ages with Jack Sparrow and aces the character to uncanny potential. With Sparrow on board the ship, you won't have to worry about seat-squirming for a second."
"griffjohnson420","6","1","3","10 December 2006"," would have been nice without the first one
","This movie most likely would have received either an 8 or a 9 had the first movie not come out first, pirates of the Caribbean. This movie just did not have much more to offer than the first one. The amount of action was similar, if not actually less, than the first. No new special affects or cinematography were added to the mix. Basically this movie is a rip off of the first one, but instead of a chest full of cursed Aztec gold there is a chest that contains the heart of a cursed captain and his cursed seamen. Oooooh, we get to meet bootstrap bill turner!!!!La tee da. Some people really enjoyed the second film, I just don't see how you could if you really remember the first one or see it again just before watching the second. The only thing this movie was good for is setting you up for the third, and hopefully last, in the pirates series. The first was a great movie to watch, the second was a decent movie, but just not as fun to watch."
"Lent74","7","1","3","6 December 2006"," Entertaining yes, but not half as good as the first one.
","Well, of course stakes were high to the sequel of the wonderful and hilarious first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. After watching the second one now, I must say that I am a little disappointed. As always in those blockbusters they try everything to top the previous movie and so they did in this one, CGIwise. The CGI was even more elaborate than in the first movie, the ghost pirates ghastlier, slimier, whatnot. Thing is though, if you do a thing like that, don't forget to add the charme and inventiveness story-wise that made it all worthwhile watching in the first place!<br/><br/>Seriously, the kraken was great. The ships and island design was marvellous. Davy Jones and his crew are frightening and creepy, but after some time you get tired of seeing another detail to a pirate-turning-into-sea-creature CGI and wish to have a little more story to hold on to. And that in fact is the biggest let-down of the movie. At times in the movie I was vividly thinking of the first Pirates movie and found myself wishing they had done some things different.<br/><br/>The hunt for Davy Jones's chest is nothing more than a repetition of the story of the first movie in a slightly varied form. There's no character development whatsoever for all of the main characters, especially and sadly so, Captain Jack Sparrow. Heck, of course I loved Jack Sparrow in the first movie, but in this movie there's no new side to him whatsoever and even some of the jokes his character pulls off (some of the best in all the movie) only entertain because they refer to the first movie. I wish they had given Johnny Depp and thus Jack Sparrow a little more to do than just repeat the whole routine of the first movie. A wicked love twist, a turning point where he gets to reflect some of his motives of becoming a pirate, whatever... something that would have made him a little less shallow. Yup, the wonderful Jack Sparrow has become a little too flat in this one character-wise and that's my biggest complaint. Calling him a caricature of his own character in the first movie would probably go too far but I guess you know what I mean after watching the movie. God, it's Johnny Depp, give the man something to do and he'll shine so why not try something new here?<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom as Will and Keira Knightly as Elisabeth get the plot twists in this one, which is nice to see and gives their characters sort of a more round feeling. I loved that Norrington was back in this one in a very different ""shape"" as in the first movie. And I loved the ending ""surprise entrance"" of one well beloved character no one was expecting to show up. But the cliffhanging itself was a little annoying as the movie was too obviously ending to make you go see the third one. A little more subtlety would have helped here.<br/><br/>The movie does entertain, no doubt, and it was great to see the characters back in action. But all in all the first movie had much more to offer, most of all a heart and soul, which somehow was lacking in this movie. Sadly, because you think after making such a wonderful first movie, they would have learned what the audience cares about. <br/><br/>Elaborate CGI, great. But the story and characters were what carried the first movie. I hope they remember that when they finish the third Pirates of the Caribbean."
"Raptor33","6","1","3","28 November 2006"," Patchy sequel, with some notable moments
","The record breaking, chart topping financial benchmark of film in 2006 had a lot to live up to, Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Deads Man Chest provided an eagerly anticipated sequel to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" a blockbuster hit at the Box Office the year before. Being a Bruckheimer production action is set to be in abundance so audiences were pensive and excited with a swashbuckling return of the iconic Captain Jack Sparrow. In recent years, improving on an original title with a sequel has been a weakness in Hollywoods production output. So does Pirates 2 deliver more or is it simply rehashed character plots for substandard results? The film leads on where the first left off, tracking the events of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), by cicumstances Sparrrow discovers that he is doomed to a life of eternal servitude and entrapment unless he repays a debt to the famed Davey Jones (Bill Nighy) captain of the ghost ship ""The Flying Dutchman"". While trying to avert this fate Sparrow interrupts Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) and Will Turners marriage arrangements, returning to Sparrow's aid in his battle with the unpaid debt with his fate in the balance. The film displays some impressive visual effects, notably Jone's countenance and the Krakens sporadic appearance, which also provides an element of tension to the narrative. The saturated mise-en-scene, with a viridian/sienna hue adds to the murky/aquatic feel of the film and separates it from the originals feel and look into a more stylised concept, as showcased also in the artwork accompanying the film. Depp's performance as predicted is a good rendition of Sparrow, mimicking his previous style pleasantly. Its not the same and feels a bit manufactured and forced in places however. As for Bloom and Knightley, their performance is practically stale. Knightley serves no purpose in the film as such and merely confuses the plot; this is a critical flaw of Pirates 2: DMC. The appeal of the first film is the connection between Jack/Will and their conflict created by the combined fancy towards Ms. Swann. Since this tension is absent, for me the film almost falls apart. The characters seem almost stale and the film appears devoid of energy when Sparrow or Jones are not on the screen. Nighys performance as Davey Jones is also impressive the moments with Depp/Jones together give the film some semblance of structure thankfully. Norringtons involvement played by Jack Davenport is another thing that links the film together, but this also feels a bit rushed, although his drunken ramblings provide some light relief. The downfall of the narrative is the character detail and sense of plot, the scene where they are all scattered on the beach highlights this. Swann is idly serving no purpose clearly, a representation of her involvement in the entire film and most of the other characters appear to have little direction and have no real development in the closing chapters. The film plays out a story that seems to not know where it is going and not in a stylistically intentional way, the movements of the characters seem almost random at times such as (Knightleys on screen smooch with Depp) and this combined with the feeling of a slow paced film that the audience gets doesn't aid the narratives appeal being a strictly action/adventure. It has moments where it supersedes the predecessor such as the comical moments featured, but not as tightly composed. Now we get to the ending the oh-so typical Hollywood ending. Jack is faced alone with the Kraken on the Flying Dutchman; the Krakens mouth faces him positioned to strike as Jack lunges at it with his sword in a melodic climax that goes beyond the borders of cliché. This for me is a dashed, cheap method of closing the film taking the favoured 'easy' route. Also afterwards, we are introduced to Barbossa who proposes a means to rescue Jack. Then the film ends here so, we are hinting at a third film in the series with a ridiculous backdrop for a plot, atypical of Hollywood but providing no real reaction to the events that transpire leaving me empty and disappointed in the cinema. A murky-looking sequel to a hit film, supported only by a couple key performances and the visual effects included. Seriously let down by the plots sense of misdirection and substandard performances carried over a shambled overly-time consuming story, deterring this from being a good sequel. A dark tone is present also, so be aware of this when viewing with juvenile personage."
"bburns","8","1","3","29 September 2006"," This time, they remembered to make it *fun*
","In 2003, I think I was the only person in the world who did not like ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"". Everyone else I knew simply loved it. But I couldn't get past the fact that the filmmakers paid more attention to the special effects than to the script. I was also not a fan of the acting. Johnny Depp played Jack Sparrow with over-the-top camp, while the rest of the cast took their roles entirely too seriously. But most of all, I didn't have any fun watching the movie.<br/><br/>After much prodding by friends, I finally saw the sequel--""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest""--and was pleasantly surprised. The problems I had with the original had vanished. Gone were the tedious expository dialog and clunky storytelling of the original. The humor was actually funny instead of forced. And kudos to the genius who came up with the idea of a 3-way sword-fight on an out-of-control mill-wheel--a great action segment that required no CGI, just incredible stunt-work.<br/><br/>But the biggest improvement was the acting. Instead of Geoffrey Rush trying to do a dramatic, believable ghost-pirate, we have Bill Nighy (""Still Crazy"") playing the supernatural octopus-man Davy Jones with no attempt to be anything other than silly. I was also gratified to see up-and-comer Naomie Harris (""28 Days Later"") in a supporting role as a fortune teller (I predict she will be a big star by decade's end). But the biggest difference is in Johnny Depp's performance. In the first film, he had no actual funny lines, so the humor had to come from his drunken, swishy mannerisms. In this one, his dialog really is funny, and the performance is decidedly less campy.<br/><br/>It is not perfect, however. The more I see Orlando Bloom in non-elvish roles, the less I like him. And Stellan Skarsgard simply has no knack for anything other than serious drama. And the ending meant to set up the sequel seemed forced.<br/><br/>But overall, this movie was a vast improvement over the original ""Pirates"". I'm hoping ""At World's End"" will be even better."

I've watched The Curse of the Black Pearl and Dead Man's Chest one right after the other and in my opinion the last one is way better than the first one. Why? Well, it was funnier, better made, also the plot was better in my opinion, and the soundtrack was really amazing. Someone criticized Hans Zimmer for using almost the same kind of music in every movie he scores, but I don't think it's true, and if it is, well, it works! The actors fit the roles and it seemed like they knew better their characters and felt better playing them. Well, it's true that it didn't have a real end, but I don't find it annoying. It was an entertaining movie, obviously it was not The Godfather, but in its genre it was great. My vote is 8/10.

"jluis1984","7","1","3","4 September 2006"," Non-stop action and great entertainment
","Three years after the surprising success of Disney's swashbuckling adventure inspired by the theme park ride ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", a new adventure of the gang of buccaneers appeared on the big screen with higher expectations than the ones its predecessor faced. While it lacks the originality and ""surprise factor"" of the first film, it's safe to say that Gore Verbinski's new entry on the series fulfill the expectations nicely and delivers its fair share of entertainment and adventure with a joy rarely seen on screen. It may not be a perfect film, but it's one of the most entertaining and funny adventures of the last years.<br/><br/>The story begins with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley)'s wedding canceled when the couple is arrested for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in his escape. Sentenced to death, Will is offered a chance to save their lives, he must bring Jack Sparrow and his magic compass to the hands of Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) and the East India Company. At the same time, Sparrow faces troubles of his own, as he has a debt to pay to the legendary Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), the supernatural captain of the ghostly ship named ""The Flying Dutchman"". Will and Jack's interests will conflict and a quest will start for the Dead Man's Chest, a mysterious artifact that holds the key to their salvation.<br/><br/>Written again by Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the film continues delivering the same style of swashbuckling action and light-hearted comedy that made the first one successful. With the advantage of having the characters already established, the film goes straight to the action and turns the ""Pirates"" series into an epic quest that without a doubt will be fulfilled in the third entry of the now trilogy. This is probably a two sided blade, as unlike the first film, this one serves as a build up for the third and could be said that it lacks a proper conclusion following the style of movie serials of old or more recently, the ""Star Wars"" series.<br/><br/>Director Gore Verbinski once again becomes the mastermind behind this ambitious sequel, and carefully builds up the epic adventure taking it to the realms of fantasy with the aid of very good special effects creating incredible monsters and supernatural creatures. This mixture of historical setting and fantasy elements is nothing new, as the first one had its share of it, however, here the effects are bigger and of greater importance, although surprisingly, not entirely overwhelming. Verbinski's daring mix of special effects and extensive plot is risky, but fortunately it ends on a positive note.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp once again leads the show, and while certainly both Bloom and Knightley have improved, they still look overshadowed by the imposing presence of Depp's talent. The addition of Bill Nighy is an excellent one, and he manages to challenge Depp's domain of the film and successfully steals every scene he is in. Even with his face completely covered with Computer effects, Nighy delivers a performance on the level of the best swashbuckling villains of all time. The rest of the cast remains basically the same as in the previous movie with few improvements, although Stellan Skarsgård surprises as the ghostly incarnation of Will Turner's father.<br/><br/>""Dead Man's Chest"" is a very entertaining and well-done film, but it has some severe flaws that by now most critics have pointed out. For once, it's the overlong runtime, that wouldn't be a real problem if it weren't for the fact that some unnecessary scenes are the ones that cause this extensive runtime. Particularly the introductory scenes seem to go forever making the rest of the film look rushed and some character's decision seem out of character. While some have criticized the plot as ""incoherent"", personally I think that it's very good despite its slow and overlong start.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" may not change the world of cinema, nor leave an everlasting impact as the previous entry; but at least it serves as the beginning of a new adventure that explores this romantic idealization of the pirate's life. It's great escapism and healthy entertainment that hopefully will have a terrific conclusion in part three. 7/10"

","Depp et al do it again in even greater style than Pirates I. Non-stop fun and action from the opening scene until the very end which leaves one suspended and ready for Pirates III next year. Entertainment as it always should be and too often isn't. Parents might want to be cautious about taking young children as some brief scenes are gory and might frighten nervous youngsters although three little brothers sitting near us were riveted throughout and didn't seem bothered by the scary bits one iota. The special effects, CGI and costumes are brilliant, the sea battle scenes are fast-paced and not over-long and the pure action scenes are obviously the product of some extremely inventive and imaginative minds. Definitely one not to miss."

","From the beginning of the movie where Will and Elizabeth's marriage is ended abruptly to the end where Barbossa appears, I was very entertained. This movie was the best I'd seen all year and the cliffhanger ending has me yearning for the next movie. I saw it the second day it came out and I was so surprised. I kept the ticket and still have it. But, when I see the third, I will be like 'Wow, I can't believe this is the 3rd one. Maybe the final one'. But, this is the best movie I have ever seen. Also, I was shocked to see Barbossa- I thought he was dead! But when you are a Star Wars fan like me, it is hard to find a movie that you like better. And Star Wars- it didn't have the excitement this had. When I saw the last Star Wars, I wasn't as amazed. Now I know that I will totally obsess over POTC for a long time and know that it is better than Star Wars, sorry Mr. Lucas!"

"siruso","6","1","3","22 August 2006"," A high budget sequel that barely captures the feeling of the original.
","So I went into this movie with hilariously high expectations. One may assume that those expectations could have ruined the movie, but I don't believe in that sort of thing.<br/><br/>I remember seeing PotC 1 and I also remember having the time of my life. I bought the movie and have watched in many many times since. The movie perfectly captured the essence of a good pirate film. Unfortunately, the sequel has few of those characteristics.<br/><br/>Lets start with things I disliked: 1. The movie is just way too long. I saw it with 3 of my friends and my girlfriend, and I found myself waiting for it to end. I was bored! In a action-adventure movie! Don't get me wrong, I just looked at the lengths of both movies and there is only a seven minute difference. The fact is, the movie did not keep my attention.<br/><br/>2. The action sequences were too CG, edited, and complex. Some scenes were OK, but the majority of them were just too much. I miss the (comparetively) simple fight scenes in the first one.<br/><br/>3. The plot skips around all over the place. From ship to ship, different islands, it was just hard to keep up with.<br/><br/>4. What happened to the classic theme and the epic scenes of the first movie. See: The beginning of PotC 1, Sparrows entrance.<br/><br/>OK, now for the good stuff: <br/><br/>1. Of course, Johnny Depp did a fantastic job of portraying the delightful Sparrow. Sometimes it felt like his part wasn't as cleverly written.<br/><br/>2. Absolutely amazing special effects. I didn't even think that Davy Jones was CG, and found out after the movie that he was indeed.<br/><br/>Overall, a terrible disappointment that I won't see again. Of course I will see number three, hoping that PotC 2 was just being an in-between film."

","I watched POTC, prepared for the worst and really enjoyed it. It was a great shame when the film ended.<br/><br/>First chance I got, went to see POTC2, full of optimism and was left painfully disappointed.<br/><br/>Everyone, from the director down to the person who carries the props, seems to have believed that if they put Johnny, Kiera and Orlando in the same film, give them the same character names and tell them its about pirates, then a wonderful film would surface.<br/><br/>It didn't.<br/><br/>The humour, such as it was, was scant. Depp seemed to be trying too hard to be funny and he had lost some of the 'campness' which made Captain Jack Sparrow a classic character.<br/><br/>Knightly seemed unsure as to her role. Is she there as a role model, a foil to the humour, a heroine or a combo of all. Whichever stool she thought she would sit on, she fell slap back in the middle.<br/><br/>I'm afraid, and I know many people will disagree, but I have yet to see Orlando act! To me, he is eye candy for the girls.<br/><br/>In much the same way that Empire strikes back / Two Towers were sequels that set the scene for the final episode, the second installment gives the impression that the baddies have the upper hand. As we know from Return of the Jedi / The King, the good guys will, eventually, come through.<br/><br/>Hopefully, by the the time POTC3 is finished, Captain Sparrow will be clear as to what he is, good or bad.<br/><br/>A real waste of time and money.

","I really didn't like the first part of this trilogy primarily for the reason that it portrayed most Pirates as ugly filthy dirty stinking drunks, realistic or true to history or not, and allocated the necessary style to only a few characters. So with an open mind, I saw this movie and I am quite happy to say that I was not disappointed at all. Plausibility needs to be thrown out of the window and this movie becomes sheer arrogant fun. The first one third of this movie is no doubt the best and its most unfortunate that the following parts were'nt as good, but were still good nevertheless. The Kracken CGI could have also been a bit improved upon. But with great characters, great locations and great action, this movie is something you can force yourself to see even if you don't want to."

","The first time I saw this movie, I was really disappointed - it just seemed like a frenetic (and incredibly long!) series of action set-pieces, trying too hard to cash in on popular catchphrases from its predecessor, and entirely lacking in the overall direction, coherence and character development which was present in the first film. Probably expecting too much from it, I was bored and unengaged.<br/><br/>Second time around, though, it was actually very enjoyable. Once you know what's going to happen, you can start to see how it all fits together. The plot is still pretty slender, and most of the characters are much more cardboardy and less interesting than the first time round, but if you know that before you go in and don't expect too much, it's good fun. Worth seeing, at least as a precursor to film 3."
"Romualdez","8","1","3","11 August 2006"," Too long - mind you mind spoiler
","The film is too long. It's a roller-coaster of a thousand things happening, all well done, in every department, but it is hard to sit through the 150 minutes. (In Germany most cinemas show the film with a intermission.) I can't wait to see the DVD with another xxx numbers of deleted scenes or even a longer directors cut. Imagine you see the film without the comic situation almost slapstick wise, island sequence in the beginning. Where Capatain Jack escapes the cannibals. Take this sequence out, alt least some 20 Minutes I guess - and you get a much tighter film to begin with. It appears that the film has too many elements in it, and the director ""can't kill his darlings"". So what's the third part going to be like? Another 2 1/2 hours long? I hope not, otherwise the film is absolutely entertaining."

Which is why I rated it a 8 versus a 10. Other than that, I think its another one of Johnny Depp's better movies. Orlando Bloom is alright in to. In this movie, Keira Knightly isn't the most likable. Jack was funny as always, and great at getting himself into trouble as usual. A lot of unexpected surprises in this movie... I found my jaw hitting the floor a few times.

It become so drowned in heavy doses of character & plot exposition (courtesy of the screenwriters' mistaken belief that more bloat equals significant development while adding absolutely nothing to advance the plot elements and characters' positions) I drifted into a relaxing nap that last from 20 minutes to maybe an hour.<br/><br/>The persons I was with did not notice me dozing at all. Their reaction range from pleasant delight to fidgety boredom in the ponderous middle to spectacle at Kraken battle sequence towards the end.<br/><br/>I woke up the instant Captain Jack Sparrow and his followers land on the beach to locate the chest. That's when I become fairly entertained by the action spectacles, despite my missing out on the character introduction and development of a strange bearded character who follow Jack and his comrades.<br/><br/>The persons & I agree the cliffhanger ending was tacky to the point of absurdity in contrived plot twist, but we'll reserve our partial judgment when we see the final film.<br/><br/>Overall POTC2 is a very mediocre movie. Your final grade of a C is perhaps a little generous. I would give it a C minus or at worst D+ <br/><br/>I normally hate ""escapist"" movies based on absence of substance, but the first movie was a pleasant surprise that provide good entertainment without insulting the audience's intelligence.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp ""owned"" the character in the first movie, but this second time around he became so annoying in overplaying the character to schlock that the welcome not only has worn out but shredded.<br/><br/>For that I am very disappointed that I wasted $5.00 (cheap) Saturday matinÃ©e ticket to see this bloated film that should have been trimmed to a sustainable ""less is more"" length while retaining the cohesive story in a brisk pace."

The music is nearly the same as in the first film, using mainly two themes. There are some jokes that aren't funny, and bunch of scenes were very unrealistic. Despite that, the second half of the film enlivens you, it's full of action. After all, you'll say well, it was a good film, only if I haven't got such expectations.<br/><br/>As far as the actors are concerned, they made an ordinary appearance.

","Let's be honest: the decors looks great, the music is delicious, Johnny Depp is funny and Keira Knightly is hot. Very cute, but a sequel needs more, especially when it comes to the second part of a trilogy.<br/><br/>What bothered me was that I had the constant feeling the producers only were trying to make sure the public would want to see POTC 3. All that, while the actual story didn't really move on. It's a common scenario in trilogies when it comes to Part II. Look at The Matrix and even Lord Of The Rings. The complete story has been written, part one was stunning and part three contains all the clues. But part two is used to create questions which are answered in part 3.<br/><br/>Therefor, a trick is to suggest there's happening a lot of things, while actually the movie only contains fillers. A lot of action, jokes, special effects, massive destruction, but when you sum things up, very little is told. The action is good, have to admit that, and a couple of jokes are indeed sharp though it sometimes hits the edge of slapstick. But yet, That's a shame, for it makes the movie a little bit empty in my opinion, and not worthy watching it a second time.<br/><br/>Spider-man 2, good example. That did actually work, because it was a totally different story. The sub-plot was interesting enough to create a hunger for the final part, but it wasn't the main storyline.<br/><br/>My conclusion: you need to see Dead Men's Chest, if you're a Pirates lover, but one time is enough (well, women might see it hundreds of times for Johnny and Orlando...typical). But prepare for a lot of questions at then end, and a whole year of waiting in doubt.<br/><br/>Oh, and I gave it seven because of Johnny Depp, the music and the wonderful sets. And Keira. A little bit.<br/><br/>Remember, it's just an opinion. From a Dutch person. So what's that worth, right?"
"remay1","6","1","3","31 July 2006"," Jack Sparrow on Meth?
","After the notable success of the first movie ever made from an amusement park ride, the writers and directors were trapped. They had to make a sequel -- and probably another sequel, and another, and another. You get the idea. What to do about a plot? After all, the first movie didn't have a story to draw from, no novel, no play, nothing. So they hired some writers and concocted a tale involving lots of pirates, British soldiers, a beautiful damsel in distress, -- a piece of cake. Voila, huge success beyond their wildest dreams. We were ready to forgive the cookie cutter plot drawn from all the pirate movies since Erroll Flynn plied the trade, because, ...well the girl was soooo beautiful, and Jack Sparrow so quirky in a charming sort of way, and everybody else was so earnest, the monsters so scary, etc. We just bought it, big time! Enter the second installment. What to do now? No problem, just bring back Jack Sparrow, only make him ten, no twelve times more annoyingly quirky (I swear he was on drugs through the whole movie) and throw in lots of pirates, the same beautiful girl, and lots of British soldiers, corrupt politicians, monsters from the dead, etc. Another piece of cake.<br/><br/>And, judging from the box office, I guess it really is just that easy. Another huge success for a movie... based on an amusement park ride. Who needs an engaging story, or clever plot devices, or great acting? Hey we have scary monsters and lots of computer animation! I have to admit I did enjoy the ride. I just wanted more. I wanted Daniel Defoe. I got Billy Silly Bones instead.<br/><br/>It isn't a terrible movie. It is, in fact, the 2nd best movie based on an amusement park ride ever made. It just confirms what everybody already knows: It takes more than lots of sword fights, swashbuckling, sea monsters, cannibals, and pretty heroines in peril to make a really good pirate movie; but if you have enough computer graphics, it won't really matter -- you'll still make a ton of money."

","****CONTAINS SPOILERS*** My friend Juri and I just came back from seeing Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and while it received rave reviews from critics and fellow moviegoers, I found it lacking in continuity. Granted, the movie ended on a cliffhanger and the initial story promises a conclusion, I felt that this movie did not do much for the series but re-introduce old characters and the writers failed to reveal any prominent secrets of the dead man's chest that would have sustained my interest in the film.<br/><br/>I felt that the full story about Davy Jones and his love needed more explanation? Why and What made him forsake land and love? Who is Jack really and what was his debt to Davy Jones? Remember when Davy Jones was mocking him and saying, ""So that's what you call yourself."" Jones let Jack live and be captain of the Black Pearl for 13 years. But why? What was with the compass pointing to Jack when Elizabeth held it? I didn't like the flirting between her and Jack. While in the first film, Elizabeth and Jack's flirtatious antics were acceptable, they are irrelevant in the second film. In the first film, her feelings for Will had not been revealed to him and I knew that their comments were in jest because she wanted to rescue him but in this film, it was just unnecessary especially the kissing scene. While in the first film, she forsake a marriage lacking in love, this film should have re-enforced her love for Will to the fullest and her journey in finding him should have been the secondary pivotal point to the film- the first being Jack's ties to the Black Pearl and Davy Jones-.<br/><br/>I am not saying that Pirates 2 was a terrible film. The action and special effects were spectacular but I felt that the creators decided to substitute an effective storyline for this nice ""fluff"".

True, the movie does have certain weaknesses, such as some ridiculously garish costumes for Davy Jones and his crew and a convoluted and confusing story, but the movie is saved by strong acting on the part of the lead characters, especially Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp, and some pretty good dialogue.

The whole film jumped from one special effect after another, with no attempt to have the characters relate to one another.

It seems that the only way the two can escape the gallows for this high crime against Queen and country is to make a deal with the magistrate(Tom Hollander),which has them destined to twine ways with the nefarious Captain,who's got his own agenda to attend to. It seems he's managed to draw the ire of none other than fearsome Pirate legend and demonic troll Davy Jones(Bill Nighy in heavy,heavy makeup and rubber),who has a very dear price he wants the Captain to pay.

Indeed,I'm not sure what more I--or anyone,for that matter--could really expect of it. It moves at a great pace and only starts to feel like it's running a little long toward the very end. The costuming,make-up and scenery is great escapist fun,and the performances by Depp(to the point that it feels like tedium to even mention),Nighy,Mackenzie Cook and Lee Arenberg(as the comic relief)and Knightley make this movie seem authentic enough that you can taste the rum.

Also the Unic thing with Will was really funny once but not so funny the 3 or 4 times in this movie. Also the ""why's the rum gone"" was super funny on the island with Jack and Elizabeth, but not so funny the 4th time it was said in movie two. It was like they could not think of any thing funny for this movie so they just told the same jokes over and over again. However the ""natives"" angle was pretty good. I also thought that rolling down a hill was cool the first time but I think that is something else that they over did, but I do have to admit, the stunts in this one were great. That was the only thing I did not totally love about this movie!"

","What a fantastic film. Of course it can be fair to say that this sequel is there to rake in more cash than the first and keep the studio happy. However, the film is worthy of making money for Johnny Depp alone, who brings Captain Jack Sparrow back to life in spectacular fashion, while remaining a high level of continuity throughout the film once again. One downside to the film is that Geoffrey Rush (Captain Barbossa), is not included in the film until the end, however, as this character was probably second most popular to Sparrow, it is a wise choice to have brought him back altogether. The film has a great villain in Bill Nighy (Davy Jones), who is certainly more fearsome than Barbossa, and with both of them to appear in the third film, it looks set to be another smash hit. The action is spaced out well, with the comedy in line with the first. The tone of the movie is certainly darker than the first movie, which is a good decision as a new direction needed to be taken as new characters appear and story becomes deeper and we are going into more depth in terms of the characters and the world of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean."" It has been widely said that the film is too long, however, if you compare this to ""The Curse Of The Black Pearl,"" it is around 5 minutes longer, and it had to be for the new characters to have their screen time, and who can't get enough of Captain Jack? The action sequences alone are enough to sail this film to victory! Roll on ""At Worlds End!!"""
"mm-39","6","1","3","26 July 2006"," Not enough Jack Sparrow
","There was not enough of Jack Sparrow in the movie! The first story's protagonist Jack Sparrow's personality carried the film. The absence of Sparrow's character kills the movie. The dialog of Jack Sparrow is not as strong as the first movie. I found Jack sparrow's look is like Captain Morgan on the rum advertisement. Could the coincidence be a marketing ploy for rum? Your guess is good as mine. The movie drags in spots and a little too much fantasy. I believe the movie is more a prequel for the final of the series. The sets and acting were okay. I was tired for the second feature at the drive-in. Thus I appear to be a little critical. With this in mind, wait for the rental. 6 out of 10!"

","This is a great fairy-tale of a movie. Even more slap-stick, far-fetched, & outrageous than the first. For these reasons, it is a great ""I-need-a-break-from-my-daily-grind"" movie. So, sure, the plot was a little underdeveloped & so they stuck that extra little bit about the natives in there at the beginning to make up for it, & so what if the cutting back & forth between the story lines was a little chaotic...I still loved it, even though it became rather difficult to understand the dialogue occasionally. I had heard the ending was a frustrating cliff-hanger, so I expected the credits to roll at any crucial moment towards the end of the hefty two & half hours; however, when it did come, it was by no means as maddening as the Two Towers, or an Alias episode finish. So, not to worry. Go see it, laugh all the way through at the flawed, over-confident Captain Jack, & most of all, enjoy all the little scenes from the ride. This film deserves your six bucks more than any others at the moment."

"billlae","3","1","3","22 July 2006"," Shipwreck!
","""Dead men tell no tales!"" And, apparently, neither do the makers of this movie! (Honestly, let me first say that I have not met a single person that thought this was a good movie nor can repeat back to my what it was about. So I just have to wonder who is saying that it's ""Great."" ""Better than the first."" ""Terrific."" It's all highly suspect.) I adored the first ""Pirates"" (""Curse of the Black Pearl."") It was one of my all-time favorite summer ""matinee"" fun movies. Initially I had low expectations of a movie made from a 'ride' at Disneyland, but was I surprised, nay, stunned and shocked. Great story. Great performances. Great fun. Brilliant devices, etc. As much as the first ""Pirates"" is great, the second is horrific. ""Dead Man's Chest."" What a total mess. It's like they dumped out a pile of unrelated documents from a dead man's chest to fill the script. I still can't tell you what it was about. Ironically, the over-jammed action keeps coming to several halts so that two or more characters can explain to each other what is going on (exposition to the audience) yet even that is futile. I'm not sure the makers even knew what was going on. It's an exploding blunderbuss of ideas, plots, and effects. And then insult of all insults, the mess doesn't resolve. There's a big-fat ""stay tuned and pay us another ten bucks next year to finish this mess up."" (Bruckheimer owes me my money-back 'cause I sure didn't get what I paid for.) This movie is the pirate that stole my booty (both cash and tuckus-- sitting 2.5 hours for nothing...really...nothing...other than a sore rump.) I felt betrayed by the writers. I can just hear them and the producers now: ""We'll put in this....and that...and that scene/character from the ride...and we'll take Greek myths, pirates' tales, monsters, CGI...etc., etc and put it all together. Cool! We have the money. The sky's not even the limit."" Too bad they forgot the story when they added all the spectacle and cinematic parlor tricks. Sure, the CGI is top-notch. Who cares? Does that make a good movie or a good TV commercial? At least TV commercials end in thirty seconds...that's what makes 'em fascinating. My God, even a fireworks extravaganza would become boring after an hour with no plot. (Sure, the stunts/action were amazing too....but again, I just didn't care.) This was so over jammed with plots and confusion that it became aimless if not plot less. What a horrible, horrible disappointment. I'd rather be trapped on the ride for three days than sit through that again. The makers just have to know that this is not a good film. It's not even an average film. It is, sadly, a bad film. I'm embarrassed for them. In fact, I'm sick about it...especially since it's an all-time box-office breaking run-away blockbuster....but that success was built on the brilliance of the first movie. Now we've been betrayed and abused. Pirated! The makers owed us another quality film for what they promised. Instead they went for greed and speed and threw together two more 'films.' (Are they films? I'd say they're reels of very expensive footage.) How can something like this get made? How is it that such terrific writers, phenomenal producers, a talented director, and amazing actors not stop this? Didn't anyone (including masterful Depp or Skarsgard) have the integrity, insight, and care to yell: ""Stop! This is Pirate Poopy."" I used to be able to say that Depp was only in top-notch, hand-picked, well-thought-through movies with amazing roles/scripts. Oops. Now he's a commercial puppet. (I realize that may be an accident.) The writers themselves have advised others to not make movies that are ""crap plus one."" (They know what this means and you can figure it out.) Guess what? This movie is thirty pounds of various crap minus five. (And maybe plus one for the CGI.) How careless if not cruel. Taken by seasoned professionals that all know way better. I'm gonna go cry now. What a sad day for Hollywood and the adoring public. We waited two years for a grand parade, and we got an unrehearsed, panic-riddled fire-drill."
"embrace-random","9","1","3","22 July 2006"," Very familiar feeling...
","Firstly I will start by saying i do not intend this to be a huge film review. I just felt obliged to write one, because so many people have criticised this film for reasons I don't fully understand.<br/><br/>What I mean by this film having a similar feeling is that of the feeling I, and many people, got after watching Lord Of The Rings, or Star Wars. At the end you respected the directors decision to leave things in the air, (because you just knew this film had way to much content to throw it all into one film) and you were left wanting more, straight away. In contrast to this, take the original Italian Job film. That has got to be the worst ending to a film i have ever seen. It just ends, literally, with a cliffhanger. That is NOT a respected film ending. Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is.<br/><br/>I think the plot was fantastic. The first film only had one major plot, maybe two. It was all about Jack Sparrow and the Black Pearl, and the other plot, major or minor, was whether Will and Elizabeth would get together. The sequel contains so much more. It has at least 4 plots, which I will not mention due to the Spoiler rule. But the plots are full and well-balanced, and they link the characters together.<br/><br/>I would understand peoples criticism if this film had subtle excellence. I know this may not be the best example, but the film Jarhead was slated by many for being boring and not having enough action. They expected a war-glorifying action movie because it was to do with the military. But the film was about the American Military training system, and basically, in the film, how much a waste of time it was for those soldiers. But this film's excellence is so obvious, it's so brilliantly constructed and linked together.<br/><br/>So in summary, the film leaves you wanting more, it has a very well worked narrative. <br/><br/>Like I said, this is not an amazing film review. But some people may see where I'm coming from.<br/><br/>9/10 - It would have been 10 had it not been for Bloom's slightly wooden acting, but I think he did well on parts which I cant mention, spoiler rule."
"patoe91","9","1","3","22 July 2006"," Best Movie OF THE YEAR!
","I really liked the first movie ""Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl"" for many reasons, it was interesting, funny, the trauma was something that I for one believed and the characters are well explained also, the whole story made sense and the graphics in the movie were Excellent! Yesturday that I went to the movies with my friends, we decided to watch ""Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest"" and I will NEVER regret it, the first hour of the movie is really slow, but really funny, it has to do with the story, but the characters don't really talk much about Davy Jones, which now is looking for Jack Sparrow, there's not much explained about what happened to Davy Jones, his story is established by one of the characters but I really didn't believe the heart thing at the beginning, until afterwords, almost the ending. The story is great, really interesting, I heard that the 3rd movie was made with the 2nd, and that it will be released sometime next year, I await the DVD to come out, I WILL BUY THIS MOVIE! Another Thing I loved about it is that it sticked to the same actors from the first, not every movie shows you something like that. Disney did a great job, it shows that everyone involved did there best effort with this movie.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie keeps you thinking, or well at least myself, I had no idea that something like that was going to happen.. Someone like him was going to appear. This is a MUST SEE MOVIE!!! I REALLY RECOMMEND IT!! WATCH IT! with ur family, friends, girlfriend, or even alone, you'll have a great time"

","This movie was one of the best sequels I have seen in such a long time. It can almost be said that it was better than the first time we were introduced to Captain Jack Sparrow. This movie was on the edge of your seat holding on every minute. I have heard and it has been said that this movie had no ending, that it just stopped and there were many ""false"" endings. This was not my experience at all. This was brilliant. I know now that I will be first in line in seeing the third and I can honestly say I hope there are more especially as I believe the same screenwriters are involved. The chemistry of the actors is perfect. My only other comment is to stay for the entire movie even through the very long list of cast and crew."

","This movie could not have been better, I've watched the first one like ten million times, and looked at a ton of fansites, but I could not have been prepared for how great this movie was. Captain Jack Sparrow owes a blood debt to Davey Jones, and must find his heart which is locked in a chest to save him. Unfortuantly for Mr.Sparrow, some old allies need his help, to save their own skins. Will must find Jack and get his compass to save Elizabeth and himself from getting hung. The charges? Conspiring to free Jack from jail (see Curse of the black pearl) I really loved the Jack, Elizabeth, and Will love triangle, and I felt really bad for Will because A. One of his friends is dead, and B. His girlfriend's run off with one of his friends. Anyways, this is a great movie, and I recommend everyone to see it, unless your under 8 years old. Great special effects, and awesome plot. My rating? 10/10. Great actors, and great plot, how can you go wrong?"

The rest of the movie I spent either mildly smiling in disbelieve or staring holes through the screen because of boredom as yet another tentacle was clawing around for I care not who.

It was very well tied into the first movie but everything that was new was amazing, including some new characters. Davy Jones, being one of them, is the scariest Disney villain yet and Tia Dalma, being another, adds a lot of interest into what will happen in the next film.

"jeffandsarah-1","10","1","3","21 July 2006"," part two
","I have to say I totally enjoyed the movie. Complete escapism done to a tee. Some reviewers complain about lack of plot, lack of development and a wandering story line. Some people can't see the woods for the trees. It was always going to be about debts called in, if you remember the first film, and of course Jack was always going to try to avoid paying that debt, he is a scoundrel you know. And of course Lizzie was going to fall under his spell, all woman love lovable rogues. He did come back and she did betray him. Plot point here, 'how come the kraken did not follow him in the boat?' Still, suspend your belief and have a damn good laugh or two, the audience i was in laughed from a to z. just love the way jack runs."

","definitely something worth seeing.<br/><br/>I saw it on the premier at midnight here in Brasil, and I'll tell you: it was amazing! the first scene of the movie gives you a pretty good idea of what the mood of the film is. Dark and dramatic. I remember from the first movie how many people complained that nothing happened to them for letting a pirate escape, so i was extremely glad when I saw the first minutes.<br/><br/>The scenes were beautiful! The light just right! Definitely a scene to be remembered by me.<br/><br/>Not as funny as the first, but I believe it fits the atmosphere. A lot of things are being gambled between the characters here. In the adventures there's too much at stake to be worrying about honesty, loyalty and honor, and the film clearly shows it.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is lost...well, kind of... he doesn't have a lead to go. his compass doesn't work, he no longer knows what his heart desires. Elizabeth's childish curiosity of a pirate's life seduces her into actions that will shock and provoke audiences. Will's goodness is clearly shown, much more in this movie that the first. All characters are taking extreme opposites of what they were in the beginning of it all. Including Ragetti, Pintel, Northington, and even ol' Barbossa (who makes a quick but alarming presence)shows that every coin has two sides.<br/><br/>Kudos to the crew. Kudos to the old cast. Kudos to the new cast. Kudos do CGI."

","I,like the other 99.9% of the American population, saw and loved the surprising popcorn smash Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl. So with that being said, I (like the other 99.9% of the American population) was mucho excited for the swashbuckling, sequel of the high seas.<br/><br/>Acting:10/10 Johnny Depp returns in fine style, back making us giggles like school girls, and of course, making the actual school girls drool. Adding to the drool cue is a again Orlando Bloom, pretty boy extraordinaire. He does fine, though as before, I don't think an Oscar is going his way. Keira Knightley does better than before, though her character is still less than I would have liked to see. Newcomer Stellan Skarsgard does very well as Bootstrap Bill, a fine addition to the A-Team Cast. And finally the man who in my opinion steals the show and leaves the ever fantastic Geoffrey Rush in the dust, Bill Nighy. An actor I love to death, he becomes the ultimate nightmare of piracy, as the hellish Davy Jones. Perfectly cast and portrayed.<br/><br/>Wriitng: 7/10.<br/><br/>The script is all to entertaining, bringing all the sword fights and yo ho ho's you can handle, but a tighter script would have added extensively to my personal enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>Directing: 10/10<br/><br/>All I can say is that Verbinski takes it all in stride, and executes it all perfectly. Well done Gore, well done.<br/><br/>Visual Effects: 10/10 Though the effects can be at times TOO ridiculous, there are unbelievable, making you think that the monstrous Kraken is there in a documentary and not a film. <br/><br/>Score: 10/10 Though I was saddened to see Klaus Baddelt go, Hanz Zimmer gives a score of stunning scale. One of the best this year, and an Oscar nomination in the making. It builds upon the first film well, bringing back the lovely theme and now more jazzy music to add to the adventure.<br/><br/>Diagnosis: Makes your popcorn taste oh so sweet, this is entertainment in high form. <br/><br/>Final Grade: B+"

","The first film was excellent. Fun, exciting, enchanting. The sequel is long, boring, and pointless. Johnny Depp has become a pale characterisation of his former self. Didn't grab me at all. He over-acted in away akin to Willie Wonka. For a man of such accomplished talents his choices of recent film and his acting in them has been at best cringe-worthy and at worst plain bad. The scenes where he runs along the beach away from his cannibal captors just makes me wonder why would anyone want to run in that manner in the first place. The charm that Depp can so easily create in a character is lacking.<br/><br/>It's the first film repackaged without any of the charm. I guess you expect lots of Pirates running around doing Pratt things and if that floats your boat, then fine and dandy. I fell asleep. Honestly, in a packed cinema, I couldn't keep my eyes open.<br/><br/>There are lots of returning characters from the first film, in which they were adequate if not essential. Here they are brought back without any great purpose- and I couldn't remember who half of them were.<br/><br/>I know they are making the 3rd film in the franchise- one was enough for me, I have no desire to see a third."

I went to the theaters to watch it expecting a lot, after I saw all the media coverage and the teasers on the tele. Well after all the upcoming movie trailers the movie started off and right from the beginning it wasn't clear as to what was happening on screen. The usual fake pirate acting done by all of Jack's men excepting for him of course, more unfunny funny sequences, more mindless acting and some of the actors looked as if they didn't know what the heck was going on.<br/><br/>Well let's talk about the movie now, it's totally useless, boring and senseless.

"DarkKnight8","6","1","3","18 July 2006"," Fun Time at the Movies, but Ultimately Underwhelming
","The short summary is that Jack Sparrow now owes his soul to Davey Jones and Will Turner and Elizabeth end back up together to prevent this from happening. They are searching the seas and isles for a special key that leads a chest of an unusual nature. All that stands in their way in another grisly crew of another haunted ship, not to mention the mythic creature that is trying to swallow the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Overall, I will say, that this film is entertaining. Johnny Depp shines brightly and just as in the Curse of the Black Pearl, makes this film much more enjoyable. Keira Knightley puts in another solid performance and Orlando Bloom does fine as well. Dead Man's Chest is a bit darker than the first, but maintains much of the spirit that a Disney film offers (see scenes with bone cage and again with the big wheel).<br/><br/>Although I was entertained I was underwhelmed by the film. I thought the story was loosely put together and was not driven by a solid plot. It did not seem like the writers did not put much thought into how they were going to bring Jack, Will, and Elizabeth all back together and that lack of thought continued into much of the film. They tried to cram too much into the already long 2 1/2 hours that the film runs. Contributing to this problem is the plethora of characters. Although the plot centers around the main cast they bring back a lot of characters we did not need to see again from the first film and many new characters that did not add anything redeeming.<br/><br/>As previously stated, I enjoyed the movie and would not tell anyone to not go see it. I just think that it had too many faults and that not enough time was put into the thought process that led to what we saw in the theater. I am happy people are going to the movies, but not worth achieving the status as top grossing film."

","I would recommend the movie to anyone who enjoyed the first one.<br/><br/>However, there are components missing from this film which was present in the first film The first thing missing is the clever dialog that was in the first film is not in the 2nd film. The first film had numerous funny lines, especially by Captain Jack Sparrow. The second film lacked these. I saw the film two days ago and none of the funny lines are memorable enough to recall. Can you say Par-lay? The second thing is, there is not much explanation of the reasons behind Davy Jones and his crew and what ""rules"" they are subject to. In the first film the cursed pirates of the Black Pearl are revealed by moonlight. Are the crew of the Flying Dutchmen immune to everything or what is their weakness?"

","Until now x-men the last stand has been the biggest disappointment of the summer and i wouldn't have guessed that pirates would be an even larger disappointment.<br/><br/>its hard to say why this one isn't as good as the first one I mean it has all of the components great special effect good story and the tone has shifted to a darker one. Darker films has always been more interesting and it is more interesting in POTC DMC but in retrospective i don't think that a darker tone is necessary in a POTC film because the film don't know if it wants to be a dark and violent film or a funny adventure film just like the first one. which is a little annoying in my opinion.<br/><br/>the trailer features some clips on a big sword fight I thought was going to be great to watch but it was really boring and un-epic much because of the music that isn't bad but not as good as in the first film. <br/><br/>the film is too long and therefore full of unnecessary scenes such as: a bar fight the first time the kraken attacks a ship and swallows jack sparrows hat that floats by, i mean come on who cares about jacks hat anyway? <br/><br/>however the film has some bright spots the FIRST time you watch it (i have only seen it once) such as all the scenes featuring Stellan Skarsgard and most of this scenes are very dark and even scary sometimes and the first big scene with the kraken (the one that I mentioned earlier just take a couple of seconds)this scene is the best action sequence of the film and just because of that almost the same scene reappears one more time as the climax of the film but it isn't much of a climax really because you have already seen it in a better version.<br/><br/>However the acting is good and the special effects is worthy of an Oscar and as I am a special effect lover this is a huge plus for the film. Johnny Depp is superb as usual but the script doesn't have the same jokes as in the first film and this makes Depp's performance useless in some cases.<br/><br/>i believe that this is a film that becomes better for every time you see it so hopefully I will give this film 10 out of ten rather than 7 out of ten when i see it again.<br/><br/>oh i forgot! I really really hate the cliffhanger ending I hated it in Matrix reloaded and I hate it in this film to."

Well, fortunately the film was very entertaining and somewhat different (is it me, or are the characters just a little more wet in this one).<br/><br/>The common problem with sequels is that they try to outdo the first one. This is why I still like the first one better, since it felt like a smaller movie. Regardless, I definitely enjoyed the slapstick humour of the first third mainly because they didn't make such a big deal out of it. Just give the people what they want to see in an action film. Funny/crazy stunts.<br/><br/>Constant references to the previous film were okay and I was truly surprised at the amount of characters that came back for this film. The ending was a particularly nice surprise. In all the films only weakness is the fact that there is so much going on it makes the film feel rather long and the plot rather messy. Regardless we get to the end and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Not quite as good as its predecessor but a good film none the less."
"mlmilton-1","9","1","3","18 July 2006"," A good setup for the third film
","I think like most people, I went to see this movie with very, very high expectations. Were they met? Not really. I'm tempted to make the excuse that to follow a film as good as the first, is well, an almost impossible task. having said that, Star Wars were able to pull it off.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling somewhat disappointed, but a week later, whilst reflecting on the movie, I think they did a good job. Its clear that this film was laying out the playing field for the third film, and i'm OK with that.<br/><br/>Great action, and as per usual, Johnny Depp is fantastic. I thought Orlando Bloom put in a good comedic performance, something I had not seen from him before.<br/><br/>Overall, i think it was a very good film, and holds a worthy place in the trilogy."
"stepwallace","8","1","3","18 July 2006"," So many plot lines...
","If you haven't already seen the review done by ""Ask a ninja"" then go google it now - cos he's right.<br/><br/>This has two things in absolute abundance: plot lines and pirates.<br/><br/>Of course this isn't a bad thing, it's a pirate movie - and this one is happily setting up the sequel.<br/><br/>The story nearly manages to top the undead pirates of the first. Don't hold your breath for realism (but then if you saw the first one... you'd know better).<br/><br/>All your favorite characters are back, doing more of what they're good at. It's more fun than the first one - but like so many sequels, it excels because it doesn't have to do all the character exposition of the first, it can spend more time on frivolity because you already know the characters and their relationships.<br/><br/>Probably one of the best movies of 2006 - enjoy."
"sktergrlavril","10","1","3","17 July 2006"," great squeal
","Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest has a great plot but a confusing ending. There is only one or two slow spots in the entire movie. The many characters from the first one come back and in surprising ways. You have to see the first movie for the second movie to make since. It is a combination of action and comedy. I think that the movie goes faster since you aren't being introduced to as many characters as there were in the first movie. Also you don't have to take as much of the movie having to have the characters get to know each other. I think that the second movie is better than the first movie."
"rubba_duck09","10","1","3","17 July 2006"," This movie was Awesome!!
","I went to see this movie on July 7th (the day it came out) and I loved it. I couldn't say it was better than the first but it definitely wasn't worse. Although they set it up a little different to what I expected it still came out good, but the end surprised me. I can't wait for the 3rd to come out. Many parts were very funny and I loved Capt. Jack Sparrow's dramatic entrance. Seeing Will's father was a big shocker though but I hope he can save him in the next one. If I were in that movie I would have killed Norrington(the selfish jerk) for even talking to me. Some of my favorite parts were when Eolizabeth first came onto the boat and Jack turns to Gibbs and says ""Hide the rum"" and also when jack was dancing around in front of Davy Jones singing ""I've got a jar of dirt, I've got a jar of dirt!"" I am totally buying this movie when it comes out. If Jack doesn't come back alive I will be so mad, I love him. I think almost every woman on the face of this earth has to love Johnny Depp even my 7 year old cousin loves him."

","This movie was amazing! I admit that the creators were a little too animation happy, but otherwise two thumbs up!! I am so excited for the next movie! I just saw a picture of POT3! Wow!! It has Jack in a sort of Chinese Pirate outfit. I am super excited. I don't think that i can wait till May! I have read so many rumours about the next movie- like um i think her name is T something, anyway, she is supposedly the lover of Davey Jones, and it is her that he ripped his heart out for. So it is pretty much definite that Jack will make his appearance early in the third movie. There have even been talks about a fourth pirates! Anything with this cast is amazing.

It features a great story line and wonderful acting by Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly...Orlando is not the best actor in the world but his pretty face and sword fighting skills save him. LOL! If you liked the first one I not only recommend I DEMAND that you see this movie! The most fun I have had in a theater in a long time was when I saw this movie! it is full of laughs and excitement.

","I have seen this movie twice in the last five days and have to say i loved it. I went into it half expecting it to be a lot like the first one until my friend told me some people after seeing it didn't really know if they liked it or not because they were expecting the same things as me. I then decided to watch it with an open mind and to not expect anything. I found it to be a very good move although there were some parts that could have been left out. My sister on the other hand was really disappointed because she had been expecting too much. If you go to see this movie, go into it wanting to see a fun and exciting sequel to an amazing movie and you'll love it."

","This is the perfect movie of one of the best series ever. It's also one of the best movies in a very long time. I think that if they knew the first one was going to be as popular as it was it would have matched the second one better, but still, this series is on a lord of the rings caliber with an easier to understand plot and comedy.This movie was a little long but not so that your constantly checking your watch, its an enjoyable length but still could have cut out a couple minutes from the beginning. I have read in magazine reviews that they didn't like the ending because it left it too open for a sequel, thats not true it's like a two part movie(like the lord of the rings).In fact I liked how they brought Barbossa back two help them get jack back from the edge of the world, it was set up in a way where you don't know it's going to happen but when it does it's like perfect."

","This movie was awesome..If you were a fan of the first, this will pick up right where the last left off.. The visual effects/ scenery are amazing... Another thing that makes it good is that most of the same actors returned with the addition of some new ones.. Johnny Depp did his normal phenomenal job acting this role out and making our stomachs hurt from laughing..There were a lot of surprises and unique twists in the film..And this film, in my opinion was funnier than the last..I would definitely recommend that if you were a fan of the last movie, then it is a must for you to go see the new one..Now comes the hard part in waiting for the DVD!!!"

","I have been reading many of the comments -- some good, some bad. I don't know what people were expecting, but I think this movie is fantastic! I am one of those who actually think I like it better than the first one. I think that Johnny Depp's performance was just amazing (as always), but I think part of the magic was gone that was there in the first movie because in the first one, I didn't know what to expect until I saw it. Of course, this time around, I knew what to expect from Captain Jack's character. As far as the length of the film, I honestly didn't notice it at all. So, I hope those that go to see it will just chill out, sit back, and enjoy the wonderful ride this movie provides.<br/><br/>By the way, even though the credits are extremely long, I hope people stay to see the extra scene that they put at the end (same as they did in the first movie). This one is quite funny (IMO)."
"sven-goran-lindqvist","8","1","3","17 July 2006"," A sequel that does not disappoint !!!
","Dead Man's Chest is with out doubt the best movie of the summer so far!It has everything that made the original so good:action,comedy,romance amazing special effects and of course Jack Sparrow! Sorry, I mean Captain Jack Sparrow! Johnny Depp is yet again amazing as the charming captain and it's his movie from start to finish.And both Knightley and Blooms characters are more interesting in this movie,Bloom has some great emotional moments with his long lost father Bill ""Bootstrap"" Turner,well played by Stellan Skarsgård,and Knightley has some fine scenes where she discovers that she's attracted by MR.Sparrow.Davy Jones is a great villain and an extremely well made CGI character,over-all the special effects in DMC are far better than the ones in COTBP.This movie has a lot more action in it than the original and the action scenes are extremely well done and often really funny,DMC has two really,really great action sequences:the first one when will turner,jack and his crew are trying to escape from hungry cannibals(it's absolutely hilarious!)and the other one is the three men sword fight between sparrow,turner and norrington which is also very funny. Now to what I didn't like about the film:not much, but there was some plot-holes, that could have easily been filled in and the cliffhanger ending was a little annoying and DMC really feels like a middle movie because it has no real beginning or ending. But this is just like the first one a really entertaining movie from start to finish,DMC is simply very good and now I can't wait until the third one comes out!"
"flumpman-1","6","1","3","16 July 2006"," Good...but far too long!
","As a fan of the first movie I was eager to see this one and as it was released on the day of my birthday I was determined to be off work and see the first showing possible - which I did. I sat anxiously waiting for it to begin and as soon as the trailers were finished and it started I was acting like a seven year old kid who had just been given a brand new bike. It started well and had a good grip on it from the beginning, but thirty minutes or so into it I just wanted it to be over. Yes, Depp was excellent, Knightly was entertaining and Bloom wasn't half bad (I'm not a fan of the Bloomster) and Bill Nighy was brilliant as always and made Davy Jones seem like a real bad guy who you hated so he did his job well. But the problem I had was with the length of it, it just seemed to go on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and just didn't seem to know when to stop. However, when it did stop it left me dying for more so roll on the next instalment, I just hope that they don't make it an epic at 3 hours+ and leave out some of the rubbish filler that made this one just that little bit disappointing. Go see it and enjoy it just make sure you take some munchies and maybe a cushion for your rear!"

","The first Pirates was a solid film. Gore Verbinski, who directed this and the original (as well as the next in the series) does the pirates well with stunning visual effects and well put together story-telling. In this installment the audience catches up with Captain Jack Sparrow as he becomes forced to pay back a debt he owes to Davy Jones.<br/><br/>With the introduction of the legendary Davy Jones, the audience is thrilled by the cutting edge costume design, make up and visual effects that dazzle the mind. Don't think that visual effects are all that drive the film, the story is both solid and laugh-out-loud funny. As Captain Jack's adventure unfolds the movie proves that it can please on all levels from comedy to drama. Captain Jack as well as Will Turner, reprised by Orlando Bloom, are thoroughly delicious characters that the audience come to care about and delight with each plot twist. <br/><br/>Johnny Depp brings Captain jack Sparrow to life with an acting job worthy of his many memorable past roles. Depp has proved again and again that he can bring any character to life and stun audiences with his in-depth performances. With cast accomplices of Orlando Bloom and also the return of the gorgeous Keira Knightley who plays Elizabeth Swann, the cast is strong and even the secondary characters are memorable in this terrific Pirate romp.<br/><br/>In a summer of what should have been hefty competition with the likes of ""Superman,"" this pirates movie has hijacked this summer's box office. With an opening weekend over $100 million, the film is on track to be this year's biggest summer blockbuster. <br/><br/>""Pirates"" is going to be with us a long time. An ""A"" movie this fun film will leave movie-goers thirsty for the next installment. Yes, there will be another Jack Sparrow adventure.

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: DEAD MAN'S CHEST"" Starring Johnny Depp as Capt. Jack Sparrow IMDb.com Movie Review: Now I must say that it seems quite unlikely that a swishy-buckled character like the Capt. Jack Sparrow could ever earn the allegiance of a crew of crusty old salts who fancy themselves Pirates. But this is a Hollywood MOVIE, not a recruiting film for the U.S. Navy or His Majesty's Fleet. Given that caveat, among myself and a flock of friends who went to see ""Chest"" last night, it could be said that, ""A good time was had by all."" If you want to see the movie, I'd dare say, that's all you need to know. Go & enjoy it. <br/><br/>To me, it was slightly romantic; somewhat imaginative; and a bit choppy in plot & editing. But it has great sense of humour. ... Enjoy it as it is. That's right, I did NOT see the first ""Pirates"", but that didn't seem to matter. And, yes, there is ample evidence that a sequel is in the offing. Another take it or leave it proposition. I recently saw ""Click"" and found that to be more cause for thought or reflection.  If you want cerebral, read a book. If you want a swishy-buckled Captain, Jack Sparrow will swoop you off your feet. Depp's Devil doesn't wear Prada, but he looks like he'd like to ! ... 8/10. Cliff Hall+++."

","Johnny Depp as the perpetually pickled Captain Jack Sparrow is hilarious, especially when he sees Kiera Knightley and his first reaction is to tell his first mate, ""Hide the rum!"" No doubt recalling their last encounter when they were trapped on a cay in the Caribbean...<br/><br/>Kiera Knightley in all her anorexic glory did not seem as pithy as in the first episode.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy as the CGI'd Davey Jones was indeed well chosen, he has played an iconic rocker in ""Love Actually""; as well as the Head Vampire, Viktor, in ""Underworld"" among many other roles over the years...<br/><br/>However, I have a few historical bones to pick - Caribs are not proved to be cannibals even on a ritualistic basis, further, they were straight haired in the film when in fact they intermarried with Africans (who were either explorers or runaway slaves) and therefore would have rather curly hair! <br/><br/>Next thing, only black people in this movie had Jamaican accents but in fact the white people would have to have that accent first to pass on to the slaves and would have been more likely at least 100 years before the setting of this story! <br/><br/>Next thing: how on earth does a pseudo-Jamaican have a Creole Patois brother? So the Caribbean consists only of Jamaica and St Lucia, please! Apart from that, the story was interesting and the swordplay was good if a bit wild like on the old mill-wheel - are these new rides Disney is subliminally selling to the public? <br/><br/>That and the ball-cages from the Carib camp?

","I rated this an 8. I can see why other's would rate it less, but first the good points. Same cast and character's have not worn out their welcome. They are still on target with the acting and their characters. The new ones only add to the fun. The story and plot is fast paced. Photography is phenomenal. The bad guys and concepts thereof are well done and scary. Also something that I found fun was that there were some setting that were not particularly great, but I like it because they reminded me of the ride at Disney World.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie very much until the end. Also, you should know I would rate the Black Pearl as a 10. One of the things that to me added substance to the original was that in the end, it turned out that Jack actually did have a plan even though he appeared loosey goosey. This had none of that.<br/><br/>Second, they resolved nothing. It is a Part I. Personally, I like to know ahead of time that this is the case, so the disappointment level is set. They could have resolved almost every point before the bug ending and the new movie have plot points of its own. On this point, I find the movie lazy and almost irrelevant, but it is a fun ride.<br/><br/>For the parents: There are some scary jumpy times. There are some grisly killings that are not too graphic, but the concept and actions is made well known. I think its PG13 rating is well warranted for this movie."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest opening shot is of the seas choppy, merciless dark waters, as if the director's preparing the audience for a Pirates chapter that will end in tragedy. The wonderful thing about the Dead Man's Chest is that, although a much darker film with more horrific creatures and fantastic locales, it doesn't abandon the first film's lighthearted adventure and fondness for her characters. I felt as if in the first installment of the franchise, I only hiked up my jeans and took a relaxing walk along the surf. While Dead Man's Chest plunges into the opening shots mysterious sea and gives the audience a much grander, more epic adventure.<br/><br/>The downside to Dead Man's Chest is that the action is much more tongue in cheek. The film embraces the absurdity of the subject matter: Pirates who sail mythical seas, telling fantastic tales of treasure and monsters, while boldly challenging their fears for their Lives, Glory, Love and of coarse Riches. The action sequences are so much more elaborate that I fear for the third film, as this embrace of the absurd could easily walk the plank into the depths of cartoon silliness.<br/><br/>That being said, of all the summer blockbuster's that have been release in 2006, Dead Man's Chest by far eclipses the rest of the competition. Jack Sparrow is back in fine form, Will Turner remains the idealistic hero, and Elizabeth Swan's character develops in a surprising and refreshing fashion. Hero's step across the line and become Villainous at times, former Villain's become unsavory Allies, and Hollywood adventure on the high seas has never looked better."

Other than the sometimes hard-to-comprehend ""pirate talk"" and a somewhat confusing/convoluted plot line, I enjoyed my 2.5 hours in the theater.

","SPOILER WARNING!, well I was so excited when I watch the trailer but somehow that effect doesn't came to me when i watch PotC:DMC, early of the movie it feels weird but after you understand it all seems pretty clear. Overall its a good sequel but they are somethings I'm not satisfied, I'm very unsatisfied about the jokes in this movie, its practically a repeat of the first one but in different situation, another scene is where when Will, Sparrow and Norringtom fight, it was fun at first but I think they over do it (except which the scene where Sparrow is trying to catch up with the wheel) everything seems to be repeated and even the music is the same. After the first movie ended, I was so excited that I can talk about that movie all day long but this one doesn't give me that excitement, it just gives me, hmm OK not bad. And wassup with Ms. Swann falling for Sparrow, I mean this is all WRONG!. Anyway, I hope that the next movie will be better then expected. Overall its a good movie but not as nice as the first one."
"Nikkdramafan","8","1","3","13 July 2006"," Now I can't wait for the third one!
","Okay, so it's not Curse of the Black Pearl...but I liked it anyway. Two complaints: the music (sorry, but it is disappointing compared to the first film's score), and the characters weren't dark enough (Barbosa and crew were scary and creepy even without all the special effects--maybe too much CGI and not enough good old fashioned stage make-up and sinister talent?). That said, there were elements of this movie that I really liked, but most of them occurred in the last half hour or so... I liked some of the new characters (Tia Dalma and Bootstrap), and the direction of some of the old characters (Elizabeth and Norington), the ending, and, of course, Jack...gotta love Jack. We watched the first movie after seeing this one, and I do have to say the tone of the first one was better...not quite as much done for yucks, and a more serious or sinister tone overall. One of the things I really liked in the first movie was the fact that Jack played both sides depending on the situation: he was goofy sometimes, but also cunning and completely sure of himself at other times--almost as if he played the goof so that people would underestimate him, because when the chips were down, he was definitely the captain...sigh... Here's hoping we'll see more of that side of him in the next movie... Overall, yeah, I loved it...I saw it three times in the first two days... And if you haven't seen it more than once, go back! These movies benefit from more than one viewing: the humor is quick, and in order to catch all the jokes and innuendo, and also fully appreciate the acting, repeated viewing is required."
"rebeljenn","5","1","3","13 July 2006"," average action film
","'Pirates of the Caribbean 2: Dead Man's Chest' is a continuation of the first film that became a popular hit with audiences. This adventure carries on from the original one, but this time, Jack Sparrow (Depp) is back and trying to escape Davy Jones and his crew from death. Like the original, the film combines comedy and some good performances along with a creative set and special effects. It's an average action film and the perfect way to spend an evening. However, the film seemed to be a little too long, and the other problem with it was that it did not have a proper ending. I was getting built up to a good ending, but it just did not come. I suppose we have to wait a year or two for the next film to see the outcome. Overall, there were some good action sequences and good comedy, but the film needed a proper ending."
"bgyc11","5","1","3","13 July 2006"," I had hoped for better
","The first movie was really fun and enjoyable. This did not fair was well. I was really trying to like it but it just didn't happen. There was some funny moments but there was too many kinda corny moments. For instance Kira knightly is stowed away on a boat and wants to go to Tortuga's(pirate port) so she ""scares"" the crew into going there by making a ghost.""what"" was my first reaction. Also the the first 25 minutes of the movie are completely unnecessary because it doesn't move the plot forward in any way and its a little far fetched with captain jack sparrow turned into the chief of some island natives. Also works as another instance of mediocre jokes in this film. Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't this movie made pg-13 to be a bit more mature and appeal to more mature audiences. There were some good action sequences but i guess they left the comedy somewhere between g and pg. Another problem is that Kira and Orlando are kinda of uninteresting in this film. What was good was Davy Jones and the ending of the movie was good. Also entertaining action sequences. But other than that the film could have faired better."
"bigben5","6","1","3","13 July 2006"," Barely made sense
","Honestly, it feels like watching King Kong all over again. In King Kong it took about an hour and a half for Kong himself to finally show up, here it was about the same, needing a full hour before the villain Davy Jones shows his big tentacled face. <br/><br/>I won't repeat what other reviewers have said other than the fact that this movie could have been reduced by an hour and not have lost any of the drama and excitement it contained. Remember Hollywood: Less is more. Did we really need to have the whole cannibal tribe thing when it wasn't even part of the storyline? How about the whole Liar's dice scene which served absolutely no purpose at all. Is it so much to write a scene that has meaning to it? <br/><br/>Finally, I didn't really like how this movie was a melting pot for combining all different sea legends together into one big conglomerate mess. But then again Disney never comes up with anything original anymore, does it?"

","Jack Sparrows back and looking as mad as ever but for some reason i still think that Johnny Depp looks yummy...Will Turner is also back and looks better than ever...yum to that too. The story pretty much picks up where it left off...Will and Miss Swann (Knightly) are still loved up and are about to get hitched when the new Idiot in a wig sabotages the entire affair by arresting them...their only hope lies with captain Jack Sparrow who, not surprisingly, has got got into a spot of bother himself...Will Turner's father makes a little comeback, neither is he dead or alive, to tell Jack that its time for wriggly beard man Davy Jones to collect what he's owed: Jacks soul. Will Turner races across the oceans trying to find Jack so he can free Miss Swann...Jack then tricks young Will into becoming captive by Davy Jones, where Will meets his Father;such a touching moment...as this is happening our own Lizzy (swann) has gotten free and caught up with Jack and the black pearl with the help of a certain dress and very stupid crew members...Jack manages to trick her also into helping him whilst it seems that miss Swann has become attracted to him...(was hating her at this point!!) With various different story lines going on and the fact that the characters hardly stay together for long...the second edition to the pirate trilogy sets us up for what I'm sure will be a fantastic 3rd finale movie. This movie is definitely the middle rest point of the trilogy as it seems to fill in gaps from the first movie whilst making new gaps to be filled by the 3rd. The movie is not short of action...romance...comedy and big monstrous creature things. All in all not a bad sequel...it has just made me more anxious for the next one. Note to reader: please make sure that members of your party who are going to watch this movie have already seen the first otherwise they will just be confused."

Almost like a two-and-a-half hour long commercial for the third one. A lot of plot was developed. A lot of the characters were developed. But, again, nothing was really resolved. If anything, every last tidbit was left as a cliff-hanger. I call foul on that part.<br/><br/>But, look at my score for this film, an 8. I gave the original a 9.

","OK I'm 19 and Davy Jones got me so wigged out! I was pulling on my boyfriend whenever Davy Jones would come up to the screen and id point at that his face was ""just not right' lol. Other than him the movie was even better than the first one and i think we learn who Elizabeth Swann really wants in her bed, the kiss between Elizabeth and Jack was the hottest thing on screen in 2006.I don't get the whole heart in the chest thing and why it's still beating...and during the movie it made me see think of three other movies. Titanic,for the ship going under the water from the kragon eating the ship The Passion,for Will getting whipped and Harry Potter for some of the effects on the squid crew."

","well they pulled it off again....pirates 2, dead mans chest is excellent.... the scenes on cannibal island were hilarious, only Johnny Depp could make the act of simply running into a 'burst out laughing' moment...<br/><br/>there is also very funny scenes with the crew and a giant round cage.. it was great to see other familiar faces, even that darned monkey! the crew of the flying Dutchman were horrific, worse than the skeleton crew of the black pearl... they were like something alien artist geiger would have dreamed up. so i wouldn't say ALL children will like certain parts..<br/><br/>i thought all the acting was good...johnny Dept outstanding again...this role was surely made for him.. or he made it his own.... but the power seems to have shifted in favour of Elizabeth... when oh my god he is betrayed by a kiss....<br/><br/>there were a couple of things i'm not sure about... like how come the monkey stayed immortal, when the others didn't... and when will turner walks out of the sea after having to swim to shore to locate jack, he is almost dry.. but still does not stop me from awarding 10/10.<br/><br/>i should also add that dead mans chest is not a stand alone film like the curse of the black pearl... we are left at rather a cliffhanger moment, and will have to wait until April 2007 to see what happens next...<br/><br/>some people have been critical of the surprise ending, but i'm sure more explanations will come, and we will understand all in the end... this is the best movie of the year..."
"TEAQUIEMORO","8","1","3","12 July 2006"," Better Than Part One
","I saw part one of Pirates of the Caribbean and to me it was pretty good but it was an average pirate movie that had a not so good adventure,it didn't amuse me much. So later I heard that the next Pirates of the Caribbean is coming so I thought that it was going to be the same as part one but even more less amusing,but I still went. So I watched the whole thing and this is what I got to say,this movie rules out load. This was one of Gore's greatest movie that he has done.This had thriller,comedy,and plenty of action,a movie for all the fans to talk about. The thriller by me and the audience are waiting to see what the Carcan{the giant octopus}is going to attack the crew and the ship and<br/><br/>sink it to eat them. The comedy by in the Native island Jack's and some other crew were swinging from the giant ball to grad the roots towards freedom,great and funny.And the action by the Duchman's crew fighting some of Jack's crew,and when Will,Jack and Mr.Norrington were fighting over the Duchman's heart.This movie will be the best movie that everyone have ever seen,can't wait for part three,plus two more things. At the end a certain someone for part one is alive and he is bad,and at the very end after the credits,there is something funny at the end."

","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back and he's in bigger trouble in Dead Man's Chest. Along with him, of course, comes Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the two would-be married lovers whose wedding is interrupted by the corrupt and unscrupulous Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander), a true marketeer for the East India Trading Company.<br/><br/>The continuing story. Jack, sashaying his way across the Caribbean, is trying to continue his infamous ability to cheat death. Problem is, though, is that he owes a life-debt to the dreaded Davy Jones (come full-on as a character and not just a small piece of sea karma by Bill Nighy). Davy Jones and his barnacled crew take the souls of those not willing to venture into the Great Unknown and apparently Jack had met Mr. Jones previously and wrangled a deal: he'd captain the Black Pearl for 13 years, and now that 13 years is up. So, in true Captain Sparrow fashion, Jack decides to cheat, steal, manipulate, and do whatever is necessary to save his skin. Even if it means finding the heart of Davy Jones (which is stowed away ...somewhere, waiting to be found). The more trouble is that Beckett wants the heart of Jones so that he can control the seas (he who controls Davy Jones' heart controls something called the Kracken, a mythological beast ...more on that in a minute) and thus be the only trading ships on the ocean. But Will Turner also needs the heart in order to save Elizabeth from the deadly clutches of Beckett who has promised to hang both Will and Elizabeth if he doesn't get it. The race is afoot! And what a race it is! As far as summertime blockbusters go, you'd have a pretty tough time finding something as entertaining as Dead Man's Chest. The action is incredible, the dialogue fun, and the special effects first-rate. Johnny Depp, as always, inhabits the role of Jack Sparrow. His mannerisms, line delivery and antics are just a sheer joy to watch. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are also fun to watch but not nearly as much as Depp (who steals every scene he's in).<br/><br/>There are problems though (Argh!). Length is an obvious issue. At 2 and 1/2 hours, younger kids might find it a bit irritating to sit through something so long. Indeed, little youngsters should avoid the film altogether as it has some rather gruesome if not downright frightening scenes in it (gaining its full PG-13 rating by having images of eyeballs being plucked out of living and caged pirates, etc.) The other problems involve the meshing histories. A tenuous connection between Davy Jones and The Flying Dutchman can be made, of course (the true captain of the Flying Dutchman was NOT anyone named ""Davy Jones"" but the myth is adequate enough to have him helm the ship). The other issue is Davy Jones' mythological undersea monster, the Kracken. The Kracken is a beast related to Greek and Norwegian mythology, not something as current as Davy Jones (who's myth started, I believe, in the early 1700s). My only other movie experience with the Kracken was in the sad, sad, sad B-movie CLASH OF THE TITANS (maybe not a true B-movie, but it sure felt that way!) I will admit, however, that Dead Man's Chest got the creature's features down more appropriately according to legend.<br/><br/>At any rate, this is a wonderful summer film. Blockbuster? Definitely. Disney has done something amazing in their marketing, too: pulling stories from rides at their theme parks is a sure way to ensure that people come back to Disneyland and Disney World time and time again. Sheer genius."
"flutegirl-2","10","1","3","12 July 2006"," One of the best sequels I have ever seen
","Okay, first of all, I really enjoyed this movie, because the first movie is my favorite movie of all time. And because I have seen The Curse of the Black Pearl so many times, Dead Mans Chest was a thriller to me! There were a lot of returning jokes and quotes from the first, so if you want to see this movie, I would suggest you watch the Black Pearl before you do. Another thing about Dead Mans Chest that I liked was the special effects. The effects were wonderful, with the Krakken and the disappearing of ships. The really only thing that I did not like about the movie was that the ending left you hanging (lets hope that I'm not ruining it)."
"Hakkaida","10","1","3","12 July 2006"," Great Popcorn Flick!
","Now this is what summer films are all about! I loved the first one but I think I enjoyed this one even more. Johnny Depp was awesome as usual. The entire cast was great but Depp stood out. The special FX on this one were amazing, especially Davy Jones himself. I really loved how Davy Jones and his doomed crew began to take the form of various sea creatures like hammerhead sharks, crabs, etc. I love all the characters and this movie picks up right where the last one left off. It seemed to be a bit darker than the first one and may be a bit too scary for the really young ones. Still, I highly recommend this if you're looking for a fun popcorn flick. It ends with a real cliffhanger which leaves you begging for more. I can't wait for the third one!"
"karlvetter02","7","1","3","12 July 2006"," Movie wasn't that Great
","I thought the visual effects in this movie were spectacular and is a reason to see the movie by itself. However i felt the acting in this movie was below par and that the acting was better in the first one. I didn't believe the characters in a sense. I also feel like the writers of this movie took advantage of the viewers. Anyone who loved the first movie felt compelled to see this movie because they expect it will be just as good. However i think the writers realized the plot of the sequel wasn't as good so they found a way to ensure people will see the third one, the ending leaves you with too many questions and i feel this was wrong. I despise when a movie ends in a way you know another<br/><br/>sequel is coming, if it turns into a Jason and or Freddy series i will be annoyed, stop ruining the integrity of a good movie and rather then be lazy and milk a good movie, think of something new. Despite my dislike for certain aspects of this movie, i will see it again, simply because i love Davy Jones army/ship/Kraken. They were able to combine my joy of pirates/marine life/supernatural elements. So essentially i prefer the first one, the sequel could have been better and i await the FINAL one."

And now what's up with the redheaded captain coming back to life? I thought he died but this is Disney right? Funny thing, I went to Disneyland the day it reopened Pirates of the Caribbean Ride. Jack Sparrow is all over the place in there. They updated a lot inside but the lines were still only 30 minutes max to get in. They also had a great Jack Sparrow actor there to sign autographs and take pics with. Yes I voted a 10! It's still a great movie and I'll be seeing it again this weekend, ARRGGHH!!"
"NickSemenas","6","1","3","12 July 2006"," okay...
","I went and saw Pirates of the Caribbean: The Dead Man's Chest and I have to say that I was not that impressed. Personally, I never was the impressed with the first one. Depp, of course, scored big with his acting. I, however, was less than enthused by a few of the other big names in the film. I think I would probably like this movie better if it wasn't made with all of those one liners for the cheap laugh. Although, I am aware that that is part of a Captain Jack Sparrow's character. My last point is that I feel the ending of Dead Man's Chest was left way too open. I mean, come on, they might as well of just call it Dead Man's Chest part 1. They did not leave the first one that open. I think that was a disappointment to everyone in the theater."
"rossd2005","5","1","3","12 July 2006"," Not A Pirates Fan But Still...
","Okay, I wasn't looking forward to seeing this film. It was a combination of my hate for Orlando Bloom's acting, the hate I've had for years of the Pirates Of The Caribbean Ride at Disneyland, and how bad the first one was. This film is very slow and it didn't excite me too much. But don't take my word for it because for those of you who enjoyed the first one, this sequel is the kind of sequel that blows you away much further than the first one (a good example includes Batman Returns). The action scenes are pretty impressive, the tribal scene is a little exciting but at this time the film is still nothing special. The thing that brought this film up from a 2/10 to a 5/10 for me is the final 45 minutes, the action scenes are phenomenal leaving me with a feeling like 'Why couldn't the rest of the film be like this' So for those of you who enjoyed the first film, go see it, but for those of you who didn't but do like good action borrow it off a friend when the DVD's released and watch the final 45mins"

And really its only half a movie. I knew they were shooting it like LOTR but i didn't know the sequels were gonna be like that. If you haven't seen the movie you will be shocked at the cliffhanger ending. The only complaints i could give is the it leaves u asking too many questions without answers.

","Well what can I say that hasn't already been said. I will point out the movie was even better than the first one in my opinion, which i loved by the way. <br/><br/>*SPOILERS POSSIBLY AHEAD*<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth reprise there roles in this movie and offer some of the stuff that there known for and a few new twists each. especially with Elizabeth acting more ""pirate"" like in this film than the first. The movie starts with Will and Elizabeth getting arrested for helping Jack in piracy, and Will is offered one way to save themselves, get Jacks broken compass. In the meantime Jack gets a visit from ""bootstrap"" Bill Turner that Davy Jones is coming from him. So As Jack always does, he runs from his problems and goes to taratuga. This sets up a great action ride, the best I have seen in years. Like all blockbusters there's a few flaws here and there but nothing to ruin the fun. The KRAKEN stills the movie, and gives some great scenes. Bill Knightly is sooooo great as Davy Jones. You might remember him from ""underworld"" as ""victor."" I'll leave the rest of the movie in your hands, you just really need to see this movie, you wont be disappointed."

Having already broken box offices records, this is a worthy sequel to the original film, with all the favourite characters showing up again, and even some brilliant new ones.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy as the evil Davy Jones is pinpoint perfect casting and plays the part very well, considering a lot of it was cgi with his costume.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen the film, what are you waiting for.

","I saw the movie just yesterday. I think the special effects were very very good and they did a great job with all the action scenes. What i didn't like about it is that they never really seemed to finish one objective before starting another. Also it seemed to be a lot longer than it really had to be. But that also be a good or bad thing depending on the person. But it didn't take too much away from the overall effect of the movie. Everyone loves Jonny Depp and Orlando Bloom in their characters and thats one of the reasons the movie was such a big hit. So in the end i think it was a great success and i cant wait for the 3rd one!"
"mike_rocko","6","1","3","11 July 2006"," Not much closure but still a wild ride...
","As far as sequels go, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men's Chest is awesome. It is a step below the first Pirates, but that is just because the first Pirates compares with the Star Wars trilogy and the Indiana Jones trilogy.<br/><br/>Do I think that the third movie will be incredible? No doubt. The first two movies were wild rides but I think people liked the first one more (myself included) because it had a lot of closure. I don't think I could have found it possible to leave the original movie without a smile on my face. Sparrow gets his ship, Turner gets the girl, and people realize that it IS possible to be a pirate and be a good man.<br/><br/>The second movie doesn't have the same kind of closure that the first had. We don't really know Jack's fate, we are questioning whether or not who loves/lusts who, and it's blatantly obvious they are setting up a second movie. As if anyone who is a fan at all didn't know they were filming two movies at the same time, but still.<br/><br/>The third movie will have the same kind of closure the first one did and undoubtedly will be an incredible ride. Two genuine bad guys in Davey Jones and Captain Barbosa, we find out Elizabeth and Will's intentions, and of course Johnny Depp will undoubtedly be back as the legendary Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>That said, Dead Man's Chest is a GREAT movie with the kind of action and plot development that has me anticipating next May with beated breath."
"DKosty123","9","1","3","11 July 2006"," Best Family Film of 2006 -Swash Buckling Fun!
","This film has it all. The first film in the series was held together by Johnny Depp. This film has fine performances from the entire cast and great scenery, special effects, & fabulous action sequences. Keira Knightly is very good as the female lead trying to marry Orlando Bloom's character who seems to be tied to Captain Jack Sparrow. In this film, these folks are given some good script to work with outside of their interaction with Sparrow. That is what makes the film better than the Curce of The Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Yes, this film is long, but even though I was tired when I saw it, I dare you to sleep through it. The plot is too good & the action scenes too good to sleep through. The legends of the sea are used in this one, from Davy Jones Locker to the Flying Dutchman, the images are all richly there. The search for the key to this movie is very entertaining indeed. The action is great, the comedy is great, & I promise you can't sleep through it. This is like riding your favorite roller coaster.<br/><br/>Because of the fact there is more action, more balanced acting, more locations, more of everything than the first film, Johnny Depp's performance does not stand out as much in this one as it did in the first one (which is an Oscar Depp deserved more than the person who won it, um what's their name?). Never fear though, Captain Jack Sparrow is still plenty here & does dominate enough scenes to make everyone happy. <br/><br/>You will find this film a real pleasure to watch & it is the best family film of 2006, without a doubt."

When I first heard that Bill Nighy was taking the role of Davy Jones, I wondered if he could fill these boots, but he proceeded to do so very well and created yet another popular character from an excellent film. The storyline was gripping and the many surprises had me shocked throughout the entire film. I cannot rap up this comment without giving praise to the outstanding performance given by Johnny Depp, he recreated Jack Sparrow with more humour and cunning than the first film, much to my delight. And may I say he continues to make me drool with his stunning good looks. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly also give amazing performances, though I slightly hate Keira/Elizabeth now for her actions, but if you haven't watched the movie yet then I won't spoil the surprise.

"vespa724","Null","1","3","11 July 2006"," what happened
","i was excited to see this sequel since the first teaser trailers were released. when it came out and i heard some negative comments about it i assumed that these people were not into the fist one. admittedly i was skeptical of the first one too (being a childhood fan of the ride at Disneyland, i didn't know what to make of a feature length brockheimmer sp? movie based on it). but was indeed charmed by Depps performance and the over all production of the movie. So i had high hopes for this sequel. Although sequels are often spell disaster, it seemed this one would be like spiderman II or x-men II. <br/><br/>When i watched Pirates II I was frustrated by two aspects. One, the decidedly dark overtones that throw our main characters into a love triangle. Two, the fact this movie relays so heavily on a third installment. The first movie i think succeeded because because it ran with a rather fantastic premise and was self referential enough that you actual become comfortable with the movie and just enjoy the adventure; which wraps itself up by the end. <br/><br/>i did enjoy this movie, but felt that it hurt itself by losing the lighter elements and concise plot line of the first movie."
"sxyblnd2002","3","1","3","11 July 2006"," Not nearly as good as the first
","I just did not like this movie. First of all its at least 45 minutes too long. Jack Sparrow was so comical in the first pirates. Now he is over the top with the foppishness. They made him a caricature of a man, previously he was clever, manly and somewhat heroic, now he seems like a coward. Yes, he comes back to ""save"" the crew, but, for the rest of the movie he is cowering. The sword fight on the island was just too over the top. Jack again was running away for most of the ""fight"". They didn't use Johnny Depp to the best of his potential. The clips I saw before seeing the movie were the only things funny in the entire movie. The rest of the movie was just like a special effect smorgasbord. It was almost a science fiction feature with the giant octopus Kraken. I was more into the story and the comedy in the first one, the second one was all about the effects. Elizabeth Swan, boring as always, now all of a sudden knows how to fight like an expert swordsman. Yes, the movie says that Will taught her how, but wow. How long were they engaged? I am guessing a few months, to learn how to fight this well would truly take years of training. She learned how to fight expertly in an amazingly short time. And the over acting when they were on the island. She was screaming like a banshee and then keels over from the heat (tongue in cheek) to get the other three to stop fighting. I'm sorry, but this woman has no comedic timing...it was overplayed and just looked ridiculous. It could have been better had the pirates stopped for a second, looked over at her, and then continued fighting. As it was, it just seemed like she was in her own little world having some kind of fit and nobody even noticed. The movie had way too much of wooden, boring Orlando Bloom. They made him the hero, the clever one, whereas in the first, it was Johnny Depp. The lady in the swamp. I liked her very much WHEN I could understand what she was saying. An authentic accent is great, but it detracts when you can't decipher it. I had such high hopes for this movie, and I really didn't like it at all. I bought my tickets in advance so I could see it immediately. Now I wish I would have waited. My daughter, brother, and fiancée all agree with this assessment. I will wait to read some viewer reviews before seeing Pirates of the Caribbean 3. No need to waste money when it will be on HBO in two months. I know this film has started filming already, but writers please...less of Elizabeth and Will...and more of a heroic, manly strong and funny Jack Sparrow!!!!!"
"shanepang","5","1","3","11 July 2006"," Not very good
","This film was overly long, tiring, and ugly. No plot lines were resolved in any way, and though this bodes well for a third film it leaves the second at a loss. There are too many characters and too little interaction between them. The film is choppy and poorly paced. Action sequences seem cut at random. <br/><br/>I wouldn't care too much, but this film had the biggest opening weekend of all time. Sure blockbusters don't have to be good cinema, but this film was bad.<br/><br/>I understand that they've already made a third. More power to them, but I hope that the hype dies down. The critical view of this film is fairly poor. The word of mouth should be the same. It seems like a film that makes 130 million in its opening weekend should be accountable for at least a minimum of quality."

The content within that chest happens to tell the sad story of one Davey Jones and his lost lady of the sea. But in order for Jack to get to the heart of things, so to speak, he must enlist the unwilling help of both Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner, yet again.

","This movie was disappointing in my mind, I mean a movie that is 2 and a half hours with no ending, is a weak movie to me. I thought the first one was better because at least it ended, and was not changing scenarios every 3 minutes throughout the movie. There are about 4 unfinished stories in Dead Man's chest that are displeasing for none of them show what happens. These consist of Will Turner's(Orlando Bloom) dad not showing what happens to him, or how he saves him. What happens to the beating heart, the reason for the captain coming back at the end. And also the way they close a 2.5 hour movie with a weak ending, leading to the third movie, and completing no stories at all. So all these stories will have to be picked up in the next one. Who wants to wait 2 years for that. I also thought things were unexplained such as the random psychic girl that lived in the middle of nowhere. And the game that Will Turner plays with his dad and the tentacles guy, Davie Jones, made no sense at all. And also something i found odd was when the tentacles guy, who controlled the sea or whatever, doesn't just transport everywhere. In a scene where Jack Sparrow is using a telescope to see the ship, the tentacles guy just transports to where he is standing. So why doesn't he always do that? This movie was just over the edge unrealistic, and the one liners every 2 minutes were awful."

","The first one was good because it was original to some degree, The second one however lacks so much, being two and a half hours long. I first walked into the cinema thinking that it would give me some entertainment though i was dead wrong. Walking into the picture i felt fine though after about the first half of the movie and being so unattached from it i started to get a headache from the pointless action.<br/><br/>The visual effects are quite good though the main problem with the movie is that there is no storyline or developing of the characters relationships what so ever.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp portrays a fantastic performance as jack sparrow, though all of his sayings were just conveyed over from the original movie and slightly changed making them very dull.<br/><br/>Spoiler warning , ...<br/><br/>It seems that some one just wanted to add a mystical undersea Kraken beast into the gist of the story. They also could not think of a better way of keeping the audience slightly intrigued so they put it in half way through the movie, not allowing for a climax trying to drag it on for 2 and a half hours which is just stupid. In the end though u find that the characters have no relationships with each other and have not developed what so ever and they also continue the stupid joke about burning rum which was finished in the first movie, yet they repeated it numerous amounts of times.<br/><br/>The finale of Jack Sparrow getting eaten by the Kraken is just pointless and didn't need to occur. The movie also has aspects that come out of no where and do not happen again through out the story. At the beginning the movie can be seen as being more gruesome with crows picking out the eyes of prisoners though this is not continued and yet again pointless because it would increase the parental rating. An aspect to why the first one is so much better is that it allowed the audience to see the characters develop. Though this one lacked it immensely and the ending of wanting to continue the story made you think why?, its just so pointless.<br/><br/>The movie lacks so much that the fist one did, mainly due to it giving me a headache due to the pointless action and unattached i give it a 5, i would have given it less but Johnny Depp's performance saved it and is probably why people would still like it so much.Though due to no character development what so ever and pointless action it made it a bad sequel not dealing with matters that would have allowed it to soar."

","I only saw this movie last night, and came home feeling proud of Disney. The film, although starting off slow, was a great thrill ride from beginning to end. Davy Jones and his crew looked extremely realistic, and the Kraken was pulled off believably. The movie was not as 'jolly' as 'Pirates 1', as it took a darker look at Piracy and most of the film was shot in dark places. The only two things that let the film down were the accents of Tia Dalma and Davy Jones, and at one point, Bootstrap Bill Turner. The only reason I understood the plot was because I had read it on the internet. The other thing was the quickness of the scene where Jack was eaten by the Kraken. It went way too fast! But enough of my ranting! Apart from the complaints above, this movie was a pleasure to watch, and leaves you hungry for more. Disney ended the film with a GREAT cliffhanger, very similar too the effect of 'Prince of Persia: Warrior Within' and 'Halo 2', and it leaves you wanting to see the movie again and again! Can't wait for 'At World's End'! It's gonna rock! <br/><br/>Captain Jack REALLY IS Back!"

I found myself not caring at all how they ended - just wanting them to END. There wasn't a clear climax in this movie and neither my fiancé or myself cared how it was going to end. <br/><br/>The only cool part of this movie was the character of Davy Jones and the rest of his Flying Dutchman crew - the half human/half sea beasts.

","I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean 2 today and I was very disappointed. Before I went to see the movie I had read a few of the other reviews and I was very eager to see it. I agree with something written by author Jozxyqk in that the end of the film does make you think ""what the hell"" but for an entirely different reason. My reason for thinking ""what the hell"" is what the hell did I just see. One reason for my thought is Barbossa definitely died in the first movie and now he is fully alive without a single trace of the bullet wound in the heart he received in the first movie. This movie does not come close to being better or even as good as the first movie was. I left the theater with two things disappointment and a headache. Not to entirely complain about the movie it does have a few good parts and jokes like Captain Jack Sparrow repeatedly shooting Jack the monkey. The effects are incredible and the acting is very good. I recommend that you see this movie in the theater first, that way if you hate it you are not stuck with it."

","This film was nowhere near as good as the first, but rarely does the sequel surpass the first. This was the second in three films so it set up the third while continuing the story.<br/><br/>The basic plot is that Will Turner and his bride to be Elizabeth Swann are arrested for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow's escape. Turner is promised a way to save his beloved if he retrieves a compass from Sparrow. This sets of a series of adventures and back-stabbings that no one could predict, with a stunning climax that will leave movie goers stunned.<br/><br/>My only problems with this film were the sexing up of Elizabeth. She shoved her boobs in the face of anyone who would look and practically threw herself @ Jack on the Pearl, while continuing to profess love for Will. My other complaint was the change in the characters interactions. Jack was very protective of Will in the first film and in this one, it appears he is selling him out, but not all is ever as it seems. Will is whiny and bratty, and spends the majority of the film complaining. However, he remembers his bravery later.<br/><br/>This is a lot like Empire Strikes Back, where it sets up a chain of events that makes things look bleak for our heroes. I am eagerly anticipating the third installment."

Johnny Depp is amazing in it and Jack Davenport does a bang-up job, but until about 40 minutes from the end (of a 149 minute film!) the plot has little discernible continuity, and jumps from one storyline to another WAY too much to hold much concentration.<br/><br/>It definitely pulls together at the end, leaving hope for a promising 3rd film, only to be almost completely ruined by a completely god awful slow-motion shot of Jack Sparrow..<br/><br/>Certainly worth seeing, but don't get too excited.

","As a big fan of the original flick I have been waiting sometime for Dead Man's Chest to come out, but was disappointed when I heard of some of the negative reviews. After viewing Dead Man's Chest yesterday I can understand what critics were saying. The first ""Pirates"" was an exciting fast paced ride and featured strong performances from all of the lead actors. However, this installment of ""Pirates"" is pretty much all special effects and nonstop action with little attention paid to the actual plot. It seems as if the director had no real storyline planned and just strung together a series of exciting scenes loosely connected by weak dialogue. The cast's talents are wasted: Jack's performance feels half-hearted, Will Turner barely comes across as our hero, and Elizabeth's scenes feel like an afterthought. Their screen magic that made the first movie a success is replaced here for multimillion dollar computer generated technology. Overstaged by special effects, Davy Jones isn't close to the same villain as Rush's Barbossa. Not to mention there were only half the amount of laughs. All in all, this film (which at 150 minutes plus 40 minutes of previews is just way too long) feels like it will only act as a wobbly bridge to connect the first and third film -- and I hope they take more care with storyline in the final installment. While Depp was nominated for an Oscar for his work in the The Curse of the Black Pearl, I see no academy nods in store for this summer popcorn flick."
"mosestheliar","6","1","3","10 July 2006"," Great movie, Not a Great sequel
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was filled with action out the wazoo. The CGI was fantastic, the ships and over all feel of the era was clear, the story however, took a wrong turn. In comparison to the first installment to the now Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, the movie feel episodic and epic. It had story and character development and everything flowed smoothly. The Curse of the Black Pearl was amazing when it came out and still is to this day. <br/><br/>The main problem that I found with Dead Man's Chest was that the story seemed to drag on, only trying to keep the audience interested with special effects, versus story plot. The characters, minus Jack Sparrow, have all evolved into something completely different from before. They don't act the same, and really don't feel the same. Not to give out any spoilers but Elizabeth's character was the one that upset me the most. You will have to see the movie to understand what I am talking about. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it was a fantatsic movie, but I wanted to see a franchise built out of this, not a trilogy, the world has enough of those already. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is worth seeing, just don't expect a great sequel."
"mcschnoor","7","1","3","10 July 2006"," Passable; some flaws--but full of action.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is, at times, a frustrating tangle of plots, characters, side trips, and illusions. Yet, in the next instant, the action is rolling along once again, the exposition is clear, and the audience is engaged once again. It's a little disappointing, to be sure, in that it doesn't have a ""proper"" ending--but wasn't that the whole point? Didn't we know that both 2 and 3 were being shot simultaneously, and that, as is common with the middle portion of a trilogy (Lotr, SW, etc.) there would be a cliffhanger? The ending was not what bothered me.<br/><br/>The storyline was.<br/><br/>OK, plot thread one: Davy Jones, denied by his true love and driven to madness, makes a pact with the devil to gain immortality as, essentially, the spirit of the sea--changeable, terrifying, and cruel. He is searching for Jack Sparrow because Jack also made a pact with Davy Jones in order to be captain of the Black Pearl. So, Jack runs away, as he is apt to do, and twists others around for his own benefit.<br/><br/>Plot thread two: Will and Elizabeth are arrested on their wedding day on the charges of aiding and abetting Jack Sparrow. The ""Evil"" Lord Cutler Beckett (Played to perfect evilness by Tom Hollander) of the East India Trading Company convinces Will to search for Jack's compass in exchange for a pardon. Will leaves for Tortuga; Elizabeth, released from prison by her father, dresses as a boy and stows away on a ship. They both encounter Jack, who convinces them, separately, to look for what he wants most.<br/><br/>Plot thread three: (Still with me?) What does Jack want? Legend says that Davy Jones took a knife and cut out his own heart so he wouldn't feel the pain of losing his true love. He put the heart in a chest and the lock on his person. Jack wants them, Will and Elizabeth want them because Jack does, and because he'll give them the compass in exchange... And a few other people want them, too.<br/><br/>Now, this chunk, by itself, is enough for a movie. But, for some strange reason, the director (or maybe it was the editor) added in a completely pointless diversion, early on in the film, regarding a tribe of cannibals. It's entertaining but wholly pointless. It's 20 minutes of Depp getting to mince about like a drunk gay gerbil, which is entertaining, but pointless, especially when that time could have been used to, you know, explain the rest of the plot! Much has been said about the actors in this film. Honestly, while I enjoyed Depp's performance as much as the previous film, I found it just on this side of annoying for some scenes. The writers put in too many little Jack-talks-fast-and-uses-big-words-to-confuse-people oh-he's-really-such-a-nice-guy moments. Knightly was good as Elizabeth, and had a really good moment of conflict when, at the end, she takes matters into her own hands in an unexpected and mature way. Bloom was better than the first film, in my opinion. He can carry the film (And I'm not one of his legion of tween fans, so, take it for what you will.) and he does very well in many scenes.<br/><br/>Hollander, as the greedy Lord Beckett, looked like he was enjoying himself with his part, as did Stellan Skarsgard, playing Will's father with empathy, spirit, and deep, unexpected love.<br/><br/>All in all, a good film which needed a better editor."

","*WARNING! Major spoilers.* I loved this movie, but also hated it at the same time. For pretty much every good thing there was a bad thing. And I would also like to mention that I am a 16-year-old girl--and because of this, Johnny Depp in this movie is hot, and Bootstrap Bill and Davy Jones' Clan are pretty disgusting looking. Now that that's said and done...<br/><br/>Good: The jokes were great, I loved the continuance of the rum jokes and the Captain Jack Fruit Kabob sequence. I thought they were pretty clever, good timing, all that fun stuff. The waterwheel sequence was visually exciting (and comedic at times), and the swordfights were great--maybe even better than the first film's.<br/><br/>Bad: In my opinion, the plot was sort of boring and repetitive. Did the Kraken *really* have to attack the Black Pearl like, three times? (Okay, it might have been two, but still.) Once would have been enough, especially since we had already seen the effects of the Kraken on the other ship. And am I the only one who thought the Kraken was sort of...unexciting? Honestly, it should have been more than a giant squid-plant. I understand the necessary continuance between Davy Jones(aka Squidface) and the Kraken (aka Squidplant), but it should have been more than a transition from face to plant. Get rid of the squids and what are you left with? Faceplant..which is what the lack of anything more in-depth makes me want to do. (Permanently plant my face to the wall...for anyone who missed that.) And of course, the last thing that was bad about the movie? The ending. I'm known amongst my friends to be among the last to understand things, but *I* thought Barbossa was dead; or at least, we were led to believe so. I don't know anyone who has survived a gunshot wound to the chest, but that's just me... And, of course, the fact that we have to wait a year on the last millimeter of our seats.<br/><br/>Overall, I give it a 7 out of 10. What can I say, I'm a big fan of random comedy."

","I recently saw this movie with my friend and her family and these are my only thoughts of it: 1) It was very cliché. I honestly wish so much that Disney hadn't made this movie because if it had been made by say Warner Bros. it may have been better and far less typical. This is the one thing I have always noticed about Disney movies, all my life. They are all very cliché and typical (by typical I mean the typical plot line or the typical ending or the typical romance...etc) they have no substance to them all they are is love scenes and victory, I have not once seen Disney even attempt to create a movie that actually has something to do with the way REAL life works. The first was far better. Too much affection in the movie to be called ""Disney."" Disney should be ashamed. And many people probably wanted to push that bimbo off deck.<br/><br/>& 2) It seemed to drag on forever, it was incredibly long to me. And when it finally ended it didn't even really end.<br/><br/>This is definitely not the best movie I've ever seen but definitely not the worst either. I hope that they do a better job with the next one."

"aharmas","7","1","3","9 July 2006"," Faster than a speeding... wheel?
","150 minutes? One word of advice for the producers of this series: please invest a few more days and tighten the editing, and you'll have in your hands a classic. Somewhere in between some pretty bloated dialog lies a very good action film. Other than that, we have a worthy sequel to a film that had a few problems establishing the premise behind creating an exciting tale of pirates versus pirate ghosts? I am still not sure.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the main cast is back, and Johnny Depp is still a marvelous Captain Sparrow, a unique character whose true nature and motivations remain as murky as the reasons behind his choice of eye makeup. In this segment, our heroes are out looking for a chest that contains a very valuable and essential ""part"" that will empower his possessor with absolute power over the Pirates universe. Such is the prize that we everyone literally scrambling to secure the key, the chest, and the object. During the last 45 minutes, the action pieces are integrated so seamlessly, the action and the comedy become one. It is probably the one section of the film that Depp manages not to upstage because every other element in the film, as it should, matches the intensity of his acting.<br/><br/>Talking about Depp's reduced time this out is particularly irksome to this member of the audience because it is his pirate creation that lifts this series above other adventures of the fantastic pirate mythology. Depp's sense of humor and ambiguous characterization make the character quite enjoyable and puzzling in an admiring way. It is fun to see a guy who has no problems making the most outrageous deals in order to get what he needs or wants. It is a pity that the producers and the directors didn't think it was important to keep him on screen longer periods of time. Imagine seeing an Indiana Jones movies with 10 minutes of Harrison Ford. We go to ""Pirates"" to see Johnny. It is his magnetic star persona that makes the experience quite special.<br/><br/>However, it must be recognized that the film is exquisitely photographed and both special effects and real life photography blend quite well. Much work has gone into designing some very impressive make up work for the new batch of bad guys, and the centerpiece of the film has us in awe of an octopus like creature that lives up to what one expects of a horrifying and powerful entity.<br/><br/>It is a bit unnerving and mystifying that we end up with a cliffhanger after such a long film, but maybe it is all a set up for a more exciting and better conclusion. After all Johnny will be back, and we know he certainly delivers."
"hollywoodgirl-1","10","1","3","9 July 2006"," Blew Me Away
","The first time I saw this movie, I was forced to sit in the front row (don't ask). I could only take in bits and pieces of it and because of that I thought it was slow and I was disappointed. However, I went again today and was able to sit near the top and take in the whole movie at the same time. I was truly amazed. Granted, there are many plot elements that are never explained and do not make sense. There are many that come from seemingly nowhere and you wish that you knew what they were about. However, all of these moments fit together wonderfully to create a truly worthy sequel to the first Pirates. The tone to this movie is decidedly darker than the first. Bill Nighy plays Davy Jones, the heartbroken (literally) lord of the sea underworld who commands a ship full of ghost pirates that look like the stuff nightmares are made of. For anyone who was creeped out by Captain Barbossa in the first Pirates, Davy Jones makes him look like Pooh Bear. There are sequences in the movie that carry the more lighthearted tone of the first, such as the crew trying to swing to the sides of the cliff in their cages and the epic swordfight atop the water wheel. Johnny Depp is truly in his element as Jack Sparrow, making him even more wacky and hilarious than usual. Orlando Bloom steps back into Will Turner and is given much more to do. Will has done some growing up and it shows. Keira Knightley once again plays the feisty Elizabeth Swann. She is also given much more to do and does a lot with it. She is no longer the helpless damsel in distress, she manages to keep herself out of trouble and out of captivity on pirate ships. I was especially amazed at Tom Hollander, who plays the land villain Lord Cutler Beckett. I loved him as Mr. Collins in Pride and Prejudice and was delighted to see him and Keira working together again. As a die-hard Pirates fan (I saw the first one six times in the theater), I went into this movie with very high expectations. It didn't meet them, however. It more than exceeded them."
"aliporace","9","1","3","9 July 2006"," An exciting adventure from start to finish
","I may be a 14 year old girl going to see a movie about Johnny Depp, but that is most certainly not the only reason this movie was absolutely amazing to me. The first Pirates was my favorite movie since I saw it, and when I heard there was a sequel, I must admit I was a bit nervous about what they could possibly do without Geoffrey Rush's ingenious character of Captain Barbossa. I was definitely impressed with how they managed to carry on a story that even compared to the first.<br/><br/>The effects in this film were wild. I am still trying to figure out how in God's name they created Davey Jones and crew. All of the stunts are also impressive. Although it is difficult to come close to the Sparrow/Barbossa sword fight in the cave in the first film, the three-way fight between Depp, Davenport and Bloom certainly comes close.<br/><br/>Of course Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow entertains all with his witty one-liners and way about him in which you can never tell whether he is drunk or a genius. He also has a sex-appeal that has ladies in theaters swooning over him. He is without-a-doubt what makes a hit out of these movies. Although he does more than sit back and look pretty in this movie I am still far from impressed with Orlando Bloom and his character. It seems as if Bloom tries getting by on his good looks a lot and doesn't get deep into the character. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann is much more entertaining than last time. Although she was absolutely gorgeous from start to finish in the first Pirates, her character is much more interesting in this film. Even though I believe she is one of the worst sword fighters in the movie, I do like the direction her character is headed in, and i can do nothing but wish her luck with the three men pursuing her. Jack Davenport does much more in the film as well. Although he is becoming more of a villain and he played a great commodore in the first film, he plays this role well too. Bill Nighy plays a superb Davy Jones. It would be easy to sit back and let the special effects and costume play this role, but Nighy creates an intimidating, clever villain. Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook are a hilarious addition to this crew. I was surprised by their return, but also very happy seeing as i liked their characters even when they were the ""bad guys"". They are a perfect duo and, although they are with a new crew, they didn't manage to lose their pirate, get what they want attitudes that they have. Stellan Skarsgård plays an excellent Bootstrap Bill. His costume is amazing, and he doesn't hide behind it. Tom Hollander aggravated all with his Cutler Beckett. Not that he played it badly. That is how you should feel about the man he is. He is meant to play the man that gets in the way of the ""good guys"". Tia Dalma was played by Naomi Harris. She played the creepy, voo-doo, medicine woman she was supposed to be. Although sometimes the accent made her seem a bit over the top, I liked the character.<br/><br/>SPOILER!!!!!<br/><br/>One last character I have mentioned earlier , but should mention again is Geoffrey Rush's Captain Barbossa. He is without a doubt my second favorite character in these movies. I was a bit disappointed when I saw him die in the first movie. This may seem a bit long for him having one line in the movie, but now I have such high hopes for the second movie. Rush delivers every single line so perfectly, and I find myself getting goosebumps when he delivers his lines or winds up in a sword fight. The surprise of Barbossa showing up followed by the final line at the end was incredible and one of the greatest, yet most frustrating endings I have seen in a long time. <br/><br/>You need to see this movie in theaters to get the effect and experience of the fantastic movie this is. If you are as great a fan as I am, you will be frustrated by the end, dying as you wait another year for the third film to come out and conclude things, and smiling at the magic the movie created."

However, not all of it is bad; the acting was great, for the most part, and the special effects were top-notch.<br/><br/>It is important to view this film and the upcoming movie as one. As a story, the movie does a good job of setting us up for what is going to happen in the third film. However, as a stand-alone movie, I don't think this movie is as good as others are saying. I remember watching a half-hour in thinking that the movie would get better. It didn't. Mindless action sequences (and some were downright stupid; the prisoners inside the bone-cages reminded me of human hamsters on wheels) did nothing to help this film, and there was very little plot development--at least not enough for my tastes, considering the length of the film.<br/><br/>However, I am going to refrain from passing final judgment on this film until I see the third movie. If the purpose of the movie was to build up the plot for the series's climax, then Pirates 2 did an excellent job. I think my problem was that I went in with higher expectations than I should; contrary to what others are saying, this movie in no way equals the first.

Johnny Depp's performance is flawless (as it always is) as Jack Sparrow. My only lament is that I wanted to see more of him. Orlando Bloom seems more at home in his character this time around, and hooray to the writers and director for giving my love, Dirty Naughty Norrington, more development and screen time (I would go to see a movie just about him; can you tell I love Jack Davenport). Bill Nighy is stupendous as Davy Jones; movie fans will appreciate the fact that under all of the CGI tentacles, the actor shines through in both his voice and his mannerisms. The only performance that was lack luster for me was Keira Knightley. I usually enjoy Keira's performances, but Elizabeth Swann seems to be, at times, in the way of the male cast and their action sequences. However, she more than makes up for this lack of spark in her scenes with Jack Sparrow. The chemistry in the banter between the two is edgy and entertaining.<br/><br/>All in all, this film is a multiple must see for all land lubbers who dream of the sea. (A friend of mine saw it twice within a 24 hour period, if that is any indication of the quality of this film.) A year is too long a wait for the third installment."

I don't know who is writing these ""professional"" reviews or who payed them to write a poor one, but this movie is great.<br/><br/>And if your the type of person who hates most movies you see, then this movie will be ""good."" Either way, if you haven't seen it, GO! You will not regret it."

","know i'm the first to admit that this film is no way as good as the first. Although i thoroughly enjoyed partly because i love swashbucklers no matter how bad they are(except from cutthroat island)i enjoy them.I think most people will just be expecting too much from the sequel.Even though it's a sequel it's a really different and more grown up film than the first.It's a more darker story and we get to see more character development for our main characters, coupled with amazing effects and great monsters it makes for an exciting watch.Main complaint from would be that it's too long. It's a hard one to comment on people will love it or hate it.Me i loved it <br/><br/>one eyed Willy <br/><br/>aaaaarrrrrrr!!!!"
"thomasintc","8","1","3","9 July 2006"," if you like self contained movies, you won't like this one but if...
","I enjoyed the first movie and equally enjoyed this second version. However, if you prefer movies that wrap up every detail into a nice finished ending you won't enjoy it. What we get is plenty of Jack doing what he does best, supporting characters doing what they do best and fun humor that sometimes takes a second or two to set in. The movie never takes itself seriously and that was what I enjoyed about the first one. Movies don't have to be perfect critically acclaimed academy award nominees to be enjoyable and this is where ""Dead Man's Chest"" figures in. The opening scene is brilliant and the closing scene makes me impatient for the next installment. Great Special Effects, truly capitalized upon action scenes and the occasional recurring joke just plays upon the first movie."
"aboomer26","10","1","3","8 July 2006"," Was So Impressed!
","Like many fans of the first movie, I was afraid that trying to make an incredible film into a trilogy, albeit with the same cast and crew, would be a mistake. However, I was far from disappointed; this movie has everything that made ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" great and then some. Action-packed, dramatic and hilarious, with truly flawless CGI, this movie, although it is a sequel, is one that you will want to watch again and again. I had read Entertainment Weekly's depressing and pessimistic D+ review before seeing the movie, but I promise that those criticisms were completely unwarranted. No one who goes to see this movie with a desire to be entertained will come away unsatisfied; on the contrary, you will be screaming for more, and clenching your arm rests in anticipation of the next movie."
"gamersradio","6","1","3","8 July 2006"," Not what I was suspecting
","After watching the first Pirates movie a couple years back I was psyched to see a repeat on screen this summer. As a film maker I take into consideration all sorts of things that many other movie goers might not really think about too heavily such as lighting, editing, CGI, writing and plot development. The first Pirates movie had some of the best cinematography I have seen in recent years. Dead Man's Chest however didn't repeat it's spectacular art direction and cinematography seen in the first film. My biggest complaint was the CGI used for the main ""bad guys"". The CGI characters just weren't ""believable"". The textures were off, the lighting didn't match up, even the water for the opening sequence looked more like liquid metal than water to me. I noticed the same problems with the first Pirate movie, but this movie relied on CGI so much to carry it that it really ""sunk"" the movie (man I feel corny). <br/><br/>The writing was a big disappointment this time around. Either the actors didn't make it believable, or the writers were trying to push some new ideas too hard. To avoid spoiling the plot I'm going to redirect subjects... The overall length of the film left me anxious at the end to finally get it over with. The climax point comes and then you are left in your chair asking yourself ""what now""? Rather than dragging it out to finish off the story they leave you hanging for next year's Pirate release to finish the story from this release. It's the Matrix all over again! <br/><br/>Seeing how many kids were in the audience and taking into consideration that this is a Disney film I was surprised at how much suggested violence there is in this movie. There's one shot that pulls away just as a bunch of captives are about to be killed on their knees. Not something that I would complain about, but Disney usually doesn't let any content of this sort on their films (they usually re-brand it as Miramax or Touchstone)."
"ericakelly01","5","1","3","8 July 2006"," Failed To Impress
","I personally thought this sequel's hype was based solely on advertisement, and failed to live up to the former's glory. The movie was packed with redundant puns referring back to the first movie's treasured jokes, and to me, killed everything. However there were some great action scenes and a bit of a few laughs, but other than that, the media's 3 minute previews and merchandise held false promises about this film.<br/><br/>The only comforting thing was the cast - all original characters were present, and without them the directors' know they wouldn't be able to live it down. There are so many times in the movie where people seem a bit out of character, acting and speaking what didn't seem ""normal and original."" A cliffhanger awaits at the end, but isn't surprising since everyone knows about the filming of a third movie. I would still go see it, just to keep up with the storyline."
"cereneau","8","1","3","8 July 2006"," A great summer movie!
","Back in 2003, when we really needed a great summer movie to get things going, we got ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" a surprising gem of a movie whose magic and fun was only overshadowed by the performance of Johnny Depp and a deep fascination with the beauty of Keira Knightley. The movie pretty much came out of nowhere and took millions of unsuspecting moviegoers by surprise. I, myself, was so amazed by the movie that I went back two more times over the 2 1/2 months that it remained in my theater! So, needless to say, I'm a fan! When I heard that the sequel, ""Dead Man's Chest"" was on its way, I was undoubtedly excited.<br/><br/>Then I saw the trailer.<br/><br/>To me, the trailer made the movie seem like a hodgepodge of boring CG characters and bad acting from Orlando Bloom (""We have to go back for Jack...OK nevermind""). To say that I was disappointed would be a huge understatement. Furious and skeptical are, perhaps, better descriptors for the rage that consumed my soul. Despite this, I simply had to see the movie for myself, being a huge fan of everything the original movie had to offer.<br/><br/>The movie begins, by almost all accounts, poorly. We find good ol' Elizabeth and Will are to be married but are arrested for their involvement in the escape of Jack Sparrow (seen in the original). Will eventually strikes a deal with Cutler Beckett, the operator of the East India Trading Company in Port Royal to go after Captain Jack and bargain with him to return to ensure the safe release of Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Elizabeth escapes, herself, and leaves in pursuit of Will. Jack Sparrow, all the while, is being hunted by the notorious Davy Jones, with whom he has a debt to settle. This is essentially the plot of the story. Stated plainly in a few sentences, it actually takes the movie about 45 minutes to get to this point and this is why the first part of the movie is so dull. There is hardly any action for this period of time, and it's quite painful to sit through. Needless to say, I was regretting my decision to see the movie. However, when it finally picks up, it REALLY picks up.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with humor, just like the first, and Johnny Depp's performance is, once again, Oscar-quality (though the magic from the first film has worn off a little). There are numerous humorous references to the first movie, mostly about rum, which are funny at first but eventually wear a little thin. Additionally, most of the funny, quirky characters from the original have returned to serve as comic relief. It really is a fun, if not funny, movie.<br/><br/>additionally, the action sequences in ""Dead Man's Chest"" are top notch. Where as the first film essentially involved a lot of sword-fighting and cannon-firing, the writers of DMC rightly made sure to mix things up a little this time around. There are, of course sword fights and cannons (it is, after all, a pirate movie), but there are other circumstances that are happening simultaneously that keep things fun and interesting. Possibly the greatest addition to the action is the kraaken, a giant squid (or octopus. I'm not entirely familiar with the mythological beast.) When it's around, its one of the coolest CG monsters to ever grace the big screen, perhaps even topping those in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Additionally, the kraaken is truly creepy, almost frightening, as it engulfs ships like candy.<br/><br/>Another memorable newcomer is Davy Jones, played by Bill Nighy. When I saw the aforementioned trailer, Davy Jones looked ridiculous with his octopus beard. However, I must say that I was really impressed with his character. Nighy does a phenomenal job of making this otherwise plastic character seem utterly real and complex, and his performance is on the level of Depp's. Also, Bootstrap Bill, played by the always great Stellen Skarsgard, is another great character. As it turns out, Bootstrap, who we know died, is enslaved to work on Davy Jones' ship for an undisclosed amount of time. When he encounters his long-lost son, it really is a touching moment, and their relationship is really, at times, captivating. Additionally, the relationship between Will and Elizabeth is more interesting this time, as is the relationship between Elizabeth and Jack.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie is nothing more than a popcorn movie; a fun, big, exciting, phenomenal popcorn movie. Anyone going in to see an Oscar-caliber movie is probably going to be disappointed. Pirates of the Caribbean has never sought to be an epic movie like the Lord of the Rings, or other trilogies. It is simply a fun summer movie, one that you will undoubtedly enjoy for years and years to come.<br/><br/>Oh, and the aforementioned line in the trailer said by Will, it never actually happens. How about that?<br/><br/>Writing: 3 out of 5 Stars Directing: 4 out of 5 Stars Acting: 5 out of 5 Stars Overall: 4 out of 5 Stars"
"miyaswench","5","1","3","8 July 2006"," Another disappointing Disney sequel
","The movie was not terrible, but it was not great either. It was very disappointing after the first movie. It had no purpose but to lead up to the third movie. I didn't like how nothing was resolved; instead Disney added new things that could have been left out. The end sort of ruined the movie. I realize that they wanted to leave us hanging, but the way they could have done a much better job. I felt that they reached the climax and then instead of ending it, they started something almost completely new(should come at beginning of next movie). They could have done something else to provide some sort of conclusion and leave us hanging(the monkey scene at the end of the first movie). Also, the way they ended it will make it so that too much is happening in the next film; they will still be dealing with Davy Jones while they go on a new adventure to save Jack. I felt like I was watching the first half of a 5 hr. movie and now have to wait a yr. to see the rest. It felt like a waste of time watching a 2 1/2 hr. movie that only led up to the third one. Lastly, I did not like the new attraction between Jack and Elizabeth. I think it ruins things. On a more positive note, it was very humorous, although it may be frightening to young children."
"jdkraus","7","1","3","8 July 2006"," More 'in-depth' with the story, but lacked the 'pirates' feeling
","The first Pirates of the Carribbean was excellent. it had everything a swashbuckling film needed. i was looking for the same thing, if not better than the previous film. it was not what i expected (excellent). At my first screening it made no sense, but the second time around is always the better round. <br/><br/>So, the story goes that Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) owes a debt to the cursed Davy Jones, and thus becomes a marked man. he and his band of sailors must find a way out of the debt before he is eternally damned along with Jones' crew. meanwhile, Will (orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (keira Knightley) are on their way to be married, but are cut short when both of them are arrested for releasing Sparrow. In order to be free of charge, Will must obtain Jack's compass for a weasel named Lord Beckett for an unknown reason.<br/><br/>Yet again, Will and Elizabeth are sent on another misadventure with Jack. it sounds great. The story is much more in-depth, and answers a lot of questions from the first film, but it also left some questions that needed to be answered, unanswered. However, there is rather a difference with the film, due to how the story is chopped up, for the film drifts from one scene to another without clear explanations (I had to pay close attention even more so intently for the second round of seeing it). <br/><br/>Another difference in the film from the previous one was, was that it very dark. The first film had its sugar-coating humor that made it a popcorn-lovong film, but the 'sugarcoating' humor was absent in this film. it maybe a PG-13, but some images (I'm not a squeamish person) made me cringe a bit. The film had humor in it, but i have to say, it still lacked it. The film lost the whole 'pirates' feeling of humor that was what made the previous one fly. But, Johnny Depp still holds his charm (even though it wasn't enough), to hold things in order, as well as some other punchlines here and there. <br/><br/>I also have to admit that the film was rather slow, and dragged. But on more positive notes, the action sequences were amazing with eye popping visual effects that conquers over its prequel. And it was also nice to see some old faces from the prequel that were needed to keep the characters likable. there are new villains, and they were simply great. Bill Nighy played an excellent role as Davy Jones, and I look forward to seeing him in the next film. there was also some twists here and there too.<br/><br/>it was good, but not grand as the first. it is worth seeing, but not for the youngsters (there are some frightful images in it). it was good entertainment but it's not a great film like the first one. 4/5"
"tDiesel","9","1","3","8 July 2006"," Very Good
","This movie had me laughing the whole time, although not as good as the first storyline/character wise, this was a lot funnier. The twists were good and had me leaving the theatre excited.<br/><br/>Now that I'm done with the good part, here comes the bad.<br/><br/>The voodoo lady... i wanted to get up and rip her throat out, mainly because the 20 minutes of screen time she gets she talks, and through all that 20 minutes of talking i understood nothing. I know the accent is there to add some fun and authenticity to it, but I've had better luck receiving tech support from outsourced Indian employees.<br/><br/>Go watch it."
"bowles862","10","1","3","8 July 2006"," Dead Man's Chest
","Dead Man's Chest was excellent. I much preferred the sequel to the original. There was so much more to this film; humour, action and mild horror. Davy Jones was a better enemy than Captain Barbossa - he was an excellent, largely computer-generated character, whose name is already famously known through pirate folklore. The sea creature men were effectively replacements for the skeletons in the original film. The sea creature men were noticeably different from each other, which is a good thing as it gives the baddies much more visual impact. The awesome kraken was hugely impressive as well. The stunts throughout the film were well-staged and humorously over-the-top. This is Johnny Depp's best performance and I believe he deserves an Oscar this time, an award he was nominated for in the original film."
"hartkin","10","1","3","8 July 2006"," Absolutely Amazing
","I saw PotC2 last night when it first opened and the place was packed. I was expecting a movie that wasn't as good as the first, but I was so incredibly wrong. The movie was absolutely amazing. It was scary but hilarious at the same time. It kept the viewers laughing the whole way. The special affects were amazing and so real. The acting was incredible, especially from Johnny Depp (Captain Jack Sparrow) and Orlando Bloom (Will Turner) and Kiera Knightley (Elizabeth Swann). I will definitely go back to theaters to see it again, probably more than once. I will also buy it on DVD for sure. It's a great movie that you'll never grow tired of. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see a great summer movie."
"SnakeEclipse","10","1","3","8 July 2006"," Quite possibly turning out to be the greatest trilogy since the original Star Wars
","First off, Pirates 2 was miles ahead of the first one, and there are many reasons why. It had a darker story, which was more in depth and complicated than the first one, and probably will take more than one viewing to understand the entire plot. HOwever, everything was indeed taken to the next level in this one, as well as any sequel should.<br/><br/>(Spoilers) (majorly) There is more than one plot going on if you think about it. Because there's the issue of Jack fighting to keep his life, there's will and Elizabeth trying to ensure their freedom, and there's also Will trying to save his father's soul as well.<br/><br/>The characters are much more in depth in this one as well. Jack becomes a lot more noble at one point. Will is much less of a pansy in this one. Not that he was in the first, but he's a lot more bad ass this time around. Even Elizabeth brings a lot more edge to her character. The minor characters have much more comic relief to them in this movie, and there are also a lot more twists as well with plot and characters who you never even thought to come back.<br/><br/>The action sequences are twice as intense as well as the swordfights, and Davy Jones is a far more fearsome villain than Barbossa ever will be. Stellan Skaarsgard gives a great performance as Will's father as well.<br/><br/>As far as the comedic gags go. I felt that they were somewhat needed at times, especially with Jack's character as always, but even the other characters had quite a bit as well, which made it much more fun to watch.<br/><br/>Now, comparing this to the original trilogy of Star Wars. Look at Jack Sparrow. He reeks of Han Solo throughout the movie, albeit he's a lot more lax than Han, but he has the roguish, mercenary swagger that Han does. Will is basically Luke Skywalker, because he's the goody goody fighting for justice all the time, even though he's quite the pirate as well. Elizabeth is obviously Princess Leia, and the fact that her and Will are to be married is basically Luke and Leia without the brother sister plot involved. As for other characters. Barbossa can be compared best to Moff Tarkin in the first movie, cuz he is not the most fearsome villain in the seas, like Tarkin wasn't the most evil figure in the galaxy. Davy Jones is the evil emperor, and Will's father is like Anakin if he didn't get burned, but he still has done something he eventually is not proud of and does want to save his son, only it happens in #2 instead of #3. Gibbs can be compared to Yoda, cuz he's like a mentor to will at times. The two pirates (the fat guy and the one with the odd Eye) can be compared to R2 D2 and C3P0 in that order as well. The government and the undead could all be compared to the empire, just cuz they're the bad guys in the story. As far as plot goes, none of it has to really do with blowing up Death stars and stuff.<br/><br/>However, the first one did go a bit like the first one in a sense that Will is a farmboy (blacksmith) who meets up with Jack(Han Solo) and wants to save Elizabeth (Leia.) Only, no death star. Curse must be lifted instead.<br/><br/>In number 2 of Pirates, the plot had a lot more twists and turns, and a surprise at the end. The government and the undead are after the Pearl and Jack (Millenium Falcon and Solo) Will has to save his father, which is his goal by the 3rd movie, and finally, there is a HUGE twist as it ends, only no (Will, I am your father.) That's just how it seems to me, but not only that. If you think about it, times have changed again like they did back in the 70s when all those realistic movies came out and Star wars came along and changed everything. The new trilogy didn't do as well, and pray God Pirates doesn't do the same thing. Nowadays, in the world where there's all these remakes of classic movies that were sometimes better the first time around, Pirates comes along. It may be based on something already in existence, but the plot and the characters really came out of nowhere. And no one expected the first one to do so well, just like Star Wars. The second even surpassed my expectations at least and surprised the heck out of me. Pirates is the only series these days doing anything original and new. It's an old concept, but it is finally being shown the way it was meant to be shown. Everyone loves it so much, and it is a great legacy that is being sewn into history. Here's to Pirates 3.<br/><br/>10/10"
"jonnyidol","5","1","3","8 July 2006"," Overly long, boring and lifeless
","I left the theater last night feeling cheated. The movie was 2.5 hours long, therefore, had plenty of opportunities to offer viewers what should have been left behind at the editing room. Trivial stories felt uncomfortably short to add anything significant to the whole picture but frustratingly long to be entertaining. That's what was appealing for the first one: clever, clean cut, and stylish.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all those elements are all but present in the sequel. The jokes are cheap and only drawing mindless and cheesy laughs. Even Johnny Depp looks like he's not very good at imitating himself. Granted, his performance in the first one was phenomenal and above all, original (only as a pirate and only in the movie industry) but his acting in this one at times pushed it too far that it seemed old and tired.<br/><br/>Computer generated images play too much of a role here. Too much of a role that human acting almost appear insignificant. Somehow, it reminded me of The Lord of the Ring, just less impressive and less coherent.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending was so obvious as a cliff hanger that it was nonsense and, well, shameless!! <br/><br/>Overall, having watched the first one, I found Dead man's chest amazingly disappointing. The kid sitting next to me, for the most part of the movie, kept looking around like he did not want to be there. Well, that makes two of us."
"sms_creed","9","1","3","8 July 2006"," my heart was pounding at the end
","I don't like to use spoilers so i won't. Pirates II is one of the best movies i've seen all year. The acting is just as good as you would expect (even bloom who i am not so fond of). After seeing this movie, I have to see the third. Nobody is going to watch this movie and not the third.<br/><br/>The only reason that I didn't give this a 10 star is because it was slow to start, but as soon as it started to get going it was remarkable just how good it was. The comic relief is well placed and all funny, the cgi is fantastic, and the story, in my opinion, is solid.<br/><br/>If you liked the first movie then this movie will make you very happy, and when it's over you will find yourself counting the days till #3."
"pgr-fw","5","1","3","8 July 2006"," Not awful, just a long way down from ""Black Pearl""
","It's rare that I go to an opening night, but we love ""Black Pearl"" so much we just had to. The theater was full 20 minutes before show time, the anticipation was electric. I was expecting the audience to be as much fun as the movie.<br/><br/>And in a way, I was right. Once the film started rolling, the air went out of the crowd pretty fast. A slow, boring opening, followed by a rather ridiculous sequence that just provided a vehicle for Will to meet up with Jack Sparrow. You might ask how I could condemn something in a POTC movie as ""implausible"", but I will. The whole sequence wouldn't have been less forced if Will and Jack had bumped into each other at a Starbucks in Tampa.<br/><br/>It picks up somewhat after that, I suppose, but it still has more stuffed in that it needs or can competently carry. It seems they had a lot of ideas from people they couldn't say no to, so they threw it in somewhere.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow was considerably less animated than in ""Pearl"". It looked more like someone playing Johnny Depp playing Jack Sparrow than the brilliantly eccentric performance of the first movie. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, well, they're still gorgeous. <br/><br/>Davey Jones is particularly interesting visually, as are some of the other human/sea creatures. Many of the humans are a waste, sometimes overdoing old jokes from the first movie. It's only ironic once when a pirate shows a surprising flash of educational sophistication.<br/><br/>This whole second movie is just a setup for the third movie, and that's not the only way it reminds me of ""Star Wars"". One of the creatures in particular I think ILM just pulled out some of their old work from ""Return of the Jedi"". Others in my clan noted similarities to Indiana Jones movies, and that some of the bad guys seem to have patterned their characters on Orcs. <br/><br/>Sigh. I wanted so much to love ""Dead Man's Chest."" And I don't hate it, just like I didn't hate ""The Empire Strikes Back."" But both left me unsatisfied, for a lot of similar reasons. I don't like paying full price for what's essentially an extended trailer for the next sequel. I'm disappointed when a terrific actor playing a terrific character comes out flat the second time around. (Let's hope Johnny Depp doesn't fall as far as Harrison Ford did the third time around.) And it's only a minor compensation when the character special effects are drastically improved over the first round.<br/><br/>Advice: See ""Dead Man's Chest"" but don't knock yourself out. It will be in the dollar theater soon enough."

"tugger90","10","1","3","8 July 2006"," The sad part
","Okay...I agree with the other review. The only think that agrivated me at all was that the movie was rather long, And there was a constant build up of events that created a very interesting plot. This build up even continued in the last 15 minuites(including the ending). The ending was shocking and the movie seemed as good if not better then the first. I was,however, disappointed that at the end they leave you with the plot and not too much more. There should be another movie due to the way everything was put together. The wait for the next movie is what is killing me...I have to wait. When this is released, I would rent or buy it so you can review all the information before seeing the third installment.

","Pirates 2 is follows on the adventure of the infamous Jack Sparrow (Depp) who bundles his way into troublesome situations after another. This time he owes an unpaid blood debt to Davy Jones played brilliantly by Bill Nighy. While Will and Elizabeth are arrested by the East India Trading Company lead by the villainous Lord Beckett. Lord Beckett then sends Will off to get Jacks compass in exchange for freedom. <br/><br/>All the stars return for Pirates 2, with Mr Gibbs adopting a much bigger role. Jack Sparrow is more the centre of interest, with Will and Elizabeth holding far more Supporting roles with Jack and Davy Jones taking big roles.

With the lifelike approach to Davey Jones Kraken, a large octopus like animal which drags ships down to their watery grave. A sword fight in a giant moving wheel between Jack, Will and Norrington is also extremely spectacular and comical in several ways. Even the special effects on Davey Jones tentacle face make him look menacing. <br/><br/>Pirates 2 also brings many things from the first movie which Pirates fans will like to see.

"thebekaexperience","8","1","3","8 July 2006"," Better than I expected
","I ordered my tickets about a week in advance for the first midnight showing of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I must admit, as excited as I was walking into the theatre I was a little apprehensive. I wasn't sure that the second installment of Pirates could compete with the original. Boy was I wrong. The story may have not been the most original but the characters kept it going. Even ""the bad guys"" were incredible, and their costumes were brilliant, from Davey Jones' octopus face to his Conch shell-headed slave. The special effects were just unbelievable, the CGI totally blew me away. And all of the actors clearly put tremendous work into their characters, the cast was perfect. I will definitely see it again and I can not wait for the third one (rumored to be starring Keith Richards). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer (CSI, Without A Trace) seems to be taking over the big screen as well as television, the new and improved Aaron Spelling. Keep it up."

","I thought this movie was very adventurous with a brilliant plot. Seeing as I've only seen it once though, I cannot truly judge it with the first. However, I feel if I see it a few more times I'd be able to say I like it better. It is a bit confusing but as the plot unfolds you realize the genius of it all and begin to really appreciate it. The biggest fault of the movie though is the humor. They took the stuff people found funny in the first film and glorified it, just over-doing the same-old jokes. Especially about the rum. Another fault are the graphics. Just about everyone in Davey Jones' crew, including a giant octopus they have, have much animation, if not all animation, put into it and though the effects are good, it still kind of seems too sci-fi and fake. But the plot makes up for the both these faults, despite the abrupt ending that will leave you waiting for the 3rd one. This one is definitely a two-parter with the next movie. The action is all right, most of it is at the end. I feel that they've taken some of the action from the first movie and replaced it with comedy. But the adventure in this movie is just fantastic as well as the story-line which they've set up greatly for the next one. A must-see in my opinion."
"vcyho","8","1","3","7 July 2006"," Better than Superman Returns? You bet!
","Now before everybody starts bombarding me with replies of disgust and disdain, please allow me to justify my heading.<br/><br/>First off, when I heard that Pirates was going to be 2 1/2 hours long, I simply groaned. After seeing Superman Returns, which was also of the same duration, I soon developed an aversion towards any Hollywood blockbuster that would dare to go that same length. This is not to say that SR was a bad movie (on the contrary), it simply FELT like 2 1/2 hours. The whole movie could've moved at smoother/faster pace. To my great surprise, Pirates was nothing like SR. For unlike SR, Pirates didn't FEEL like 2 1/2 hours. There was never a boring moment and every scene had a fresh spontaneity to it. Here is why I thought it was more enjoyable: <br/><br/>The story to SR was quite formulaic (the hero who does good, the love interest, the villain wanting some form of domination, yadda-yadda). Being such, we already know what the blueprint of the story is going to be. Every scene then begins to feel obligatory. The movie goes through the motion of conveying every clichéd scene that needs to be shown in order to tell the same story...and as a consequence, we have to sit through it and take in the motions. From the scene on the rooftop with Superman and Lois Lane (purpose: to re-assure the audience there is still an interest between the two), to the scene where Lex Luther almost kills Superman (purpose: to build up to the final climax of the movie). As a result, the movie starts to feel bogged down by these conventions, leaving a rather stale feeling. As well, the 2 1/2 hour duration really begins to sink in as we sit through every obligatory boring moment.<br/><br/>Pirates, on the other-hand, is not built on a conventional story. Everything is spontaneous, there are surprises left-right-and-center, and the actors are given enough freedom to do whatever they wish with their characters (not simply treat them as prescribed archetypes). As a result, there is never a boring moment! There were so many turns in the story that I actually found myself looking forward to what awaits in the next scene. And what comes next develops into more havoc and hilarity. There was something fresh about this experience that I found exhilarating, making the 2 1/2 hour fly by. As well, the roles were all so delicious and juicy that I found it an absolute treat to watch these actors have fun with them (from Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow to Bill Nighy's Davy Jones, and from the comedic duo Lee Arenberg & Mackenzie Crook (Pintel & Ragetti) to the surprise cameo in the end).<br/><br/>SR's flaw was that it over-reached: it tried to be an epic film. With that kind of goal and expectation it ended up relying too heavily on prescribed formulas, was too tightly latched onto its linear narrative, and gave us characters who seemed to take their roles and purpose too seriously (though my hats off to Kevin Spacey for giving Lex Luther a humorous edge). Pirates was the opposite. It was all fun from the get go, the narrative was loose enough to take some fun detours along the way, and it felt like the actors were all having one big party. This is what a summer movie is all about! Of course, this is simply my opinion. For a summer movie, I think Pirates 2 fulfilled my entertainment needs and left me eagerly anticipating for Pirates 3 (SR did not)."

","Wow... just wow This is one of those amazing second installment that defies the normal trilogy pattern. It is keeps up the standards that were instilled in the first. The only thing i really disliked was the fact that Orlando Bloom was in it *mublesfreekinprettyboymumbles* sorry bout that, i don't really like him as an actor. Anyways, back to business. This was just stupendous, it blended a great plot along with some good slapstick, went into even more in depth characterization, had a beautiful soundtrack (as expected by old Hanz(yes i am a dork)). And the originality from the first one WHILE keeping the same tone and mood was also well done. The only REAL downside was the ending CURSE YOU CLIFFHANGERS!!!!!"

","I just got back from seeing Pirates of the Caribbean- Dead man's Chest.<br/><br/>Now- I'm not going to give anything away but basically- Jack's back and it looks like he's done it again- and brought poor Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner With him.<br/><br/>Now... Mr. Turner meets up with someone he never in a million years would have believed he'd find himself working along side of. Elizabeth has a small crisis of her own and Captain Jack? Well... Its Jack.<br/><br/>So what's new? Well, for starters, the plot, the action, the comedy, the special effects, and of course, the legendary Cracken.<br/><br/>All of these make for a fantastic movie. The audience clapped out loud in many places, laughed in many places, and even gasped in quite a few places... and just when you think you have things figured out... Trust me... you don't.<br/><br/>There are a lot of twists and turns that will actually take you by surprise, and the ending- I'm not going to say anything... but trust me. The only way you could POSSIBLY predict the way its going to end, is if someone told you what happened ahead of time.<br/><br/>This movie had a running time of just over 2 1/2 hours... but when the movie came to an end.... it was kind of surprising, it didn't feel like you were in the theater that long because you became so involved in the action.<br/><br/>However... This movie is rated PG-13, and for good reason. Not only suggestive comedy- but some stuff that may be a bit too scary for younger viewers. (Some of this stuff does get pretty dark.) So for the enjoyment of other audience members- please keep age appropriateness in mind. (You don't know how annoying it is to see a 5 year old in a movie like this, screaming and crying, and constantly having to watch the parents pick her up and take her out during the scary parts. Thats not only annoying for other viewers, but how can the parents be enjoying the movie? for the cost of the kid's ticket- get a babysitter.) the final installment to this trilogy to be released in 2007 is tentatively called ""Pirates of the Caribbean- At World's End."" <br/><br/>""To Davy Jones's Locker With Ye"" <br/><br/>Captain Jack is Back <br/><br/>Yo Ho"

","This is an awesome movie. I must warn you it leaves you on a cliff. The acting once again is phenomenal. The visual effects are amazing, the Kraken seems so real when it shows up. and Davy Jones and his crew look so real its amazing how far CG has come. The story has a few plots, which all combine into the main story perfectly. I can't wait until the third movie comes out, and it better come out soon. The very last minute leaves you going GAH!!! Whens the next one? It should be out in 6-8 months or so, and I may bash my face into a wall in anticipation. I think Gore verbinski is one of the best directors out there. He took a hard to use theme like pirates, and turned it into one amazing adventure, seemingly without braking a sweat. We need more directors like him."
"moaning","10","1","3","7 July 2006"," Best movie of the year!!!!
","This movie is AMAZING and is definitely the movie of the year. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are three of the most best actors in the movie. It is hilarious and some of the scenes have you in complete fits of giggles. Johnny is beautiful as usual and when he goes down with his ship at the end you can just tell he's coming back for more. I also loved the scene where you first meet the pirate physic she is wicked and her hut is ace. I can't wait for next years to come out it's going to be hard to wait but I think it will be worth it. In my opinion the second was just as good as the first (meaning that it didn't do what some movie sequels do!!!)It was quite different from the first but it definitely was one of the best things I've seen this year!!!"
"obisc","9","1","3","7 July 2006"," Great!
","One of the best movies I have seen this year. Much better than the original, although the end is a bit of a cliffhanger and may disturb some people, Depp, Bloom & Knightley make a fantastic cast to the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels. In this second movie, we see a much broader side to Elizabeth Swann, who has finally come out of her shell & recognized that to survive with a pirate one must be a pirate himself. Same goes to Will Turner, who unlike the last movie has actually accepted his role as a pirate, just like his father. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is one movie you will not want to miss!"
"archerking9-1","10","1","3","7 July 2006"," Amazing. (SPOILER FREE!)
","Let me start off by saying that I LOVED the first film. The acting was superb, the direction was outstanding, the CGI broke records, and the music was excellent. So, imagine my excitement when I learned about DMC. Then, after years of anticipation, extremely negative reviews started to come in. I admit, I was nervous.<br/><br/>The critics, as it turned out, were wrong.<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,"" was absolutely AMAZING, and an instant classic in every way. The film both matched and exceeded the first film in every way. Depp surpassed his previous performance. Every character was well acted, particularly (and, surprisingly) Elizabeth and Davy Jones. Verbrinski's direction kept the overall tone light, fun, and made this the best popcorn flick of the summer. Zimmer's score was very different from Badelt's, but it suited the film well.<br/><br/>And, finally, The CGI in DMC was fantastic. Davy Jones is without a doubt the greatest CG character ever put to screen. The Flying Dutchman was great, and, most importantly, the Kraken was perfect. If ""Pirates"" does not win an Oscar for make-up or visual effects, I am boycotting the Academy.<br/><br/>Simply put, DMC is AMAZING. Ignore the critics, head to the theater, and see the summer's best film."
"phaedra_j","10","1","3","7 July 2006"," Fantastically Funny!
","After months of waiting for the sequel to my favorite movie, I finally got to see what I had been so long anticipating, and I wasn't disappointed. This movie stays with the spirit of the first film, but also adds a lot to the depth and personality of the characters. As always, Jack Sparrow steals the show with his humorous antics, but some characters will really surprise you. Elizabeth has become very manipulative, using her feminine wiles to get what she wants. Norrington is a drunkard with his own agenda, and Will is as always the hero. The villain in this film, Davy Jones, is awesome to watch, having expressions that made you think that his tentacle covered face could actually be real. The crew of the Flying Dutchman was fantastic, and I must say my heart was beating fast for a few moments during the fight scenes. All camp aside, I loved this movie, it made me laugh, and jump, and gasp. It's definitely worth seeing again, and again, and again"
"joebandelli","9","1","3","7 July 2006"," Barbossa Bitches
","OK, well for all of you who expected this movie to be as good as the first that's just stupid because there are barely any movies that are better than the first. The only one that I can think of is Terminator 2. Anyway back to the movie. It was as long as the first one and it was very good. There were some parts where the movie kind of got a little slow but it kept picking up and Johnny Depp's acting once again was excellent. The new edition of Davy Jones was excellent and the CGI was very well done. The fighting scenes and the action sequences were once again brilliant. For all of you who disagree with me and think this movie was OK and perhaps a little slow, all of that changes with the cliffhanger ending of seeing Captain Barbossa still alive. I'm extremely excited to see the third installment of this movie because Geoffrey Rush plays a great Captain Barbossa and that ending was great and kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the credits to watch a dumb scene where the tribe was about to eat the dog. Overall though I liked this movie and give it a 7."
"Bixie23","9","1","3","7 July 2006"," Second ""Pirates"" An Even Wilder Ride
","Yes, I was one of the goofballs who, in true fan fashion, lined up outside my multiplex for the 12:01 am showing of a film I've been anticipating for years. Moreover, I had the lack of sense to bring my 9 year old daughter, having just allowed her two weeks ago to watch the first installment of this fabulous franchise. Guess what...it was no goof! ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" has the luxury of jumping right into the story. This is no film where you suffer through the first twenty minutes of background; we reacquaint ourselves with our favorite characters in moments and the action begins...and very rarely stops! This movie is so fast-paced to be almost frenetic (but in a good way). For those who, like Elizabeth, lost track of whose side Jack was on in the first film, it is another struggle to keep up (of course, we all know Jack is always on Jack's side). The mood is dark and scary most times, but also contains an underlying humor to lighten the mood.<br/><br/>The character of Elizabeth Swann is broadened nicely, while Jack Sparrow (er...Captain Jack Sparrow) and Will Turner continue in the same vein as the first movie. Several familiar faces make appearances, but the highlight was the seamless interweave of the CGI characters with the live action ones, particularly Davy Jones. Though the ""Lord of the Rings"" franchise pioneered the completely CGI character, it has been just as masterfully accomplished in this film. Bill Nighy performed all of Davy Jones' acting through motion capture on set with the other actors which allowed complete believability in their interactions. Had I not known of the CGI nature of the character, I might have suspected some fabulous makeup and effects works, so lifelike was the character.<br/><br/>Don't expect all your loose ends tied up; most of us know the third installment was filmed concurrently with this and this movie is left wide open. Enjoy the ride, however, for Captain Jack and crew have hoisted sails and are ready to brave the rough waters of sequeldom admirably."
"aqua_swing","8","1","3","7 July 2006"," Avast! Craploads of characters, but Jack keeps some of it in check.
","Ah, Pirates. The movie of the summer, I'd imagine. Regardless of whether this thing is going to get good or bad reviews, people are going to go in droves to this thing, and they should.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie were self explanatory, really. For me, and for most people it was Depp again, but I saw that coming. This seemed to be another one of those ""The movie is alright but his performance makes it grand"" thing, only not so much as say Secret Window or the Ninth Gate where he was 'making' those movies completely good. This one had a strong cast, but at the same time had a whole huge load of a supporting cast, and could make anyone paying half attention to the story easily confused (like the person sitting beside me).<br/><br/>It had some great CGI things with the evil pirates from Davy Jones' ship, and the little story involved with Will Turner and Bootstrap Bill was introduced quite well, because it gave both the viewer, and the people involved that ""out of nowhere"" feeling, so it was easily identifiable. They do tend to pack a whole crapload into the first hour or so, just to have that 'wrapping up' feeling to make sure that you're following along from the previous film, which seemed to be the same as the first hour of Superman Returns (which was only 4 minutes longer. Howabout that!). But like Superman Returns, the rest of the movie following that hour is smooth sailing until it's hang-ending that you can see coming from a mile away if you're paying full attention to the film and not just staring at Captain Jack and waiting for him to do something funny. Oh, and Keira Knightley's in this movie too. I forgot that. She's cute, and mostly lost in the shuffle behind all of the other massive amounts of characters that are there as a seemingly effortless (but actually not quite) plan of wrapping everything up in the third film.<br/><br/>The one thing I do like above everything else about number two is how much darker it was. It wasn't the happy, almost always sunny movie the first movie was, this was something a bit darker, a bit scarier, and a bit uglier. That's how it should be, and they pulled that off beautifully, savvy?"
"joekur","8","1","3","7 July 2006"," Lots of Fun!

Not for the squeamish, but those scenes aren't all bad...<br/><br/>You have to pay attention to the development, and a review of the first film will probably help. There's an interesting and intricate story run through the film, with a few fun sub-plots. The movie expressed the concept of redemption by many of the characters, on many levels in many ways. Well done there!<br/><br/>Lot's of funny and memorable lines. Elizabeth Swann's character (Keira) seems to me to be a much more highly involved character in this one. Though I'm sure there's room for argument there.<br/><br/>Go see it and you will likely enjoy yourself!"

I can't wait until Pirates 3 is released and I only hope that it can continue in the foot steps already established by 1 & 2.<br/><br/>The make up is fantastic I can't imagine what those actors had to sit through each day in preparation for filming, hats off to the make-up artists... and artists they truly are.<br/><br/>Obviously one hated to see the movie end... yes I will say it's a major cliff hanger and leave it at that.

"stevox83","8","1","3","7 July 2006"," ""The Curse of the Unintended Trilogy""
","First off let me say that it was a great action adventure movie with lots of fun sword fighting, ship battles, and rum jokes. That said; it was not nearly as good as the first movie. Here is why.<br/><br/>The first ""Pirates"" movie was a stand-alone story with solid intro, plot development, and closure. When the movie did as well as it did, the 'Big Wigs' told the writers to expand the story into a trilogy. The writers never planned to develop an extended story so they ended up pulling one out of their arrses. If you need another good example of this, look a the Matrix trilogy. As opposed to having a well planned out trilogy storyline such as ""Star Wars"" or ""Lord of the Rings"" it simply stretched the concept out, recycled old jokes, and left us with so many plot treads to contemplate at the end that we basically need to watch the final installment for closure on this movie.<br/><br/>The acting is as good as always, and as far as the character development goes; Knightley is the only one who's character kinda takes a dive as she is now ""love torn"" between Bloom and Depp's character. When did this happen? I don't know either.<br/><br/>Despite it's problems it still kept me on the edge of my seat and I would suggest going to see it just for the beautiful cinematography and action."

It is of course spectacular beyond belief, with plenty of amazing action being played out against the most vivid backgrounds, but I guess the only negative was a somewhat convoluted story, and slightly unintelligible dialogue from Davy's Crew (the molluscs seemed to get in the way a bit). But don't let me put you off. The whole thing is well worth your time and money and I was especially amused by one of Cap'n Sparrow's spectacular escapes - good use of fruit. Good sea monster too. Go sea!"

","This movie of course, isn't perfect, with a few odd moments, but it sure is one fine movie. Sure, there were some cheesy moments and stunts but they did make the audience laugh and me a couple of times. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) has returned in this sequel to the first Pirates of the Carrribean film. Also returning are Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley), the romantic couple. This movie contains action, great special effects and a little bit of humor coming from the characters. The stunts are good, but some of them are a little stupid. The effects are amazing, it had me awed and made me wonder how long it took to make a particular sequence.<br/><br/>The downside is that it is just too long. Chock full of action and effects, it was just too long, and I wasn't really impressed with the ending too. However, this movie does have the occasional surprise and funny moment and I recommend this to families that want to watch something exciting and funny."
"Puffy2454","7","1","3","7 July 2006"," Only slightly above average
","Pirates of The Caribbean 2 has the problem that all legacies face: being compared with itself. The original fare was a massive success and loved by all; with this said, it is unfortunate that I have deemed the sequel only slightly above average.<br/><br/>First the pros: the CGI is top notch and the sets and cinemotagraphy are beautiful. The costumes are also top notch and should be given a nod come Oscar time. But now to the Cons: in my opinion, Capt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), the character everyone came to fall in love with, fell short in this movie. It seemed as if his purpose was minimized as only to provide comic relief. Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) does fairly well as he has certainly matured since the last movie but Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) is nearly nonexistent in this movie. Though the parts were acted well, the three stars did not live up to the first.<br/><br/>The secondary characters had an excellent opportunity to shine in this one, which I felt was a great addition.<br/><br/>Long....this movie clocked in at around 2 1/2 hours - I felt much of it could have been cut out.<br/><br/>But through all of this, I will say this: I am guaranteed to see the final POTC. Like the Matrix trilogy - though the second one may not live up to the first, maybe because the first set the bar so high, or because it simply fell short on all angles - I, like others, will want to see the final chapter; to see how it all ends.<br/><br/>But in conclusion, I'm not saying don't see the movie, but don't let the hype get to you. I feel as if so much hype was around this movie (I mean I went to a premiere in which +100 were dressed as pirates) it couldn't live up the bar which was raised. So go into this movie w/ the goal not to judge it against the original, but by itself. And by itself, its above average."

","On their wedding day Will (Bloom) and Elizabeth (Knightley) are arrested by Cutler Beckett (Tom Hollander) for helping Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) escape in the previous film. To save themselves Will is given the task of tracking Sparrow down and coming back with his compass. Jack, however, is having problems of his own as an old debt comes back to haunt him (literally).<br/><br/>This is a good film. One immediate problem I have is its length. At 150 minutes it's only a touch longer than the original, but it feels like 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>Where the first film was funny in a sly way PotC 2 tries to be funny, and this never works except in spoofs. Trying to bring back so many of the original cast, especially Lee Arenberg and Mackenzie Crook as light relief doesn't work and their scenes could be largely cut to save time.<br/><br/>The original cast (Depp, Bloom and Knightley) slip back in to their original parts well. My one criticism is that Bloom's naive, put upon Will is trying now. Where he should have grown and matured he still walks around with a slapped puppy-dog look for most of the time and it doesn't work anymore. Depp is brilliant.<br/><br/>The villains. In this type of film you need to be slightly pantomime to not get lost under the weight of the films premise. Bill Nighy as Davy Jones looks a little lost under the weight of make-up and CG needed for his character. A little bigger performance would have gone down a treat. Tom Hollander's Beckett is good, but again the twists and turns of the plot seem to bury him. Maybe he'll really get some screen time and something worthy to do in the last part.<br/><br/>Brilliant action scenes both on land and at sea fill out the summer blockbuster criteria. From the slightly comic, tongue-in-cheek fights between Depp, Bloom and the returning Jack Davenport as Norrington to massive, ship smashing clashes between The Flying Dutchman and The Black Pearl as well as an appearance from the Kraken, a huge sea monster raised by Davy Jones. You really feel these set-pieces.<br/><br/>A good night out, but as the middle part of the trilogy it feels slightly incomplete and needs a little more bite. Go and see it, it'll leave you wanting the final part."

"blackburnroversworld","9","1","3","6 July 2006"," A good sequel? Surely not?
","###SPOILERS### Last night I viewed the staff showing of this film, and being an avid fan of the first one I was desperately waiting for this one. Once I sat down though, I started having a more neutral view on the film. The film could almost be a standalone film on its own! Everything is original bar the arrest of Will and Elizabeth! The CGI was amazing but you do find sometimes there is too much seafaring. That sounds ridiculous in a pirate movie but a few times you just wish there are some good battles and more swashbuckling. The fact we don't meet Davy Jones until after halfway through causes a bit of a drag, but its nothing major.<br/><br/>For a 12A film it contains a decent amount of death and destruction, I think the only thing keeping it from a higher rating was the lack of swearing and sex.<br/><br/>Everything in the film looks like it has had detail and attention, and character development is brilliant. Jack Sparrow as the lovable rogue looking out for himself but good at heart, and the ""Turners"" being the honourable goodies after freedom.<br/><br/>The end is very good, and a lot better than X-Men 3's shoddy ending. It gives a sense of appreciation and amazement about certain characters and gives us hope for the third one! You can tell this film was made strictly to always have a sequel, as there is no finite ending in terms of the villain being overcome. However I am so glad he got his apples!"
"saint_laurent_girl","7","1","3","5 July 2006"," Dead Man's Chest not as good as first, but just as fun!
","I was lucky enough to win two tickets to see the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest preview before the release date. I looked forward to it so much and I have to say, it was past my expectations. Being a sequel to the highly successful first Pirates film, many people thought it would just be a shadow of the first film, but I am happy to say, it was not. The acting of Johnny Depp (Captian Jack Sparrow), Keria Knightly (Elizabeth Swann) and Orlando Bloom (William Turner)was just as good, if not better than the first. Also, many new and old characters did well in making the film very enjoyable. The plot unfortunately was all over the place and difficult to understand, you could see the writers wanted it to be a little bit more depthful than the first. I guess you could say though, 'depthfulness' Dons't really suit the film! The humour was up to its standard, just as hilarious as the first, but they seemed to use many jokes from the first film which sort of ruined it a bit. I will tell you this though: Captain Jack Sparrow's entry into the film is just as funny as in the first one! I think the main thing that pulls you into the film is the uncanny darkness the other film Dons't have. It was a bit overwhelming at first but you got used to it after a while. I'm sure many people would agree with me when I say that there was not enough action at the beginning and too much at the end as well, but I guess it all adds up to the next Pirates film, which I am so looking forward too! Overall, The characters and ideas of the film are still the same but the film is sort of hammed up with too much information. I guarantee though, you will leave the movies totally satisfied and hanging off your seat for the next film- which is the other half of the Pirates trilogy!"

","There are not many movies which I'd like to see for the second time. There are not many of them which I remember vividly. But this is one of them. The opening scene is particularly notable for being excellently filmed and for the music.<br/><br/>Just as I wrote in my review of ""The Curse of Black Pearl"" the whole trilogy has deep symbolic meaning of its own, despite the whole entertaining orientation. Though it doesn't fail to entertain either and I'm surprised to see that so many people seemingly dislike it so much. Don't know what the mob was expecting. I've read comments and still I don't quite get it.<br/><br/>It's been said that the dialogs are poorly written. How so? In fact the phrase ""pretending to read the Bible is a lie"" alone deserves an Oscar, for it's one of the most laconic sentences for hypocritical modern society. (Perhaps that's why so many negative opinions? Well, then you got the message, guys, whether you like it or not. Don't blame the mirror for what you're seeing in it.) What's next? Plot is too convoluted? Go watch ""Harry Potter"" or Jackson's 'adaptation' of Tolkien. That'll be right on your level.<br/><br/>It's been also said that the acting was poor as well. Again why? Surely, Bloom isn't quite as expressive as Depp, so what? People are different. I failed to notice any technical flaw in his performance.<br/><br/>Oh, and I don't want even to comment on characters being ""not believable"" in a fantasy (!) movie. Go watch documentaries - there you'll find the realm of unsurpassed credibility.<br/><br/>Bottomline: it's a perfect sequel, which keeps stylistically and substantially in line with the first film. Highly recommended for both artistic value and fun.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Chibichasechan","10","1","4","13 June 2007"," Very Well Done!
","I do not have much to say of this movie, but let me just say it is definitely an amazing movie and captures all of the people's attention in the form of pirating. I believe this movie to be very well done and exciting, definitely better than the first one, and more realistic. Definitely does not ruin the first one, like most sequels do. This just adds on to the creativity of the first one, and makes the series more popular than it ever was. Deifnatly worth the 3 year wait between 1 and 2, and I still remember to this day how I felt when I found out the truth of that amazing ending, that left me hanging off the edge of a cliff, gasping for air no longer in my lungs because I froze on the spot. But I am not going to spoil anything for people who haven't seen it who eventually will. I have explained everything else about these series in my 1st Pirates comment so I am not going to get into too much detail. But the movie was defiantly funnier than the first one, and the acting was a bit better since the actors have a more general idea on who their character is, and what he/she does, and their personality. Take Jack Sparrow for example, everyone loves him dearly because he a good actor, and apparently looks ""hot"" as the role. He seems like the hero to everyone doesn't he? But really he wants everything for himself and wants everything to go his way, even if he does seem like the hero. Don't underestimate him! 10/10"
"PrincessGuinevere","10","1","4","30 January 2007"," Very clever and funny
","This movie was clever, daring, funny (and I dare say, sexy). The action scenes were annoying but they fixed them up with Captain Jack's antics. When I first saw it I saw it with lots of friends, some who had seen it before. It was at the movies and I got TERRIFIED but enjoyed it immensely. When I walked out all I could think about for ages was Captain Jack being eaten by the Kraken. It gave me butterflies and made me feel weird. I went on the internet straight away to find out whether he was alive for the next movie. I was very happy to see he is. I wasn't surprised but right after seeing it I doubted him coming back so I was quite sad. If you don't know then you should be happy to know that he's OK- but everyone knows that now. I was so sad when he died though it was kind of depressing. I'm going on a bit. Sorry. The Jack And Elizabeth hook up was a shock but I think it's good. I don't really like Will's character in general but I love Elizabeth and Jack so I think they are perfect for each other- but really, Lizzie has to sort out her priorities. Overall the Pirates of the Caribbean movies are my favourites of all time, and gradually more favourites have been added to my list, the PotC films have had a firm grasp. GREAT FILM"

"sazo-2","9","1","4","28 January 2007"," As good as the first
","Very few sequels receive the same appreciation as their successful predecessors. Think to Matrix, Back to the Future or Indiana Jones. All of these films first parts are in the top 250, but their sequels failed to obtain this performance (however Indiana Jones managed to recover with the third part). I think the main reason why most of the viewers, who liked the first part and did not the second, is because the sequel didn't carry the magic of novelty.<br/><br/>When the first Pirates of the Caribbean came out, it was new, it was fresh, nothing really have looked similar to it before. It mixed adventure, fantasy, humor, great visuals and very good sound.<br/><br/>The director didn't took any chances, he followed the successful recipe. The sequel is good looking, funny, well acted and most of all, and in this characteristic it exceeds the first one in my opinion, it is very dynamic. However after the first one, this genre is not new, so for many it just won't be as good as the first one.<br/><br/>If you liked the first one, don't hesitate seeing this one. It holds the same qualities as it's predecessor. At first I thought the 150 minutes will be too much, but the film is action packed and if you like this kind of entertainment, you will not get bored for a single minute. And maybe the final part will have the similar fate as the third part of Indiana Jones. I hope so. 9/10"

","Once again the slurring, swaying, scoundrel by the name of Jack Sparrow is back, played ever so brilliantly by who is now my favourite actor (Johnny Depp). This time, he has a debt to pay. To the devil of the seas, the convincingly slimy Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). Once again, the three main characters, Jack, Will (Orlando Bloom), and Elizabeth(Keira Knightly), are sent into a wild, crazy adventure involving cannibals, crusty sea men, a giant tentacled behemoth and a beating heart. The excitement is unrelenting, and after two and a half hours, I wanted more. There is a lot of laughs, lots of amazing special effects, and lots of prime popcorn movie material. Jerry Bruickheimer usually delivers great movies, so I was expecting even more than the first Pirates. I did. It was bigger, darker, and everything a sequel should be, easily by favourite sequel since the Two Towers. The surprise ending leaves me waiting impatiently for the third. Great, great movie. I hope Johnny gets credit for his portrayal. He rocks."

","It is great to see some film writing that is imaginative and entertaining while not being too much the standard shtick of Hollywood. Some of the new fight scenes are in this very category new ways of fighting with swords that will have Sinbad the sailor fans enthralled. The fights combine with humor as seen before, but have new twists. While this movie leads to the sequel, it is great to see it on a large screen. Coupling mythology and history has the advantage of providing great entertainment. If you have not seen the previous movie, do see it as it will add to the enjoyment of this movie. On the mythology, you may find yourself wanting to dig into some of the stories and books which touch on Davy Jones, etc. A unique experience."

","I have to say upfront that I wasn't particularly impressed by the original and was very surprised that Johnny Depp's overrated performance ended up among the Best Actor Oscar nominees. This sequel proves to be an even less attractive commodity: the epitome of the empty-headed and over-produced summer blockbuster, the film is tiresomely long while providing nothing that's remotely new, very little plot (with the much-sought titular object coming to little purpose!) and an over-abundance of effects (there are about four separate attacks by The Kraken alone!) to make up for its lazy scripting.<br/><br/>While the original was supposed to evoke the Saturday matinée' adventure films of old, this one has little real feeling for the genre; the accent is on the supernatural (what this has to do with a pirate film in the first place is baffling to say the least, and doesn't work quite as much as the film-makers seem to think either!) which allows the make-up department a free hand to create the silliest-looking creatures this side of the ""Star Wars"" saga! The stars seem to be merely going through the paces this time around: Johnny Depp overdoes the roguish charm (again!), while Orlando Bloom is as bland as ever; Keira Knightley, after her star-making turn in the original, is under-used here (as if the film-makers didn't quite know what more to do with her!). As for the 'ghosts', we have a ridiculously-tentacled main villain played by the little-known Bill Nighy (who had previously appeared in another saga which vulgarized a myth {or two}, the ""Underworld"" films) and Stellan Skarsgard (making little impression) as Bloom's 'undead' pirate father.<br/><br/>The film ends on a cliffhanger on the lines of the first entry in ""The Lord Of The Rings"" saga and also features an uncredited bit by Geoffrey Rush (turning up at the end to reprise his role from the first installment in the series, whose third episode is already being filmed...which means that we have to suffer through another Summer of this). Mind you, the film is entertaining enough in a mindless {sic} sort of way, but it's all overkill in the end...and, really, the creators of this franchise ought to think more of their audiences rather than merely thinking of how to fill their own pockets (this film's phenomenal box-office performance is preposterous)!!"
"redeyedtreefrog","6","1","4","11 August 2006"," Where's the last pages
","I really enjoyed the first installment. Johnny Depp is magical in his movements. He bobs and weaves his head, his whole body. His expressions are in a category of their own. Keira Knightly and Orlando Bloom gave a decent performance. The special effects for Davy Jones, in particular, were grade A. I have to say, though, that there were a couple of disappointments that made it not worth paying to see it on the big screen. The story took too long to get into the action. My father used to infuriate his brother by cutting out the last two pages of whatever his brother was reading. To me this movie ended that way. I know it is setting things up for the third installment but it's a movie, not a soap opera. I hope the third one redeems this major disappointment."

","Full of expectations I watched this movie. I had already seen the first in the cinema and I loved it. From the start on I knew this movie could not be as good as the previous. It looked a lot like the previous, only shorter and not as spectacular. And that problem stays the entire time. The entire movie is almost exactly the same as The Black Pearl, only the treasure is something different. But where the first film could keep your attention by a good and original story line and nice action scenes from time to time, Dead Mans Chest seems to have lost that. There are way too many action scenes and most last too long. The story is as predictable as what and the romance is so annoying. If you look at the storyline I think this should not have been a trilogy because part 2 and 3 (if 3 is going to be like this) could well have been 1 movie. What's left is a brainless action movie. Just like the Matrix Reloaded this movie just seems to ruin a great concept for the sake of money."

She chains him up to be killed so she can save everyone Else's asses. Everyone uses an excuse saying this film is only a lead up to the 3rd. Well my friends thats BULLSHIT. As a filmmaker you respect your viewers who are taking their own time out of their lives to sit down and watch what you put on screen. I don't want to watch POTC 2 and a half.

But unfortunately the good idea of the Flying Dutchman and the Giant Octopus was poorly converted. The movie still gets four points out of ten because of the good effort of Johnny Depp who did a great job as we know him.

I appreciate a script that considers that audience members have intelligence. Any fantasy needs a touch of realism to pull you into the story so that you can suspend thought and believe.

","Curse of the black pearl was a great movie. It had everything: a great love story, great plot, strong characters, adventure, humor and all in all, it was fun.<br/><br/>Now, I did not expect much from the sequel because I felt it would be hard to top the first one and I was very right. I was still excited to see the 3 characters together again, which was probably the only reason why so many people also went to see the movie and why it did so well at the box office.<br/><br/>The movie did have funny parts and you gotta love Jack Sparrow, but I was not too impressed with the characters and the ending. Now what the hell happened between Elizabeth and Jack and why on earth would the writers do that? I mean it could have been worse if they actually hooked up, but there was definitely something between them and I did not like that at all. Elizabeth struck me as a different character. She wasn't the girlie girl anymore, who wears the nice dresses and has to be rescued from the pirates. She came off as a much stronger character, and a little more manly and I am not sure I liked that. She only wore a dress for a few minutes in the whole 3 hours. The movie had enough men as it is, and it kinda needed a little bit of femininity in it, which they failed to bring. To me, the characters were a bit too confident and therefore less real than in the first one. They just seemed to have no fear whatsoever, even in very life threatening situations. The whole movie seemed like it was just a bunch of people running around, having fun. Now, the ending. Oh, the ending! When I saw that Jack got eaten by the monster I was thinking: Wow, I had to sit through all of that, but at least it will have a great ending. But, noooooo! Now they have to go save Jack, who did not actually die. What the hell was that? Why couldn't they just end it? I guess they realized that they would make even more money so they decided to drag it on even longer. Maybe it's not about making a good movie anymore and it's all about the money. How sad!!!"

This felt odd to begin with but that was soon forgotten as the story took hold. From daring fight scenes to sidesplitting fruit skewers the actions rarely stops, perfectly galloping along with a pulsating Hans zimmer score.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest Directed by: Gore Verbinski Date of Release: 2006 Starring: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley<br/><br/>Well, it's been three years, and finally the next POTC instalment has hit UK cinemas. You may remember my review of ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" whereby I had mixed feelings at the start, then grew to love it and give it the ultimate blessing by adding it to my elite DVD collection (read ""economic"" - erm...small). <br/><br/>I started getting the same mixed feelings as this one started, this could have been something to do with the countless, riotous teenage girls running around the cinema in their little hooker outfits, clutching their Nokia's and texting their mates sitting two rows behind. Then five minutes later running and giggling to another part of the cinema, the last place being directly in front of Sarah and I - a few strong words and they disappeared, leaving us to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>I think it was my inability to relax for the first 30 minutes, after which I settled into viewing mode, abolished all criticism from my mind and enjoyed a thoroughly entertaining reintroduction to the old faces.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp continues to amuse with his drunken drool and carefree attitude, while Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly appear to be acting in a completely different film all together, while Depp eases into his eccentric character, Bloom and Knightly look like they are better off playing Romeo and Juliet at London's Palladium.<br/><br/>The over-dramatic portrayals are very soon forgotten though, as we see some great favourites grace the waters from the previous film. Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg & Mackenzie Crook) play a much appreciated, larger part in this story and add their usual hilarious antics. We also see the return of Norrington (Jack Davenport) as a washed up drunk, after losing his honourable standing as Elizabeth's intended in the previous instalment.<br/><br/>What really makes the film are the new characters. With new consequences, predicaments and locations, we meet people like Tia Dalma (The black witch), Bootstrap Bill and a tribe of hungry cannibals. But without doubt, by the far the best treat has to be Davy Jones, his crew and his ship, the Flying Dutchman. Bill Nighy, unrecognisable, portrays the idiom in octopus/man form who, along with his frighteningly fantastic crew have spent too long at the bottom of the sea and are barely recognisable as humans, more so as aquatic beasts. The ship itself is a sight to behold, like an organic mass of seaweed and barnacles, the whole effect makes for excellent viewing.<br/><br/>I do have to mention the scene on the white, sandy beach where Elizabeth is trying to break up the testosterone induced sword fight -a pointless and embarrassing viewing experience. Certainly one for the cutting room floor in my opinion. <br/><br/>Perhaps the story line itself could have been improved upon, but as a Walt Disney, 12A film I didn't expect this to be up to much and it is more than made up for by action, fantasy and hilarity.<br/><br/>The film ends on a cliff hanger, ready for the next instalment, next year, where I am sure we will be served up more of the same, comfortably entertaining performance. Oh, and Keith Richards, apparently!"

","As usual, the critics can't see past the ego in their own minds. Obviously, the so-called critics of the world prove once again that it is truly a mystery as to why anyone would pay them for their comments. (come on y'all, grab some popcorn and go back to hiding in the dark. We can make up our own minds). Can't wait to see the third installment of this franchise. Yo HO! Also amazing is that as I post this comment on July 16, 2006, that the lines at the theaters for this movie have not abated in the slightest. At our local cineplex, the show has been standing room only, since it opened just over a week ago. Could this be a signal as to what the movie going public is hungry for?"

","i absolutely loved it it is exactly what a summer film should be and it was so funny. It kept the essence of the first one but slightly darker and even more slapstick without looking pathetic. *captain* jack sparrow was even funnier and even more drunk than in the first (all in a good way) Elizabeth a lot more lusty and grown up in this one than in the first and we got to see a lot more of Will Turner's character in this one even some proper attitude which is great. Davy Jones well what more do you have to say than that half squid half crab and a Scottish accent. Tia Delmar was great very very seductive character with comedy thrown in as well plus brains. The undead monkey once again creepy and cute all at the same time."

","My wife and I saw ""Pirates"" after a lengthy stretch of great anticipation. She wanted to see it because she likes the story; I was more focused on make-up, special effects and computer generation. Neither of us was disappointed.<br/><br/>Positives: excellent costuming, great make up and special effects, and some very good computer generation. Captain Jack's First Mate pretty much stole the show, as far as I am concerned. Very strong, solid performance. Choreographed fight scenes VERY well done - lots of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Bitter/Sweet: lots of silliness in this film. If it was intended to be silly and dumb, success. If the filmmaker was serious with his silliness, he blew it. Silly IS fun, though.<br/><br/>Negatives: TOO LONG! Could easily have been whacked by 1/2 hour - EASILY! Editing was amateurish; choppy. Johnny Depp seems stalled out in his creativity and execution: ""Pirates"" I & II and ""Chocolat"" seem to be rubber stamp characters, though there was more heart and depth in ""Chocolat."" Overall, I consider Mr. Depp a marginal actor.<br/><br/>Additional Negative: Keira Knightly. Difficult to look at, from a physical perspective (facially unfortunate), but more difficult to watch as a performer. Miscast in this role, to my way of thinking. It was a chance she took in her career, one she should probably not repeat.<br/><br/>Overall: see the film. No one under 12 should see it, for several scenes are inappropriate for younger children (quite gory and graphic). 12 and over? Yes - see it as a family and enjoy! SPECIAL NOTE: kudos to whoever created Davy Jones, A+."

Depp was awesome as usual, but what made the movie different from the first was that it concentrated on the other characters as well, namely Will, Mr. Gibbs, Davy Jones, Ragetti and Pintel. There was humor and non-stop action, and so many twists that makes you want to see the movie again. The CGI was top class, and the action sequences well thought of and executed. The ideal block-buster movie for the summer. I am not surprised at all that it broke the box-office record for the opening weekend, and I think that it was as good as the first movie.

Pirates from start to end had the more mature theme that was lacking in the first one. Now for the three of you who haven't seen it yet it still is appealing to children, maybe a bit scary at times, but it has its funny moments. This is another winner for Depp and the whole crew.

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", the sequel to ""Curse of the Black Pearl"", is an entertaining if average action adventure film. The same swashbuckling style returns, as well as the filmmakers including Gore Verbinski (who directed this film back to back with the 3rd film coming out in 2007). And again, Johnny Depp is superb as Captain Jack Sparrow, and unfortunately again, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley return as his co-stars (like the first film, their presence is FAR overshadowed by Depp and their so-so performances can't compare to his). This film I guess had the feel of ""I've been there before"" from other action-adventure and other pirate movies. Not great but not bad either. Would recommend - 7 out of 10."

I just about sat on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie. I loved hearing the theatre fill up with laughter, and I almost fell out of my seat a couple of times. Some parts with Johnny are just the funniest things that i have ever heard. Also there are parts that the directors did change lines within. Ohhh tricky tricky they are.

Also, the plot had so many parts to it, and was so completely muddled, that you spend most of the film trying to work out what the hell is going on.<br/><br/>But it's not all bad, as with the first movie, it was'nt the plot that was important, but the visuals and Johhny Depp. (ehehe) Firstly, the CGI effects are amazing, especially on the squid-like Davy Jones, who's tentacles move around in different directions; his fishy like crew are also very cleverly done.<br/><br/>There is also much more humour in the DMC, compared to the first film. Many hilarious laugh out moments provided by Jack Sparrow, which were probably the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are very spectacular too, combining humour and amazing stunts, one scene included a sword fight on a rolling waterwheel.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp on top form (as usual) as Jack Sparrow, as is Kevin McNally as Gibbs. However, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom did not act very well, and they did'nt do much in the film except stand around look nice.<br/><br/>Overall the movie, was too long and too complicated, with some poor acting. However, stunning visuals, comedy and piratey fun make this movie, good, light entertainment. Just make sure you've seen The curse of the Black Pearl first, or you won't get many parts of the film.<br/><br/>see this if you love the first movie and Johnny Depp, but prepare to be slightly confused."

You know the locket/music thing Davy has when Will is trying to take the key from him, the Jamaican girl has an one too! you can see it on her table in her house when Jack steals the ring off the table. Either she is the girl, or that locket will come in handy in the next movie. As for foreshadowing, I think Jack might die in the next one because A) his opening scene is him in a casket, B) he ends up in a grave (during the water wheel scene)and C) stuff that may or may not be in the first movie. So either that, or i'm just a complete idiot and its not foreshadowing anything."

","Yet again the Walt Disney film corporation has disappointed us with a sequel. I believe that the main problem with this movie is that it felt as though it was going on forever. Further, the director made the decision to forego significant and interesting plot points for, at best, mediocre special effects. In the first movie the special effects jumped out at you because the characters were ""normal"" for most of the movie as appose to this movie, which is more like Star Wars in that the monsters are always monsters. Also the characters were portrayed abysmally. For example in the first movie Elizabeth Swan is totally revolted by Capt. Jack Sparrow and is the perfect lady throughout most of the adventure; however, in the new movie she becomes a pirate like character in very little time and goes so far as to kiss Capt. Jack Sparrow. Which was a cliché and rather predictable plot twist. Nonetheless, if you saw the first movie and enjoyed it I think that you should go see this one if for no other reason than to form your own opinion."
"vardoegers","7","1","4","11 July 2006"," 7/10just because I could stand to see it again, if I didn't have to pay for it.
","In seeing this movie, I was robbed not only of fourteen dollars but of about two hours of my life. However, it was bearable because of the make up (some people looked so damn grimy I wanted to retch), costumes, and musicessentially everything save the actual script which was shamefully devoid of any creativity or substance. Perhaps after designing the creatures, costumes, sets and making the special effects, there simply wasn't enough to go around.<br/><br/>After leaving the theater I came to realization it was a really bad movie, but a really bad movie done well. My anger at not feeling as if came to any real conclusion subsided.<br/><br/>Praise must also go to all the actors, who weren't at fault as they turned in great performances. Depp manages to be hilariously and at times overly effeminate but still remain utterly desirable. Nighy is the man when it comes to playing 'and-he-wasn't-even-angry"" villains (Serious props to creature design and the make up departments) but my biggest praise must go to Naomie Harris. She was superb as the Island voodoo maven and I'm not easy to please, especially when I'm being bored to death by superfluous dialogue.<br/><br/>Go see it, if you'd like to appreciate everything but the actual spoken content. You really learn nothing strikingly new about any of the characters and it does not build to the dramatic cliff hanger they intend because despite his quirky and humorous nature, you find you might ask yourself about Depp's character.<br/><br/>What do any of the characters have to gain by getting Jack Sparrow back? He used them all, never caring for anyone but himself and yet, they resolve to march off to the end of the earth and save him yet again.<br/><br/>In all seriousness, they could have let this second installment take up a third of the next planned movie and called it a day."

Special effects, see, are *special* because you save them to make create a *special effect.* When you are looking at a special-effects, octopus face throughout much of a movie, it becomes ... less special.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy, who played Davy Jones, the character with the octopus on his face, can be a thrilling actor. He was riveting as an aging rock star in ""Love, Actually."" You couldn't take your eyes off him. And he didn't have an octopus on his face. He was just ... ACTING. *Acting* really well, from a *witty, surprising script,* that engaged him in *an interesting plot.* Gee ... could POTC take a clue from that? What difference do POTC:DMC's visually fabulous hamster-wheel stunt, or its fruit-kabob stunt make, if you don't have a coherent plot, built up through well written dialolgue, acted by characters you care about? Captain Jack Sparrow was such an endearing character in the first pirates; why was his character wasted in ""Dead Man's Chest""? Why did he have few to no scenes to develop this well beloved character? The movie pretty much ignores any effort to build up Elizabeth Swann's (Keira Knightly) or Will Turner's (Orlando Bloom)'s characters.<br/><br/>Oh, I know you're going to go see it. You know you're going to go see it. And no matter how many reviews this movie gets that criticize its complete failure to pay any attention at all to character, plot, and dialogue, it will make bazillions of dollars.<br/><br/>Which, in a sense, is a shame.

"EUyeshima","7","1","4","9 July 2006"," Shiver Me Timbers! Captain Jack Returns in a Lumbering Adventure That Improves in the Second Half
","Johnny Depp's preening cheekiness as Captain Jack Sparrow continues to be the invaluable glue that holds together this action-packed, over-the-top movie, the second in a trilogy inspired by the well-loved, nearly forty year-old ride in Disneyland. The jam-packed story picks up relatively soon after the point where the last one left off with spunky Elizabeth Swann about to marry adventurer Will Turner. Complications come in the form of British East India Trading Company's Lord Cutler Beckett, who charges the couple with conspiring to help Sparrow escape from the company's clutches. Death is their fate unless they can secure Sparrow's magical compass for Beckett. Sparrow has troubles of his own as he has sold his soul to the legendary dawn-of-the-dead pirate, Davy Jones, fabled captain of the Flying Dutchman, in exchange for the right to command his vessel, the Black Pearl. Sparrow's one option is to find the key to a chest containing Jones' still-beating heart.<br/><br/>The story lines eventually collide but not before the main characters run into a voodoo woman, Tia Dalma, full of mystical advice on how to get the key; Elizabeth's jilted swain, Commodore James Norrington, out for revenge against Will; Will's lost-soul father, Bootstrap Bill Turner, somewhere between life and death; and a mammoth, octopus-like sea monster named Kraker. After a shaky start with far too much exposition, director Gore Verbinski gets the momentum finally going in the second hour with heart-racing action escalating in both scope and absurdity, although screenwriters Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio tend to layer all the developments in a most convoluted manner. Despite the pacing problems, what I do like about the film is its persistently irreverent tone and the way death is treated not as the final end but as a relative inconvenience. From my perspective, this is what makes the movie's spirit come alive for a contemporary viewer.<br/><br/>Beyond Depp's devilishly clever performance, the real star is unsurprisingly the CGI-generated special effects, whether it's Jones and his ocean-morphed crew of half men/half sea creatures (the hammerhead shark is a particularly creepy figure to watch); Kraker and its engulfing destruction (though this gets repetitive in the story); or the variety of memorable action set pieces, such as the Black Pearl crew swinging in a ravine to escape their suspended spherical cages, or concurrently, Sparrow precariously maneuvering a pole where he inadvertently becomes part of a fruit shish kebob. My favorite set piece is the runaway waterwheel on the island where Will, Norrington and Sparrow are preoccupied with their swashbuckling and the search for the chest. The audacious silliness of these action sequences is what keeps the movie afloat.<br/><br/>Both Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom return from the first film as Elizabeth and Will. Looking beautiful, even disguised as a boy, Knightley has been promoted into more of an action role here and handles her part with aplomb. Bloom is still a relatively colorless presence but fulfills the heroic dimensions of the part almost by default. As Davy Jones, Bill Nighy is able to create an intriguing character underneath the CGI-generated visage of octopus tentacles, and in a tribute to Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"", has a great scene where he plays the numerous keys of a pipe organ all at once. Granted, at 150 minutes, the epic movie does run too long for the story it tells, and the lumbering series of climaxes seems excessive. Regardless, it's still grand fun thanks to Depp and the oozing, barnacle-encrusted realism of the CGI effects."

","The first Pirates was an excellent movie, and I was SO ready to love this film. Truly, they had an easy audience with me, as I was set to enjoy the film, no matter what. I simply couldn't imagine myself disliking it - and, on the whole, I didn't. It is a good movie and definitely worth seeing. However, I've got to sadly admit that I was a bit disappointed with the film. Really, the only problem with it was the storyline. The acting, the visuals, everything else was great, but the story was problematic. I understand that being the middle part of a trilogy automatically makes it a ""bridge"" film, but that doesn't mean that it couldn't have stood on its own. However, as they have written it, it is simply all a lead-in to the third film. Additionally, the story keeps moving from point A to B to C to D, and on and on, without any build-up or time to contemplate what's just happened - in other words, it's a bit confusing. I could, and would, readily forgive all that, but the major problem was, as another reviewer put it, the characters (and by that I, basically, mean Jack and Elizabeth) we knew from the first film aren't always present in the sequel. It's a much darker film, with Jack constantly betraying everyone, and I won't even make an attempt at explaining Elizabeth's behavior in this film that is so at odds with everything her character thought, felt, and displayed in the first Pirates. With that said, it was, nevertheless, a good film. It just doesn't live up to the original. However, I am hoping for redemption of characters and a return to the feeling of the first film in Pirates 3."

There were some OK parts in the movie but nothing that really catches my eye pardon the midget. When Jones played the organ I yelled at the screen ""Im going to kill you"" and then started a chant in the theatre that said ""Death"" over and over again. I thought it was tragic that Elizibeth betrays Jack in the end. I now want to rip her heart out in front of the midget and make him eat it. That organ scene basically ruined the movie for me and my fellow viewers. The midget luckily came back and saved the day better than superman.

The scenes were repeated and jokes became very, very old.

","I've only given this movie a 6 out of 10. Do not get me wrong, but I am totally in love with the way Johnny Depp portrays every character he plays, and he did fantastic with Jack. However, the movie was wrought with overzealous action scenes, such as the Kraken attacking the boat 3 times. A bit too much I think. It is not likely to earn any specific awards or outstanding achievements, but it is still a good movie to just chill out and watch. Also, I have never particularly liked the way Orlando Bloom acts, it's always stiff, with little facial emotion/expression, and it is hard for me to be enraptured by him, unlike Johnny. Though, Orlando did do significantly better this time around. Keira Knightley was quite good, yet I was disappointed in the little screen time she had. And I was completely and utterly surprised by what she did towards the end. Of course, I won't spoil it for the readers, but to me, not a very commendable attribute. I also thoroughly enjoyed watching Lord Beckett, played by Tom Hollander, because every time he spoke, I was reminded of his character Mr. Collins in the movie Pride and Prejudice. It's quite amusing to see such a small man play such strong characters. There were many times I laughed, but sometimes, the endless amount of hilarity was still a bit too much. But, even with it's torrent of clichéd jokes, it will become a classic, and I would recommend it to anyone. I heartily enjoyed many parts of this movie, and good healthy criticism never hurt anybody."

It was not as funny as the first. The interaction between Davy Jones and Capitan Jack was not as funny as with Barbosa. I hope with the third one that Jeffery Rush has more lines.

","Generally, I found this film to be a disappointment when compared to the first. However, it is difficult to top the Black Pearl... so, in its defense and in the understanding that a lot of work was put into ""Dead Man's Chest"", i gave it a 6. There were several aspects that i found disappointing, namely the amoral outcome of Commodore Norrington.<br/><br/>Norrington as a drunken ne'er do well, simply is not consistent with his personality in the first movie. The result of this unexplained downward spiral is that we now have a character that is not believable.<br/><br/>Elizabeth's sudden attraction to Sparrow is just short of ridiculous. The first film portrays Jack Sparrow's notion of romance between himself and Elizabeth as humorous in the sense that Elizabeth, in reality, was pretty much repulsed by him. This sudden change of feeling puts the second movie at odds with the first.<br/><br/>The special effects were exceptional, but there was little plot. There was endless violence and gore (mild) with no closure. Even a movie with a cliff-hanger ending requires a purpose for 2 1/2 hours of action. No matter how good the special effects are, the burden of appeal should not be placed solely on graphics. A gripping plot should have complimented the special effects.<br/><br/>I'll have to say that Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow redeemed the film. His quirkiness is always fresh and his performance was excellent."
"spartacus533","7","1","4","8 July 2006"," Yo Ho, Yo Ho, This Movie is real slow
","Just before I begin the critical analysis of this movie, I want to say that I have never been more excited about a movie before. The build-up, the poster campaign have all looked amazing, and when the soon-to-be-iconic Pirate theme began, I nestled in my seat for the bumnumbing 150 minutes ahead of me. The movie starts well, with a distraught Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) looking pouty as her wedding has just been ruined by the arrest of her fiancée, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom). The next shot is of a rather scary looking island, with some rather scary looking men throwing coffins into the sea. The camera focuses on a bird ontop of one of the coffins, the birdie gets blown up by the gun of, none other, than Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). Already, my criticism for the movie has begun; Gore Verbinski and Jerry B. were obviously too worried about the effects to bother with a story, which, unfortunately, can't hold a candle to the first film, The Curse of the Black Pearl. The film suffers from several problems, the first being something I like to call ""The League of Xtraordinary Gentlemen"" syndrome. It has a great premise, but can't carry it off due to a disappointing narrative drive. The film jumps from scene to scene unflatteringly, for example, one minute Jack is aboard his ship, having a ghastly encounter with Bootstrap Bill Turner, the next he is on an island being praised as a god by island natives. The writers have also unnecessarily added in some characters killed off in the first one, Pintell and Ragatti are back for more, with none of the ""good guys"" a.k.a Gibbs or Sparrow himself giving the blind bit of notice to the fact that just a while before they had been fighting them off in Curse of the Black Pearl. Characters come and go, plot holes leave gaping craters in a movie that should have been every bit as good as it's predecessor. The film is a bit of a mess. But it is a visually stunning, and at times, breath-taking mess. For every boring scene, for every cringeworthy piece of acting, there is a fast-paced action scene. But some of them just don't work. For example, the Kraken scene goes on too long and not enough happens, whereas a bar brawl in Tortuga, while being hilarious at times, has too much happening at once to really capture your interest. There is also a scene in which a hungover Norrington, Sparrow and Turner fight it out on a picturesque beach. Although it unravels into a thrilling sequence, it starts off really quite shoddy and boring. I imagine you could stage a better fight down at your local. All-in-all, I left the cinema not knowing what to think. While it had been boring at times, it had been really quite amazing at times. I can't help wondering if I wanted to like it.<br/><br/>Verdict: When it's slow it's slooooooooow, and the plot tends to cave in at times. But Depp holds his ground, and I'm licking my lips for Pirates 3. But I can't help but wonder if it's going to turn out like the Matrix... ***/*****"

I was glad to see the return of Norrington and some of the memorable crew members too like the first mate, the hamburger and hot dog pirates (the short fat guy and the tall skinny one with one eye. I don't remember their names but they remind me of an old Bugs Bunny cartoon in which two marooned sailors get so hungry that the each hallucinate that the other one is a hamburger/hot dog), and Barbossa makes a come back at the very end.<br/><br/>I just like how in this movie, through dialog the possibly confusing parts of the plot are all explained. You gotta like movies that do that for you. One confused character takes on your confusion and asks another character of the plot specifics. Anyways, getting side-tracked. You still have the same antagonists. On one side there are the evil and unholy type of undead pirates, on the other side there is the British Empire presenting another obstacle. And in the middle you have Jack and his crew and Will and Elizabeth. Jack and his crew trying to protect a treasure of some kind and Will and Elizabeth trying to protect each other. But they all get mixed up together again and need each other to get what they want.<br/><br/>Jack's compass was an interesting aspect too. Pointing out what the characters wanted most. I liked the little side plot too between Elizabeth and Jack.They were supposed to be the antithesis of one another. Through Elizabeth, Jack was able to be a hero and save the lives of the rest of the crew. And through Jack, Elizabeth was able to let go and do something ""bad"", or finally become a ""pirate"" like Jack calls her at the end. At first the plot flirted with a possible romantic interplay between the two when the compass she held pointed at Jack. It seems that he more represented her need to show her bad side or in another way, her path to saving Will. Nice twist.<br/><br/>Of course, Orlando Bloom and Johnny Depp are F.I.N.E.-fine! You cab't go wrong with that kind of eye candy. (give me Johnny Depp any day of the week!)<br/><br/>And the ending is a huge cliffhanger! It will go right into the third movie. Nothing gets resolved at the end of this movie. We have to wait until the next one to find out how things play out. Which is cool because a lot of movies flop if they try at a third storyline. I feel bad for people who can't just enjoy movies like this and feel the need to compare everything to real life. It's a fantasy/mythological story. It isn't supposed to be real."
"Foreverest","10","1","4","7 July 2006"," It's What I've Been Waiting For...
","I have been sitting around for the past few months, not being able to keep the new movie off my mind. Oh my gosh! Pirates of the Caribbean! Everyone is squirming in there seats now.. they only have to wait three months. But the question was, will it really be THAT great? Finally. The day comes and we're off to the theaters the minute we wake up.<br/><br/>When the movie starts, hope will slowly start to shave off you. You're not too sure it's going to satisfy you like you hoped, but you continue to watch and give it a shot.<br/><br/>And you leave the theater satisfied.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man's Chest is an amazing and epic sequel to The Curse of the Black Pearl. The movie is just as good as the first, if not better. After watching Dead Man's Chest, I've already made plans to see the final edition of trilogy.<br/><br/>The movie is quite long, but nonetheless entertaining. I've seen three to five hour long movies that just seem to drag on at incredibly slow rates. You sit there through some parts that seem to have no point and are unable to contribute to the main point. This film, however, will keep you locked in your chair, whether or not your body needs a restroom break.<br/><br/>The new edition is better than the first, in my opinion. More imagination is thrown in and stronger characters are delivered by the cast. More humorous and suspenseful than the first, and the animation is wonderful.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest IS what you've been waiting for. It IS the super sequel to the super hit, The Curse of the Black Pearl. It WILL satisfy your lust for another insane and epic adventure with humorous Captain Jack Sparrow, trustworthy William Turner, and bold Elizabeth Swann. Of course, we can't forget about all the other incredible characters.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest won't let you down. Get ready to view the sequel you've desired for so long.<br/><br/>Excellent. A ten out of ten."
"sweetnspoiledxo","10","1","4","7 July 2006"," How could it end like this???...I loved it though
","I saw it the first movie that came out today. I loved the movie. It was scary-sad-happy-adventurous-funny. It wasn't just some boring movie that makes you upset or overdoes the humor. I also personally loved the humor in it like the whole thing with the ""omg Jack, you were telling the truth."" ""I usually do that love, but every time i do people are surprised..."" ""For a good reason too...."" <br/><br/>What I was upset with it how it just ended....i was not expecting it to be over. it kinda felt really bad and everyone in the movies were upset. You did not know what happened to jack. Also the guy who came down was bad in #1 so he will probably deceive them. I do not know how liz felt and what was up between jack and liz. There was no connection between will and liz in the sequel. Well i don't care bec. i love orlando! well overall it was my fave movie ever!!!! but upset to wait another year to see what happens"
"RaNDoMxGeSTuReS","10","1","4","7 July 2006"," End Credits
","This is the best movie I have seen all summer. There are quite of few sword fights that make you think ""Count of Monte Cristo"". But it's not all action in this movie there is plenty of story to munch down on. The use of foreshadowing in this film is just extraordinary. You think something is going to happen, but ironically another thing does. If you have ever seen Disney's ""Tron"" you may be familiar with this film element. The ending leaves you hanging for the third film it keeps you coming back for more. Honestly, I couldn't finish my popcorn and soda because this film kept me on the edge of my seat. (Yes, it was that exciting)Anything with Buena Vista is awesome. Wait until after the credits people. There is an extra scene. Pay close attention to the movie and it'll mean a lot to you."
"madog0on-1","10","1","4","7 July 2006"," Excellent
","This movie is great fun. It is exciting and funny. It's also scary and a lot darker than the first movie. It's not for young children, with great CGI of pirates and beasties. It's a better story than the first film. It's great entertainment and serves as a great setup for the next film. There are surprises throughout the film and the director saves the best for last. Go see it and have a good time. If you're expecting high culture stay away -- but if you're looking for a rollicking good time, go see it. The only way you won't enjoy this movie is if your heart is in Davy Jones' locker (along with his sweat socks (with a nod to Sponge Bob))."
"jeromecusson","7","1","4","7 July 2006"," The Best Summer Movie of '06
","What other summer movies have tried and failed, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest succeeds. Maybe the plot is a bit convoluted and the characters not all that well developed, but for pure action and adventure, I promise you won't find a better swashbuckling adventure.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, in his first ever sequel, plays Jack Sparrow as well as he did in the first movie. Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightly are much improved from the last movie even though they at times may come off a little grating. The CGI on Davy Jones is quite good and the supporting cast in this movie does a great job supporting the main characters, despite how absurd the situations get.<br/><br/>Much like other second movies, this film tends to get darker and a lot less humor is incorpotated. What this film does have is some great action sequences, some good special effects, and a twist ending that will make you circle the date of when the third movie comes out."
"mrforgetful","7","1","4","7 July 2006"," mixed bag
","Like any other viewer anticipating the sequel of one of their favorite movies, I entered the midnight showing of POTC:DMC with high hopes. And why shouldn't I? The first in the series was such a delightful combination of swashbuckling action, crisp comic relief, and rousing musical cues.<br/><br/>With that said, the sequel tries to top all those but save for the action part, fails. While including some new jokes, the movie's humor becomes too dependent on references to the first film. For instance, there were about 3 too many ""rum"" jokes. By now, the jokes have become stale and no fun anymore. The timing of the comic relief is another issue. Comic relief works best when its ""relief"" from the drama and action happening in the story....hence the term. It's entirely too prominent in some areas and loses its effect when it should heighten the entertainment value of the film.<br/><br/>Geoffrey Rush as Captain Barbossa was a far better villain than Davy Jones, who was horribly underdeveloped and had no personality. He was just...there. ""I'm mean because I have a squid for a head."" He was cool to look at, but didn't say too many interesting things, unlike Barbossa whose banter with Jack Sparrow was one of the highlights of the first film.<br/><br/>Speaking of the main character, I was trying to explain to a friend why I didn't appreciate this movie as much as the first. It's simply because in the first one, no one expected Captain Jack Sparrow to be the instantly memorable icon that he is now, and now that the mystery of the character is solved, and now that we've seen what he can do, it seems like there's nothing new he can tell us. He can say some funny lines, stretch his face to the limits, but there's not much Johnny Depp can do to further his character's charm.<br/><br/>There were some improvements over the first movie. It has more of a ""pirate-y"" feel. The special effects look decidedly less hokey than the first, and the effects with the Kraken are particularly impressive. There are also some extremely inventive sword fight scenes, including one involving a giant wheel.<br/><br/>With too many subplots, the story becomes tangled until you wish the movie had more forward direction. You finally get to the end, which includes and extremely out of character decision by one of the main characters, an abrupt finale, and a major cliffhanger. It sets up for a spectacular 3rd installment, but hopefully next time there will be less subplots, leaving room for the expertly timed wit and story progression that was so masterfully handled in the first movie."
"mathematicalprofessor","6","1","4","7 July 2006"," I would Recommend it
","This was well made and well written with the exception of the plot. The movie was littered of sub-plots, and this wouldn't be a big deal if there was a strong tie between them, but this was lacking. The movie is better than Curse of the Black Pearl, but is darker. Also, if you enjoy long movies, this is for you. <br/><br/>The film is one of surprises and tense scenes, rather surprising from a Disney movie. The film is also rather dynamic, and quite expansive on the geography, which gives the feel for these pirates because you feel you've sailed the same waters that they have. The beauty of this is that, to some degree, you can choose a character to make a reference from and you still get the same experience from another character. <br/><br/>Overall, I would recommend it."
"pooandglue","7","1","4","7 July 2006"," Not bad, but too long, and over the top
","As a large fan of the original movie, I was pretty excited to see this sequel when it came out. A large group of friends and I attended the midnight release, and overall we were a bit disappointed.<br/><br/>It is my personal opinion of the first pirates movie that had Johnny Depp not been cast as Captain Jack Sparrow, it would have been abysmal. It was his incredible acting talent that made the first one the success. And while the swashbuckling, makeup-wearing captain is one of the most alluring factors of Dead Man's Chest; I believe he was unable to overcome the shortcomings of the second movie as he did in the first.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest did three things I'm sick of Hollywood doing: 1) Relied too much on popular actors to draw crowds; 2) Went with a plot driven by lots of action and special effects, while attempting to mask a poor storyline; and 3) In typical trilogy fashion, sacrificed a decent ending in exchange for setting up the next movie.<br/><br/>While granted, this movie is going to make an enormous amount of money at the box office, most likely more than the first, that doesn't make it a better movie. There were too many sequences that were simply outrageous - the bone prison rolling down hills; the multiple fights against the giant squid thing; the entire fight sequence over the chest and how everyone ends up in the same place (how convenient).<br/><br/>Not only did I find myself checking my watch on multiple occasions, I noticed a large amount of people doing the same throughout the movie. While other movies of extreme length are done so to fit in a large amount of plot in a small out of time (i.e. LOTR), Pirates 2 has too many sequences that are simply too long and drawn out. One particular scene that angered me was the fight sequence between Depp, Bloom and Davenport (Norrington). During this fight, Knightley does nothing but kick and scream like a typical female, which is nothing like the strong and independent Swann we saw in the first and most of the second movie.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was entertaining and fun to watch, but unlike the first one, I don't plan on seeing this again until it comes out on DVD."
"kevinsavejs","8","1","4","6 July 2006"," Great Movie Tons of Laughs
","I went to the Midnight showing of Pirates tonight and let me tell you the movie was great. It had everything you would expect in a sequel. The fight scenes were really intense and the creativity put into them showed. The movie was full of laughs as Jack (Depp) has you laughing the entire time. Depp really makes the movie and he single handedly stole the show. As the ad's says jacks back and thats exactly the truth. If you enjoyed the first movie you will be sure to love this one. Though i do suggest that you watch the first one before you go because if you are like me and haven't seen the first one in a while you wont pick up on certain things. The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger and it leads you right into the third movie which looks to follow the lead of the first two into the great movie spotlight. It has some big shoes to fill. I gave it a 10 because it gave me everything i was looking for and more. I can honestly say this movie is funnier than some of the comedies i have seen in the past few years. So head to your local theater I'm sure you will not be disappointed it is a grade a film."
"alanhaworth-1","9","1","4","6 July 2006"," Depp's Captain Jack is back
","A miserable winter's day in Melbourne Australia has just received the ""rays"" required to warm the cockles of this city's heart! Johnny Depp has arrived to deliver another dose of pure entertainment in the role of Captain Jack Sparrow. The story is strong, the visuals are great, the rest of the cast is as strong as in the original ... but above all else, there's one major reason for this film and its predecessor's success ... JOHNNY DEPP. If Depp is not thoroughly enjoying every single moment of playing this character, then he is the greatest actor of all-time. His antics, from the swishing of his pirate hips, to the mischievous glint in his eye, all make the film a joy to behold. For those in need of a really good laugh, and a voyage full of fantasy and fun, then set sail now for a ride on the Black Pearl - you will not regret it."
"huckinsgirl","9","1","4","6 July 2006"," Incredible movie
","The director did an incredible job making it different and stand out from the first one. Greed, deception, disloyalty, arrests were all part of the movie. The movie certainly won't be what you were expecting but will still be incredible. Dead Man's Chest was a more edgy and dark than the first one. The director took it and made in worth the PG-13 rating. This movie was awesome. The effects were terrific. It didn't seem like it was all computer generated and that it was really fake. The plot line was good and the tied everything together really well. Also there were funny parts and some parts that at least made me jump. Overall this movie was terrific and I recommend that anyone who saw the first one and liked it should see this one."
"mdud","9","1","4","6 July 2006"," Breathtaking
","I loved this film.<br/><br/>Okay, comparisons with The Empire Strikes Back are obvious but it was different enough from it to stand on its own.<br/><br/>The twists and turns that it takes are mostly brilliant and there are a few bigger twists that I can only recommend you don't read about beforehand! In this day and age, that can be fairly difficult I know but you'll be better off for it.<br/><br/>Lastly, the special effects weren't as good as I thought they could be but it didn't detract from Mr Depp's stand out performance. I simply cannot wait until the next one.<br/><br/>Oh, stay until after the credits, there's a small scene which amuses - however if, like me, you were in a packed boiling hot cinema on a hot summers day then you won't miss that much by leaving at the regular time."
"nikki_wiggle","10","1","4","6 July 2006"," This is fantastic!
","I have just seen this film! and it rocks! Johnny gives an even better performance (and we all thought it wasn't possible!) as Captain Jack, he lights up the screen with his slightly effeminate character. Some scenes are a bit far fetched, but as a whole, the story is good, though the ending is a puzzle. Although Bill Nighy is completely unrecognisable, you can still see the movements and hear the speech of him. Orlando Bloom is dashing, but slightly overacting, although there is a scene where you could really see the pain in his eyes. Keira Knightley is stunning as always, and you just have to hate her (you will see why). All round this is a fabulous film and should be seen and enjoyed by all!"
"johnny_ultimate","7","1","4","6 July 2006"," Decent sequel
","I'm a huge fan of the first ""pirates"", because it was just a helluva lot of fun. Luckily the sequel retains the sense of fun of the prequel. However, it lacks the surprise the unexpectedly brilliant first did. That's not to say that this is a poor film. Not at all. Indeed, the central action sequences (the island escape near the beginning and the climatic big wheel sequence especially) are terrific, with an excellent sense of humor that had me laughing out loud, to use that annoying internet phrase. The CGI is excellent, especially Davy Jones himself. And of course, Johnny Depp. What can I say, this man deserves an Oscar for his wonderfully campy Captain Jack - he was so cruelly denied one first time around.<br/><br/>Yet this film is not perfect. The film begins very slowly indeed, taking a good half hour to really kick off, with some confusing plot strands required to set up sequences of events (indeed, the whole cast is not reunited until well past halfway into the film). Yet the major problem lies in the poor casting of Orlando Bloom, whose quite frankly irritating hero struggles to hold the screen when Capn Jack is absent.<br/><br/>Overall however, this is a fine film. The surprisingly lengthy running time flies by, and Pirates is many times more enjoyable than 90% of other blockbusters due to it's sense of humor, style and fun. I must admit I'm looking forward to chapter three of this continuing quality franchise."
"gavinmacuk","10","1","4","6 July 2006"," wow
","wow, this movie was amazing, the action and adventure that is packed in to it. I loved how all the old cast was back like the two pirate goons ragetti and pintel and Norrington. I was a little surprised that Jack Sparrow died, i expected the octopus to spit him back out. Plus Keira the bitch who actually chained him to the black pearl and left him for dead. Barbossa is back of course i knew it were him for a reason when i saw his boats before and then crazy monkey ran up to him. Don't know how he survived. He was shot in the heart , but there will be a reason in the third film, but the ending was a real shock and surprise. Loved the film all together, would see it over and over again. A must see film."
"naomi-manuel","9","1","4","6 July 2006"," *Still Superbly Swashbuckling*
","I originally thought it would be impossible for this film to be better than the first Pirates film , but I have to admit, this sequel isn't half bad! In fact, my only criticism would be having such a cliff-hanger ending that I don't think I can wait until the third film appears in cinemas! The soundtrack is pretty much the same in this film as in the first, truly amazing! The actors and actresses maintain the exceptional performance witnessed in the first film and the plot is not too complicated! There was a stage about two hours into the film when quite a lot of people in the cinema became restless possibly suggesting that this film drags out slightly, but then this film requires the extra time to fit the entire plot in without giving a rushed feeling. Amazing sequences successfully combine comedy with action. This film has some of the funniest lines I've ever heard, most of them coming from the obvious source of Jack Sparrow. This film isn't quite a laugh a minute, but there are certainly enough funny moments to keep the viewer's attention.<br/><br/>As tempting as it is to give away spoilers in huge quantity, I will resist and simply urge all Pirate fans to ignore the criticisms made by some critics go and see this in the cinema - it's one hundred percent worth it!"
"dermotkeogh","9","1","4","6 July 2006"," All hail Captain Jack Sparrow......
","Finally one of the Summer blockbusters that lives up to the hype. Contining on from the excitement and hilarity of ""The Curse Of The black Pearl"", ""Dead mans Chest"" steps up a gear to give you more of what you want. The plot is not all over the place as some have said and to be honest if you're a fan of the first you wont really care. I must say it has been a while since I enjoyed a movie this much. It has great gags,great action set pieces, great special effects, some nice plot twists and a very exciting story. Once again Johnny Depp steals every scene he is in(check him out legging it from some cannibals) but that is not a bad thing. Even the academy agrees that Jack Sparrow is a great character.

"johnc-63","8","1","4","6 July 2006"," Haven't I been on this ride before? Typical Bruckheimer movie. Still lots of fun. No closure!!!!
","My wife works at the theater and we got to preview the movie last night before it came out. Luckily, we were the only ones in there so my focus could be on the movie and not the loud obnoxious guy behind me. This movie can't be summed up in a word or sentence. There is too much. I felt like my head was spinning after the show because this movie has no closure at all! I saw another comment that this is the Empire strikes back of its day but really its more like back to the future 2. The first one rocks and leaves plenty of room to make a sequel. Because the director and Bruckheimer know it rocked, they know they have the opportunity to turn this into such a large sequel, that it takes two movies to finish telling the story. I knew they were planning a third movie, but I didn't know it was the second half of dead mans chest. <br/><br/>First, the cast and Jerry Bruckheimer are all first class acts so you know you can expect a fast paced action packed adventure. This movie delivers exactly that. Johnny Depp is well, himself so thats great! Kiera Knightly is slowly growing on me as her acting is improving and her looks make up for the slack. Orlando I must say is finally starting to make a decent actor. (Or maybe I'm just getting used to the way he acts). The rest of the cast is rather great. <br/><br/>The movie is action packed, doesn't drag, even for a 2 1/2 hr movie, its funny and wonderfully entertaining. <br/><br/>The frustrating part is the movie is kinda too deep in the storyline and nothing is explained. A British tyrant ruins the turner wedding, threatens death just to lure them both to get (capt.)Jack Sparrow's compass that originally was thought to steer him to the treasure from the BP. When in fact, it steers you to your greatest desires. So why does Jack have trouble using it and needs help to find what he desires? Apparently hes not sure that is what he desires most. There's a connection with the British tyrant and Jack that is'nt explained. We have no idea what purpose the tyrant wants with the treasure of Davy Jones, We learn very little about Davy Jones and his crew and why they are a cursed group of sea creatures and talking reef's. Why, if certain people are supposed to have died or had been cursed from BP, why they are back in this movie. (like the monkey, as well as others.)There also seems to be a forming love triangle beginning to develop between Jack,Liz, and Will that only complicates the plot.<br/><br/>Overall, I was happy and thought the special effects were awesome, especially the Kraken! Not a movie for little kids. There are too many grotesque scenes. Unfortunately too many other areas of the plot that I haven't mentioned are also leaving you hanging and you have to wait a whole year to find out, the rest of the story!!!!! Obviously that was the point."
"computerguru3190","10","1","4","6 July 2006"," Saw it early
","I got to see this movie early for a special employee screening. It was awesome! We loved it so much we watched twice and then were acting out scenes as we left the theatre. The movie is awesome, Sparrow plays his great, having that just right mix of evil and good to complement his character.<br/><br/>Some parts are a little scary if you are with young children or skittish people. Some things jump out and some characters are kind of scary for little kids. Overall it wasn't to bad, but a little graphic in the violence.<br/><br/>The acting was great and you had to love Knightley in this movie. I would pay to see this movie again as I loved it so much. Depp just makes you loves his character toward the end even more than usual.<br/><br/>Only thing i didn't like was that if you didn't see the first movie you would be a little confused."

","Fun film! Sure it slips in quite a few areas, but its visuals are so eye-popping that I didn't care. (: Johnny Depp shines again as Jack Sparrow; giving us quite a few laughs through the duration of the film. The humor chemistry between Orlando Bloom and Depp is just perfect in my opinion. There is something about Bloom's awkward innocence and Depp's awkward awkwardness that makes this film much more special than it would otherwise have been. 8 out of 10 feels just right. 3 for Depp's acting + 3 for visuals + 2 for humor. I hope that you decide to check this film out if you haven't already. The critics were mixed on it, which is highly understandable, but I forgave the flaws. Beautiful visuals get me every time Now for comparison: Yes, the first film is better. I think Geoffrey Rush is the reason that film floats above this one. He is so magnificent!"

I saw this first in the movies. I loved it I was shocked at the suspense. Johnny Depp is like, almost the best pirate there is. ELizabeth Swann/Keira Knightley looks more appropriate in this movie. Will turner/Orlando Bloom has yet again succeeded in a great role. The ending is great and I liked it a lot. This could be the best Pirates of the Caribbean movie yet to come.

","Disney has a penchant for ruining sequels and follow-ups to movies. This is not one of those times. Disney doesn't always mess up. (That's a big surprise!) Dead Man's Chest deals with the search for Davy Jones and a missing key to a chest, but no one knows what key or what chest. I enjoyed the characterizations and the casting was impeccable. Cinematography and special effects are very much on par with the first Pirates of the Caribbean. You must see the first one before you see this one. Otherwise, all the references to the first movie will be over your head. Don't worry about that, though. The first one was great. Enjoy this one with your kids (might want to view it first for violence and some adult situations.) It was great to see the actors from the first movie repeat their performances in this one. I'm looking forward to the 3rd (and final?) Caribbean when it comes out in May 2007. Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance again! I hope they can carry this on to the final one."

Can't hear any more actors' ""oh oh""s or ""oops""...<br/><br/>The storyboard also spent way too much time and distracted the story on CGI sequences. These are so boring to watch... Where have all the stunt men gone? Ignoring laws of physics so trite and obviously in CGI ""stunt"" scenes really drops me off the movie. I was rather impressed that there was a ""real"" watermill scene indeed in the movie showing *real* actors in action for... was it half a second?<br/><br/>After all, almost every character from the first movie had a reprise.

And all the dazzling effects? -- So what?! I mean the effect on Davy Jones face was pretty amazing but after awhile I got sick of looking at it. It became merely disgusting! Johnny Depp's mannerisms in this movie are more affected than the first one -- I mean now he's kinda mincing when he walks and waves his arms around -- he's more effete and more caricature. I got sick of looking at him too -- which is amazing because he's one of my favorite actors. And after all this... they can't even come up with an ending. It's more like a last minute cliffhanger. And it's a lousy one, because I just don't care. I should be made to care by the story craft, but nope. It's just a prelude to #3 to soak us out of our dollars. What a waste of time.

","I enjoyed this silly and nonsensical movie almost as much as the first one except for the new storyline where Elizabeth Swann falls in love with Jack Sparrow. Jack is a fine dashing comic figure and the center of the movie, but does anyone really want to have sex with him unless you have a dirt fetish as well? Are the writers nuts, or do they really think that women are sexually attracted to bad teeth, dirty fingernails and a grand mincing manner that Quentin Crisp must be envying from the grave? When Elizabeth appears to prefer Jack to the loyal Will Turner, played by the unspeakably gorgeous Orlando Bloom, the moment is jarring and repellent, not funny or romantic. I certainly lost sympathy for Elizabeth in those last minutes, when her behavior made her seem both faithless and downright nutty. I can only hope that the next film corrects this, for her character's butch and moral spunkiness was charming in the first film, and Jack Sparrow should really remain the bizarre, addled, egocentric, unreformed, and unattached pirate that he is."
"henningjg-hum","5","1","5","8 August 2006"," Publicity stunt
","I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest yesterday, and though the movie wasn't horrible, I was disappointed. It is obvious that this was just a publicity stunt to draw people to the third instalment of Pirates. I feel that it was unnecessary - they could just have made one movie combining the story lines from Pirates 2 and 3. Honestly, the movie just seemed too long and I feel that the movie didn't justify the hype. I felt cheated at the end of the movie when I realised that DMC was just a prelude to Pirates: 3 and that the story had no real substance, plot or character development. It's the same as it was with Kill Bill - one feels that one has been cheated by being made to wait for the final instalment. All in all, the movie was okay - some entertaining moments and some awesome CGI - but I feel it unnecessary to make movie goers pay for two separate films that could (and should) have been one movie."
"jaredmobarak","8","1","5","22 July 2006"," Hide the rum
","Disney hit gold figuratively and literally in 2003 with a successful theme park ride adaptation. (While I loved the movie, please don't get me started on the whole adding Jack Sparrow to the attractions in Florida and California, thus ruining tradition and memories of childhoodit just hurts too much.) In the world of Hollywood today, we all knew that that success would lead to a franchise. It's a good thing that the filmmakers seemed to of had the same amount of fun as the audience because they are all back for more. People shouldn't be misinformed about this movie either, as it is the first part of a simultaneously shot two sequel setwhich one should know if they have turned on a television set these past two years, however, with the grumblings of ""I can't believe I paid 7 bucks for a trailer"" by theatergoers after my screening, maybe reality TV really is ruining our youth. Anyways, the film does not have a clear-cut ending, but instead a fantastic cliffhanger for the next installment. Believe me now; if it's as fun and entertaining as this one, we are in for a fantastic trilogy.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is back embodying the pirate we love most. All his eccentricities are there along with the sharp wit and sarcasm. He plays off Orlando Bloom's Will and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth deftly and surely with amusing banter and bickering between the three. There are times when Bloom and Knightley falter, he not really impressing me in much other than the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Kingdom of Heaven and her lapsing in parts where her reaction shots seem like she has broken character and is just slyly smiling at those speaking to her like it was a dead take. Depp however never breaks stride and proves once again to be the best character actor in Hollywood despite everyone's desire to make him a leading man. His search for the key to the ""Dead Man's Chest"" again leads Jack along to save himself from revenge by those he's betrayed, while also leading him on a path to have an opportunity of redeeming himself and proving his friends' thin faith that his heart is true as warranted.<br/><br/>The supporting players do a wonderful job throughout the film as well. Stellan Skarsgård is great as ""Bootstrap"" Bill, Bloom's Will's father. Actors like him bring credibility to an adventure movie, as this performance proves. While brief, he plays an integral part to the plot and surely will have more screen time in the third film. Jack Davenport shows some range as a beaten man looking for redemption, a welcome contrast to his confident and regal Commodore Norrington from the Curse of the Black Pearl. It's a shame he isn't used more in US cinema as he always gives a good performance; we always have his British work like the seldom seen stateside, but quite good miniseries, ""Ultraviolet."" The fight scene between Depp, Davenport, and Bloom is a highlight of the film and never grows old, even when it appears like it should. Naomie Harris also does a nice job as the creepy, otherworldly mystic our band of pirates seek wisdom from. Our real-scenestealer, however, is Bill Nighy as the villain Davy Jones. Even under the massive amounts of CGI animation, we are still given a brilliant performance. All his facial ticks and expressions are apparent and even if one didn't recognize his voice, you could still tell who is playing him. Anyone who has seen him in Shaun of the Dead and especially Underworld, where he plays his vampire Viktor much the same way as Jones here, will know what I mean.<br/><br/>As far as the effects go, the CGI is almost impeccable. The work done on the crew of the Flying Dutchman is amazing, with each actor having computer work mapped over their bodies. The sea-life textures are realistic and rival the effects work done on the cursed crew from the first film. Even the monstrous Kraken is rendered well. There are instances where it appears a tad cartoonish wrapping it's tentacles around ships, but the detail and sliminess of them close up is nice. One scene in particular is bad though, where a character towards the end faces the mouth of the monster. Our view is from behind the person looking at the gaping orifice, to see a flat wall. The feel is totally of a green screen as all sense of depth is dissolved. This instance is salvaged almost instantly, though, by the next cut, to a three- quarters view, where we are allowed to see the tentacles and teeth in defined planes of perspective in relation to the character, resulting in one of the best computer generated shots of the movie.<br/><br/>Even though Dead Man's Chest does get darker and more gruesome than its' predecessor, director Gore Verbinski and his writing team retain everything from the original that worked and begin to build upon it. While one can't really judge this film quite yet without seeing the finale that awaits, it is still obvious that it delivers on all its promises. We are treated with an entertaining adventure film with all the trimmings: great acting, great writing, humor, romance, and superbly choreographed swashbucklin' action. It all culminates with an appropriately surprising cameo appearance, readying us and whetting our appetite for At World's End in May of next year."
"hopsond","9","1","5","16 July 2006"," Excellent Film, but number 1 is better!!
","Personally I think that the film is too dark with more zombies and monsters (not spoiler! is in trailer!!) and has less of Jack Sparrow's humour i LOOOVE from Black Pearl! But is still good, expect to be scared, and to jump, and to cry and to laugh and to cry again! i was not gonna spoil but.... JACK GETS EATEN...... NOOOO BOOHOOO! CRY ALERT!! hehehehe!! Knightley and Blooms attempts at acting are funny, but they are still good although you hardly see Knightley at first, but she and Bloom are vital to the plot, like Black Pearl! Dead Mans chest brings back characters thought to be dead!! Bootstraps Bill Turner (Will Turners Father) who is not eh Flying Dutchman under the captaincy of Davey Jones, and BARBOSSA who is to help bring Jack back to life (eating apples1!!!) It sets the scene for Number 3 (AT WORLDS END) perfectly and all questions from Black Pearl are answered! EXCELLENT FILM!!"

"nickelpickle8","10","1","5","13 July 2006"," Surprisingly better than the first
","From the beginning this movie excited me. Jack Sparrow is as witty and clever as ever, and Will Turner is just as captivating. Elizabeth surprised me a lot in this movie, she's grown up a lot since the first Pirates of the Caribbean and is becoming almost as clever as Jack. And let's not leave out the great humor, this movie was rank with it, just as perhaps better than, the first movie. This movie never had me bored and always anticipating what would come next. It's a movie for all ages. And the special effects in this movie were fantastic. I can honestly say this isn't just the best movie of the summer but the best movie of the year. I've seen it twice in theaters so far and plan to go back and see it again, only because it's just as captivating and FUN. You'll leave the theater glad that you came, happy that finally you spent your money wisely lol. It's a movie that will never be forgotten. I can't wait until next year's third movie, and after you see it either will you."
"pendragon-14","10","1","5","13 July 2006"," Better than the first!
","It's ten times funnier than the first one. Better action and the best ending i've seen. I think they set it up perfectly. Right at the ending they leave a huge cliffhanger. There are so many ends left untied. Such as Beccet having Davy Jones's heart, Davy Jones is still alive,Bootstrap is still on the flying dutchman, Barbossa's back, is there a romance between Elizibeth and Jack (I hope so!),What about Tia is she Davy Jone's ex or Jack's ex,and then the endless possibilities about Jack, (just to name a few). As much as I love the first one I like Dead man's chest more. Right as they role the credits you think ""I can't wait to see the next one."" ""Wheres my jar of dirt?""- Jack Sparrow"
"sarastro7","7","1","5","13 July 2006"," A worthy follow-up
","I went to the premiere Danish showing of this movie, and for a noon show it was remarkably well attended (Copenhagen's biggest theater, probably 75-80% full). I hoped the movie would be at least as good as the first one, and in fact it was. Not better, nor a terribly memorable movie; not much to think about after it ended, but while it lasted it was very funny and enjoyable - a worthy follow-up to the original.<br/><br/>Well, one thing to think about might be the subplot about Elizabeth really being more interested in Jack than in Will... but we'll have to wait until the next movie to see if there's some real meat on that hook.<br/><br/>I did think this movie was a bit too long. It had many great scenes and sequences, but at 150 minutes there were also some passages that were too long and boring. But it did have a lot of details, which was good.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp was of course the spice of the movie, while Bloom and Knightley, as in the original, were adequate. Not great, not bad, but all right. Jonathan Pryce was good (as he always is), and I did wonder if Davy Jones was actually played by someone, or if he was fully CGI. Turns out he was being played by another brilliant Brit, Bill Nighy (hell, what would Hollywood do without all the British acting talent?!), which explains why he was so good.<br/><br/>Next movie, I'm primarily looking forward to the return of Geoffrey Rush's character - and another generous helping of Johnny Depp's inimitable Jack Sparrow, of course!<br/><br/>A pirate's life for me! Nah, not really! :-)<br/><br/>My rating: 8 out of 10. Same as the first."
"tangyfishlips","7","1","5","8 July 2006"," Pirates 2: The Overall Disappointment
","My overall opinion to the sequel of Pirates of the Caribbean was disappointment. For most people it was hard to follow along with the plot and with what was actually happening (it was hard to write my plot summary, I didn't even know where to start). The thing that I liked most about the first one was its witty humor. This one had its moments, but they were sub par and it seemed like they didn't have enough oomph. The one part that I thought still held up to the first one with the kind of humor it had was near the very begging of the movie when Jack was in that coffin floating off to the sea and the crow starts pecking at the coffin. The audience hears a gunshot from the inside of the coffin that kills the crow. Jack opens up the coffin and then uses a skeletal leg (which was a little disgusting) and starts rowing with it out to sea. That was classic, but nothing else stuck out for me in that kind of way.<br/><br/>In place of the witty humor they put in many battle slash action scenes. I'm fine with that, but it seemed a little too overdone. There were many times that I thought the character had to have been dead because how could they have survived that fall or been able to roll around in a ""water wheel"" (or whatever those things are called). The first ""octopus"" (I could never really hear what that thing was called) scene seemed to be fake. The arms of it didn't have the right lighting and they had that soft animation look to it. As the movie progressed it looked more real (unless I just got used to it).<br/><br/>Will and Elizabeth didn't get married, but there was a definite make out scene, but it was Jack and Elizabeth? Wha? She didn't have to make out with him in order to lock him on the boat. And Barbosa comes back? I see that he could have from the scene after the credits on the first one, but why put it at the end? Since I saw it just last night I'm still thinking over it, and I don't completely know what to think of it. If ""Pirates 2"" was not a sequel and it was just a movie by itself I would most likely have enjoyed it more so. But since it was the sequel to THE ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" it was a let down and didn't really have anything to do with the first one except for some of the characters. I have this theory of the ""Pirates"" trilogy. I think it will be like the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy. The first one is really good, the second one was okay, but nothing really amazing and then the third one blows us all away. At least this is what I am hoping."

Oh and when the compass pointed to Jack when she held it. Oh I'm all over the place, sorry. But at the end where Will doesn't even talk to her I was shocked when he agreed to go save Jack.

"Undeadozzy","10","1","5","7 July 2006"," Dead Man's Chest is Alive!!!!!!
","I have no choice but to say this was the best movie I have ever seen. Ever. It surpassed the original with better special effects, more sinister characters, more violence, more plot twists, and a somewhat darker story. Jerry Bruckheimer has never let his audiences down. Even before his work with Pirates of the Caribbean, remember his stellar direction of the movie The Rock? He has always given his movies his signature trademark of the movie generally kicking ass. I definitely suggest going to see this movie, even if you're not a Disney or pirate fan. This is the only PG-13 rated Disney movie ever to be released, as for good reason. The usual colorful Disney cliché is replaced with some realistic violence, more so in Dead Man's Chest than in the Curse of the Black Pearl. And yes, the plot twists are monumental. I'm not a spoiler, so I won't say anything, but let's just say I was rather surprised at the conclusion. The only thing I will spoil is, stay after the credits for a short yet somewhat comical scene. All in all, I'm going to make this short and to the point. SEE THIS MOVIE."

Johnney Deep show the people yet again that he can play very good roles. Bloom and Knightly we a cute couple but at the end Bloom was getting afraid because he saw knightly and deep kissing. now what was that about? but oh well about that. this movie made you jump out of your seat at time and laugh the next. it was great and Awesome. now can anybody say that they are not looking forward to the next film? now their are questions to ask is deep dead? i really don't think so. is Barbosa nice or not changed now that he is 'back from the dead'? i think he is partly both.<br/><br/>Well the movie was great just because it was was a Pirates of the Caribbean movie. but is was missing something. . . . the spark of the first movie. yes there was Jack, Elizabeth and Will BUT . . .it wasn't as focused as the first. it was hard to follow, and things can jump out but since the whole story won't be complete until the 3rd movie would show. i just hate cliff hanger endings. can you believe that happened. i thought he died??? but oh well. at the very beginning I was lost because some time has went by and the East Indian Trading company was like taking over. that was weird. but is was interesting how Elizabeth was dressed up like a guy and nobody noticed. she didn't even look like a guy. oh well. <br/><br/>Can't wait till the next movie!!"
"cmverana","7","1","5","7 July 2006"," Not surprised,
","I just saw the movie from the midnight showing.<br/><br/>The movie started out with beautiful scenery, really making you feel like you are out at sea. Jack's entrance was predictable yet still good, the story was going well (a bit random, too) and then in the middle of the movie, it sank.<br/><br/>I am a huge fan, I waited over 17 hours to get screening tickets for the first movie. But I tried not to get myself too excited about this one since sequels usually eat it. <br/><br/>Around an hour or hour and a half into the movie, nothing made sense. The monkey still had ""the curse"" yet the others didn't. Jack was acting like...well not really Jack. He lost ALL his morals and loyalty which in the end he usually comes around but didn't. The first minute I heard Will Turner talk, I thought ""You pay him millions of dollars to say lines like a soap opera star?"" (I am a fan of him and I love him but this wasn't his best movie) And Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) was acting like a lunatic slut. Everyone was out of character, mostly, except the bird on that guy's shoulder.<br/><br/>Then after about 3 million twists, you practically want to die. There were wonderful scenes in there but they were stretched out to the extent of making me want to fall asleep. It was about 20% lower in quality as for the all around movie itself compared to the original. I did like the idea of the Crack'n (not to much of those stupid squid people) but the movie really didn't follow the rules of the plot. I wish I saw more of a PIRATE movie then a Squid-meets-Final Fantasy X. BUT THE ENDING IS AWESOME. I really hope to dear god the next one is better or I feel like I wasted over 24 hours of waiting in line from the past 2 movies.<br/><br/>See it if you're bored and have 2 and a half hours to kill.

","What the world wanted was more Jack Sparrow, what we got was lots of Jack but no plot. From beginning to end I kept trying to find connections between from one scene to the next, how it was that all of these people got shoved into one movie, how everyone could find everyone in a matter of hours it seemed, and why Disney choose to wow the audience with CGI bad guys.<br/><br/>The First movie was amazing. Visually captivating and stunning, great plot and character development, wonderful lines, and of course Jack Sparrow. Movie two, brings everyone from the first movie (and I do mean everyone, supposed dead people as well. In fact people that were long dead in the first movie) I think it was gratuitous CGI, not enough plot and one hour too long. At the end of one there was a need to know what happened, but enough closure to make us feel like the last two hours of our lives weren't wasted, two does no such thing.<br/><br/>If you want great effects, funny parts, and a not so flamboyant Jack Sparrow, then this is the movie for you. But in all trilogies (less Star Wars) the second movie sucks so the third will blow you away, but nest time I won't be paying full price and it won't be at 12 pm."

","Three times better than Curse of the Black Pearl. Three times funnier. Three times more action. Three times more exciting. And three HUGE twists that you'll never see coming.<br/><br/>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is more fun than you could have hoped for. All of our favourite characters are back, along with plenty of new faces such as Davey Jones and Bootstrap Bill Turner. I cried, I almost literally wet myself laughing, I 'Aww'ed and I gasped, many times. This movie is great fun for people of all ages.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is his usual best, and then some, back in Captain Jack Sparrow's boots and swaggering his way from one disaster to another. You won't believe what he gets up to this time, and, as always, he will keep you utterly entertained.<br/><br/>Backing him up once again are Kiera Knightley, Orlando Bloom and Jack Davenport. Knightley has shed her 'girly ways' of the first film and will blow you away with her attitude and aggression with a sword. Bloom reprises his role as Will perfectly, bringing back the skilled and brave blacksmith we all love. And Davenport's character has changed considerably - almost the opposite of the Norrington we know - and it works brilliantly.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy is unrecognizable as the villainous Davy Jones, and he plays him perfectly. With scaly, cold skin, a claw and tentacles galore, you will be awe-struck when you see him in action.<br/><br/>All five principal roles, as well as the entire movie itself, are even better this time 'round. There is also an extra scene after the closing credits, and make sure you watch for a surprise return from another favourite character!<br/><br/>In addition, the CGI is absolutely amazing, as are the sets, concepts, scenery, costumes and stunts. There won't be a moment where you are not enthralled by the amazing adventure that is Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Although IMDb only allows 10, I rate Dead Man's Chest 100/10. This movie is a must-see for everyone. If you don't, you are seriously missing out on a masterpiece."

The story has so many twists and turns it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Lots of surprise visits from past characters!! The end is hardly an end at all, leaving most things WIDE open for the third installment. Stay past the end credits if you have time, but the ""extra"" scene isn't as good as the first movie's was. As before, the acting is phenomenal. The depth in Knighly's performance as well as Blooms is strengthened by the end which is really needed considering the circumstances. Depp's acting was wonderful but I was unable to see growth in character from the last movie; not a bad thing, but noticeable against the growth in the other lead actors. If you loved the first movie, you'll love the second. Definitely was worth going to the midnight showing for!!"

","I did not see CotBP when it came out. I thought ""not another pirate film"". But I was invited to see DMC so I thought I'd better watch the first one. I liked it, but not nearly as much as Dead Man's Chest. Normally, sequels are a let-down, but this was surprising and I liked the way it was darker than the first film. Davy Jones was extraordinary, especially Bill Nighy's performance and Johnny Depp was, of course, great as Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>The one thing that did vex me a bit was the whole Jack-Elizabeth sub-plot. It came a bit from nowhere without adequate explanation. The kiss at the end was not explained and I fear that I may have misinterpreted both their intentions. There was too much left unsaid, but that did not stop this from being an incredible, swashbuckling adventure AS PROMISED. Perhaps, the amateur psychologist in me needs to shut up and accept that this was a Disney film and aimed at families."
"redsoxmb545-1","7","1","6","27 July 2006"," Much Worse Than The 1st One
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the long anticipated sequel of the 2003 hit movie. The plot centers around Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp). He owes his soul to Davy Jones (Bill Nighty), who is the Captain of the ghostly Flying Dutchman ship. Sparrow must find a way to evade this eternal damnation with the help of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightly). This sequel is nowhere near par of the first one. It's running time is unnecessarily long at 2 and a half hours. It lacks the originality and humor of the first movie and just brings you on a ride that looks promising, but takes you absolutely nowhere. Sure, there's plenty of chaos and sword fights and running around, which is entertaining, but to an extent. However, there are some quite enjoyably scenes and in general as movie, it isn't bad at all. But with the expectations that came from the first one, it was just disappointing to me."

","Oh my God, where do I begin? This movie simply has it all.. I've always been a great fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean, and used to see it several times a day, while playing the game and listening to it's soundtrack, and I really looked forward to watching the follow-up, but I never thought that it would be so awesome! This movie has it all. Laughter, romance, tragedies, betrayal, evil, heroes, the-unforeseeable-turn-of event, you name it! Seriously, I'm not going to tell you too much about the movie it self, but damn, it has a way better story than the first one. Even though it was real good too. Also, this one explains a lot, which was left untold in the first one, for example; Jack's Compas, that ""doesn't work"" as they say, but this compass is so much better than any other.

","I don't understand the negative comments on this film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it immensely. Maybe it's just that I've been going to films for more than 45 years, and so I appreciated the salutes to other pirate films contained in this and _Curse of the Black Pearl_.<br/><br/>I was amused by the references to _20,000 Leagues Under the Sea_. In fact, I don't know when I've laughed as much at any film.<br/><br/>This one was a roller-coaster of a movie, and left me wanting more.

What's the point of leaving him and then end up saving him from the Crackin' then? sigh.....that was the sad part. I want to see Pirates Of The Caribbean Dead Man's Chest again.

","Well, what to say, except I love pirates. I fell in love with the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, and thought this one was going to be just as amazing. Unfortunately, sometimes it was hard to follow and understanding the plot was sometimes difficult. I asked myself ""Wait, what are they doing?"" throughout the movie. I do think it was very well done - keeping the main characters and adding new characters was one of the things I love about this sequel. However, the ending was not to my liking. How it ended with Jack ""supposedly"" getting eaten by the Kraken wasn't a good choice for his ""death"". And Barbosa getting in the picture without any explanation (he's supposed to be dead) made me somewhat annoyed. It makes me want to skip ahead a year for the next Pirate's movie to come out - waiting is not one of my good traits. I think the ending could have been put together a little better - the writers didn't need a lead off ending, because no matter what everyone will still want to see the next Pirate's movie."

"miles-underwood","6","1","6","7 July 2006"," Fun but poor ending
","This film is a fun film to watch. It tries to keep the successful elements of the first film but introduce a new plot with a few new characters.<br/><br/>Whilst I enjoyed sitting back to watch this, I felt cheated by the ending and the lack of conclusion. Some films, such as Kill Bill, have plots designed over two films and it works fine for Kill Bill. However, the plot for Pirates 2 is rather convoluted and consequently, the ""to be continued..."" tag seems to mean ""we want you to pay to see the next film"" or ""we've messed up this plot and will finish it later"". Quite simply, unless you go to see the third film, you will not discover what happens. I think this is a rather shameful money making technique."
"Mosquiton99","9","1","6","7 July 2006"," Great Movie
","I just got back from seeing it and it really delivered. The film has a lot of the themes and feelings that you got while watching the first Pirates of the Caribbean, action, adventure, humor the whole nine is here. Your in for a treat, I can see why the makers of Superman Returns wanted to get a head start at the box office over this.<br/><br/>The action is top notch, great sword fighting with creative use of the setting much like in the first one, the special effects had that big movie feel, yet they were subtle and natural. Seeing the portrayal of Davy Jones was especially good, and once again Johnny Depp delivered with an amazing performance. In addition to the action the humor was sprinkled throughout and gave the audience good laughs to keep us involved. All in all this is how a summer movie should be."
"RenegadeKnight","6","1","7","6 July 2006"," Great movie, but slightly unsatisfying
","Don't get me wrong: I loved Curse of the Black Pearl. But Dead Man's Chest is, in comparison, quite ugly.<br/><br/>The film itself is quite long, which is the first problem I had with it. When watching it, I found that there were scenes that either dragged on or were just unimportant that had been included in it, consequently making the film to be quite a chore to watch. I'm also speaking in terms of the actions sequences, in particular, one sequence, which lasted quite a few minutes longer than necessary.<br/><br/>Secondly, I didn't feel the characters as they were in the original. They seemed to lack the emotion, with the exception of Depp, who made a magnificent return. Bloom was quite bland in his acting, as was many of the other characters. Knightley was average, I suppose, but her performance was outdone by Depp's, but that's no surprise.<br/><br/>As far as the plot of the movie is concerned, I believe it was quite satisfying and entertaining, and rather simple to follow. The plot twist and cliffhanger ending makes up for it, in the end.<br/><br/>However, one thing that dragged from the film significantly was it's concern with being aesthetically pleasing, above all. Though the camera has captured some magic, it only highlights the rest of the film's faults.<br/><br/>But, I loved the movie. Definitely recommended for any fan of the first Pirates movie, but be warned: you may be disappointed."
"marimbadaddy","9","1","8","28 July 2006"," Pirates 2.1, got to wait a year for 2.2 to complete the plot
","Wow. A lot of fun. Almost as much fun as the Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>I didn't like this as much as the first POTC film. Mainly because I couldn't get over Davy Jones' & his crew's severe dermatological problems. I guess it was hard for the effects team to top the undead moonlit creative genius from the first film.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the fact that this film doesn't end. You will have to actually see the 3rd film to get to the denouement of the plot. Similar to the ending moments of Back to the Future 2, but not nearly as satisfying. As a matter of fact the ending of this film raises more questions than it answered. Though I may skip the the third film out of spite. So the title should be 2.1 and the third film should actually be called Pirates of the Caribbean 2.2: The Curse of Disney Co's Greed."

","What's not to like here? Depp is back and does his Keith Richards/Pirate combo schtick very nicely, Orlando Bloom and Keira K are fine in their roles, the Kraken is a WOW of an effect, Davy Jones is even better than Gollum, and you have to like his sharky/snaily/seaweed etc henchmen too. Great stuff.<br/><br/>What doesn't work so well? Okay, the last hour or so is slowish and the movie is about half an hour too long if that. It's also Clearly a set-up for the third one.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* I thought the appearance of Geoffrey Rush from the first was great, at the end, and I also thought the Kraken closeup, if you will, at the end, was terrific. All teeth and tentacles. You could only imagine things like that back in the day, Harryhausen included.<br/><br/>Check this one out if you liked the first one, the fencing, stunts, cannibal island segment and the like all work rather well.

He must seek the Captain Jack Sparrow whose compass points the way to a notorious dead man's chest. Not long after, they find themselves running from a bunch of undead pirates and a mythical creature known as the Kraken.<br/><br/>We follow the adventures of the protagonists of the first installment as they must face once again a couple of supernatural creatures in order to achieve their goal. Once again, old tales will come to life and our heroes will have to do what it takes to make things right, at least for them.<br/><br/>To start with the beginning, we have the same main characters as in the previous movie, but less developed and apparently, less involved in the outcome. Thus, you don't get to care so much about their fate, making the actions somewhat pointless. To make matters worse, the part which made the whole adventure a real treat, which is the comedy, somehow faded into the fog. It wasn't as present, as funny or as intelligent as it was before. They somehow expected it to be funny out of the box, through stupidity, irony or basic gags.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the visual part is very good, doing its job well in animating the story. Speaking of which, following the trend of the other features, it lacks substance, depth or some sort of spark that might make it a bit less linear than it is. If its predecessor required a bit of polish in terms of storytelling, this one definitely required plenty more attention which it didn't quite receive.<br/><br/>Overall, what you get is a big downgrade in terms of amusement, thrill or suspense. It's kind of predictable and it seems to not put much effort in maintaining the quality of its predecessor. It's a shame from my point of view, as I really enjoyed the first one so I had high hopes regarding this one. Too bad..."

"cody-phillipsphotography","8","0","1","12 May 2017"," Worthy sequel, iffy plot
","Curse of the Black Pearl opened in white, shrouded in deep fog. Focused on whites and Earth tones, the opening was ominous and brooding. That is not the case for Dead Man's Chest, where it opens in blues and greens. Sadness and horror both are the main focus of emotion for the opening sequence. Opening with a dreadful wedding day, that sense of dread is heightened past the first couple of minutes when the real horror begins. Dark, dreary, and truly horrifying, the prison scene really sets the mood for what is to come. Dead Man's Chest is dark in a literal sense, but not so much in the story. There are many points throughout the film where it does explore some dark themes, especially with the introduction of Davy Jones' character. This character seems to be the main focal point of the darkness, which he brings throughout the entire film. The rest of the film is much lighter than the first, still maintaining to throw in some jokes, even during the darker parts of the film. The CGI is remarkable, especially with the film's release date. 2006 was when CGI really was starting to get good, and this film shows just how good it was able to be. Seeing the images before the computer images were introduced are remarkable, with the artists doing a beautiful job creating the characters that are part of Davy Jones's crew. Even the kraken does look realistic, especially with the first introduction. It's remarkable to see where CGI has went, and this really is one of the first films that I can recall that shows just how good Disney's animation was at the time. The biggest problem with Dead Man's Chest wasn't anything with the plot, but rather, the focus of the film. The focus of the film was very broad, as it introduced many characters. Out of all of these new characters, there is one the stood out the most, which would be Davy Jones. Throughout the film, any scene with this character was amazing, which is due to Bill Nighy's electric performance. This one character outshone every character, especially the returning characters. The focus should have bee more aimed toward the characters that were the main characters, not the new villain. Dead Man's Chest may not be as good as Curse of the Black Pearl, but it is still an amazing adventure film. This is the weakest film out of the original trilogy, mainly due to the introduction of so many characters, where the focus seemed to shift from Jack Sparrow and crew to Davy Jones and crew. Nonetheless, this film still is a fun pirate adventure that was a landmark for CGI."

","This movie continues the story told in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Prevented from marrying Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) and accused of piracy, Will (Orlando Bloom) leaves Port Royal with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) in order to seek the heart of Davy Jones, the fearsome commander of the ""Flying Dutchman"". But Sparrow hides that he has more selfish reasons for that search: try to catch the man whom he promised his own soul. Directed by Gore Verbinsky has screenplay by Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, and other Collaborators.<br/><br/>As often happens with big blockbusters, this is the predictable and awaited sequel to ""Pirates of the Caribbean"". The cast brings some new faces: Bill Nighy will play Davy Jones, Stellan Skarsgård will play Bill Turner, Tom Hollander will play the villain, Cutler Beckett, and Naomie Harris will give life to Tia Dalma. But the most interesting is the evolution of the central characters, inherited from the previous film. Will reveals himself increasingly a true pirate, as his bride that, in this film, will take part in the action scenes, leaving skirts behind. Jack, on the other hand, is increasingly ambiguous and unpredictable: sometimes a hero, sometimes a villain, liar and deceiver, we never know what he is doing or thinking. The plot is fun and very interesting: each character has its own interests and reasons to find that heart, reasons that may be conflicting. The rivalry comes to the point that it's every man for himself and every fighting and deceiving each other. In technical matters, characterization and computerization deserves a word of congratulations. If they make a great job in the previous movie with the undead, now they surpassed it with the powerful and intimidating visual effect of the ""Flying Dutchman"" and its eternal crew.<br/><br/>This film is, in my opinion, one of the best sequels I've seen so far, not only managing to maintain the continuity of the story, as becoming it more interesting, thanks to the evolution of characters, making clear the imminence of a third film also."
"kdavies-69347","7","0","1","2 March 2016"," A Comparative Look at the Pirates Series - Part 2: Dead Man's Chest
","The second entry in the series returns to the world of pirates in a bold new way.<br/><br/>It is still an Adventure film in many ways, but I think this and the next in the series is far more in the realm of Fantasy. Dead Man's Chest brings back the characters that we were introduced to in the first film, and many new ones to add more depth to the 'Pirates' world.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film we return to the island where William Turner, and Elizabeth Swann have recently started their life together. Very early on, their relationship is threatened by a new and much more human villain. Under the employ of the East India Trading Company, a man by the name of Cutler Beckett uses his financial and political clout to arrest both William and Elizabeth for their acts of piracy in the first film. He uses this to manipulate William to hunt down Jack Sparrow and bring him to justice. Jack hasn't changed much since the first film. When we are introduced to him, he is literally escaping what looks like hell, and he does so with such ease that he makes it look like fun. In addition we are introduced to another new villain, Davy Jones (fantastically played by Bill Nighy) who is consumed by an immortal quest to sail the seas and collect the souls of the dead to spend 100 years aboard his ship in service. Personally, I think he is my favourite personality throughout the series, if not just for the facial expressions he (and the FX team) managed to portray through the digital design of the character.<br/><br/>This movie and its sequel serve a much larger portion of plot to the viewer. Dead Man's Chest serves as the middle story for the original trilogy of films. There is a definite negative undertone throughout as each character goes through their own trials and alliances are tested. It becomes quite obvious that each person will play their part and betrayal is the main theme of this movie. Despite the fondness William may have for Jack, they are pitted against each other. Elizabeth finds herself in a position of power for the first time and must use it to manipulate Jack to her own ends. And of course the villains of the film pulling the strings to achieve their own ends.<br/><br/>This entry is probably the darkest in tone, and certainly has an undertone of death to it. The fight scenes are certainly aggressively violent for a Disney movie, but I think it was essential for this adventure. It is the 'Empire Strikes Back' of the series, and so; ends with a cliff-hanger as expected. It maintains that level of excitement throughout and plays an important role in the series, although perhaps not as lighthearted and fun as the original.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann's wedding is interrupted by Lord Cutler Beckett of the East India Trading Company who arrests them for aiding Captain Jack Sparrow. Norrington is also wanted but he has resigned and disappeared. Beckett offers Will pardons if he retrieves Sparrow's compass. Meanwhile Sparrow is haunted by impending doom from Davy Jones and his compass seems to be malfunctioning.<br/><br/>This is utter madness. Anybody who claims clarity about the plot upon watching it the first time is simply lying. The story is a convoluted collision of non-sense. The jumping from one set of characters to the next leaves the movie disjointed. What's left is Johnny Depp doing a repeat performance. He continues to be one of the craziest character ever. It's not original anymore but he's still great like when he escapes from the natives. Davy Jones and his crew are things of marval. There is definitely greatness here but it's a jumble mess."

","The second movie took most of the favourite characters we all know and thrusted them into a new adventure, that lasted two films, whilst continuing the Will and Elizabeth plot. It didn't live up to the first film, mainly because the first was so unexpectedly good. However, this is still a fun and great film. There is a distinctive gap, for me at least, between the first three and the last movie. It suffered, too, by not following a basic film structure, which kind of has end randomly and without a full feeling. There are plenty of laughs, however, along with great action, satisfactory acting and some cool new characters, the pick of the bunch being Davy squid face Jones. The back-story of the Pearl is interesting and scenes that you'd expect to be boring justaren't, as is the case with most of the parts from the Gore Verbinski's trilogy. Overall the movie manages to stay very clear of the red zone by being light on its feet and filling in its content. A worthy entry and a fitting middle section acting as a bridge to The Curse of the Black Pearl and to At World's End."

","The second installment in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, built upon premises set in the first film, is not a a continuation of the old story, but it sets out to tell a new one. Oftentimes, in the lore of adventure fantasy films, such a trait is met with disappointment. But not so with this one; Dead Man's Chest is a captivating, alluring and, coming out of the slightly fairly-tale air of its predecessor, pleasantly dark. The darkness issues from failed love, a man's inner torments which he wants to inflict upon others, and the visual gloom of the great ghost ship. Captain Jack Sparrow is as full of his paradoxical wits as ever. He is in his primes. We come to meet some of the aspects of his ""truer"" self which were too elaborate for the first film. Overall a tour de force of computer graphics and its manipulation to tell a human tale. Director Gore Verbinsky is masterful in telling his magical dark story. And without saying something about the soundtrack, all of this would be vain: the wrathful organ playing of Davy Jones is, in my opinion at least, one of the greatest pieces ever composed."

","The follow-up chapter to Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl might appear inferior in content & a step-down in quality of narration but it nonetheless succeeds as a worthy sequel that presents significant upgrades in many aspects, takes the spectacle of the first film to a higher level and despite a few hiccups remains a highly entertaining & amusing ride for the most part.<br/><br/>The second instalment in the Pirates of the Caribbean series, Dead Man's Chest continues the journey of the savvy pirate Captain Jack Sparrow as he's reminded of the debt he owes to Davy Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, and then races against time to steal Jones' heart in order to strike a bargain with him. But he isn't the only one as other friends & foes seek the heart for their own agendas as well.<br/><br/>Directed by Gore Verbinski, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest opens on a really interesting note, takes more time than before to set up its premise because of which a few sequences feel static but once the board is set, the movie truly delivers the epic spectacle it promised. The screenplay follows multiple story lines often interacting with each other at times but it does come together in the end to form a coherent structure.<br/><br/>The technical aspects present a massive upgrade, thanks to the higher budget. Set pieces are even more impressive than before and both the Black Pearl & the Flying Dutchman are magnificently designed & detailed. Cinematography exhibits a dynamic range in capturing all the action & drama, the exotic locations are beautifully photographed and it also makes extensive use of the colour palette to provide its tale a more vivid touch.<br/><br/>Editing fails to give the narrative a tightly-knitted structure like it did in the earlier chapter for there are a few sequences that could've been further trimmed, even the pace is uneven at places and its 150 minutes of runtime is felt on few occasions. Visual effects is a major step-up that ups the ante by a significant margin and what it did with CGI back then was an achievement in itself, plus it works in tandem with make-up team to make its effects work.<br/><br/>Finally, the music department exhibits a major forward leap as well. While the previous film was scored by one of Hans Zimmer's prodigies, it's the master himself who takes the front seat for this sequel and delivers a soundtrack that certainly goes down as one of his finest compositions. Orchestrated with bigger instruments, Zimmer's score pulsates with an epic feel that encapsulates the whole picture and goes a long way in enhancing the experience.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom & Keira Knightley reprise their respective roles of Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner & Elizabeth Swann and further build upon their inputs of the first film. Depp once again overshadows everyone with yet another swashbuckling turn as the savvy pirate but his performance isn't as terrific as it was in the previous movie. Also making an instant impression of his own is Bill Nighy in the role of Davy Jones, and what an intriguing character he is!<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest might be slightly inferior to The Curse of the Black Pearl but it's just as enjoyable, entertaining & amusing, if not more. The plot tends to be more inclined towards the fantasy element but it takes the humour with it and the sense of adventure is kept alive throughout its runtime. It's just that few scenes exist only for viewers' amusement & contribute nothing vital to the story. Definitely more epic in both scope & ambition, Dead Man's Chest is a worthy sequel that gets most things right, if not all. Delightfully recommended."

"CinematicInceptions","8","0","1","22 February 2015"," Very well executed with a great plot. Vulnerable to criticism, but still very good.
","This movie flows together better than probably any other movie that I've seen. Granted, it has a fairly complicated plot to go through, but if you don't understand it and enjoyed the movie, that's just an excuse to watch it again. I enjoyed it quite as much re-watching it as seeing it the first time, though I hadn't seen all of the first movie before seeing Dead Man's Chest. It is best to have seen the first movie beforehand. There aren't any major plot points that they share, but you won't have nearly as good a handle on the characters if you see this movie separately.<br/><br/>The first way that this film flows together is in the technical area. The visual and audio effects coupled with the cinematography and music score create an incredible atmosphere in the action scenes, particularly those featuring the Kraken. An argument could be made that there was too much computer graphic used, but you can't deny that it came out well.<br/><br/>The second way that it flows together is the plot line. Again, there are drawbacks to it since it's easy to get lost in all of the threads of the plot, and that doesn't change in the third film. However, it creates a great story and builds the characters in a great way, particularly the new faces of Becket, Davy Jones, Mercer, and Bootstrap Bill. The scene at Isla Cruces is a great microcosm of the movie and brings the entire story together with all of the characters in one place. The one plot point that wasn't explained well enough was that Jack isn't safe on land because of the East India Company. It is possible to piece that together, but I doubt that most people were able to figure that out during the movie with the information provided.<br/><br/>The explosive action is a prominent aspect of the movie. There are some sea battles, scattered sword duels, a couple of chase scenes, and some supernatural fantastical battles with the Kraken and the Dutchmen crew. The progression of the Kraken's appearances are great, and by the time it attacks the Pearl at the end, we understand how dangerous and frightening it is.<br/><br/>Possibly the most prominent element featured is the characters. Jack Sparrow is still quirky, selfish, but capable of doing good. The comic relief that he generates is, in my opinion, much better than what Marvel movies have been trying to do lately. Will Turner is still working mostly for his fiancé Elizabeth, but gets a lot of depth added to his character by meeting his father, Bootstrap Bill. Elizabeth returns as more than the average damsel in distress, and becomes involved with the plot threads involving Becket, Jack, and Norrington. Norrington is now disgraced, but is still sort of a villain, though not the main one. He ultimately comes out on top in this installment. Our two main bad guys our new faces Davy Jones and Cutler Becket. Davy Jones has relatively little depth in this movie, though it gets built upon in At World's End, and is a very intimidating villain that threatens what little safety the sea provides. Becket joins the ranks of hateable characters as he turns nearly every main character upon each other through his desire for the chest. The other minor characters are Marty, Cotton, Pintel, Ragetti, Tia Dalma, Gibbs, and Mercer. The last two are rather intriguing characters. Gibbs is kind of in his own separate category of characters, as he plays a minor role, but is perhaps the person who understands Jack the best. Mercer is the hands and feet of Becket, but obviously enjoys his job and is very good at sneaking around and gathering information. All of the parts have B+ to A grade acting, except for Stellen Skasgard, though others may disagree with that as they please. Though Jack Sparrow is advertised as the main character, he is really one of many and sometimes has fifteen minutes of screen time where his character is untouched.<br/><br/>If you liked Curse of the Black Pearl, this second movie should not disappoint. Be open to watching it multiple times before and/or after seeing At World's End. It reaches lots of genres, but is primarily an action adventure film. If possible watch it in high definition for the great effects. Overall Rating: 9.45/10"

","PotC: Dead Man's Chest just as good as the first film (simply said). The story takes us deeper into the world of Jack, Elizabeth and William and sails the audience out into the stormy seas where we meet the character Davy Jones and his cursed crewmen. Squid-faced Davy Jones' look is enough to give anyone the heebie jeebies but his sinister ways are even scarier which gives the movie's story it's core.<br/><br/>This is another great family film but if you or someone you know is a bit squeamish then you may want to pass on this film. The movie is not all that bloody nor gory but does have a gross-out factor with Davy Jones and his crew.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"alindsay-al","6","0","1","2 July 2014"," A solid film but disappointing after the original pirates
","The first pirates film is just so good that it was always going to be a worry if this film could live up to the original and unfortunately it doesn't, but it is still a fun film to watch. This film starts with Elizabeth Swann and Will Turner facing death for their association with Jack Sparrow in the first film. The only way to save them is for will and Elizabeth to reunite with Sparrow to find the dead mans chest. Now in the lead Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow is fantastic like he is in the majority of this franchise and he continues this in this film. I also thought even not as good as Barbosa, Davey Jones was a pretty good villain and looked the way I would imagine Davey Jones to look and act. But for other supporting characters like Elizabeth, Will and Bootstrap Bill I thought they were just annoying and winey in this film compared to the good overall performances in the first film. The story is also mixed bag similar to the original as for the opening exchanges it seems to be really jarring and all over the place especially with the scenes with the pelogostos. But as the story progresses it gets more interesting as I did like the different people and their different reasons for wanting the chest. The script just like the characters is good when it comes to Jack Sparrow but everybody else seems a bit wooden with their delivery and lack of emotion a lot of the time. Obviously with the crew of The Flying Dutchman and The Kraken the visuals are phenomenal in this film and is a great feature in all the pirates films. Now even though it wasn't as good as I wanted it was still okay and there will be more hopefully better pirates films."
"ajhsterk","8","0","1","10 June 2014"," A great film. By Sonja Dijkxhoorn, Jaro Kloosterman and Alexander Sterk
","The film ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", directed by Gore Verbinski, is the second installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. It includes amazing screenplay, spectacular special effects, all done by one of the most entertaining cast and crew in movie history. The humour is not like most of the cheesy comedy films nowadays, but more natural, mainly thanks to Johnny Depp, who performs as 'the pirate who is never sober': ""Captain Jack Sparrow"". Some references to the first film are made from time to time, so you will have to watch those films first. The plot is great, but not the main reason why it is fantastic: the scenes are exciting and the dialogue is very interesting, especially the subtle jokes. In other words, it is a film that is worth watching, from the first minute until the last one.<br/><br/>In this film, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is seeking the ""Dead Man's Chest"" in which Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) allegedly placed his heart inside when he got stood up by the sea goddess Calypso. In order to find the chest, Jack will need help from Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). Jack needs the chest but also the key to unlock the chest as leverage against Davy Jones: he and Jones made a deal 13 years ago: Jack would get the Black Pearl in exchange for his soul. Therefore, Jack, reluctant to pay his debt, needs the chest. In the meantime, Turner is secretly working for the East India Trading Company in order to get a royal pardon for his fiancée Elizabeth and himself. He has to steal Jack's magic compass that has been given to him by Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris). Only problem being that Jack needs the compass to find the chest. During their adventure, they get captured by a hill tribe, attacked by a Kraken, and reconnect with their old ""pal"" from the first film: Ex-Commodore Norrington. It has an open ending, so it is recommended to watch the other films as well.<br/><br/>With Gore Verbinski directing, the film had not only an amazing acting cast but also contained spectacular stunts. The stunning special effects were created thanks to an stunt coordinator (George Marshall Ruge) and a skillful team of digital artists for the animations and the blue screen effects.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best example of the spectacular stunts done in the film is in one of the final scenes containing a sword-fight between Captain Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and James Norrington. During this battle, the three of them 'magically' appear to get stuck on a rolling wheel -still fighting-, resulting in an epic battle over the key to the Dead Man's Chest. Swordfighting is the most common stunt done in this film, being a pirate adventure in the 17th century. But the whole film would be a bit dull if it would fully consist of sword-fighting: there is a vast variety of stunts, diverging from simple jumping and climbing to complex falls. Nonetheless, everything appears as natural as any film, if not better.<br/><br/>The digital artists did a lot of very well performed special effects such as the crew of the Flying Dutchmen. They have been done with CGI and Motion Capture Suits. These suits are full of white dots on the moving body parts (such as joints) and later, in the animation room, the dots are used to get a good direction of how the body moves for the animated character. The CGI itself looked great but not exactly 'real'. But that did not matter considering the fact that almost everything in the film is actually fake. You get used to it and the film looks great: real or not real. The digital artists definitely did whatever they could do, to make the Special Effects in this film one of the best we have ever seen.<br/><br/>One thing in this film that is not fake, most of the time, is the background. The filming is mainly done on actual tropical islands and ships that were built, which however did not sail. Only a few scenes, were filmed with the use of a blue-screen. There is almost no difference to be seen between a real background and a blue-screen background, thus the animators have done a terrific job.<br/><br/>The best scenes containing animation in this film are, without a doubt, the ones with the Kraken! The CGI is so complex and looks stunning. If you decide to watch this film make sure to pay all your attention to these scenes because they are a milestone for Special Effects. The Kraken has been animated with CGI in its entirely and the actors had no reference to the Kraken at all, whilst acting 'with it'. This makes it especially difficult for the animators to get the height, width and position of the Kraken correct.<br/><br/>This film is a definite must-see blockbuster. Although the plot may be a little dull and far-fetched, the action and the quick-moving plot line makes it even again. The funny anecdotes and the dry humor, especially Jack Sparrow, makes this a film for all audiences. The director made an excellent choice concerning the actors, since they really fit the characters. Furthermore the special effects in this film are of a whole new level and made a big impact on the making of many films that came after this one. If you want to see this film, you must watch the prequel since all the movies form a big plot line together. But after you have watched it, you must see the sequels since this film has an open end and it is such great fun to see this film. All together, the acting, Special Effects and the stunts is what makes Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest an interesting film and that is why we have decided on giving it a 4-star rating."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","0","2","7 June 2014"," Just as good as the original, suffers from minor continuity issues
","It was hard not to enjoy Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003). Pirates are always a fun subject to tell stories about. Johnny Depp exceeded at portraying a new character on screen while working with a script that not only created an interesting world that he lives in, but a lively one at that. After such a critical and financial success, even with some of its dark moments, it would seem important that the mouse house would stick with keeping this particular franchise afloat (pardon the pun) with the same elements while adding something new to the story. Thankfully, that's what they did. Besides a number of small issues, this sequel holds up extremely well.<br/><br/>After defeating Captain Barbossa and reclaiming the Black Pearl as his own, Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) returns to the seas. Unknown to him, he is quickly needed again by Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) to help him find the key to a secret chest only known by Davy Jones, the Captain of the Flying Dutchman. If Turner doesn't find this soon, he and his fiancé Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) are to be hung for treason and letting a criminal escape (that being Jack Sparrow). Just by starting the cast off with these three, is great see. Their chemistry worked in the first and they continue to work well here too and that's not all. Several cast members from the first film come back too which is a pleasure. I was surprised to even see Jack Davenport (Commodore James Norrington) return. Even stranger is that although it feels like with all the returning cast, the experience would feel too much of the same, but it's not.<br/><br/>There are three new main characters to the roster. Naomie Harris plays Tia Dalma, a spiritual witch who has a way with words and expands the backstory of Davy Jones. Stellan Skarsgård adds an interesting mix to the story when it turns out he's Bootstrap Bill, the father of Will Turner. Lastly, there's Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) who's not terrifying if you're older than 13 but he's still a force to be reckoned with. Besides it is cool how well the body of an octopus was integrated in with his face. There's another internal struggle that goes on with Jack Sparrow involving whether he really is more than just a pirate. It's good character development. Again, just like the first film, Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio's writing is great at adding new material to what fans and audiences have already accepted from the start.<br/><br/>However, there is one issue with this movie and its the only problem too. There are numerous events involving continuity that go without explanation. An example of this is when Jack Sparrow captures Barbossa's undead monkey. I later discovered that the monkey was undead because in the post credits of the first movie, the monkey had stolen a piece of the cursed treasure. Now how would someone know that if they didn't watch the post credits? Another event like this belonged to when audiences finally see Pintel and Ragetti in a boat with a the dog who holds the jail keys. Since when did the dog become their ownership? I do not recall them taking the dog or the dog following them. Some explanation would be appreciated on scenes like these because its confusing to how various characters got into such situations. Like it was stated before though, this is the only issue.<br/><br/>Once more, Dariusz Wolski's cinematography is beautiful, capturing all wide panoramic shots of the sea and various islands. The action is still very entertaining. It does not involve as many canon explosions as did the first, but in replace of this, viewers get to see the Kraken. By golly is this cephalopod enormous. It's suction cups are gigundo, with agile tentacles that batter any ship to pieces. Oh, and don't forget that dental job, woo! The special effects, which also make up the Kraken and several other of Davy Jones' sailors look great too. There's such a diverse imagination with what they look like with several mixes of marine wildlife. I can't imagine having barnacles or scallops growing off my face though. Finally, although he co-wrote the score to the first with Klaus Badelt, Hans Zimmer takes the reigns as full composer. Fans of his music should be able to tell he took over because their are parts to the score that have more emphasis on heavy tones involving strings. Zimmer also keeps the same main theme for Sparrow and even includes a softer theme for the tragic character of Davy Jones. It is still a great follow up altogether.<br/><br/>It suffers from silly continuity errors but that's its only flaw. The action, music, special effects and characters all still entertain at the level they did from the first. Watch out for that Kraken though, man what a giant."
"phubbs","6","0","1","7 December 2013"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","'Fifteen men on the Dead Man's Chest Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum! Drink and the devil had done for the rest Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!'<br/><br/>Who'd of thought a movie based on a theme park and pirates would be so successful that it would garner a sequel. A sequel that was so so so utterly huge in production values it makes perfect sense that it would fail to live up to its predecessor. The old lesson Hollywood never learns, making things bigger and flashier doesn't always mean it will be better.<br/><br/>The plot? oh geez where to begin. This is the main issue with this franchise which begun in this sequel, only to get worse in the third film. The story becomes so convoluted and twisty its hard to keep up, and this is a Disney film!. Put very simply...most of the characters are all after various bit n pieces including 'Davy Jones' heart, 'Sparrow's' compass and the Black Pearl. Each character has their own reason for needing each item and most of these reasons intertwine with each other at some point, oh and old characters come back into the fray.<br/><br/>The plot is the first film was pretty straight forward, I'm not saying simple is best but it was easy to swallow. This film kicks off relatively well with the characters we know in trouble for helping Sparrow, a deal is set, a plan underway and everybody knows who is doing what and why. The trouble is as the film progresses sub plots pop up, new characters enter with their own story arcs, old characters come back with more story arcs, plans change and double crossing ensues. I can't deny it becomes tricky but in the end it is decipherable and when you think about it its quite good.<br/><br/>So once you've got your head around the plot you do tend to notice how BIG everything has become. The prison Sparrow escapes from at the start looks very similar to some kind of fortress you'd expect to see in a Tolkien story. The entire early cannibal infested island part of the film really does show how the franchise took a swing for the worst. Sparrow, Norrington and Turner break out into a three way fight over Jones chest which lasts for at least 10-15 minutes, displays way way too much slapstick, completely unbelievable cartoon stunts that detach you from the film and the trio end up covering half the island whilst battling!. In short the whole sequence wasn't needed, it was completely overblown and merely flashy filler, it bared no importance to the plot whatsoever...and this is what you will come to expect from the franchise thereafter.<br/><br/>Now of course we know this franchise is a comedy of sorts, a period set comedy action thriller for everyone to enjoy. The first film had a nice balance of that plus some supernatural fantasy that really worked well. This sequel added that horrendous cartoonish hijinx that totally tore you away from any suspension of disbelief because it went beyond that into a pure hokey farce.<br/><br/>On top of the ludicrous tomfoolery now on show this film has easily had much more creative influence from the classic video game The Secret of Monkey Island. If you know the game its quite plain to see really, the cannibal island at the start, the murky, misty, swampy location where the team meet voodoo priestess 'Tia Dalma' and of course that character in her entirety, plus the similarity Jones has to 'LeChuck' in terms of evil behaviour, the supernatural and looks.<br/><br/>It is a shame because the film is a good fantasy with some gorgeous visuals both CGI and real time. Davy Jones and his crew are incredible, a real sight to behold, especially Jones squid-like face of course. Its amazing to actually see CGI that looks so good you think its a real makeup job. The other crew members are also so vividly imaginative and well crafted, every scene with these fishy dogs was really great fun, I was always looking out for different types of mutants in the background. I really liked their vessel the Dutchman and the war torn barnacle covered ghost ship appearance it was given (much like the Pearl and its ghostly shrouds of mist n fog), and of course the Kraken was a fun nautical myth to include if somewhat unoriginal and not too good on the CGI front.<br/><br/>Its still a fun film which is saved by the British actors and their astoundingly fun well spoken pomposity, that and the excellent effects on Jones and his (undead?) crew. The finale for Sparrow is an exciting cliffhanger even though you know he will be back, its interesting to see a group of heroes bickering and double crossing each other instead of simply fighting together as one unbeatable team and that supernatural spice is just right. The plot difficulties do mire proceedings but Verbinski just about pulls it off and manages to provide decent escapism.<br/><br/>6/10"
"lesleyharris30","7","0","2","22 November 2013"," Disappointing, but Nonetheless Enjoyable,
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and an impressive cast. It is quite gripping at times, as we see Captain Jack Sparrow in even more peril, Johnny Depp is still in great form the second time around, his grace and charm in the role is always the highlight for me. <br/><br/>Will and Elizabeth's relationship is poorly developed here, which was the biggest let down for me. It was established very well in Curse of the Black Pearl, but we really do not get anything new about their life together here, it is the very same as the predecessor. As well as that, the plot is simply not as good, we are given so much in this movie, but it is lacking the magic of the first, despite all that is presented, I still finished it not feeling stimulated. It may be a let down, but Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is still fun ride, worth the watch if you are a fan of the original, or if you are looking for a good action or adventure. <br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow heads on a journey with his crew to find Davy Jones' heart in order to avoid becoming his slave. He soon discovers he has many rivals looking for the very same thing.<br/><br/>Best Performance: Johnny Depp"
"jimbo-53-186511","7","0","1","19 October 2013"," Almost as good as the first film
","Like the first film, this second film in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise was both funny and entertaining.<br/><br/>In this second film, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (Bloom and Knightley) have been sentenced to death for their part in assisting with the escape of a felon - namely Jack Sparrow. As a sort of 'plea bargain' Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander)informs Will that he will give Elizabeth and Will a pardon if he is able to recover Jack Sparrow's compass. When Will tells Jack that he wants his compass to give to Lord Beckett in order to get a pardon for him and Elizabeth, Jack agrees but only if Will gets him the key for Davy Jones's locker. Jack wants to get to this locker as he believes that it will bestow untold benefits for the person who unlocks this locker. However, Jack isn't the only one who is interested in what's in Davy Jones's locker. There are several parties who are desperate to get their hands on the key for the locker and each person/party has their own reasons for desperately wanting to 'unlock' the locker - but who will get there first? There is no doubt that this is a more than satisfactory entry into the franchise. All the elements from the first film are very much present -there is humour, great effects, the story was good once again and the cinematography was also fantastic. Johnny Depp once again stole the show as Captain Jack Sparrow - he had me in stitches at times (sometimes without evening saying anything). His mannerisms alone made me laugh.<br/><br/>There are a couple of minor negatives to this entry in the POTC franchises; Firstly, there were a couple of times when the film seemed to drag and there was the odd occasion when it got a tad boring (something that definitely couldn't be said about the first film). Secondly, Davy Jones just wasn't a particularly good villain (Captain Barbossa was fantastic in the first film and seemed to have a bit of character). I just didn't feel the same way about Davy Jones, for me he was a pretty forgettable villain). There were a couple of scenes that were completely ridiculous (sword fighting on a rolling wheel & Sparrow pole vaulting head first between two cliffs) but to be honest those scenes were so funny that I really didn't care about how silly they were as I was too busy laughing to care.<br/><br/>Overall then this film is still entertaining and the acting was good by all involved - but the lack of a good villain and a couple of boring moments in the middle of the film let it down slightly. If you're a fan of the first film, then you'll enjoy this film."

It is not another crappy sequel after all.<br/><br/>Granted, it is not exactly a masterpiece or anything, but it is fun and entertaining (and has the same vibe of Curse of the Black Pearl, which is a good thing in my book). It has an interesting plot... and it still has Jack Sparrow, along with Johnny Depp's superb acting! Also, I have to give kudos to the special effects department! The look of Davy Jones, his crew and the Flying Dutchmen is simply haunting, and very creative. These ""sea monsters"" (so to speak) contrast very well with the ""pirate ghosts"" of Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>My only two criticism are the random situation with Jack/ Will Turner and the cannibals, and the slight overuse of Pintel and Ragetti.<br/><br/>I've yet to see the third, but considering I just regained my interest in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, I might as well enjoy it.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film but enjoyed the first, I highly recommend it."

","...like any other sequels as well a bit flawed. I'm probably one of the fewest viewers who didn't ship an attraction between Elizabeth and Jack, but now please guys don't get me wrong, this movie is still brilliant. Johnny does a fantastic job as captain Jack once again. Orlando Bloom's Will Turner has a small character growth and shows more of his willingness's to do whatever is necessary to ensure Elizabeth's safety, including once again, risking his life. I felt really bad for Norrington in this one. I founded his twisted fate a great turn up, but I was still unable to not feel sorry for him. Still, Jack Davenport gave us an amazing performance. Keira Knightley did a wonderful job also, her character changed and become more mature and brave and let aside her ""damsel-in-distress"" image for good. One thing that I didn't like about her, were her clothes. Those didn't suite her at all, especially that hat, but this is not a reason to hate the movie, so let's continue. The CGI were excellent worked in this movie. Davy Jones appearance is a really jaw dropping scene, because he is such an unpredictable character and you can't really make a single opinion about him. A bit cruel and sadistic, but a very complicated and twisted character, Bill Nighy did a fantastic job over all. Also the appearance of Cutler Beckett and his scenes after would make you want to slap Tom Hollander, and by saying this I'm praising Tom's performance. Surely I find him more evil than Davy Jones. Now I want to congratulate Gore Verbinski for the stunning visual effects and the epic battle scenes, especially those involving the Kraken. By the way, the Kraken is one awesome made monster and I really hold my breath at the final battle scene when everything seemed to be doomed, but at least, not every loved character paid the harsh price of death. And the one who paid clearly has a chance of coming back in the next sequel. The soundtrack was awesome. Hans Zimmer is as always a truly artist and no doubt my favorite composer.<br/><br/>And the ending is indeed shocking but brilliant. The most awesome shocking endings you can experience. And if it comes from a favorite character it is likely to get suck on your head for good. Brilliant acting, stunning visual effects, awesome battle scenes, several breathtaking and anxious action sequences, and a dramatic ending as well. It's a worth watching movie, and not a ( I really despise this line) two and a half hours movie that you will never get back as some (in my opinion)immature audiences and critics say. You can easily lose an hour or two from your life staying in a supermarket crowd to get some food, but in my opinion you don't lose nothing from seeing a movie. Each movie has his own flaws and qualities, but that doesn't mean you have to put a cloud to everyone's sunny day by saying like you are the supreme critic that this sucks. People need to learn to enjoy life more, and those cloudy people need to stay where they feel better and stop ruining the joy of other people.<br/><br/>WATCH IT GUYS! (and now I say this to the fans and a more plausible audience that won't spoil the whole atmosphere after watching. Certainly not watchable for the haters and cloudy people. Please back up!)"

","Who knew that a movie based on a ride at Disneyworld could enjoy such immense success? Incredibly, the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise is one of the most lucrative to date. However, only the first film is considered a critical triumph. The rest are accused of lacking the quality plot, humor, and originality of the first. I agree completely in the case of the third and fourth films, but I feel that the second installment is highly underrated. Few of the flaws that plague the franchise are present here, and Dead Man's Chest is actually a worthy follow-up to the original.<br/><br/>The only thing that makes these movies watchable is, of course, Johnny Depp's fantastic performance as Jack Sparrow. Without him, there could be no Pirates of the Caribbean. His weird mannerisms, hilariously endearing personality, and total unpredictability have made him one of the most beloved characters in movie history. Dead Man's Chest gives viewers plenty more of Captain Jack, and he's just as wonderful as ever. If anything, I almost felt that he was better than in Curse of the Black Pearl. He's given a great introduction in this movie, and he never fails to bring humor to any situation he's put in. He contrasts wonderfully with the serious and somewhat clichÃ©d love story between Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, and is always there to lighten the mood when things start feeling too sappy.<br/><br/>One thing I can say for the first movie is that the evil skeleton crew was incredible. I particularly enjoyed fight scenes where they would flash in and out of the moonlight, transforming. They were beautifully and artfully done. It is clear that in this film, they tried to rival it with the creepy, marine life-infested crew of Davy Jones. While special effects have improved drastically, there is sort of a ""been-there-done-that"" feel to these new characters. Davy Jones himself, though, played by Bill Nighy, was a breakthrough in motion capture effects. Even with a beard of tentacles and complete lack of a nose, his excellent performance shines through and never seems silly. Nighy made quite a wonderful villain, as good or better than Geoffrey Rush from the first film. Plus, something has to be said about the Kraken. That was an awesome creature! It looked amazing, and was built up really well throughout the movie. By the climax, it feels like you're watching an old-fashioned monster movie; and it is great.<br/><br/>Many people complain about the plot of Dead Man's Chest. Personally, I don't assign much importance to the story of movies like this. Admittedly the storyline is rather convoluted, and some may not appreciate the large cliffhanger at the end. But that is kind of the point of the story. The second and third movies were filmed back-to- back, and are really two halves of a whole. They share the same characters, same villains, and some of the same plot threads. Admittedly, there may be too many said plot threads to be completely coherent, but let's be honest: no one came to see Pirates of the Caribbean for the plot. It's either for the incredible action scenes (and boy, are they incredible), Jack Sparrow's character, or Orlando Bloom's face, all of which this film delivers in grand excess. Only in the third and fourth films did the plot to detract from my enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>People will compare Dead Man's Chest to the first movie endlessly, and there's nothing anyone can do about that. But as a sequel or a standalone film, it's not at all a bad movie. While not perfect, it's well-executed, well-acted, and a damn good time. I give it 7 out of 10 stars."
"lisa-vanderwater","7","0","1","12 June 2012"," Review on Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","Hello, Beastie!<br/><br/>The film Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the sequel of the Curse of the Black Pearl, directed by Gore Verbinski. After the first film, high expectations were raised among many people. In this adventurous action movie, Johnny Depp returns as Captain Jack Sparrow. Also the other characters of Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) return to the screen. So the film has got a well-known cast, which makes it a success beforehand, which can turn out either positive or negative for the film. It's set on the Caribbean around the 1750s. The film contains elements from a lot of different genres, for example: action, comedy, fantasy, romance, etc. <br/><br/>When Will and Elizabeth are ready to get married, Elizabeth is thrown in prison for helping Jack Sparrow escape. Will Turner has to go to Jack Sparrow and get his compass. If he gives this to Lord Beckett Elizabeth is set free. In the meantime, Jack Sparrow owes a blood debt to Davy Jones, the half-octopus sea captain of the Flying Dutchman. The only way to escape from his duty is to get help from the voodoo priestess Tia Dalma. She is able to give him the information Jack Sparrow needs to find the key of the magical dead man's chest. Even though the plot isn't very well-written and quite lengthy, the humorous actions of Captain Jack Sparrow, as well as of some of the other characters, make the film worthwhile and funny.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is almost the worst written plot you can imagine. It goes from one subject to another, leaving the viewers completely puzzled. One moment everybody is looking for the magical compass of Jack Sparrow, and the next they are suddenly looking for the key of Davy Jones's chest. When Elizabeth enters the room of Lord Beckett, the audience is likely to get confused how she got there. And if this isn't enough, Elizabeth starts a love triangle with Will and Jack, all out of the blue. It also seems like the characters themselves don't even know what they want and what they are doing. An example of this is that Captain Jack Sparrow has the compass, but he doesn't know what to do with it and how to read it. Neither is there any sense of direction established, just until you watched forty minutes into the film. But the worst thing about this film is that it takes the director two and a half hours to complete nothing. There is a lot happening in the film but in the end everybody ends up with having the same as they had in the beginning: nothing. <br/><br/>Except from bad aspects it also contains various good aspects. For example, the good old humor from the first film returns in the sequel. And of course, Jack Sparrow draws a lot of attention to him again with direct, sarcastic and funny comments. This makes the audience want to keep on watching the film and it makes boring scenes amusing. Another positive aspect of the film is the great amount of spectacular stunts and special effects. This keeps the viewer awake and entertained. For example the numerous sword fights and battles keep you on the edge of your seat. Also the use of CGI is magnificent. The character of Davy Jones is beautifully made, just like the other crew members on the Flying Dutchman. The giant-tentacled Kraken, which appears halfway through the film, is also made by CGI. The appearance of this enormous beast adds some action and amazement to the film. Another good aspect is the use of mattes, during the film it is hard to see what is real and what isn't, this makes you think and try to figure out how they did it. It also makes you get absorbed into the film more, because you accept it as a reality. For example the part when the Kraken appears behind Captain Jack Sparrow, and they also used this technique when the crew members of The Black Pearl swing, captured in the bone cage. The lighting was used effectively in the film: every scene on The Flying Dutchman was quite dark, this created a gloomy mood, also at the wedding the light was quite dim, which created a sad mood and in both cases you could expect some action or drama was about to happen. The sound however is very characteristic for the Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, so when you hear it again you will immediately recognize it and link it with this film. The acting is very good in this film, because although the plot is horrible, they are able to make it a film worth watching.<br/><br/>Overall Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a lengthy film with a dreadful plot, but the humor and spectacular events keep you entertained throughout the entire two and a half hours of the film. Because the first film was such a success, Gore Verbinski is likely to get away with the bad plot, but he probably won't get away with it once more. The use of special effects in this film was amazing and it really got you absorbed in the film. Although it didn't fully meet our expectation that we got after watching the first film, we would still recommend it to our friends and family. Because of the humor, the fights and the stunts."

"Maniac-9","10","0","1","9 March 2012"," The movie that made Depp a box office superstar
","Prior to this movie Johnny Depp had a nice solid Hollywood career that was very well respected by peers and fans alike. But he was never really that much of a box office draw. He was always known for quirky, interesting and odd ball movies but never brought in the masses. It was this movie where he created one of the most hilarious characters with his Captain Jack Sparrow. Depp was able to take what was just a Disney park ride into a major movie franchise because of his charisma in the lead role. I don't think another actor could've pulled off this role and been taken seriously. Most other actors taking the character choices that Depp did here probably would've been laughed out of the theater but Depp just has that It Factor with this role that it was perfectly created for him that it just clicked."

","I think it's a good movie. It's always a sort of excitement in the movie. The action scenes are always funny. The movie has a comedy touch on it. But it's kind of hard to just look at a part of the movie and understand the action in it but if you see it from the beginning it's easy to understand it. The actors are good and. The effects is pretty good to but the not need to be perfect in this movie. I have not seen any goofs. I think the best scene is when jack sparrow and will turner and another guy fights on the beach and Elizabeth Swann stands and yell at them. The story itself is good. Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira knightly fits together all of the fighting scenes with Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is good. The movie never gets boring it is always happening something. The environment is nearly always fantastic when they are in the jungle and when they are on the beach with the white sand and the blue sea."

","Jack Sparrow races to recover the heart of Davy Jones to avoid enslaving his soul to Jones' service, as other friends and foes seek the heart for their own agenda as well.<br/><br/>From the overall success from the first film, they decided to make a trilogy. In the second installment, they continue to do right; but then some wrong. The movie exceeds both in action and plot. Those were the two main highlights and the two that overcame the first. The problem is, the film lost its 'heart' or so to speak. It was not as memorable as the first nor lovable. That not meaning that this one lacks those two. The film has it's moments where it shines through the first and then some that just lowered my liking. Final outcome would have to be a 7. Johnny Depp does another great job, and kudos to the other actors as well; because they did their part well. Aside from that, I found the action scenes stunning! Every time the film drifted off into who knows what, something crazy begins and we're put into pirate-heaven. The cannibal escapee scene was most possibly the best. Then the score still shines through and seriously puts you in a pirate mood. Then the ending... God, I can go on for hours describing how much of a cliffhanger they put us on. I only recall people becoming frustrated and mad over this; but that's what makes endings better. I cannot wait to finish off with World's End and Stranger's Tides because I seriously find this to be one of the most captivating, most entertaining movie trilogies ever. 7/10."

Action, adventure and of course, pirates! From beginning to end, the script kept me engaged, the effects wowed me and the score knocked me off my feet and this was one of those rare movies where I was literally on the edge of my seat, cheering at some bits, covering my eyes in horror at others and I think even a scream or two escaped from my lips.<br/><br/>Not much else needs to be said but I felt it couldn't hurt to add my two cents. This is one of those movies that a lot of people stay away from because it doesn't seem like their ""thing"" but I can assure you that as someone who enjoys indies, dramas and foreign films, I actually had a really great time watching this."

","The unexpected success of POTC: Curse of the Black Pearl (aka Pirates 1) was such that a sequel was inevitable.

In fact, Jones' supernatural crew of half human, half fish cutthroats are one of the high points of Pirates 2, together with an amusing script, a convoluted story, and some fun (and funny) set pieces.<br/><br/>Had Pirates 1 not come first, this would be rated higher, I am sure - the fact that Pirates 1 had set the bar so high (and so unexpectedly) meant that any sequel had a huge amount to live up to: Pirates 2 just about managed it."

","Part two of the Pirates franchise feels like a so-so film, bearing down like a middle sequel to bring you the third installment, much like Back to the Future II did in 1989. However, the film was still up to par as the first, as most Jerry Bruckheimer productions are! The only negative thing I can say is that the scenes involving the cannibalistic islanders was lengthy and sometimes often bigoted and transposed as cannibals when they really weren't. Disney executives and writers need to research better next time before allowing something like that in their films! For that, the film was banned in several countries, costing the film revenue and publicity that they could have otherwise avoided! Overall though, the film did reach viewers and was well received in the United States, and on my scale received 8/10!"

"brando647","9","0","1","12 October 2009"," My Favorite PIRATES Film
","When the first sequel to the immensely successful PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN was released in 2006, it was the recipient of mixed reviews from critics and fans. I can see how the film may have driven off some viewers, with it's seemingly complicated plot and less humor than it's predecessor. I am an avid supporter of this film and find it to be my favorite movie of the Bruckheimer/Verbinski series. The two final films were shot consecutively and the second movie acts as a means of setting up for the final act in part three. The film revolves around the chest containing the heart of Davy Jones and the race to acquire it. Jack Sparrow's hoping to escape a horrible fate at the hands of Jones' pet, Will Turner seeks to free his recently-discovered father from Jones' crew, and disgraced ex-Commodore Norrington wants to regain his life by turning the heart over to the East India Trading Company.<br/><br/>The original cast returns from the first film, with some great new additions. Depp, of course, as Sparrow remains one of the most memorable film characters he's ever portrayed though I will admit some of his lines didn't sit right with me. There were points where I couldn't help but feel some the lines felt forced and didn't fit. I'm still not overly impressed with Orlando Bloom as Will Turner but Keira Knightley brought more to her role this time around as Elizabeth is evolving into a stronger character than we've seen. Also returning, is Jack Davenport as Norrington who receives a more prominent role and becomes invaluable to the sequels. Seeing as how Barbossa was killed in the first film, the sequel was in need of a new villain so, outshining all others, we have Bill Nighy's addition to the cast as what has become one of my favorite film villains...Davy Jones. Nighy brought so much to the character and did a fantastic job bringing a completely CGI character to life.<br/><br/>While mentioning the CGI, you will also note that it's improved since the original film. The character of Jones is so realistic at times you'd be hard-pressed not to think the make-up was done practically. Jones' crew, a mix of half-human/half-sea creatures, look fantastic but suffer at moments from the same issues as the undead pirates from the first film where the CG tends to stand out at times. There have been a lot of complaints that the story was too confusing, but I disagree. I admit I was somewhat confused at first but everything became clear as I was watching the film and had a firm grasp on the story upon my first viewing. Granted, there is a lot going on in this film and it easily fills the 2.5 hour run time but it's not time wasted. My best advice is to relax and enjoy the movie, and if you can, try to pick up on the subtle foreshadowing scattered throughout. DEAD MAN'S CHEST was easily the most enjoyable of this trilogy for me and the surprise at the end, right before the end credits roll, was enough to ensure I'd be back for the third."
"whatever_123","7","0","1","3 October 2009"," Pretty good, with some Flaws...
","I love Pirates of the Caribbean. It's one of my favorite trilogies. Even so, that doesn't mean they are perfect. There were a few things I didn't get.<br/><br/>The romance between Will and Elizabeth was good at first, but towards the end, it's almost like Elizabeth was falling in love with Jack Sparrow instead. Why? Personally, if I were her, I would have chosen Will over Jack any day. SPOILER: Why did she kiss Jack at the end, handcuffs him to the ship, then doesn't even look at Will and lets him think the kiss was for real?? Why did she do that? Also, they didn't really make it clear why Jack and Davy Jones were constantly negotiating. Why does Davy Jones want his soul? I didn't really understand it.<br/><br/>Other than all that weirdness, I thought the rest was pretty cool. Jack Sparrow once again serves as a great comic relief for the movie. The action was as gripping as the first. The animation was great! The new villains, Davy Jones and his crew of barnacle-encrusted fish people, are very creative and it was fun to see all the action they provided. I also enjoyed the sequences of the Kraken destroying ships and bringing them down to the depths of the ocean.<br/><br/>In my opinion, its a great movie, with some weirdness and gross- out moments, but it's great nonetheless."

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's chest isn't quite as good as the original. The first film focused a lot on Jack Sparrow. The sequel focuses quite a bit. Not quite as much as the original, but it still focuses quite a bit. At least it's not like Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's end, where Johnny Depp is only in half of the film. That's not quite what weakend the third film though. This film focuses on things like:<br/><br/>Will Turner, who's one of the main characters, is tracking Jack Sparrow down. Because if he gets his compass, then he get set his love Elizabeth free. But in order for Will to get the compass, Will must get onto Davey Jones's ship and steal a key, where Davey Jones is hiding his heart in a chest.<br/><br/>There is too much going on in Pirates Dead Man's chest. Not that that is a bad thing. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest is has more action and great special effects. At times it can be very gory, I guess that's why the director's name is Gore Verbinski. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's chest isn't quite as good as the original, but it's still a great sequel to a great original. So I think you should see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."

I liked that they had developed her character from the first one where she started off sheltered and helpless in a way and in this one, she's not afraid to defend herself from attack and even going on her own to find Will.<br/><br/>What a brilliant ending to have Barbossa come back into it as I really enjoyed the competing that went on with Jack and Barbossa in the first film so it was good news to see him back in it."

I admit I could do without the love triangle that begins to blossom between Jack Sparrow, William Turner, and Elizabeth. Nevertheless, I found the film enjoyable, without being overly long as the third film was. While Jack Sparrow's character is not played quite to the perfection of the first movie, he still throws in plenty of memorable lines here, including his ""Why is the rum always gone?"" and ""You're not makin' any sense at all."" I have heard complaints about the scene on the island with the sword fight on top of the spinning wheel and how unrealistic the scene is. Who cares if it's unrealistic? These movies weren't meant to model real life. They are just for fun. To anyone who is critiquing these films too hard, just sit back and enjoy them.

","Disney's 2003 surprise hit based on a theme park ride spawns a full blown franchise with this $1 billion earning sequel which garnered a lot of criticism on its release in 2006.<br/><br/>All the main cast from the first film return as Captain Jack Sparrow sees his dept to Davy Jones (a CG Bill Nighy), captain of the Flying Dutchman, called in and destined to be sent to Davy Jones's Locker as the East Indian Trading company takes hold of the seas.<br/><br/>From the opening shot of the impending wedding between Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Knightley) ruined by the intrusion of a thunder storm and the arrival of the villainous Lord Beckett (a slimy Tom Hollander) to the reintroduction of Depp's Captain Jack, emerging from a coffin after escaping a coastal pirate prison where still living pirates are left hanging to have their eyes pecked out by black crows, you know you're venturing into darker waters with this sequel.<br/><br/>And I think that is the main problem many had with this film on its release.<br/><br/>The first film had a wonderful whimsical tone to it, even in its most macabre moments that just seems to be missing at various points throughout the film. It's almost as if the filmmakers have gone darker for the sake of going darker, rather than keeping the lighter tone of the first film (which still would've fitted with this story) There are still fun moments (the rather enjoyable escape from the cannibal island is a wonderful interlude) but not enough of them as the film gets lost trying to set up all the plot points that won't be resolved until the next film.<br/><br/>The film also suffers from that familiar condition of many of todays blockbusters.....it's far too long!!! I honestly think that the judicious trimming of around 15/20 minutes would improve this film further as it does drag its feet at times.<br/><br/>However despite all that, surprisingly, I found myself enjoying Dead Man's Chest more than ever.<br/><br/>I think the film actually improves on repeated viewing's as you have more time to take everything in, especially the many plot points that are spun. There's still much to enjoy in this film, Depp is as wonderful as ever, as is the various crew of the Black Pearl. However the stand out has to be Bill Nighy who does an amazing job (along with ILM) of portraying Davy Jones as the complex, cruel yet heart broken character he is. The FX work on Jones and the Dutchman crew outdoes that of the cursed Black Pearl pirates from the first film, the production and costume design is even more outstanding and the locations look just breathtaking in HD.<br/><br/>All in all it's amazing to think that this film almost didn't get made (Disney came close to pulling the plug very late in pre-production due to worries over the script and cost of the two sequels) but I'm glad it went ahead as the film is very enjoyable, despite its failings. Well worth a re-evaluation 9/10"

","This excitement film ups the auntie from the first film with more fights, more explodings, and more Captain Blark! Yes, John Deep excels again in his pirate costume, running through fields, being chased by crazy Caribbean people, swinging his sword, drinking his whiskey, and generally being great. The King's Army are after him due to the incidents of the first film, so he has sailors coming at him from all directions! Also in addition to this Davey Jones is after him for some reason- he is a monster man, a dead man and he wants to suck Captain Blark into his chest, hence the title. At the other side of the world Orlando Bloomer and Kylie Knightly have get married and are on a quest to find a mystical treasure which will bring them riches and peace and prove that Bloom is fit to be King. This quest brings them back into contact with Blark, and all the sailors, monsters, pirates, dead men, beasties, skeletons, fish, Blarks, and zombies collide in one epic battle. A GIANT sea monster appears, sent by Davey and it wrecks all the ships and eats our hero. The rest of the people and freaks manage to finally scare the monster away and thus begins the race to get the treasure.<br/><br/>Gore Verbinski gives homage to his favourite movies here- indeed it is really his version of Cannonball Run except on the hi seas. Each character has their own ship- some are small and cut through the waves quickly. Others are big and slow, but have lots of weapons to stop the faster ship. The Boulder Brothers ship turns out to be quite disastrous though as it is built from rock and sinks like a stone. Bloomer and Knight reach the treasure but it turns out to be a trap! By touching it, Bloom switches bodies with Blark, is sent down to the ship of the dead where he must spend eternity, rowing the ocean floor in search of Sea Doughnuts. We get a glimpse of his father who will become a major character in the final film, while Blark is transported to a giant never-ending beach (This may be a subtle reference to the Desert in Steve King's Big Tower series). Better than the first two films, but not as good as the last few.<br/><br/>Best Scene: When Blark is chatting up some sea-prostitutes and says 'Oh my, my dear, what a lovely set of coconuts you yield in thine corset' and all 14 of them take turns to slap him! 'You try wearing a Corbet!'"
"TheLittleSongbird","8","0","1","13 May 2009"," Overlong, but this is a lively and hugely enjoyable sequel!
","This film is a little too long, and doesn't quite have the charm of the predecessor. But it is solid entertainment, with a good plot, and consistently good acting, as well as the whole production looking stunning. Johnny Depp is as lovable as always as Jack, and Kiera Knightly is as lovely as ever. Orlando Bloom, while less charismatic than he was in the first movie, is still charming. Jonathan Pryce and Jack Davenport also delight, as does Stellan Skargaard as Bootstrap Bill. But an unrecognisable Bill Nighy almost steals the show as the rather creepy Davy Jones. The special effects and the stunts were very impressive especially with the very scary krakon, so was the outstanding music score and although the script lacks the sparkle of the predecessor, this is a resoundingly entertaining film nonetheless. Oh, and be prepared for a surprise at the end. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
"freemantle_uk","7","0","1","20 April 2009"," My favourite of the series
","Unlike most people who think Curse of the Black Pearl was the best of the Pirates' series, I personally prefer Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Dead Man's Chest starts with Will (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth (Keira Knightley) getting arrested by the evil Lord Becket (Tom Hollander) for helping Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) escape. Becket makes a deal, if Will finds Jack then he would pardon them and more importantly, Jack's compass. Jack is on his own mission when Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) wants to recall Jack's debt for raising the Black Pearl. Here Jack has to run to land before having to play everyone involved against for him to get his own way and save his skin. A sub-plot of the film is Will finding that his father (Stellan Skarsgård) is alive, working for Davy Jones. Bootstrap Bill sets out to do all he can to protect his son.<br/><br/>I will get the problems out the way first. The plot is too convoluted and mixed up. It can lead to confusion and loosing interest. The convoluted plot also leads to the film being too long and a number of faux endings. Finally Orlando Bloom can't act (except in Lord of the Rings). Now to the positives. The action is excellent and you get a lot of sword fights and flint-lock gun fights. An excellent mix of action and comedy is the free way sword fight on the bench. There is comedy which people should enjoy. Johnny Depp is very good in the film, but Bill Nighy does steal the show. Nighy is alway excellent, being the best performer in Love Actually and very good in Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Guest House Paradiso etc... Nighy made a brilliant villain. The special effects are amazing, some of best put to film and I expect most of the people involved will not struggle to find work. Another element I enjoyed was the sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth throughout the film and how she uses it as a weapon against him. I would have like to see more of that.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable enough film."
"jburtroald95","10","0","1","24 March 2009"," Amazing! A truly unforgettable action thrill-ride!
","This film left a terrible impression on me when I first saw it with perhaps overly high expectations after my splendid experience with the original. My initial opinion was that it had a crazy mixed-up messy incomprehensible storyline, that the superfluous Flying Dutchman scenes were far too violent and disgusting and were most intolerable, and that the action scenes were slow monotonous and dragged on and on without getting the point. Though during this first viewing I did feel that there were a few redeeming qualities, such as the awe-inspiring performance of the marvellous legendary Johnny Depp and that fun-filled three-way sword-fight scene involving the giant rolling wheel.<br/><br/>Now after having gotten used to the sheer ugliness of those mutated seamen slaves, accepted the storyline for what it is and enjoying its many twists and turns, begun to laugh and throw myself into those exciting and comedic action sequences and appreciate the truly extraordinary performances of Bill Nighy, Naomie Harris, Tom Hollander and many others I realise that I could never have been more proud of the film's creators for both greatly differing from their approach to the first film and doing it such justice.<br/><br/>Job well done indeed and you thoroughly deserve that Academy Award!"

","This second film in the Pirates trilogy is my personal favorite. Depp is at his looniest, and there's plenty of humor. The film is also very long as many more characters are introduced. The best is Bill Nighy, playing a menacing but jokey Davy Jones. His appearance has to be seen to be believed. Indeed, the Special Effects in this film are a significant improvement over the first film. There's also some crackling chemistry between Keira Knightley and Depp. The film takes its time setting everything up for the superb final hour which includes a sword fight on top of a ferris wheel and humor reminiscent of the three stooges. To top it all, there's also a giant Kraken, though the kraken's attacks carry on too long.<br/><br/>Overall 8/10"

It has death threats, cannibals, voodoo curses, Kraken attacks, a fight atop a water wheel and a terrific villain who looks like a human octopus, sounds like a Scottish sergeant major and ripped his own heart out because he felt like it. As with the previous movie, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio's script is first-rate, with a fine MacGuffin, plenty of crazy twists and some surprisingly intense character moments (particularly between Depp and Knightley), but it's real success is in just being a good old-fashioned pirate adventure; the modern-day equivalent of those old Errol Flynn-Basil Rathbone movies. It also gels cleverly with the previous adventure as many characters return, often in unexpected and amusing circumstances. Hans Zimmer's score is great, and the production design by Rick Heinrichs (Sleepy Hollow) is sensational - creepy and evocative, and a constant mixture of light and dark. Depp is once again irresistible as saucy Jack, with his mincing walk, darting eyes and often incomprehensible delivery, a kind of Jacques Tati meets Alice Cooper. The whole ensemble are great though, particularly Nighy (who looks as if he's wearing makeup but is really all CGI enhanced) as the gruesome Davy Jones, Arenberg and Crook as the two bickering sots from the first movie who used to be ghosts, and Skarsgard (who, unlike everybody else, actually gives a dramatic performance) as the tragic Bootstrap Bill.

","My Take: Bigger and better than the first. A terrific adventure. <br/><br/>It's been an unbreakable rule amongst Hollywood blockbusters that a sequel, although trying to be better than their predecessors, are never really better, something always falls short of its predecessor. Although some sequels have eventually broken that law, it's pretty rare for another sequel that actually is better than the original. PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST breaks that law once more, as it is bigger and surprisingly better than its predecessor, the immensely popular PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL. The budget is eventually bigger, much for inserting bigger and better effects than the original. Not only does it feature a lot of pirates, this one has slimy creatures and a giant Kraken. But even with it's over-commercialization, PIRATES 2 lives up to it's hype.<br/><br/>Personally, the original PIRATES wasn't exactly the best summer movie in years, but it was an unprecedented summer entertainment and it's quite an offer I couldn't refuse. I enjoyed the special effects and action scenes, and then there's Johnny Depp's portrayal as the half-sane pirate Captain Jack Sparrow which provides the film's best charms. This sequel offers practically the same formula, only with new refinements as it is a sequel to a certified blockbuster hit. The special effects are bigger, the action is more abundant and of course, the running time is extended. While the original film was long enough, this sequel is twice as actually long, running at 150 minutes. Nobody wants to stay too long in a packed movie theater for that long, which is probably the films heavy flaws. The film is far too long, with some parts that often lag. The film could cut at least 1 hour without losing much than a large dosage of special effects that could be included as an extra feature on DVD.<br/><br/>Still, while it is even longer than the original, this sequel is actually better and it has more action and thrills than its predecessor. It's definitely longer than the previous film, but this one manages to escape the sequel curse of being but a xerox copy o the first film. This one has a new plot, concerning Capt. Sparrow's life debt with the gruesome undead pirate Davy Jones (Bill Nighy, with a CGI octopus-altered face). The lovable characters of Capt. Sparrow, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley) are back and with their much development and chemistry from the first film, there's no complaining about ""no character development"". The special effects and photography are superb as they should be. Director Gore Verbinski has a lot of fun with his accomplishments on effects, but still manages to accomplish a product that delivers far more appeal that that those of CGI.<br/><br/>A highly recommendable summer attraction. Much more like a theme park ride than a movie, but at that way, it's still terrific entertainment.<br/><br/>Rating: ****1/2 out of 5."

","While not quite as good as the first film, but just as exciting, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest' definitely only serves to add to the lore that now surrounds Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann.<br/><br/>'Dead Man's Chest' goes much more supernatural than its prequel, containing a new villain in the eccentric and mysterious Davy Jones. Thing is, either you're going to love or get creeped out by this underseas devil, and especially his crew.<br/><br/>If you can digest the supernatural elements that Jack is thrown into- once he owes his debt due to the Black Pearl ship having been raised from the depths by Jones 13 years earlier- then this movie will be nearly as enjoyable as the first. However, it potentially will drive you crazy, as everything is left open-ended, particularly with a completely unexplained cliffhanger, that really gives this movie the feel that it is just Part 1 of a two-part series that will be concluded with 'At Worlds End.'"

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was the surprise hit of 2006 in which I had never seen all of the first movie until i found out that the film broke Spider-Man's (2002) original box office record until a year later when the web-slinger would dominate the spot once again. I can see why people love ""Pirates"" in which Johnny Depp plays the bumbling pirate Jack Sparrow who has escaped death in the beginning of the movie while being searched by Will Turner played by Orlando Bloom. Will wants to find Jack in telling him that the soldiers from the first movie have kidnapped Elizabeth (Keira Knightly) and want to trade in a deal that if Jack gives himself up, Elizabeth could go free. More surprises come along the way with Jack wanting to find the heart of Davy Jones where William finds out that he has a father who is a slave to the monstrous beast. Meanwhile Elizabeth escapes her prison thanks with the help of her father where she searches for Will in the seas disguised as a pirate herself.<br/><br/>While the special effects is the standout of the film giving most dead pirates and creatures life, the reason why Pirates of the Caribbean 2 works is because of Johnny Depp's charisma in this movie. I'll get a chance to see the first film but this film will stand out as a reason for me to love Jack Sparrow and the adventures."

","It's very rare that we see a sequel surpass it's original, and Dead Man's Chest is no exception. The original is fresh, inventive, utterly hilarious and one of the most entertaining films of all time. This go around is stale, tedious and blends between overly cheesy and simply odd. However for all of it's flaws, it remains a massively entertaining piece of Grade A blockbuster action. Johnny Depp provides another wildly outrageous and charismatically riveting performance, but the rest of the cast ranges from dry and repetitive, yet still insanely beautiful (Knightley) to some of the worst I've ever seen (Bloom, of course). The story is completely insignificant and wildly convoluted. Jack owes a debt to Davey Jones. Something about a beastie. Sexual tension between Jack and Elizabeth. Just ridiculous reasons to keep letting Johnny be eccentric and hilarious, to provide some perfectly amazing action that is among the most entertaining I've ever seen and, ultimately, to bring in more money. Despite all of the flaws and repetitiveness of the film, the beauty of watching Johnny Gone Wild and the massive quality of entertainment that the film contains makes it completely worthwhile in my eyes."

"shiftyeyeddog","8","0","2","5 July 2007"," A great middle chapter
","First: the movie  It truly is just the first half of one long movie, so I hesitate to ""rank"" it in comparison to the first one, as many have done, until I see the last half (part 3). Depp is as great as ever, Bloom and Knightley hold their own as well as last time, and the supporting cast is excellent. I loved Jack Davenport in this film, with a new take on Norrington, and Naomie Harris brings an intriguing new character to life in Tia Dalma. I found the late-movie 3-way swordfight to be probably my favorite part, mill wheel and all. If there was anything in this film I liked least, it was definitely Davy Jones and his whole gang. I think the whole ""absorbing"" sea life and such is just pretty pointless and goofy, and made for some dumb looking characters and bad CGI (though most of the FX in the flick were seamless and amazing). I know Jones was kind of the main point of the film and the primary villain, but I would've liked him better if he were just a regular pirate, sans octopus head and crab claw. This didn't ruin the movie for me or anything, but was easily my least favorite part (on my third viewing, I even went and watched another movie for about a half hour when Jones' group showed up). I personally can't wait to see where the third one goes. There are more than a few comparisons to be made to the original Star Wars films and even Raiders of the Lost Ark, but those have been more than sufficiently documented elsewhere. I'll just say I have no problem with them, as this trilogy is shaping up to be plenty worthy of a place alongside those.<br/><br/>I don't quite understand some of the criticism people have toward the film. The most frequent are the length and open ending. Lord of the Rings, anyone? Those films were decidedly longer than this one, and had just as open an ending, if not even more incomplete. And as far as running time, I don't think there's any magical maximum that films have to adhere to. If you can't sit still for a longer film, maybe you should wait for DVD where you can break it up. I have also heard people complain that the characters, especially Captain Jack, have become jerks, or as one friend put it ""They spent the entire movie turning everyone into giant a-holes."" I don't see that at all. There are plenty of conflicts even between the heroes, and alliances and loyalties are constantly shifting, but such is to be expected in a PIRATE movie. Everyone is out for their own agenda, and if those goals line up with someone else's, they'll cooperate for the moment."

","It was the best of the movies I saw the summer it came out. Not hard considering the other two major releases were X3, which was pitiful, and Superman Returns which was enjoyable, but had some serious flaws. Pirates easily beat them both. I love Johnny Depp tremendously, and nine times out of ten, his movies are excellent. I was just hoping this wouldn't be the tenth time. It wasn't. If you loved the first movie, if you loved the characters, the setting, the mysticism, heck, if you love The Secret of Monkey Island, go see this film! <br/><br/>Oh, and for those of you who like to, there is an extra scene at the end, so do stay past the credits.<br/><br/>-- Spoilers past this point --<br/><br/>There were less references to the ride this time around, but there were enough references to the first movie to make up for the lack. All the big names are back: Jack, Will, Elizabeth, her father, even Norrington and Barbossa. Davey Jones is excellently played by Bill Nighy, who's got quite the range, and I think he did an excellent job. Will's father was also an important part, and well-played, though I would have liked them to have hired someone with a bit more likeness to Orlando Bloom, given how much they went on about Will's likeness to his father in the first film.<br/><br/>The new nasty in the movies does seem to be Davey Jones and his crew, but there's an underlying historical nasty as well: the East India Trading Company, whose presence is felt from the beginning of the movie to the end. One might call them the first example of true corporate greed (no, I don't need previous examples, thanks). They were so concerned with controlling the flow of goods that they really were the first example of the new capitalism that became the cornerstone of the US. If they couldn't have it their way, they found new ways to bend people to doing what they wanted anyway. The beginning of the movie shows just what lengths some would go to to get what they wanted, even if, in this case, what was wanted was mythical, it wasn't far from historical fact, either. I like that they've downplayed its significance throughout this movie, as I imagine that they will have a much larger roll in the next, given how the movie ended.<br/><br/>Stuff I liked:<br/><br/>* Racing up the cliffs in the cages<br/><br/>* The way they did the cannibals was much more realistic than most ""savages"" are portrayed in these sorts of movies: Jack was their god, therefore he needed to be released, and his flesh to become part of the tribe. Yeah, gruesome, but still...<br/><br/>* Davey Jones's crew were amazing. The choices of each crewmember's affectations of the sea were incredible.<br/><br/>* The Voodoo lady/witch/queen, however you prefer to refer to her, was excellent. So much there that was just *right*<br/><br/>* Elizabeth going off on her own, dressing like a boy, ""haunting"" a ship, all great.<br/><br/>* The explanation of the compass. Very cool idea.<br/><br/>* The three-way fight over Davey Jones's heart, particularly the part on the runaway water-wheel.<br/><br/>Less than perfect:<br/><br/>* I missed having Anamaria on the crew. Is there some sort of contract that says you're not allowed to have more than a small handful of women in speaking roles in action adventure movies?<br/><br/>* I was expecting, from the end of the last movie, that this one would be about the gold again. I'm not sad it's not, but it makes no sense to have that ending, and the evil monkey, if you're not going to use it in some way. Then again, it's always possible they will by the end.<br/><br/>* Bootstrap seemed under-used for someone that was talked about so much in the last movie. I would have liked to see more of him, really. I was pleased about his entrance into the movie, though. Great intro.<br/><br/>All in all, a great movie, and definitely one I will be adding to my collection the moment it's out. Go see it."

","""Dead Man's Chest"" is a great film, full of non-stop fun and thrills. The overall look of the film is mysterious and entrancing. It's the most land-locked film in the trilogy, allowing for more beautiful location shots and slapstick action. The Oscar-winning effects are also amazing, surpassing anything I've ever seen before in a film.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is great, similarly to the first film. Johnny Depp is, again, hilarious as Jack Sparrow. Keira Knightley and Jonathon Pryce also give good supporting performances, though Orlando Bloom is certainly not phenomenal.<br/><br/>The laughs are everywhere, along with the twists and thrills. There are sword-fights, burnings, and a crew of ridiculously stupid pirates. The villains in the film are much more intimidating than Geoffrey Rush's character in the first and third films. Bill Nighy is great as the cruel Davy Jones and the Kraken was one of the greatest creatures ever created on camera. If for nothing else, see it for the laughs and the effects. It's not as good as the first nor the third, but it's still an enjoyable film."

","The first film kept me interested long enough to make me sit all the way through and also made me want to check the the second and whilst I was in a swash buckling mood I said why waste time? So I dived into it straight away. Glad to say that Dead Man's Chest lived up to its expectations and I found it to be better than Curse Of the Black Pearl. Jhonny Depp's performance as the enigmatic Capt Jack Sparrow is the reason why he is fast becoming one of my favourite anti-heroes as this time him and his crew get into more trouble this time with a super-natural , hideous looking foe known as Davey Jones with whom Sparrow had some business dealings and well its time to pay the paper! There are non-stop action and laughs through out this one so thusly it is difficult to pick a favourite moment however the action and violence had been taking up a notch which to be honest was great! and even a little bit or gore to keep everyone satisfied. I was glad to say that all the cast came together and worked together really well, you also so some more character development on various other members of the crew and no silly little sub-plots firing all over the place. The SFX were great and the not to mention the make-up of Bill Nighy who was totally unrecognisable! My only complaint was that it was a little too long and it does require committed watching but with the surprise ending I assure you it will be worth . To conclude Dead Man's Chest is defiantly a great summer time film to check out as it thrills, makes you laugh and entertains you , I just hope At Worlds End will be just as good if not better !<br/><br/>DEAD MAN'S CHEST 8.3 OUT 10<br/><br/>JACK'S BACK !!!"

","Picking up shortly after the end of the first film, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest follows the arrest of Will and Elizabeth on their wedding day for the escape and aiding of Jack Sparrow. They are given a choice, however, which is to find Sparrow and bring him back to stand trial. Agreeing to this, they set out to find and bring Jack back. Along the way, our heroes soon become embroiled in a game with the monstrous Davy Jones, who has also come in search of Jack as it turns out that he owes Jones a debt as well. There's a lot going on in the second Pirates movie. In fact, so much so that the film ends in a cliffhanger that will leave fans crying for part 3 to come out. And while it may seem that much is left unanswered, I'm sure that all will be revealed in part 3 when it arrives. Until that time, fans will have to make due with all the swashbuckling and double crossing going on here."
"StarBored214","7","0","2","1 June 2007"," Not better then the first, but still enjoyable.
","Now, this film was good. It lead to ""At World's End"" perfectly. But some problems make it compared to ""Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom"".<br/><br/>The reason I'm comparing these two films is because they were both alike. They were SO not better then the first, they were plot heavy, and they didn't use much of our favorite characters Indiana Jones and Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>I loved the first movie of Pirates. The story, characters, music, and the special effects really convinced me. In Dead Man's Chest, the visual effects were superior to it's successor, but it used so much of it and CGI that there's no room for Captain Jack! Like the first one, it is plot-heavy and unfortunately the story was ""To Be Continued"" when Jack was eaten, Beckett got the heart and Barbossa surprisingly returned.<br/><br/>Not a lot of heart, but still one of my favorite films."

","Midway through the third installment of Walt Disney's deliriously popular pirate franchise, a character says of Capt. Jack Sparrow (played by Johnnny Depp in what now has to qualify as one of the weirdest characterizations in screen history), ""Is he making this up as he goes along?"" Shiver me timbers, mateys, but one has to ask director Gore Verbinski and his team of wranglers, er, writers, the same question of the entire series.<br/><br/>I did not fall in love like so many others with the first film in the trilogy, ""The Curse of the Black Pearl,"" but I saw its appeal. It was far too long and sloppy, criticisms that have been leveled at parts two and three but which apply to the first movie as well. I can't even really remember the plot. It has something to do with Sparrow's beloved ship, the Black Pearl, being stolen from him by the rival pirate captain Barbossa (the marvelous Geoffrey Rush, bringing some obligatory British class to the proceedings) and his army of undead, and Sparrow's efforts, along with that most boring pair of screen lovers, Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom, to get it back. Depending on your perspective, that plot summary either wraps it up or barely scratches the surface, because ""Pirates"" is stuffed with more subplots than it can handle. Never has so much plot been shoe-horned into a movie (or trilogy of movies) and so much of it not mattered a bit. It turns out that Sparrow is actually undead himself, and some sort of curse need be broken if he is to regain his mortality. Well, it's not ruining anything to tell you that the curse is indeed broken, and loose ends are wrapped up while everything's left conveniently open for a sequel.<br/><br/>That sequel, ""Dead Man's Chest,"" takes everything that is charming about the first episode and pushes it past the limits of the audience's endurance. What a gormless mess the second part is, all furious action and racing around with absolutely no attempt made at coherence. A tremendous amount of plot exposition occurs in this installment. Indeed, the whole film is really set up for part three, yet at the same time is paced as if the entire movie is one long climax. Our consolation is that Bill Nighy makes his first appearance as Davy Jones (no, not the Monkey), looking like a serving of very angry calamari, and taking up the classy British slack that Rush left behind at the end of Part I. ""Dead Man's Chest"" makes no sense whatsoever, and it's not really even very fun. Even in a mindless action movie, one likes to have a vague idea of what all the fuss is about.<br/><br/>So it pleases me to report that the third and (maybe?) final entry, ""At World's End,"" gets more right than not, and provides a tremendous amount of fun. It doesn't even feel overly long, despite its run time of nearly three hours. The ""Pirates"" movies' saving grace is the cast the filmmakers have assembled, and there are moments in this film, when the cast is all together at the same time, that rival ""Star Wars"" for sheer screen chemistry. Rush returns, so we get to enjoy both him and Nighy, and of course Johnny Depp is back, and returns to the inspired performance (and surpasses the downright nuttiness) that made the first installment so memorable. Chow-Yun Fat is this episode's most significant addition, but let's not dwell on him or the embarrassing Asian stereotype he hauls along behind him. There's a huge amount of jokey humour in this segment, perhaps the most in the series, which helps it succeed in becoming what one sensed it wanted to become all along -- a sort of Indiana Jones set on water. My prayers that the pre-pubescent Orlando Bloom would be killed off looked as if they might have a chance of being answered for a brief moment, until the writers cruelly resurrected him as a swarthy pirate captain and give him a dramatic entrance that gave me the biggest (if most unintentional) belly laugh of them all. Why is it that despite his swishing and mincing, Depp still gives the impression that he could kick Bloom's ass?<br/><br/>The ""Pirates"" trilogy will not go down as classics of the genre, but they'll be remembered for wedging themselves firmly in the consciousness of movie-going America. <br/><br/>Grade: ""Curse of the Black Pearl"": B ""Dead Man's Chest"": C- ""At World's End"": A-"

The special effects are stunning (I wish I could've seen it in theaters), and Johnny Depp is as fun to watch as ever. A couple of plot holes don't take from the excitement each scene has to deliver. It is also very funny at times and has a couple dramatic moments as well. It may get a tad overwhelming at times with everything it has got going on, but fortunatley that also makes its two and a half hour running time flow by. It doesn't exactly captivate you as much as the first one did, but it adds the cherry to the sundae with an excellent, semi-cliffhanger ending that gets you twitching for the third enstallment."
"jpschapira","7","0","2","15 May 2007"," Disney...Dream World!
","I was talking to a friend today, about Disney's Theme Parks. About how beautiful they are and about how everything feels like a dream when you visit them. I think it's almost the same with Disney's films: the sensation that everything is a long colorful dream or, and I don't say it to underestimate the films' quality; a long and entertaining Disney ride. <br/><br/>In ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"", as in ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"", you realize that every scene is done in an arranged set, where, sooner or later, every element present, will become something useful for the scene's development; because it is all carefully thought before. Whether the element will work as something that will explode or fall down it doesn't matter; the point is that everything is alive. <br/><br/>With this lively environment, ""Dead Man's Chest"" takes Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow and his crew into the sea again. This time there is now Geoffrey Rush, but a new villain called Davy Jones, played wonderfully by Bill Nighy. The storyline follows the events of the first movie but what's slightly negative is that you will not understand everything correctly if you haven't seen ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"".<br/><br/>The 'Pirate's' writers give too much credit to their audience (and I wonder why they shouldn't, 'Pirates' being such a high-grossing film), expecting them to keep up immediately. This, for the general public is problematic, because usually sequels find a way for the viewer to understand what has happened before, in case they weren't able to watch the first installment. It doesn't occur that way in ""Dead Man's Chest"", but it doesn't mean you can't enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Personally, I find the writer's decision risky and I like it so I don't mind; mainly, because the script is so well written and the connections with the first picture are intelligently placed in it. This trilogy has been blessed with incredible writers, capable of generating humor, adventure and drama not only for the children, also for the adults. <br/><br/>This is worth analyzing: Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio, the writers, are responsible for ""Shrek"", the best Dreamworks' computer animated film and one that finds the balance between kids and grown ups, with something for each. They're responsible for ""The Road to El Dorado"", one of my favorite animated films and Dreamwork's best film in 2-D animation. Finally, they crafted the script of ""The Treasure Planet"", one of the few good Disney animated films after the change of working team; where they also found the balance I mentioned above. <br/><br/>The trilogy has also been blessed with incredible actors. Johnny Depp reprising the one and only Captain Sparrow, disappearing in the role and owning the film as is his custom. Keira Knightley's Elizabeth comes back and, although not as important as in the first movie, she makes the character look more real, with fewer make up and more dirt in her face; showing that she's not a 'princess' and that she is a woman with determination; I'm looking forward to the final growth of Knightley's character. And Orlando Bloom, maybe not as incredible at the rest, but accompanied by an incredible cast.<br/><br/>Lastly, the trilogy is been blessed with a gifted director: Gore Verbinsky; who was chosen for the franchise after having made only a couple of films. Completely different in genre, the comedy ""Mousehunt"" and the horror remake ""The Ring"" were both equally complex to direct. Verbinsky took the risk and didn't fail Bruckheimer with 'Pirates'. He's also widened his versatility by directing the arty ""The Weather Man"". <br/><br/>Going back to my main point, you can take ""Dead Man's Chest"" as a long colorful dream or a long and entertaining Disney ride. Whatever the case, one thing is certain; it is entertainment for all the family. Oh, I almost forgot: Hans Zimmer is a genius."
"kosmasp","8","0","2","5 May 2007"," The critics hated this ... so what?
","This movie wasn't made to satisfy the critics. It was made for the fans of the first Pirates movie (and of course for the Captain Jack Sparrow aficionado in most of us!). But still why do some people despise this movie? <br/><br/>It's simple they point out, that it's not enough story to justify the running time. Although this is right to a great extent, it's not what you should be looking for in this movie. This movie was made to entertain, nothing more and nothing less. And although other movies do try that too (some fail others succeed), this one has Johnny Depp. It's as simple as that. Of course other actors are good here too, but the main attraction is Cpt. Jack.<br/><br/>If you have seen the first one, you will eventually see this one too, so don't resist the urge to see it and don't listen to some of those critics, telling you it's a waste of time! It's up to you to decide, if you like it or not! <br/><br/>(a last little note: The fabulous line from the trailer said by Will Turner: ""Never mind, let's go!"", has gone awol ...

She gets better every time I see her.<br/><br/>I also have to give props to Jonathon Pryce (The Rachel Papers), Naaomi Harris (28 Days Later), and all those fantastic people who did the makeup for this film.<br/><br/>I certainly will be there for the next chapter."

At least the original movie had an ending.<br/><br/>Up to the lack of an ending the movie was almost as good as the first one.

","""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" (2006) <br/><br/>Directed By: Gore Verbinski <br/><br/>Starring: Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, Jack Davenport, Billy Nighy, & Jonathan Pryce <br/><br/>MPAA Rating: ""PG-13"" (for intense sequences of adventure violence, including frightening images)<br/><br/>""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"" was one of the best movies of 2003. It sported amazing visuals, great performances (particularly from Johnny Depp), and an interesting and imaginative story. It was creative and colorful and completely engaging. Through this movie, we developed great bonds to the three leads and encountered countless supporting characters, all of whom were diverse and complex. It was a movie that changed the way we looked at Disney. The studio, which once only produced family-oriented animated films, had grown up and had done so amazingly. I have always felt that the second film in a series is a make or break deal. It will either continue the original's quality or will fail. There is only a small margin in between. We saw the original ""Star Wars"" series flourish with ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and we have seen other series fail miserably with their second installments. I was worried that ""Dead Man's Chest"" would flounder horribly and then what could have been the ""Star Wars"" of the new millennium would end up being a massive disappointment. But, I still had high hopes. So, did I get the second installment that ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" deservedor was this a sinking ship? <br/><br/>Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp), the flamboyant and unethical pirate that we all know and love, is backand, not surprisingly, he has made another enemy: Davy Jones (Nighy), himself. Facing eternal damnation, Jack must race to appease the most notorious sea villain ever devised with the help of Elizabeth (Knightley) and Will (Bloom), both of whom have found themselves in a spot of trouble. Just before they were to be married, they were arrested for aiding a pirate and they will be hanged unless Will can track down Jack and return him and his magical compass to Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander) who controls their fate. But, nothing can prepare these three adventurers for the wrath of the Kraken, the most terrifying sea creature that has ever lived.<br/><br/>I must admit that ""Dead Man's Chest"" is not quite as good as ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" and, despite amazing performances and special effects, there are a few flaws. However, when everything was said and done, ""Dead Man's Chest"" is far better than most sequels are and actually manages to keep the original film's reputation in place. It is a funny, entertaining, and wondrous film that has one major problem that seems to plague everything else: it is far, far too long. Though only seven minutes longer than its predecessor, it feels far longer, because there are extended periods where nothing interesting happens and it feels as though the scenes are packed with mere fluff that do not add anything to the final product. Ultimately, it makes the movie far too heavy and cumbersome than it should have been. What should have been an easy, completely entertaining watch (as the original is) ended up leaving me squirming in my seat.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp is one of the best actors of our generations. He always gives charismatic and deeply endearing performances that just always work. Captain Jack Sparrow is probably the best character he has ever filled and he plays the part beautifully. Keira Knightley is a surprisingly talented young actress in Hollywood who proves that holding a cute dog and prancing around in short skirts is not enough to earn respect from serious movie fans. Knightley always delivers solid performances (yes, even in ""Domino"") and Elizabeth Swann is a part that could have been played by any actress with half the talent that Knightley hasand yet she manages to give it a certain spark that makes the part all the more fulfilling and fun to watch. Orlando Bloom always gives his best performances in these sweeping epics and here is no difference. He understands epics and, though his performances in more modern-themed films have been good, this is really his element. Despite being about thirty minutes too long, ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"" succeeds where most sequels fail in that it manages to recreate the beauty and the wonder of its predecessor. The world in which our pirates reside is expanded upon without being completely reinvented. I enjoyed this movie and had a very fun time watching it. It's the sequel I wanted.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Creative and entertaining, ""Dead Man's Chest"" manages to overcome its lengthy running time.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 8/10 (A)"
"Hitchcoc","8","0","3","20 February 2007"," It's Fun, But Does Anyone Know When to Stop
","Sometimes I think they sell movies by the pound. This is a pretty delightful tale. The sea creatures, the special effects, Johnny Depp's prancing, tilting Jack Sparrow, interesting rules of the sea, Davey Jones. But it is an eternity. Just like the first one, I thought it would never end. What could be much more suspenseful and captivating is dragged on for two and a half hours. A snip here and there would have done wonders for this film. One thing that always bothers me is the complexity of the hero's task; we are submerged in a whirlpool of details. At times I think the characters themselves are confused by what's going on. How could they know?<br/><br/>Still, it's nice to see someone put forth the effort to tell a really nifty adventure yarn. The sea puts forth obstacles that we don't have on terra firma. It has its own legends and its own being, and it's really quite wet. I like the hammer head guy and the octopus-like Jones. Obviously, the makeup people put in a lot of overtime. It also sets up episode three. See it, but it's quite an investment."

","Although this is a great movie and one of my favorites of 2007, I cannot help but feel that something from the first ""Pirates"" was missing. So I sat down and tried to put a finger on exactly what it was that left me longing for more from this movie.<br/><br/>At first, I was thinking it was just the length. The movie was long with no solid conclusion, so that makes for immediate second thoughts both by critics and movie goers alike. But really, that just wasn't it. So I focused back on the first movie, and looked at exactly what it was that made the world fall in love with it back in 06'. I considering that It may have just been that the whole idea of a crew of sea creature ""pirates"" with a squid-faced captain and a giant-squid hit-man just wasn't the plot viewers were looking for. Not satisfied with that, I accepted the storyline as it was and moved on. After a few months of watching the two movies again and again, I think I have found out what elements are missing.<br/><br/>""I think he's telling the truth. If he was telling the truth, he wouldn't have told us! That is, unless he knew you wouldn't believe the truth, even if he told it to you."" This example from ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" between Johnny Depp's character and two Royal Guardsmen is a prime example of a well thought out, cleverly written script. The humor didn't rely on crude jokes or silly antics. The sheer cleverness of the plot itself kept the viewer interested from start to finish regardless of the shows length.<br/><br/>For me, I could kind of tell that the production of this was rushed. My thoughts only proved when I watched the bonus features on the DVD and realized they hadn't even finished the script as they headed out to film. I also felt that the over the top impossible action took away from the classic Pirates feel of #1. The rolling seqences with the waterwheel and the bone-cage turned me off a bit due to the sheer fact that there is no way that would happen that way. I have a feeling that Will and Mr. Norrington would be a little more then dizzy after a ride like that.<br/><br/>My last point to touch on here is the lack of immersive settings. I felt that Tia Dalma's shack and Tortuga were done very well, but compared to sets such as Port Royal, the original Tortuga, and the Isla de Muerta from the first movie, the ocean shots that made up a good half of ""Dead Mans Chest"" were plain and didn't really give me that immursive feeling I wanted from the sequel.<br/><br/>In conclustion, despite my tone in this summery, I really did love this movie and I could have written an entry twice this long on the movies pro's. But instead, I wrote this entry with the hope that ""At Worlds End"" will bring us back to that wonderful world of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"""
"KathrynS01201","7","0","2","2 February 2007"," Well done, but bad ending
","I waited until this movie came out on DVD, as the movies are simply not in our budget much these days. My daughter and I were much anticipating this one to be better than the first, as well it was, had it not been for the ending. The ending was so open ended, it made me feel like us feel completely let down. I know they are going to make another sequel,and this is why, but the ending without Jack, and some victory was not a good ending at all. It left us feeling sad and regretful.

"MeloDee","8","0","2","31 January 2007"," Why have I been reviewing all of the part twos?
","That will remain a (partial) mystery. Why this movie was not as good as the first, however, will not be.<br/><br/>The movie was just a little too ""goofy"" for my tastes, in that typical Disney fashion. It failed to balance comedic silliness with seriousness as well as its predecessor.<br/><br/>Secondly, for the first time, I started to truly dislike Will's overly virtuous character and his often ill-timed showings of bravado. Whether the fault lies primarily with Orlando Bloom or his character is unknown, but I felt that Bloom's performances were a little too wooden this time around. In addition, Will's oft-brash behavior seems to lack consequences. When you see his run-ins with the villain of this movie, a squid-like version of Davey Jones, you will understand my sentiments.<br/><br/>In general, Davey Jones was a ""suitable"" villain for the second film, being neither perfect nor absolutely terrible. I feel that Barbossa from the original movie was more balanced and fun. He was a ""bad"" guy who wasn't exactly bad, thus providing ample excuse for his lack of cruelty. Davey Jones, on the other hand, is heartless- in the full literal sense if you get what I mean- and because of this, the writers are forced to give him some out of character moments to prevent him from killing Will. He's also paired with the typical idiotic crew, perfect for holding back the otherwise unstoppable villain enough to allow the heroes juuussst the wiggle room they need to escape all the disastrous situations they seem to get into. The writers also saved Davey Jones from total character-suicide by making him have a curse (which was never explained) that prevents him from getting on land, or even within 10 feet of the shallows. This means he is forced to depend on the aforementioned stupid crew, rather than be stupid himself.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie was at least as good as the original, with even more twists, and the much-welcomed reappearance of a two very specific characters from the first film. The major problem with judging the plot, however, is that we don't even get to see how it all ends! This movie follows a trend set by the first two Lord of the Rings, ending exactly where the first film is going to start off with no warning whatsoever. I found this a little disappointing- especially since I embarrassingly didn't know about the third one for some reason when I was watching the second. Still, it wasn't enough of a pain in the butt for me to detract any points from the film's rating.<br/><br/>If you feel like I haven't said very many good things about the movie, well, keep reading- that's coming. Then right after that, a few more bad things, then my conclusion.<br/><br/>The good news is this; that wonderfully piratey theme song that gave the first Pirates a lot of its appeal is back in full force. The stunts and choreography in the film are still as amazing and tasteful as in the first- if you detract the few goofy ones close to the beginning of the film. Jack Sparrow is as witty, endearing, and as drunk as ever. Elizabeth, still gorgeous and kick-ass without being annoyingly pro-girl-power, is taking an even bigger role in this movie than in the first one. I for one do not mind.<br/><br/>In fact, one of my favorite scenes in the movie was Elizabeth and Jack's discussion about ""curiosity"". I think Johnny Depp and Keira Knightly stole the entire show and left Orlando Bloom standing in the dust.<br/><br/>Good news aside, I am now free to address the one scene in this movie that left me grinning in a combination of embarrassment, annoyance, and amusement.<br/><br/>I was proud of Pirates of the Caribbean for introducing its own unique flavor, spirit, or whatever it is you choose to call it into theaters and DVD shelves everywhere. This is why I wondered exactly why they chose- like Superman Returns, V for Vendetta, the One, and other films that I cannot at this moment recall- to incorporate Matrix-like effects into their movie. In just the film where I thought that I was safe from incredibly slow-moving flying bullets, they sneak one in.<br/><br/>Sure, it was well timed, and it was just one bullet. There were no slow kicks or time-defying dodging of sword thrusts and/or punches in the film. Still, it was just a little over the top, and worthy of detracting a tiny fraction of a point.<br/><br/>Well, despite all, I still loved the film, I still recommend the film, and I still desperately want to see the last? installment."

And while I still can't understand how anyone would prefer this to the original film, repeated viewings have caused this entry to grow on me considerably.<br/><br/>My biggest problem is still that they spent so much time repeating jokes and situations from the first film instead of delivering something new. In fact, it's all the ties to COTBP that really hurt this one. They had an opportunity to tell any number of amazing stories in this world. The way that the Indiana Jones series took the same character and supporting cast and dropped them in the middle of a brand new adventure each time out. Same people. Different story. I really thought that's what this franchise would end up being like. And even on the writer's commentary they acknowledge that this was an option but instead decided to try and unify the movies and turn it into a trilogy where each one was strongly connected to the others. I think this was a mistake. Soooo much time is spent finding excuses to get the characters back together and keep them tied into each others stories. And perhaps if it had seemed more effortless this would have been okay. But it feels like they're grabbing at straws and relying on your love for the first one. But nothing in this film is as clever, funny, or awe inspiring as COTBP.<br/><br/>But it's certainly not a total failure either. The cannibal island sequence, while having nothing to do with the overall plot, is an amazing piece of film-making. The stunt work there is just phenomenal. And it's the perfect balance of humor and breathtaking action. I believe it's the strongest chunk of the film. Which is odd considering it does little to move the plot along. I also love the three way sword fight near the climax. I've heard complaints that it goes on too long but I was too enthralled to notice. I thought it was expertly devised and executed. These two moments made it feel as if I were watching something I'd never seen in a movie before.<br/><br/>But the exposition scenes seems endless and it hinders character development because so much time is spent talking about what's happening. And then talking about it some more. And some more. And then some more. And then when the characters are given new places to go it just feels off. The biggest offense being Elizabeth's sudden attraction to Jack. Their dynamic in the first film was perfect: him thinking she was hopelessly in love with him and her being completely repulsed by him. It seemed like a lame attempt at a love triangle. And while the commentary did clear up their intentions a little bit, I still feel this was a mistake. I just never bought into it.<br/><br/>I was secretly hoping they'd shy away from the supernatural stuff this time out. In the original, aside from the curse itself, it felt as if this was all taking place in a some kind of real world. In this one that's impossible. This is like a whole other universe. While I dig Bill Nighy as Davy Jones (and WOW is that CGI incredible) I don't think he holds a candle to Barbossa. And with Barbossa's crew we had unique characters with their own personalities and not just cardboard cut out villains who are pretty much indistinguishable from one another like Jones' crew. And the whole thing with the Kraken just felt like it belonged in some other movie. That was really pushing the supernatural elements. At least for my taste.<br/><br/>There's still A LOT to like about the movie, but like I said... I don't think it comes close to the original. It's too bloated, overly-complicated, and shamelessly steals most of its humor from COTBP. I hope At World's End fares better. But I still wish they'd concentrated on making stand alone films instead of relentlessly winking at the audience with in jokes to the original."

","wow!! i just finished watching and its easily one of the best movies I've ever see. it's one of those movies with a little bit of everything. i thought it was a bit dramatic and one of those movies that has you on the edge of the seat. i thought it was sad at the end and exciting in the wheel of fortune scene and even a slight bit of romance, with Elizabeth an d will and Davy Jones fatal romance. the acting was amazing and you can tell that the actors put their heart and souls into the movie. everything was perfect the music, acting, excitement, drama, betrayal in some cases, glorious....i mean what can i say the movie was perfect, way better than the first one."
"siseo05","7","0","2","12 January 2007"," Good but not great
","I really did enjoy this movie. I actually boycotted CotBP for a long time because absolutely EVERYONE was talking about it, and I have this rebellious thing, I guess. Anyway, I finally saw it and loved it, and I went to see DMC the second day it came out. When we were walking out of the theater, my friend asked me which one I'd liked more, and we both agreed that we needed some time to absorb the second movie before we decided.<br/><br/>And of course this movie has good parts--I bought it, I will watch it again and again, and when we had a Chinese-food-and-DMC-watching party tonight, I packed up and was out the door in two seconds, and not just for the food.<br/><br/>But this movie has gotten SO MUCH HYPE, and I really don't believe it deserves it all. In typical sequel form, I don't see that it has lived up to its predecessor, mostly in that it tries too hard to live up to it. Every time you turn around there is a recycled joke, most notably the rum joke (probably because of its original success). One subtle reference might have gotten a laugh, but they totally beat you over the head with it. ""Why is the rum always gone?--If it were, there'd be rum.--Hide the rum.--Then use the rum."" The dog-and-keys joke, the ""hello, poppet"" (although that didn't seem so annoying to me as just odd when they said it), even the ""Captain Jack Sparrow"" line...I like it to a point, but after we know it, it's tiring to continually be reminded of it. I suppose they were trying to make a point about Elizabeth's character with her interjection at the beginning, but that was definitely an instance of overusing lines.<br/><br/>I don't think that Jack's line of ""You will always remember this as the day..."" gets old, maybe ever, since he always says it with such bravado, and because of the context of the line itself. They only use that line once, anyway, and it's a line that's been known for its changeability; Ted and Terry keep coming up with new ways to present it, so even though it's brought up again and again, it's never the same twice.<br/><br/>This is a great movie as far as action goes. I won't, can't, dispute that. The action starts at the beginning and goes right on through to the end--maybe without enough pauses for the more tender audiences, I guess, but it's not boring. It also mixes humor with its action, which makes it more enjoyable to watch. The big three-way-duel comes very specifically to mind here.<br/><br/>I won't bother too much with the cast...if you saw and liked the main cast from the first film, then you will probably like them again here. Knightley returns as a much more tomboyish figure; I'm still not entirely sold on the plausibility of this drastic change. Norrington's return really gives Jack Davenport a chance to show off his acting abilities. And Tom Hollander, a new addition but one I'm growing to like, appears as the smug Lord Beckett, an interesting change from his last film with Knightley, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.<br/><br/>I have heard some complaints about the overall feeling of this movie, though, its sort of fantastical world. It's true, in CotBP we start out in a very reality-based setting and move into the fantasy world; here we're in the fantasy from start to finish, and the best ""reality"" times are in Port Royal, with Beckett--until, of course, we get to Davy Jones's heart at the end, when the two worlds meet.<br/><br/>In another way these action sequences do detract from the film. Without ever slowing down for a break, it's hard to step back and think about what's happened, and it's a great deal more difficult to really characterize anyone, I think. The main-main characters (Jack, Will, Elizabeth, even Norrington and the Governor, to an extent) have been fleshed out nicely, between this movie and the last, and I see that Beckett is on his way, but our villain--what happened to our villain? We got a story, albeit an interesting one which implies there will be more, but he still seems rather remote to me. There was so much to-do made over the heart, the key, and Jack's part in it all, that the motive behind it all (supposedly a woman) kind of got left out except in the convenient backstory. So if we're supposed to believe he's all bitter over a woman, it doesn't come across very well. Just a few more introspective scenes could easily solve these questions of character, but we're so busy watching ships blow up and people swashbuckling that we kind of forget about everything else. The Kraken, I do admit, is impressive to watch. Someone give Special Effects a hand for that one, especially at the last scene.<br/><br/>It's a fun ride (ha, didn't mean that as a joke...), so I believe you will enjoy it. I highly recommend seeing it at least once, if only to say you've seen it. Don't be like me and miss out on a good film because you feel like you're jumping on a bandwagon--even if it doesn't deserve all its hype, it does deserve a great deal of it."
"atvnut44","6","0","2","6 January 2007"," Favorite Parts? One's you re-wind to watch again
","There are a lot of funny parts in P.O.T.C. 2 of them MY personal favorites are this: <br/><br/>1.) When Davey Jones and Capt Jack are talking about the worth of a soul and Davey Jones makes that little ""pop"" sound. B.T.W. Davey Jones is a nasty looking feller.<br/><br/>2.) When Jack Sparrow (CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow) makes his way on back on board the Pearl, and says ""...now where's that monkey? I want to shoot something!"" <br/><br/>3.)Next, when The jar of dirt gets dropped and smashes on deck and he runs down and asks, ""Where is it? Where is the Thump-Thump?""

"TribalWarriorPrincess","10","0","2","31 December 2006"," Typical Jack
","Jack Sparrow continues to be full of surprises. I knew he was crazy, but I didn't think he was stupid enough to make a deal with Davy Jones. That's actually no surprise though, he'd trade anything for the Black Pearl, even his very soul. This is a great movie, however, and I enjoyed it a lot. However; I do have a couple problems with it: 1. That part in the beginning where the guy gets his eye pulled out by a crow was very graphic (I'm deadly afraid of crows now). and 2. Why was no one surprised to see Pintel and Ragetti again? They were part of Barbossa's crew. Did anyone even recognize them? Here's an alternate scene I came up with which I think they could have done:<br/><br/>Elizabeth Swann: (seeing Pintel and Ragetti again for the first time) You! Pintel: Oh, you remember us poppet? (Elizabeth slaps him and Ragetti) Ragetti: I take it that's a yes."

","Dead Mans Chest is a highly entertaining film,at times a bit overly long but we can forgive that as its so action packed with so many really clever stunts and original ones at that.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp plays Captain Jack Sparrow the campy drunken pirate to the hilt, his just as funny in this instalment as he was in the first,even more so.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom is as dependable as always,in his usual smooth swashbuckling style.His is the sort of character you haven't seen since Errol Flynn or Douglas Fairbanks in all the Robin Hood type movies. I think the filmmakers of Dead Mans Chest went way back in time to remodel their styles in the character of Will{Orlando Bloom}and it works.<br/><br/>Kiera Knightly does a fine job as Elizabeth who is becoming more and more like a female pirate the more you see her.But as she turned bad?This question along with many others is why we have to watch the third instalment when its finally released.<br/><br/>Jack Davenport i would have liked to have seen more of,he appears in the film quite late,he is always interesting to watch even if he doesn't get much screen time.<br/><br/>Dead Mans Chest is just as enjoyable as The Curse Of The Black Pearl in fact i think there are better stunts in this one that are going to be hard to equal in the third instalment.Warning here--there are many lose ends that need to be tied up which are going to make you crave for the next film. But i suppose we can wait."

It continues the adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow, and they still kept the sword fighting spirit up with more sword fights than the first movie! This is a funny and action filled movie!

","SPOILER- I liked this one better because I liked the new stunts and characters and everything about this film! But, the main reason I like this better is because it has funnier comedy better adventures and Jack Sparrow being well, Jack Sparrow! My 3 favorite adventures in this one is where Jack and his crew are falling in the big ball made of wood, where the cannibals make Jack Sparrow there king, and last but, not least is when Jack is trying to get his necklace back when it falls while he is upside down! That part was really funny, I loved it and all 3 of the other parts!

","I think this film is excellent, Jack Sparrow doesn't fail again and keeps you giggling, and if you see it with a jumpy friend thats even funnier! I would recommend it, even more so if you liked the first film. I would say to understand this film seeing the curse of the black pearl mite be a big bonus! The film does leave you with mixed feelings, The main feeling would be whens the next one! Definitely check this out. There are parts of the film that are jumpy, and i do believe that some bits are quite graphic for a Disney flic, different but something different for them making it seem to myself personally much better because it looses its edge as a child's film, although a 12 i wouldn't take younger easily scared children, mite make the imagination run wild. The film has the twists and turns you want the action usually expected and you can really get into it, and purchasing the film on DVD with all those juicy bonus features definitely makes it top notch. i don't know anybody YET that hasn't enjoyed it, but i completely understand that not everybody is the same we don't all like the same films/music/people, if we did wouldn't the world be great?? :) peace <3"
"TonyG-7","8","0","2","22 December 2006"," Very good film
","I rarely see action films and resisted seeing the first film because it sounded too silly, despite the presence of the magical Johnny Depp. Eventually, though, I did see it and loved it. This gave me very high expectations for the second. For much of it, I was awestruck and, for a while, thought it was better than the first. However, as it dragged on the on, I started getting weary, wishing it would just wind it self up. An example is the water wheel sequence, which was initially clever and well-done but just went on way longer than necessary. I got the joke! Much like the 2nd Lord Of The Rings (which REALLY bored me) and Superman Returns (which I generally enjoyed), it could have easily been cut more judiciously. Despite that, I recommend you see it. I think you'll have a good time! One thumb up! 8/10."

"rjcroton","7","0","1","20 December 2006"," Contrived first half, great second
","Contains MINOR Spoilers, not Plot integral When I sat down to watch this film I had mixed expectations. Many said it was a great film, but others I knew (and frankly respect their film opinion more) said it was mediocre. I fall between these camps, personally. The film is a good romp, but frankly pales in comparison to the lovable first film. Remaining is the Keira ""Pout"" Knightly as Elizabeth Swan being a wannabe pirate (let's face it, she doesn't do much), Orlando ""Only Good at Stunts"" Bloom and Johnny ""Weird in a Good way"" Depp as the principle characters. One gripe I have with this film, and it's a large one, is that it tries too hard. Both in having to reference the first film to satisfy fans, and whenever these appeared I cringed. Physically CRINGED. It's not as if the new characters are particularly well cast or well written. Davy Jones is a particular hate figure for me, as he seems to embody the MUST HAVE CGI culture. To be honest, the character grated, and considering how much screen time he had and how integral he was to the plot, this knocks off a Star on its own. If I'd made the film, I'd simply cast Christopher Lee as Davy Jones and have him more of a daunting villain. Although cool, the crew of the Flying Dutchman border on the insane in terms of design. It wasn't explained in the film how 100 years of service on a ghost ship could change you into a Hammerhead Shark-Human hybrid. The first half of the film is VERY contrived, to be honest. It's far too far fetched for me, and I'm a big fan of complicated plots. The Second half saves this film from oblivion. It seems to become more like the first film, and that's no bad thing. If the film had continued the way it had, I may have turned it off and watched the News. But I stuck with it, and found it a rewarding film. The next film needs to avoid the pitfalls the first half of Dead Man's Chest does, such as over-reliance on references to other films in the franchise, and to avoid a Matrix-style slump into complicatedness and poor philosophy with an absolute reliance of special effects. The action was good, if a bit long-winded in some cases, but the film is a decent watch. Needless plot lines aside, like the whole island sequence with the natives, and Elizabeth on the ship tricking the sailors and the 'Oracle' woman, this film has a pretty weak main plot. The first film was slightly jarring in this respect, and this is shot and edited in such a manner that it takes leaps of the imagination to get you through the film. This is coming from a guy who got Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind when he first saw it, so be prepared for a second watching if you wish to get the plot. Don't let your parents watch it: they'll probably hate it, as this is nowhere near the Errol Flynn style swashbuckling yarn like the first until the second half when it seems to begin running. 6/10"

But, also, tell me.....there's a scene in the early part of the movie when the characters are standing outside on the balcony in Port Royale (I think).

I think the third one will be a pleasant surprise. We will hopefully learn more about captain Barbnossa and his past which has been unheard of except when talking about Jacks mishaps on the Black Pearl. This movie had to much of a grim Tim Burton feel to it instead of Disney which is why I hope they bring back the Disney feel in the third one. The cannibals thing was a little far fetched even though I realize it was to bring comedy into the movie which they succeeded in doing."

","In the first Pirates edition, we are enthralled by all of the new characters and excitement, and everything is new. In the second, the primary characters become more known and developed, and the good and bad (or thereabouts) come to final conflict.<br/><br/>In this third edition, the writers succumb to a more lackluster plot, scattered with various complicated and less exciting sub-plots. New characters, more worthy of Disney action-figure profits, are introduced.<br/><br/>The acting is still top-notch. But the plot is weaker, and we found ourselves frequently more bored in the lulls than enthralled as with the previous two Pirates movies. The plot plays up all of the previous primary characters as though trying to rally forces, but each becomes embroiled in the sub-plots, and the overall continuity and excitement suffers greatly as a result."

Was fun to see the characters back in action against a new enemy ( a big sea creature amongst many other horrors from the deep). Was saddened that Barbosa wasn't in this one. I enjoyed it but I did not rate this as high as the first. All the way through the film (and I hope I was the only one), I got the sense of seen it before. I actually could easily go to make dinner and come back to find I hadn't missed much. Two of the characters are actually starting to annoy me. Miss Swan and William Turner. Try hard was all I could think of. The film did have some nice touches but the sense of adventure was pretty much lost when you could predict what was going to happen. Nice touches being the excellent CGI (the sea captain, I could even tell who was acting it). Some excellent stunts and huge ship fights didn't fail to disappoint. Still I'm looking forward to the next film, and who wouldn't. It's like Harry Potter. You might begin to hate but you cannot stop once you've started!"

","Alright, the first movie was awesome! It brought back to life what Disney can do for family viewing. Growing up in the days of ol' time movies being rerun on the Disney Channel, I grew to love Disney very much. With classics like Old Yeller, Summer Magic, Swiss Family Robbinson and the like, I loved family type movies with no gross nudity, a story line that is not only enchanting, but also engrossing and will keep you on your toes.<br/><br/>Now, with the second ""Pirate's"" movie of the trilogy having just come out on DVD today, I just had to go out and rent it. (My husband though had the ending ruined for him when his manager accidentally told him what happens just a mere three days before it's release.) So, I got to the store to ensure that we got a copy (no problem there, still over 60 copies when I left--with 200 for Miami Vice gathering dust, ha!) I rushed home, the excitement on his face! We put it on as soon as our PS2 stopped being a punk and started playing, and with many ""shhhs!"" to our 4 year old, we were able to watch the movie.<br/><br/>We loved the first movie. We thought it was funny, greatly casted and even to this day we spout many of our favorite lines from the movie. ""Why's the rum gone?"" The sequel however falls short slightly. Don't get me wrong, we both really really liked it. Some of the fight scenes were just awesome; choreographed perfectly, the visual effects up to par with other great films as Titanic (think of the switchover of the ship from Rose's retelling and then the shots of it underwater) and the Matrix trilogy.<br/><br/>However, even though the film is supposed to leave you knowing there's a third coming, it seemed short. Yes, it's 150 minutes long, but the story dragged at times so when you got to the ending, you were hopping it would continue. I guess they wanted that so you can't wait for the 3rd and rush out and see it. Just keep that in mind as it ends, that there is more to come.<br/><br/>I'm just glad it's not like the Harry Potter series where it's years between films. Pirates of the Caribbean 3: At World's End is to come out in the summer.

And hey, the actors are good looking....<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom plays dashing Will Turner, who has never met his father. Keiria Knightley is cast as Will Turner's Fionce... a lady who loves her man but can also kick butt! Jonny Depp is CAPTAIN jack sparrow. A pirate who can be described in many words. Basically he owns a compass that doesn't always point north. <br/><br/>9 out of 10... a great sequel... can't wait for the next one!"
"JDepp_Fan","10","0","2","4 December 2006"," More entertaining than the first!!!
","The sequel was more action packed than the first. There are new characters introduced which makes the adventure exciting. Jack Sparrow delivers an amusing and funny charisma to the movie. And the action scenes had me at the edge of the seat. And the music will give you chills down your spine. The new characters make the movie interesting and they are presented in a way that will give you the creeps. But thats what makes the sequel interesting and fun to watch. I will try to make this comment as unspoiling as possible. But from the start to the finish you will be on the edge of your seat because the scenes are action-packed. You will not be disappointed"

","I had not expected Dead Man's Chest to be so good, I did keep myself with low expectations until it was time to see the movie at its premiere and I think that was a smart thing to do. I thought it was so damn funny, even funnier than the first one, though it was also darker than the first one. It was never boring, the fight-scenes was amazing, especially one, you will know which one when you see it. Dead Man's Chest has everything a good sequel is supposed to have, lots of humor, funny villains, a very slimy new Villain, Jack Davenport was very cool as Norrington this time. The movie has so many levels, from action to slapstick a' la Buster Keaton. I guess I don't have to mention that Depp is amazing as always, that's more than you can say about Bloom or Knightley, but they're cute and doesn't bother me very much. Not much more to say than; whatever you do in life, don't miss the Pirate of the Caribbean-movies!!! Easily one of the best movies of the year."
"livvytheolive","9","0","2","3 December 2006"," A masterpiece
","It is an amazing out of this world film ever i did not give it a ten though because i do not think it is the best film in the world but it is amazing for all ages.<br/><br/>Jonhy Depp is an amazing Jack Sparrow in the film and Kiera Knitley and Orlando Bloom are brilliant too. This film is about Davy Jones heart in a chest and the chest's key and Jack is trying to get hold of it while fighting the Kracken and many other creatures and shipmates, as they set sail on another journey for the Dead Mans Chest. Brilliant special effects and storyline, hilarious script and brilliant settings.As Captain Barbosa appears at the end for a particular twist."
"baconballs1969","8","0","2","29 November 2006"," Enjoyable and Fun
","I watched this several nights ago with my wife and we both really enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>I think it is better to the first film in almost every way and from every angle, the acting, production, direction, screenplay, special effects - everything. Having said that I thought the first film was good too.<br/><br/>This film contained a lot of ""monsters"", far more than the first film and to be honest, I was surprised that the film didn't have a higher classification than it does. When I was a kid I would have had nightmares for weeks due to some of these horrific creations but it seems that kids are much more tougher nowadays. The special effects were great, especially the tentacles on Bill Nighy's ""octopus"" character.<br/><br/>If there is one criticism to be made then it would be, for me, that the movie went on a bit too long. I'm not a very big fan of long movies and it has to be something extremely special to hold my interest for more than 100 minutes or so and this film only just managed to keep me watching to the end. I'm glad I did though. It's not that the film was boring, it's just that I find it really tough to sit still for so long and hold my attention.<br/><br/>On this evidence, I strongly hope that there will be a third film.<br/><br/>Great!"

","look at Ghostbusters 2, Princess Diaries 2, and the later episodes of Star Wars. Too much of a good thing can be a bad thing. That was my thought when I Saw the preview. Then I remembered, Its a Pirates of the Caribbean movie! No possible way it could be bad. And I was not let down! They didn't recycle all of the old jokes, but did little references to them. Like the classic ""Why is the rum gone!"" line by Jack has been used again. And of course, Jack still calls Will a eunuch! This movie has even more funny lines like ""I've got a jar of dirt I've got a jar of dirt and guess what's inside it!"" and ""Look *gunshot* an undead monkey! Top that!"". Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly, JAck Davenport, and many other people are still here in all of their glory, featuring new people like Bill Nighy, playing Davy Jones the controller of the seas, and Tom Hollander who plays Lord Cutler Beckett who is the new bad guy on the Royal Navy side of the story. This movie is full of fun, laughs, and action. I highly suggest you buy this movie. And don't forget to see the third when it comes out Spring 2007!"

","The first was a classic, but the second was sooo coool!! Unbelievable acting (esspecially on Johnny d's part) and an adventuress plot with lots of excitement and thrills. And this is coming from a girl who considers the HIlls Have Eyes boring! There were lots of laughs and it managed to kill some peeps without any gore, and without making the main characters seem like terrible people. Elizebeth is a lot more daring, and Jack is a bit different, but in a good way. He found his character more I think. Orlando Bloom has improved, there's action for the tomboys out their, romance for the more feminine, and for those of you who are Obsessed with cute guys, their's plenty of them in their to (no I am NOT talking about Davy Jones). Anyways, what I'm trying to say is... besides the theme song is stuck in my head right now... it was a rockin' awesome movie!! It's definitely worth two hours! So see it! You'll love it!!"

","OK me and my two other friends are really picky about what movies we see as a group, we can never decide. So when we saw Pirates was out we all agreed this was the movie. It proved us right. It was worth my $9.50 totally. This movie was packed with action and adventure. I was so surprised with how good Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom were. The story line kept me on my toes, when I had to go to the bathroom , I ran! It was just that good, almost as good as the special effects. They let Johnny Depp do his own thing this movie.

","UNDEAD MONKEY! Top that!""....Well, Pirates of the Caribbean 2 has a solid go at topping the top-grossing film of 2003.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp, Oscar-nominated for the role of Capt. Jack Sparrow, possible the best-worst pirate ever owing a life debt to Davey Jones, Captain of the Flying Dutchman, another cursed ship. Also returning, Orlando Bloom as Wil Turner, the decent colonialist, who in the spirit of Flynn's CAPTAIN BLOOD, is drawn into the pirate's life along with Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Swann.Wil and Elizabeth are arrested instead of wed and slated to be executed for their part in Sparrow's escape. Wil cuts a deal to bring Jack;s quirky compass in return for a pardon for he and Elizabeth. The three become involved in Sparrow's struggle to free himself of eternal servitude onboard the Flying Dutchman, along with ""Bootstrap"" Bill Turner aka Wil's Dad. Captain Jack and Wil Turner's unlikely friendship continues in one misadventure after another, with more returning character's from the original than you can swash a buckle with, like Elizabeth's father Governor Wetherby Swann (Jonathan Pryce), the lovable buffoons Pintel and Ragetti (Lee Arenberg and MacKenzie Crook), first mate Gibbs (Kevin McNally) and the fallen Commodore James Norrington (Jack Davenport).<br/><br/>Director of the original, Gore Verbinski again throws the pirates into one amusing action sequence after another, from island cannibals, to an inevitable bar fight, some Treasure Island homages, battles with barnacled minions of Davey Jones and a runaway mill-wheel-three-way duel between Jack/Wil/Norrington that is worth the price of admission and beverages.<br/><br/>Depp's swaggering-staggering Sparrow makes any scene fascinating with his rock star take on pirates. But be WARNED: Pirates of the Caribbean 2 and 3 were produced back-to-back to allow for quicker release of two, meaning Dead Man's Chest is ""a link film."" And for those of us who endured the ending wait between The Empire Strikes Back and Jedi, you know what I mean. Pirates 2, ends with a bit of a cliffhanger which is always risky. The ending leaves almost nothing resolved and no villain thwarted.<br/><br/>The locales as breath-taking and effects are as stunning as the original, in particular the ship swallowing Kracken. Sadly the brilliant Bill Nighy as Davey Jones is wasted as the overly CGI and effect laden character, who could have been anyone and was less striking than the previous films nemesis. In fact, I would rather see Nighy play Sparrow's dad (who was supposed to be briefly in the 3 movie due out in 2007)"

","Confected Kiddy-gut vomit with ""nutty"" Depp, overpaid, hyped to his hilt and overindulged, giving the kind of performance that's endearing in the bedroom but has no place with a running camera on face. It's closer in conception to a video game than a piece of bone fide storytelling  numerous maguffins the vapid centre of its aimless forward thrust. It fills its face with busy visuals, contrived gags and pirate clichés, as bland and one dimensional as the ride it's based on. No real story, no depth, no reason to be  its perfect for an audience with no interest in style, character or imagination. A commercial behemoth that will please silly women who think Depp and Bloom are reason enough to see it  their superficial appeal an easy score for wholly minds, and silly boys who like their movies like their x-box titles. At the time of writing the biggest opening box office hit in history  the Godfather to this in just 30 years, no irony, no hope - unquestioned. Hollywood's rape of film culture continues unabated and with the consent of its drooling patrons. Part 3 awaits in May, a big-budget nonse offering your kids the promise of sweets from the jar marked 'entertainment'. Some simple laughs."

","Having read some of the reviews for the film it is obvious that a lot of people have a real problem with this being a sequel with a fairly bizarre and sometimes outrageous plot.<br/><br/>This perplexes me as I would have thought that those people would not have bought tickets for a film based on a Disney ride that has undead and sometimes be-tentacled pirates and the main character based on Keith Richards.<br/><br/>They of course are allowed to waste their money as they see fit but I for one enjoyed every minute of the film and was sorry when it ended. I know that some people have likened it to the empire strikes back or LOTR the two towers, I think that thats is exactly right. I think that sequels are often the best in a line of films as you already know the characters and can get into the film that little bit easier.<br/><br/>In terms of characters I loved Davey Jones especially because Bill Nighy was playing him. I found it all the better because even though he was mostly computer generated you could still tell that it was Bill by the way that his face moved and his eyes. The CGI was fantastic throughout the entire movie but I found that for me that the ""over use"" of CGI does not detract from my movie experience ever. In fact the more CGI that is in a film the more I love it. If I want to see GREAT acting with real people I go to the Theater not the box office release at the cinema.<br/><br/>In terms of plot I did not find it confusing though you did have to do a bit of sideways thinking to discover peoples motives sometimes. Most of them were straightforward. It was quite obvious that Jack had done something to highly annoy Davey Jones at some point in the past and that was why he wanted his soul. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was awesome too, I thought that it was exactly what the movie needed for a quite dark sequel. Also the re-introduction of Barbossa at the end was brilliant he was one of my favourite characters from the first film.<br/><br/>So all in all I loved the film, it was exactly my kind of film; good guys, bad guys (with tentacles) and pirates. What more can a person ask for? 10/10"
"disdressed12","8","0","2","28 October 2006"," less hype,much better movie than the first one
","i must say,i quite enjoyed this movie,i think mostly because my expectations were very low.this is due to the fact that i was disappointed in the first installment,because my expectations were too high.how ironic.this entry had more action,better action sequences and more humour.it was at times also darker than the original and the acting had more depth.there were also more characters and various sub plots,but the movie was still easy to follow.the one thing that irritated me at first was that they made captain Jack Sparrow's character even gayer than the first.Johnny Depp does somehow pull it off,though,give him credit for that.so this was only a temporary annoyance and then the character'quirks,or foibles,if you will,grew on me.i don't perceive being annoyed by this in the next installment.this movie also had some more suspense and the action sequences were at times very intense,in a good way.there was an abundance of cgi in this movie,which was exceptionally well done,the best i have seen in a long time,possibly ever.the filmmakers did a great job of balancing humour suspense,action and some darker material together.the story also had more depth and i cared more for the characters this time around.i think most of the characters were better written,for whatever reason.the only other complaint i have is that the movie was a bit too long.i did however like the ending.nothing fancy,just a low key setup for the third installment.basically,this is a case of the sequel surpassing the original in every way.i can't wait for the third entry,though i have higher hopes and it has a lot to live up to 7.5+*/10"

"general-melchett","8","0","1","18 October 2006"," Not the best this year, but still a hugely impressive film!
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was the THIRD highest grossing film of all time. I have seen the two highest - Lord of the Rings: Return of the King and Titanic, and they are a lot better and more meaningful than this. The humour is just weak in this one - people falling down holes is so old now. The ending is pants, and this film was really only made to satisfy the nippers for the summer. But by gum, it did do that, and made over $1 BILLION in the process. And I can see why - all of the highest-grossing films are big-budget epics. This is no exception. The action sequences are beautifully done and directed, Johnny Depp is once again great in his performances, the film is stunning to look at, and aside the rubbish humour, there is a brain and talent behind the script. Davy Jones is an absolutely brilliantly-made character - both in script and special effects. There is lots of depth and enjoyment in the characters - there is never a boring moment, and it is a very good recreation of the days when pirates were around. This film defines the word ""epic"" in every way - big budget, cast, and effects. With this and other modern classics like ""The Ring"" under his belt, Gore Verbinski looks to be on his way to adding his name to the annals of successful directors.<br/><br/>However, the ending practically gives the third film away - we know just what to expect. The last scene in the voodoo hut should have been completely scrapped - Jack Sparrow finally copped it in this film, but he bowed out in a simple yet very effective and memorable way. Aside the bad humour and ending - this is, in every sense of the word, a film giant, busting film records here and there - it looks to be a smash when released onto DVD. 8/10"

"energyman-speed","8","0","1","4 September 2006"," A highly recommended good movie...
","The first thing you need to do when you watch this movie is recap your knowledge of the first one... otherwise you will be a little confused.<br/><br/>I have read a lot of negative reviews about this movie, but I still watched it any way and I was pleasantly surprised.. I have also read that this movie was a little cliché, but I disagree.. the action towards the end is a cliffhanger! A MUST SEE.. It makes you want to watch the third installment.<br/><br/>The story also is decent, but the only reason I did not give this movie 10 on 10 is because of 2 flaws in the story.. Here they are: 1) Will turner goes hunting for capt Jack Sparrow to save Elizabeth Swann from prison, but 10 mins after he leaves, she is released very easily. So when she could be released so easily, why did will turner have to go hunting for jack sparrow??? 2) How did the Black Pearl suddenly get trapped on the island?? that one totally comes out of the blue!! And co-incidentally, will turner finds capt jack sparrow and the rest of the crew on that deserted island.. A little far fetched if you asked me.<br/><br/>But anyhow, if you are not that choosy about movies, I am sure that you will overlook these and the movie is well worth an eight on ten if not more. You can see that a lot of effort went into making this movie and make no mistake, I will be watching the third installment coming next year! Bottomline... this movie is quite good and one for the entire family. Easily the best movie of 2006 thus far."

","After the wedding of Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan is interrupted and the with the pair facing the gallows for helping a pirate escape Will goes in search of Jack Sparrow to retrieve his mysterious compass to gain a pardon. But when Jack tricks Will onto the Flying Dutchman to pay his debt to Davy Jones it's left to Elizabeth and the disgraced Norrington to help Jack find the heart of the Flying Dutchman's captain. But when the chest is found and opened Jones summons the deadly Kraken to destroy those who oppose him.<br/><br/>The unexpected success of the first movie Curse of the Black Pearl has turned Pirates of the Caribbean and Jack Sparrow into a global franchise that a sequel became inevitable. But where so many sequels have been poor and lack luster in the past Dead Man's Chest breaks with tradition. Director Gore Verbinski once again teams up with Hollywood heavyweight producer Jerry Bruckheimer with the swashbuckling, high action formula remaining the same they've produced a fast paced, exciting film that rivals but never surpasses its predecessor. Orlando Bloom has most of the screen time and holds his own against the completely CGI created villain Davy Jones, and Kiera Knightley's Elizabeth Swan leaves behind the damsel in distress persona of movie one to fight against Jones's crew. But naturally it's Johnny Depp who once again steal the show as the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow, a part he was born to play and a character he has turned into one of the biggest cinema icons of the last few years. This movie is great fun and will once again capture the imagination of cinema goers of all ages. Its stellar cast, great action sequences and CGI effects make it easy to forgive the rehashing of movie one jokes. With the reintroduction of a familiar face the end is perfectly poised for the third instalment expected in May. Jack is well and truly back."

","The sequel to the excellent Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is a fun, enjoyable experience that is worthy of being apart of the trilogy.

But there is a great new villain named Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) ruling the high seas, with a creature they call The Kraken killing anything in its path. Although not as good as the first, the sequel still has that feel of adventure and is only lket down by a disappointing ending that leads straight into the planned end to the great series.

","In fact, I like movies with a good story OR real good action. This one has both. The first one I liked because of it's humor. Especially because of Johnny Depp who is extremely funny in this movie. Dead mans chest is more of the same, but with a better story. It slows down when it needs to and speeds up when it is requested for the sake of the movie. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you like humor like Charly Chaplin (look at Jack Sparrow throughout the movie and you know what I mean) if you like Kiera Knightley (I know I do) and you like action as if you are in a roller-coaster. I didn't mention the special effects:maybe the effects on the Kraken (I will not tell what or who that is) are a little over the top, but nevertheless I have been amused for the full length of about 2 and a half hours. And that does say something about the movie in my case. I am defenitily going to see POTC part three when it comes to cinemas in about one or two years."

","This film is popcorn-cinema at its very best. No other company but Disney is capable of producing such a perfect combination of excitement, fun, romance, and style. Just like the first Pirates of the Caribbean, Dead Man's Chest presents a number of big Hollywood stars who seem to be having the time of their lives. Keira Knightley is beautiful and not only that. She is funny, brave, and decisive for the plot. The crew of the Black Pearl is once again as chaotic as faithful. Orlando Bloom is a hero once again, this time, however, he does not really seem to be that shining light that he was in the first movie. His part is a minor one, and once again, Johnny Depp makes the film both the best non-animation film by Disney and the best pirate-movie ever.

It has strong doses of surreal humour.Some elements of tragedy.Good for kids but not too kids since some pirates are rather frightening. The way the native tribe was portrayed was funny but in an age of supposed globalization it smacked racism since the tribe conformed to the stereotypes of such people that were common currency during the high days of European colonialism.We have moved forward from that age or not?

","First when I watched the trailer I jumped out of my seat and said ""ooooooh my Goood !! "" finally the second part will be out , and I wanted to watch this movie by any means.And here I am finally watched this great movie which takes your mind to an adventurous world full of mysteries , secrets & suspense not neglecting humor(of course). In general, the movie is a big blockbuster & better than the first, who was also like a surprise for the watchers.Some scenes may seem a little bit slow and boring , but this doesn't decrease from the movie's value as it has many and many and many interesting sword-fight scenes and hilarious chases.There is something which can be noticed and may be important in this movie which is the FEMALE characters in the movie. It's obvious that they play a very important role in the events of the movie (this began to appear for me since i watched the movie again).For example: (Elizabeth) she is the one for whom (Will Turner) decides to face a lot of dangers and threats his life for her sake , and she is also the one who , to some extent , was the reason of (Jack's) death. Another character is (Tia Dalma) which has a multi-benefit role and her importance will be more the next movie (after bringing captain Barbossa back).Her importance appears as she is the one who HELPS the ship crew to know the secret of the key , and it seems that she is chess player and they are the pieces !!. The last female character is an unseen one which is the woman who made (Davy Jones) take his heart out for her and so making all characters searching for this heart and so on. So she is one moving the main event in the movie. Those three female characters are an example that women can easily control men's lives and sometimes destroy them , they have great influence on them and they are masterminds .Of course I'm not against women or something but I think that's something the movie is trying to say.At the end I'm telling that anyone who haven't watched the movie yet then he MUST MUST , and if anyone saw the movie and has another comment please inform me.Another thing which is if anyone saw the movie & agrees with this analysis tell me because I'm not sure whether this analysis is right or not !!."

Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, is known for over-the-top movies that defy belief so much it's distracting to the story, but perhaps director Gore Verbinski has toned him down a bit. Pirates is still over-the-top excitement, but it really doesn't distract from the storytelling the team of writers maintain.<br/><br/>This installment of the Pirates trilogy pits the Keith Richards inspired Captain Jack Sparrow, portrayed skillfully by Johnny Depp, against the under-worldly Captain Davy Jones. I'm not sure what went on in developing the final two chapters, but Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann, played by Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley, end up in the adventure somewhat as an aside - Dead Man's Chest is really Jack Sparrow's movie. I could go into the story, but it seems pointless, the story is linear and the characters seem to develop almost forcefully. There are detours in the film that seem to only exist for spectacular adventure and could easily have been cut from the movie, especially when it ends at over 2 and a half hours in length. The cannibal island act didn't do anything for the story except to bring together four characters from the previous film. It seems like they couldn't figure out how to get these people in the story any other way. Honestly, the characters all come from different places and all end up on the same island together just to be chased about by cannibal tribes-people (some of which looked like Irishmen). Some of the characters were introduced in this film seemingly for no reason, but our main characters seem to be quiet fond of them.<br/><br/>Besides some weak elements, as mentioned, everything was amazing. The story drew you into it with compelling drama, suspense and adventure. The action was exciting and big (true to Bruckheimer's pedigree). The vistas were amazing; filmed on location in the Bahamas. The most impressive part of it all was the innovative, cutting-edge CGI effects. It is amazing to see how far computer generated images have come over the years."

","Yes, I'm a late boomer in the pirates legacy. It's been open since Aug 3 and I only got to see it tonight. I think everybody must've seen it, but for those who haven't, go see it before you miss it.<br/><br/>I never liked Johnny Depp the way everybody did. His type.. his looks... he's just not my cup of tea! I mean, yes, he's funny and witty and enchanting and has that charisma not all actors have but... what did I say about not liking him again? Wait, SCRAP that. I love him as Capt. Jack Sparrow! Aye aye, Captain! <br/><br/>The movie, at 153 mins, could've been shorter though. I was sitting through the action packed sequences, and midway through I had to shift butt cheeks (ooh.. i'm getting better at this review thing~!).<br/><br/>Love it when Jack Sparrow got into the satay form, meat between exotic fruits, trying to ""roll"" away from the cannibalistic tribe. Love it when William Tucker (Orlando Bloom) saw Elizabeth (Kiera Knightley) kiss Jack Sparrow. Oh!!! The heartbreak! Love to see Jack Sparrow running funnily across the beach. Sounds cliché, huh, but Depp just has this weird chemistry (and body language) to make the scene plain funny.<br/><br/>OH and the CG!! OMG!!! Those are the best tentacles I've ever seen stuck on a man's face!!! Sheesh! How the heck did they do it?!?!! Did Bill Nighy wore a mask during production and then the tentacles added on in the computer? (If you read the trivia, it's: Yes, he did.) And I love the new Disney logo! Very pretty!! (That's what they get for buying Pixar down)"
"lostfan7","8","0","1","10 August 2006"," Pirates 2 - Dead Man's Chest
","Alright, to start off, I didn't find it as well-done as the first one, but that could be the definite lack of good-feelings and childish humor.<br/><br/>In Pirates 2 the darker side of each of the three main characters is brought forth - Jack, Elizabeth, and Will. Changing of opinion and matters of disloyalty are a main plot function. As in the first film there is quite a bit of changing around concerning ships and ports, and though there is little detail to support these constant changes (which can be confusing at times) they are carried out gracefully and are filmed sequentially and smoothly.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes from the first film are continued on in this one, which I found disappointing in some parts (""I'm still rooting for you, mate!"" yells Jack to Norrington at one point, and at another ""Why is the rum always gone?"") but well carried on in others (as Elizabeth boards Jack's new ship he mutters to a fellow pirate, ""Hide the rum."") As always there is a bit with a dog, a bit with a bird, and a bit with a monkey, and all are done comically with good reasoning.<br/><br/>Another interesting factor in Pirates 2 was the jumpiness. There are several moments in the movie where we find ourselves either tense with suspense or jumping a foot out of our seats as something pops out unexpectedly.<br/><br/>Overall, a good film. It doesn't match up to the first one in that it's a much darker version of piracy, with blacker comedy and some more unexpected (if unwanted) twists. There are some plot lines that are strategic and difficult to follow in places, but if you watch the film again you'll undoubtedly work them out and enjoy it a bit more once over.<br/><br/>8/10 is my bet, considering the first to be a perfect 10."
"ripayne","5","0","2","9 August 2006"," Not the swashbuckling adventure I expected
","Overall: The movie leaves the story-line hanging; not unlike the first LOTR or second Star Wars (Empire Strikes Back). Different facets of the story are spun-up but none are resolved; just as we thought we had another twenty minutes of show time to bring things down the home stretch and find resolution, the credits started rolling.<br/><br/>Positive: Swashbuckling Disney school-age adventure we were expecting. Davy Jones and crew had well done makeup and looked believable. 2.4 hours out of the summer heat! <br/><br/>Negative: Cartoon like quality to story line (whereby we are moved from one location to another without any real transition or explanation). None of the major conflicts are resolved before the movie ends however a whole new adventure crops up in the final seconds.<br/><br/>Overall: Best seen on the big screen but be prepared to have to wait until the final episode comes out to finish what this story starts. 5/10 for make up, costumes, and sound track."
"trueman-1","5","0","3","7 August 2006"," Less Movie, More Disney Roller-Coaster Ride
","Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the ri... movie. From the start the twists, turns and loops of this movie get faster and faster, and higher. Everything about this ride has been souped-up, mega-sized, etc... all in an effort to outdo the first movie. Unfortunately it's not just the action which has been souped-up - the villains and corresponding horror and violence has been as well.<br/><br/>This movie/ride is definitely not for the faint-of-heart. Davy Jones' crew makes Barbossa's Zombies (from the first movie) look like Hobbits next to the Orcs in Two Towers. At times things (especially the scenes with the Kraken) get every bit as intense as scenes from Aliens - while there are humorous moments much of it falls flat due to the serious nature of the movie which leaves you hanging on for dear life at times. A NOTE TO PARENTS: be responsible and get a sitter. This movie is not meant for kids despite the marketing (shame on you Disney and McDonald's). Despite the ratings in most areas (influenced I'm sure by politics) I could not recommend this to anyone under 14.<br/><br/>Because of the wildness of the ride you don't realize you that haven't actually gone anywhere (i.e. no plot development). The only change you note is that you're a little higher up from your starting point preparing for the next big downward spiral. The sharp twist at the end though is one of the most enjoyable moments of the movie - it also is an indication that the second part of the ride may be as wild as the first. We'll have to wait and see. Let's hope they don't jump the tracks entirely in an effort to outdo this one as well."

"aimless-46","7","0","2","6 August 2006"," Some Good Comedy Sequences
","I finally saw this at a theatre this weekend. I love movies but hate theaters. But I was in the middle of three days of eight and under fastpitch softball, it was 95 degrees at the nearly shade-less softball complex, and the small town theater had $4 matinée prices. About midway through I got a headache but that could have been from the 32 ounce slushy rather than the film. Considering this has been out for five weeks there was fairly large crowd in the theater. <br/><br/>Basically it was an entertaining film if not as good as the first one. It was really too long (most of the cannibal scenes should have been cut as the film really dragged at this point). <br/><br/>The assembly of the film was horrible, making the story hard to follow and failing to build up even a tiny bit of suspense. But it works fine as a comedy. <br/><br/>Knightley's character has less screen time than the original and her stuff is more silly than funny. You could say the same for Depp and Bloom as there is more focus on the supporting cast (a good thing in the cases of Davy Jones and the bubbling pair of Black Pearl crewman-a bad thing otherwise). <br/><br/>While certainly better than recent CG mega-movie like ""King Kong"", the unprecedented attendance is hard to understand. These computer generated action sequences are getting very old and losing their effectiveness with seasoned viewers (""20,000 Leagues Under the Sea"" did scarier stuff using rubber tentacles almost 50 years ago) and the CG scenery backgrounds are little better than the old painted backdrops."
"macenblu","4","0","1","1 August 2006"," yuck...and eww...BONK!...and a bit more YUCK!
","first, I must say that the first POTC left me longing for more. i loved Depp's performance: such charm and wit. The action was fun and creative.<br/><br/>This film? i kept waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>all the twists and turns and betrayals (most of which were just not very clever)...so many convenient magical trips to different locales leave you wondering if the whole story happens on one island. What is the time frame? how do the two comic relief guys make it to the island where the pearl is in a dingy? how does Bloom make it to the island where the chest is buried? certainly he couldn't have ridden the flying Dutchman underwater, right? (i think we have to assume that his line about the sea turtles is an allusionary joke to the first movie's line, right?) how is it that bloom comes to be on the same boat that Elizabeth was stowaway upon earlier? certainly the ocean is a bigger place than this, right? is the island with the witch doctor lady the same island where the Dutchman was parked, and the same island where jack was leader of the tribe of cannibals? it must be, or how else can you explain how everyone seems to traverse the sea in a dingy...<br/><br/>another problem: EVERYONE is just so dirty! part of what i liked about depp in the first movie (and in most of the film choices he has made in his career) is that, despite going out of the way to look dirty and grimy, you still cant take your eyes off of him...but in this movie, EVERYONE is just so filthy...Knightley, Bloom, Norrington, witch doctor lady...<br/><br/>and everything that is not covered with dirt/grime/pig leftovers is just really really gross looking. In the the first movie, the skeleton monsters were well-done, especially since we only saw them in the moonlight, which made for some interesting effects possibilities. But everything in this movie seems to stretch the boundaries of yuckiness too far. Whether it is bootstrap bill's disgusting face, all the gross fish monsters, or REALLY gross former humans that have become attached to boats and whose 'brains' stick to the wall when they pull away from it. add to this the bloody scars, slit throats, torture, and mass executions, i believe Disney takes it too far. I am not a squeamish person by nature, but i am sure this movie made a decent number of kids cry.<br/><br/>And all the action and circumstances are just too farcical. Depp is running around like a poor man's buster Keaton, conking his head on trees or falling into pits with provided ""BONG"" sound affects. the pirates are rolling down the hill in a conveniently round cage made of (you guess it, YUCK) recently eaten humans' bones. Or Bloom and norrington are mixing pratfalls and sword fighting skills while maintaining balance on a whole different circular wheel while (you guessed it) rolling down a different hill. Keira Nightley has obviously taken fencing classes since the first movie, cuz now she is a master swords-woman, capable of dual-sword wielding while fending off 4 or 5 disgusting fish monsters...everyone is routinely being stringed upside down by a rope trap or caught in a big net and dangling...<br/><br/>monsters and ghouls...the first movie had an easy excuse, THEY were cursed....this movie is just full of over-reached magic mumbo jumbo...and everyone seems OK with it...not even a moment of shock from Bloom when first confronted with Davey Jones...keira whips into action without a second thought against the monster fish men (wasnt she the one that doesn't believe in ghosts in the first movie?)...big water Krakkan monsters that eat boats alive....enough already...<br/><br/>as far as characters, what i really liked best about POTC1 is that EVERY character in the movie was likable, from Depp to Barbossa to Norington...this movie digs into the bag of stereotypical villains, to bad effect...i would also say Bloom is just too prominent in this one...though good looking, he is not much of an actor....i want to see more depp..i just get tired of the constant pratfalls (which seem even stranger, because when he is not conking his head on a tree like a clumsy fool, he is doing a double somersault over a ravine or some other incredibly agile feat) now trust me, i really enjoy when movies leave questions unanswered for potential sequels...but in my opinion, this movie just leaves too many things up in the air....what was that castle in the beginning where jack gets the picture of the key? how does he come to be in the coffin? i don't believe this movie takes anything away from how much i loved the first one....but i will say this is probably the most disappointed i have been in a sequel i was REALLY looking forward to since matrix reloaded..<br/><br/>my advice...too violent and gross for kids...not witty or believable enough for intelligent adults....very disappointed...that said, i am sure i will see the third one anyways...i just will not have such high hopes....it seems the East India trade company will be the overall bad guy in the end...i just hope they don't turn this into a preachy ""see-how-bad-the-slave-trade-was"" kinda movie....i can watch amistad for that..."
"Shadowlandv1","10","0","1","31 July 2006"," if only i could give it 11 stars...
","first off, i AM a rum-runner (a huge pirates fan), so i may be biased, but i tried watching this movie from a neutral point-of-view. and..it was amazing. i loved it! it takes place right after the first left off, and also incorporates many references to the first film (which you MUST see before seeing this movie). you can see that will turner has become more daring, more like a pirate. another to succumb to pirating is none other than Elizabeth, who will shock everyone who hasn't read spoilers for the ending by heartlessly leaving jack aboard the pearl alone to face the Kraken. but let's not get ahead of things. ;] Keira Knightley did not do as good of a job acting-wise in this movie as she did in the first movie, but the ending and the funny bits she throws in redeem her. Orlando bloom does quite well, and you really start to love him. and, of course, johnny depp. Oscar nomination number two. i can't begin to describe my love for captain jack sparrow, but i'll just say that if you love the drunk staggering, crazy eye movements, and really random (and funny) quotes which now are featured on thousands of IMDb board posts, you'll fall in love all over again.<br/><br/>now onto the supporting characters. first off, governor swann. Jonathan Pryce has a little more character in this movie than in its predecessor, and the few scenes he is in are gems. my favorite black pearl crew member (besides cotton's parrot), Joshamee Gibbs, is hysterical in this movie. ""lift it like it's a lady's skirt!"" had me in stitches. onto Davy Jones. bill nighy: where's your Oscar? his performance was beautiful, and i can't wait to see more of his story in the third movie. Stellan Skarsgard also had a flawlessly beautiful turn as bill turner, will's father. the whipping scene (i won't spoil it) had me near tears. and..pintel and ragetti! they finally show some depth. ""the dichotomy of good and evil"", the pronunciation of ""kraken"", and the whole bible skit are too funny for words. also, Davy's crew (all amazingly done with cgi) are fabulous, as are the rest of the pearl's crew. also, look for naomie Harris who plays Tia dalma. i want to see more of her in the next movie! she's great.<br/><br/>in conclusion, this is the best movie i have seen this year and one of my all-time favorites. it's funny, has a GREAT sword-fighting scene (on a WHEEL!), and proves that not all sequels have to be worse than the first movie."
"Mer_Girl_Fits_Heaven","4","0","1","2 August 2006"," Sadly, Jack, the saving grace of the original, ruins this one by being a morally decrepit ""hero"" you can't cheer for
","The biggest disappointment of the summer, because the hero wasn't a hero. Jack sparrow wasn't remotely lovable in this movie (maybe because he sold the man who saved his life to a fate worse than death, and tried to steal his girlfriend in a way that wasn't remotely humorous, like it was in the first film. Another thing that bothered me was his ""signing up"" hopeful sailors for said fate worse than death under the pretense of joining his crew, which bares an eerie resemblance to the Nazi's telling the Jews they would get showers, when really sending them to the gas chamber. As such, it is dreadfully difficult to cheer for anyone in this movie, and when you thing Jack is dead, you feel like, ""Why is everyone so upset, he was horrible"", and that is certainly not the Jack we fell in love with four years ago. Plous the pacing is bad, and there are some random parts that totally didn't need to be in the movie, like the part on the island with the natives--funny, but did not add anything to the story but half an hour to spend in an uncomfortable chair."
"lord_aquila","7","0","1","2 August 2006"," Disappointing
","I'll probably be lynched for this, but I think it is my duty to report what a great disappointment ""Pirates of the Caribbean-Dead Man's Chest"" is. First of all, the makers have focused way too much on the genre 'comedy'. Jack Sparrow barely said something serious, keeps on running into things and falling into holes. Don't understand me wrong, Johnny Depp is a great actor, he's just been told too much to play the 'strange guy'. I've had some good laughs with the first movie, but I barely smiled at the jokes they made in DMC and there are a lot. I mean, how can anyone take this character Davy Jones seriously? They speak about him so light-hearted and only when the Kraken is mentioned people start to express some fear. He's just not threatening enough, except for the scene when you see him playing organ, with his back facing the audience. But then you see he's actually playing with this tentacles, so the whole moment is ruined. He might as well have started to dance around. The Kraken is very threatening, but we see it three times, so when it finally attacks the Black Pearl, I wasn't 'afraid' anymore. It attacks the Pearl three times, so I was getting sick of the thing already. Back to the jokes. There are some good ones, especially on the island where Jack faces the grill :-). But they use too much jokes from the first movie. The phrase 'You will always remember this day as the day you almost caught captain Jack Sparrow' belongs to the first movie! So does the dog with the keys! The makers seem to try very hard to link this movie to the first one, with all the references but it just doesn't work. Too much has changed. The great house of the governor has been replaced by Beccket's shack, Isla de la Muerte and its cave with tropical beaches and jungles. Too less pirates, too many Caribbean. And the action scenes are good, but the sword fight between Jack, Will and Norrington is totally ridiculed and the one-liners are awful ('With your permission'? What the...'). And except for the wheel there is barely an environment for a great fight. What's so interesting about fighting on a beach? And there are way too much Orlando Bloom fighting scenes and too less Johnny Depp fighting scenes. It feels like Will's the captain of every ship he gets on and Jack's a stupid coward. In the first movie you had the final fight with Barbossa, but NO ONE HAS FOUGHT DAVY JONES IN THIS MOVIE!!! Or you can look at the poker game as a 'fight'. Maybe there's a big fight with Davy Jones and Jack/Barbossa/Will/Sao Feng/Norrington/Beckket in the third movie and there better be one. But couldn't Will and Jones have a fight over the key? No he just steals it. Wow, Will, you're some pirate.<br/><br/>Now some random things that annoyed me:<br/><br/>-Pintel and Ragetti: Why? Why do they have to escape and make me want to vomit because of their lousy jokes. And why does Ragetti have to explain the triangle-fight again? We got it, alright? The audience is not stupid, you know. -The Dead Man's Chest: It is buried in sand for Christ's sake! I expected it to be in some cave with some traps and stuff. I know this isn't Indiana Jones, but it belongs to the 'adventure'-genre! -The story: The story is pretty lame and it is not told in a good way. The only thing we get are some facts. -Davy Jones' crew: They look scarier than Barbossa's crew, but they are far more stupid. When Jack knocks one's head off with a coconut, we see him running around like a fool, so who in God's name can be 'afraid' of him??? They are icky when you firs see them, but they're just idiots. -Davy Jones' voice: Not threatening enough. -'Bootstrap' Bill: What a lame character. Was he a pirates once? He looks like a sissy to me. He's so life-sick and depressed and doesn't have any of the vitality the other crew members have. He's just a sack of potatoes, waiting till his years of service are over. He helps his son, but not with some epic stuff. Will, you don't have to save him! The characters: The character Jack Sparrow is totally ridiculed, except for his final moment of bravery and death. Will Turner's saves the day and Elisabeth is just some woman who doesn't know what she wants. Norrington is the same ambitious man as in the first movie and Beccket is barely a replacement for him. Davy Jones is not scary and the governor is a retard. But Tia Delma's a very good new character, Barbossa saves the end of the movie and Briggs is the best!<br/><br/>But I also liked things in this movie: The first island-scene, Depp's and Knightly's acting (Orlando, you don't have to shout your lines, you can just say them!), the terrific music, the bar-fight and some jokes.<br/><br/>This is the greatest disappointment of this year so far. It is of course a movie for the masses and the makers seem to have focused way too much on big benefit and not on the masterpiece The Curse Of The Black Pearl was.<br/><br/>All my hopes are on the third one..."
"cmsrin2","4","0","2","29 July 2006"," A Middle Movie In my opinion
","I saw this movie a couple of weeks ago and was unimpressed. I thought the first Pirates movie was fun and a good movie to spend a few hours watching. This movie (the 2nd movie in a trilogy) tries to capitalize on the success of the first. The movie is fast moving and full of outrageous hijinks. However, in my opinion this movie is not as good as the first one for several reasons. First, the movie begins with a scene which shows birds plucking out the eyes of pirates. I believe it is inappropriate to show this type of shot in a movie that is catered to young children. While I know this movie is labeled PG-13, the fact is that this movie is directed at children from the age to 8-18 and on. From personal experience I know that this shot negatively impacted the children I saw the movie with, after seeing this unnecessarily violent scene they starting crying etc. Second, the movie has lost the magic of the first, the movie speeds along born aloft by unnecessary violence and huge plot holes. Third, the character of Elizabeth Swann takes a drastic turn for the worst in this film. Rather than the independent, strong willed heroine of the first movie, she is now a shrewish witch who runs around throwing her hands up and screaming at Jack and Will.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie and was looking forward to seeing it. However, after about twenty minutes I was ready to walk out.<br/><br/>I want to say that the third movie will be better and this second film only suffers from Middle Movie syndrome. However, after watching this film I have to admit I fear that the third movie will be even worse and the Pirates trilogy is another creation born of greed and lust for merchandise sales."
"abitahooey","7","0","5","29 July 2006"," an entertaining mess
","This movie, while being fun, had no real plot. It runs about half an hour too long, and my impression at the end was that I was owed not just one cliffhanger ending, but five. Gore Verbinski, Disney, and Jerry Bruckheimer all owe me five endings. Not like 'things are done, but this is what happened next,' actual endings. The movie simply stops at what is apparently the middle of the story. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun film to see. Johnny Depp is amazing, as always, as he saunters around half-drunk, half-homosexual. Kiera Knightly also puts in an impressive performance, having much more to do in this film than in the first, where she mostly just looked scared or pouty. In the end however, it's just not as smart and fresh as the original was."
"Stampfldaniel","7","0","7","29 July 2006"," As usual, very good film, but not as good as the first one!""
","I've seen this film, on the first day it runs in the cinemas. Obviously it is one of these films, which is a worthy sequel of the first PoC! Although it doesn't have the charm of the first film, it is a superb film. The film is exciting and the jokes are felicitous. Although the film is very long (150 minutes), you are never bored of it. The only thing, which is a little thing bothering is the ending. This review is NO SPOILER. I don't tell you the end, but it is open. And the open and is so open, like the ending of a season you see in series. So you MUST see the third PoC, and I think if you want to see the third part of PoC, you MUST see the second part. But no worry, when the third part plays in the cinemas you have definitely the chance to see a triple feature in the cinemas like the matrix or lord of the rings features. :-) What are the odds! But all in all the (half) film is a very good film, i think you don't regret it, if you go in the cinema to watch it. And Johnny Depp and the rest of the crew is excellent. Also the special effects are superb. And if you haven't seen the first PoC, shame on you. Now go to your video store, rent a the first PoC and in the evening go in the cinema to look the second part. And then wait one year and pray that the third part is as good as the others and much more important pray it has an end."

","I saw the movie last weekend and thought is was pretty well done. I came in the theater prepared for an average movie, and this movie exceeded my expectations. All the fight scenes were good and funny due to Cpt. Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley were like the first one, very good supporting characters. BUT it defiantly wasn't as good as the first one. This is one of those movies that some people think is the best in the world, while others think it pointless.

"Actor317","9","0","1","21 July 2006"," Great Movie
","I went to see Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest the day it came out and was disappointed. I was expecting better since the first movie blew me away. I felt however that part of the reason I did not like it at that time was that I didn't fully understand it, I was expecting something completely different, and when the movie ended it was 1:30 AM. So I decided to see it again and had a completely different reaction. This film wasn't as good as the first but not many sequels are. POTC 2 had amazing effects, funny dialog, and an overall entertaining story. The only flaws were that there was less interaction between the main characters than there was in the first film. Also, while Davey Jones was an interesting 'villian' Barbossa was a lot more entertaining. All in all the movie was great. I think it would have a more positive reaction from other viewers if it didn't have the other one before it to compete with. If you aren't to impressed the first time you see it, i recommend giving it another shot. I would have given the first POTC a 6 out of 5 stars but i'd give this one a 4.5 out of 5 which if you think about it, is still really good."
"wrhatch","8","0","1","21 July 2006"," good but not as good as the first
","While agree with all the comments from above, on characters and CGI, etc. I think the writers did not do as quite as well this go around. I liked many of the references to the Legend of the Black Pearl (LBP), but I got tired of that by the end of the flick. Sure it was funny to have the Governor try to find the keys to the jail cell and mutter something like 'Where is that dog?' but that kind of thing just got a little too overdone by the end.<br/><br/>I get that the director/producer probably wanted to make a movie that could stand alone more than the Harry Potter series, which relies heavily on the viewers understanding the characters and plot of previous installments. But at the same time, it seems that make too much effort to reference those kinds of details from the LBP, so that if the viewer has not seen the LBP they will not understand the refs.<br/><br/>That's really my only gripe.<br/><br/>I loved the action scenes and new twists on sword fight scenes. In general, a sword fight is a sword fight and hasn't changed since before the black and white era. It was a great movie and I recommend seeing it to anyone. The acting was very well done. There was no gap or inconsistencies from character to character from the first. Those supporting characters returning from the LBP carried their characters over perfectly."
"gizmo_griffin","7","0","1","20 July 2006"," Over All Pretty Good
","I thought that this film could have been made better, but it isn't really that bad. I absolutely adored the first movie, and was somewhat disappointed with this one. Johnny Depp was superb in this, as usual. Davey Jones is disgustingly incredible. One thing that I think was the main reason I was displeased was because they didn't make the scenes blend nicely, they kind of jumped around a bit. A friend of mine phrased it nicely ""By the end of the movie, I felt like I was on a very long ride that I wanted to get off of soon."" I agree with that statement. Some of the scenes were those that were better suited for a video game than a live action film. They were very unrealistic. The costuming and make-up of the film, though, were some of the best I have seen in years. Davey Jones and his crew looked as though they have just spent the last 50 years on the bottom of the ocean, became mutated, and crawled back on land. Very nice. Captain Norrington was also spectacularly costumed. Johnny's make up was perfectly suited for his character. Over all, the film was pretty good."
"whizkids","7","0","2","20 July 2006"," The Dead Man's Chest is still second to the Black Pearl.
","First, let me say that I really, really wanted to like this movie to the fullest. I felt that the first movie was over-hyped, but good. This one is also good, but over-hyped beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>Will and Elizabeth are finally facing the consequences for their actions at the end of the first film. The punishment? Death. There is a chance that one of them can receive a pardon (it's never made clear which one exactly would actually get it) if Will brings to the new leader of the East India Trading Company, Lord Beckett, the compass that belongs to Captain Jack Sparrow.<br/><br/>Jack meanwhile, is trying to find the key to the Dead Man's Chest when he gets an unexpected (and rather creepy) visit from Bootstrap Bill Turner, Will's father. He informs Jack that the deal he made with Davey Jones thirteen years ago to raise the Black Pearl from the depths of the ocean and make him captain of it has reached its limit. His soul now belongs to Davey Jones, or else he must suffer the wrath of the Krakken. He rushes toward land, any land. Which happens to be Cannibal Island. There's a bit of a ruckus, but in the end Will has found Jack, Jack takes him to Tia Dalma (a voodoo priestess) who informs them of the importance of the Dead Man's Chest and where they can find the key to unlock it, revealing an item that might just save Jack's soul. There's much more to the plot, but it would take too long to give even a brief description of it. Long story short, Will gets the key from Davey Jones, and gets to meet his father. Norrington has had his life destroyed due to Jack Sparrow, and Elizabeth is torn inside trying to decide between Jack and Will. All this while everyone is trying to get the Dead Man's Chest and the treasure within.<br/><br/>This can get very confusing. The plot is a mish-mash that could have been split into another two movies. The action is what carries the weight here, and it does get very exciting (and half the time it's also very humorous). Jokes from the first film are used again, but it seems more in line of continuity then lack of originality.<br/><br/>The big problems with this one include some slow pacing (we really didn't need the whole Cannibal Island sequence), some rather violent images (sometimes this felt like a sailor's horror movie), and the general darker tone to this compared to the first film. It's just not quite as fun.<br/><br/>If you're a good ol' rumrunner that is looking for adventure on the high seas fighting against the paranormal of the briny deep aided by astonishing visual effects and can follow many, many plot lines woven (loosely) into one that feels like it relies on two big names and tremendous action sequences to be a success, then this is a movie for you. If, however, you prefer a story that focuses more on characters, is easier to follow and has a more upbeat tone to it, I recommend you sail for different waters. Savvy?"

","I enjoyed the first movie greatly, thought it was an 8 out of 10. I went into this sequel with very high expectations, maybe that is why I was so disappointed with it.<br/><br/>The positives about this film are undeniably the brilliant creature effects and....well that's about it.<br/><br/>First of all it is just plain boring! Granted there are a few brilliantly staged action sequences, especially the water wheel. But other than that it was a LOT of dialogue.<br/><br/>Next I thought that Johnny Depp was just plain unlikable in this sequel. His plans are evil and dishonorable. At least in the first one the main character Jack Sparrow was someone you could root for.<br/><br/>Also Jack Sparrow was hysterical in the first film, in this one his lines just don't come across as funny. They were obviously written for laughs but my wife and I sat there looking at each other in stunned disbelief, not funny at all! When Jack is funny is when the lines and humor are less forced, in fact the funniest parts for me were when Jack was not talking at all but rather doing some sort of physical comedy.<br/><br/>Finally this movie is about an hour too long, they could have easily accomplished the same thing in about 90 minutes. Then again they really didn't accomplish anything at all as the end leaves you wondering what you just sat there 2 1/2 hours for and answers very little of your questions."

","Having loved the 1st Pirates film, it was in anticipation that I went into the dark theater to watch the sequel. I was confused almost the minute the film began. The plot of this film rushes by in a whirl of action and excitement. The scenes and stunts are spectacular, aided by the incredible performance of most of the actors. I was greatly impressed, but a lot of things in the story just didn't make sense to me. To give the filmmakers a little mercy, there was a huge storm the day I saw this film and the power went out twice. Add to that a few minutes absent from the theater, and I really shouldn't complain about constantly feeling I had ""missed something"". But I just got the impression that the filmmakers did not make everything as clear as they could have. I have no doubt that many of my questions will find answers come the release of the 3rd film. As an after note, I was rather annoyed by the character of Elizabeth Swan. She had a very abrasive personality. Whether this is a fault of Keira Knightly's performance, or an intentional addition by the filmmakers remains to be seen. But I don't remember her being that obnoxious in the 1st film."

Looked less like a pirate this time - teeth too perfect, face less gaunt - too healthy altogether! Orlando was less 'Legolas' this time - growing in his role as Will Turner. To comment on Keira Knightly - what is she up to? Not acting anyway. There's a scene on a beach which should have been cut - when she had a temper tantrum - irritating to watch. I've seen her in King Arthur and of course Pirates 1 and thought she did a good job. I have only seen the film once yet so maybe I'm a bit early with my comments. Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd makes an appearance - though not exactly a pretty one. Always good to watch great actors."

It seems that 'Dead Man's Chest' and the third film are really just one movie but cut in half. I'm not sure that I like the direction they took with the Elizabeth Swann character, but Capt. Jack's direction is right on. Will Turner as bordering on a secondary character. The CG work was exceptional, but overdone with the final scene with the Kraken's teeth. Most people will not be disappointed with this film. Remember to stay thru the credits as they have include a scene after the credit, remember the dog being chased as the ship set sail?"

"Evil_Magus","6","0","2","16 July 2006"," Not Disappointing: A Wonderful Action-Comedy and Sequel.
","It is rare nowadays to find a sequel that is actually decent, even rarer to find one that's actually good. Fortunately, Pirates of the Caribbean has spawned off this sequel that's a fitting follow-up to it's 2003 counter-part.<br/><br/>The acting is much the same as it was in the first film. Johnny Depp still plays the quirky captain just as well as before, although it must be said that his performance might suffer somewhat from the audience growing more accustomed to his comedic antics. Orlando Bloom still plays the temperamental and sometimes impulsive William Turner, Jonathon Pryce still plays the comedic supporting character of Governor Swann and Lee Arenberg and David Bailie still play the comedic duo of Pintel and Cotton (although their parts suffer slightly from a little less substance than the original). The only performance that I think has actually improved from the original is Kiera Knightley's, which I attribute mostly to a larger and more noticeable role than before.<br/><br/>Bill Nighy comes aboard (pun intended) as the legendary Davey Jones. His performance is excellent, as the crustaceaous and stern villain. His performance has some quality to it that's quite indescribable... something just askew enough to stand out but not so much as to stand out too much. It's not a not quite stiff, not quite nasally air about him... an understated performance in an overstated role... Whatever it is, it plays itself marvelously.<br/><br/>The score is not nearly as impressive as the original. Before it was fresh, it was exciting, it was imaginative... In this movie it too much resembles the original, to the point where I ended up thinking ""I've heard this song before (although there was once where I found it pleasingly varied from the first movie). Upon reading the credits it didn't surprise me at all that Klaus Badelt was not brought back as the composer. His original flavor in the music is gone, much like John William's flavor is gone from the later Harry Potter movies when a new composer was brought in. I'm actually a fan of Hans Zimmer's work, but not here. He showed himself off far better in Batman Begins, Gladiator, The DaVinci Code, The Lion King and around one dozen other movies that he's been a part of. His job here was sub-par.<br/><br/>The movie fell into a rut, especially in the beginning, of constantly self referencing itself. At times it was almost painfully obvious, from Johnny Depp becoming the chief of the island cannibals (from the first movie, ""...And then they made me their chief""), from the woman in Tortuga sending Jack a slap across the face (admittedly not hitting Jack, though) to the constant jokes about the rum. There were a number of tie-ins from the first movie that were, at times, annoying, although not nearly as bad as the first category. This includes the roles of Cotton and Pintel, Barbossa and Bootstrap Bill. This, however, cleared up (mostly), after about the first half of the movie.<br/><br/>This movie falls into the category of action-comedies, unlike the predecessor, which was a comedic action movie. The differences are clear throughout the film, where comedic gags take center stage over the choreographed fighting. The gags that I refer to (especially on the island with the three way fight between Norington, Jack and Will) take center-stage over the action. Some of the fights could have been as memorable as were the ones in the first movie, but not enough time was spent to develop them to do that. As it is, the fights are only semi-memorable, and even then only near their ends.<br/><br/>The special effects were just as impressive as the first movie, only in a different way. In the first movie they bordered on subtle, almost indiscreet. In this movie they're loud and obvious. This isn't a complaint or a criticism, but a fact. The special effects are purposefully made more obvious and evident than they were before. Davey Jones and his crew are remarkably well rendered.<br/><br/>The film, though, runs a tad longer than it should. Several scenes might have been better taken out altogether. One case of this is where Will and his father play Davey Jones in a game of dice. In the end, Bootstrap is still on Jones' service, Will is still on the ship, and Jones is still the villain. We knew already that the key was on Jones, and it wouldn't have taken to figure out where that was. This scene added virtually nothing to the movie. The fight-scene on the island where the chest was buried ran a little too long, and could have benefited from a few minor cuts in the action. The scene where Elizabeth and Jack debate each other's moral character could, likewise, have been deleted. It foreshadows what's to come, yes, but weakens the result. Jack's decision to return could have been made more selfless and developing if he hadn't been guilted into it by Elizabeth's scolding. With those two scenes deleted, and that third scene trimmed slightly, the length of the movie would have been much improved. Also, the movie has no conclusion, it simply ends. Even then, it only does so in the technical sense of the word; there's a point where the film stops running and the credits role. However, nothing it left resolved, and the ending is a terrible cliffhanger.<br/><br/>In the end, this is an extremely enjoyable movie, and a sequel that can stand on its own merits as a well made action comedy. While at times too self-referencing, too long and overly comedic, this is without a doubt one of the more enjoyable experiences to be found in theaters this year. It is highly recommended for families, although it must be said that this movie is too intense for young children. Fans of the first movie should be generally pleased with the second."
"sausagesandmilk","3","0","2","16 July 2006"," Feelings for Jack?
","So I have a question. Does Elizabeth have feelings for Jack Sparrow or no? I mean there is the compass incident and she seemed really sad when he ""died"". But then she was the one who said ""I'm not sorry"". Not sorry she ""killed"" him or not sorry she kissed him? I read a previous comment stating that when Elizabeth held the compass and it pointed to jack that was not because she liked/wanted him but because he was in some form the way to save will.It seemed like she did have feelings for him though. But i cant decide.The movie was excellent though i did not enjoy as much the 1st time as i did the second. However a person who had never seen the first movie would not have caught many of the jokes so definitely see the first first."

","This review is from the perspective of weekend number two. Here's the bag of chips : PotC : DMC took in a record $130-something million dollars for its 3-day opening, billed as the ultimate 'summer' film, and nothing but good, action entertainment. Yet, in the haze, not all opinions are of perfection. So to say, more than thought possible are actually con-Caribbean. I went into the theater with an open mind, especially since I can enjoy a good film that isn't aimed at a guy named Oscar.<br/><br/>When the Disney fireworks hit, and the DEAD MAN'S CHEST text fades over dark, murky waters, my mind becomes at ease. When Bloom and Knightley make their first appearance, it is just as expected. The straight men, for the eccentricity to follow. As so it did, at the expense of a woodpecker. The film waves hello. Hi film.<br/><br/>Here is where things get complicated. It has all the elements of an entertaining film. It pushes off the massive success of its original. It also carries its attributes, as well. Long dialogue sequences may prove pointless. The actors do a good enough job, that if the film were silent, we could pick up on their motives. Early on, that appears to be the case. What is the payoff for it in the first third? It doesn't have to do with anything. Just your admission ticket at work, to see Jack in action again. Thoughts rise from this. Could the film possibly be a little full of itself? <br/><br/>Now, no complaints about the special effects, for dang sure. Two major sequences with a 'large' conflict, and the villain himself, Davy Jones, showoff just what the future holds for film. All stops were pulled to make 'Pirates 2' looks as gorgeous as possible.<br/><br/>Besides that, even with it being a Disney film, and Johnny Depp matching his 'Curse' performance equally, the film somehow lacks personality. Ending at the 2 hour and 45 minute mark, with long dialogue sequences, even lengthier action scenes, and a plot that seems like one big set up, things tend to get dull. By the time money scenes arrive, some people may have traveled off into Neverland. Or sleepy land.<br/><br/>But everything is there, in full form. A good prefix to describe Dead Man's Chest, would be 'Over'. Over-hyped. Overdone. Overzealous. But the series is sure not over. Which was, if anything, the point of this second film."

And little did he knew is that he's schedule to be a victim of the Flying Dutchman, Davy Jones. And there's no turning back on this one cause the Flying Dutchman can track him down anywhere at sea.<br/><br/>Jack must find a way to get himself out of this with the help of Will Turner and Elizabeth. As well as unexpected characters involved in the same mess.<br/><br/>I liked this movie a lot. It has element you won't see from the original. And it's action pack so there's never a dull moment. That and the ending is what you would call a cliffhanger. Which makes this one like ""Empire Strikes Back"" where you'll have to see the next one to see how it ends.<br/><br/>The next one ""At the World's End"" is in production.

","All the while I was watching ""Dead Man's Chest,"" I had the funny feeling I had seen this movie before.<br/><br/>We're introduced to new villains, new motives, and a new storyline that don't quite work as well as the tightly written, snappy original, but we still enjoy it because it features the characters we've come to know and love. Furthermore, because the third portion of the trilogy was filmed simultaneously, there's an odd feeling of sadness and discord in that the film is merely only a bridge to the third, a whetting of the appetite if you will until the final resolution.<br/><br/>In other words, it's ""Back To The Future, Part II"" all over again.<br/><br/>Not that that's an entirely bad thing. Johnny Depp is pure eye candy on the screen; no matter how ridiculous the plot, how implausible the situation, he holds our attention, and rightly so, because he IS Captain Jack Sparrow, and he's so wonderful at it. Keira and Orlando are in fine form too, with both quite possibly looking even more lovely than they did in the first film. And, oh, are they all having fun up there.<br/><br/>So when you see it in the theater, and everyone should see this on the big screen, just keep in mind that BTTFPT was the weakest of the bunch.

Same as Luke Skywalker because by the end of the first movie he was on his way to becoming a Jedi.<br/><br/>Jack Sparrow is the pirate and kind of the lady's man.

Not too many people know about it.)<br/><br/>I was really surprised and pleased at the return of Governor Swann, Norrington and Gibbs, and at the relative largeness of their roles. I had thought that these smaller characters from the first movie would be phased out to make more room for Jack, Will and Elizabeth, but they actually contributed to the story and were welcome returners.

What raises the grade from an average (5-6) is the marvelous performance of Johnny Depp and the improved (not yet perfected thought) performance of the other lead actors. Also the very nice, and progressively enhanced CGI helps the grade. This film contains more humor, which in my book never is a bad ingredient if done in a proper way, as here is.<br/><br/>What lowers the grade is the safe-play, as mentioned. And I just can't give to much credit to a producer with dollar-signs in each eye (he himself a modern pirate, but less entertaining and more self-denying).<br/><br/>So all in all, a mediocre film, with some shining details and fewer flaws then it's previous installment."
"raysond","Null","0","1","13 July 2006"," Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest
","It would seemed like of ludricious to eventually think that Disney would have made a sequel to one of the biggest hits of 2003...the monster hit ""Pirates Of The Caribbean:Curse Of The Black Pearl"". The first installment was a runaway hit and huge box office success giving Johnny Depp an Oscar nomination for his impressive work as Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow. Well,it's three years later and all of the original cast that were in the first installment are definely back again in the second installment of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest"". Again,director Gore Verbinski returns along with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and supporting cast Keira Knightley and, Orlando Bloom for another round of high adventure and breathtaking excitement. Unfortunably,in the wake of the first film's huge success,this is almost sinks deep into the abyss of film failure,but in all this one is most cartoonish than the original film from 2003 which was very difficult to achieve. The second installment of ""Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest"",often feels like a live-action version of Road Runner-Wile E. Coyote extravaganza and on the other hand feels like a live-action version of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd with a hint of Daffy Duck thrown in for grand measure. These moments are the funniest-liveiest parts here while the rest of the material is just bloated and as for the rest of the material it is brilliant in the special effects area along with some excellent scenes involving the bad guys-a creepy,crawly crew of half-humans,half-crustaceans,not to mention a showdown with a enormous multi-tentacled leviathan-a monstrous squid that really is sort of a tribute to the earlier Disney films,especially Richard Fleischer's 1954 version of Jules Verne's ""20,000 Leagues Under The Sea"".<br/><br/>The first one was absolutely brilliant,but the sequel to this one is kind of a disappointment especially with some of the performances here. Johnny Depp's performance as Captain Jack Sparrow is watered down in parts but the rest of it is okay if not concern with some of the scarier scenes and cliffhanging action sequences which may confuse younger audiences. Be aware that the film has a rating of ""PG-13"". In the second movie,because of Jack's blood debt to the feared pirate Davey Jones,Elizabeth Swann(Keira Knightley),and Will Turner(Orlando Bloom)must join the quirky captain once more and defeat a series of supernatural villains who want Jack's soul. However,if Captain Jack finds the treasure chest to Davey Jones' locker,and if he can control Jones,then Sparrow can avoid being his eternal slave. If not,he'll will be doom to life in eternal damnation and servitude in the afterlife. Anyway,the characters travel to exotic islands,dirty pirate hangouts,and come face to face with other characters that are more frightening than those in the first movie. However,the performances are okay,but still letting Depp take control of the lead,the movie pays more attention to Knightley than in the first film,especially in the action sequences where she hold her own. As for Bloom and Depp the characters are more in focus are more entertaining here. The rest of it was spectacular,especially with the computer-generated action and astounding special effects. However,there is a chase scene that drags on endlessly and that was tiring at times. The movie is way too long. At over 150 minutes at length it gets boring with some of the material with some of it as no-stop action in between. <br/><br/>But in perspective,""Pirates Of The Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest"",which by the way ends in a cliffhanger to set up for the next and final installment of the series,which hits theatres around Memorial Day of 2007. But still nothing can stop this film for becoming one of the biggest hits of the summer. And again,we can thank Johnny Depp for that."

","Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest is not as Action packed then Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl. The first delivered a lot more pirate based action and it had less talking. But this one had long talking scenes and not enough action to entertain me enough. And Davy Jones is not evil enough to bet Captain Barbossa. And the acting of Captain Jack Sparrow was not as funny as the first films Captain Jack Sparrow. But overall This film was a great film. Sea Monsters, An evil Governor, A scary pirate ship, But very short battle with the ships witch disappointed me. Because in the first the ship battles were long and entertaining. If you miss this movie you will regret it."
"TJ1380","8","0","2","13 July 2006"," A good, fun summer movie
","I admit that when I first heard that there was going to be a movie based on Pirates of the Caribbean, I was skeptical. I just couldn't figure out why everyone was getting so excited over a pirate movie based on a theme park ride. My attitude changed when I finally saw the movie. Not only did it deliver one of the most memorable film characters I've seen in a long time in Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow, it turned out to be the kind of fun adventure movie I used to watch when I was a kid. Despite all the state-of-the-art special effects it was the kind of swash-buckling pirate movie that they just don't make anymore. Needless to say I was much more excited about the sequel, and while I didn't enjoy it quite as much as the original, it's still the kind of fun adventure movie that should be released in the summer season.<br/><br/>The movie picks up shortly after the end of the first one. Jack Sparrow is the captain of the Black Pearl, and Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann (the other, less memorable heroes from the first film) are arrested for aiding in his escape from the hangman's noose. They face a death sentence, but the charges against them and Jack will be dropped if Will manages to find Jack and bring his apparently magical compass back to a cruel and manipulative government official. Meanwhile, Jack has his own plans: it turns out that he owes his soul to Davy Jones, the devil of the sea himself. He may need his compass to locate Jones's treasure chest (the ""Dead Man's Chest"" of the title), the contents of which may be the key to freeing himself from his debt. I really can't say much more than that without giving too much away, but let's just say that soon everyone has their own plans for the chest, and they'll stop at nothing to get it.<br/><br/>The plot does get rather convoluted at times, which is the main reason why I liked the first ""Pirates"" better, it still works for two main reasons. First of all, it never really takes itself seriously enough to interfere with the spirit of the film. It definitely takes things into darker territory than the first film, and it allows for some good character development, but the film never forgets that it's supposed to be fun above everything else (the film even makes a joke about momentarily stopping the action to explain the story so far). Secondly, it allows the character to act exactly how pirates are supposed to act. Jack Sparrow may be capable of acting the hero, but as a pirate he can also be an untrustworthy, thieving, backstabber who would betray his own friends to save his own skin. Remarkably, this doesn't make him any less likable; his behavior as well as the behavior of others is treated as simply the way pirates are supposed to act. They're only loyal as long as it serves their purpose, and some backstabbing is all but expected in their world. This kind of moral ambiguity fits the theme of the film perfectly, and I for one am glad the filmmakers recognized this.<br/><br/>As with most sequels, there's not much I can say about the acting that hasn't been said in the first movie. Once again, Johnny Depp steals the show as Captain Jack Sparrow. As I said before, he's more morally ambiguous this time around, but it works incredibly well for his character. He also seems to engage in a bit more slapstick, which I'm not a fan of unless it's pulled off really well. Fortunately, Depp pulls it all off incredibly well. Just as before, his Jack Sparrow is something of a bumbling fool, but the fact that he always manages to escape any situation due to luck or a sudden feat of swashbuckling heroism (or both) makes him into a legend in his own mind. The other leads are good enough, but this is definitely Jack Sparrow's movie.<br/><br/>The film also provides a great villain in Davy Jones. In addition to being a great CGI creation (his squid-face often looks more like a very lifelike mask), he has considerably more depth than one would expect from a summer movie villain. He's a ruthless, fearsome, and as frightening as a good villain should be, but one expects that he was not always this way. There's a sadness to his character that suggests that he many not be as evil as he first appears to be. I definitely want to see what happens with his character in part three.<br/><br/>The action scenes have about the same feeling as the first film with one exception: the first film didn't have a Kraken. It seems that just about every other movie has some kind of CGI monster in it somewhere, and they're rarely that impressive to me anymore, but the Kraken (basically a giant squid capable of dragging an entire ship under water within minutes) somehow succeeds where other monsters fail. Maybe it's because we don't really see much of the beast aside from a number of tentacles smashing apart ships, or perhaps it's the feeling of impending doom as it's attacking the heroes in the climactic battle scene, but the Kraken manages to be as scary and impressive as a good sea monster should be. As for the Kraken-free action sequences, the best would have to be an inventive (and funny) three-way sword fight in which the combatants end up on top of a runaway water mill wheel.<br/><br/>As I said before, while I didn't think ""Dead Man's Chest"" was as enjoyable as the first movie, there's still a lot to love here. It does require some knowledge of the first film to truly enjoy it, but that's the case with most sequels. This one is definitely worth checking out."

","I put 8 because the setting is great and the actors .. actresses are brilliant... the story is good.. it really indicates Piracy but I just can't accept that even the heart is being pirated... Why does Ms. Swan have to fall for Capt. Sparrow... does it really have to be a heart breaking movie? It breaks my heart when Ms. Swan Kissed , Capt. Sparrow. I like the way they portray the role, the settings, it's fun, but I wonder what will happen to Will Turner. Even if they are Pirates it should still show Loyalty with it comes to the matters of the heart. Now I wonder about the Part 3, it seems that only Will Turner who doesn't have the heart of a Pirate but I like his character he is wild and can be savaged but he has a heart that shows he is a human.. that no matter what bloods runs in you, people can still choose their own lives and what they can stand what they believe in and I like his character because he has a heart...."

","This is my first review on a Movie and I am exited to do it for the first time! I am happy to say that Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead man's chest, was an amazing movie. This movie is a great 'middle' to the trilogy. The movie constantly keeps you saying 'what the hell is going to happen next?' The ending gives you a great cliffhanger that makes you want to see the 3rd one RIGHT NOW.<br/><br/>The special effects are one of a kind in PoC 2. Seeing the cracking for the first time is terrifying, even in the back row of the theater. I found the sword fights a little sparse, but amazing when they occur.<br/><br/>There was more suspense, and less humour this time around. Johnny Depp still proves that he is the only actor that can play Captain Jack Sparrow. Orlando bloom and Keira Knightly do their role very well also.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a suspenseful action ride filled will humour and amazing visuals. This movie feels a little incomplete, but the 3rd one shall answer all of our questions.<br/><br/>I saw this movie with my Grandmother of all people. She was asking questions all the movie because she never saw the first one. She did not like it, and came out saying things like 'Why did that guy have snakes coming out of his face'? 'Why did those 2 idiot pirates try to take the ship at the beginning'? She thought that the writer had one hell of an imagination. She said no thanks to seeing the 3rd one with me. All a matter of opinion I suppose.<br/><br/>~Cyano"

","For starters, movie was great in overall. Somehow the ending reminded me a bit of matrix II. How can they put an end to a movie when it's in the middle of something? Hopefully this saga ends better than Matrix...<br/><br/>Any idea how the Captain Barbossa is still alive and survived the bullet in the chest in the first movie? How was the Barbossa's monkey still undead even though the curse was released in the first part? Nice effects, great acting (especially from Mr. Depp again) and stunning plot although it was cut viciously in between...<br/><br/>As a con I would say the movie was a bit too long. The start was great, and it got better at the end, but it some how was a bit boring in the middle at some point.<br/><br/>Verdict. 8/10. Slight dropping from the first movie.<br/><br/>-jm"

","Captain Jack is back with William Turner and Elizabeth Swan in tow, while the East India Trading Company has warrants out for their (and former Commodore James Norrington) arrests. Its double crosses and secret pacts abound on ye olde Black Pearl.<br/><br/>The entire cast returns from the first film as the nuptials of Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Swan (Keira Knightley) are interrupted by their arrest for the aiding of Cpt. Jack Sparrow's (Johnny Depp) escape from custody at the end of the first film. Turner is then offered a deal. If he can get Sparrow's famed compass which does not work and bring it to the conniving Cpt. Bellamy (Alex Norton) than both he and Swan will go free. He agrees and goes on a hunt for the elusive Sparrow. Sparrow meanwhile has had an unfortunate run in with famed pirate Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), to whom Sparrow owes his soul, and if he doesn't make good on their deal of 100 souls for Jones' half human/half sea-creature crew, then Sparrow will be forced into servitude. And as a bonus subplot, Turner is reunited with his long lost dad, Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan Skarsgard).<br/><br/>I must preface the rest of the review with the fact that I did like it, and it was a good film. I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>It was a different film though. But in neither a good nor bad way. It's a hard to describe sort of thing. The first film was a very tight film, with everything working together, and it was pretty character driven, with the action element. But director Gore Verbinski seemed to take it into a different direction with the second (and subsequent third) installment of the franchise. It was infinitely more action oriented, and since it is a companion piece it would be hard to fully appreciate or enjoy without third, which we have to wait just under 11 months to see (fyi, it's been titled Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End). Verbinski does set up the end to lead into the third one, with the shocking departure of one character, and the even more shocking return of another.<br/><br/>And to Verbinski's credit, it is still a well crafted film. It's got the swashbuckling grandeur that made the first one so enjoyable. It's a true delight to see, because even with the human/shark hybrids wandering around the deck, you can't really see any CGI, which itself is marvel in this day and age.<br/><br/>The performances of all involved were top notch. I could speak volumes on Depp as Sparrow or the chemistry between Bloom and Swan. But the two who really show cased their talent in this film were Nighy and Jack Davenport. Nighy was acting through both prosthetics and a computer generated beard of tentacles. But he was able to keep his very expressive face and every so often you could see a hint of Nighy peaking through the make up. And Davenport as the now-broken Commodore Norrington who has since been discharged from the Royal Navy and now travels about searching for Jack to get some of his former life back in order. We first see him on the pirate haven island of Tortuga. Davenport plays a pitch perfect moody and broken man, with inklings of Sparrow inside himself, which is why I believe he detests Sparrow so much. Norrington is starting to become a version of Sparrow.<br/><br/>The biggest annoyance I had with this film was the recycling of old jokes. A few at the beginning were just fine, I chuckled. But some just got beat to death. About halfway in I was sitting there thinking, ""Alright, I get it, the goddamn rum is gone!"" That removed me from the picture.<br/><br/>I can't down vote a film just because of a minor annoyance like the repetition of jokes. Certainly not one which was an otherwise enjoyable experience, and was by no stretch of the imagination bad. But I have to take into consideration that they made it a companion piece with the conclusion a year away, instead of a stand alone film."

","I missed the double meaning of Jack's remark when he landed straddling the cannon. my husband said ""Ouch, that hurt"" I'm wondering, why did Captain Jack move like a ""swishbuckler""? It was very pronounced throughout the movie, and several people in the audience tittered. This same audience should have left their small children home, as some of them cried during the more violent scenes. I was disappointed with the ending, as the same woman whom he had rescued earlier handcuffed him to the chain, leaving him to go down with the ship. However, there's hope, as I hear there's another ""Pirates' movie coming along, and they surely wouldn't do it without Johnny Depp, would they? I missed the first movie, but my nephew has promised to lend me his DVD, so I can catch up on some of the characters.

When I came into the movie, I was excited because I thought it would be better than the first, but as most sequels are...it wasn't. I was disappointed. In a nutshell, I think that some people may find this movie as a ""setup"" for pirates of the caribbean 3, because nothing actually ended (there was no real resolution for a LOT of things that happened). Still, it was entertaining and if you liked the first one, you will enjoy this one, though maybe not as much.

","Before I post my mild criticism, know that I am not a huge Pirates of the Caribbean fan. I saw the first movie, enjoyed it and then saw this. If you are an avid fan of Pirates, this is probably a sequel that will satisfy your craving. From someone who is just a regular viewer it was at least a fun movie to see once in the theater if never again. The only thing that really sort of wore me out was the constant unrealistic action that rivaled that of the Die Hard movies. For me at least it seemed like they tossed in sword fight here and there whenever they felt filling up time was necessary. That, and the 2 hours and 40 minutes of that particular content made me a bit restless in my seat. However if you are an advocate of Pirates of the Caribbean or you are a family looking to have a night out or movie viewing, this movie may be perfect."

","I was entertained. Special effects and the overall creativeness of the movie were incredible. The only problem I have with it was Johnny Depp. Before every woman in America wants to kill me, hear me out. Depp was okay, but not like he was in the first. My opinion is that Johnny Depp is already bored of Capt. Jack Sparrow. Johnny Depp is the KING of weird characters, and Jack Sparrow was at the top of the list. But Johnny Depp is not an actor made for sequels. Sparrow is nothing new to him and it is not a challenge anymore to him. The first one was great because he was experimenting, this one was good too... but he was safe. I hope that in the 3rd movie he takes more risks. Still, a must see and a very good movie overall."

It's actually very different than the first film. One problem about the film is that it's just too long. Although it's long, I still enjoyed it by many funny and action scenes. Johnny Depp is the perfect role for Jack Sparrow. The acting is great. The visual effects are great, at first rate.<br/><br/>Now another problem of the film is that the film drags along. Some of the action scenes are too long. Although many didn't like the ending, because there is no ending, I liked it. We know they'll continue on for the third film so just get use to cliffhangers. There are good and funny jokes in the movie, many of them involving Johnny Depp. Davy Jones (Bill Nighy) make up is amazing.<br/><br/>Kracken, the infamous cool-looking sea monster, also drags the film. The scenes with it just takes too long. This is a huge step from the first film.

","Pirates. What is it about these savages that makes us crave for more? One word: Glamour. No, not in the tradition sense... I certainly wouldn't mind seeing Capt'n Jack walking the red carpet, though. But the glamorous ideals of piracy - cruising through the Caribbean, drinking until you see stars, GOLD! - never fails to 'reel' us in. However, perhaps it is something more than just the material goods that makes viewers tick. Ah yes, a swashbuckling storyline that proves the whole sequels-suck deal to be completely null and void. At least in this case. Oh, and of course Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, of Star Wars. But that was a given.<br/><br/>First we have the dreary wedding day of the soon-to-be Mr. and Mrs. William and Elizabeth Turner. Unfortunately, instead of wedding bells, we see wedding tea cups, swollen with rain. Not my idea of a 'great start to a new life together', you know. Then, we are shoved into the terribly repulsive Cutler Beckett, who blackmails poor Will Turner into retrieving Jack Sparrow's trusty compass - you know, the one that creates a whole new level of distress for our heroes when Elizabeth and Jack make out and Will witnesses it while trying to save various crew members! Oh, and Captain Sparrow has to pay off some debt to the notorious Davy Jones.. Yup, I'd say things are looking grim for our favorite buccaneers. Good Lord, what a mess.<br/><br/>I have to say, I was pretty sure our good friend Gore Verbinski wouldn't let us down by presenting a flop. No, there really wasn't any fear in that. However, knowing what high stakes I had set for the movie, I was surprised at how good the acting was, and even better - the CGI! I was a little disappointed in Curse with the CGI, but thanks to enhanced computer effects, we were now able to make - not only a crew of total barbarians - but a mythological giant octopus AKA the Kraken as well. Johnny Depp has once again burst tensions by being the 'Han Solo' of the gang (for more than one reason); Keira Knightley dropping her 'damsel in distress' character for a more rough-skinned, two-sword carrying young woman, and the wonderful Orlando Bloom, whose acting ability doubled since 2003. But I know that I would mature if I found my long lost father on some God-forsaken wreck-of a ship in the Caribbean.<br/><br/>So, all in all, Pirates II: Dead Man's Chest left us hanging onto to the edge of our seats from the point when Jack shoots himself out of a coffin already inhabited by a corpse, to that rather surprising entry by none other than... well, I'll let you find out by yourself!"
"BenjaminFoxDickerson","7","0","1","10 July 2006"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","The second film in a series is in a tough spot seeing how the plot must progress but not close unless the series is episodic (i.e. Nightmare on Elm Street, Star Trek). However, POC's intention is to make three films the last two of which had to be connected to complete the adventure and resolve the characters. So, they're big challenge is to provide enough story and interest to not only entertain people with the second film, but carry their interest over into a third film.<br/><br/>A point of potential story hazard is that POC 2 opens with some time passed between the first film and this gap has to be filled. Unless it is a film such as LOTR: Two Towers, which picks up exactly where the Fellowship left off. So, re-establish the characters and progress the story without being clumsy or losing people's attention within that period of lost time that exists outside the frame of the film. POC 2 does this effectively. The opening of the film not only establishes all the major characters and new ones, but it introduces a sustaining conflict that connects the sequel to the first film. Sure, the connection is a bit sparse and maybe not as strong as one could hope, but is nonetheless strong enough to push into the adventure. It's the consistency of this initial conflict that provides insight into the new character's motivations later. Although, the character in question becomes slightly too movie villain-ish and doesn't show any higher purpose other than greed. I often find this to be a constant in sequel villains, with the exception of Empire Strikes Back and Spider-Man 2. Villains are often given fewer dimensions than their predecessors which only hurt the viewer's involvement with the major struggle between the protagonist and antagonist. A good villain not only has reason, but also possesses moral and ethical attributes that lend sympathy to the character and make the actions of a villain not justified, but understood. POC 2 lacks this character. The opposition in the film is constantly doing wrong without an indication as to the reasons why from any human perspective. For example, the villain in Serenity does wrong to build a better world and has a strong sense of purpose in what he is doing and why it all has to be done. In Titus Andronicus, Queen Tamora swears to avenge the death of her son by General Titus's hand in the opening of the play. It is in that moment the audience is shown a relentless and pious Titus perform a cruel ritual to appease his Gods; in contrast to a rational and compassionate Tamora pleading for logic and apathy to prevail and her sons life to be spared. Throughout the play the characters trade place before arriving at neutral place, where both do not see humanity, but vengeance alone. Now, with that said I am not comparing Titus to Pirates of the Caribbean, but am suggesting that if we have something to learn from Shakespeare it is the dire need for a layered antagonist that views themselves as just in spite of everything around them. This is what POC 2 lacks, a villain with a true arch that shows the audience a duality they can diffuse in themselves. This shortcoming doesn't make the movie less enjoyable from a shallow entertaining, novelty aspect. It simply displaces the depth of the story in combination with the adventure. The villains are still grandiose, larger than life and nasty. They just lack the sympathy of even Captain Barbossa from the first film.<br/><br/>The next pitfall in sequels is characters and their arch. Is a character starting from one point and shifting enough for the audience to see the difference. POC 2 indeed does this successfully and even embellishes a few hero moments for the core characters. All with the exception of the Elizabeth character which has grown from the pretty trollop of the first film that was merely a place marker for male lust to be projected; into a peer and fighting colleague of the boys, but at points, is still the trollop. The objection I have with the Elizabeth character is that she doesn't evolve consistently from the start of the movie. She actually regresses to the spoiled Governor's daughter that was introduced in the first film, just in a different gaze. Aside from some inevitable character embellishment Johnny Depp is poignant and engaging as Captain Jack Sparrow. Bloom is predictable and sympathetic, hits the few comedic moments he has quite well. Stellan Skarsgård is watch able under any amount of makeup. Jack Davenport (Norrington) is just as good, but his character isn't fully fleshed out, especially since the character was left on a sympathetic note at the end of the first film. I am not sure I understood the logic of his arch, but was watchable and earned more screen time in this film.<br/><br/>All in all the film was really quite entertaining and fun despite its few embellished character and cliché moments. The climax of this film actually left me quite curious about the next film. If not for just the movie, then for some more of Depp's brilliant characterizations of his rock star Pirate. Plus the action scenes were really engaging and well thought out and only added more to the story rather than hindering it. This is even rarer these days. In a storm of trilogies and movie serials POC might hold to be one of the better ones."

","My comment on the film is about the monkey. Sorry if I'm going to spoil it for those who have not watched it but it's the monkey which bothers me. I'm sure that the first time I saw the monkey, it was the skeleton version from the first film. It raced down off the ships rigging and grabbed something. Surely that cannot be, if all the cursed gold had been returned, it would have reverted to being a normal, mortal animal. Jack Sparrow shot the animal in the hut of the witch (?) to prove that it was a good transaction for her help and said something like - ""There, an un-shot monkey."" or something like that. This would mean that the animal was still immortal. Later on, the two pirates on the beach mentioned ""When we were immortal..."" Was this done deliberately by the film people to confuse us or did the rules of the cursed gold not include the monkey? Hope someone proves me wrong or right as the case may be!"

","Long lines and hours of waiting is what many had to endure to see Dead Man's Chest. Let me tell you, the long lines and hours of waiting is well worth the wait.<br/><br/>Those who are skeptical, do not be. DMC is perhaps one of the best sequels to a movie out there...and sequel, schemquel. From Jack Sparrow's popping out of a coffin on the open ocean to him being swallowed up by the Kracken, I thoroughly enjoyed Depp's performance. He took his character from the first movie and made him even more in depth...truly, you can see the many facets of ol' Jack.<br/><br/>Bloom's performance in the movie was a yawn...if you need a bathroom break, go to the bathroom during any of his scenes, except for the whole Jack-Norrington-Will fight. That was a riot. Knightley, in her turn as Elizabeth, showed she was a lot like Jack, and that she wasn't afraid to fight, point gun's in people's faces, and, oh...chain Jack to his beloved Pearl, to be left at the mercy of the Kracken.<br/><br/>The movie villain in DMC is Davy Jones, voiced by Bill Nighy. He did love a woman once, and is now a ruthless pirate, looking for hopeless souls to rope into his service. There are not many fight scenes with him and Jack Sparrow, so don't expect that. Probably they are saving such for the third installment, At World's End. At the end, when they make ready to sail to world's end to save Jack, in comes Barbossa, alive and well. This development will leave you completely anxious for At World's End, to find out how he is alive, and to put to rest all the questions and theories surrounding his reappearance.<br/><br/>All in all, a very enjoyable middle movie.

The first film had a lot of humor that was built right in and flowed naturally w/ the script. don't get me wrong this one has plenty of that as well, but there are some points where they try to incorporate the humor a little too much and it seems out of place 3. I'm sorry, but there is no place in a pirates movie for a bullet time fly-by. the effect has been way over done since the matrix and doesn't fit w/ a pirates of the Caribbean movie.<br/><br/>4. there is a point in the movie where a certain someone plays a dice game w/ Davey jones w/ the terms of eternal servitude. the rules aren't explained very well and afterward your left wondering what just happened and why<br/><br/>5. Though i didn't mind the length of the movie, the whole scene w/ jack on the island as a god about to be sacrificed had nothing to do w/ the plot and seemed extremely unnecessary, it could have at least been shortened if not taken out<br/><br/>those are just a few, and besides those i didn't have a problem with this film. all in all i gave it a 6 because the plot wasn't quite as interesting as before, and a few minor things that added upthroughout the film"

","Prepare to immerse yourself into the pirating world of nonstop action in the second movie of what is at least a trilogy, 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest'. This movie picks up where the first left off, so if you haven't seen the first movie (Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl), it is something you should do before seeing the second. If you have seen the first movie, you're most likely going to see the second- it is only a matter of when. <br/><br/>Fan's of the first film will not be disappointed. Almost all of the original characters from 'The Black Pearl' are back in 'Dead Man's Chest' some making the most surprising appearances at the most unexpected of times.<br/><br/>'Dead Man's Chest' leaves the audience hanging and wanting for more- it has no ending- but isn't that the point of the second movie in a trilogy? I know that I will be waiting in line the very first day the third film is released next year."

","If you are a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean. You will love part 2. In most trilogies the second and third movie always seem to ruin the movie or seem not to be better than the ORIGINAL. Although this movie has broken that tradition. It's an excellent movie with excellent character development, many plots and subplots and it ties in nicely with the first movie.<br/><br/>If you want to watch this movie I would strongly recommend that you watch the first Movie.. Other wise you may get a little bit lost. This movie flowed well with lots of actions although you had to do a lot of guess work because unlike the first movie where stories were told and you knew what was going on this movie failed to encapsulate the story telling which was a great feature in the first Pirates movie.<br/><br/>The great thing about this movie was it wasn't ruled by visual effect. The story line was magical and the flow of the story was great. This movie is a long one but there are no boring bits. There was only one bit of the movie which I didn't like and that was When Kira Knightly tried to be dramatic.. but apart from that it was great...<br/><br/>Also make sure you watch carefully because the writers have left little clues in the movie for the third installment which is HIGH on my must watch movies list...... The second movie has set the scene for the third movie which will be brilliant...."

","Well where to start, where to start. This movie was absolutely spectacular. I really was not expecting it to be this good. Johnny, Orlando and Keira and the whole crew once again worked fabulously to bring us this amazing sequel. For starters I would like to point out that Keira Knightly's performance has improved dramatically since the first Pirates and it is definitely noticeable in this movie. Johnny Depp did as wonderful as always, and Orland Bloom was just as heart stealing as he always his. Bill Nighy was so believable as Davy Jones. Four hours of make up a day and a unique talent certainly helped bring it out too. I was very happy to see most of the old members return in the sequel. And I was very happy when Captain Barbosa returned at the very end; although I am curious as to how he came back. He was one of my favorite characters in the first movie and I cannot wait to have him continue. I was also glad to see so many loose ends in this movie. I am eagerly awaiting Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End I believe it will be as good as the first two."

","and as you can tell by the latest box office readings, it proved to be correct. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has brought in a whopping 132 million over this weekend alone, while leaving Superman in the dust, which earned a measley 21 million, pretty low if you ask me for it being in its second week of release only. Why they put Superman to go head to head with the POTC is beyond me. They should've known the man of steel would stand no chance against all them damn bloody pirates!! Now onto the movie, all I have to say is WOW!!! This was an awesome fantastic sequel that really lived up to the first. And I might as well go on to say it might have even surpassed the first. Everything was outstanding. The acting, directing, special effects, visuals, EVERYTHING!!!! All true Pirates of the Caribbean fans will not be disappointed! Johnny Depp is defintley of course the stand out in the film as Jack Sparrow. The entire theatre was cracking up mostly the whole time. Dang, now I really know he was born to play this role. I couldn't see anyone else playing it but him. The other returning players also gave outstanding performances. Orlando Bloom was given way more screen time this time around then in the first and deftinley shows his talent that hes a fine actor. And Keira Knightley again shined playing the lovely stubborn Elizabeth Swann.<br/><br/>And I have one thing to say to all the people who are bashing this sequel and saying it wasn't good at all because it just has a lot of action scenes and special effects and that there is no plot. So what??? The last time I checked, most people go to the movies to get away from the real world, so to speak. They don't want to be bored by a bunch of scenes where it's just talking and thats it. We want to see fighting, lots of action and special effects. Hey, if you don't, this is your wrong movie. Go see Gone with the Wind or some other sappy drama. I'll take this over any of those anyday!! And hey, if you didn't notice there was a plot, I'm wondering if your watching the same movie I am.<br/><br/>All in all, this is defintley the Big Summer flick of 2006. No doubt about that!! HIGHLY Recommended to everyone who loves a good awesome action oriented special effects extravaganza!!!! This will be a real treat for you. And yes, TAKE THE KIDS!!!!! There are some scenes that are frightening and scary, but not enough to make them cry. The showing I went to had numerous children in it, and all of them enjoyed the movie. I didn't hear one cry or peep out of them except of course laughter. So do take them. The entire family will enjoy this!!! A MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!! 5 stars in my book!!!!!!!"

","I will try not to tell too much of the story. Suffice it to say, I am pleased that the IMDb community--""regular theater-goers"" loved the movie. I will agree that the expectation of enjoyment made it a little hard to get into the movie. It was also scarier than I expected--there were parts I couldn't watch. The critics who write for the big papers just had to find something negative to say. They didn't like the plot. I guess they didn't get it. I did. I thought the plot was good. They didn't like Orlando Bloom--They said his acting was stiff. I thought he was pitch perfect--He is the heroic one--the good man. That's his character, that's what he played. They thought the two lovers were not well written. I disagree. The story followed their relationship as it grew and changed. While Will Turner is a noble person, Elizabeth and Jack are more complicated. Keira Knightly is always a pleasure to watch. Her character has some surprises too. Johnny Depp was, in a word, wonderful. Is Captain Jack good or bad? Is he noble or base? Just when you think you know him, he turns the story upside down. I think he's a good man. If I had to sum up the movie in a word it would be, FUN!. It was fun to watch, fun to anticipate the lines and the facial expressions, fun to be in a packed theater where the audience was rapt with attention. I enjoyed myself thoroughly and I will see this movie again."

","Any film student or member of the industry will tell you that a great film relies on 5 things: A great story/writing, great acting, great directing, great editing, and great cinematography. A lot of ""greats"" I know, but I truly feel this movie captures all of those elements at their best.<br/><br/>The performances were astounding. Funny, dramatic, realistic. Naomie Harris is an astounding surprise, perfectly capturing her accent and releasing it to the audience in a magical way not foreign to the wonderful character she portrays. Mr. Depp is again, enchanting. It seems all the returning actors have perfectly grown into their characters and the new editions are great compliments. This movie is one of the best examples of great character acting in modern times.<br/><br/>There were moments where I was completely wonderstruck by certain camera angels and movements. In a time where most everything has been done in the film industry, that's saying something, not just for the cinematography but for the directing and editing as well.<br/><br/>This movie will undoubtedly be one which movie critics will scorn. It seems that modern day critics should spend more time saving the money they earn from their undeserving jobs, to spend on an education towards the industry they work in, an less time sitting in the theatre guzzling down gallons of soda. If you saw, and like millions of movie goers LIKED the first Pirates movie then you will like this one. There are plenty of nods at the first film (and at the ride for that matter) that will delight anyone with a memory. My main point of advice would be to go see it and form your own opinion."

","OK, this was a good movie. Granted, there was not a lot that I could totally understand about Davey Jones and the reason he was part fish etc. Still, the movie was fun. I liked the first one a little bit more. The end of this movie was a huge shocker. I can't spoil it, let me just say ARRRGG!! Also, the highlights of this movie were all those gross fish pirates. That was very weird. Whoever thought of this movie must have taken a TON of LSD because that was just a bit trippy. Also, I could not understand why and how Jack arrived at the island for the Natives and was thought to be a GOD. That was just weird. However, the effects were good. So, would I suggest this? Yes, I would. The fishpeople were disgusting and freaky. They didn't scare me too bad. That sasquatch of the sea was amazing, the CRACKEN or whatever it was.

This is every bit as sharp and funny as the first, with amazing dialogue and creature effects that had me shaking with delight.<br/><br/>This movie actively rewards the fans who memorized every last line and plot twist of the first. In fact, I highly recommend watching Black Pearl a day or two before seeing this flick. Pay attention to the rum and the sword! Dead Man's Chest has one gaping flaw: It doesn't stand on its own. This isn't one movie, really, but rather the first half of a movie. A sequel, even the inside second of a trilogy, should have its own beginning, middle and end and this one really doesn't. I only hope that all the marvelous questions raised will be answered in the third film."

","Popping onto Rotten Tomatoes, you'll find PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MAN'S CHEST at a 54%, awarded with a green splat icon, and given an across the board ""walk the plank"" by most, if not all, of the American (and British) film critic heavyweights in print and entertainment news.<br/><br/>But here's the rub: a critic exists to create a film's legacy and, with great respect, is a sort of historian for a film. That said, not every film is made to change the film world, but critics have the unfortunate responsibility of applying their valid criterion to whatever they get assigned that week.<br/><br/>""PIRATES 2"" is not a great masterpiece, but it's not meant to be. It's fun, it's exciting, and it's anchored by a decent script and Johnny Depp in top form as Captain Jack Sparrow. The plot gets complicated from the outset, but here's all you need to know: Jack Sparrow made a deal with Davey Jones, promising his soul in return. Time to pay his debt. Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan look to get married, but are delayed, detained, and Will bargains his and Elizabeth's freedom to set out to find Jack. Jack, Will, and Elizabeth find themselves reluctantly reunited in a quest to defeat Davey Jones, win Jack his soul back, and see Will and Elizabeth united in matrimony. That all said, if you know anything about the world of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN, you know that nothing ever happens that easily and we are left by the end with a prelude to next summer's PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: END OF THE WORLD.<br/><br/>""PIRATES 2"" does not offer the same charm of it's predecessor, but it is a different beast altogether. Many critics have descried its script as lackluster, but this time around, we don't have time for details - if you want an introduction, watch the first film. ""PIRATES 2"" has its own story to tell and, at almost two and a half hours, we don't have time for John Williams orchestrated scrolling text or a fifteen minute highlight of the first Battle of Mordor.<br/><br/>All other things aside, this ride is enjoyable and worth the ten bucks to see on the big screen. Don't expect Al Gore or Garrison Keillor, but rest assured of no Brett Ratner or Sandra Bullock. See ""Cap'n Jack"" run, screaming like a little girl, from a hoard of cannibals and enjoy one of the most intriguingly choreographed sword fights since the days of Errol Flynn. And lastly, ""hide the rum"" - there's still the big finish next summer."
"MoneyMagnet","8","0","2","9 July 2006"," Rollicking fun, a decent sequel (very mild spoiler)
","I was very apprehensive about doing a sequel to PIRATES because, in my opinion, they pretty much used up every pirate trope in the book in the first movie, which is why it was so entertaining. So I figured all they could do was a simple retread in a sequel.<br/><br/>I'm pleased that I was wrong. Basically the filmmakers have generated a very entertaining sequel, which is basically another long but amusing exercise in characters gallivanting to and fro, jumping from ship to ship, being separated, being reunited, stabbing each other in the back, stealing things from each other, lying to each other, etc etc. Oh, and the special effects are great. In short, not Oscar material but it seems to me the filmmakers definitely understood what people liked about the first film (mostly).<br/><br/>This is a formula movie. The filmmakers obviously understand their formula. And guess what? It's fun and inconsequential and I wished it could have been 3 hours long. If you hated the first PIRATES you definitely won't like this; if you thought the second PIRATES movie had to somehow be less frenetic and ""deeper,"" you will be disappointed too. However, if you loved the swashbuckling-for-swashbuckling's sake in the first movie and the silly, fast-moving plots about treasures, medallions, keys, ghost ships and what not, you'll like this a lot.<br/><br/>The not-so-good: We've already met Captain Jack so there are no real surprises about him this time and he's not quite as outrageous. Davy Jones is not quite as good a villain as Captain Barbosa (and nowhere near as compelling, since he's hidden beneath some very good CGI). The British soldiers aren't very interesting this time (I think the pair we saw in the first movie became sailors) and the British villain isn't very compelling.<br/><br/>The good: Almost all the characters have returned, and some of the bad characters (like the pirate pair including the one with the false eyeball) are pondering joining the good side, while some of the good characters (like Commander Norrington) take a turn for the dark side. (Commander Norrington, by the way, was supposed to be an outright bad guy in the first film but they made him more sympathetic.) I suspect some of these characters will once again cross the good guy-bad guy line before the trilogy is done.<br/><br/>By the way, Jack Davenport (Norrington) is BEYOND HOT in this one and makes Orlando Bloom look like a mere boy. Just sayin'.<br/><br/>I will not give away the very ending of the movie (which is also a continuation) except to say that people in my theater cheered at a certain familiar face. (And no, it's not Keith Richards) IN CONCLUSION: The bad reviews for this are going off the deep end... these people were obviously expecting WAR AND PEACE, not the rollicking inconsequentiality they did so well in the first film and also do well in this one."

","This was almost as good as the first - just not quite. But excellent anyway. A very delightful romp that has Jack continuing to talk his yarn to save his hide. It was great to see Miss Swann get in the action and swing a blade, not be the total damsel in distress. I would have loved to see more skin - Jack figuratively losses his shirt all the time why can't it be literally?? Great silly fun - like being at Disneyland. A great cast of creatures - many returning favorites- Mr. Gibbs, Governor Swann and those lovely Tortuga gals. We went opening night 14 of us, 12 in pirate costume, and had a great group outing. All showing that night were sold-out by 5:00pm! I didn't meet a disappointed soul or person. And whats with that compass?"
"The_Triad","7","0","1","9 July 2006"," One very Impressive Spectacle
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was a very big film. It was huge. So, the usual is done with Hollywood sequels here, more of the same, but bigger. And I felt it, it was quite a heavy first part of the film, lots of information and detail before the ball really gets rolling and the whole thing starts to flow. The plot changes all the time so would be frivolous to try to explain a plot that encompasses the whole film. Needless to say, Jack Sparrow, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swan all get dragged into another adventure and meet friends and enemies, old and new along the way. The film is big, it's long, it's crammed with characters, some of which suffer due to the amount of screen time they get due to there being so many. But the film's appeal is in it's sheer spectacle, the sets and costumes and special effects are all of an absolutely incredible standard. This surely is the reason the big screen was made, and too see in there enhances the film to a great jaw dropping sight at times. Perhaps the only thing that the film didn't have going was a feeling for the characters, with so many of the new ones given screen time it was hard to feel when the main three got into perilous situations, or maybe that was just me. Pirates of the Caribbean 2 was an enjoyable, likable film, that demands a big screen viewing, but the main stars are the art and effects departments."
"MarshmallowMoo","8","0","1","9 July 2006"," Confusing, but very good altogether.
","The first time I saw this movie, I was slightly disappointed. This is because I could barely understand what people were saying through the movie because of their overly thick accents. The second reason is because I probably had a bad seat in the movie theater at 12:01am. Anyways, this being the case, I went back and saw the movie a second time, hoping it would clear up some things for me. Let me tell you, it sure did! <br/><br/>For people who haven't seen this movie before, the beginning can get a little yawn-worthy. However, I assure you, pay close attention to the details and you will be pleasantly amazed! The acting is excellent (excluding 2 people, whose names I dare not mention because of their wretched acting) and the escalation of suspenses keeps you at the edge of your seat for most of the movie. The CGI was beautiful and so were the special effects. The movie includes several plot-twists that are simply delicious and add to the character development and the plot. Oh, and we can't forget that TWISTED cliffhanger ending that stunned the world! <br/><br/>The only negative things I have to say about the movie is that it doesn't flow as well as the first one. Some bits are a little choppy and can make a first-time viewer leave the theater dazed and confused. Plus, the plot isn't as well thought through as Curse of the Black Pearl, but we must keep in mind that it IS the middle movie.<br/><br/>Middle movies are almost ALWAYS rough, mainly because the producers have to lay out the new storyline for the audience. Take the Empire Strikes Back, for example. The story was a little rough, but the added: ""Luke, I am your father!"" at the end totally made the movie worthwhile. Same goes with this movie: If you hadn't have watched this movie and skipped the the third one, you'd be utterly lost. This is why this movie is not only entertaining, but important to the series.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie was VERY good, but basically a set-up for Pirates 3. I can already tell from watching this movie that the last installment of the pirate tale will be one of the best movies ever made. And I mean that, too..."

The action sequences were so silly, you just want to see the film again to confirm you really did see what you thought. The special effects were special because you stopped thinking about them being effects. Normally I'll try to work out what is live action and what is CGI, but I was too busy enjoying the film to think about it.

All of the characters were perfectly in sync (especially the main 3 - Orlando Bloom, Keira Knightley, and the best actor in the world, Johnny Depp).

","Why all the hate? Almost every reviewer has been getting on this film and giving it bad reviews; Entertainment Weekly gave it a D. And their reasons are that it is too long and confusing. But I say, when pirates, swordfights, and Captain Jack Sparrow are involved, the film could never be to long. I also thought that no film could beat ""Superman Returns"" as the best film of the summer, but a certain jolly roger has just passed the man-of-steel and is leaving him in the wake of their churning water. ""Pirates 2"" has made the first ""Pirates"" film seem mediocre; it is darker, funnier, and more fun. It reminds one of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, when people said ""Empire Strikes Back"" couldn't improve on the first ""Star Wars"", but they ended up being dead wrong. It ended up being the best. Maybe that will happen with the second ""Pirates"", but who knows, the third film may blow the other two right out of the water. No pun intended. <br/><br/>The plot line is somewhat complex, so I'll save myself and you the trouble and I'll just tell you to go and find out for yourself. I will say this, the plot involves Davy Jones, a few daring rescues, and the best sword fight I've ever seen. This alone should draw droves of people, and don't forget our slightly strange, but lovable friend, Jack Sparrow. Who once again is brilliantly played by the amazing Johnny Depp. Bill Nighy as Davy Jones is incredibly freaky, and, second to none, the most believable CG character ever to grace the silver screen. I applaud thee FX masters. I must caution parents though. As I said before, this film is much darker, and much more violent and disturbing; the evil crew of the Flying Dutchman as gruesome to behold. So ye be warned, this is not your typical Disney film. Something else I liked is that all the characters from the first ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" are back, and I mean all of them. I can't even begin to explain how funny this movie is as well. The first was funny, but not laugh out loud, hilarious funny. Of course, most of these funny scenes involve the scene-stealing Jack Sparrow. So, even though it's dark, the funniness and fun make up for it. Now before I wrap it up, I have one thing to say to all the critics who disliked ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest""; those who couldn't enjoy a pirate, swashbuckling film for 150 minutes, must really have ants in their pants. So all ye scurvy knaves, get ye to thee nearest theatre, and prepare for the time of ye life. Arr. <br/><br/>I give it a 10, no wait, make that infinity out of 10."

","Following the smash hit Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl surprised audiences (as well as Hollywood when it grossed over $300 million) with Depp's savvy performance as the notorious Captain Jack Sparrow and Bloom's performance as William Turner the local blacksmith, did Disney decide that it would be a great idea to capitalize a new franchise. Marketing for the second Pirates of the Caribbean began before a second trailer was even released in theaters. Disney was hungry, and thank God they were. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is a film worthy of the term ""blockbuster.""<br/><br/>The film starts off with the same musical score as the previous, but we soon find out that something wrong is happening as the score's mood changes and reveals the royal forces scatter across Port Royal. The score can make or break a film. Curse of the Black Pearl had such an amazing score that it was interesting what the new composer would do. Hans Zimmer honored the last films themes and blended them into his new score. Dead Man's Chest score is more electric than the previous orchestral Curse of the Black Pearl, but it still adds to the comedy and action in the film.<br/><br/>Most of the cast from Curse of the Black Pearl returned in this installment. Some notable baddies gone good are formerly damned Pintel (Lee Arenberg) and Ragaetti (Mackenzie Crook), who find the Pearl beached on Cannibal Island. They go to take it as their own, but the crew shows up after escaping the islanders. Their performance again provide nothing more than comical relief, nothing more and certainly nothing less. Another returning character is former Commodore Norrington. He has been pursuing Jack and the Pearl since Jack escaped the noose in Port Royal. Norrington describes his ""story"" To Gibbs as being, ""One chapter behind yours."" <br/><br/>Keira Knightley plays a more renegade Elizabeth Swann. She goes looking for Will, who has been sent to take Jack's compass and bring it back to Lord Beckett (who is now in control of Port Royal), and ends up on Tortuga when Jack and his crew are there. She also miraculously runs into former Commodore Norrington in a bar fight! Knightley's performance as Swann was nothing less than magnificent. She was impeccable in her sword-fighting debut. The highlight of her character was the tantrum she through as Norrington, Sparrow, and Turner fought. And the shocker with her character in this film is her attraction to Jack. Twice as she holds the compass (that shows the barer what s/he most desires) it points to Sparrow. In the end, she seduces Jack, which in turn lets her chain him to the deck of the Pearl as everyone abandons ship.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom's performance of William Turner in this installment seemed a bit off. Its one of those things that you just can't put your finger on, but the level of arrogance that Will has in this film bothered me. Other than that Orlando's performance wasn't anything special.<br/><br/>In other reviews Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest has been smashed, because most of the sword fighting action didn't occur until (probably) reel six. In Curse of the Black Pearl the action was there in the very beginning. The plot took off quickly where in Dead Man's Chest; the plot takes a while to develop into the nonstop action we are accustom to.<br/><br/>Issues  The trailer had so much spliced audio that it misled many as to what to expect.  Alternate angles and takes were placed into the trailer. Example: Will: I'm not leaving without Jack. Shot shows Jack running away from the islanders. Will cont'd: Never mind let's go! In the final cut it was changed to, Will: I'm not leaving without Jack. Shot shows Jack running away from the islanders. Will cont'd: Time to go.  The humor wasn't as clever as the first film. Most of the things that made the audience laugh was elementary school level comedy. Example: Jack falling down the stairs as he's holding his jar of dirt.  In the scene with the Black Pearl at the beginning of the film, we see that there is that ominous fog surrounding the ship as it did in the first film. This led me to believe that the ship still produced the shroud of fog as in the first film. When the Flying Dutchman attacks the Black Pearl, there is no fog!  If the movie were to be rated by physics, it would fail across the board. Jack free falling from the top of a mountain lands on the ground in one piece. Any normal person would have been dead and if not, they would have a dislocated hip, a few broken ribs, and a lot of splinters. The fight on the wheel is almost 100% impossible. Physics Hollywood! Physics!!!<br/><br/>Final Issue: Hollywood<br/><br/>Why does Hollywood always have to improve on a good deal? There were very few loose ends that could spawn a sequel yet they did and with it they created a marketing monster. With the third films' shooting starting in August, rumors are already surfacing about a possible FOURTH Pirates of the Caribbean film. However, I have yet to confirm this information, but I have been told that Johnny Depp is retiring his role of Captain Jack Sparrow after the completion of the third film. If he doesn't a fourth is bound to be made.<br/><br/>Overall Dead Man's Chest was a great action flick with stunning visual and special effects that show just how far movie making has come over the past century. Take the kids, take your girlfriend, take a random stranger to it, its worth every penny. Oh, don't be surprised if by the second time you've seen the movie you've already started to quote Captain Jack Sparrow. It's okay to do that, savvy?"
"whatshername007","10","0","1","9 July 2006"," Wow!
","i just got back from seeing 'Dead man's chest' and was impressed tremendously by it! After seeing the first one i didn't have high hopes for the second but it was amazing, the special effects were unbelievable and the acting was great! The end was horrible for anyone like me to see, as now i have to see the third one next year.<br/><br/>A definite date for my diary.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp has always been a favourite of mine and hasn't dampened my spirits in this film, his acting, his looks his humour all showed through in the movie and was really as exciting to watch as he is to look at! So anyone that even slightly liked the first 'Pirates Of The Carbbean', must watch the second( and the third next year of course)unless you really want to miss out on a fantastic experience!<br/><br/>10/10"
"mikhalt","9","0","1","9 July 2006"," New pirates movie awesome
","so this new pirates movie that I saw just saw yesterday has an alright plot. Not as strong as the first one, but still sufficient to deliver I guess. This movie has action, no romance, and lots of pirates. There are many times in the story where I knew what was going to happen. so that is not a good sign when you can predict the plot twist of the film. So those kind of things were not well hidden in the film. I am trying my best not to give out anything that has to do with the film. So go, take your children along to your local cinema and give it a try. You might like it yourself. In my opinion the first one was better, but this one makes up for the wait. For families this is a great film clean all the way through barely anyone gets stabbed and such. Thank you for your time Mikhal T"
"renegadeheart","9","0","1","9 July 2006"," As soon as the action starts.
","I have to say it started off a little slow. It also felt like they were really pulling for laughs in the beginning which was very unlike the first movie. Anything Jack did you found funny. However, as soon as the action started, not only did the movie pick up, but the comedy as well. I got lost in it.<br/><br/>It was much darker and dealt with deeper issues, some characters do some unexpected things and have pretty deep conversations. There are many old faces from the first movie and a lot of new ones with Davey Jones and his crew as well as a new addition to the protagonist side, Tia Dalma.<br/><br/>The ending I thought was fantastic even though I know it confused a lot of people. It was very abrupt, I heard a lot of people commenting on that as they left the theatre but overall I quite enjoyed it. I really think their goal is to get you back in theatre next year for the 3rd movie and it worked on me!<br/><br/>While not as good as the first movie, it holds up as a sequel."
"dpoll390","7","0","1","9 July 2006"," Terrific sequel
","In my eyes the third best Disney movie ever created only to Miracle and its predecessor The Curse of the Black Pearl. It's hard to make a sequel worthy of such an extraordinary work of art as the original ""Pirates"" was. However this movie more than does it. Everything about this movie is incredibly done. And I believe that if it were not in fact, a sequel, it would be considered even better. But don't look at this movie as a sequel, it's not really much of a follow up on the first movie except for some famous lines taken from it and a couple of cameos and familiar names that show up but I won't ruin any of the surprises. As always in this movie you never know where allegiance lies, that is why both movie will be a success.<br/><br/>If there were any mistakes in this movie it was trying to make Orlando Bloom funny. It's not the writers' fault, he's just not funny. He does a good acting job other than that, he becomes a bit more like a pirate as well which is good to see. Kiera Knightly is stunning and delivers the goods as usual. Her character develops more into someone who takes charge as you will see in this movie if you haven't already seen it. You'll be surprised at the incredible effect she has on this movie. And as always Mr. Depp delivers and this time he delivers coming back as the witty, drunken, ladies man, pirate, yet courageous good man Jack Sparrow. The character is a gem of a character that has never been matched before in any other movie ever created. The other thing about this movie that may anger some is you'll wish there was more of a resolved plot, it's a bit sketchy but pay attention, and it'll all make sense. The reason the plot is unresolved is because the movie is a complete set-up for the third movie.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is terrific, go see it. 9/10"

","I begged my mother to let me see this movie!! I loved Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, so I needed to see this movie the day it came out! And I did!! All the sequels I have seen (with the exception of Star Wars and Harry Potter) were so terrible!! This is a major exception! The camera work in this movie, was excellent!! Whoever did the cameras, I applaud you! This movie seemed much funnier than the first one and much more scary at the same time. Pirates 2 played with all of your emotions: happy, scared, suspense, romance, terror, sympathy... The list goes on and on!! <br/><br/>Johnny Depp... This man is GOD!!! Whatever you see him in, he is always amazing!! GEEZ!! He even walks in character! How many actors do you know, that do that?! Jack Sparrow can be so cruel and so sarcastically funny, that Johnny Depp nails it in every single scene, with every single line, with every single movement. And this is coming from someone who isn't freakishly obsessed with the guy! <br/><br/>Orlando Bloom. Have you ever seen him in anything where he is in the tiniest bit funny? I don't know if it was the lines, or him, but he had a few funny parts. When he gets upset, wow. I feel for him. I really do. Earlier that week, my brother is telling me that he isn't a great actor. This man could do silent films; he wears his heart on his sleeve. <br/><br/>Kiera Knightly, well... I haven't seen her in anything else except for the 1 and 2 of these movies, so I don't have much to compare her to. I think she did a great job where she was trying to make Jack believe something (I don't want to spoil it for the rest of you). I was right there with him! She's a fabulous liar, a fabulous actress. <br/><br/>I don't think that this movie should be as long as it is. Two and a half hours... That's what Harry Potter is for. They could have left out the whole 3-way sword fight. Granted, it was quite funny, but it took up too much time for such a senseless act. <br/><br/>This was, in fact, scarier than the first one. The squid, the violence, the CGI, etc. I would recommend this movie to anyone I met!! Granted, kinds under a certain age... probably not. But this movie deserves whatever they get for all of the hard work put into it.<br/><br/>ACADEMY AWARDS, HERE PIRATES 2 COMES!!"
"Transient-Orca","9","0","1","9 July 2006"," A movie you can't really compare to the Original
","I was so excited when I first saw the trailer for this movie about 6 months ago, I think it was. I was such a die-hard fan of the first one.<br/><br/>Now after having seen it, I am a little mixed on how good it was. In it's own self, It was very good. But compared to the first, it was so different, and not comparable to the first.<br/><br/>Although, if you did not see the first one, you will be totally lost in the second one. The only problem with the second one is that Verbinski (director) not only thinks you have seen the first one, but have scrutinized every little detail of the movie. Now, I am not afraid to admit that I have done that, so I saw every little ""inside"" joke that was out there. <br/><br/>Another thing I did not like, was in the trailer and some other reviews they made the movie almost cheery and fun, but no. The film is much darker than the first. More gruesome and far darker. Although in it's darkness, come the funniest Jokes that you will laugh out loud to, and pretty hard in some scenes.<br/><br/>The greatest thing was that the characters of Elizabeth and William are far more developed, or so it seems to me. What really surprised me was that William Turner had a bigger part in this movie, and you got to see a darker side of him. It gave much more depth to his character than before. Elizabeth also shows some of her dark side. Now I can't give to much away or I will ruin the biggest surprise at the ending. All I am going to say is, There is going to be hell to pay in the third movie.<br/><br/>I thought Captian Jack Sparrow was a total ass in the second, even more so than in the first one. Compare the first and second, Jack was a noble hero almost compared to him in the second!!! There were many times I just wanted to slap him and yet, I just could't help but laugh, and enjoy all of his antics. You defiantly see a side of these characters you never thought existed. I was surprised, but not totally.<br/><br/>When you go to see the second movie, try not to compare how good or bad it is to the first. But keep it in mind, instead. You may really enjoy it."
"kymmr2","10","0","1","9 July 2006"," Better movie, with less laughs...
","I saw this movie the 1st day it was released. I quickly got my tickets online in advance, and boy was I glad. People stormed the theater just waiting to see their favorite pirates again. And I must say I was NOT disappointed. POTC Dead Man's Chest was a tremendous thriller, with action every where you look. What makes it so different from the first, is the lack of comedian laughs. Which for this movie is a good thing. This was a much darker movie than the first, with characters (especially Depp) showing much different sides of their characters. The actors again take to their parts perfectly, even maybe a bit more perfectly than the first. The CGI effects were fantastic, and the sequences were unbelievable. Lots of new lovable characters appear in this movie. This movie still has some laughs, but you won't laugh the whole time like last time. It's a better movie, with less laughs. And after seeing it, you'll be glad the 3rd movie is coming in less than a year."
"cmkoivu","10","0","1","9 July 2006"," Better than the First One
","There is a lot of action and fun in this movie. It is definitely better than the first, it has to be, it is a Disney film. Black Pearl came across more as an advertisement for the ride than as a movie. This film has more meat to it, and it is a lot of fun. There is a Lot of internal conflicts between the characters, a lot of surprises and close calls. This movie goes more into the story of the characters than Black Pearl. It will have you at the edge of your seat, it will make you laugh, and it is non stop fun. This is the best movie I have seen coming out of Hollywood in a while. It is definitely better than the other summer films. I was pleased with the plot and the special effects that were in this movie."

","OK. I LOVE the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie. Absolutely love it. So, of course, I had high expectations of ""Dead Man's Chest"".<br/><br/>The acting was superb. Johnny Depp showed us all, yet again, the Cap. Jack Sparrow can only be done by Johnny Depp, Keira Knightley delivered an impeccable performance, and Orlando Bloom did an awesome job as Will Turner.<br/><br/>The effects were great as well! I think all the animators for the film should be very proud of themselves.<br/><br/>But, alas, there are flaws. First of all, I pity anyone who didn't see the first movie that's coming in to see this one. They won't understand ANY of the wonderful humor, or even the plot and characters. Also, the last fifteen minutes disappointed me. Although the plot was moving, you KNEW that it was simply a set-up for the third movie, releasing in 2007! The last scene cuts off so suddenly that I was left sitting in my seat going, ""Uh...where's the last 5 minutes of movie?"" <br/><br/>So, basically, I love the series, I love the idea, I love the acting, I love the way they did this film, but ""Dead Man's Chest"" is no ""Curse of the Black Pearl"", and is almost an advertisement for the third, untitled, Pirates movie."
"christian__scott","7","0","1","9 July 2006"," Disney does Empire Strikes Back
","After coming out of this film, I felt a little somewhat disappointed at first, feeling that maybe some of the magic that made the first such a sleeper hit, was gone as everyone involved knew that this one would be an instant smash this time around. By the end credits I thought my fears of the next two pirate films doing a matrix 2&3 and being lesser than the first one, but after thinking about it more and more, the better it became. All the humour of the first was there, as were the characters (not overplayed at all) it was just more of the same. The film is certainly a lot darker and more serious in this one(not sure if we need to see an eye being pecked out...bit much for a 12a),with the villains being a lot more threatening in their behaviour. It was beautifully shot (opening shots in the rain, amazing) and the wheel chase was great, some cgi was iffy in places (davy Jones, could swear is real, kraken...haha, where's the blue screen) but as a whole it's wonderful stuff. As with the first, Depp steals the show while Bloom and Knightly look pretty. it was my girlfriend who made the comparison to Empire, so the credit's all hers, (you'll know what I mean once you've seen it and have seen the original star wars trilogy) the film is dark, and you definitely want to know what happens next. Let's just hope there's no Ewoks."

","The problem with creating a hit movie, is that people evidently expect you to create a sequel, which in turn create a new and unforeseen problem, where do we go from here??

The most important aspect of the movie, it does have EXCELLENT content for plot, and great writing.

"MarshallStax","5","0","3","9 July 2006"," More of the same. Lots more.
","I found the first ""Pirates"" movie to be an unexpected delight. I had never seen a pirate movie I liked before, so I went in interested but with low hopes. After all, this was a film with a troubled production, whose shoot went significantly over schedule and budget. Reshoots were employed. These are usually bad signs for a movie and bode ill for its ultimate disposition. And really - a movie based on an amusement park ride?<br/><br/>However, from the surprisingly convoluted but still neatly self-connected plot to the top drawer visual effects and of course the performances (including Depp's, an actor I had never previously had much opinion of), ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" turned out to be so much more than I had thought it would be. As one reviewer somewhere said (L.A. Weekly, I think), these are movies for people who do not like pirate movies.<br/><br/>Count me in! I like to have my buckle swashed from time to time, but I do not count myself a pirate movie fan. Yet I LOVED ""Curse of the Black Pearl"".<br/><br/>So, I was really looking forward to the release of Dead Man's Chest. Bill Nighy was an added bonus; I saw he was to play Davey Jones (he of the locker). I loved his work in the ""Underworld"" films, ""Love Actually"" and ""Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"".<br/><br/>The plot sounded promising; Jack Sparrow owes a debt to Davey Jones: his soul! He does everything in his power to get out of repaying it, including enlisting the help of every character from the first movie. <br/><br/>So where did it all go wrong?<br/><br/>The movie is too damned long. There are too many characters. Not enough happens of significance; too much happens for the sake of on screen action. Time is elastic in the plot; people travel to and from ports and islands with amazing rapidity, to the point where the audience is wondering if these people have simply developed the power of teleportation. And really, this feels more like a remake than a sequel. Phantom ship? Check. Supernaturally enhanced crew? Check. Curse? Check. Outrageously staged sword fights? Check. Etc...<br/><br/>The special effects are as amazing as ever, though the kraken both appears too often and yet not enough of it is seen each time.<br/><br/>Sadly, the movie is more an endurance contest than a giddy ride. In fact, it is very much like the ""dark tunnel"" amusement park ride: sit down and watch everything scroll by without actually caring about or being a part of it. Characters are already established from the first film (a dozen or so) and nobody grows or changes except for maybe, maybe a glimmer out of Jack and Elizabeth.<br/><br/>Special note here about Johnny Depp: Jack Sparrow was very much a one-note performance in the first film, but enjoyable due to the character's unpredictability. As written here, Jack is as predictable as gravity, and about as interesting. He is a dead center in a film that desperately needs a live one, and no amount of fey sashaying or uncoordinated sprinting at the head of a cannibal tribe does anything to change that.<br/><br/>Plotwise, things just happen and happen and happen in this movie to the point of boredom; what should be a rousing three-way swordfight on a rolling mill water wheel is just dull and the kraken attacks (all four of them) are simply variations on a theme.<br/><br/>The creative team here has really used the last ounce of goodwill they generated with ""Curse of the Black Pearl"" to create this loud, frequently boring, sporadically amusing and overlong mess. <br/><br/>At least the next (and last?) film will tie up all plot threads from this one and hopefully give us a rousing, satisfying end to this stuff."
"honolua88","8","0","1","8 July 2006"," ""Pirates"" Returns-Sexier, Scarier, and more Action-Packed
","The same salty swashbuckling fun is back for part two of the (presumably) three part Pirates of the Caribbean Saga, in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. Your favorite characters return and continue to entertain with their high-seas highjinks, which include: trying to escape from never-ending perils, continually switching sides and tricking each other mercilessly, as well as engaging in swordplay and romance- all done as Captain Jack spouts jokes and jibes, as usual. Though this second film is undeniably charming, it lacks the humorous edge of the first. While there are amusing lines and moments, they do not seem to be as meticulously scripted and are not quite as seamlessly worked into the plot as were the jokes in the first Pirates film. Also, almost everything that viewers counted on as fact of at the end of the first film is challenged and becomes quite convoluted by the end the second installment. Dead Man's Chest also bumps up the aspect of sensuality and tension between several characters, and the film ends with a cliffhanger on several levels. All of these aspects will likely delight some characters and disillusion others. Finally, while ""The Curse of the Black Pearl"" allowed several large blocks of time for character development, the action sequences of ""Dead Man's Chest"" are continuous and intense, and the lulls are few and far between. In short, if you loved the first, you'll at least enjoy the second, perhaps you'll even find Dead Man's Chest to be the better of the two. However, that final opinion must be left to you, the individual viewer. Savvy?"
"bostonbrown","6","0","1","8 July 2006"," Some Treasures Shouldn't Be Buried
","This is one of those treasures.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with lots of expectation thanks to the the first installment of the trilogy being so amazing. The problem with expectation is that it is easily disappointed. That's why it's that much more amazing that this movie surpassed my high expectation.<br/><br/>Once again, the story is fantastically written. I was held captive in my seat throughout the entirety of the movie. And the ending was so compelling that I wish the third movie came out tomorrow.<br/><br/>The creatures were kind of weird bringing this trilogy even more into the fantastical realm, but due to the quality of the storyline and how well they fit with the plot, I couldn't imagine the movie without them. This was the one thing I was unsure about in the previews.<br/><br/>The acting was excellent also. This cast was so well chosen.<br/><br/>Some people have complained about the lack of ending in this movie. However, like any other good trilogy (i.e. Lord of the Rings) the second movie shouldn't have an ending. A trilogy is best done when one story is spread out over multiple movies. This is what makes it a trilogy and not just three separate movies which share a similar name. Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is best when seen in conjunction with Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. That's what makes it good. The first Pirates can stand alone as there was an ending of sorts. In the second one, they've done a good job of connecting it with the first one. Still, once the third one comes out, everyone will be happy that they did the second one as they did. It's tough to rate a trilogy when you haven't seen all 3 parts. People tried to do that with X-Men. It had a good first movie and amazing second movie. The problem is that the second movie was so good, the third one seemed bad in comparison. They made the mistake of climaxing in the second installment. The third movie should always be the best in a trilogy and the second the ""worst"" or else it just won't work. If At World's End is amazing, everyone will speak of how amazing the trilogy is and no one will complain about Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Then only question which remains is will the third live up to the hype due to the amazing quality of the first two. That question will be answered at world's end."

","Okay this movie is one of the best I have seen in awhile its topped movies such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Harry Potter in my opinion. POTC: Dead Man's Chest is to say least is an excellent example of what a fine film can be. The plot line well to the observant viewer is quite obvisious completes and sets up the entire movie for the next movie. And with a 4-part cliffhanger ending it leaves you wanting more.<br/><br/>This movie with almost non-stop laughs and plenty of jump scenes to keep you on keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next move. Dead Man's Chest has scenes to make you laugh, cry, scream, and some to make you just go uwaggh! It also contains something for everyone action, adventure, romance, comedy, and even some scary scenes! While, I wholeheartedly enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl I have to say Dead Man's Chest was a flash of brilliance for director Gore Verbronski. The movie which in my opinion is better than the first, and geared more towards the teenage audience even than the first. Dead Man's Chest is an excellent way to set you up for another movie and make you want to watch it again and again.<br/><br/>**************************SPOILER STARTS HERE************************** Dead Man's Chest included lines that we heard on passing in the Black Pearl such as the line Jack says in the first one was ""And then they made me their chief."" comes back to a whole sequence. Of Jack being chief of this tribe its classic.<br/><br/>My opinion on the crowing glory of this film is the scene where you see the giant watermill fighting on this watermill are Jack, Will and James Norrington. The watermill breaks free of an old church on rolls away with Will and James on top fighting and it rolls over Jack capturing him inbetween two of the slats of the watermill lifting him until he is dropped inside of the watermill and ends up getting knocked out by a metal bar. Then it transfers to Elizabeth fighting two of the pirates from the first movie on the black pearl. The next time you see the watermill its rolling past where Elizabeth and the two pirates are fighting and Jack is running behind it trying to catch up it was hilarious. I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe."

","Of the original Star Wars movies, my least favorite of the three is The Empire Strikes Back. After the final ""Pirates"" film comes out next year, I think I'll be saying the same about ""Dead Man's Chest"", and for essentially the same reasons. Which, of course, doesn't mean it's a bad movie, just not as great as its bookends.<br/><br/>Actually there are quite a few similarities between these two films, but it would be extremely difficult to go into any details without including any spoilers. Suffice it to say that Captain Jack Sparrow and Han Solo have more in common than their roguish ways.<br/><br/>DMC seems to suffer a bit from ""middle movie syndrome"". It has everything the first Pirates movie had -- action, adventure, comedy, romance, undead monkeys -- but it doesn't seem to always be sure of where it's going with it all. The characters and sets are, if anything, more colorful and impressive the second time around, but pacing problems make this longish movie (at 2 hours and 30 minutes) seem even longer. Fans of the series won't much care, though, especially as the third film is a certainty, and Dead Man's Chest sets the stage for a truly epic finale."

","This movie amazed me. I knew I was going to enjoy it. I knew I was going to laugh and grin. I knew this and had confidence in the film because of Johnny Depp. He made the first movie, he was the reason I watched (and continue to watch) it over and over again. I fell in love with Jack Sparrow and doubt I'll ever fall out of his spell. But with this movie came a couple of major surprises: I wasn't only laughing and grinning, I was at the edge of my seat and anxious for the next scene. And it is more than Johnny Depp that I will return to the theaters again as often as I (financially) can allow.<br/><br/>Orlando Bloom can act! His character is better rounded, there's more to his story, and his scenes without Depp stood out beautifully. I think he learned a lot in the past couple years. Miss Knightly also did a nice job and came out as more of the rogue Englishwoman I wanted and imagined her to be. The majority of familiar faces (and favorites!) from the first movie show up throughout the course of the film as well, wonderfully enough! And it works, which is really the amazing part. This movie drew on the good points of the first but didn't nag anything to death. Don't worry about the previews where things seem to cheesy--sure, they may be walking that edge of hilarity, but they are well balanced by other serious plot lines and the more anxiety-packed moments.<br/><br/>I can honestly say this is the best sequel I've ever seen (excluding the original Star Wars films) especially considering that the first movie was probably written independently. This compliments the first movie so well, in fact, that I think I liked it more than the first. Nothing can ever be on the same level as an original, it's true, but this movie went above and beyond by drawing me in on all fronts this time around. I'll watch the first movie again and again for Jack, but its sequels will be the more satisfying for me."
"lilshoe1709","10","0","1","8 July 2006"," Great movie...
","It was funny and serious, but mostly funny, I laughed quite a lot...it was better then the first one in my opinion It had some really good effects The over all story line was well thought out I liked Jack Sparrow a lot more now than from the first one I got to know William a lot better too Although the whole scene on the island where Davy Jone's heart is doesn't really run along with the movie, it is a lot less serious when they are fighting on the water thing...although funny, it was a little unreal... But all in all it was a good movie It had some really good humor Oh and I only jumped twice from sudden changes...lol...I can't wait for the 3rd because the very last line of the film was suspenseful making you yearn for the next movie to come out..."

","This movie was exciting, and very well put together to me. But it was also a slight confusing. The end defiantly leaves you completely on the edge of insanity. I CANT WAIT TILL THE NEXT ONE COMES OUT. Just so I can find how why The Captain came back, and what The voodoo priestess had to do with all of this. I would also like to know what is going to happen with Will and his Father, and Will and Kera Knightly's character (Kate I think). I don't know about you but I'm also thinking that the Voodoo priestess is Davy Jones' long lost lover but I'm not sure. But all in all this movie is defiantly one that you should go out and experience in the theatre for yourself!"

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest/2006/***<br/><br/>Main Stars: Johnny Depp Orlando Bloom Keira Knightley Bill Nighy<br/><br/>Am I the only one in the state of Florida that actually likes this film? Maybe so. The movie was definitely not disappointing. The people that didn't like it that much should think so to which is pretty much everyone. The movie was cleverly written and well-done special effects wise. The movie, however, switched between many scenes and that's what kinda ruined the fun for the scene you were first watching. It also flips over to the power-hungry ruler in Britain who wants all the ships for himself. Meanwhile we have Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) acting his usual self- drunk who owes a debt to Davey Jones (Bill Nighy), captain of The Flying Dutchman and the sea himself. Oh, but what does Jack owe? Why would I tell you and ruin the movie for you just like a local critic ruined it for me by telling in his article that there was a surprising guest appearance right before fade-out and actually gave the person's name away, that idiot. I would have preferred to see it myself, thank you very much. But it's over now and I saw who it was and, when you think about it, you could have suspected this person after the crew of The Black Pearl asked the question that made the person clomp down the steps of the tiny building which housed a woman that spoke horrible English. Like instead of saying ""Earth"" she'd say ""Eart"". Some things she said I didn't even understand because the stupid woman can't speak English very well! That made me mad but the story was not complicated. It was cleverly written as I already pointed out and well-done. However, it was not great because of the one reason of flipping between so many scenes when you were just starting to enjoy the first fight or confrontation and getting into the music which was originally composed by the brilliant Klaus Badelt who made the ""Pirates"" soundtrack so famous and taken over by none other than Hans Zimmer, the extremely odd German composer. Trust me, he's odd. I've seen the way he acts and he's a bit goofy. But he was of course serious for this film and did an extremely fantastic job. However, the film didn't seem to have the best directing. Gore Verbinski, the Polish director who directed the first ""Pirates"" movie and The Ring. Yes, an odd career isn't it. Two completely different films indeed. So he comes back to direct this one and doesn't pronounce it as much as he did in the first which he directed Geoffrey Rush (as Captain Barbossa) and did a brilliant job. Rush, a serious actor, did a wonderful job as being humorous and using humorous facial expressions. He also had that dry humor in his voice especially when he said ""Why THANK you, Jack."" Sparrow says your welcome. Barbossa replies, ""Not you; we named the MONKEY Jack."" Dry humor plus the facial expressions (mainly the bulging eyes) made him the star of the film which was impressive. This one was still impressive though with Bill Nighy (as Davey Jones) playing the villain very well although not very humorous, more evil and there's nothing bad about that. Then there's Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) being his usual serious self just like in the first film and is SUPPOSED to be married to Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) but the marriage was interrupted by this adventure of Davey Jones and the rest of his crew on THE FLYING DUTCHMAN. Bootstrap Bill Turner should I say? Nah. You find out about him and you will believe me. As you know already, Johnny Depp has something to give Jones and also, as I said before, I won't spoil anything for you because I'm not an idiot. Norrington (Jack Davenport), as you know from the first as Commodore Norrington, is also involved in this film but is only minor so nothing spoiled really. However, what he does is another thing and he does something significant toward the end of the film There's of course more to this 150 minute (2½ hour film) because it's so darn long but those are only minor details but details that are still fun to watch. Okay so some extra details are significant but my job is to give you the plot outline or gist of the film and of course tell you if I liked it or not. And I did like it but those flipping scenes; the not as pronounced directing; and some other minor mistakes in the script that didn't flow correctly only made it good. But you can already tell I liked it by my star rating. Movie directed by Gore Verbinski."

","It is an enjoyable movie to be sure, but cannot compare to the first. Dead Man's Chest is a typical sequel; clichéd. It alternates between being funny and irritating. The plot lacked substance and draaaagged like you wouldn't believe. The characters sometimes overdid their roles, but this is expected of a sequel. The movie was one action sequence after another and never reached a climax. Furthermore, everything about the movie was just so.. convenient. For example, a character would conveniently show up at the most opportune moment, even when said arrival defies logic and possibility. The film is incapable of standing up on its own. Fortunately, it doesn't have to. This film is buildup to the third, and in that respect Dead Man's Chest was highly successful, leaving the viewer anxious for a third installment which by the looks of it is GOING TO BE AWESOME.<br/><br/>All in all, I did enjoy the movie. It was nice seeing ALL the characters back at it and the ending, predictable though it may be, is wicked. Or at least it made me VERY happy, and I was about to be disappointed in the flick. So despite all the film's VAST shortcomings, it's a decided 'must-see'."

","The theater was packed when I went to see POTC: Dead Man's Chest. The movie lived up to the hype - it was entertainment overload. From the CGI, to the incredible believable acting, to the set designs and the constant backdrop of the ocean I loved every sensory feeling the movie evoked. The story intrigued to the point of wanting to go to Disneyland to ride the ride again. Even though some say the movie was long, the story never dragged. The introduction of new characters -- Davey Jones (fabulous), creepy voodoo witch/woman on the island, and the East Indies Sugar Co. guy Beckett was refreshing and did their parts perfectly. I love monster movies so when the Kraken was released to annihilate ships it was an awesome thing to see.<br/><br/>I've seen the other films slated for blockbuster this summer and this one is by far the best one I've seen. IMHO, it wins the contest.<br/><br/>Now the ending of the film -- left me speechless. The third installment of this trilogy better explain everything and make me want to buy it when it becomes available on DVD."
"griffolyon12","7","0","1","8 July 2006"," Good.but not as good as the first.
","When this film was announced I was very skeptical,I thought the first one didn't need a sequel.So going into the film my expectations were somewhat low,but a repeated viewing of the first one before I saw this one got me excited about seeing it.When I finally saw it I have to say it met my expectations.Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man's Chest was a good movie,but just not as good as the original.<br/><br/>The film starts with Will and Elizabeth being arrested on their wedding day by Lord Becket(a British officer)for assisting Jack Sparrow in escaping in the first film.Becket makes Will go find Jack and take Jack's compass and bring it back to him in exchange for his and Elizabeth's freedom.As Will searches for Jack we learn that Jack owes a debt to the squid faced Davy Jones and the only way to get out of it is to find the Dead Man's Chest.<br/><br/>Probably the most interesting aspect of this film is the story,it is both the strongest and weakest part of the film.I loved how it expanded on all of the characters from the first film,and the plot is very original and unique.The plot was amazing,but the execution of it in the story was not as amazing.The pacing was at many times bad,and I found the story very confusing at times and hard to follow(part of this problem comes from some of the actors hard to understand accents).Everything else in the film was all top notch.The directing was wonderful,and the special effects were superb(a big pat on the back for ILM).The acting was just as good as it was in the original(partly because most of the cast returned).<br/><br/>My biggest problem with this film was the lack of action.I know in a sequel you must have more story,but there was very little action.One of the biggest problems with the action was the bad pacing of the action.There was very little action until the very end,but the action at the end was really great.My only other gripe is Jack Sparrow,now he is hilarious but they basically put this film on his shoulders and his slapstick jokes got old after about halfway through the film.<br/><br/>All in all this film is a really good popcorn movie,and many will watch this and love it but I just wanted a little more from it.I loved the first film and was sadly disappointed with this sequel.It is still way better than most other films this year(except Superman Returns which is still my favorite).<br/><br/>Score:A good 7 out of 10!"
"centvriox","7","0","2","8 July 2006"," False Advertising!!??
","First of all, this movie should have been titled ""Dead Man's Chest, PART ONE!""...or ""Pirates III, PART ONE!"" It is, for all intents and purposes, merely the first 2 1/2 hours of a 5 hour movie. I recall that ""Back to the Future II"" suffered from the same syndrome and was widely criticized for being nothing more than a 2 hour ad for #3! Don't expect a happy ending, heck, don't expect an an ending at ALL! The Barbossa ""surprise"" in the last scene was very enjoyable but ticked me off even MORE because I realized I'd have to wait a YEAR to see the REST of the film. The overblown CGI reminds me of Star Wars II (""Clones"") where they pretty much went NUTS and did CGI for CGI's sake. Jack did WAY too much ""mincing"" this time. He's supposed to be hetero (???) so why is he flouncing around like the grand marshal of the Gay Pride Parade? He did just enough in #1 but, as is typical of Hollywood, I guess he figured more is better. btw Jack, when running for your life, leaning BACKWARDS looks cute and ""swishy"" but is hardly promotes maximum speed. Finally, was all the GORE in what is *allegedly* a Disney movie necessary? I mean, do the tiny crumb-crunchers in the audience really need to see eyes plucked out etc. etc.? Yes, yes, of course it was worth seeing but I hope #3 improves on #2."

","I have seen many movies this year, and personally this was my favorite. CAPTAIN(!!!!) Jack Sparrow is back in this hilarious film. Once again he is funny, and witty, while being completely serious at the same time. Will and Elizabeth get arrested in the beginning for helping Jack, and the only way for Will to be free, is to fall into one of Jacks, yet again, devious plans. Elizabeth escapes and looks for Will which causes her to be found on The Black pearl, again. The old crew is back, including a couple of new members, who are funny in their own way. You won't want to miss the third movie, for it will contain plenty of unanswered questions. Also you may want to re-see the first movie, for this movie has many references of the Black Pearl.

","I was delighted with this follow up to the first ""Pirates"" film. The story is engaging and inventive (and not a copy of the first film, like some sequels), the action is unparalleled, the visual effects are stunning, and the performances are captivating. The characters gain more and more depth as the story continues and we are surprised to see what has become of them since we last saw them and what decisions are made as the adventure continues. As with any good second film in a trilogy, we're left with just enough dissatisfaction to make us anxious for the third film. Every question we got answered was replaced by 2 or 3 more. I definitely recommend it. The bang-for-the-buck is worth seeing it in the theater. With a swash and a buckle and a yo ho ho, a pirate's life is still for me, savvy?"

If you didn't go to the opening night of this movie or haven't seen it yet, SHAME ON YOU! Get out there and support this movie. Outside of the fact that in my personal opinion Johnny Depp is the single greatest actor to have ever lived, the director, all the actors, and everyone have really made a fine piece of cinema here, and supporting a movie as great as this one only inspires more movies like this to be made.

","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is the sequel to highly popular POTC: The Curse of the Black Pearl. And the sequel does not disappoint. It keeps almost all of the magic of the original. The music, action, and acting is just as good as it was before. The comedy is a little on the short end in this one. A few too many jokes about rum in my opinion. But that doesn't effect at all.<br/><br/>If you liked the first one, you surely will go see this one, and you'll enjoy, or at least, I hope you will because I did. It starts off a little slow, and sometimes can get a little crazy during the film but it's great nonetheless. It is s little long but in the end comes together perfectly with one of the greatest cliffhanger this movie-goer has ever seen. POTC:DMC is a movie the whole family can enjoy. Don't listen to what critics say about it being too cartoonish, too scary for little kids, and boring. This movie is none of those.<br/><br/>The Summer isn't even over, but Pirates 2, in my opinion, is the best movie the season has to offer. Savvy?"

There were some events in this one that I wasn't overly impressed with but overall it was good. Johhny Depp is absolutely hilarious and brilliant again as Captain Jack. I highly recommend it to any one who has seen the first one. I went to see this one with my mom who hasn't seen the Curse of the Black Pearl.

","The first movie was so fresh (for this century anyway) that there was no chance that any sequel was going to measure up. Dean Man's Chest came as close as I could expect. Johnny Depp's performance was astonishing in the first movie because all of the other characters lived in the real world. Jack Sparrow is less effective when everyone takes for granted that there are ghost ships sailed by Octopus looking half dead sea creatures. Bill Nighy was wasted under an avalanche of special effects. I didn't buy that Elizabeth would ever have any real connection to Jack. Her undying love for our hero is what makes the story old fashioned Hollywood fun. Jack would have to stop swaying for me to believe that Elizabeth would be conflicted about her feelings for him. What would be the fun of that? I love watching Orlando Bloom play a sword fighting hero though the action was too cartoon like. The swords might as well have been made of rubber. I never felt anyone was going to get hurt. Nothing hurt these people. This movie is a nice ride and worth the price of admission. However the first movie was such an unexpected pleasure that part of me wishes that they had just left it alone."

And much funnier than the first one. But I thought it left a lot of questions unanswered and forgot to fully explain new characters. So, you're watching scenes between these 2 or 3 people who are supposed to have some kind of meaningful past, but you don't know what type of relationship they had. So, you spend time trying to figure out what type or relationship it was instead of listening to the dialog they're having. And I'm not going to give away the ending, but I just think it was a bad ending."
"jdtrue-1","6","0","4","8 July 2006"," Not the Best Movie Ever!
","Major Spoiler Warning!!!!! It seems that Disney decided to follow in the footsteps of the Wachowski brother's with this sequel. Like the Matrix the first movie was a stellar production, but once it was decided that there were to be three installments the production became rather lack-luster. You can't call this the best movie ever because the damned thing hasn't ended! There is absolutely no conclusion to any portion of the story arc what-so-ever in this film. Like the Matrix the main character has been lost to the great unknown and the audience is left with nothing but expectations. It's like the cheap tricks that television series use at the end of the season, make a giant cliff hanger so all the fans will watch the season opener for the following year. I would expect more from a production of this quality, even if it is produced by Jerry Bruckheimer of CSI fame.<br/><br/>Another complaint I have is the slow opening with little or no explanation for what has happened during the intervening years. The letters of Mark offered by Lord Beckett seem nothing more than a poor construct to once again thrust Will and Elizabeth into the storyline. There's no explanation for the island from which Jack escapes in the coffin, nor how he or anyone else came to posses a picture of the key. And questions similar to these abound throughout the film.<br/><br/>While the acting is in top form, there are too many plot holes and inconsistencies which mar the effect. The comedy was little more than slapstick, with dreadful one liners that were funny, but didn't add to the effect. Several people have commented on the poor CGI effects. I have to admit this is the first movie I've been too in quite some time where I could actually see the screen in the background. When the Kraken rises behind Jack when he is chained to the mainsail you can see speckling on the screen around him, I haven't seen green-screen that shoddy in years.<br/><br/>I guess I'm just upset because I really felt that Dead Man's Chest, like the Curse of the Black Pearl, would be a complete in and of itself. Instead I felt the producers would have been better suited to borrow from Quentin Tarantino and title the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest volume I. There is no conclusion; Jack walks into the belly of the Kraken, Davy Jones returns to the briny deep, and lo and behold Barbossa is back from the dead.<br/><br/>Who knows maybe in the next installment they'll actually answer some questions and deliver a completed script?"
"diabolka1","8","0","1","8 July 2006"," Review of PotC: Dead Man's Chest
","The movie followed through with the humorous and irreverent theme from the original PotC to this one. There were references to the first movie in a variety of ways, bringing about much laughter and some groans of ""oh, they didn't"" but in general, well worth the tie-in. There were more subplots twisting and turning in this film than the original which can cause some confusion because of the speed and shortness of the those plots' background. The CGI work was quite good. The monsters were very much associated with the sea. The character development could have been a bit more fleshed out, however, it can be considered adequate for a second installment.<br/><br/>Of course, Captain Jack Sparrow had quite a few humorous lines. Elizabeth seemed to be more three-dimensional than in the first movie. Will held his own in this one and could have been even better if given the chance. Ragetti (one-eyed pirate) was a complete surprise with his spot-on insights and spouting of facts at times. The other characters weren't too bad either.<br/><br/>Summary: As the first movie was more of a surprise when it comes to Sparrow and the other characters, this one may seem less so because we already know what the characters are like. There are more subplots than necessary which can be confusing but they may be what is needed to use as a reference for the final movie when it comes out next year.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie. It is fun, light-hearted, action-packed and full of double entendre. 8/10 stars!"

","Well well well...what have we here? A sequel, daresay, to a very successful movie from the past. A movie of swashbuckling action, almost naked voodoo ladies, people with sea creatures for faces, love, a monkey, and Keith Richards dressed in drag. Maybe I missed the point? I don't know, but those where the things that stood out the most.<br/><br/>After a long wait for its fans, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest (henceforth called PotC:DMC) has finally been released, and no, unlike what my friend said, its not Rated Arrrrrr! (HAHAHAHAHA!!! LAUGH! Or I will KILL YOU!!!) Okay, stupid puns over, could this movie stand up to the first? Or would it just fall into that fast growing heap of movies that suffer sequelitis, a terrible condition where the sequel to a popular and successful movie is there just to cash in on its popularity. It makes no sense, has terrible acting, an atrocious plot, and bombs at the box-office.<br/><br/>I have to say, yes, it does stand up to the first, and in some ways, overshadows it. But, at the same time, it still falls into a slight case of sequelitis. The best overall way to approach this movie is without a brain. It isn't an overly complicated movie, and is more like one of those movies you just go to and enjoy, pretty much like the first one.<br/><br/>Like the first one, the movie is big, fun, and boisterous. Colorful characters, vibrant scenery, and lots of swashbuckling sword fights. Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) returns as the central story character, whereas in the first, he was a side character that stole the show. William Turners (Orlando Bloom) story gets placed on the backburner this time, as his and Elizabeths (Keira Knightley, a slightly manlier version of Orlando Bloom) love story isn't as important this go around. Depps portrayal of Sparrow again leaves all of us in amazement as he has yet to win a Best Actor award. Even though his character is a bit, uhmm, lets say light-footed, he is still a riot to watch. And, a side of Jack Sparrow you thought you would never see does come out near the climax of the film, and Depp plays it off perfectly. Depp is so convincing as Sparrow, but then again, when has Depp NOT been convincing.<br/><br/>Now, on the side of evil, we have yet another baddie that rivals Darth Vader as best acted villain of all time. Of course, its squid boy himself, Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), who wants Sparrows soul to join his crew of dead/undead/half-dead/sea creature/people/things on his ship, The Flying Dutchman. Bill Nighy, who happens to play one of my favorite rolls in my favorite movie (He was Philip, the step-father from Shaun of the Dead), ALMOST steals the show from Depp in his portrayal of the famed Jones. His story is a sad one, and at times, you almost feel sorry for him, not unlike the way you felt for Barbossa in the first film. Yeah, hes an evil S.O.B., but what he wants is so simple, yet so hard to obtain. A truly beautiful, yet terribly tragic character.<br/><br/>As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, for the most part they did well. Some of the side plots involving Bloom and Knightley were average, at best. But, I am not saying they did not entertain. Knightleys side story was exceptionally well done, and her acting is getting better with age. Bloom, on the other hand, seems to have hit a spot where he does the same character in every movie. It works for him, obviously, but it just doesn't do much for his credibility.<br/><br/>Now, as far as the movie itself is concerned, if you liked the first one be prepared, because it is more of the same. Just bigger. Bigger fights, bigger explosions, bigger ships, bigger monsters, and of course, bigger laughs. But, the first film had its flaws, and expect those to get bigger here in the second one as well. Really, the biggest flaw (aside from the absence of a Keira Knightley nude scene) is the only one worth mentioning: the plot. The plot in this movie seems so convoluted, so confusing, and that is the problem. It is a very simple plot at heart, and they try to do so many things with it. The first movie was so great because it was so simple. This film just tries to hard.<br/><br/>I'm not saying it was a bad movie by any means. It was probably the best movie so far this year, and the most fun I have had at the theater in a LONG time. After you start having fun, you don't notice any of the small flaws. Even Orlando starts to become entertaining! My opinion, go see it. It is well worth it. It may not be the deepest movie out there, or the best written, nor does it have the best acting (Depp and Nighy aside). But it does have heart, and you can tell that everyone involved in this movie had a lot of fun. And thats what it is all about. Have fun, and hope that the fun gets transposed onto film, and into the audience. And that, this film has accomplished beautifully!"

","I loved every single moment of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. Way better then the first in my opinion. It was just flat-out fun. If your looking for a great plot you may be slightly disappointed but if you go in just for fun and to have your breath taken away you'll have a blast. It's the most fun at the movies I've ever had. Johnny Depp is of course amazing as is Bill Nighy as Davy Jones whose character is one of the most spectacular, breathtaking villains in cinematic history. Keira Knightley and Orlando Bloom are okay but they certainly don't steal the show. Just kind of add to it. The ending is incredible and drew gasps and cheers in my theater as I'm sure it will in yours. My favorite part had to be the Kraken moments however. The action pieces set around it are just beyond words. Really well done. This one is going to be a sure hit and I'll be (or at least try to be) first in line when World's End comes out."
"captainjack1","10","0","1","8 July 2006"," Great fun, but not as good as the Black Pearl
","Before I start, I'd like to mention that I am a huge fan of both Johnny Depp and ""The Curse of the Black Pearl."" Additionally, I really did enjoy ""Dead Man's Chest,"" so even though this review seems quite harsh, I thought it was a fun film to view.<br/><br/>I think the major short-coming of this film was that it relied too much on the action. For me, the best part of The Curse of the Black Pearl were the actual exchanges between characters (Murtogg and Mullroy talking to Jack about the Black Pearl vs. Interceptor vs. the Dauntless, ""I'm disinclined to acquiesce to your request,"" etc.). DMC had few if any funny exchanges--the extent of the jokes were snappy one-liners. Johnny Depp was great with what he was given, but because his dialogue wasn't enough to reveal character, he had to rely too much on his body actions and language. I'm not saying he did a bad job AT ALL with that--for me, he was all that really made the movie cohesive at all--but I wish the writers had given him more with which to work.<br/><br/>Davy Jones wasn't a believable villain to me. I love Barbossa because he's a smooth-speaking, funny, believable evil: his character isn't pure good or pure evil but is rather a complex mixture which makes him compelling for me. I feel bad for him at times and at others I want to throttle him, and that's what makes a great villain in my opinion. Davy Jones was just sort of...meh, I guess. Why was he so generically, packaged-up villain? Why did he become such a bad person? What went wrong with him? I get his broken heart, but that doesn't merit his actions, the way I see it. Another thing about Davy Jones before I move on: both he and his crew had great CGI to be sure, but it was a little...much. With Barbossa and his crew, the CGI isn't constant; there are moments when they look completely normal, some where they have an arm or a leg that is skeletal, and still others where they are completely supernatural. To quote a local newspaper, ""you can only look at the band of bad guys...for so long."" And I agree with that. I was annoyed at their presence after a while.<br/><br/>I also didn't understand Commodore Norrington's dramatic change in character. First, what compelled him to lead a dishonorable life? He seemed pretty 'ok' with the whole Elizabeth-Will deal. What happened? Additionally, though we dislike him because he impedes the Elizabeth/Will love story, we also feel bad for him when he gives up the girl and allows her to make her own decisions. He was a good man, and I don't get why he suddenly became so self-serving.<br/><br/>I thought that the whole natives/Jack=God plot line was funny, but completely useless and could have been removed so that an actual plot could have been constructed. It seemed incredibly random.<br/><br/>Now, granted, there were a lot of great moments. I loved Jack's first entrance; I really liked his jar of dirt; I thought the whole sequence with Jack, Norrington, and Will fighting on the beach was absolutely hilarious, but overdrawn once they got to the Church. I felt that Will's character finally developed a bit in this film and that he seemed so much more competent and interesting, which was great for me. I LOVED the interactions between Elizabeth and Jack. That piece actually seemed believable to me because she doesn't want to admit that she is attracted to such a messed up excuse for a human being and tries to blame it on a broken compass.<br/><br/>Overall, I just look back on the first installment and see a complete plot that was aided by action, not molded by it. We came to love the characters because they exposed themselves to us. In this movie, all the characters were almost just 'there' and letting the action guide them through the journey. Jack wasn't nearly as competent, and many of his actions seemed completely inexplicable, even for him.<br/><br/>Now, all that being said, I really, really liked it. I was entertained. But I wanted to love it, and I just simply don't. This installment just lost so much of its charm and purpose and much of it just seemed an excuse for elaborate fighting and flashy CGI. I'm not even sure that I'm going to buy it on DVD, whereas the first one is a movie I could watch over and over again."

","Overall i thought the movie was pretty good. As for Johnny Depp, i don't think there's a character he can't play. Throughout the movie they have him doing what he does best--escaping. Most of the movie is in dark but they have some comedy in the movie to make it well. Orlando Bloom did very well as did Keira Knightly. The true star of course was Johnny Depp. They had some great fighting scenes like the one on the big wheel. Although it got alittle confusing there was great comedy acts by Johnny Depp. The plot line did get a bit confusing once in a while but over all it was a good movie. They did a very well job of making you want to come see the next one because they left you on a cliff hanger as of what's to happen to Jack Sparrow. Excuse me Captain Jack Sparrow."

","This is was my most anticipated movie of the year. It starts off a little slow but it's setting up the plot basically but when they get to the cannibal island thats where the fun picks up. The CG is amazing especially on Davy Jones and his crew, the first emergence of them and the Flying Dutchman is great. My favorite character of the film wasn't Jack Sparrow but Tia Dalma, she was great and lot of fun to watch. I came away a little disappointed with the film overall but I do love the surprise ending. At times I got into it and at times it felt really long. The scene after the credits is cute so stay all the way through the credits. The film basically sets up the third one (May 25, 2007) which after how this one ends and from the plot outline I read for ""At Worlds End"" it sounds bigger and better than ""Dead Man's Chest"" so I'm really looking forward to it. I heard Tia Dalma is in it more, I really hope she is. Early reports are that this made from $50-58 million on Friday, I hope these reports are true, even though I didn't like it as much as the first it deserves to set all the weekend records and be biggest movie of the year.

","This movie was pretty good. The rumor about there being something after the credits is true, but it's not WORTH STAYING THE EXTRA TEN MINUTES. All that happens is that the dog that was captured by the savages on the island where jack was gets crowned as their new king. I really enjoyed the scene where Will Turner meets his father bootstrap Bill on the Flying Dutchman. The action scenes were a little lame and predictable, especially when Will, Jack, and the washed-up colonel guy all pull out swords and say their cheesy lines about why they want the box with the squidface guys heart in it. Also, personally i don't care how good a movie is hyped up to be, it should never be 2.5 hours long."
"jerrythecow","8","0","1","8 July 2006"," Slow to start, then gets better. A bit confusing.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest does not really follow the first story that much. It has the same characters, but is not really a continuation. You could watch it without watching the first one.<br/><br/>In starts with Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightly)having their wedding interrupted by the small setback of them getting arrested. The charges: helping Jack Sparrow get away. They are sentenced to death. But the man in charge offers Will one chance. If he can get Jack Sparrow's compass for him, in exchange for a navy pardon, they can both go free.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is being haunted by a slave of Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), Bootstrap Bill Turner (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd), who we later learn is Will's father.<br/><br/>Through a series of events, (which I won't go into too much detail about) a four-way war starts for the possession of Davy Jones's chest. Of course every chest has it's key, and they also need that.<br/><br/>The plot is a bit confusing, with a lot of twists and turns. Very funny at a lot of parts, and well directed. All the acting was good, and the special effects were really good, from ships falling apart, to the tentacles of a kraken grabbing a ship.<br/><br/>It started out kind of slow, and I was going to give it a 7, but then it got much better. It's hard to say which is better, the first or the second, because they both had they're good parts. It ends with a huge cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more: Jack Sparrow dies, and they need to bring him back, with the help of none other then: Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) the evil ship's captain from the first movie, who supposedly died. I can't wait for the sequel! Go see this movie!"

"mr_me","7","0","2","8 July 2006"," A Very Different Pirate
","This can be compared to The Empire Strikes back, it is a lot darker, sinister and scary than the first one, and where this worked with Star Wars, I believe it is Dead Man's Chest's downfall. This is more like Matrix Reloaded than Empire Strikes Back.<br/><br/>Now I cannot stress enough that Dead Man's Chest is NOT a bad movie. It is just a very different film to the original, however, there are quite a few problems. The first being the characters. Far too many pointless characters returned from the original, and although it is nice to see them, there are no where near enough new characters for us to get to know. All of Jack's crew are those from the original, no new pirates, apart from the enemies.<br/><br/>Davey Jones is no where near as good an enemy as Barbossa, there does not seem to be much point in him, not many explanations as to why he is the way he is, he just happens to be there, and wants Captain's Jack's soul. At least Barbossa had a purpose and a goal. There are also very few scenes between Sparrow and Jones, making the whole chase seem a lot less personal.<br/><br/>There are also far too many jokes related to the original. No new material, such as a joke referring to Jack always being slapped by women, the dog with the keys and strapping sea turtles to their legs. Some new jokes would have been nice, although it is nice to be reminded of The Curse of the Black Pearl.<br/><br/>Those are the bad points, but it is still a good film. There are some amazing sequences, such as an amazing watermill based sword-fight and a hilarious chase between Captain Jack and a group of cannibals. It is a good action film, but not quite the fun fest of the original.<br/><br/>But...with an amazing ending scene, and plenty set up for the third movie, perhaps all these problems will be nearly ironed out by the end of the trilogy. Let's hope. A good film, but if this was the first film, it would not have been well received."

Before you scratch your head in confusion over why it got a 7, let me tell you.<br/><br/>+++ Captain Jack. No matter how awful the movie is, it's still Jack. + The first time I have ever seen a three-way free for all sword fight. + Norrington without his wig. Gotta love it. ++ Incredible special effects. Truly top notch. + Key-dog makes a cameo, as does the monkey (who I forgot was still cursed) + Will's turn to get slapped + The scene with Ragetti and the Bible. Loved it. + How many other people/monsters can play piano with their face? + All the lovable pirates on Jack's crew are back (except Annamaria). + Excellent camouflage work on the natives. The whole theater jumped when he popped out. + Shish-Kabob was predictable, but still humorous.<br/><br/>+/- Get to see Orlando Bloom without a shirt.<br/><br/><ul><li>Got the crews easily confused when many look alike - I didn't understand the premise of the dice game, so all the tension was lost on me. - The wheel is funny and clever, but very, very obviously impossible. - Nobody understands the cannibal language, or the jokes ingrained in it. I heard after about the ""eunichy"" and ""snip-snip"", and it still was too confusing and not very funny. - The whole cannibal island was disconnected, pointless and bizarre. - Quotes are humorous, but very few are laugh out loud. Many are repeated from Black Pearl. - A new character (a sorceress/prostitute?) is added. I think it would have worked just as well with Annamaria as that lady. - Too many subplots: and the whole one pardon thing makes little sense. -- In explanation for my title, the scene where Jack is covered with Kraken breath and all its...contents...make me completely sick. - Keira Knightley and the ghost thing was a little stupid. Even when in male clothes, it's very obvious that she's a girl (look at hair, jaw line. Her voice is nowhere near that of a man's ). - Rip off Treasure Island. - Clear by his second step down who the mystery captain was. (name was on cast list, but not yet in movie) - Cliffhanger. End of story.</li></ul><br/><br/>? How did Ragetti/Pintel get the Key-Dog? ? Does that mean that Bootstrap Bill never really died? He just sat on the bottom of the ocean for ten years until the curse was over? ? Why isn't you know who (if you saw the movie) dead? ? Why doesn't DJ have a nose? He has this little tube thing, but no nose. Octopi don't have either, so he might as well have had a nose. ? What's the deal with the music box?<br/><br/>I think it balances out somewhat. The good news is, if this is a typical Hollywood trilogy, the third won't be so bad. Just look at Rocky. The universal movie pattern is: 1. Unbelievable, incredible. 2. Pretty awful, a slime-sucker. 3. Mediocre, a mix of the two.<br/><br/>Worth a look when it comes out on DVD (ie rental), but don't pay big bucks to see it, or try to center your day around it. My heart goes out to those who paid for a midnight showing."

One of my favorite part involves the cannibals. I thought it was funny when the crew was rolling away in the balls and when captain jack became a fruit kabob trying to escape. I thought the beginning was o.k but in all a bit strange and rather confusing. I would prefer that they take out a bit from the sword fighting scenes and some from when the krakken attacks the black pearl. I want them Tia take that out and add a little bit more toward the end. I think it was a good idea but i didn't like that they ended with captain barbosa talking at Tia dalmas.

Obviously for ll the women who are concerned he looks just as fabulous as well so do not panic that they may have decreased in the 3 year long wait.<br/><br/>It is very hard to compare the two films seeing as they are so different which sounds strange seeing as it is the sequel but perhaps this is why it is so successful the plot is completely different. It could be a separate film in its own right and have done just as well. The fight scenes are tremendous, the graphics extremely accurate and the relationship between the characters highly amusing.<br/><br/>I think most women will be pretty glad when i state the only slight criticism there is with the film---the on screen chemistry between Orlando and Keira is lacking slightly, nevertheless if it were any greater it could change the overall effect of the film. so i think the decision was accurate and it also allows women of today's population to dream of marrying a pirate!"

You learn of Davey Jones's past, a little more about Jack, Bootstrap, and Norrington's past(after the first movie that is). They also hate the plot because it's so called ""Just another plot randomly made up so they can do a sequel!"" So was Spiderman2, Shrek 2 and upcoming 3 and 4, Superman Returns, all of the Tim Burton Batman's, LOTR, Harry Potter, Star Wars, etc. etc.<br/><br/>But this is good, the plot is excellent, Jack's struggle to save his soul from Davey Jones comes in a series of funny, and serious events.<br/><br/>Also Will's struggle to save Elizabeth from the gallows and free his father's soul from the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>And Norrington trying to return to the Navy... it ends up in a fight!<br/><br/>And they open up the chest when they find it and who gets it? Find out...<br/><br/>The heart of Davey Jones give anyone who wields it the power to control the sea, so Jack wants it to rule the sea so he can roam freely as a pirate, and rid of the East India Trading Co. etc. with Elizabeth at his side as his Queen.<br/><br/>Will wants to stab it to free his father's soul from Davey Jones and the Flying Dutchman.<br/><br/>Norrington in Tortuga, met Mercer Beckett's assistant and received a message that if he brings him the Compass of jack to Beckett, he'll get his job back... only in a higher rank, Admiral to the East India Trading Co.<br/><br/>So they end up fighting for the key, on Isla Cruces, NOT ISLA DE MUERTA! Sorry a guy wrote a fan fiction where the chest was on Isla De Muerta...<br/><br/>And Jack open's the chest and takes the heart... but what happen's next?<br/><br/>FIND OUT!! So the score was great, and the acting was really good, one of the best parts was the cinematography! It was good! And the choreography, and the make-up really good.

","No spoilers, don't worry!! I was extremely lucky and managed to snag tickets for the 11:20 pm showing at El Capitan in Hollywood on opening night, July 7. There is no better place to see this movie, but that's another story.<br/><br/>I loved, loved, loved the first Pirates. However, we all know that sequels almost never live up to the expectations of their ""parent."" This one completely and utterly falls into that category. The story is laborious, hard to follow (thanks to loud music overriding some key dialogue) and far, far too long.<br/><br/>But the characters we know and love are back and doing their thing, to some nice laughs and gasps. The visual effects are mostly breathtaking (although a key shot near the end just screams green screen) and the locations enviously tropical. The non-dead ships look completely authentic at all times, unlike the unfortunate cardboard-cutout Dauntless of the first movie. I am almost sure the sets for Black Pearl were the same used in the Horatio Hornblower movies ""Mutiny"" and ""Retribution."" Keira Knightly looks hot, tanned, and nothing like the porcelain doll of the first movie. She looks just like she ought to - a bit roughed up and out of sorts, which is nice for the kind of people who hate it when women in movies pop out of bed at 3am and look like they've just stepped out of a salon. Johnny Depp is babe-a-licious as always, despite the effeminance of his character. I am not sure effeminance is a word, so let me just say he is not a tenth as macho as dear, dear Orlando, who completely stole my heart in this movie. I wasn't ready for that. The guy is gorgeous, gorgeous, and more gorgeous. I went expecting to have Johnny Depp reclaim me, but the movie mostly centers around Orlando (Will Turner) and he carries it deliciously well.<br/><br/>Jack Davenport is back, but ladies, you'll be slightly disappointed at his rag-tag appearance. The guy with the wooden eye still yearns for a real one and chases his around a few times (thankfully not as often as in the first movie, which became tedious and repetitive). Stellan Skarsgaard, although hidden behind some nasty marine growth, is passionate and moving in his brief appearances. There is no mistaking that the cast, including all the new characters, was perfect.<br/><br/>Now for the bad part. The action sequences. Except for the part in the jungle in the beginning (inside the cages), I was tired of being beat over the head with ""wow look how cool this is"" stunts. Gentlemen, you needn't extend an already visually overloaded movie into one of total incoherence. There are two subsequent shots near the end that nearly sent me vomiting from vertigo (I know, tmi) and the rolling wheel thingie seemed like it would never end. There were so many spots in the movie that would have benefited from a bit of snip-snip, or perhaps just not so many quick shots jumbled together so that we can't see which end is up and who got shot where and when and by whom.<br/><br/>All in all, the action sequences involving our non-CGI characters did not seem plausible to me. They were given almost superhuman strength and endurance, which is something I would rather see in Fantastic Four II than Dead Man's Chest. The first movie managed to master realistic choreography, but this one did not. Quite unfortunate.<br/><br/>I promised to not spoil the movie, so I won't go any further. See it and judge for yourself. There are many pleasant surprises. I enjoyed it immensely but perhaps it was because I had three cups of coffee that I could stay awake all the way through it. Four people in my row in the movie theater briefly fell asleep because they could not follow the story. And these were die-hard fans who got tickets for opening night, mind you.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Would have been better if it was shorter and less action-packed.

","Where to start? Well, I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll be as vague as possible. The movie is great. Every character, from Jack to Will and even Elizabeth have all evolved with better fighting skills, worse people skills, and much wittier repartee. The new characters of Davy Jones, Tia Dalma and Cutler Beckett (Oh wait, its LORD Cutler Beckett. as he says) are excellent, as is the new version of James Norrington. And the special effects (particularly the Kraken) are the best I've seen since Star Wars III.<br/><br/>The storyline is also good, nothing is predictable, there are no gaps (except for one, the ending, but I'll get to that), and everything unfolds at just the right pace. The multiple story lines are handled so that no-one gets confused, and you know where everyone is at one time.<br/><br/>However, there are two personal problems with the movie. One, being Will's father, Bootstrap Bill. It is really hard to believe that he IS Will's father. He's occasionally weak-willed, gentle and over-protective. And he's really ugly to add a further insult.<br/><br/>And, two, the ending, I really hate cliffhangers, especially when the next movie is a year away. And there's so many things left to finish. What happened to Jack? What happened to Barbossa? To Davy Jones? To Bootstrap Bill? To Governor Swann? There's too many loose ends to remember for a year.<br/><br/>Anyways, thats the only two problems with the movie that I can see. It's a excellent movie all up, on par and even better in some ways than the prequel. See it, buy it, love it."
"austxsun","6","0","3","8 July 2006"," A Fun, Solid Sequel that doesn't hold a candle to the first film
","I've just returned from the theatre where I witnessed the heralded return of the witty Captain Jack, beautiful Lizzie Swan, and honorable Will Turner. This second installment is nonstop fun action and is loaded with great special effects.<br/><br/>The basic plot is one that does good to pull the same characters back for us to enjoy and does some at providing a further glimpse into Jack Sparrow's past by giving some background around his rise to Captainhood.<br/><br/>All that said though... I am still a little disappointed. I watched the 1st film last night to refresh my memory prior to tonight's viewing.<br/><br/>Most sequels fail to live up to the original (and with Disney's recent run, I probably should have expected even less) yet, after returning most of the cast from the first (strongly noted exception: Geoffrey Rush as Barbosa), the director in Gore Verbinski, and the same writers (from what I can tell), I let my expectations soar. My ship's sails fell a little flat... to me, it seems that much of the entertaining banter from the first flick was gone, lost in special effects and action sequences. There are undoubtedly efforts made, and even some successes, but the original really kept the dialogue fresh and clever - a smile rarely had time to vacate my face. Whereas the dialogue itself was the primary source of comedy in the original, I felt that much of that magic was replaced with action scene after action scene in which the viewer was bombarded with situational humor and with long sequences without much of a smile.<br/><br/>I don't want to sound like I'm trashing this version - it really it quite fun. Looking at it now, it's almost unfair to draw comparison's to the original but sequels do invite them. I am sure that the second viewing for me will be more pleasurable as my expectations have been re-established so that I can enjoy the film for what it is: a very fun, solid sequel lacking much of the magic of the original. It will surely live strong if only due to it's predecessor's genius. Savvy? 7/10"

","What a delight to see a film that doesn't resort to sexual pleasures or unnecessary foul language to fill space. Spontaneous belly laughs. Clever chases and fights. The story rolls continuously with twists and enough action for all pirate enthusiasts....or should I rephrase that and say ""for all Johnny Depp enthusiasts"". Once again Captain Jack Sparrow maneuvers in and out of tight spots, gets others to do his work. He hasn't changed. Thank goodness for that! <br/><br/>It was good to see characters from the first ""Pirates...."". Something comforting in that. They play so well off one another. The whole cast deserve a standing ovation for a job well done (in fact the theater audience did applaud). Loved the parrot and, of course, monkey sequences.<br/><br/>Shorter Davy Jones ship fight scenes would have worked for me. Thank goodness they weren't overly long. I was thoroughly impressed with the costuming and makeup. The detail. The movement of the tentacles. How they do that! Hope some of the tricks show up on the DVD.<br/><br/>Will not compare the first movie to the second. The stories are totally different. Both equally well done for its storyline. The ending shocked me. I couldn't believe the cliffhanger. Will definitely have to see the last installment BUT how can I wait a whole year!!!! That is the cruelty of the trilogy, the wait!"
"basecotcenter","8","0","1","7 July 2006"," The Bad
","First off...I loved this movie. Loved it. It had everything I expected and then some. Evoking Errol Flynn and even a dash of good old Raiders of the Lost Ark. There were 4 things that kept this film from being as good as the original:<br/><br/>1. The Curse of the Confused Narrative Some guy wants Jack's compass or it's curtains for Elizabeth, then the same guy REALLY wants the chest; Governor Swan hates Will turner suddenly for no logical reason and will stop at nothing to pluck his daughter out of the hole she's in; Jack wants the key to the chest for some purpose that is never clearly defined (probably involving his blood debt, but this is never really explained), Davey Jones wants Jack Sparrow, then 1,000 souls, then Jack Sparrow again, Will wants Elizabeth, then the key, then his dad, then the key again, and Elizabeth wants Will and the key. In the middle of all this, it seems the crew of the pearl decided (why not?) to get captured by some aborginies for no good reason. In other words, there is WAY too much going on in this film plotwise compared to the first one. Not that complexity is necessarily a bad thing, but it is when handled so sloppily; one hopes that the third installment will clear up some of the muddle. Thankfully, by the 1/2 hour mark the characters manage to FINALLY hammer down exactly what the hell is going on. Whew.<br/><br/>2. The Curse of the Flailing Mega-star Don't get me wrong. Mr.Depp is amazing, everyone breathing knows that. His tears cure cancer, he poops golden turds, etc. It seemed to me that at certain times the film would have been more appropriate with the Benny Hill theme song playing instead of the soundtrack.<br/><br/>3. The Curse of the Incessant Self-Referencing The whole self-awareness in-joke gagfest thing was cool to me when I was 12. The big 1-3 rolled around and I was pretty much over it as far as sequels are concerned. I hate it when a film is practically SHOUTING at me and poking me, saying ""hey, hey! member that from the first film? 'member? wasn't that AWESOME when that happened in the first film?"" Yeah, it was. That's why I own the collector's edish DVD...I HAVE the first movie already. The worst example of this is Gov.Swan's yuk-yuk line, ""Where's that dog with the keys?"". The dog thing is referenced AGAIN when Elizabeth is in the jail cell, and AGAIN when the dog is on the rowboat with the two characters I affectionately refer to as R2-D2 and C-3P0. Thankfully this self-referencing groan-fest is toned down to a dull roar by the 1/2 hour mark, and the few remaining instances (""pirate!"" on the black pearl at the end being a good example) are done in EXCELLENT taste.<br/><br/>4. The Curse of the Missing Xbox Certain Kraken scenes and certain squishy-nasty-barnacle-encrusted pirates scenes had me wondering if I could perhaps plug in my Xbox controller and play a round of whatever video game I was watching. Isn't there a starving, out of work special effects props/costume man out there who'd, like, do a movie like this for free? Just so us, Mr. and Mrs. Joe Public, would be spared ONE more gratuitous CGI circus standing in for special effects?"

","Well I saw POTC 2, i enjoyed it. The movie was not as good as the first, but as we all know, the first movie is something very hard to work to be as good as or even better. It was a long movie, more than 2 hours. I enjoy cliffhangers, we do know that Johnny Depp is not dead though. Johnny Depp was wonderful, as usual, doing his stunts and making the watchers laugh. He has that special charm in him, the way he uses his body, not just words, and face expressions to make the viewers laugh. I also enjoyed the whole part of Johnny and Keira. From the very beginning there was 'chemistry' between them, but they never showed it. Even at the end of the first movie where he says: it would have never worked between us darling'. Johnny is this adventureous, dangerous character, and Orlando is this forever sweet and good character. Keira wants some adventure and a challenge in her life, which Johnny could provide. They left us wanting more and now we are all waiting for the 3rd movie to come out and show us what happens to Jack, and what Will has to say after seeing Keira kiss Johnny. Go watch it, it was a thriller and you are kept on your feet the entire movie."
"punkerbrat8086","8","0","4","7 July 2006"," Epic but unsettling...
","While the plot was very intriguing and the characters were definitely complex and interesting I found certain aspects of the movie unsettling. The end was a major cliff hanger which left me and my friends feeling slightly short changed and unsure of how to react. We simply thought the movies should stand on their own and not depend on the fact that there will be a sequel, although I am definitely looking forward to the next film.<br/><br/>However, they managed to add new depth to the characters of Elizabeth Swan, Will Turner, Norrington and of course Jack Sparrow. Davy Jones was a wonderfully imaginative character capable of a darkness that was difficult to foresee in a Disney film.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie unless you don't like unfinished endings that leave you feeling slightly anxious."
"martinusher","8","0","2","7 July 2006"," Not great art but excellent entertainment
","I didn't go to see this movie to be enlightened by great art. Its not that kind of picture. Its designed primarily to entertain and to extend the ""Pirates"" franchise, and it succeeds brilliantly at this.<br/><br/>You can see elements of theme park rides and video games in the plot, a plot that's structured more like the levels of a game than the chapters of a book. This results in the only negative comment I can make about the movie -- it runs a bit long as the plot is continually stretched to fit around the action sequences. (The movie also has a definite ""to be continued"" feel about its ending -- but then what would you expect?) So don't expect an uplifting intellectual experience, plan to overlook the historical and technical inaccuracies, ignore the overused clichÃ©s (not English villains *again*!) and sit back and enjoy the ride. And don't forget to bring the kids."

","Pirates of the Caribbean, dead man's chest was not quite what I was hoping for. Some may say the first was better by far. I wonder, was it really the peter Jackson leave you hanging with too many questions floating about ending that Verbinski was really going for. Truthfully I left the movie theater slightly outraged. How much longer now must I wait for the 3rd movie? The ending left me clapping and yet screaming at the same time. It was like when the screen went black, i felt as though i needed to stand up and put the new disk in. The casting for this film and such were terrific. But I also feel that perhaps there was too many plots running at once. And how on earth is Barbosa still alive? That shocking ender to the film just created more questions in my mind. I think that the plot lines could have been a bit more explained, but of course I shall be one of those fans who will line up at midnight to see the next one."
"Lark_Pash","7","0","2","7 July 2006"," Pretty Good
","I thought this movie was definitely a good one to see in theaters. However, some of it did disappoint me. Usually sequels never live up to the original, but this one got pretty darn close! I liked it, but found myself and entire family getting exhausted during it. It got really slow in some parts.<br/><br/>I love the unexpected twists it gave in this one. But, it almost lost its ""pirate"" feel. It gained on a scifi feel instead of the pirate one. I felt like I was watching a science fiction flick my dad would go to theaters and watch. It was quite creative, but I think they tried too hard on this movie.<br/><br/>I was really against some of the character's actions. Elizabeth's attempt to chain Jack Sparrow to the Black Pearl and leave him for the Crackin was...in my opinion..SO uncalled for! The nerve of that girl! Then in the end of the movie, they of course brought back Captain Barbosa which seems annoying, but I think the idea is kind of cool besides he gets to eat that apple he was planning on eating when he was shot in the first movie.<br/><br/>Things I liked: The action was unbelievable! The special effects will probably get some sort of award! The costumes, the way all the fish people looked was wonderfully amazing. The characters stayed true to their original personality and some of the old humor was still in this movie.<br/><br/>Dislikes: Jack Sparrow was portrayed more as a dirt-bag than a wild and daring pirate. It was drawn out. There was so much crammed in this moving, it was hard to follow. There was the Commadore who was now a drunk fighting Jack, who was fighting Will, who was fighting Davy Jones and so on. It was like it never would end. Oh, and don't forget the crazy natives that wanted to sacrifice Jack in the beginning and they even managed to jab Will's sad father in who is being slaved by Daby Jones.<br/><br/>Overall, pretty good. same ole characters and enjoyable, but a sequel is a sequel and nothing seems to ever live up to the first (but like I mentioned, this one got AWFULLY close)"

","So I went into this movie with all the expectations in the world! Let me just tell you, not many of them were filled. Is it just me or did the movie seem choppy? It went form scene to scene to story after story. I could hardly keep up with what was going on. I mean there was Norringtons story, William Turners story, Elizabeth, Jack, etc. It was like watching a whole bunch of different movies. And to me it seemed liked all the characters had gone through a change. The beautiful Elizabeth was now a swash buckling pirate kissing every man she gets her hands on and Will was no longer the tough yet gentle loving pirate.. he was just a pirate, and Jack I don't know I think Johnny threw a little to much Willy Wonka in to him. And then Jack died! Not cool. I can honestly say I did enjoy myself but was a little upset with the movie as a whole. Don't get me wrong it was funny but is that enough.

"liz-hillyer","8","0","1","7 July 2006"," Pirates take 2
","Pirates begins well as seems more dark then the previous film however the first half hour seems to consist of the funny likable parts from the first film. for example there are remarks about the rum being gone, hilarious the first time but should probably have not been repeated as it seems to take away the uniqueness of the film. Also it seems to have taken a star wars theme of the meeting between Will and his father. This is an unforgivable offence that should not happen in films! Especially in this film as it will become a classic. Anyone with half a brain could see that they would bring back his father, possibly not in quite the way they did but never the less, so they should have tried to create a more imaginative character. Everything He does is too predictable and obvious although you may not think so at the time after you have seen the film you can tell that it has certain links to other films. One of them being star wars as I have said; evil father attempts to save his son by giving up his own life. But other then these small flaws and they are only small in comparison, the film is excellent and although I may not go as far as to say it is as good as the first one it definitely rivals all the films released recently at the cinema. It is definitely one to watch."
"hink823","8","0","1","7 July 2006"," keep watching it gets better
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is by my standards a pretty good movie. However, it just doesn't quite live up to the first one. I think that most people who see it would agree that the first hour moves too fast and can become confusing. The turning point where the movie begins to get back to what made the first film so great is when Will(Bloom) is pressed into Davy Jones'(Nighy) crew and Cptn. Sparrow (Depp)arrives in Tortuga. From here the story slows down in pace and becomes more enjoyable as you are now given some time to comprehend what is happening. The final part of this movie is perhaps the most fun to watch as it brings up several questions that will have to be resolved in the third movie. One character that I missed from the first movie was Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) who added a sort of fiendish wit to the film. I was pleasantly surprised when Barbossa is brought back at the end of the film (you'll see it coming if you pay attention during the first part involving Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris)). Overall this movie is good and is definitely worth seeing."

","Well, actually to be fair they were right about some things. This movie definitely could've done with losing quite some stuff towards the middle that dragged on a bit and sometimes the plot got a bit muddled up. Also there were a lot of times when the film makers recycled jokes from the first film just to try and get a few more laughs out of them. I wouldn't have minded so much if they had restrained themselves a bit but there's only so many times you can joke about rum before it gets old. And they definitely could've improved the ending: I'm fully aware that things will be explained in the third film but all the same the plot twist felt a bit forced.<br/><br/>However all that said the good aspects of this film more then outweigh the bad ones. For me the highlight of the film was definitely the Kracken: it was amazing! I'd go so far as to say it was the best movie monster I've ever seen! And the action scenes were especially well done (like the three way sword fight on the run-a-way water wheel). It was a film you could just lose yourself in and just purely enjoy (even if it did get a bit dark on times).<br/><br/>And even if you don't enjoy the story or the acting then you can just lose yourself in the wonderful sets and fantastic effects. All in all it was a pretty great film, not quite on the level of the first one admitadly but certainly a worthy (if flawed) sequel"
"corleonedude","8","0","1","7 July 2006"," Adventure, Action, Comedy, Fantasy, Johnny Depp, what more do you need?
","Summer blockbusters are made for pure entertainment. And over the years Hollywood has learned that entertainment can originate from a lot of different elements, visual spectacles, big name celebrities, romance, unique and unforgettable characters, comedies, action, or sometimes just a plain good story that doesn't need any other polishing to make it fantastic. It's like mixing a cocktail with different ingredients. Yet no one likes to drink the same cocktail over and over again so the difficulty is to put in the same ingredients only to create something that is better than the first glass. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest is probably the only movie that achieved such goal so far in this summer race.<br/><br/>Not only does it have all of the elements above, it also succeeds in lifting the whole scale and expectation of adventure genre to a brand new level. And at the same time, not straying from the tone of the first one that everyone had enjoyed. It is something more than an extension, it made the audience felt like the first movie was merely a tip of the iceberg, that there's way more that's underneath and so many territories worthy of exploring creatively.<br/><br/>Johnny Depp's crowd-pleasing, original take of CAPTAIN Jack Sparrow is at it's best here, successfully bringing the character to the very core of the movie. Orlando Bloom's Will and Keira Knightley's Elizabeth is unforgettable. The supporting casts of pirates each have their own purposes and bounce off very well against one another. Bill Nighy's Davy Jones is a villain with soul and CGI only made the character more convincing. Something I haven't approved of CGI ever since Gollum from LOTR.<br/><br/>I won't go into the story because you can't really explain it without spoilers but let's just say it doesn't wait for you to think because there's so much going on at once. It's usually confusing for the audience when there's a lot of strings to tie in three hours yet they manage to pull it together alright. Each character is there for a purpose and they don't waste time. It's hard nowadays to see that in summer blockbuster. The ending amplifies the anticipation it had build up for the third movie while the audience were enjoying this one. <br/><br/>However it is still a continuation of POTC1, so it's best if you're familiar with the first one to enjoy every minute of this sequel. Overall it's not only best summer blockbuster I've seen so far, it's also the best movie that lived up to my expectation this year."

","I was a huge fan of the 1st Pirates and I couldn't wait for this one to come out. And let me tell you, it does not disappoint. It is not as good as the original, but it was still very high up there. The visual effects are the best that I have ever seen and the original's pale to the sequels. Davy Jones is one of the greatest special effects I have ever seen. Just how real the flying Dutchmen were left me in AWE.<br/><br/>THe biggest difference between this movie and the 1st is that it is so much darker. There's a lot more blood and people getting their throats slashed, and the Kraken killing many people. Depp is still Depp and thats why the movie is so great. Although the 1st 20 minutes of the film are a little slow, the pace picks up and film ends up being a 2 1/2 hr thrill ride. The scale of this movie crushes the original, but with a budget of 225 million compared to the original's 145, how could it not. In the end this film is still a great movie that I will see many times, but I cannot compare it to the original. The two have the same exact cast, but the films still feel different. Don't get me wrong, the film was excellent but the core of the film is very different and there are way to many different characters and their story lines.

","On the whole a really good movie, plenty of action with giggles and gut laughs mixed in, I'd recommend it to anyone. It was true to the slash-stab-laugh formula of the first Pirates of the Caribbean and it's much better than some of the other Hollywood junk that's come out recently. However, at times it feels that they are trying really really hard to make you laugh about the ridiculousness of Jack, and his bumbling crew. And whereas the first movie could be more or less placed in a historical context this one is definitely moving towards the fantasy side of things. In the first, as long as you could swallow the idea of the Aztec gold then the most absurd thing was the ghost crew. This one... well you've seen the posters of Davy Jones aka Octopus-face... yeah the rest of his crew is like that too. Oh and if you're going because you like gnarly pirates then you're probably going to be disappointed. However, those minor objections aside I really enjoyed it and you probably will too."
"evildeadguy57","8","0","1","7 July 2006"," Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of Rum!
","So the verdict is.....an exceptional film.<br/><br/>The movie flowed really well, despite the length, which is again close 2 and 1/2 hours and could have probably been tightened up. However, despite that, it was stunning. The visuals looked spot on, the spirit of the first film was kept alive, and the introduction of Davy Jones is a gem to the film.<br/><br/>As with the first, I was blown away, and ready to see this film again. I did have my gripes though, as will others. I still think that in the overall story, the First POTC is better. It's a given. Dead Man's Chest does indeed have more action, but it lacks the tightness of the first movie's plot. Though another spectacular, yet more eccentric performance by Depp, whose Jack Sparrow is one of the main reasons for these movies being as good as they are, Elizabeth's character seems flawed, or the creators of the film might be taking a different direction than anticipated with her. Not going to spoil it, but when you see it, you'll know what I mean, and question: What the hell?<br/><br/>Though the plot was slightly weak, some of the dialogue a little sloppy overall, the movie is definitely a popcorn flick. It's funny that every time I see either of these POTC movies, I am in awe, and despite the shortcomings of greatness that there could be in them, I don't really care because of how fun they are to watch. And, to add to that enjoyment is Davy Jones, who honestly made the film for me. After seeing Dead Man's Chest, I again had the time of my life.<br/><br/>So...rope up a couple sea-turtles lads, strap your boots on, and go see Dead Man's Chest. You won't regret it. Argh!"

","Yes, 'tis true. The long-awaited sequel is pointless with a very difficult, hard-to-follow plot. Characters keep appearing, disappearing then reappearing again, randomers are flying left, right and centre and Keira Knightley is one of the most annoying women ever. She tries to act manly in a sexy way which doesn't work and is just embarrassing. Johnny Depp does keep Captain Jack Sparrow up to his usual standard but the script lacks many of the brilliant one-liners that made the first film so great. Orlando Bloom has improved though, Will Turner is a more believable character and his acting has improved. Bill Nighy is brilliant as Davy Jones but it's not actually explained who he is, why he has a squid as a head and why Jack Sparrow is in debt to him. The many sword fights are entertaining, but I still feel Jack wasn't as brilliant as he was in the first movie, there was just something lacking which i feel was more the script's fault than Johnny Depp's. Going back to the plot, it was be impossible to follow if it wasn't for Gibbs giving a running commentary throughout which helps a lot and is a touch of genius form the writers. I don't think Davy Jones is as good a baddie as Barbossa, who just seemed that slightly more ruthless. And the guy who plays Cutler Beckett is so annoying (but then again, you're not meant to like him) Go and see the film just to say you've seen it, but don't expect the humorous one-liners from Jack, the riding of the seven seas or anything that will explain what the heck is going on."

Because of this though, it can be kind of slimy. There are so many twists and turns in this adventure it has everything! Comedy, Suspense, Action! Just a warning on the end though, it is totally a set up for the third one (like a lot of films). The whole audience groaned when the movie ended.

"EddyChadwick","8","0","1","7 July 2006"," How To Make A Sequel
","Firstly i would just like to say that this is one of the most original sequels ever made and in some ways easily beats the first film. What makes the first film great is carried on and placed into this film without taking on exactly the same form as in the first film. Again we have one hell of a performance put in by Johnny Depp as the surely liver-troubled Captain Jack Sparrow, this performance is undoubtedly keeps the film going although i am definitely not degrading the performances by the other two main characters and the supporting cast but we know who steals the lime light. The comedy used in the film is also included in the action sequences and had me and my two friends laughing at it and as a 16 year old watching what is supposedly a child's film it just proves that they have done a great job. The storyline and the ultimate twist in the tale all added up to give one climatic ending and set up the installment for the third film with brilliance. If you have read this all the way through you will see that i have nothing but praise for this film except one tiny little thing that got to me: Orlando Bloom is not cut out to be a comedian and i felt that some of his more comic lines were wooden and although got a few laughs where definitely not as well delivered as even Kiera Knightly's but apart from that i have nothing but respect for the makers of this film as they have in no way brought down the original and they may even have just raised the bar."
"CorsetH8er","Null","0","4","7 July 2006"," Amazing but not a sequel
","This movie is not the happy go lucky tale you saw in the first one. There is hinted character death and a sexy love triangle that could prove disastrous for will/Elizabeth shippers. But on a whole it was an excellent film. There is a new side to Jack Sparrow which will be fully explored in the 3rd and final (most likely) film.<br/><br/>This film is much more realistic in the sense of the characters finally facing the consequences of their action i.e. freeing Sparrow. It is filled with plenty of thing to ponder. One must keep in mind that a third film is in the works so do not be overly dismayed by the sudden ending. Gore and Jerry haven't let us down before.<br/><br/>Stay till the end of the credits *Wink wink*"
"gawow","8","0","2","7 July 2006"," Good Movie - I am ready for number 3
","Just got in from the midnight showing - it was a packed theater of course! At least half the audience were dressed as Pirates! <br/><br/>The movie was good - very good - but not as good as the first. The effects, as expected, were awesome, especially Davey Jones and his crew. And Johnny Depp re prised the role of Jack Sparrow with perfection. <br/><br/>Unlike the first POC - Dead Mans Chest starts out fairly slow - but it does build and by about 45 minutes into the 2 1/2 hour movie it is gets fun and exciting! I kind of equate this movie to the 2nd film in the Lord of the Rings trilogy... Was a good movie - not as good as the first - BUT - is a GREAT transition for the third and you leave hungery for the 3rd to be released! With the ending scene of this movie I know I heard at least 75% of the audience shout ""COOL!"" Bottom line - if you liked the first - you will like this one and if you plan on seeing the third you really have to see this one. I would say this is yet another huge hit for Disney and the POC craze shall continue!<br/><br/>Go see it - enjoy - well worth the time and money and a lot of fun to see with a packed audience!"

","the whole movie was filled with a lot of action,<br/><br/>which is always a good thing. towards the end i must admit,<br/><br/>the makers seemed to have drawn out bits and pieces that didn't need to be.<br/><br/>the final minutes of the movie how ever left me in a state of shock,<br/><br/>and loathing at the same time. nothing could have prepared me for what the ending had in store.<br/><br/>now leading on the the third movie, i cant wait wait until it is finished and i wanna strangle something because i have to wait o damn long"
"ytrip7","8","0","1","6 July 2006"," Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is the guy who bargains and negotiates. This time around, he owes something to Davy Jones (Bill Nighy)... his soul. Jack (Captain, Jack Sparrow) tries to find a way to get out of his debt... even putting people who trust him in the hands of the sea. Davy Jones gives Captain Jack a choice: Jack's soul or 100 souls to find in three days to hand over to Davy Jones for an eternity of suffering.<br/><br/>As you would all expect, this was very entertaining... it didn't even feel like its 150 minutes. The CGI was so life-like it made me forget that the horrifying appearance of Davy Jones and his crew weren't real.<br/><br/>This sequel, to me, didn't seem like it connected with the first one and, by the end of this movie, they just opened up more questions to be answered and future adventures to be completed. If your looking for not-so-quick entertainment with familiar faces, romance, comedy, adventure, even a thriller, then this is perfect for you."
"Lady-of-Rohan","Null","0","2","6 July 2006"," A great ride but with flashes of disappointing deja vu.
","""Dead Man's Chest"" is one of my most anticipated films of the year. Ever since I saw the first one on a hot July day in 03, I was completely blown away. Well, three years later, ""POTC: Dead Man's Chest"" has finally arrived into the hungry hands of pirate fans worldwide.<br/><br/>To start off, ""Dead Man's Chest"" stars all of the familiar faces we all know and love from the first installment. Orlando Bloom, Kiera Knightly, Jack Davenport, and all the rest are back in their usual roles. Johnny Depp, as the hilarious Captain Jack Sparrow, is once again comic dynamite and captures the audiences imagination brilliantly (by the way, he once again has a great entrance). Some of Johnny's best scenes involve him escaping in some way and because of that, the audience I was with was constantly laughing. <br/><br/>For those who enjoyed the quirkiness of ""Curse of the Black Pearl"", you'll definitely appreciate the ""non-serious"" feel of this film. In fact, ""Dead Man's Chest"" takes itself even less seriously than it predecessor. This is due to the over the top stunts, slap-stick comedy, and a plot which is even more supernatural than before. <br/><br/>One of the problems that ""Dead Man's Chest"" has is that it recycles a lot of the jokes from the first film. Thus, this installment feels like a bit of a retread, despite the fact that this film features an entirely different plot. The ending is a major cliffhanger and definitely builds immense excitement for the third film. ""Dead Man's Chest"" purposely answered little questions about the plot (much to the frustration of the audience). Because it didn't answer a lot of questions, I'm not entirely raving this film. I'm well aware there is a third film after this but during a two and a half hour movie, audience's want answers to some of the burning questions in the plot. ""Dead Man's Chest"" is silent on this issue. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Dead Man's Chest"" is an enjoyable, and decent romp but is a bit too over-the-top for it's own good. In my opinion, I preferred it's predecessor where the plot was much simpler and the laughs wonderfully original. If your a fan of Johnny Depp or Pirates, this is naturally a must see. I'm just not sure if it's entirely worth a second viewing at the theatre. <br/><br/>7/10"
"adhyani1993","7","0","2","6 July 2006"," It was good.
","Sequels are rarely as good as the original, although there are exceptions to that. But who can resist Johnny Depp strutting the decks of the Black Pearl as Captain Jack Sparrow in the new Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. If you have to be picky, I think Orlando Bloom is actually quite ordinary and Keira Knightly doesn't really have all that much to do. There's so much else going on.<br/><br/>And on it goes. It's 2 and a half hours long and you do come to a point where you think there can be too much of a good thing. Hollywood produces so much lazy rubbish, and at least they've put enormous effort into delivering in terms of script and in terms of special effects and creations. You're just leaping from one crisis situation to the next, with gorgeous characters."
"movie_mad01","8","0","2","6 July 2006"," and a bottle of rum
","Pirates of the Caribbean is a movie worth the wait. It was funny as hell and once again Johnny Depp was magnificent in it. I am a big fan of this movie and advise every one o go see it. Although it dose have a twist in the end that will leads in to the 3rd movie it is full of action, drama and comedy. Really its just the ending that brings it down. look out for hidden secrets that will help with the 3rd movie. Bravo to the movie people you haven't let us down but PLEASE hurry up with the 3rd. And remember to watch the end of the credits, because there is an exclusive clip in the end. So in consolation if you like the first movie then ship off and see this one, and if you didn't well then don't see this movie. may there be rum on the ship and wind in your sails."
"fpoetx","8","0","1","6 July 2006"," Excellent movie, becomes a fascinating one if have (re)seen the first one recently!
","This fascinating movie has some excellent special effects that are extremely enjoyable and a plot that constantly keeps the interest high. What I would suggest to increase the thrill, is that one should see the 2003 movie again before going for the sequel since some information is very useful to understand some features of the plot. I had some difficulty recalling some of the incidences and following the plot, since I haven't seen the first one (equally fascinating) for quite a while. The characters and their relationships are clearly presented in the first one and some of them are considered 'given' for the second one. Now I plan to watch them both again, to enjoy them more!! I am looking forward to the third one."
"xcandystickaddictx","9","0","2","6 July 2006"," This year's summer hit!!! Savvy???
","After weeks of waiting the film everyone has been talking about this year finally arrived to the British screens. I was so excited about seeing this film after being such an avid fan of the first one. The first film proved an unexpected success throughout the world, but I'm not as sure.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong i thought the film was great; there aren't many films that can survive a sequel and i feel this one has. However i did feel that the storyline was far too complex especially as it's being aimed at children. It took a while for me to truly understand properly what was going on whilst catching up with all the characters. There are several plots going on; Will and Elizabeth's wedding, the arrival of a lord wishing to rid the world of pirates, the fate of Jack Sparrow's soul and the unforgettable love triangle. I thought Jack Davenport's return as the devilish Commodor Norrington was rather disappointing; a wasted character and precious screen time. But some characters were worth their weight in gold, the appearance of a much loved character! My jaw dropped when i saw this character at the end of the film, if you haven't read the spoiler you will be thoroughly surprised. I thought it was an excellent twist, but sadly we will have to wait until next year to find out what becomes of it.<br/><br/>Despite these few critical comments there was much to be loved. The special effects of the sea monster and Davy Jones were brilliant. There are plenty of the much loved Jack moments and comments in the film that keep you laughing right until the end. We see some further developments of the characters; we hear more of Jack's past and even get a surprise appearance from Will's father! For those who haven't seen the first film there's no excuse. Everything is explained with helpful reminders from the first film.<br/><br/>If you are a dedicated fan of this film then i suggest you wait until the end of the film past the credits for another small clip.<br/><br/>Another brilliant swashbuckling movie that i anticipate will be another cult hit this year. So get your skates on and roll down to your nearest cinema it will be worth all that exercise! It's so good i'm off to see it again for a second time!"
"revten","8","0","2","6 July 2006"," Fast Pacing and good humor make this a worthy sequel
","Lets start with the base material. I always thought that Pirates of the Caribbean was a lame ride, even when i was a little kid. I've been really leary of Disney Movies given their ability to make family friendly schlock that typically wastes my time. So imagine my surprise when i see a real Gem of film like the first pirates of the Caribbean movie. It didn't bow down to being another Disney Film, and was perfect for it.<br/><br/>This one does not fail to disappoint either. The humor is in all the right places, and the visuals are phenomenal. Davy Jones' face animation alone is worthy of an Oscar. Some people may be thrown off of the two and a half hour run time, having just sat thru the end of 'Superman Returns' drawn out ending, but Pirates starts fast and never lets up. Definitely make sure to go to the bathroom before and hold it in.<br/><br/>As this is part of a trilogy, expect some prefacing for the next movie, and expect a downer ending similar to The Emire Strikes Back. Its a little confusing, but hopefully the third will have a great explanation.<br/><br/>And yes, there is something at the end of the credits, but before you annoy all the ushers like me who just want to get their job done, realize that you will have to sit through four minutes of credits to see TEN SECONDS of film that, although funny, you already envisioned in your head."
"mark5bardias5","7","0","3","6 July 2006"," The Pirates and Elizabeth have come back!
","All the actors put in fine displays. Yet I thought the script was a bit cheesy, even for this film, and some of the sequences were far too over the top. And Orlando Bloom put in another wooden performance, though I believe his acting was better than other times I have seen him on the big screen.<br/><br/>Jon Depp was great as usual as was Keira Knightly who just gets better and better. The confusing thing for me is who does Elizabeth Swann like? Jack or Will? Because all through the film I couldn't decide.<br/><br/>The action sequences were on the whole very well done, and the humour all the way through the film made it easily watchable.<br/><br/>As pace and action go the film was well directed and when it finishes you'll already be counting down the clock for the third film! And if you wait long enough... right through the closing credits, there's a very short scene at the end just like there was in the first film.<br/><br/>Well done Mr Verbinski because after I had seen 'The Weather Man' I was slightly worried. But you don't need to be. Fans will love it. Just don't go into the film expecting realism. It is fun fantasy adventure! Enjoy!"
