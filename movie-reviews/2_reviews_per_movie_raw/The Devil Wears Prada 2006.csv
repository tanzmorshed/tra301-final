"classicalsteve","8","59","73","4 October 2009"," Move Over Henry VIII, Louis XIV, and Napoleon: Mirander Priestly is Here -- Realistic Exposé of the Feudal-like Realm of the Madison Ave Fashion Scene
","We in the United States like to believe that we reside in a country without royalty and nobility. The only people who think that there is true egalitarianism have never worked in the Entertainment and Media Industries. There is an aristocratic elite, no question, and it is not exactly made up of politicians (although there are some). It is largely composed of those who control media, particularly in television, film, radio, music, fashion, and print. They control what get's seen and what doesn't. When these people put on huge events that involve the press, cameras, and limousines, the public comes out to pay unquestioned homage to these elites, often on the sideline behind a barricade. With cameras flashing, these people are treated like the royalty of the 17th and 18th centuries. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" examines what is like to be in the inner circle of one of these elites.<br/><br/>In addition to the public's clamoring to glimpse these powerful elites, another segment of the population desires to become one of these people by trying to ""break into"" the media business. Since there are many more people who dream of being in these circles than there are spots available, this gives enormous power to those already on the inside, particularly those who have sway to either make or break an up-and-coming career. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" chronicles an aspiring journalist who lands a dream job that, she is told, ""thousands would kill for"": being the personal assistant to the editor of one of the largest fashion magazines, Runway, whose editor-in-chief makes Bill Gates seem like a softy. The character, Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep in a tour-de-force Oscar-nominated performance) is in fact modeled after real-life Vogue Magazine editor Anna Wintour whose chilling detachment from those around her, her ability to make or break fashion careers, and her cut-throat demands on her staff have become legendary throughout the fashion world.<br/><br/>In the film, the corporation that is ""Runway"" is no democracy. It is feudalism, with Mirander the absolute queen ruling over her dominion of serfs who constantly scatter about trying to please her. The central character, Andy Sachs, is plunged into this Madison Avenue purgatory without knowing the rules of the game. A journalism-major from Northwestern, Andy knows next to nothing about the fashion world, but it's not just the fashion world--it's the world of the elite in New York. Since everyone wants to gain favor from the higher-ups in order to step up the ladder, there's often over-the-top deference to those in elite positions. I half-expected her female assistants to curtsy when Mirander entered the office. Mirander knows perfectly-well her status and she uses it, often flaunts it, to her advantage. Her staff run around like castle servants anticipating the arrival of the Lady of the Manor.<br/><br/>Streep is magnificent as her voice never reaches past mezzo-piano. When one of her staff has transgressed, or simply cannot fulfill her expectation (I doubt Superman could hold a job there), in the softest tone possible she expresses her disappointment. And yet, the anticipation of her negative reaction is what makes for moments of anti-gravitational intensity. Of course, she never compliments anyone when they've done well. Excellent performance is taken for granted in this kingdom. I've never found the raging tyrant frightening. Rather, it is the even-tempered soft-spoken empress with absolute power who sends anyone who to displeases her to the block with a disinterested wave of the figure that is the most terrifying.<br/><br/>At one point in the film, Andy chuckles when Miranda fusses over some seemingly identical-looking belts which of course spawns a lecture about how Andy's current wardrobe was in fact created by the fashion elite. This does point to another side of the fashion facade which I think may be the point of the film. If you take away the cameras, the celebrities, the allure, the models posing in museums wearing the latest by Christian Dior, at the end of the day all this is about is just jackets, belts, purses, skirts, dresses, and pants. I think one of the characters says as much. These clothes may look wonderful, even stunning, but that's all they are. They are lifeless pieces of fabric cut in a certain way to make the wearer look appealing but that's all it is. The fashion industry of course needs to perpetuate the idea that clothing is much more than clothing: that beautiful fashions will create fairy-tale existences for the purchasers. They are meant to represent a life of luxury and splendor and the purchase of these articles will bring you closer to that reality. When it doesn't, you need to buy more of these clothes. And you need to read Runway (aka Vogue) to tell you what you should buy. Of course, the only ones who actually have these fairy tale existences are the ones providing the clothes. Most of the people buying these fashions are still behind the barricade. Is there an irony here?"
"Fred-S","9","89","117","5 March 2007"," Much better than I had been led to believe
","I had been told that Merryl Streep is great in this movie but the movie isn't really very good, so I went in with very low expectations. Maybe that was good: I really liked ""The Devil Wears Prada"" a lot.<br/><br/>Maybe I liked it because of two things I had in common with Andy: first, I have had the experience of starting a new job with only the vaguest idea of what I was supposed to do (and how to do it) and finding that everyone expected me to perform competently, without any training or help, right away. Second, I have had a boss (female) who was so difficult to please and so willing to tell her underlings how stupid they were that several quit without even waiting until they could find other jobs. In other words, I could really relate to Andy's situation. Stuff like that actually does happen in the real world. Perhaps, that is the reason that I was possibly the only person in the theater who was hoping Andy would not make the choice she made.<br/><br/>One thing that Miranda Priestley (Merryl Streep) had going that my Boss From Hell did not was class. It would have been very easy to create Miranda as a monster, but, wisely and skillfully, Merryl Streep allowed her to have a dignity and intelligence that made her seem to be demanding but not sadistic.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci is superb as Nigel, the ambitious, hard working man who dreams of having a position of power like Miranda's some day.<br/><br/>""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a very funny movie that is not as far divorced from the real world as, I believe, the producers of this movie may have thought."
"borromeot","7","140","192","13 July 2007"," Meryl Streep, A Character Actress As Star
","Unmissable for Meryl Streep fans. She plays second fiddle to Anne Hathaway here - screen time wise, otherwise she's the whole bloody orchestra. She's the one reason to see the film and that in itself is one hell of a reason. Meryl Streep is fearless and part of the joy of going to see her films is that we know for a fact that she's going to dare and dare and dare. From Sophie's Choice and A Cry in The Dark to Death Becomes Her and Plenty. Here the story is as unbearable as most TV commercials but she, Meryl/Miranda transforms it into something else. We connect with her evil queen because her evil queen is much more real, much more human than anybody else on the screen. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are fun but they're in the periphery of a story that's so wafer thing they can't really move to the center. Anne Hathaway is kind of invisible and her character only changes costumes and make up. There is no real tangible growth. Now that I got that out of my system. Go see Meryl be Miranda. You'll have a lot of fun."
"EUyeshima","8","69","104","3 July 2006"," Magnificent Meryl Completely Elevates a Sharp Look at the World of Predatory Fashionistas
","Even though she portrayed variations of the same demonic character in 1989's ""She-Devil"" and 1992's ""Death Becomes Her"", Meryl Streep truly nails it in this smart, creative 2006 comedy by underplaying the role and saving her verbal talons for pivotal moments. As Miranda Priestly, the despotic editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, Streep simply singes the screen every time she appears with her perfectly upswept hair; arrogant couture opinions and frequently unreasonable demands on her staff.<br/><br/>Fortunately, director David Frankel has come along well since his 1995 Woody Allen knockoff, the irritatingly unctuous ""Miami Rhapsody"", and one can see his progression in his smart work on episodes of ""Sex in the City"" and ""Entourage"". He moves the film at such a sharp, fast clip that it feels like an accurately frenzied portrayal of the inner workings of the world of haute couture. The one-line zingers also come fast and furious thanks to Aline Brosh McKenna's deep-dish script based on Lauren Weisberger's best-selling novel, but the vitriol does not come at the expense of character development and a shrewdly observed storyline about all-or-nothing careers when working for media royals and courtiers.<br/><br/>The plot's protagonist is not Priestly but Andy Sachs, a young idealist and aspiring journalist who just graduated from Northwestern. Even though she has no interest in fashion, she lands an interview at Runway. Because she is not a typically bootlicking, anorexic fashionista toady, Priestly hires her as her second assistant. It becomes a nightmarish trial by fire, as Andy slowly earns the trust of Priestly much to the chagrin of the haughty first assistant Emily. And despite the derision of her circle of friends, including her live-in boyfriend, Sachs starts to respect Priestly's style and power, which leads to the decision to have Andy go to Paris for Fashion Week. Further complications ensue when a hotshot writer takes an interest in her and a power struggle erupts at Runway.<br/><br/>It really takes someone of Streep's caliber to pull off the impossible character of Priestly because when she does have a moment of vulnerability, it resonates so much more than it should. Although she is far too pretty to be considered frumpy by anyone's standards, the naturally likable Anne Hathaway plays Sachs serviceably and looks sensational in a series of Chanel outfits. She brings the necessary heart to the story, even though the character arc is rather predictable. It does seem a shame that we are supposed to cheer the character's reduction from size 6 to 4, but that is probably as accurate as anything else in the film.<br/><br/>There is terrific work from the reliable Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Runway's no-nonsense fashion director, especially as he patiently works under Priestly's shadow and gives Sachs hard-to-take survival advice, and from Emily Blunt, who plays first assistant Emily with the ideal combination of vitriol and desperation. Overly metrosexualized with the strangest blond eyebrows I have ever seen, Simon Baker lends an appropriately smarmy edge to his writer Christian Thompson. Far less interesting are Sachs' judgmental friends, in particular Adrian Granier as Sachs' sous-chef boyfriend and Tracie Thoms as art gallery owner Lilly. The ending is inevitable, but it moves in a creative way that makes neither Sachs overly heroic nor Priestly absolutely villainous. This is solid entertainment elevated by the artistry of Streep."

","I'm not a girl, so I knew next to nothing about Anne Hathaway, I went to see Meryl Streep and oh boy, did I see her. An inedited Meryl Streep, far, far away from anything she has ever done and that is saying something, isn't it? Blazing with self confidence, Miranda Pristley is a monumental modern queen. Hints of human trouble at her own personal castle doesn't disturb that imperious facade and her extraordinary talent to say ""No"" I may be totally out of touch but I just wanted Anne Hathaway out of the way. It bother me so much. I longed for the young Julie Christie in that role. The Christie of ""Darling"" can you imagine? Then yes you have a battle of the titans not a predictable, tired, phony fairy tale. When Hathaway's boyfriend tells her ""You have become one of them"" I wanted to shoot myself because that's obviously what was suppose to happen but other than different outfits and make up I saw no difference in the girl. I enjoyed very much Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt's performance and I'm recommending the film just to witness Meryl Streep, the greatest actress of our or any generation, dazzles us with an extraordinary new face."
"CanadianWunderkind","9","238","388","1 July 2006"," A great adaptation of an alright book.
","For the past month or so, I have been eagerly awaiting this movie. I love Meryl Streep, I like Anne Hathaway, I though the world of magazine publishing could make a great setting for a movie, and I thought the premise of the book 'The Devil Wears Prada' had a lot of movie potential. So, now that I've seen it, I have to say it is one of the funniest movies I've seen this year. The screenwriter has maintained everything that was funny about the book, as well as chucked a lot of the duller subplots, and has formulated a movie that is a great deal more enjoyable than the book.<br/><br/>I'm sure you're all familiar with the basic premise - naive small-town girl comes to the big city hoping to be a journalist, and gets a job as assistant to Miranda Priestly, the much-feared editor of 'Runway' magazine (a thinly veiled take on 'Vogue' magazine, and its editor). Thankfully, the cast was almost perfect (though I did think Simon Baker was somewhat miscast at the rakish writer who takes a liking to the protagonist, Andrea), and elevated the movie to a level it would not have otherwise reached.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is absolutely amazing as Miranda Priestly, and I especially liked the way that, as Miranda, she never raised her voice above normal speaking level. Streep has said she based this mannerism on Clint Eastwood, who as Dirty Harry talks very quietly but still intimidates. This made Miranda much more interesting than the stereotypical, screaming gorgon she could have become. She is certainly the best thing about this movie, and I think the odds are good that she'll score a best-actress nod at the next Oscars. Miranda is also made more complex (and slightly more sympathetic) than in the book, which I thought was very good. In the book, which I recently read, the author (who actually worked as an assistant to 'Vogue' editor Anna Wintour) was very bitter and whiny about the difficulties of her former job, and she made Miranda out to be a totally two-dimensional villain with absolutely no redeeming qualities. However, the movie shows us (briefly) a different side of Miranda - we see the compromises she has had to make to get to the top, and we see the toll this has taken on her personal life. We aren't made to agree with her diva-like behaviour, but we can understand how hard her life must be.<br/><br/>I also thought that Anne Hathaway was very appealing in her role - she made Andrea more likable and less snobbish than she was in the book (although the screenwriter deserves credit for that, as well), and she looked great in the couture she wore through most of the movie.<br/><br/>The supporting players were also very good, especially Emily Blunt (as Andrea's caustic fellow assistant, Emily) and Stanley Tucci (as Miranda's loyal but beleaguered right-hand man, Nigel). On many occasions, they stole scenes from the ostensibly 'central' character of Andrea.<br/><br/>The movie, while maintaining the book's premise, does not follow the book too closely, which I liked. The entire 'Lily' subplot from the book is eliminated (readers of the book will know what I mean), and Andrea's parents and boyfriend are less significant in the movie than in the book. I agreed with these changes, though - I found those aspects of the book to be quite boring, and their omission made for a more streamlined movie.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to virtually anyone, and I just hope ""The Nanny Diaries"" (another somewhat-similar 'chick lit' movie adaptation, coming out soon with Scarlett Johannson, that I am eagerly awaiting) lives up to the shining example of this excellent movie."
"pbrown1685","6","143","236","6 July 2006"," Cast almost salvages predictable script.
","The Devil Wears Prada struck me much like the industry that provides its backdrop  pure surface, well promoted and unabashedly convinced of its own importance. If this was in fact the point of the piece, it is an absolute success. Otherwise, this highly-publicized film is painfully predictable and merely another incarnation of a plug-in script whose story arc has been traversed over and over . . . and over.<br/><br/>Let's see, it goes something like this; basically decent, idealistic, young (man/woman) goes to (New York/Chicago/Los Angeles/D.C.) to make his/her mark in (writing/business/music/acting/government) only to be temporarily seduced by the very environment/person they are the antithesis of, alienating his/her(boyfriend/girlfriend/family/friends/all of the above) in the process until he/she stumbles on to the revelation, ""To thine own self be true."" Devil is all of this. . . again. Only the trendy names being dropped have been updated for those who find that sort of thing significant enough to make them believe this is somehow a different story.<br/><br/>The characters, as written, are equally as plugged-in and predictable. The film is only watchable because of the efforts of three actors. Streep is superb -- as always -- as Miranda Priestly, the self-absorbed, career-obsessed and patently unpleasant publishing mogul. Every incredulous look and pursed lip is right on the mark. She is not however, showing us anything we haven't been shown before  either about her acting or about women at the top. Even Miranda's obligatory ""vulnerability scene"" is thin and comes too late in the film to matter. By the time we witness what angst she is capable of, we really don't care. We are left with less a feeling of empathy than a sense of justice. (If you want to see her be truly chilling and ruthless, check out the remake of Mancherian Candidate.) <br/><br/>Likewise, Emily Blunt, as Miranda's first assistant, does a wonderful job as an insecure, over compensating slave to someone else's expectation. Her portrayal is cattily on target and provides the requisite foil to our heroine's wide-eyed innocence. Performance-wise this is commendable, but it leaves the audience with next to nothing to like about her character. The dilemma here is that the film presents her (as well as the character of Miranda) in such a way that we have this nagging feeling maybe we are supposed to like her in some way  and yet, we don't. This creates even more of a dilemma later on when Andrea  our supposedly intelligent, perceptive and grounded protagonist, played forgettably by Anne Hathaway-- makes attempts to befriend these two soulless women. Many are left to perceive her gestures as a weak and irritating need to be liked rather than any real nobility of character.<br/><br/>The one true bright spot of the film is Stanley Tucci, as Nigel, who once again seems to infuse a refreshing dimension and humanity to a character that was probably not written that way. He continues to amaze.<br/><br/>Cinematically, The Devil was a small-screen script seemingly shot for the small screen. It no doubt will look stunning when it reaches HBO to be embraced by all those starving fans of Sex in the City and many others who believe that haute couture must surely be the apex of man's cultural accomplishments and that watching insensitive, catty women snipe at each other is actually entertaining.<br/><br/>Billed as a ""comedy/drama,"" the film was never very touching and only mildly amusing. There were no new insights or honest laughs -- the kind you share with friends about the mutually-experienced absurdities of life. No. The audience responses were more like those sophisticated, obligatory snickers that you exchange over lattes with people you don't really know that well -- and are reasonably certain you wouldn't want to spend time with again."
"segacs","4","55","87","23 December 2006"," Devilishly unfunny
","This movie generated so much buzz when it came out that I initially resisted seeing it. Now that I finally did, I can't help but wonder what all the hype was about.<br/><br/>Starring Meryl Streep opposite Anne Hathaway, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is loosely based on the book by the same name, and was billed as a funny-but-edgy insider's look into the cutthroat world of fashion. Instead, it is a fairly pedestrian teen movie, built along the lines of ""She's All That"" or its million predecessors, where the plain Jane girl gets a makeover and all her dreams come true. Or something.<br/><br/>Because the message itself gets a little lost here. Ostensibly, this movie is supposed to tell us that the world of fashion is evil, superficial, full of back-stabbers and snotty ""clackers"", and utterly devoid of any true meaning or purpose. But simultaneously, it tries to elevate fashion to a worthy pursuit on the same level as, say, curing AIDS or fighting world poverty. In trying to at once pay homage to and dissect the fashion world, the movie succeeds at neither.<br/><br/>Much has been said about the acting, namely, Meryl Streep's portrayal of her character. And while I agree that her deliberately understated performance elevated this movie to something beyond ""disaster"", I'd hardly give her lavish praise. Simply put, she's not nearly ""devilish"" enough. She's tough and, at first, snarky, but we never truly believe that she's evil. Driven, yes. Willing to step over people to get what she wants, sure. But evil?<br/><br/>In fact, nobody is quite mean enough here. Emily Blunt's character is snooty but ultimately likable, and Stanley Tucci plays the kind of ""gal pal"" every girl wishes she had. For a supposedly cutthroat world, people are falling all over themselves to help each other out. So much for the Devil.<br/><br/>And Anne Hathaway is charming and all, but she is just horribly miscast as the ugly duckling. She's a gorgeous girl who looks like a fashion model wearing the designer clothing she struts around in most of the movie, but she looked stunning even before that ""makeover"" and the suggested message was that the world of fashion has ridiculous, unrealistic standards. <br/><br/>That said, the movie never really passes enough judgment on these standards. When her success at work leads her to drive away those closest to her, the movie portrays her in a sympathetic light, and her boyfriend and her friends are portrayed as simply jealous, as opposed to as real people who love her for who she is and not for what she wears. When Hathaway's character proudly boasts that she's dropped from a size 6 to a size 4, it's done in such a way to make viewers believe that this is actually a good thing! Far from inspiring people to do the right thing, I fear all this movie will inspire is an epidemic of anorexia among young girls.<br/><br/>In the world of The Devil Wears Prada, there are no consequences, no shame, and no sore feet from running around town all day wearing ridiculous shoes. The plot is utterly ridiculous, including such impossible situations as Hathaway's character obtaining the (not yet written) manuscript to the seventh Harry Potter book. Can we at least stick to something with some semblance of reality here, people? <br/><br/>Salma Hayek's adaptation of ""Betty La Fea"" as ""Ugly Betty"", starring America Ferrera, takes the same concept and does it quite a bit better, to tell the truth. I'd give this a skip and try watching the TV series instead; whatever its faults, at least it has a bit more heart than this mess."
"fifteenpercent","3","113","190","2 July 2006"," All the Wrong Messages
","I was horribly offended by this film. Andy's friends act like she's selling her soul to work at Runway, as if it's not just an occupational hazard to submit to cruel bosses here and there. The whole premise of her accepting the job in the first place is that she can then move on to enviable roles in other magazines. What the hell is wrong with that?!!! How is spending a year working your ass off some kind of spiritual sin? It doesn't make any sense.<br/><br/>And she gets accused of doing to Emily what Priestly does to Tucci's character, but that's so clearly not the case. Why should Andy or anyone else sacrifice their promotion for co-workers that never made any effort to be nice to them in the first place? Ideally promotions are awarded meritocratically and why shouldn't we believe that Andy is just as qualified and deserving of her new responsibilities as Emily? Because she wasn't there as long? That's retarded people! The real world doesn't operate this way. When was the last time you gave up a promotion for some co-worker who was an asshole to you and didn't necessarily do her job as well? The basic message of this movie is that you shouldn't be ambitious, because if you are you will be punished by your friends and family--is this women really need to hear more of this bullshit? You're suppose to presume that had Andy completed her year there she would have set herself permanently on the path to crazed careerism which led to Miranda's second divorce. Oh, everyone at Runway is so unhappy. It's not worth it to be at the top of your field in fashion. I mean, it's absurd.<br/><br/>Oh, and sous chef boyfriend at one point declares how they should stop pretending that he and Andy have anything in common anymore. Oh my God. You obviously had precious little in common in the first place if girlfriend + an unusually stressful year of work is enough to eviscerate all that you used to have in common. In the real world, partners go through periods when they become absorbed by intense spells and relationships survive, because in good relationships partners support the long-term goals of their sig others. How do you think doctors complete their residencies with their relationships in tact? The gratuitous fashion montages were fantastic, but Anne Hathaway is a less than formidable talent that works best when she's posing all Brunette Barbie style. I actually walked out after Andy threw her cell phone in the fountain. I figured there wouldn't be anymore eye candy post-Runway and I'd have to sit through some predictable reconciliation scene where she's apologizing to her boyfriend for having had the misguided notion that the people who loved her might enjoy watching her succeed. <br/><br/>And it's just a stale, middle-of-the-road mainstream feature in a multitude of other dimensions. Save for Meryl Streep's white hot performance this movie sucks. View this movie only to witness a blatant example of how society wants to sabotage women's economic success."

","Without Meryl Streep, The Devil Wears Prada would get maybe a 5 rating, but because of Ms. Streep giving a performance that will undoubtedly get her a 14th Oscar nomination it is reason alone to see it. Is it even possible for her to do something that is even remotely similar to anyone of her past characters? The answer is NO! Her Miranda Priestley is once again a completely new role that seems made for her and she is so deliciously devilish that you want her in every scene, but we'll settle for a supporting actress nomination come February in a movie that would have essentially been Pricess Diaries 3 without her. A very enjoyable summer fluff movie that is a great escape thanks, once again to the brilliant Meryl Streep."

","No! Miranda Pristley can say it or merely breath it and the refusal comes as a devastating blow to her eager bunch of minions . Those moments were my favorites in a film that promises a hearty meal but delivers a frustrating bland soufflé. Meryl Streep however, makes it palatable and some times right down delicious. Anne Hathaway , so good in ""Brokeback Mountain"", is so uninteresting here that she manages to survive only when she's sharing the frame with Meryl Streep and that's because we're not looking at her. How can the fairy tale be so uneven, how can we possibly root for the evil stepmother rather than Cinderella. That seems a miscalculation of enormous proportions. All in all I could actually seat through the whole thing again just to see Meryl/Miranda purse her lips."

There was this, seen this before feeling I had through out the whole movie, when I watched it. Don't take wrong though, it's a nice little film. Direction is good enough, the script is good and the actors do their work as they should.<br/><br/>There has been a lot of praise towards Meryl Streep in this film, and you can't deny, if she weren't a talented actress. But the thing is, like it is for all ""villains"" in the films, the story isn't about her. It's about this young, naive girl played by Anne Hathaway, and her friends and life, which is actually left as a background noise. In the end, her life outside the jobs pressure is just a flat piece of paper, with people with make up personalities.<br/><br/>But for what it's worth, this movie flows with ease, even though you can guess the plot in the exact moment the film starts. It delivers no surprises nor twist, but then again, it's not the worst example of stories of its genre.<br/><br/>In short, it's reasonably good waste of time."

The first assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) advises Andrea about the behavior and preferences of their cruel boss, and the stylist Nigel (Stanley Tucci) helps Andrea to dress more adequately for the environment.

In this version of the story, Andy (the Anne Hathaway character) reluctantly takes a job as assistant to the editor of a prominent fashion magazine even though she wants to be a serious journalist. As time goes on, she forgets what is important in life--for example, she misses her boyfriend's birthday party because she has to work late, puts up with the unreasonable demands of her tyrannical boss at any hour of day or night, starts to enjoy the shallow pursuit of dressing well, loses her sense of humor, betrays her boyfriend by flirting with an attractive writer at a party, and agrees to her boss's request that she replace her co-assistant on a trip to Paris even though her colleague has been dreaming of the trip for months. The magazine editor (Meryl Streep) in this version is a cold, self-absorbed and calculating boss-from-hell who enjoys tormenting the people who work for her and cares only about outer beauty. In the end of this story, Andy regains her principles, summons up the courage to quit her horrid job at the meaningless fashion magazine, goes to work for a newspaper where she can make a difference in the world, gives away her couture outfits and goes back to not paying an overly large amount of attention to how she looks, and demonstrates in various ways that she once again cares about other people.<br/><br/>In the other story, the Meryl Streep character is an extremely talented fashion editor who is under tremendous pressure to make her magazine successful artistically and commercially. She is obsessive about her work because she cares about it and because she knows that she must do it extremely well in order to keep her position. She feels that her work is meaningful because it holds up an entire economic industry that includes mainstream as well as couture clothing and because (since fashion is fun when it's done well) it helps people of all sorts to enjoy life more. She believes that no one can do her job as well as she can, and she probably is right. She puts a huge amount of time into her job (losing two husbands and missing out on important times with her daughters as a result), and demands that the people who work for her show at least a fraction of her own dedication to their jobs as well as help to make her life a little easier. Because she is perfectionistic and under time pressure, she expects the people around her to be ultra- competent at all times and throws out chilly little comments when she feels her employees are not doing a good job or (especially) wasting her extremely precious time. She knows how business works as well as how to use her power in order to get what she needs in order to create a high-quality magazine and (in a cut-throat business) keep her job. At one point she hurts her most valued employee in order to keep herself from being fired, but (since she is shown helping people she thinks are talented even when it is not to her own benefit) it seems likely that she will help him to obtain other opportunities in the future. She is aware that the people who work for her are scared to death of her and that her general reputation is that of an icy terror, but she can't figure out how to do her job well plus have people like her. She also fails at all attempts to explain to other people why she acts as she does. After Andy (whom she thinks of as her protégé) quits, she is disappointed that the promising young woman decided to opt out of a career in the fashion business. Nonetheless, she is impressed and pleased that Andy is successfully seeking out her own chosen path in life, and helps her to do so by giving her a stellar letter of recommendation. In this reading of the story, the magazine editor is a tragic character of classic dimensions, in that she is not able to sustain relationships or obtain understanding from people around her while exercising her substantial professional and creative gifts.<br/><br/>Which reading of the movie is ""correct""? The one you choose probably has a lot to do with your life experiences and the way in which you see the world. Either could be right. <br/><br/>Only really great texts can be read in such totally disparate ways and argued forever with no firm conclusion ever reached. The fact that this characteristic is buried in what seems on the surface to be merely a light (and very funny) mainstream summer comedy makes its presence even more impressive.<br/><br/>As a side note, the original novel presented only the first reading (at least unless one looks extremely intently between the lines). The people responsible for adding the second reading (Meryl Streep, the screenwriter, the director, whoever) deserve more than Oscars. A brilliant work all around."

","I got a chance to see a sneak preview, and it was better than expected. First, I have to say that I've never read the book. My friend who saw it with me read it, and she said that the movie was pretty faithful to the book. <br/><br/>The movie stars Anne Hathaway, a writer who winds up applying for, and getting the second assistant position to the Editor-in-Chief of THE fashion magazine called ""Runway."" Her boss is played by the always fantastic Meryl Streep. While she gets less screen time in the movie, her mean looks and bitchy attitude makes her character stick with you. Also, the movie does give you some soft moments to make her a little more sympathetic than she was portrayed in the novel (or so my friend told me). I do wonder whether or not this movie would've worked if Meryl's character was male instead of female. <br/><br/>I won't bore you with the other plot details because it was actually fun to not know how it unravels. Without the novel to go by, it was fun to figure out what bad thing was going to happen to her next. I do have to say that the movie has achieved the balance of being cute but not corny. You also get to understand why she just takes it all instead of just quitting to begin with. It's funny enough to make you laugh out loud, but more importantly, it's a great film to escape to. Hey, at least for the majority of us, we can come out of the theater and say, ""At least my boss isn't like that."""
"Jim-500","Null","29","48","3 July 2006"," Too many holes
","This could have been a good movie if it didn't have so much that didn't make sense. <br/><br/>When Andy has become comfortable in her new job, she is handing out gifts to all her friends, and they love it. Then all of a sudden, for no reason we ever see, they complain that she ""isn't the same old Andy."" Just because she is working hard? We never see any evidence of her being anyone different than she was at the beginning. She misses her boyfriend's birthday party because she had to work late? That doesn't mean she's a bad person. And she shows that she's sorry in a very sweet way. But I guess we're supposed to hate her now. <br/><br/>Then one of her girlfriends sees this high-power writer guy make a pass at her, which she quickly snubs. But the friend acts like Andy was into it, reminds her about her boyfriend, and walks off in a huff. It makes no sense--Andy clearly was not into the guy, but her friend acts like she was. Then the way Andy just completely disses Miranda at the end, after they have come to mean something to each other, would have only made sense in the middle of the movie. Here, it comes off as just a convenient--but illogical--way to end the show. Then boyfriend Nate takes her back, despite the fact that they have two new jobs in two different cities; how they are going to stay together isn't even brought up. <br/><br/>Speaking of Nate, he seems like an understanding, regular guy, the kind who would support his girlfriend in whatever she wanted to do. Working like hell in your first job in New York City? It's an incredible opportunity; no way would his character suddenly decide that her career was more important than him. Of course, it probably was just a plot device to make it okay for Andy to fool around with that writer without any guilt, and this tete-a-tete sets up a twist near the end. <br/><br/>This movie seems to want to be an insider's look at the rough-and-tumble world of fashion; I found it unbelievable. Not that I don't believe you have to work for demanding bosses and cut down the number of personal hours in your life; but to think that your friends would abandon you because you're pursuing a dream doesn't ring true. And there is the crux of the problem: are we supposed to be angry with Andy, or Miranda, or the seemingly inhuman fashion world? We're never given a consistent sense of who's the villain here. <br/><br/>In the end, the most unbelievable thing for me about this movie was how Andy was deemed ""fat"" by the fashion world. Come on; nobody would ever consider Anne Hathaway fat; not even the Devil."

","With dialog that absolutely crackles, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is bound to please most audiences but will primarily appeal to the MTV generation, I suspect. When all is said and done, it's your typical fish-out-of-water, bright-lights-big-city fable, just dressed up all purdy.<br/><br/>Or, put another way, it's essentially ""The Princess Diaries"" with much, much, muuuuuuuuuch better dialog and a slightly more sophisticated and dramatic story arc.<br/><br/>So while older audiences may feel the film is a bit formulaic, the hysterical, but occasional cruel, one-liners and zingers hurled at Anne Hathaway's Andy are sure to keep them entertained. Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt get most of the barbs, and Blunt in particular is fantastic in the film.<br/><br/>Tucci and Meryl Streep, however, get to make the most provocative and stirring speeches in the film, and they deliver. Hathaway capably carried the movie, perhaps overacting, but she makes it work. Streep proves again that she's a gifted comedian. Emily Blunt, as Emily, is pitch perfect, and her performance here gives beautiful irony to her given name.<br/><br/>The film is just too long, however, primarily because the director feels obliged to explain everything -- every plot point is rendered obviously and painfully clear, and nothing left open for interpretation. That said, we're spared the ""perfect ending"" and left with a heroine who can truly stand on her own two feet, and in any shoes she might desire."
"ingres77","5","14","21","20 January 2007"," A Wasted Effort
","Have you ever seen a film with more talent than it knew what to do with, a plot that's worked a hundred times, and was based off a popular source that still failed? Here's your opportunity to see such a film if you can't think of another time it's happened.<br/><br/>Why does it fail? What possible reason could I have for saying that a film which made a good profit at the box office, earned Golden Globe nominations (and will likely earn an Oscar nomination for Streep) failed? Simple. There was only one character in the entire movie whom I liked. I hated Miranda (Meryl Streep) almost as much as I hated Andy (Anne Hathaway). The only character I liked was the wry Nigel, Miranda's charming and loyal assistant played wonderfully by Stanley Tucci. And he was only a minor character, with too few scenes.<br/><br/>Nigel was the one dose of humanity and rationality, and he saved this movie from it being my lowest rated film of the year, narrowly being beaten out by Scary Movie 4. At least I knew I was getting crap when I saw SM4. I expected more from The Devil Wears Prada, considering the reviews and talent involved.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the film, Andy is a naive small town girl who goes to NY to become a journalist. She gets an assistants job for a fashion magazine, even though she knows nothing about fashion and doesn't care about it, either. She's just doing it, in the beginning, to open some doors.<br/><br/>Only she gets corrupted by the industry she was so apathetic about, and gets so sucked in that she abandons her friends and boyfriend (who isn't developed enough for me to care about). She's so far gone, that she ignores an opportunity to do journalism when it's practically thrown at her.<br/><br/>So why does Andy throw everything away from something she doesn't even end up wanting (a career in journalism)? Because she wants to prove her boss, Miranda, wrong. That's it. Miranda is hard on Andy, who almost quits. But after coming to the realization that she hasn't ""given it her all"", she redoubles her efforts and becomes the best assistant ever.<br/><br/>She stabs her colleague in the back (and goes to Paris in her place). She leaves her boyfriend and sleeps with another guy (while she's drunk, and after she says 'no' a few times). She abandons her friends and family. All for a job she initially didn't care about, and which she really never cares about. She does it all for Miranda.<br/><br/>Yet we're given absolutely no logical reason why she should care so much about Miranda, a woman who never gives her any respect, isn't remotely likable, and goes out of her way to make the lives of her assistant hell.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, I wanted to throw something at my TV and scream, ""you've lost everything for absolutely no reason! You're the dumbest character I've ever seen in a movie of this much potential!""<br/><br/>But, alas, it would've been a wasted effort. Of course, Andy finally realizes that she'd made the wrong choices the entire time (who'd have imagined that it wasn't a good idea to throw your entire life away for something you didn't care about?), and made up with her boyfriend (who was wooden, shallow, and undeveloped). <br/><br/>Final analysis: avoid."
"freshkidd","3","42","75","5 July 2006"," Much ado about nothing
","Meryl Streep is always an amazing actress but there is no depth to her character nor to anyone else's. She plays a sadistic, bitchy boss who makes impossible demands to a young woman who gets the impossible done out of nothing more than fear. If there is determination to make it (or as Streep's character infers because they are so alike) it is not apparent. There is almost no plot. Even the NY Times had an article stating that no one in the real fashion world would dress like these people. No plot, no character development and no real fashion. It was a big disappointment. It was unclear if Streep's superficial relationship with her children was because she had no life outside of the magazine or because she was indeed that superficial."

","I watched the DVD of this film on Christmas Eve with a bunch of friends. I've heard so much about it and how well it was doing, I couldn't wait to take a look. What a huge disappointment. It was slow, boring and predictable.<br/><br/>Sadly, it's becoming difficult to find 'orginality' in film year after year, so when you have something that is the same as something else, you've gotta do the best you can to entertain at $10 plus a ticket, $4.99 a rental. I did have the mind set that I was going to watch a theme that I had seen before. What I did not expect was that I was watching a theme I had seen before from several films that were also ""so-so"" to snoozers. It was the re-hashing of already cooked hash that wasn't good when it was new. <br/><br/>Maybe it's the ""fashion industry"". Sounds like a good thing to bash since it seems pretty glamorous, treats women like objects and ""walking hangers just to see how the fabric of THEIR design flows"" and very cut throat so based on that, it should make an interesting, through provoking story. But from many of the films I've seen try to ""expose"" that industry, they've been ""okay"" to down right ""boring"". This one is one of the REALLY boring ones.<br/><br/>The story is the same: fish outa water girl (Anne Hathaway who's 98% of films she has done is playing this same type of role) gets job with total female tyrant over 40-year old boss (And these women have GOT to look as old as heck, fashionable but OLD - a trick from ""Valley of the Dolls"") (Meryl Steep) who treats her like a slave, she gets in with a male gay who 'secretly' helps her dress and 'play the game', she weighs her life against the work life, meets some guy her twice her age and a guy her age (pick any young actor of the moment and throw him in here) continues to question which one to bed/have, realizes she's a slave, tries to overcome tyrant female boss, the industry and herself to realize she's better than what she's doing. Throw in a few fashionatas,(top models, runway showing, magazine covers, camera hungry Eurpean designers people watching can point at and say, ""Isn't that so and so? Wow!"" some nice clothes for this time, a somewhat shallow ""I'm being used"" ploy and you've got ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and 25 other films before it - except you used the name of a top line of fashion design to make it more ... sexy.<br/><br/>What also bothered me about this film is that I caught on early that no one spoke over one line sentences and formed words over seven letters long. But ... everybody looked good, the women traded simplistic ""cat fight"" snarls, and everyone fit into their stereo-typical part nicely - so I guess that makes it a blockbuster film.<br/><br/>""Blockbusters"" aren't like as they used to be, I guess. If you're looking for a little depth skip this, if your looking for meaningless time to kill with folks wearing nice clothes and conversing in short cliché sentences with no thought process behind them, and you like knowing what sentence and scene is coming next, this may be your kinda film."

","For a film to be enjoyable you need to be able to understand or emphasise with the characters and their motivations. For the life of me I couldn't stand just about any of the main characters and frankly found them horrible. I can watch a movie like ""Downfall"" and hate the Hitler character but I understand the context of it all. Here you have these shallow people and this person who goes to work for a horrible boss and wants to please her. Firstly, I wouldn't have taken such a role but I think I probably would have lasted about 5 minutes before telling her to shove the job up her a**e! The people are all so plastic and shallow that it is hard to see anything in them to like. I guess there are people who are attracted to this sort of industry and probably loved the movie as a result but I just didn't get it. I think it is because I can't see how anyone could put up with these cardboard cut outs. There is a scene where they are discussing what colour something is and then the Meryl Streep character enlightens a slightly bemused Hathaway that it was her who bought this new colour in fashion to the world's attention. I mean, give the women a Noble Prize for her contribution to the world.<br/><br/>The whole thing is a pointless episode in shallowness.<br/><br/>I have given it three stars because the acting (particularly Streep) is pretty good and the film is well shot. Apart from that there isn't really much to recommend it."

She doesn't write, almost loses boyfriend and learns nothing but fitting in the hysteric fashion mold. Had she been a Bridget Jones, it might have been funny. But the girl is already tall, thin and perfect from take one, and when she becomes a size 4 you don't notice any difference.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are wonderful - and that's about it."

There was no nuance, no development -- sure she was a fabulous bitch, but after ten minutes, it became really boring.<br/><br/>As to the rest of the cast, they were good, especially Emily Blunt, but the story was so predictable as to be ridiculous. I've always enjoyed Anne Hathaway, especially in Brokeback Mountain, and she tried valiantly, but someone it was unbelievable that someone like Streep's character would have taken such a chance on someone so tacky and experienced. Stanley Tucci was, as always, FABULOUS: although he played the character very gay, he was never offensively swishy.<br/><br/>At best, it seemed like a Lifetime Women's network movie of the week which should have featured Meredith Baxter or Judith Light."

","Sorry fans, but this movie is terrible. It insults your intelligence at every turn, lacks any real bite or insight, and, I assure you, flash clothes aside, this movie will ruin your evening. The production is slick, the editing pointlessly rapid, the cast yawningly toothsome, but where it really lets itself down is the plotting. Was this movie REALLY based on a book? Where's the story? The New York 'fashion scene' is so toadily portrayed and offers so little critique, I wondered just which fashion bigshot it was that the film-makers were going out of their way to avoid offending. But it's when the plot finally creaks and flops into Paris, in what passes for a 3rd act attending - ahem - ""Fashion Week"" that this movie just falls apart. <br/><br/>Why does aspiring serious 'writer' Andy, with her cool Bo-Ho credentials, stick around in the nauseating world of 'Runway' for so long? Okay, so she landed the job that 'a million girls would kill for', but the inevitable moral crisis for someone as principled as Andy is never satisfactorily explored. She's blatantly seduced by it, but we never get to understand any of the tension her character feels, or why she's the one we're meant to root for. Okay, I get that it's a comedy, but does Andy have to be such a vacuum? Oooh, nice freebies, and shooze!! Her cypher boyfriend seems to be there to continually remind us what we should all be thinking about her. Anyway, she chucks it all in on a whim at the end, seemingly to keep her lug of a boyfriend (to whom she has just been spectacularly unfaithful) happy.. ah, the fate of modern girls in modern cinema, doomed never to be truly free of a man's control.<br/><br/>Its (trite, superficial) 'fashion' appeal, and (relentlessly charmless) cast has garnered it some wincingly favourable reviews in the Fash Mags, but great title and the casting against type of Meryl Streep aside, this undercooked movie deserves to be quietly forgotten.

Her subtle brilliance is captivating, and one cant help but feel honored to watch her work! <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway delivers a charming performance that is incredibly likable.

","Another Meryl Streep vehicle. Talented actress - sometimes, in this movie NO!.Overacting ,hammy just plain ZZZ material. The main thing is it's all about Meryl playing a bitch which from what most people have reported saying about her is true to real life. She supposedly accepted an award with a smug look on her face that it was about time they announced her as the winner as she figured she'd already won before the winner was announced. Maybe she was joking but her speech indicated she possibly wasn't. In this movie she plays Miranda the editor in chief of Runway magazine (a takeoff of real life Vogue EIC Anna Wintour). Mean, nasty and ugly she tortures her staff most of whom are just about as nasty as she is since they work for her it rubs off. We have once nice girl who gets dragged into the nastiness but finally finds herself and gets out to pursue something more meaningful. The whole movie though is about Meryl playing the bitch and very irritatingly at that. I mean warranted I'm sure Wintour was a bitch too but Streep stretches it to a new low. 1/10"

","Having read Lauren Weisberger's novel when it first came out, didn't leave this viewer with a desire for watching the movie version of this tale of the people in the trendy media business that creates such a need for certain section of the population to run and buy all the latest designers' creations. One must say, that when the offer to borrow the DVD, presented an opportunity to compare the book with what comes out in the film.<br/><br/>David Frankel follows the screen play that was put together by Ms. Weisberger and Aline Brosh McKenna, and keeps the essence of the book much intact. The finished product will baffle people outside the realm of fashion since it capitalizes on name dropping and inside jokes. The idea of a powerful woman, who is so self centered, she forgets what reality is like, shows us a world in which the idea of having the latest gives a person some value in life just by wearing what's in vogue at the moment.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is basically the whole reason for watching the film. As the tyrannical Miranda Priestly, she is worth the price of admission, or rental. Ms. Streep never raises her voice in order to get her point across. Her Miranda shows a cruelty beyond belief, yet, her own life is a mess. Miranda would be the last person to be a role model to imitate. Miranda is basically a self-made woman who probably came out of the same background of the young assistants she loves to terrorize, belittle and make them feel inadequate. Miranda can dictate to others, but she can't do anything to save her own marriage.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway surprises in her role of Andy Sachs. Never has she been so beautifully presented in any film she has appeared. She seems to be a natural who carries herself well against the rest of the people in the magazine. Emily Blunt is another asset. Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker, and the rest of the cast do a good job for the director."

","Phil Spector invented modern pop music. Oh, some elements shift from time to time and different performer types are selected to posture in front. But the basic formula is one of filling all the holes. He called it ""wall of sound,"" but Eric Clapton popularized the notion that the lead defines ""holes"" and its the job of the producer to fill them all.<br/><br/>It has to do with some hardwired notion of richness in the way we perceive things. My own theory is that usually we encounter things that to be understood have to be placed in some sort of context. We have to provide that context by being whole beings who have our own world and understand it. But we don't, usually. We're incomplete, lazy about this. We want prefabricated worlds to provide context and eliminate ambiguities.<br/><br/>That's why we prefer it when an object comes with its own context, like in pop music where there is no vacuum for us to use. Fashion is the same way: there's some sort of bold statement, but it only works if all the holes are filled with accompanying items and attitudes.<br/><br/>And its the same with movies. If you want a movie to be popular, to sit well in the popular eye, you need to make it lush in the small. This project shows signs that it is carefully produced in this way. Look at what happens in the backgrounds: colors, energy, motion. Look at what happens in the blocking: compound events conflated. Look at even the simple setup where a friend sees our young heroine flirt with a suitor. There's a huge amount of attention paid to the environment and the people which surround her.<br/><br/>A Paris street walk is another very fine example.<br/><br/>It isn't as valuable as what I usually look for: actual cinematic art. This is more craft, stagecraft. But it is well enough done to be admired. And entirely apt for a story about an industry that does the same thing.<br/><br/>+++++ <br/><br/>There are essentially four characters in this. The boss, our young writer, the ""first assistant"" who is placed in between in several ways, and the gay (we infer) fashion expert who is placed in between in other ways.<br/><br/>Part of the richness is that each of these is fuller than the usual ""lesson"" movie would have. All four are compelling performances. But if you haven't yet seen this, I'd like you to pay particular attention to Emily Blount. She's the number 1 assistant.<br/><br/>You've probably seen her before in the very special ""My Summer of Love,"" something human about love and seductions. I think she's a real talent, something different than the others. Oh, they're very good at what they do, finding the right notes. But this woman has something else, something more visceral.<br/><br/>You see, you can dance your own context into this and turn it from something that has no room for you. Try it by following the Emily Blount character, whose name is also Emily. (Hathaway's character is the ""new Emily."") <br/><br/>+++++ <br/><br/>The moral issue we are meant to capture is more sophisticated than usual, too. Streep's character isn't a devil at all. She isn't quite a useful person in the manner that she actually creates. She doesn't make anything. She doesn't create or design or do anything normally considered the root of the food chain in term of value.<br/><br/>She's part journalist, a sort of elevated, influential journalism that Anne's character doesn't have the horsepower to accept. She's also an arbiter of what matters. Its not a new notion, that some journalists create the world they present, and make it seem real by absolute consistency and projected confidence. Its what politics is. Fashion and politics, religion.<br/><br/>That final challenge, about whether our young journalist will follow what she sees as the devil, that final challenge is more complex than it seems. And though this is a mainstream movie, part of the enrichment is that they didn't tone it down. And they left us with the conclusion that the girl left and wrote the story we see, one which casts the successful worldbuilder as the devil.<br/><br/>++++ <br/><br/>Speaking about worldbuilders and fashion. To appreciate this movie, you must see the one on which it relies, ""Funny Face."" Audrey Hepburn, with the smile that Hathaway mines. Similar situation: fashion, clunky girl becomes fashionably adept, conflict between the ""real"" and pretend (in that case, philosophy). A trip to Paris  some of the very same establishing shots in fact. An ambiguous resolution that in Hepburn's case involved photography instead of writing.<br/><br/>That movie made Jackie Kennedy possible, which made Jack Kennedy president, and from there, another ""wall of sound"" that built a reality, incidentally concurrent with the rise of Phil Spector...<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Somewhere in the world, women scientists are trying to determine the nature of dark matter, are measuring and composing computer models regarding gamma ray bursters. They are crouched in the bush in Africa, observing bonobo behavior, and they are hunched over telescopes in laboratories, seeking a cure for cancer and doing micropaleontology. Women are building office buildings, designing bridges, doing climate research in Antarctica, and trying to design disease-resistant rice strains to help stave off famine.<br/><br/>But not in this movie. In this movie, women are obsessed with their exteriors in the mirror and with a bunch of goofy-looking clothes which, when they see themselves photographed in them fifteen years down the road will look as ludicrous as disco fashions look to us. They are permanently damaging their leg tendons from wearing high heels. They celebrate anorexia. This is a depiction of a slice of the real world, of course. While it is possible that most of these women are not smart enough to do science or engineering or real work, surely some of them are and it's a sad waste of human resources that they spend their time in this oppressive and oppressing career.<br/><br/>To a large degree, this movie celebrates this waste. Although our protagonist, at the end, leaves the fashion industry to do real journalism, the movie-makers obviously adore the fashion industry and do not lampoon it at all. They take it as serious as the ludicrous, misogynist 'devils' in the industry take it. For me, watching this is like watching a movie about faith healing that takes it deadly seriously. What a bunch of idiots thinks about some delusion is interesting only if the filmmakers and audience are also aware that it is delusion.<br/><br/>Certainly the film is workmanlike in technique. There are no shadows from boom mikes or inaudible dialog. And yes, Meryl Streep is fine as the understated boss from hell. But if this is the best Hollywood can do offering ""strong female roles,"" that's just tragic for us all."

","I think this is one of the most brilliant movies I have seen. It is quite scary. There is one quote that Miranda (Streep) has later in the movie and I think it is dead on 100% correct: ""everybody wants to be like us"".<br/><br/>The movie sends a strong message, more than just a quest for self-knowledge. It tells us more than fame isn't everything. It tells us that in order to truly be happy as yourself, you must experience what you want to be. Everybody wants to be famous. Everybody wants to be skinny. Everybody wants to be sexy. Only when you are famous, skinny, sexy, famous can you be satisfied of it. There is a quote a friend of mine used a while back; ""You can't be taught what bitter tastes like. No matter how many people tell you that you won't like something bitter, you will want it. Everybody must taste something bitter and learn that they don't like it."" This quote applies very well to this film. Go see it!"

The secondary love interest (Simon Baker) didn't make us feel she should be attracted to him, while the boyfriend (Adrian Grenier) made us wonder why she took up with him in the first place. Meanwhile, we only get a vague impression of the tension between Andy's growing respect and even sympathy for her boss and her horror at the costs of following Miranda's footsteps. Streep and Tucci deliver in spades, of course, but the only bright light among the younger actors was Emily Blunt, who plays her role as the suffering-servant senior assistant with a nice comic touch."

","I saw TDWP on the week it came out, and although I wasn't surprised that it became such a big box-office hit, the glowing reviews it got are beyond my comprehension. Granted, 2006 wasn't the strongest year for movies, but we had at least 10 or 15 better movies and the fact that the National Board of Review included this on their top 10 list is pretty ridiculous. It's nothing more than an average romantic comedy with some above the average performances (read: Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci, all of them steal the show from beautiful but bland leading lady Anne Hathaway), and a nice but predictable satire to the fashion world. As much as I love Streep, I wouldn't give her another Oscar nomination for this (Annette Bening in ""Running With Scissors"" - a pretty bad movie, but her performance is glorious - or Maggie Gyllenhaal in ""SherryBaby"", just to name a couple, were better), but then again, she could play a door and the Academy would still recognize her. Gorgeous Brazilian Gisele Bündchen got US$350 grand to appear in 2 brief scenes and proved (again) that, as an actress, she's a fabulous supermodel. If she had to act for a living, she'd be starving now. When you think of so many wonderful actresses who are waiting tables in NYC to pay the rent, this is even sadder...<br/><br/>Anyway, I digress.

","Watching 'The Devil Wears Prada' felt like watching a long commercial. It's exactly executed like a commercial. The story is hackneyed and follows the typical simple-honest-gullible chick looks for a job at some big place (in this case a publishing house for a fashion magazine) where everyone is bitchy, she gets the job and is pushed around a lot (especially by a big boss bitch) until she herself becomes a bitch, in the end she realizes that she lost herself and quits the job (but she still dresses like a fashion model and doesn't want to get back with her ex because he's merely a chef), she applies for a new job and only gets it because her bitchy boss (who suddenly has a heart of gold) recommends her. Amidst all this branded products like shoes, clothes, hotels and whatever crap are flashed all over the viewer's face. That's it. The only thing that motivated me to watch this was the fact that it starred Meryl Streep. She's a great actress (but unlike others I wouldn't exactly call her the best) and she's getting sexier with each new film. I thought she delivered a fine performance as the bitchy boss. However, I don't believe it was worthy of rewarding as there have been far better performances that year. Anne Hathaway is quite okay in the beginning but looks lost once she's given a 'makeover'. What's with all that excessive makeup and huge red lipstick?

"Flagrant-Baronessa","6","27","52","25 October 2006"," Forget about Meryl Streep, forget about Anne Hathaway  Emily Blunt's is the standout performance
","... in an otherwise forgettable fluff of a film that remains afloat, but falls apart a little due to morals and messages. There has certainly been buzz surrounding Meryl Streep's devilishly delicious performance as the cold Prada editor, and rightly so, for she does a fine job, capturing the tingling sarcasm in her character's voice, the pursing of her lips and the icy chill in her voice. She perfectly gets her bitch on. However let me debunk the myth that 'The Devil Wears Prada' is exclusively Streep's show: Hathaway's competitive assistant at Runway Magazine is a blunt scene-stealer whose emotional transparency translates sharply into a bitchy-yet-likable-young-career woman. Hopefully we'll see more of her...<br/><br/>When Andy Sachs (Hathaway) first steps foot into the prestigious Runway building  fresh out of Northwestern university and no interest whatsoever in the couture scene  she it met by a world of rapid-fire fashion jargon, cruel stares from skinny models and sass from superiors. It is a whole world of hierarchies, codes and fancy dresses (Runway is more than ""just a magazine"", after all) but arguably the first thing that jumps out and grabs you is Emily Blunt as Streep's assistant Emily  the sole survivor. The first half of the 'Prada' is an assured success due to its fast-paced navigation of the fashion industry and its many colourful characters like Nigel and Emily; it sucks you in. Hathaway fully reprises 'Princess Diaries' here but it works.<br/><br/>Next it regrettably initiates a process of ticking off clichéd ingredients from a standard formula: the homely-yet-likable-girl makes progress at work, she goes through the mandatory makeover moment from the gay designer and comes out stunningly pretty, her rivalries' jaws open, her boss approves. Cut to her private life, which takes a backseat in the film, but nonetheless suffers the more involved and ambitious she gets at work. The film raises questions such as, how far will she go to get what she wants? Will she conform? Will she be sucked in? Prada tiptoes around these notions for a bit but there is always the underlying message that says a woman has got to choose: love or career. Nice going on the equality front there, Hollywood. Way to perpetuate gender roles.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a good little diversion and for fashion buffs it must surely be heaven, or at least a petit mort, because the amount of product placement is baffling. Undoubtedly high-fashion labels such as Karl Lagerfeld and Jimmy Choo have paid good cash to be 'casually integrated' in the film. There is also a totally solid soundtrack that accompanies key scenes, such as the opening montage of Hathaway getting dressed in the morning in frumpy clothes while juxtaposed with the high-fashion models and their sleek outfits. Fun, but ultimately highly clichéd and too peppered with sexist messages to fully work.<br/><br/>""That's all.""<br/><br/>6 out of 10"

It says nothing of note, and - shock! horror! - it's just NOT funny! Great things were said about Streep's portrayal of Miranda Priestley, the bitch-editor from Hell, but her performance was repetitive and frankly, dull. The most that can be said about Streep is that the role is far removed from anything she's played before - and that's all the news that's fit to print about that as far as I'm concerned. She's an actor - that's what they do!! Act! God forbid anyone should get an Oscar for playing the same role over and over again (no, that could never happen).<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway, the unconvincing innocent, struggled to act; I may forgive her because she has a risible script to work with and seemingly no direction. The story was implausible and yes, that word again - dull. Her character, Andy, was in need of a good slap on more than one occasion just to get some life into the bones.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie was the game I invented to while away the time until it had finished. It's called 'Spot the Product Placement' and I think I won with over 45 incidences and that's not counting the shoes....<br/><br/>Truly, a waste of time and money.

It needed a little more of a tragic tone to emphasize the poignancy that seems to be taking over toward the end of the film. Instead, it appears to cop out at the end and fit the formula of a mainstream Hollywood film. The Weisberger novel was witty and well-written, and read like a funny memoir of a young New York girl's experience in the fashion industry and her not being able to properly fit in, despite some success. The film captured a little of this, but ultimately the style of the film fits in with mainstream films in which the heroine does not appear to take in what she's learned and does not appear affected by her isolating experiences. Anne Hathaway as Andy Sachs (notice that her last name is like ""Sachs Fifth Avenue"") is only a little god but Hathaway has very little experience with serious films or at least films like this one and her acting style is better used in comedies. She is trying too hard and it shows. Meryl Streep's acting is no doubt always good, but in this film, she does not capture the diabolical ""Cruella De Ville"" type of character I remember reading in the novel. Miranda Priestly is a cold, ambitious, proud woman who has risen to the top as a high fashion magazine editor and is consequently a lonely woman after a failed marriage. Miss Streep does not come off as bitchy or cruel. She comes off as indifferent and conservative. I don't really feel she did a good enough performance. When you have the two leads doing badly, you don't get a good film. The only real winner here is the story itself. Set in New York City's fashion scene, the film/book explores one young woman's entry into that world and her exit. Andy is the most unlikely person to get hired at a fashion magazine. She is highly individualistic and in the fashion scene, it's all about trends and following what's ""in"" and ""hip"". Andy dresses as she likes, irregardless of fashion trends. She is intelligent, urbane and has friends who are regular Joes (like her boyfriend Nate played by Adrian Grenier) and her transformation from anti-fashion gal to fashion gal is incredible. But this is not anything like Audrey Hepburn in ""Funny Girl"". Rather than glorifying fashion as that film does, this film presents that scene as just a business, and a tough one. When Andy discovers she has lost a boyfriend, friends and her own sense of self, she decides to quit working for Miranda. The chemistry between Streep and Hathaway could have been better. In the book, the relationship was almost like a mother/daughter type thing. I did love Simon Baker as Christian, another fashion industry guy, who charms Andy and even becomes her lover briefly. I felt that this sub-plot was too brief and could have been explored more. The music by Theodore Shapiro is lovely. The costumes (by Patricial Field) are well done but only because we know how photogenic both Hathaway and Streep are. But otherwise, the film lacks more of a tragic quality, and more character. Streep could have done better but it's possible the director, working with the author, opted to change her into a more sympathetic character we can understand and see her as fully human and less cartoonish. One wonders how different it would have been if they had cast Glenn Close (famous for over-the-top female characters) as Miranda. But I think that Hathaway would have had better chemistry with Close, considering Hathaway's own over-the-top teen characters. This film is not for everyone. Because it's a film about women, based on a woman's book, about women's fashion, this is not something most men would enjoy watching. There is very little for a man to enjoy (no nudity, no action) but this film still lacked more drama. We don't feel that Andy has learned and lost. I can only give it a 7 out of 10. Check out the film and see for yourself what all the buzz was once all about."

","There're lots of films dealing with the stories that the protagonist fights his/her way into some tough businesses and finally, either succeed or quit knowing his/her own places.One strength of this film is that it,too, picks up this sort of storyline,but the story is told in a sincere and believable way instead of a hyperbolic pretentiousness.<br/><br/>Although I assume some of the audiences were going for the 'glamorous' part in this film,i.e.the fancy shoes,dresses etc.worn by pretty Hathaway,one thing needs to be noted is that the story is far more accessible than those big brands.A newly graduated girl trying to get a job which can not only pay for her rent but also open doors for loads of opportunities.This, I believe, is something many of us can identify with in real life. Despite that she's admitted into a top-notch fashion magazine with a demonic female boss(which is somewhat dramatic of course),her dilemma about choosing between career and friends/love is yet another thing that most of us will have something to say. As I see,it is the key of this film's appeal.<br/><br/>Indeed,I shouldn't forget about the power of the cast.Attractive Anne Hathaway and great Meryl Streep.Lacking some handsome guys isn't the point,it's a film mainly about women: to be a career-obsessed woman or to be an ordinary women enjoying life is the question.And hell yeah,it's never solved.But this film,in the end,points out a direction for the women -well,perhaps implicitly -that smarter choice is to know your place and not to be so ambitious.As the cost you pay,seen in Miranda and Emily,is the absence of normal family and love relationship, is'the whole life that goes up in smoke'.Therefore,it can be argued that this film is ideologically conservative in nature.<br/><br/>Average audiences won't care much about this,all we need is a good story and I think we have it in this film.Although there're some clichés(such as the affair between Andy and Thompson),I have to say Streep plays quite well,also the actor starring Nigel.Hathaway could improve a bit but she's not too bad nonetheless."

The biggest disappointment is the comprimising of values in that Andy does not stick to who she is, and continues to dress in overpriced clothing--and loses a dress size when she is already very healthy looking. This movie makes anyone who is a size bigger than 6 feel fat and not worthy of nice clothing. Overall, the acting was great, the morals were horrible, and the plot leaves you unfulfilled. I wish that this amazing cast would have chosen a better script."

","I thought this movie was SO much fun and while it drifted from the book, it did so in a way as to not be annoying but to add to a really viciously fun story.

I am puzzled with what I consider the miscasting of Simon Baker -- not intriguing enough (or hell, at LEAST he should have kept his accent). Otherwise, vicious, silly and all around great.

","What an unfortunate way to celebrate a well-written novel. The screen-play adaptation loses all the magic of the book. This film has none of the charm; instead of an interesting, funny and touching plot, the campy big-screen adaptation only has two things going for it: Meryl Streep's substantial acting chops, and the lovely Anne Hathaway. Readers, say goodbye to the interesting subplots of the book; in fact, you can say goodbye to plots, period. Forget what you know about the characters. The screenplay's portrayal of Andi is flat and shallow, and Miranda's devilish tendencies have been pared down to boring antics.

","The thing that sticks out in my mind about this movie is that it is a fantasy about life in Manhattan dreamed up by someone who seems never to have set foot out of California, and whose image of New York was gleaned entirely from mid 20th century screwball comedies.<br/><br/>Spoiler: The scene in which Andy carries a tray of coffees through the street is something that wouldn't happen in real life Manhattan more than, maybe, 3 times. Someone at the coffee shop would notice her repeat appearances, & gently taken her aside to explain that if she works in an office in the immediate area, she should just call the shop & one of the young delivery men will bring the coffee up to her office. Office staff don't have to worry about getting coffee before arriving at the office or spilling on the way, coffee shops' floor space is less crowded, everyone is happy. :Spoiler end.<br/><br/>The one part of the previews that made me think I might like this movie was the speech Meryl Streep's character gives Andy about her blue sweater. This fine bit of writing gave me the impression that this movie had a more intelligent, nuanced and unexpected view on the fashion industry, rather than the usual view that fashion is hopelessly shallow, demands anorexia & self hatred, & is a haven for heartless & vindictive women. Instead the ""sweater speech"" seems to be a page from a different movie that was accidentally slipped into a script that confuses ""comedy"" with serving up the usual cardboard-caricaturing of the fashion industries' alleged politically-incorrect flaws. <br/><br/>It would have been so refreshing to have seen the movie that the ""sweater speech"" actually belonged in.<br/><br/>The only reason I stayed for the entire movie was that I was in a super posh theater with plush recliner seats & waiters serving actual wine."

She very quickly changes from Annie Hall to Jerry Hall. I would tentatively suggest that most male viewers would prefer her as the former rather than the latter. Because this is not actually a true story,she reverts back to Annie in the end and is saved from eternal damnation - phew.

","I'm not a chick flick guy. That may seem like an odd statement, considering they are called chick flicks for a reason, but there are some guys that actually find something to enjoy in the endless reign of female oriented films starring Kate Hudson, Julia Roberts, or the new queen of the genre, Anne Hathaway. With two Princess Diary movies under belt, Hathaway continues her foray into the world of chick film with this adaptation of the best-selling novel by Lauren Weisberger. Hathaway plays Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs, a wannabe journalist who gets a job working as second assistant to Runway fashion magazine's editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). Priestly is the stereotypical mean and nasty boss seen in just about every film made in the past two decades about working. However, Devil Wears Prada is too light hearted to really dive into Priestly's black heart and instead of dark humor to capture Andy's pain working for her, director David Frankel chooses to settle for lame put downs, such as insulting the way Andy dresses. Maybe there's humor to be found in that for women, but it's hard to imagine any guy finding the jokes here humorous. When jokes aren't failing left and right, the filmmakers throw montage after montage at the audience rather than focusing on character development and telling an interesting story. All this makes 'Prada' impossible rubble to sit through with no fun or wit in sight. Worse, the performances are generally annoying and/or dry. Hathaway, a great actress who has been in more bad films than any actress in recent memory, is given little to do but sound whiny and self-centered. Hathaway and the audience deserve better. 1/10"

Like Hitchcock said, you must suspend disbelief here. How a young nerd with literary aspirations finds herself working for the new Diana Vreeland, knowing zip about the rag biz or fashion and making it is just airhead fantasy. Nobody, even with a high IQ, could learn so quickly and be promoted so fast only to discard it all in the end without a sigh. It's just not real. The people aren't real either which is accurate for NYC and Seventh Ave. Everyone is a shark and everyone is mean. Then we have the resident fag who helps our little girl in dis dress, I mean 'distress'. He's actually like Calvin Klein and Halston before they were famous. I worked in NYC in the 70s/80s for Cosmo magazine and the Hearst/Conde Nast empire. There were people like him around. They had all stayed too long at the fair. This character isn't as angry as they were. Anyway, Meryl plays the bitch of the east but no houses drop on her. She's her always impervious self. Just how many roles has she copped from other aging actresses just as capable now? Just because she has a wealthy husband in the business doesn't mean she should eat all the cake. I hate her.

I am wrong - it is backwards. The plot that dominates is the fashion industry and all the ""glitz"" that goes with it - the power, the sycophants, and the overlords. Well, the movie is called ""The Devil Wears Prada."" So the plot really is about the fashion industry of which ""Miranda"" has made herself the leading character.

","The movie was good if you haven't read the book. Meryl Streep as Miranda and Anne Hathaway as Andy were excellent choices for the movie. However the movie took on a completely different message than the book did. I find that the book offered more moral dilemmas than the movie. The book took on more of a role of showing how difficult it is to enter the work world. I enjoyed the plot twist in the book about Lily - in the movie she didn't play an important role. In the book she adds to the moral dilemma that Andy faces while she is in Paris. In the book she is confronted with her best friend having a drinking problem that she didn't notice and then lily got into a car accident while she was in Paris. Giving Andy the difficult decision of whether or not she is going to stay in Paris or go back to see her friend while she was in a coma. This conflict gave way to a new issues with her boyfriend, who's name is Alex according to the book. I enjoyed the books twist more than the movies. The book and the movie are America's 'Bridget Jones'. If you just see the movie it will be a very good movie. If you've read the book you may be disappointed by the movie.

If she had then she would have at least known who Miranda was and she also would have known to make a bit of an effort sartorially (I mean she turns up on her first day in that awful cerulean jumper) ((And seriously who doesn't know how to spell Gabbana)). Also I hate her attitude for the first half of the movie; that everyone at the magazine need to accept her as she is and they are all in the wrong and need to change. She is the one ""invading"" their way of life so why should they change for her?

All important questions, you will agree. For the answers, see ""The Devil Wears Prada."" <br/><br/>Meryl Streep's character in this movie is named Miranda. That is the name of the daughter of the magician Prospero in Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"" (""O, wonder! How many goodly creatures are there here! How beauteous mankind is!"") In a way, Miranda in this movie is also a magician, and surrounded by the cutest elves, pixies, etc., outside of a Hobbit/Hogwarts reunion, she transmutes schmattas (rags) and sequins into treasures, or, rather she transforms the makers of these treasures from dwarfs to giants. She isn't very nice about it, but she isn't very nasty either -- and that's what makes her performance so jaw-dropping good.<br/><br/>Softly, softly, her voice modulating between a whine and a whisper, she holds her followers paralyzed with fear/admiration, and gets her way with a little petulance and a little pouting. This, after all, is the world of high fashion, and inference and understatement will move mountains where threats and high drama will only garner smirks and titters.<br/><br/>Before her withering glance, the rest of the cast can only slink and slither and hope that the gorgon's stare won't turn them into stone.<br/><br/>The movie is funny, the acting very good, and the sets and ambiance capture a certain time and place beautifully.

The movie is based on the book in parts but surly that means they should try to cast someone who at least resembles the personality of Andy Sachs. Anne Hathaway's performance is bland and mind numbingly boring. However in casting Miranda Priestly they were spot on with Meryl Streep, she's stylish yet has an edge to her. The film itself is well shot and is generally enjoyable to watch (if you pretend the lead was actually good) and will make a lot of people laugh however if you are going to turn a book into a film more time should be taken in casting as anyone who actually read the book that Hathaway just isn't Andy Sachs."
"ray-280","1","11","23","8 July 2007"," The Devil Can't Act
","Films like this, and the people who star in them, should thank their lucky stars someone invented the term ""hater."" The word is a get-out-of-jail free card to anyone who wants to walk over others and not have their victory party interrupted by the noise of those they trampled upon. Like few other films could, this film exposes the hypocrisy not in the fashion industry, but Hollywood itself. It also proves, convincingly, that Meryl Streep is the most overrated actress in the history of the civilized world.<br/><br/>Ask Anne Hathaway to do a nude scene, and she'd likely refuse. If she wouldn't, most actresses on her level would refuse. Ask her (or Streep) to play a role that sends the wrong political message about women (say a movie about how to sexually harass women in your office and not get caught), and she might get up on a soapbox and refuse it. After all, actors are such role models, and their films leave such an impression on their audiences. Just ask Geena Davis, who was thrilled to be playing the nation's first female president. Strong, independent women on film send a great message, and the actresses who play them love being the messenger.<br/><br/>When you can call everyone you oppress a ""hater,"" you can marginalize their statements as sour grapes. You can even call them a hater if they fail to be as happy and enthusiastic about your success as you are, even if yours came at the expense of theirs.<br/><br/>That said, would Hathaway revel in the role of a young legal secretary praying she's pretty enough to be hired and dismissing the concerns of the older women she displaced? Is Streep proud that the 20-minute lunch she assigned her assistants violates NY state labor law? Does she like gender discrimination? I guess so, because we all know that actresses won't do things on film if they don't approve of the political message.<br/><br/>Ever wonder why young Hollywood actresses are always smiling so much? Aside from needing to send a biological signal that they just might be ready to have sex (gets them ahead), they are happy because they get paid six or seven figures to play around with these ""important political messages."" While they are doing this, and while movies like this are being made, the stories that really need to be told -- the ones about the people left in the wake of narcissistic dimwits like the leads -- are not, because the ""devils"" in Hollywood don't want that story told, and they don't hire those who can tell it. Instead, they hire the Emilys and Andies of the world, and in the course of mistreating them, destroy the careers of those who never get in their door because they aren't that slither of the population that is young, female, and attractive. Streep was nothing more than a glorified housemom in this film.<br/><br/>Hathaway's ""struggling"" young adult female in New York City is about as unrealistic character as exists. A fat girl who grows up in Manhattan without family money will find herself boxed out of the job market by Andie, while a space has been reserved for Andie all along, by the powerful men who want her socializing near them and working for them. To her credit, Hathaway is not one of those young women herself, in that she did not capitalize on gender bias at regular jobs to keep her in the big city long enough to sleep her way to the top. She's acted all her life and is also a Soprano, i.e., a real performing artist. Her performance may stink theatrically, but politically she's the cleanest of the film.<br/><br/>Streep's character, Miranda Pristley, must have felt like she was in a kennel with all the scenery being chewed by Streep, whose into-the-wall performance smacked of litte more than her industry-induced narcissism that her ""loo droppings"" don't stink. Streep has to be the most annoying actress on- and off-screen of this era. Her character in Defending Your Life is a caricature of the undeserved pedestal the public has placed her on throughout her fourteen Oscar nominations. Those who think Barney is the Devil have good reason, but they're wrong, because Streep is a lot closer than he'll ever be. She takes her paychecks and glory from an industry her characters lampoon. This is like when the media complains about political spending in shows sponsored by high-priced political advertising. Hypocritical.<br/><br/>The film is simple enough: Fashion magazine, queen-bee boss (Streep) hires naive assistant (Hathaway), who barely escapes the sharks before becoming one, proves she can survive, and then wonders if she wants the fruits of her struggle. Stereotype the world and present racist, sexist backdrops (did Manhattan turn into South Africa?) without commentary, while pretending to make a meaningful political statement.<br/><br/>Message to the people in this film: there are no wealthy victims in this world, and there are no wealthy activists. Lip service changes nothing, but putting injustice on film for ""realism"" without showing its ugliness or sparking its eradication is nothing more than profiteering and enabling. But don't worry, anyone who points this out must be a ""hater."" Pristley is Streep's better half, because she's honest about what she is and what she does."

","It's enjoyable to watch high-calibre performers strut their stuff. The calibre of Ms Streep and Mr Tucci is very high. So far so good. They are presented to us here in a world of which we are invited to disapprove. But how can we disapprove of it when it is inhabited by such entertaining star turns? We can only love their world because we love them, and the excellently eccentric young Emily Blunt. We like, but we are less interested in, the pleasant, friendly Ms Hathaway. But her choices are the ones we're supposed to empathise with. We watch her make the approved moral choice. We might even think we would do the same. But the people we enjoy (Streep, Tucci, Blunt) are those whose moral choices are entirely questionable. So at the heart of this movie is a paradox. Or, to put it another way, a cynical lie. Who can blame Streep and Tucci for wanting to be associated with this junk? The parts are good. They play them well. But the fact is that this movie stinks.

I never saw The Princess Diaries, nor did I ever have any desire to, but 'I'm guessing many of the girls who are going to see this movie are fans of Anne Hathaway from those movies and so they were just excited to see her on the big screen again in a non-Brokeback Mountain sort of role.<br/><br/>The jokes and jabs directed at Anne Hathaway's character (Andi) about her ""chubby"" size 6 body were frequent. Eating disorder conversations were abundant here is an example.(I may not get the words exactly right) ""Andi you look so sophisticated"" (Emily, Andis bitchy co-worker) ""Thanks Emily - you look so thin"" ""Oh thank you!!! Its the new diet I'm on, I basically eat nothing until I feel like I'm about to pass out and then I eat a cube of cheese"" Now, if this little conversation happened and then the story went on to make fun of the girl with the eating disorder for the insane-ness of that then fine, satire, I get it...but no, just on to the next bit.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie one of Andi's co-workers, the one who sort of became her mentor said ""So, size 6..."" (this is what he called her) to which she replies ""Not anymore, I'm a four"" and they toast to her success. Never mind that she looked absolutely fine before. And there were no toasts to her career success....only the weight loss.<br/><br/>These comments bothered me on a couple levels...first, they glamorized the world of thin, eat nothing women. Second, who is the target audience for this movie? Women and/or young girls. Isn't there already enough pressure to be think without seeing someone that is admired go from a size 6 (small) to a size 4 (in some cases too small)!??!?!?! Meryl Streeps performance was fantastic. She was fabulous in the role of Miranda Priestly, aka the Dragon Lady. But I am hugely disappointed in both her and Anne Hathaway for participating in a movie that glamorizes eating disorders and adds pressure to the already pressure filled culture that a woman can never be too thin.<br/><br/>I don't know maybe I missed something????"

Just like the series, this was a little too much like New York City and fashion as Hollywood imagines it. Thought Meryl Streep gave the whole business some semblance of class, always a pleasure to watch her. But what predictable mediocrity in story and execution. Not the All About Eve quality one would hope for. I like Anne Hathaway a lot, but wish she would do more substantiate work than this light fluff."

","I have to confess that this movie really was extremely likable, except for its conclusion, which was the worst of the worst kind of hideous schmaltz, and this is what ruined it for me. <br/><br/>Taking the positives then; Streep is fantastic, Hathaway looks great when she's been through the makeover, Emily is very funny and Tucci is very endearing as the art director. The film is sharp and witty whenever it is dealing with the fashionistas, and the world of fashion is well rendered. In fact, it is quit a warm portrayal of the business.<br/><br/>The problem is that Andy Sachs (Hathaway) has a bunch of friends who, deliberately, I guess, are dull and nerdy. They all envy Andy's job, but fail to support her as she presses on with her big break - she leaves parties, she misses her boyf's birthday - and the implication is clear; she's a woman who should be supporting her man and her friends, not the other way round. Eventually Andy gives in to the crass idea that these fair-weather idiot friends are worth pursuing relationships with instead of committing herself to her job. She abandons her prized ambition in some dreadul faux-enlightenment scene in order to work on a crappy newspaper and return to the little goals she had when setting out. If your friends can't accept that becoming the editor of Vogue is a good ambition, and that they should perhaps show some support along the hard path, then you should ditch the friends, not the ambition.<br/><br/>I hate films that set up this ridiculous dichotomy for women. No film like this would ever be made about a man (ironically a similar point is actually made in the film), and no woman should ever be led to the point of view that if your man doesn't like it and chucks you that he's automatically right.<br/><br/>I would have liked this film enormously if Andy had said 'balls' to her 'friends' and proved that bright, intelligent, motivated women can really have it all these days."

"Isaac5855","8","6","11","12 July 2007"," The Only Actress Who Can Command a Movie Screen Without Raising Her Voice Above a Stage Whisper...
","THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is an uneven but entertaining comedy that chronicles the adventures of one Andy Sachs, an aspiring young writer/Plain Jane who inexplicably gets a job as the assistant to the assistant of the editor-in-chief of ""Runway""- a chic, fictionalized New York magazine and how what Andy initially considered to be nothing more than a way to pay the rent ends up becoming her entire life as she becomes immersed in the world of international fashion and the blood-sucking sophisticates and anorexic models who inhabit it. Despite the beautiful packaging of this movie that flawlessly displays the perks of being on the inside of the fashion industry, the screenplay is not terribly original and won't stand up to intense scrutiny. There are plot holes you can drive a truck through...most importantly, Andy is moments away from losing her job after several screw-ups, gets a fashion makeover from one of the designers, and then becomes the perfect assistant? But the movie does have its assets, including effective use of NYC locations, stunning fashions, and a pair of delicious supporting performances from Emily Blunt and the always reliable Stanley Tucci as Andy's less than sympathetic co-workers. Anne Hathaway works hard in the role of Andy...she's a clothes horse and the camera loves her, but something about her performance comes off as forced and affected. But what this film has above everything else, making it worthy of my 8-star rating is the extraordinary, 100-megawatt, dazzler of a starring performance by the amazing Meryl Streep, in the role of a lifetime as editor-in-chief/dragon lady Miranda Priestley. Never in all my years of filmgoing have I seen an actress so completely dominate a movie without ever raising her voice above a stage whisper...Streep is a one woman acting workshop as she effortlessly breathes life into this larger than life character without ever resorting to scenery chewing or any other cheap theatrics that could have creeped their way into this kind of characterization. Streep provides a master class in the art of underplay as she perfectly internalizes the power of Miranda, making every move and sound Miranda makes completely riveting. The fascinating combination of fear and respect Streep fuses into Miranda is the heart of this movie and what makes you not want to miss a minute of what's going on. She makes Miranda funny, terrifying, and tragic from one scene to another with seemingly little effort and just when you think the character is a totally heartless shrew, Streep rips your guts out in one brief scene where Miranda confesses to Andy that her husband wants a divorce. Streep creates one of the mostly richly complex and entertaining characters of her career which, no surprise, earned her an unprecedented 13th Oscar nomination. It is the performance of the divine Meryl Streep that transports THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA from fluffy to fabulous."

","Against my better judgment I watched The Devil Wears Prada. Hoping that it was a proper comedic satire on the fashion industry. But it was just another completely toothless Hollywood hot air balloon.<br/><br/>What we have is an intelligent girl who should know better than to get involved in the industry of supreme shallowness, and she basically eats it up. Like just another bimbo she gets co-opted by the rat race and ends up defending, and relating to, the clearly evil dragon lady editor. That's the most pathetic excuse for a sob story I've ever seen.<br/><br/>So are we supposed to cheer when our main girl finally, after her life has fallen to pieces, sees through the glamour facade and pulls out of it just in time to pursue the life she *really* wants? Puh-lease! Stupid plastered-on, half-hearted happy ending. She didn't *really* learn anything, and neither does the audience.<br/><br/>Everything in this movie is totally cliché. Including that ""intellectual"" circle of friends she meets regularly at the café. None of it rings true at any time.<br/><br/>This movie works as only one thing: an analogy to Anne Hathaway's Hollywood career. A smart, funny, talented actress is chewed up by ridiculous, brainless Hollywood crap and spat out as just another run-of-the-mill pretty face. She should be better than that. I hope she's not totally ruined yet, but that's for the future to show.<br/><br/>3 out of 10."

I didn't warm to her especially, but didn't really need to - as her ""Regular Joe"" role allowed for the eccentricities of her surrounding characters to shine.<br/><br/>Emily's sarcasm and cutting, dry comedic precision was in a word, Britsh. She was excellently cast and deservedly so. I look forward to seeing her in a bigger role very soon.<br/><br/>The male characters are all very attractive and charming - but this is a very female film. The women are powerful, ambitious, successful and above all - fabulous.<br/><br/>Some have criticised the ""wrapping up"" of the Andy and Cliché-nice-boyfriend storyline.

","Though Meryl Streep's acting was magnificent, I quickly got tired of watching her character-- it gets boring getting the vicarious thrill of someone else's meanness. The topic and theme of the movie I found totally superficial and did not grab my attention. For how long can one take jokes about a size 6 being fat and snobbism about clothes? I thought the movie was deadly boring most of the time, the only redeeming moment being when M. Priestly goes through a divorce and has a slightly human aspect for that short interchange with Andy. I guess you could say there was some skill in making some of the scenes, but it was lost due to the absolutely deadly boring content of the movie."

","I've read (or listened to the unabridged audio CD) of the book twice. I eagerly anticipated the release of this movie having already enjoyed Anne Hathaway and of course Meryl Streep in the past. I went to the movies to watch this with a friend who had also read the book. We enjoyed the performances by Hathaway and Streep, but missed some of the things that occurred in the book. Particuraly Lilly -- in the book she was nothing like the character in the movie. In the book, Lilly was a needy person who was a huge source of drama and angst. I missed the doorman at Runway who would make Andy sing for him to gain entrance into the building. In the book you could feel the strain working for Miranda caused Andy much better, there was much more tension. To have filmed the movie like the book was written would have allowed Hathaway to develop more as an actress and that's a disappointment. But like the book, I was rooting for Andy to dump her boyfriend and take up with Christian. Christian fares better in the book as being a descent person. I was hoping as so much of the book had been forsaken in the movie script that maybe my wish would come true, but alas it didn't. Go to the movie. It's a fun summer flick, but for those of you who read the book, be prepared to be a bit disappointed."
"mcdooley","6","4","7","29 December 2006"," Very disappointing, easy populist ending
","The positives...Well, of course Meryl Streep was excellent as always. Even when you can fit her character loosely into a stock type, in this case the Boss from Hell, she manages to add something that's all her own. But Meryl's a given, so we'll move on.<br/><br/>One good thing a movie can always latch onto is when it gives you a behind-the-scenes look at a world that most people don't really know much about but for which a lot of us have stereotypes or preconceived notions. In this case, the world of high power fashion. This kind of thing especially works if it's a world that most of us probably view negatively and I'm guessing most people reading this probably think New York-Paris-Rome high fashion is silly, wasteful, pointless, and even insidious. (and not without reason).<br/><br/>But the ending here...utterly predictable and very disappointing. I guess we're supposed to cheer that our heroine came to her senses and refound her soul and set back on her course to do Good Honest Work among Good Honest Regular Folks. Very safe, very bankable ending. I had been extremely impressed up until the last reel that this was becoming a film about making hard choices and *especially* about letting life unfold for you, despite your best planning, what might be your true authentic calling (or true self) even though it was politically incorrect according to your old peer group, and even though you resisted it and it put you out of your comfort zone at first.<br/><br/>I enjoyed seeing Andy go through her changes at Runway, and to me her old friends looked more and more childish as Andy continued to grow. (Naturally one of those friends was a Sincere Artist.) Of course, clearly we were supposed to be sympathetic with them -- they were the ""old gang"" that Andy, in her ""blindness,"" was gradually losing touch with.<br/><br/>Instead of a fresh take on real character growth, a fresh take on a life's-journey sort of picture, we got the lowbrow, comforting failure ending: Oh it's okay, Andy, you can always come back to us, your real family. We's just simple folks, but we's sincere. This is the sort of ending that caters to people with sour grapes resentment toward, well, successful people.<br/><br/>Question: Why did the director et al. go to such great lengths to surprise us with the recognizably human feelings and frailties of the Runway gang only to then make it supposedly a good thing when Andy ""escapes"" them?<br/><br/>Absolute worst line I've heard in a movie for some time: The idiot boyfriend (I think his name was Dharma Bum, can't remember) at the end, in the restaurant. Andy says something like, gee, I left behind my original dream for...and the boyfriend finishes her sentence by saying ""Shirts. Pants. Purses. Belts."" Or something to that effect. In other words, Andy sold here soul for Mere Material Possessions. Thus sayeth Guru Baba Rum Raisin. (And this dude, by the way, had just announced that he has a job as a major chef in a high-powered Boston restaurant -- gee, no career ambition there, eh?).<br/><br/>Actually a fine film except for the final ten minutes."

Lauren Weinsberger (the author of the Devil Wears Prada) having worked/survived at US Vogue for one year has provided a quite accurate look of madness of the fashion world and the even crazier world of high end fashion magazines.<br/><br/>The movie will make any fashionista laugh and will introduce non experts to some lesser known yet interesting aspects of this world (how a magazine is created and the many conflict of interests behind it....one word ""freebies"").<br/><br/>No wonder Vogue's editor in chief Anna Wintour's bitter reaction clearly showed in the fact that Vogue did not review the movie. And once Mrs.Wintour found out Miranda's office in the movie looked almost exactly like hers (www.oficinadeestilo.com.br/blog/wp-content/office.jpg) she totally redid it. What's pathetic is that her former minion Kate Betts or ""clacker"" as they call Vogue gals in the movie has used the pages of once respectable NY Times to trash the movie and Weinsberger while ultimately sounding pathetic in a blatant case of conflict of interest( Article ""Anna Dearest""). Betts seems to miss the time when she was herself a ""clacker "" at Vogue magazine and probably regrets leaving Wintour all of a sudden in the worst career move ever, having later been fired from her editor post at Harper's Bazaar and now starting from scratch at NY Times."

Comments made about Anne Hathaways' figure were made uncorrected i became much more humorless. I think you'd have to be defected not to acknowledge the flaws of the film petaining to female stereotypes - one can overlook it and see it as a thoughtless stock standard Hollywood film enjoyable for its unmeditative qualities. However I am very concerned about the ""I am now a size 4"" ""well done"" This is an unhealthy statement and it goes uncorrected.

I'm not a skilled enough a critic to judge where the weaknesses are exactly. I haven't read the book, but I would guess script and direction. Meryl Streep performs 100 per cent with the lines provided her. Anne Hathaway is just too good-looking for this part of a clueless, clunky, smart journalism graduate of Northwestern, as she is portrayed to be. Maybe the make-up dept. could have done a better job of ""de-glamorizing"" her."

Compared to some of the mind-bogglingly neurotic, fear-driven, tear-your-hair-out-soon-as-look-at-you women I encountered, some in managerial positions far less 'powerful' than Miranda Priestly's, lemme tell ya, Meryl Streep's character in this movie is almost like Mother Teresa.<br/><br/>I'm sharing the above in case anyone doubts that a boss can be as insufferable as Priestly. Now, to the actual film: <br/><br/>Streep's performance alone is worth the price of admission. Her Miranda Priestly is constructed from the inside out, as all Streep's characters are. It's what she holds back, what she doesn't show but subtly hints at, that gives her character 3-dimensionality and humanity and gains our sympathy without ever asking for it. She is one of those rare actors who is able to convey more with an eyebrow, or by merely pursing her lips, than with an entire page of dialog, and the script here serves her well and vice versa.<br/><br/>What I appreciated most (aside from Streep) is how the movie is superbly restrained throughout - it never turns into one of those over-the-top shriekfests, with hysteria running rampant. I also appreciated how Tucci, who can do no wrong in my book - the Tuccinator, I call him - is never reduced to a cartoon figure; none of the characters are, in fact. Everyone is sufficiently fleshed-out (maybe that's not the choice of words the women in the movie would like, but you know what I mean), and the movie never gets heavy-handed either, even toward the end.<br/><br/>Hathaway is thoroughly believable as ""the new Emily"" aka Andrea aka Andy, an individual who has so much character that she's loyal to her boss even though her boss hasn't overtly earned it. A tricky part, but our girl manages to pull it off, with style to spare."

She's as brilliant as ever, and perhaps more so because this isn't a typical role for her. Emily Blunt also steals every scene she's in and I really look forward to more of her work. Anne Hathaway is just playing herself as always, pandering to the teenage crowd who come to this film only to see Ms. Hathaway become Streep's Galatea, turning from frumpy to Gucci-toting hot mama. The most disappointing message I got, however,was the typical American message to most poor girls out there - if you dress down or unbecomingly, it must mean that you're brighter than the rest.

I mean, yes this happens, but its twisted a little so that the story doesn't really seem that way when you are watching it. <br/><br/>Firstly, there is actual inner conflict instead of shallow characters. Once Andy becomes ""pretty"" she isn't pretty right away and still needs help form Nigel. <br/><br/>Second, the minute she's transformed she's not automatically accepted.

The movie, even though trashed by some critics as ""shallow and unfulfilling"", is sinfully delicious! The key ingredient to the genius and brilliance of this movie is Meryl Streep, one of the best actors in the history of film. She plays the role of the editor-in-chief of the fake fashion magazine, ""Runway"", so well that she makes the entire movie a joy to watch. Add that to the strong performances of Anne Hathaway and (especially) Emily Blunt, as the first assistant to Streep, this movie is delightful to sit through.<br/><br/>Not knowing much about women's fashion, I must say all the clothes, accessories, and style that the women in the movie wear were pretty nice (obviously I'm not a good judge of women's fashion =P). What makes the film shine is the ATTITUDE that each of the people in the fashion industry brings on screen. You'll laugh at the outrageous (and sometimes decadent) indulgences these people have in their clothes and looks, their arrogance, and their contempt for the ""sad people"" who do not understand or care for fashion.<br/><br/>All in all, the story wasn't anything deep, so just go and watch the movie for the great performances and the ""high-class"" laughs that it packs.

","As Meryl Streep has long been known for serious roles - some of them a bit sappy - it was great to see her play the bitchy lead in ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Anne Hathaway plays a young woman who moves to New York and gets a job working at Streep's fashion magazine, only to find that Streep lives an entire existence based on schadenfreude (she's only happy if everyone else is on pins and needles), wants the most impossible things (e.g., the unpublished Harry Potter manuscript) and that the people in the fashion industry are too full of themselves for their own good (they act like they're curing cancer). Unless she can do something to rock the boat.<br/><br/>I think that Streep had some of the funniest lines that I've heard in a long time, namely her whole monologue about cerulean. It goes to show how ridiculous these people in the upper echelons really are, but I also like some of the stuff (oops, ""stuff"" is a forbidden word in fashion!) that Hathaway pulls. Like ""Pret-a-Porter"" and ""Zoolander"", this movie leaves nothing unscathed. You gotta love it as much as I did. It certainly deserved its Oscar nominations.

I thought the movie was pretty funny. Meryl Streep is such a powerful editrix she gets a laugh with a dry eyebrow-raise. Hathaway was a sympathetic protagonist. I kept rooting for her to wake up and realize she's better than everyone around her and needs to quit the magazine now, NOW! Stanley Tucci is really good as the sniping art director who eventually takes Hathaway under his wing so she can survive. I should mention my wife hated it.

","Meryl Streep has the hands which rock the cradle, and no matter how magnificent she is, you can't escape the fact that this script promotes a real wretched view of women in power. Leona Helmsley may have been a piece of work to be employed by, but she got her come uppance through horrid publicity. Streep's Miranda Priestly is a woman who has clawed their way up to the top, and obviously has a hatred towards other women, even though she sees something in naive Anne Hathaway whom she treats with disdain even though she secretly creates plans to help her rise, bringing on ethical issues for Hathaway.<br/><br/>I can see that Streep is having a ball in this part, barking orders and acting more imperious than an empress, tossing her designer coats on Hathaway's desk to hang up without as much as a greeting. A montage of her entrances shows what a wretched, unhappy woman Streep's character is, and in a few moments, unleashes her guard with Anne, eventually coming to depend on her while she crushes Blunt with her thumb. You really have to have nerves of steel to tolerate such degrading treatments, and Hathaway empathizes her vulnerability while never loosing a sense of who she is even though it seems that the world is being handed to her on a silver platter.<br/><br/>Women in business are of a certain mindset and there are those who nurture and those who bully. I've had both, and there really is no justification for the pretentiousness that consumes the industry that this is set in. All this did for me was leave an element of disgust for these archetypes (male or female) who will find their day of reckoning. These are people who are miserable outside of their careers, and along with Streep, there's snooty Stanley Tucci who is the Devil has a pickle puss and Emily Blunt as a walking nervous breakdown. I see these characters every day walking to work on Park Avenue, and am disgusted by the reality as well as the fiction. This is a disappointment because it tries to justify a lifestyle that really needs an attitude adjustment."

There's a scene where she misses her boyfriend's birthday party which is CLEARLY written by a woman -- the situation and the way her boyfriend responds is what women do, not what men do.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is good in it, but she really doesn't have a whole lot to do. She takes an underwritten, one note part, and fleshes it out so it's a chord. (For an example of how NOT to play her part, all you have to do is look at assistant #1 -- she's very poor in the role.) Stanley Tucci's very good, Anne Hathaway does all right.<br/><br/>There's a way to have done this: it could've been anecdotal, like Woody Allen did so well when he didn't really have a story for Radio Days or -- better example -- Broadway Danny Rose. This thing just spins its wheels the whole time.<br/><br/>It's not bad-natured, though, which helps."

","Meryl Streep, you're the coolest.<br/><br/>That said, let's talk about The Devil Wears Prada. The ""takeaway"" for me was that you should shoot for mediocrity and not make uncomfortable choices which could take your (supposedly) adult friends and above all your chunk boyfriend out of their comfort zones. Or, wait, it was that you should be true to yourself and not get wrapped up in some superficial world? No, actually, it was that Anne Hathaway got to breeze through a bi-polar flirty/flustered role, and the only reason the film teeters and totters and flops around is thanks to Meryl Streep. Thank you for completely shredding ""Andy"" about the sweater. There was a moment there.<br/><br/>Just to review, the way to get going in a career is to (A). Get into a position where you can make great connections, make yourself indispensable, and ride the wave to the beach, or (B). Get a lucky break, resist the necessary sacrifices, place your priorities elsewhere, aim low and look for an out? <br/><br/>Ready!?!? The answer is""B""!!!!!!!!!!!!! ""Andy"" does great for herself by following that tried-and-true method and WOW, is she rewarded. She doesn't get her guy, I think (script?), because he's a hot property sous chef moving to Boston. She gets some kind of ""real"" (wow, could go on and on) job, probably writing copy at a ""real"" publication. Just let it end.

","If you have only 80 to 90 minutes to kill before you MUST be someplace else, and are in the mood for a stylish, funny film that is in some ways a valentine to every first job and bad boss in every high powered city in the world (but admitting that few are as high powered as New York), THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a perfect fit.<br/><br/>The film actually clocks in at 109 minutes, but if you are pulled away before the last quarter hour, you may remember it as a minor masterpiece.<br/><br/>The chemistry between top billed Streep as the fashion publisher (in what is, in reality, a strong, flashy but supporting role), Stanley Tucci as the designer, Anne Hathaway as the much put-upon assistant (who is the heart and soul of the movie) and the rest of Manhattan in support is generally outstanding, but - except for a lovely grace-note final quotation from Streep's character delivered by another character - the film as a whole simply ""peters out."" Actually, that ""heart and soul of the film"" is somewhat inaccurate. Hathaway is the heart (with Tucci and the assistant Hathaway is replacing as effective ""pacemakers"") - Streep is the soul. Without her, this film would just be THE SECRET OF MY SUCCESS without the comedy or any Rosalind Russell comedy without Ms. Russell.<br/><br/>Weak finale or not, Aline Brosh McKenna's screenplay is a notable improvement over the bestselling Lauren Weisberger novel it is drawn from. Does one ever know the extent one should credit the director (David Frankel in this case) in a modern film when things go well? I'm inclined to blame him for not finding the punch for the ""final curtain."" In Ms. Weisberger's novel, there was never really any growth in the whining central character. In Ms. McKenna's DEVIL..., the assistant makes the real practical journey most talented people make in their first jobs - learning from tasks and unreasonable circumstances. It makes taking the journey with her fun.<br/><br/>Someone once said that comedy is like sex: if you don't have a climax, someone is going to come away unsatisfied. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is fun but all foreplay."

Anne Hathaway is completely believable as the sweet and smart girl who just happens to land a job with the fashion diva of the century(Meryl Streep).

Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that. <br/><br/>A very enjoyable movie that teenage girls will love as well as their moms. Dads might go along for the ride but it is definitely a chick flick. Meryl Streep is simply fantastic in her mean mean role as the ""super bitch"" of the fashion magazine business. Stanley Tucci is his usual wonderful self as the ""gay"" assistant.

"imnotinsane1","1","5","11","24 April 2007"," Enjoying this movie would make you a sinner!
","Well, where do I even start? Last October, I wasn't allowed to take part in Halloween so instead I had to go with some of my family relatives to see ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Like all movies I go to see, I make the most out of them and try to enjoy them as much as I can. And needless to say, if there's any movie I'd like to burn, it's ""Prada"". Why do I hate this so much? I'd love to say, there's so many reasons why this movie should be avoided.<br/><br/>This movie is mean't to be a Comedy/Drama. Well, they're right about the Drama part but not so much about the Comedy part. This movie just simply wasn't that funny at all and the humour was not only very bland and lifeless but the movie's humour was also quite abusive and sexist (which is surprising for a movie that's aimed at mainly a female audience and yes, unfortunately the sexism is being directed towards women). There's one scene where some of the characters in Runaway Magazine HQ tell Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway) that she is too fat, even if she is obviously not fat in the slightest and in a decade where you see TV news headlines talking about the fact that more and more women are *dying* because they're suffering from anorexia, this sort of stuff being in a movie aimed at mostly young women is completely unacceptable and in a way also encourages more and more young people to falsely bully other people for image problems they don't have, just because they found it funny in a movie like this, also unacceptable for a movie with audiences like ""Prada""s.<br/><br/>Not only that but also, as the movie progresses, it gets less and less funny and it feels as though you're watching a serious drama about divorce and the fickleness of popularity instead of a comedy/drama about a girl trying to do ridiculous tasks to try and get a job for a magazine run by a very bossy fashion expert. And on top of that, the direction of all the scenes involving Runaway HQ and it's editor Miranda (played by Meryl Streep) seem all too familiar to all the scenes involving Cruella DeVil (played by Glenn Close) and her fashion studio in the 1996 live-action remake of the Disney classic ""101 Dalmatians"".<br/><br/>Without exaggeration, this movie was really painful to watch and the worst movie I ever went to a cinema to see so far (even worse than ""Spice World: The Movie"", but not by much). And I wasn't the only person there who hated this movie, all my other family relatives hated it and felt as though the time they spent seeing this movie was wasted. If you're thinking of renting this movie, don't bother. Save your money and your precious time, trust me, you really aren't missing much at all.<br/><br/>I give this movie, 1 out of 5 (or if possible, 0.5)."

","I didn't knew what this movie was about before watching it. I just knew Meryl Streep and Anne Hattaway were in here so I decided to watch it, expecting a fun movie but nothing more. Well, it's true that it's a fun movie, but it's not only this. It tells the story of Andrea (Anne Hattaway), a young girl who wants to be a journalist and she starts as an assistant to Miranda Prestley (Meryl Streep) in one of the most recognized fashion magazines, Runway. <br/><br/>Anne Hattaway gives a great performance, with this feeling of innocence at the beginning, running from one place to another to get the tasks of Miranda done, but at the end she starts to understand what does it means to be in the world of the fashion and it's consequences. But the true star in here is Meryl Streep, who gives a devilish and glamorous performance, but also at parts with a human touch, but only her presence in the movie is worth the watch of it.<br/><br/>Well not only Meryl Streep is what makes the movie worth the watch. Also, I was impressed on the costume designs. How many different dresses they wear through the movie! From Meryl to Anne Hattaway to Emily Blunt or even Stanley Tucci, they all have such a great variety of clothes that will make you keep staring at the movie. This and also the great soundtrack provided by Theodore Shapiro which transmits the feelings of rush and evilness of Miranda, and the innocence and sadness at parts of Andy.<br/><br/>I recommend it to every one who wants to watch an entertaining movie with an awesome performance by Meryl Streep and who wants to discover the price you have to pay for being in the world of fashion and glamour."

","The devil wears Prada (2006) showcases so much talent! Talent from the actors, talent from the writers responsible for the script, and talent from virtually everyone involved in this film. Meryl Streep is absolutely fabulous as Miranda Priestly. Miranda kind of reminds me of Sadie Shelton (Bette Midler) from big business. Streep plays her with deeper meaning though, really gets into the character and there are scenes that give us the opportunity to see into Miranda and understand her as a person versus only seeing her as a tough as nails dragon lady. There is one in particular where she has absolutely no makeup and delivers a wonderfully written and very well executed monologue. It's great to see both the funny and dramatic aspects of this starring character. Anne Hathaway also stars as a young journalist living with her very sweet chef boyfriend. She comes to work alongside Emily blunt as one of Miranda's assistants. She is good in the film and I loved seeing her evolution as a character, she goes on a journey that tells her what's really important in her life. And just like Miranda, Anne's character has her comedic side also. Emily blunt is here and she's hilarious as Miranda's #1 assistant. And let me just say that the coat throwing on the desk part of the movie becomes important later in the movie so pay attention to that. The writing is both funny and touching at the same time and it's all tied together beautifully at the end. 9/10 for the devil wears Prada! A great choice for young teens and up."
"secondtake","7","2","3","4 January 2013"," Four great performances and a dazzling idea--skip the filler and enjoy the best
","The Devil Wears Prada (2006)<br/><br/>There are four and a half major stars here, and any part of this movie with any of them is really fabulous. I'm talking Streep of course, and Hathaway who has the main role. Add Tucci who is terrific (as always) and Blunt who is also terrific (as always) and you have he makings of a terrific movie.<br/><br/>So why the downer reviews and semi-dud status? I don't know, except the other parts without any of these, or with just Hathaway and her friends (her peers including her cute but dull boyfriend) are really dull stuff. This is partly the actors and partly the writing, which is truly filler. I can see some people grabbing their remotes at these points. <br/><br/>But let's get to the crux of the movie, which is actually pretty great fun. The parade of great fashion that whizzes by, the haughty power queen that Streep pulls off with such panache, the steady dribble of insults coming from Blunt's mouth, and the transformation of Hathaway, over and over, as she moves her way into this world are all really dazzling. It's a fairy tale with its feet firmly on the ground--but what odd, worldly, glitzed up ground to be standing on. <br/><br/>There are no depths here, just light romantic comedy. It's a situation many of us know--either by having to look good, or by having an impossible boss, or just seeing a relationship dissolve as you move on in your goals and maturity. Between the dreck there is a mostly wonderful idea made into an intermittently wonderful film."
"Lejink","2","2","3","4 May 2009"," Wardrobe malfunction
","Sorry, not my cup of meat at all, to paraphrase Dylan, a chick-flick based on chick-lit - obviously this was my wife's choice for our Saturday night movie! That said, I really did sit down and try to give the movie every chance to entertain me, I mean I love US TV sit-coms which accomplish comedy by presenting likable characters in humorous situations with quick-fire dialogue and, yes, even gags but this flashy empty so-called rom-com scored zero out of three on that scale.<br/><br/>Instead all I saw was a product placement paradise, so much so that I don't doubt the constantly name-checked contributors probably met the full budget for the film! Impossible you may say to make a film about the fashion magazine business without advertising every other fashion house (was Prada the highest bidder, I wonder?) and magazine chain, but it was so in my face and obvious that it distracted from the fare on the screen.<br/><br/>The characters were all cardboard-thick (the oxymoron is deliberate) caricatures, Meryl Streep getting her ""Analyse This"" make-over to zero effect and Anne Hathaway improbably transformed from geeky, kooky pleb to a made-up, power-dressed woman of today. The characters are too over-exaggerated, not helped by everyone over-acting for all their worth and the plot situations too obviously contrived, despite the true-to-life locations. Hathaway's character, for instance, the (I hesitate to use the word) epicentre of the film and the gal we're all meant to root for, loses all empathy and sympathy with the audience by betraying her ordinary average guy fiancÃ© for a one-night stand with Mr hunky, career-assisting super-journalist in glitzy Paris! I'll just accept that I'm obviously way too far out of the demographics here for the film to connect with me, but, despite being way over 40, happily married and living in Scotland, I still got ""Friends"" a sit-com about single 30-somethings in New York...<br/><br/>A movie as facile and empty as the world it seeks to further glamourise."

Don't worry either if your not into the whole fashion scene, by the end of this film you will be.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep, is this film for sure. Without her amazing skills this movie wouldn't even be half of what it is. By the end of this film you are actually left feeling for her character.

","4 is really the max i can give this film. I had expected so much more from this seeing all the hype that was caused by it. If it wasn't for Meryl Streep this movie would get no more than 1 star. The story is extremely predictable, it's just another one of those safe Hollywood scenario formula's. The excellent cinematography is what makes this movie worth looking, yet, the story is absolutely horrible. Also, there's a chaotic development of characters, such as Andy's friends (where's her family that was mentioned?), they suddenly turn their backs against her, while at least one or two of them could have stuck to being supportive. I was fearing a predictable end, but up to the title roll i still hoped for a surprise; alas, there was none. This movie seems to be typically moralizing, the fashion world is bad, the real journalistic world is good, black vs. white; it's unfortunately a consistent analogy to Hollywood stories on the silver screen. A very simplistic view on our world, which makes this movie nothing more than just a vague sensation, instead of something to ponder about, to make you actually think! I rented the movie, and i will not buy it, as the second time i saw it i couldn't even bear the cheap sentimental muzak blatantly revealing the type of movie to expect. A little girl in a big city, entangled in the merciless web of fashionista's.. but oh dear, at the end she chooses for ""the good"", i was literally crying.. for wasting my time on this. This subject could have embraced so many more dimensions of storytelling, a wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'll go back to watching European cinema again now, as they're a lot less predictive and moralizing."

A severely mentally retarded squirrel would be able to give away the ending after 20-30 minutes into the movie.<br/><br/>There are really NO surprises here at all.

","THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA (2006) *** Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Emily Blunt, Stanley Tucci, Adrian Grenier, Tracie Thoms, Rich Sommer, Simon Baker, Daniel Sunjata. James Naughton. Frequently bitingly funny adaptation of the best-seller roman a clef by Lauren Weisberger about an idealistic young journalist wannabe (Hathaway at her most appealing to date) attempting to make it in The Big Apple as the second assistant to the demanding diva editor- in-chief of a posh fashion magazine (Streep who can chalk up another Oscar nod in one of her best performances in recent memory) - loosely based on Vogue's Anna Wintour - who makes the young charge's life a living hell. Aline Brosh McKenna's screenplay cuts to the bone with its chilly, caricature-border lining skewering of the hoi polloi and TV vet director David Frankel uses montage very well in the storytelling in this curdled fairy tale of ambition and self-respect. Tucci is a dry, wry riot as the acidly funny art director who mentors/ befriends the doe-in-the-headlights Hathaway and Blunt is a blunt weapon of mass destraction as her immediate supervising bitchy superior.

And her chief gives her so many tasks that while watching I understand who is the Devil here. <br/><br/>Despite all the difficulties the main character stays sincere and true to herself.

While so many people envy those who wears fashion clothes and luxury things very few understand how difficult it is necessary to work to get those things.

","Despite this movie had tremendous success and stardom, I must confess that I was avoiding this flick through the years. Somehow I built the image, and the marketing around it helped, that this would be a very empty, futile, pointless experience and that I will learn nothing useful. I was wrong. This can be very relatable, namely the office emotional abuse by an authoritarian and disrespectful boss, the jealousy of a close colleague, and the everyday struggles of a young well educated woman in this century. I also really need to emphasize the stupendous acting performance by Maryl Streep has Miranda Priestly, the very real arrogant boss. When she realizes that she needs Andrea's dedication, commitment and competence to make her life function almost and every day, she finally sees her worth. But this time Anne Hathaway character go forward with her professional ambitions and finds a new job, in the traditional journalism area where she belongs."
"ElMaruecan82","7","1","1","15 March 2015"," And the Emperor Wears Nada ...
","Indeed, how could a movie so in-line with the world of fashion be so old-fashioned in its overall plot line? <br/><br/>One redeeming quality though is that beyond the fashion facade, ""Devil Wears Prada"" pays a powerful tribute to all these authoritarian figures we spent time hating in mind privacy before realizing how enormous their contribution to our lives were... that there will be a 'before' and an 'after' them.<br/><br/>I had a teacher like that in Prep school, constantly squeezing out the best of my potential, and the hardest way. I remember standing during four hours correcting an exam, enduring all the year her ""this is pathetic"" comments... until that magical day where I was prepared and all she could say was ""very good"" leaving everyone in the amphitheater jaw- dropped.<br/><br/>I never had anyone like that in my life again, and if I had, maybe my internship in a famous cosmetic company, so close in-universe to the Runway magazine (the Vogue ambiance fictionalized in the film), would've ended more positively. To some extent, this film opened my eyes and its premise and Meryl Streep's performance make the most effective aspects. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the rest of the film consists on a succession of clichés that didn't befit its ambitions, and the actors aren't to blame. As the editor of Runway Magazine, Miranda Priestley, Meryl Streep can get away with everything. Even if she looks like Cruella De Vil's hidden sister,<br/><br/>you can see in her eyes, a hint of tiredness or compassion that gives a subtle note of three-dimensionality underneath the usual villain's archetypes. <br/><br/>Similarily, even Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel, one of the most overused job trends as the effeminate gay designer, is convincing, so is Anne Hathaway as the naive rookie who learns the ropes... almost. She gives the first wrong signal when her carelessness to the world of fashioned is exaggerated by her ridiculous clothes, something begging to inspire the most excruciating mockeries, before the 'dramatic change', naturally.<br/><br/>I remember in ""Miss Congeniality"", despite a cinematic knowledge younger of 15 years, I didn't buy the way they tried to make Sandra Bullock masculine and I saw a sexy walk in a sexy dress coming one mile away. And when you have a 5'8 girl like Anne Hathaway with a lovely face, no matter how desperately you try to hide it, the 'dramatic change' doesn't share the same surprising impact than Olivia Newton- John in ""Grease"".<br/><br/>And why did she change anyway? To show that just because her appearance changed, competence and competitiveness would follow? I guess I could have accepted it but her style wasn't even in the accused box, in a quite well-written scene, Miranda Priestly explains the flashy history of the so-called casual clothing. A little contradictory but let's say it was the first step for Andrea aka Andy aka Miranda's new slave... I mean, assistant, to take her job seriously. Fair enough.<br/><br/>Then, came the crucial ""Harry Potter"" episode when she couldn't bring the manuscript so she decided to give up, and her boyfriend, a cook, was okay with that. Then, she realized her efforts paid off when a contact gets her the precious pages. Fine. Why doesn't she say that to her boyfriend, instead of ""finally, I realized I shouldn't give up"" leaving up the very details that could convince him that maybe she's fit to the job. <br/><br/>That's what the film lacked more, a realistic antagonism and there were so many to chose : the friends could've been interesting dream-killers, but then fashion wasn't Andy's dream anyway, she wanted to be a journalist, but why not making it her dream ? It's an adaptation or Lauren Weisberger's best–selling report of her experience with Anna Wintour, but why not taking even more distance if it's worth spicing up the story. <br/><br/>And how about Emily the co-assistant? Emily Blunt was noticed for her supporting performance, but more could've been done with her. She starts as a mean bitchy jealous, then she seems to help her and then, well, as motivated as she was to travel to Paris, she makes an effort to screw everything by appearing sick, snoozing on Miranda and forgetting a guest's name. <br/><br/>Of course, she gets fired, why should Andy be surprised, if one thing, Emily dug her grave. Yet Andy feels guilty but then Emily bumps into a car and can't go to Paris anyway. Emily was written to be a rival, a mentor, a pro, a failure, a comic relief yet in each role, she was severely under-characterized. And under-characterization is symptomatic of what is wrong in the film.<br/><br/>Andy's friends are written as reactive people who noticed how she changed, they didn't serve any other purpose than injecting some guilt in Andy's heart, while in the main time, the film makes us feel that she's making progresses, yet it should be wrong and we never know who is supposed to be right, Andy, Miranda or the friends? And the friends are so unlikable that we don't even want to agree with them. We loved Gordon Gekko as a mentor but we still found him despicable. There's nothing to root for here, except Andy.<br/><br/>She's doing great and Miranda seems to appreciate her efforts, everything is paying off and then, in the laziest bits of screen writing, we're supposed to 'realize' with Andy, that this isn't the kind of job one should dream of because it makes you hurt your friends. And nothing rung falser than that phone she threw in a Parisian fountain. <br/><br/>To some extent, I guess it disappointed me because it reminded of that internship. I gave up happily but I gave up nonetheless."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","1","1","11 July 2014"," Surprisingly subdued, but unremarkably so.
","The Devil Wears Prada has always been claimed one of those 'good' chick-flicks, in a crowd with films like Mean Girls where they appeal to a broader audience. I was willing to give it a go since I liked the cast but unfortunately the film treads so lightly that it doesn't seem to break free of average. Granted, it doesn't tend to make any mistakes that other chick-flicks in its mould would do, and to call it a chick-flick is misleading as that implicates romance and comedy. It has them, but in short supply. It's a drama, and that's fine though unexpected on my behalf, but it doesn't seem to have much drama to it either. Its strongest item in its wardrobe is the reliable and colourful production and costume design. Streep, Hathaway and Tucci are good and effortless but unremarkable even at their best. Perhaps I was expecting something else but The Devil Wears Prada is merely solid and disappointedly subdued as it's not insightful or personally identifiable enough to work as a straight drama. At least it's not as juvenile as it could be.<br/><br/>6/10"
"JamesHitchcock","7","1","1","30 April 2009"," A Russian newspaper? A Madrid art gallery?
","I am probably not the right demographic for ""The Devil Wears Prada"". I have little knowledge of the fashion industry, and even less interest in it. Apart from one or two obvious big names like Versace and Christian Dior, about the only fashion designer I could name would be Karen Millen, and then only because she comes from the same town as me. Until I saw the film recently I didn't even know what the word ""Prada"" meant. (A Russian newspaper? A Madrid art gallery?) In fact, it is an Italian fashion house whose products are, apparently, endorsed by the Prince of Darkness himself. (Is the title a piece of product placement on behalf of both Prada and the Church of Satan?) The main character is Andrea Sachs, a young college graduate with ambitions to become a journalist. Although she is about as knowledgeable about fashion as I am, the only job she can find is as junior personal assistant to Miranda Priestly, the editor of a prestigious and influential New York fashion magazine. (Andrea would much rather work as an investigative journalist, preferably for a publication with a left-wing bias. More Pravda than Prada). At first, she fits in poorly; she is not just ignorant about fashion but is positively contemptuous of the fashion industry, which she sees as snobbish, trivial and irrelevant. She is generally referred to by the normally masculine diminutive ""Andy"", which might suggest that she is not a girl who places a high premium on femininity. The rest of the magazine staff, especially Miranda's British senior assistant Emily, mock her on account of her plain, unfashionable dress style. Miranda herself, an icy snob, constantly humiliates her and orders her to perform menial tasks such as fetching her coffee. (Apparently the budget of ""Runway"" magazine does not stretch to a kettle; in another piece of product placement we see Andrea going out to buy coffee from Starbucks).<br/><br/>Gradually, however, Andrea comes to terms with her new job, especially as it brings with it many perks, including free designer clothing and foreign travel. She begins to dress more stylishly and do her job competently, winning grudging praise even from the formidable Miranda, especially after she succeeds in fulfilling Miranda's seemingly impossible (and probably illegal) request to obtain a copy of an unpublished ""Harry Potter"" manuscript. (Miranda's young daughters are great ""Harry Potter"" fans). A crisis comes, however, when Andrea's relationship with her boyfriend Nate begins to suffer because of the long hours she has to devote to her work. The two eventually split up after an argument in which Nate accuses her of becoming the thing she once despised.<br/><br/>This film has some similarities with the Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle, ""View from the Top"", another film about a young woman who, after initial setbacks, achieves success in her job, but then finds that she needs to choose between her job and her boyfriend. In both cases the message seems to be that success in one's love life is more important than success in one's career. It is notable that the bitchy Miranda takes quite the opposite view- she can alienate husbands just as easily as she alienates members of her staff, and is currently going through her fifth divorce.<br/><br/>""The Devil Wears Prada"" could easily have ended up as no more than a glossier version of ""View from the Top"", which is a fairly mediocre comedy. What saves it is some excellent acting. In the earlier film, Paltrow just seems to be going through the motions; in one interview she herself implied that she only took the part for the money. Whereas Paltrow's Donna was simply a go-getting career girl, Andrea is a more complex character, well acted by the lovely Anne Hathaway as a wide-eyed, innocent idealist who finds her idealism under threat from the subtle temptations placed in her way by a woman who has (metaphorically if not literally) sold her soul to the devil.<br/><br/>Hathaway receives good support from Emily Blunt as the catty Emily and Stanley Tucci as Nigel, the magazine's kindly Art Director, one of Andrea's few colleagues to offer her support. (Despite Nigel's obvious effeminacy, it is never made clear whether he is actually gay- a surprising stance given Hollywood's normal liberalism on this subject). The real star, however, is Meryl Streep. I have never been an adherent of that school of thought which holds that Meryl cannot do comedy, as I liked her in ""Death Becomes Her"" and even ""She-Devil"", a film for which few critics had kind words, even if it did bring her a Golden Globe nomination. ""The Devil Wears Prada"", however, provides her with her best comedy role. The monstrous Miranda Priestly- silver-haired, immaculately dressed, snobbish, supercilious and icily self-possessed- is a magnificent comic creation. Her surname suggests that she is a sort of high priestess of the fashion industry, and she revels in her power, knowing that an unfavourable mention in her magazine can destroy the career of a designer. She always speaks softly, never raising her voice, because she knows that she can inspire fear with just a whisper. Streep's performance brought her a record 14th Oscar nomination, although she lost yet again, this time to Helen Mirren for ""The Queen"".<br/><br/>It is something of a convention that monstrous characters in comedies should be revealed to have a vulnerable or human side. Here, however, that convention is played with and subverted. We think we have discovered Miranda's vulnerability when she seems to be in danger of losing her position to a rival whom she detests. And then, suddenly, we see that Miranda has been in charge all along and is able to see off the threat with a characteristic piece of double-dealing. It is a great moment and one that Streep makes the most of. Despite my lack of interest in its subject matter, this was a comedy I enjoyed. 7/10"
"imdb-21100","8","1","1","19 January 2009"," Dance with the Devil in Prada
","A delightful excursion through the world of haute couture and magazine publishing set amid glamorous Paris and New York. The film is an adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-seller, which was based on the life of Anna Wintour (Editor-in-Chief of the U.S. edition of Vogue).<br/><br/>Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) seems a fish out of water when she interviews for a job as the second-assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), editor of high fashion magazine, Runway. Andy wants to be a journalist, and is only working there to survive until she gets a break for her writing.<br/><br/>Miranda Priestly: ...You have no sense of fashion...<br/><br/>Andy Sachs: I think that depends on...<br/><br/>Miranda Priestly: No, no, that wasn't a question.<br/><br/>But Andy is smart, though at first naive, and after being hired, she tries hard to please the devil in Prada, Miranda. Pleasing Miranda, however, is quite a challenge. Completely self centered, she makes impossible demands such as a flight out of Florida during a hurricane, or the unpublished manuscript to the latest Harry Potter book for her twins. Streep is the consummate bee-otch delivering such lines as:<br/><br/>Miranda Priestly: Find me that piece of paper I had in my hand yesterday morning.<br/><br/>Miranda Priestly: By all means move at a glacial pace. You know how that thrills me.<br/><br/>Miranda Priestly: Details of your incompetence do not interest me.<br/><br/>Contrast this Ice Queen with the laid back character she played in Prairie Home Companion, and you begin to get a sense of this actress's extensive range. This role earned her an Oscar nomination. Well deserved, I might add.<br/><br/>First-assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) would be only too happy to sabotage Andy, but if she were fired just now that would dash her dreams of attending the fashion events in Paris. Lots of catty comments from her. My fave: <br/><br/>Emily: Okay, I am hearing this... (She moves her hand in a speech mimicking sign) <br/><br/>Emily: And I want to hear this. (She closes her hand) Can't wait to use that one.<br/><br/>Art Director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) gives an excellent performance, mentoring the ingénue, without ever losing his satiric edge or giving in to the saccharin. Upon first seeing her he dashes off the following withering remark: Nigel: Who is that *sad* little person? Are we doing a before-and-after piece I don't know about? When she turns to him, after a particularly cruel session of torture from Miranda, instead of sympathy he tells her bluntly that she disrespects the Art of Fashion, the role of the magazine, and the impact of Miranda upon that Art.<br/><br/>Nigel: Other girls dream of working here. You merely deign.<br/><br/>Later, after seeing that Andy is smart and capable, and trying to meet the challenges of her job, he gives her a pair of Jimmy Chu high heels. She tells him they are not for her, but soon after when Miranda glares at her sensible shoes, she puts them on Tout de Suite. This is a turning point for her character, who finally gets in the game, embracing the world of fashion, and dances with the devil. Andy is now known as Andrea, and she finally gets some good barbs of her own, such as when sexy writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker, currently starring in The Mentalist as Patrick Jane) attempts to seduce her in Paris: Christian Thompson: Je suis très, très désolé. Andy Sachs: You're not that désolé at all.<br/><br/>Director David Frankel (who was also responsible for Sex in the City) exhibits the same witty dialogue--the same heady mixture of comedy and drama, or dramedy and comma--that will keep you entertained right up to the final dénouement. Pour yourself a Peach Cosmo and watch this with your own Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte."

","Yeah, I know - I'am a guy who actually read the book - fat lazy Russian who's even further from the fashion world than Anne Hathaway's character at the beginning. The only excuse - it was my wife's, and it was dull. <br/><br/>But as for the film - it has one thing book haven't got, one and only Miranda - Meryl Streep. Her performance boosts this otherwise walk- through movie from 5 to 8 stars in my opinion. If you want a flick on fashion - go see Altman's ""Prêt-à-Porter"", which is brilliant, actually. But if you want to see the Dragon Lady herself - look nowhere else. She's just like Al Pacino in ""Devil's Advocate"" - charismatic, stylish and... complete."

I had decided to watch it because I had heard Meryl Streep gave a very good performance in it (hey, it got her nominated for an Oscar after all) and both my mom and my sister really liked it. Yes, I know what you're thinking right now--what I was doing, trusting my mom and sister on a movie about fashion? Well, truthfully, I didn't know what myself I was doing.<br/><br/>It's a good movie. It's anything but great. The acting is a huge highpoint, though, I can't think of one actor or actress in the movie who didn't do a terrific job. I remember seeing Anne Hathaway in her premiere film role, The Princess Diaries, a million and one years ago. I hadn't seen her act on screen since so that was kind of fun. Meryl Streep definitely deserved her Oscar nomination, and Stanley Tucci never fails to amaze me.<br/><br/>Well, I don't know, maybe it's just because I'm a guy, I'm not into fashion at all, and I believe one should just wear whatever the hell they want and not care what they look like. Seriously. But anyway, it's a fun movie and it teaches a good lesson, that there's more to a person than the outside. Good, not great."

","If you can tolerate the silliness heaped within in the first half hour or so, this comedy/drama settles down after that and becomes quite watchable. And it is a fabulous vehicle for Meryl Streep, who will undoubtedly receive an Oscar nomination for her turn as the acerbic, tyrannical editor of the leading women's fashion magazine in America, an executive who scrupulously lives out Teddy Roosevelt's dictum to walk softly and carry a big stick.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough. Andy Sachs, (Anne Hathaway), a freshly graduated journalism star at Northwestern, comes to the Big Apple to seek her fortune as a writer and lands a job as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (Ms. Streep), the Queen of Hearts in fashion journalism. Andy struggles to please the unsatisfiable Ms. Priestly, who seems to quietly relish every opportunity to break everybody's balls on the premises. In the process Andy loses the affections of her friends and lover. When she has passed all of Priestly's sadistic little tests and gained a promotion to top assistant, she finally is in a position to see her boss's foibles in a clear light, and we know in a flash that redemption lies just around the corner.<br/><br/>The silliness early on is twofold. First, Andy comes to work looking like a college freshman dorm rat, oblivious to proper dress and grooming standards for work at a fashion mag. Nuh, uh. Sorry. If she's as smart as touted, she would not be that clueless. Her subsequent instant makeover into glamour queen merely underscores the stupid conceit of her initial frumpiness. Second, when the call comes in that Queen Priestly is arriving early for work (the point at which we first meet her), everyone on the staff  and there are scores of people  frantically dashes about cleaning up the trashed mess of paper, coffee cups, and general disarray so all is pristine when the Queen arrives. Again. Nuh, uh. Never happen. If Priestly's demand for decorum is that fierce and exacting, the place would never suffer the entropy we witness for even a moment.<br/><br/>These conceits are old fashioned, ham-handed Hollywood stuff. Scenes you'd never see in a European treatment of the same story. Scenes that cheapen an otherwise decent movie. With Adrian Grenier as Andy's boyfriend and Stanley Tucci as Priestly's chief designer, the best thing I've seen him do since his role as Secondo in Big Night. Hope he gets a supporting Oscar nomination. (The English actress Emily Blunt is miscast here as the assistant Andy displacesBlunt acts well enough but lacks the glamour for this role.)

"MOscarbradley","5","1","1","17 October 2006"," Coping with a chipmunk
","This extremely handsome but ultimately mediocre 'comedy' is like a poor girl's version of ""Sex and the City"", (where ""Sex and the City was ballsy at best, this is insipid). It's a wish-fulfillment fairy-tale about the poor girl holding on to her integrity when she's offered the moon by the Devil herself, like Dorothy standing up to the Wicked Witch of the West, and it's virtually plot less. It's just a series of vignettes leading up to the killer-punch; the Ice Maiden melts, (a little), and Dorothy goes back to Kansas.<br/><br/>In the central role of Andy, the girl who doesn't sell her soul, Anne Hathaway seems to have one facial expression, (imagine a chipmunk trying to look sincere). She is goodness personified so you can't root for her because her future has been mapped out for you as soon as the movie starts. Instead you're drawn to the posh, dippy comedy caricature of a secretary played by Emily Blunt who is so good an actress she gives this pathetic character a kind of depth and she steals all her scenes.<br/><br/>The men, (Adrian Grenier, Simon Baker), are gorgeous and vacant. Grenier is the dark-skinned good guy and Baker is the blonde villain, (that way you can tell them apart). Stanley Tucci is in there, too, but he doesn't qualify as 'totty' because he's the token gay guy on the magazine. We know he's gay because Tucci plays him fey. It would be appalling were Tucci not so good an actor, (and what happens to him is pretty appalling).<br/><br/>As for the much vaunted performance of Meryl Streep, it's serviceable at best. Miranda can never be more than a cartoon character, a Cruella DeVille in nicer clothes. Streep eventually brings her to life but it looks like hard work, and she gets no help from the script which feeds her up stock situations until we are finally meant to empathize with her. (Can that be a crack in her armour? Is goofy-faced Andy finally wearing her down? In reality, Miranda would stab Andy through the heart with a stiletto). It's not a terrible picture and it's certainly not drab. Florian Ballhaus's, (son of Michael), brilliant photography ensures it looks expensive, but it's not funny, it's certainly not clever and when it's over you don't feel like you've seen anything at all."

The plot is oh-so typical: girl enters the big city, has a shot at a good job, needs to throw some elbows, ends up neglecting her social life/friends/boyfriend. At the end, girl decides her new life really isn't what she wanted, and throws it all away again. *snore* <br/><br/>Did I miss anything? Well, Meryl Streep was okay. She played her role as boss-from-hell perfectly. It's probably the only reason not to give this movie a 1.

","I went to see this film last night after reading a few favorable reviews and having had several people told me that they were surprised that they enjoyed it. (Reasons for going - Had to - the GF wanted to see it. It was the only film playing at the time we were there. Wanted to get out of the heat and sit in the air conditioning. etc.) The simple fact is that The Devil Wears Prada is a lazy, sloppy effort by a lot of professionals who know the ""basics"" of film-making and shot more like a long form music video than an actual film. There is no dramatic tension at all, and in the case Anne Hathaway's character no discernible character arc at all (and it's her story). Unless you consider Anne's Andi character starting out nice and ending the film being really nice.<br/><br/>The sad thing is there are so many chances to torn this film into something really entertaining but it seems like everyone was so concerned with making everyone look good that they just avoided it. And the critics who have been raving about Streep's performance are either A. In denial B. Paid off by the studio or C. Drinking the Kool-Aid. Seriously, I guarantee there were probably ten people on the production crew who were scarier bosses than Streep's Miranda. Most people would kill to have a boss as nice as Streep is. I mean really, she's impatient about her coffee order and takes Andi to big shows and a trip to Paris. Ooooow - scary! The bottom line is this - if you watch Gap ads on TV and wished they could go on for an hour and a half - then this movie is for you. Hathaway is a pretty young woman and she looks good in high end clothes. I'm still not sure if she can act, but then I can't tell if Adrien Grenier can act either. And it isn't their fault - it's the script and the director.<br/><br/>The thing is - this is one of the best films Hollywood put out this year - and it isn't very good. And worst of all - they didn't even try to make it good. Because it wouldn't have been that hard to do. It just would have required a little effort."

","Today I went to the Broadway Mall in Hicksville where my husband and I ate a big lunch at the food court just before heading to the movie theater adjacent to the food court. We took our seats a half hour before ""The Devil Wears Prada"" came on and were the first ones there. Then came groups of women after women, and I felt that my masculine-minded husband would be obviously uncomfortable at a chick flick where he could have been the only man in the theater. And he was while watching the movie with a blank stare on his face. But wait. Before showtime, two other men came along, and they were elderly men with their wives who wanted to see the movie. My husband was really the only young man in the theater. All the other patrons were women who felt it was better to leave their husbands or boyfriends at home, or groups of teenagers. During the movie, there was barely any laughter in the audience.<br/><br/>I never read the book, and I am not so much a fan of ""Chick Lit,"" but I thought that ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was going to be a funny, sexy, fast-paced, smartass ""Chick Flick"" in the tradition of ""Death Becomes Her"" (That starred Meryl Streep as well in a wickedly funny comic performance as a self-centered 40ish actress working well opposite Goldie Hawn, the queen of funny middle-age chick flicks) and ""The First Wives Club"" (again with Goldie Hawn, taking it all as a faded screen diva). Instead we see Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway playing blunt, expressionless women in a slow-paced vehicle which makes good use of New York and Paris cinematography, but nothing else.<br/><br/>Streep as Miranda Priestley, the Cruella De Vil-type editor in chief of ""Runway"" and Hathaway as Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs, a Northwestern University graduate and Miranda's newest employee, don't shout insults or go head-to-head against one another at all in this movie. Occasionally, Miranda will throw down fancy clothes at the preppily dressed Andy on her desk. Miranda takes terrible advantage of Andy. So does Emily (British actress Emily Blunt), the first assistant of Miranda. Then Emily suffers her fate from job stress by getting hit by a cab, leaving Andy for the difficult task as working with Miranda in Paris for the most important fashion week of the year.<br/><br/>Being the good girl she is, Andy does everything she can to please Miranda to keep her job to the point of getting two manuscripts of a Harry Potter book for Miranda's young twin daughters. Andy's friends and boyfriends are put off by the sudden change of Miranda from size six preppy clothes to her size four glam model outfits. That leads to a friendship with a guy from a rival fashion magazine who has a crush on her, and although they don't kiss, she and her regular boyfriend temporarily break up. Also breathing over Andy's shoulder is Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Runway's obsequious fashion director, who encourages Andy to be a slave to Miranda and also does everything to please Miranda as well. No matter how well one does a job for Miranda, it's just not enough.<br/><br/>So do not expect any physical comedy, quick-witted quips, hair-pulling, bickering or any other banter. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a very quiet, almost too quiet, nap inducer where Streep and Hathway show emotions internally rather than externally and act very suppressed. In the movie ""Nine to Five,"" Dabney Coleman was a devil of a boss who really let it hang out, and all of Coleman's nasty characters do just that. Not Streep as Miranda Priestley. She would talk in a flat monotone and get orders out more subtly. Also in ""Nine to Five,"" Jane Fonda, Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton were the secretaries who'd loudly wreak merry vengeance on Coleman, their meanie boss. Hathaway, a soft-spoken actress who stars in many gal movies, would act submissive and then leave her. As the proverb goes, ""Living well is the best revenge.""<br/><br/>I did look at my husband from time to time to see if he would fall asleep. He didn't, but he would stare at the screen with a blank stare and his eyes looks as though he could fall asleep and snore. I didn't fall asleep, but I found myself yawning in spots. No wonder such guys like my husband should be left at home from slow moving ""Chick Flicks.""<br/><br/>""The Devil Wears Prada"" may sound like a spark-flying sitcom, but it is really plays like a TV dramedy."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Having not read Lauren Weisberger's best selling novel, I am not sure whom to credit with the terrific dialogue and sparkling one liners throughout the film. There are some doilies! As if there were any doubts, this movie belongs to Meryl Streep (how can there be any debate that she is the greatest working actress of our time?). If one was not familiar with her staggering resume, recognizing that this is the same woman singing into a microphone in the recently released ""A Prairie Home Companion"" would be impossible. Ms. Streep is the master of her craft and is simply mesmerizing on screen. Studying the details of her performances should be where every actor wannabe starts their training. Streep complements her stream of non-stop dialogue with facial gestures and body language that convince you she is Miranda Priestly. By the way, her character is a cross between Cruella DeVille and Gordon Gekko - not the most likable or accessible personality one could design.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is fine, although doe-eyed Anne Hathaway gets pretty much chewed up and spit out in her scenes with Streep. Probably what the casting director had in mind. Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt (as the real Emily, not the new Emily) really add some punch to their roles and Simon Baker (L.A. Confidential) and Adrian Grenier (Entourage) add eye candy for the ladies - as if the shoes, clothes and accessories aren't enough.<br/><br/>What keeps the film from reaching the next level is simply the direction of David Frankel. His TV background is obvious as most every scene as the feel of a ""Sex and the City"" episode and not a full blown Hollywood movie. The same material in a true movie director's hands would have been a step up.<br/><br/>Can't help but mention, from a guy's perspective, that there is more lipstick in this movie than in the movie ""Lipstick"". Make-up, hair, jewelry and clothes are overdone to the point of being laughable. Again, it's all part of the show, but it does help to point out what a joke the fashion industry plays on women every year."

Even my wife who normally likes slushy films or even stuff on the B movie channels couldn't stomach this and she asked me if we could go..Another interesting point is that the definition on the screen was poor.

","In brief, Meryl Streep plays Miranda Priestly a big-time fashion magazine editor and Anne Hathaway, who has no fashion sense at all, manages to get a job as her second assistant. Emily Blunt plays her first assistant. There are a few love interests, mentors, and wheeling and dealing scenes thrown in for good measure but the movie is essentially about the interaction between Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. Sounds a bit lame, and it would have been were it not for Meryl Streep. She plays her role so perfectly that you can't imagine anyone else could even come close. Meryl Streep has truly created a movie icon worthy of an Oscar.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway puts in a terrific performance and Emily Blunt, apart from being very pretty, adds just exactly the right amount of comic relief without being a caricature to make it all work. Blunt's facial expressions were so spot on and timed to perfection that they had everyone in the theater in stitches.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie, specially for the women in LA who have about as much fashion sense as any $20 color-blind hooker with massive silicone implants and a cellphone surgically implanted into her skull."

","I thoroughly applaud THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA for several reasons:<br/><br/>1) it had what i consider to be a brilliant screenplay with amazing dialogue. 2) MERYL STREEP. nothing more needs to be said here. 3) Emily Blunt. she really did look like she was full of virii, and yet a sympathetic character. 4) Stanley Tucci. He grew on me. What a sweet heart. Like a bitchy version of Hector Elizondo from Pretty Woman.<br/><br/>i dare to say that the models in those astounding clothes made America's Next Top Model seem like try-outs for Walmart. Kinda cruel to say, but there it is. Is there any role that the divine Streep cannot do with complete credibility? In this shallow, superficial world of ""fashion"", she manages to give a complex and many-layered performance which leaves me without adequate words to describe. Anne Hathaway's character loses her way for a time, and loses herself, although she looked beautiful on the outside in those fabulous clothes. She plays her usual sweet self, which was fine; but i preferred her cold turn in BBM. The people she worked with were twisted and yet very human. And yes; she had a choice. Ultimately, she chooses her own path. The one detail i didn't find convincing was her partnership with Adrian Grenier, who looked like he was trying out for lead actor in a prehistoric film about early man. I didn't buy them as a couple. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA captured my interest and held it through out right to the end. Yes; it is a ruthless and completely shallow world, but it is peopled with very real humans who have chosen to go along. I've seen these kinds of endings before; but nothing is truly original...except perhaps the absolutely divine Meryl Streep. I watched this film twice, the first time at Waterton Parks, a beautiful place where the highlight was watching this film in it's small theatre amongst the breath taking surrounds. If anyone can upset the brilliant performance by Helen Mirren, it's Meryl. It's not going to happen, but it wouldn't bother me at all if she did. The DVD version had some technical problems with the sound. But it didn't detract from Streep. Not one bit. A stunning performance by one of the best actors of our generation."
"simon_abbass","10","4","9","31 January 2007"," Why Meryl Streep should get the Oscar
","To say Meryl Streep doesn't deserve an Oscar for her performance As Miranda Priestly is ludicrous at best. She brings a fluid motion to Miranda most of us would like to be able to achieve in our own lives. But what grabs hold of you and makes you sympathize with Miranda is at that moment she discusses with Andy about her second husband's departure from her life and how it affects her. All of a sudden I felt myself feeling her loss. Miss Streep's ability to make you believe she is the one of the characters she portrays tells me she is more than a performer; she is an entertainer, a person who through her tremendous talent has allowed me to forget my troubles for the length of this film. The entire film from start to finish was well put together. All aspects from music, lighting, camera angles, cinematography, costumes, even makeup were sewn together in this perfect dance."

Yes, life at a magazine is undoubtedly awful, stressful, people being mean and cruel, but everyone? Come on. So Hollywood and over-the-top. If you can last through this movie, good luck. I did; mom slept. It is so unnerving to watch ""civilized"" people act so horrible to one another. Hey, I don't need movies where everyone is happy and kind all the time (although that's a pretty good premise), but this is painful and difficult to sit still for. Money paid, we stayed.

"Metronome11","7","4","9","2 July 2006"," A fiendishly clever casting decision
","Meryl Streep plays Miranda Priestly, the dictatorial editor of Runway Magazine (loosely based on Anna Wintour, the legendary editor of Vogue) against Anne Hathaway as her young, lovely, naive, underpaid, and overworked second assistant. The two of them carry the story with supporting cast (ably led by Stanley Tucci) and walk-ons by major designers. A must-see for anyone in the fashion or luxury goods industry.<br/><br/>I found it highly entertaining, with numerous witty remarks, and the audience laughed with me. Andrea Sachs (Hathaway), a recent journalism graduate, shows up to interview for the personal assistant job having never heard of Ms. Priestly. (Already we are suspending disbelief. How many of you have never heard of Anna Wintour? Pity upon your souls!) After endless demeaning remarks about her lack of fashion sense, the lovely Hathaway learns to dress in dazzling, costly outfits (a lot of Chanel, and far beyond her pitiful salary). The wardrobe staff and consulting designers must have had fun creating these.<br/><br/>The ""devil"" moniker seems overdone. Priestly may be demanding, arbitrary, and cruel -- a true boss from hell -- but she is in no sense evil or unethical. She's a real person who does what she believes is right, her corporate maneuvering is relatively genteel, and her closet is bigger than many stores! This film gets 5 out of 5 on acting, directing, production, and editing. Where it's weak is that the plot is too milquetoast, really just a ""slice of life"" of Andrea's most interesting year, as seen through 23-year old eyes. And felt the ending was a cop-out, wherein she throws it all away after showing herself to be a great master, on the verge of rapid promotion. Her social network should have supported her.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13, sexual situations, language, a few sexy outfits, a tad of kissing, and a non-fatal car accident.<br/><br/>2 days later. The LA Times notes that the film's world of fashion is somewhat unrealistic, since what is really ""in"" now are pieces by more unknown designers.<br/><br/>The NY Times notes that the book is uniformly venomous towards Priestly (Wintour), while the film softens this by deleting/adding material and portraying her more sympathetically. Viewed in this light the it seems almost Machiavellian to give the haughty Priestly to one of our greatest living actresses, Meryl Streep, and Andrea to the ingénue Hathaway, who has heretofore lived mainly on her looks. In an interview Hathaway said she felt upstaged, but learned much. A fiendishly clever casting decision, and one that must have the real Anna Wintour laughing with appreciation at this sincere flattery by the producers! <br/><br/>My next question is whether Hathaway will develop more depth and maturity behind her bland persona. I hope so, as her career has many years yet to run."

But Amanda decides to bite back by becoming one vogue looking woman and Miranda's best assistant ever, but things are not looking up when she begins to loose everything she truly loves.<br/><br/>I would recommend The Devil Wears Prada for an afternoon with the girls, honestly, please don't think this is sexist, I'm not sure if this movie is for the guys, but who knows?

","A sweet, clever but fashion challenged girl Andy (Anne Hathaway) who dreams of becoming a writer suddenly finds a job, ""million girls would kill for"", as a second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the draconian demanding editor of the most prestigious fashion Runway magazine in New York City. The job description - to be available for her boss 365/24/7 and to be ready for the labors that even the legendary Hercules would not be able to accomplish.<br/><br/>The movie about fashion industry is always fun to watch and ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is not an exception. I loved the look, the clothes, the shoes (OMG!!), the bags, the clips from the fashion shows. Stanley Tucchi is memorable in the supporting role - this guy is seriously underrated. Anne Hathaway is very likable and she's got beautiful eyes and lips. But THE main reason to see the movie is Meryl Streep who reigns and over-towers everything in it as the Uber-bitch Miranda Priestly. She should play the roles like that more often. Big thumbs up! She looked very sexy too. What I did not like - in the film her Miranda comes up somehow sympathetic. In the book she was totally heartless, self-obsessed and manipulating. There are some changes in the script comparing to the book that make Andy's final decision rather unconvincing. What happened in the book made it much more believable. When it comes to the story and the reasons for Andy's feeling guilt, the movie gets weak. I did not see any betrayal or losing the integrity or selling the soul there. Quoting a friend, ""She did NOT manipulate or back stab or undermine her co-worker. She did a better job. And was rewarded. That is NOT betrayal."" And one more thing - why did her friend make such a big deal out of Andy's rather innocent conversation with Christian Thompson at the Art show? With all these ""serious"" conflicts, the movie should be called ""Much Ado About Nothing"". Once again, bravo to Meryl Streep for her fantastic performance.<br/><br/>6/10"

It's fun to watch her go through the transformation from sloppy to chic. It's when she realizes her personality is transforming in a not-so-good way that she must decide what she wants.

"JackCerf","7","3","6","5 July 2006"," Chanel Boot Camp
","This is a boot camp movie, like An Officer and A Gentleman, with Meryl Streep in the Lou Gosset, Jr. role. Trainee Anne Hathaway is given seemingly impossible assignments by this heartless, demanding mentor who is curious to see if the kid is smart enough and tough enough to learn the job and do it. Hathaway succeeds because she is smarter, tougher and more competitive than she likes to think she is. (After all, the kid didn't get to be editor in chief of her undergraduate paper simply on girlish charm and good looks). What pulls her in to Streep's world isn't really the clothes and the glamour. It's the pride in meeting impossible standards and showing the old bitch that she can take it all, get it done, and come back for more. Her reward is to know that she really is as good as the demands of the job require -- and those demands include believing in the job, not just doing it. In other words, Streep runs the same con on Hathaway that drill sergeants and law professors have been running for years, and she almost pulls it off.<br/><br/>The movie breaks down at the end because drill sergeant Streep doesn't pull it off, and her failure doesn't ring true. Hathaway's character couldn't be both as competitive as she is and as girly-naive as she is about the consequences of competition at the highest level, where there are a lot more butts than there are chairs to sit them in. It's as if Richard Gere, after winning Gosset's approval, had said, ""Wait a minute. You mean I'll have to drop bombs on people when I'm a Navy pilot? I quit."" Until then, though, DWP provides the pleasure of watching the old story of a rookie mastering a difficult, challenging craft and learning along the way that she has a lot more resources than she thought she had."

","I went to see this movie because of the cast. My thinking was, with the likes of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci, something good would have to surface. My thinking was correct. This is simply a good story. Meryl Streep plays her ""evil"" role to the hilt but still manages to make you like some little part of her. Stanley Tucci always amazes me as he turns up when I least expect him and nails his roles. This one is no exception. Ann Hathaway does a good job going from college prep to hat couture. She is a very lovely actor and one that should continue to grow. The rest of the cast was equally entertaining. <br/><br/>Do not go expecting some great life lesson but, if you want to see an interesting look into the fashion world, watch a few people question their choices and some others who just do not care who they step on, this is a good choice as an alternative to the action and animation movies out there.

","I've posted dozens of comments here on IMDb. Most have been fairly favorable. I've found something positive about even the worst movies over the years. But this one? I cannot find one thing good to write about it. My gal and I eagerly waited for its arrival through the mail. Our family and friends recommended the movie highly. So even though we are not into high fashion and are in our 50's, we were expecting to be entertained. What we got instead was a quick trip into dreamland. It is perhaps the most boring movie we ever watched. No redeeming value. No laughs. No suspense. No eroticism. No reason to fight off the temptation to shut it off and go to sleep. I don't care if Meryl Streep has won 50 Oscars. Even she couldn't save this snoozer. She's not funny, not sexy, and probably as obnoxious in real life as she portrayed on the screen. The rest of the cast, except for Ann Hathaway, went through the motions and collected their checks. Ann was at least cute and looked like she was having a good time. But it was not enough to keep anybody who's not in the fashion scene and over 25 years old awake and enjoying The Devil Wears Us Out."

You have it: mumble-mumble she lifts her finger, mumble-mumble, she gives that look, mumble-mumble time for some fast edits and cute faces because diva Streep just hasn't got what it takes in the voice department. And this is a film that swims or sinks on its vocal merits. <br/><br/>Mumbling has sunk many a film, just look (before you lurch screaming for the exit) at Al Pacino in Revolution. Clint Eastwood did it because he could pull it off, cool, it was his persona - and you cannot pull that out of your handbag. Why do actors keep thinking they can pull it off? As for the English girl (why mention her name?), she is so out of her element; you just want to tell her to go back to chewing horse grass in daddy's paddock darling.<br/><br/>VERDIT: The film is now in the UK.

","I'm a guy and I really liked The Devil Wears Prada. I don't typically like ""chick flicks"" but this is a smart movie...the kind of movie that Hollywood made in the 1930's with three dimensional characters played by Kathryn Hepburn or Rosiland Russell. It's such a shame that there aren't more roles like Amanda Priestly (Meryl Streep) and Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) for women in movies today. Streep and Emily Blunt (as Emily) are fabulous in this film about a tyrannical editor of a fashion magazine.<br/><br/>I'll admit I was expecting a lot of obligatory teaser shots of models from this movie, but only because that is what I expect out of Hollywood at this point... garbage that panders to a shallow, dumbed-down America. The Devil Wears Prada does not take this easy route and this is why it's so refreshing. Andy is a young journalist wanting to work her way up and applies as an assistant to Miranda, who sees right through her in the opening interview scene. This is such a wonderful scene and I was impressed with Hathaway's ability to not get blown right off the screen by the incredible, understated performance of Ms. Streep. Streep has definitely earned her place as one of the greatest actresses in film history and her performance here is just more evidence of this, and it is a pleasure to watch her work.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci is also perfectly cast as Nigel, Mirandas unappreciated right hand man. Nigel, we presume is gay, but we don't know for sure because it isn't the typical Hollywood ""lets-throw-in-a-gay-guy-for-the-obvious-jokes"" (or because its fashionable and/or politically correct). Nigel is another three dimensional character who later becomes part of a sub-plot...and his sexual orientation is never even taken into consideration. Again, this movie is too smart to take the obvious or easy way to entertain us.<br/><br/>We need more movies like The Devil Wears Prada...a well acted, well directed, and entertaining story that doesn't go for the cheap thrills.<br/><br/>And Kate, Roz, Bette...you'd be proud of Meryl, Emily and Anne."

"Karl Self","7","2","4","6 April 2009"," Two movies for the price of one
","There are two movies here: one is a terribly vapid, insipid, shallow, hokey, schlocky (you get the impression) small-town-girl-in-the-big-city flick that will appeal mostly to small-town girls and their sympathizers. I couldn't make up my mind which was the schlockiest bit, when Anne Hathaway, the girl who holds the Guiness world record for biggest lips and eyes and who makes anorexic nymphs look ungainly, has to play the fat, unstylish, ugly duckling, or when she has fake moral qualms about telling her colleague that she will supplant her on a dream trip to Paris. I was writhing on the floor in agony and shaking my fist towards the sky at so much cinematic glucose. And, of course, in the end our ingénue gains everyone's respect including that of her demon boss, and does the right thing by writing stirring stuff about servants on strike for a newspaper where everything and everybody has a greyish hue of brown (viz, the real world). And her boyfriend's a cook (Jamie Oliver's influence becomes palpable here) who makes her grilled cheese sandwiches with ""five dollars' worth of Jarlsberg"" in them. Retch!<br/><br/>Luckily there is also the other movie, one that features The Streepster as the fashion editor which makes the devil on his throne with his troop of succubi and incubi dancing around him look meek; Stanley Tucci as the extravagant fashion expert; and most of all Emily Blunt as our lead's super-sarcastic colleague (the one who doesn't get to go to Paris). Emily Blunt is a real discovery and pretty much makes this movie. I'm surprised that she hasn't been in every movie that was ever made since then. On that level the movie is really well-made and fun. All you have to do is to tune out of the scenes that don't feature the aforementioned three actors, and you'll be sound as a pound."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","2","4","22 February 2009"," Appealing to women, but not a chick flick
","Although any film with the word ""Prada"" in the title might seem like a chick flick red flag for men and people that don't enjoy romantic comedies, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a surprisingly un-cliché film that is really quite far from a romantic comedy--it's simply a fashion-focused spin on the classic ""what happens when you sacrifice your personal life for your career"" theme. <br/><br/>The film, based on the popular novel, stars Anne Hathaway as Andy, an aspiring journalist who looking for a foot in the door in the Big Apple takes a job as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep, who really steals the film), editor-in-chief of Runway magazine and queen of the fashion industry. Andy, however, doesn't care much for fashion, and Miranda is notorious for being unreasonably demanding, cold and cynical. Regardless, Andy sticks with the job and begins to stray from her goals, affecting her career and personal life with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier of ""Entourage"").<br/><br/>Streep is simply the highlight of the film, something she's been known to do. She's so convincingly detestable that the script needs no mention of ""the devil""--the book/film title makes sense just watching and listening to her. At the same time, Streep also portrays the person inside the stone-cold machine, complicating her character and making the viewer truly think about his or her opinion.<br/><br/>At the same time, Hathaway is deserving of recognition that she can be a bankable marquee star. She's way beyond ""Princess Diaries"" now. Her struggle to fit in, try her hardest, make things with her boyfriend work and decide on her future is so easy to identify with every step of the way. We're never left unsure of what her character is thinking or feeling and that's a tremendous accomplishment. Other noteworthy performances include Stanley Tucci, who also works for Miranda, as the effeminate mentor Andy turns to when she needs help fitting in with the fashion scene, and Emily Blunt as Miranda's other assistant who is a nervous wreck.<br/><br/>Directing the film is David Frankel, whose experience directing a handful of ""Sex and the City"" episodes certainly comes in handy. He makes sure all the critical fashion elements of the film are shown off, including some effective montages that show a variety of outfits to appeal to the female audience. Although I haven't read the book, Aline Brosh McKenna delivers a very witty script that steers clear from all things cheesy. Some of the lines that Streep and Tucci have will make you think about fashion in a totally new way.<br/><br/>So what makes the film male-friendly? It has to do with the fact that Andy's struggle is incredibly universal. The struggle between trying to advance your career and holding on to what you care about most is something that anyone can understand. Also, everyone in working world knows that feeling of complete powerlessness that Miranda forces upon Andy. Streep is so easy to hate because she has some oppressive qualities that we all relate to in our lives. Lastly, guys don't have to fear their being too much romantic drama between Andy and Nate. Their relationship exists for the sake of affecting Andy and contributing to the film's themes. They barely feel like a couple on the screen. The other romantic relationship between Andy and a major journalist figure played by Simon Baker doesn't get too sappy either."

It just seems that the film missed no opportunities to hit every single possible cliché, and there wasn't a single moment you didn't see coming a mile away: <br/><br/>* You know that Andrea is going to turn into a fashionista (it isn't as if Hathaway hasn't done the Ugly Duckling routine before) suddenly become Ms. Competent Workaholic with no time for her Ordinary Friends and Boyfriend, but nonetheless go back to being Sweatshirt Girl with the Serious Meaningful Job before the end.<br/><br/>* You know that Miranda's going to be a complete, unreasonable bitch.<br/><br/>* You know that there's going to be the heartwarming moment where Miranda has her own personal crisis, and you know the period of sympathy the audience momentarily has for her will be limited to the seven minutes it takes for her to pull her next screwjob.<br/><br/>* You know that Nate will be ordinary, down to earth and soulful (hey, he's wearing black eyeliner all around his eyes, of course he's soulful and deep) and rebel against his lady's work hours.<br/><br/>* You know the affable wannabe boyfriend will prove to be a user before the final reel ...<br/><br/>And so on, and so forth. Just about the only part I genuinely appreciated was Andrea's calm speech about how no one would bat an eye at these behaviors were they done by men, but that isn't enough to sustain a movie.<br/><br/>5/10, and only because the acting performances were solid."

","Perhaps this is one of those things where translation was lost between book and film, i certainly wont know as i don't normally read fiction, and if i did read fiction (that's what movies are for, but that is just me), i would not read this book.<br/><br/>I suppose that what made me and my wife miss the mark on this film was the fact that the interpretation of ""devil"" was not a malevolent devil, but merely a crafty individual who was pulling the strings of just about everyone and every thing.<br/><br/>For the most part i could describe this film as watching the heart monitor of a dead person, who periodically spasms due to fluctuations in the body...<br/><br/>I am not a doctor by any stretch, and i know the analogy is poor so let me draw it out for you...<br/><br/>the movie kind of felt like this --------------------------^----------------------------^-------- It really didn't do much except have a blip of something sporadically placed here and there.<br/><br/>I suppose you could argue that it was the overall message that was important, however by the time you get to that message your so bored out of your mind cause nothing really happened.<br/><br/>And i am not talking about action, or bang em up shoot em up, but at least some type of dynamics would have been nice.<br/><br/>Even something like ""great expectations"" with ethan hawke and gweneth paltrow that could very easily be comparable to this, had a certain amount of dynamics to it, and i really enjoyed that film.<br/><br/>The acting was okay i suppose, and streeps character was stereotypical to that type of lifestyle that was being portrayed. but considering that i don't know anyone near that income level i can't really say for certain. half the time she acted as if she had swallowed vallium or prozac before each take.<br/><br/>Now perhaps that was the point, and if it was then she played the part well. however the overall boredom and lack of any type of fluctuation in her character simply put me to sleep.<br/><br/>I get the idea that the moral of the story is to make one think how far would they go to further their career. what type of sacrifice would have to be made and all, but there are certainly better movies that portray this message, again with the aforementioned ""great expectations"".<br/><br/>Thankfully my wife and i did not have to pay to see this, and decided to watch it due to a brief fit of 1am insomnia. however after viewing it, the insomnia was cured and our pillows awaited our drowsy bodies."

","did anybody else get the notion that Meryl Streep somewhat resembles Glenn Close as Cruella Devil in this movie? I loved it! I expected just another good for a rainy day and TV dinner sort of romcom or girly flick. Well, it is, more of the latter than the former. But it's also a story of exploration and search. Anne Hathaway, besides being an attractive heroine for the role executes her hapless, impulsive, ""people-pleaser, 24-7"" personality convincingly. I don't even need to mention that I forgot I was watching Meryl Streep in the supposed title role or as the film's 'villainess'.<br/><br/>With some quite moments here and there, and 'aha!' moments experienced by Andrea (Hathaway), and gladly - since this is a movie about exploration and searching for what you really want it is virtually devoid of voice overs that have to bombard you. The scenes just move the story forward, and that's all that counts. Of course the outcome is predictable if you follow stories with this formula, nonetheless I give it a 4/5.<br/><br/>Which reminds me, now I better get a rip off manuscript of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Can you get that for me??"

","No prizes for guessing this was a wifey pick. Not much about it appealed to me at all, but I gave it a go. <br/><br/>""The Devil Wears Prada"" tells the story of Andy Sachs (Hathaway), a young aspiring journalist who gets a big break by landing a PA role for the queen of the fashion world, Miranda Prisetly (Streep). Andy isn't a fashion follower at all and only sees the job as a stepping stone into big time journalism. She soon learns though that if she wants to get anywhere, she better get into the fashion thing. Before she knows it her personal life is getting infringed by the demanding hours and chores that come along with the job.<br/><br/>Will she stick it out? Will she sell out? <br/><br/>OK, but a totally confusing message which seemed to change several times through the movie. Some good performances, but certainly way too over rated."

","Recap: Andy, an aspiring writer and journalist is applying for the job of being Miranda Priestly's, Runways chief editor, assistant, a job million of girls would kill for. But not Andy. Andy is not in to fashion, not at all. She only sees this job as a stepping-stone to later ""real"" jobs. But it is not as easy at it seems. Miranda is extremely demanding and never gives any compliments. Andy's life soon revolves only around keeping Miranda content and Andy slowly gradually turns into a Runway-girl.<br/><br/>Comments: A really nice comedy about Andy and her suddenly chaotic life. Funny situations, good line deliveries and a little absurdity make this comedy really nice. And in addition to that there are two things to augment the movie. First of is Andy's relationship with Nate. It's sweet, warm and loving, and it's impossible not to care. Finally there are the small comments, both by characters and the filmmakers, about the fashion-industry and the world at large that also gives the move an interesting (and unexpected) depth. Some issues is actually worth thinking about, and the points made valid.<br/><br/>Also I would like to commend the use of music in this movie. It has a nice way of slowly fading in and lending weight to the scene, always augmenting the pictures and never stealing focus. Also a lot of scenes are done with great skill and creativity. Especially the one when Andy changes clothes walking to work (you know the one if you've seen the movie) - and I liked it very much.<br/><br/>Good performances all around, when the cast is considered. It couldn't been easy for Streep to be Priestly, but she pulled that off without any glitches. Also really good performances, and nice characters, from supporting cast like Tucci and Blunt. And finally there is Hathaway. First off, allow me to be a little superficial. Those eyes... d*mn. She got an easier role - considering her character are much more likable but she does really well too.<br/><br/>All in all, a good movie that lacks that little special thing that make it outstanding, but I don't regret spending time seeing it either...<br/><br/>7/10"
"RisingStar12","7","2","4","22 December 2006"," A very interesting film and one that defines fashion
","This movie, the devil wears Prada, is an interesting film. The plot seems to be predictable for the first hour of the film and you feel as if you know the exact ending. However, the film then twists and bends into something you didn't predict, something you never would have imagined, but nevertheless something that is genius; sub plots. The devil wears Prada is a great film with very different moments. Comicial moments, happy moments, sad moments, even surprisingly touching moments that grab your heart. The acting is fantastic. Meryl Streep is, of course, fantastic. You can't even tell she is acting she plays her part so well. You feel as if you are REALLY looking at a mean and cruel boss instead of a person simply stating lines. Anne Hathaway is also wonderful, and she brings us moments of comedy, joy, satisfaction; tons of different feelings inside of you. Emily Blunt plays her character very professionally and with elegance and, of course, somewhat fear of her boss. She plays her part perfectly. Everyone plays their part perfectly. From the main character do a guy who walks into a party. As you watch the film, you realize that this film does define fashion and the fashion world. The mandatory requirements are being skinny and being beautiful. This film I would have to say meets those requirements. It is somewhat short and doesn't waste time on scenes that are pointless, so one could say it is skinny. And more importantly, it is beautiful."

","The plot: okay so the plot is a little bit predictable but I think that it is still very fun to watch it unfold in front of you. I mean it's a little Ugly Betty and Princess Diaries but it's fun.<br/><br/>The performances: First of all, Meryl Streep's performance is superb. She was literally perfect as Miranda Preistly (and the hair is rockin') Anne Hathaway as Andy Sacs is pretty good. I mean it's as good as usual. Emily (Miranda's assistant) delivers a solid performance. She's sarcastic so it's pretty funny.<br/><br/>Anything Else: This movie has a lot to do with style so you basically feel cool just watching it. And how bad could that be. Meryl Streep is so mean it's funny. The costumes are great. The New York scene is awesome and they make plenty of Starbucks references (which is awesome lol.) The dialogue is very funny. Everything about ""Prada"" is very funny."

","I thought ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was an excellent film. It contained the perfect mix of comedy first, drama second. Meryl Streep shows again why she is the best actress since Lauren Bacall. Anne Hathaway is always enjoyable as the protagonist who usually gets the ""necessary"" makeover. I always wonder if the makeover scenes are actually shot at the end of the movies, making her under for the before shot. Her outfits and style throughout, maybe minus the blue sweater, are amazing and make Emily look like a London dock walker. Emily's character is fantastic as well and adds such immediate high strung humour, keeping the pace moving. It makes me wonder how she managed to not have a complete meltdown as her character, and on set as an actor. I enjoy how Meryl told Anne Hathaway prior to filming that she thought she was a good actress and then told her that would be the last nice thing she said to her during filming. Meryl wanted to stay in character, making Anne's reactions indeed real. Whether it is Runway or actually Vogue, the idea is great, the filming and dialogue are immaculate. It is a feel good movie, even though it may not have the typical beginning, middle or End that we have come to expect from most Hollywood films. After you watch Prada, you will want to wear it, as well as Gucci and Dolce for that matter."

","I went to go see this movie, because I though the way they marketed this with the theatrical trailer was genius. If any of you have been to the movie theatres in the past two months you have seen the trailer for this movie and thought you walked in on the wrong movie, because the trailer is the opening sequence of the movie, which I thought was such genius marketing strategy! So here's my review, if that trailer peaked your curiosity then you should see the movie. The movie is slick, fast paced, view of the deep dark side of the fashion industry.<br/><br/>Ms. Streep gives a performance which was incredible. She WILL BE nominated for supporting actress nomination, or the academy is a joke.<br/><br/>Anne Hatheway with her big eyes did a great job of playing the budding new assistant who has to fit into a dark world of fashion. Her transformation in this movie is really good. This is much better than her princess diaries role, although similar.<br/><br/>My girlfriend enjoyed all of the brand names of clothes featuring in the movie, which I'm don't have that big of an eye for. But every scene she was like ""I want that"". So I think the costume people did a great job in that respect to make a movie two years ago that is still fashionably hip today.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie. It's not one of those movies that will go down in history, but Ms. Streep's performance will!"
"triple8","8","2","4","9 July 2006"," a lot of fun, well acted and surprisingly poignant as well
","SPOILERS: <br/><br/>I have not read the book but enjoyed the movie a lot. Although this may not be for everybody I thought it was wonderful and Seeing the movie actually made me want to read the book. The Devil Wears Prada is an enjoyable movie with great performances particularly from Streep who steals the movie.<br/><br/>There have been other movies made that attempt to showcase the fashion industry but I think this one does it the best. What I liked about this movie was the following: it was witty. It was fun, sassy and satirical. And I'm always up for movies that showcase superficiality and then rip that same superficiality to shreds! It's refreshing to see a movie like this and oodles of fun. It seems almost everything was done well. The pacing was snappy and quick and very good. The music selections were perfect(""Crazy' is one of my favorite songs.) The glamor aspect was captured well-really well-and the characters were all believable.<br/><br/>And then there's Streep. She was EXCELLENT and I am sure she will receive an Oscar or Golden Globe Nomination. I will admit this movie would not have been what it was without her and having her in it just made the movie.<br/><br/>Hathaway was also the perfect choice to Play Andrea. Anne Hathaway is a lovely actress and it was nice seeing her in the lead role. I was quite surprised to see Gisele Bundchen had a small part. I thought the casting of all was perfect.<br/><br/>And then there's the poignant aspect to the movie. This movie maybe fun and breezy but it is also painful in parts and thought provoking as well as being very true to life. I never worked in the fashion industry but did work in an industry where many of the people I worked with were almost replicas of some in the movie, only worse. For anyone who thinks the characters in this movie are not realistic, they definitely are. And in real life many are even more ruthless. The focus on looks, Money, and just image in general in our society is extremely sad, getting worse and a real issue and it's portrayed very well here. This is ""Working Girl"" for the Fashion industry. <br/><br/>The movie also shows power and glamor can get to even the unlikeliest of people by showing the change in Hathaway's character so well. My one complaint with the movie is that the movie's message could have been made a little clearer. It was a little muddled but the overall movie was still great.<br/><br/>I loved the end. I was afraid it would turn into a romantic comedy where Andrea is frantically trying to track her boyfriend down and he's boarding a plane about to leave town and she runs and runs....etc etc. man I'm glad that didn't happen. I LOVED the end and really liked that Miranda was humanized. Actually I really liked the movie as a whole. It was exactly what I hoped it would be and how often does that happen? My vote is 10 of 10 for enjoyment and 8.5 for the movie as a whole."

"JanVermeulen311","9","2","4","3 July 2006"," More than I thought it would be!
","I was looking for an entertaining afternoon. But it makes anyone who puts too much into work stop and think. A good viewing for anyone too wrapped up in work! There is also an excellent message regarding staying true to your values. Anne Hathaway loses her way in the excitement and status of her position. Her friends bring her back to what is really important to her. Meryl Streep, as always, gave a defining portrayal of a driven woman in her 50s. She did not overplay the role, which could be tempting. She really wasn't ""the devil""; she was just a misguided, over-achieving woman. From my point of view, there were two extremely poignant moments. The first occurs when Miranda is speaking with Andy regarding her (yet another!) divorce. We see Miranda stripped of the accouterments of her power, and she is just another lonely, driven woman. The second occurs when we see Miranda observing Andy after Andy has quit and sought another position with a real newspaper. There is a sterling moment in which we see Miranda smile, acknowledging the journalist she might have become if she had chosen a different path. I was underwhelmed by the gentleman who portrayed Nate. He was unconvincing as Andy's voice of reason. I was overwhelmed by the portrayal of the ""first assistant"" Emily, portrayed by Emily Blunt. She captured the striving, strident young professional, but with just enough humanness for us to love her! I would recommend this movie to anyone. It contains significant messages for both young and old - or not so old. It also contains a ""just right"" performance by Ms. Streep, capturing Miranda's coldness without beating the daylights out of her. Stanley Tucci as Nigel was over the top!! His grace under fire was incredible and he graciously conveyed the kind of wisdom we all look for in our coworkers. He was truly amazing! Tracie Thomas as Lilly also gave a wonderful performance. All women need a conscience like Lilly to keep them from taking the wrong path. She was professional, empathetic but as stern as we sometimes need our friends to be with us!!"
"RandomTask-AP","8","2","4","3 July 2006"," A Crackling ""Inferno""
","It's the publishing world, not the world of fashion, that Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is pursuing when she enters the offices of ""Runway"" magazine. It's a detour that she thinks will lead her to a better job down the road, but it becomes the hellpit that will consume her life thanks to the endlessly demanding editor-in-chief of the magazine, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). The only guides through the rapidly moving echelons of the business are her co-assistant, Emily (Emily Blunt) and higher-up, Nigel (Stanley Tucci). Her friends and loyal boyfriend, Nate (Adrien Grenier) struggle to keep Andy grounded as she gets pulled further into Miranda's world. The result may most easily fall into the category of ""chick flick"", but what emerges is a sharp character-driven Hollywood comedy with some of the best performances to be seen so far this year.<br/><br/>As is often the case, it's the villain rather than the hero who resonates with the audience, and even with a smaller share of the screen time, this is certainly Meryl Streep's movie. Miranda is not one for tirades. She's simply threatening by being there. Any unwanted question or interruption is met with a searing look and a calm dismissal that sends the receiver crushed and scurrying for cover. Never have the words, ""That's all,"" been uttered with so many variations of menace and meaning. This is used even when referring to the task of finding a plane and pilot to fly her out of Florida in the middle of a hurricane so she can make her daughters' recital. Eventually, we do get to see another side of this ""devil"", and although the veneer of ferocity is broken, Streep briefly illustrates a woman of great dignity and pride. It brings to mind the Twain remark about how every story has two sides, and as weak a case as it might be, how many of us have ever heard the devil's version? (We'll all be hearing about this one again at Oscar time.) <br/><br/>However, make no mistake that Streep's Miranda is the Mephistopheles to those who are under her watch, and the rest of the cast is constantly scrambling to avoid her wrath. Anne Hathaway stands apart from most of her co-tweenie entertainers with consistently solid performances in varying projects, and here, she fills Andy with believably alternating doubt and hope as she struggles to reach her conflicted goals of pleasing Miranda and just surviving her. Emily is a shallow sycophant who takes pleasure in lording her experience over Andy while clinging to her dream of making contacts at the Paris Fashion Week. However, when disaster strikes, Emily the actress shows that pain runs deep no matter who you are. The only voice resembling friendship from inside of the Runway offices is Stanly Tucci's Nigel, whom Emily reaches out to in frustration when effort after effort seems to fail to get Miranda's approval. Nigel gives her a helping hand, but what he really succeeds in doing is leading her further down the rabbit hole. He's been a part of Miranda's world so long that he cannot see a way out even for himself.<br/><br/>Director David Frankel has made a world that is both beautiful and horrifying. As reviewer David Edelstein stated, this is a story that plays to the teen girl fantasy of being both beautifully fashionable and proving that you have depth of character, but the script is above the typical tweenie entry. The drama is not overstated with shouting matches. It keeps everyone else the same respect of character that it affords Miranda. A fight between Andy and her boyfriend is simply her coming in late and apologizing to him as he skulks off to bed. It's often pointed in moments where you feel trouble has started, but it just hasn't come to bear yet.<br/><br/>This isn't a story about the real fashion world. As interviews with former Vogue employees reiterate. Miranda is an amalgam of several real-life characters, and publishers don't go to their offices in green eye shadow and in head-to-toe Gucci or Prada. This is a hyper-realized New York, much like the NYC from Frankel's experience on ""Sex in the City"". In the brilliant sequence where we follow Andy's walk to work and her outfits change as people and cabs pass between her and the camera, it would not be a surprise to see Carrie Bradshaw breaking up with someone after a luckless one-night-stand. This just makes it a Hollywood experience and puts everything into high relief to emphasize the bad boss experience we've all had. <br/><br/>Ultimately, this is about careers and how far people are willing to go in order to make them work. Try not to get caught up in what it might imply about women's fashion; this could easily be on a double bill with ""Wall Street"". (Although, ""Prada"" doesn't have the same weight as Stone's film. This is a comedy, after all.) Not since Dante Hicks's long day at The Quick Stop has anyone had such an entertainingly torturous work experience. I'm just relieved I wasn't the one tripping over myself to find the unpublished manuscript for ""Harry Potter 7"".<br/><br/>8 out of 10"
"LadyLiberty","6","2","4","2 July 2006"," The Devil Wears Prada a Pleasant Surprise
","The Devil Wears Prada I'm not a fashion geek nor am I especially into so-called ""chick flicks,"" but I had a little extra time to kill before meeting a friend this weekend. Since I think that Meryl Streep is arguably the best actress alive today, I decided to occupy an hour and a half by buying a ticket for The Devil Wears Prada. Yes, it's a film focused on fashion. Yes, you'd probably call it a ""chick flick."" But you know what? I was entertained.<br/><br/>The titular devil is Runway Magazine editor, Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). She goes through assistants like some people go through chewing gum  and she treats the girls with just about as much thought as she'd offer to a used up wad of Juicy Fruit Enter Andrea Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who is applying to take the place of the most recently fired Second Assistant. Andrea (or Andy, as she says most people call her) isn't into fashion, but she needs the job and she knows it will be good experience for her. But Miranda's First Assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) isn't so sure that Andy's right for the position.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, just as Emily is ready to send Andy on her way, Miranda herself arrives and decides that only she can hire a suitable replacement. While she also doesn't consider Andy a good fit, a brief burst of assertiveness on Andy's part wins her the chance at the job. As she jumps in to the deep end and flails around accordingly, she's repeatedly told that ""millions of girls would die for"" her new job. In fact, it's not long before Andy wishes she was dead.<br/><br/>Miranda is hopelessly demanding and impossible to please. Emily resents Andy and offers the barest possible amount of help. And Andy herself would frankly much rather be writing than hanging up Miranda's coat, buying her coffee, or delivering her dry cleaning. But she doggedly keeps trying because she's hoping her position will at least open a few editorial doors down the road.<br/><br/>Andy's boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and her friends Lilly (Tracie Thoms) and Doug (Rich Sommer) sympathize even as they're taken a little aback by Andy's lack of interest in her job. Even Doug is excited about the designers she might get to meet, and the inside gossip she might get to hear; Lilly is impressed with the perks. But Nate and Andy's father only see that Andy is on call virtually 24 hours a day at the whim of her demanding boss, and that no matter what she does, it isn't good enough for Miranda.<br/><br/>In a fit of despair, Andy all but decides to give up. But when she complains to co-worker and Miranda's right hand man, Nigel (Stanley Tucci), he offers her at least the beginnings of a solution. Andy determines to give it a shot. Her attitude changes and she becomes more and more competent at her job. She also, however, becomes less and less of a friend  or a girlfriend. And when she meets the handsome writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), Andy realizes that her chance may finally be right here, and right now. But can she afford all it will cost her to take it? <br/><br/>Meryl Streep is, by virtually every account I've ever heard, a nice woman. Miranda Priestly, however, will convince you that she can't possibly be anything but cold, calculating, and downright cruel. All this, and Streep never once raises her voice! While this isn't the kind of role that wins anybody any awards, Streep apparently doesn't care. Her performance is stellar.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway, whose previous efforts have mostly been fluff roles (the lead in The Princess Diaries films, for example), made a point of showing her range by accepting a significant supporting role in Brokeback Mountain. With The Devil Wears Prada, she's gone back to fluff, but it's considerable fluff given her many scenes with Streep, and she does a surprisingly good job at holding up her end of the bargain. While she's not there yet, I suspect that Hathaway is capable of being formidable herself.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is all quite good, but special mention must be made of Stanley Tucci. His character is fussy and egotistical, yet vulnerable; he seems flighty at best, yet exemplifies stolid loyalty. Meanwhile, Simon Baker is relegated largely to the role of eye candy. That being said, he's very nice eye candy which, in a movie like this one, does count.<br/><br/>The Devil Wears Prada isn't anything other than what it's supposed to be, and that's a diverting hour and a half. It does offer up some life lessons for young girls (at the same time taking away from them somewhat by glorifying the very thin models and holding up starvation as a diet technique), but the one thing the movie really has going for it is the simple fact that most women of most ages, whether they'll admit it publicly or not, will probably be entertained.<br/><br/>FAMILY SUITABILITY: The Devil Wears Prada is rated PG-13 for ""some sensuality."" Everything is ambiguous enough, though, that I don't see a real problem with kids of age 11 or so and up. The Devil Wears Prada would be a pretty good date movie for the younger set, and a great flick for mothers and daughters. Drop your sons off at a Superman Returns screening though; as much as girls are going to enjoy The Devil Wears Prada, boys are going to hate it."

","The only reason I gave it an 8 instead of a 10, is because the plot is no stunner. but Meryl Streep is the 'it girl' of this movie. the character she portrays does not become a caricature even when she allows herself brief moments of human frailty. She is delightfully 'New York' in the way that most of us dread running afoul of, but secretly delight in watching. As long as it is someone else who is being taken down a peg or two.<br/><br/>The Anne Hathaway character is more of a caricature, but since the only other movie I can recall seeing her in was Brokeback Mountain, I wasn't reminded of her roles in the Princess Diaries movies like some professional critics stated they were.<br/><br/>The fashions, attitudes, and world displayed, reminded me of why i am glad i no longer live there: addictive to acquire, beautiful to have, exhausting to maintain."

","Thinking this was going to be another frothy chick flick, I was pleasantly surprised not only with a brilliant cast, but an edgy and intelligent story. I was engaged from the get go and the suspense build up to Miranda's entrance was palpable. Stanley Tucci was the hero of the story as he played the understated male fashion guru. He played it light but not campy. Meryl never raised her voice once, but her genius was in the nuanced turns of her beautifully coiffed head and her favorite phrase, ""that's all!"" The plot turns and the conclusion were predictable. The director chose to leave some loose ends that either means he forgot to tie them up or left them for a sequel. Andrea was most believable as the not so naive aspiring writer who got more than she bargained for. A very enjoyable night's entertainment which was more than I was expecting from a fashion flick."

","Meryl Streep gives a masterly performance as the boss-from-hell, Miranda Priestly. Her cool and calm delivery is far more terrifying than taking the more obvious route of barking orders at her underlings. Meryl Streep injects a large does of humanity into a character that has the potential to be more of a cartoon.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt also do an excellent job with their supporting roles as put-upon minions. Their catty asides are delicious.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway, unfortunately, and the whole subplot about her losing her own identity, are just dull in comparison. The audience just doesn't really care about her.<br/><br/>The film could be used as a starting point for a feminist rant. However, it does at least acknowledge that a man acting the way Miranda does would be admired as an excellent leader - whereas a woman is just seen as a complete bitch.<br/><br/>The film is distinctly average, but worth watching for Streep alone. An Oscar nod wouldn't be a surprise."

","This movie was a real disappointment from the book. It didn't follow the original plot, nor was it half as interesting. Expecting a film that would at least hold my attention, I found myself praying for it to end. It lacked an interesting plot, and was a random mismatch of anecdotal scenes.<br/><br/>I was also relatively unimpressed with the acting of the main characters. Streep lacked the flair that was necessary for the role; sure, the lines were cold enough, but the biting cattiness that would've made for a truly memorable performance simply wasn't there. Additionally, there was almost no in-depth character development -- beyond witnessing the deterioration of Andrea's already lackluster relationship the characters were for the most part the same beginning to end. No character development, a nonexistent plot, and a poor job in the editing room made for a HUGE LETDOWN of a decent book."

","I disagree. So many crucial parts of the book were lazily omitted from the movie. Most important of these is Miranda's accent-- where did MS' come from? Also, the comic relief of Lily, who came off bitchy and inconsequential in the film. Personally, I miss the part with the private jet to chauffeur the HP books. Somehow I ended up sympathizing with Miranda because of all these missing pieces. Double agreement on Stanley Tucci and Simon Baker. We love us some Nigel, but Simon came off so plebeian as Christian. Whencely went the tall, dark, and handsome man of whom I fantasized while reading the book?

","The Devil Wears Prada is a 2006 comedy starring Anne Hathaway, Meryll Streep,Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt and tells the tale of a young inspiring journalist named Andy(Hathaway) who works at the fashion industry with a ruthless cold-hearted snob named Miranda(Meryll Streep). But how long will Andy stick at her job as Miranda's assistant?
The acting is good,the story is enjoyable and overall I enjoyed this movie. Meryll Streep was very good in this movie. Every movie that she stars in she's completely different in them all and she creates these personas.

","This is a Hollywoodised and dramatised version of the fashion industry to some extent for entertainment. Please do not take this film seriously. Meryl Streep does a marvelous job portraying Miranda Priestly, though. Anne Hathaway portrays Andy Sachs adequately very well. Because those 2 actresses know how to act successfully. However, this film is not my cup of tea because it is a bit dramatic for my liking. I, nonetheless, admire the hard work that the actors, actresses, writer, director, costume designers, and people who embarked on a journey to make The Devil Wears Prada did. When I became introduced to the Miranda Priestly character, I conclusively thought she would encompass the characteristics of Cruella de Vil throughout the film. Little did I know that I would witness Miranda crying because her ambitious enterprise in the fashion world would cause her personal life to be challenging. Empathically, I understand why she is a very competitive overachiever in a world that makes men's successes overshadow women's successes. Otherwise, Andy Sachs was a girl who had youthful energy and youthful uncertainty about who she wanted to be in her life because of her lack of experiences. Just watching Emily, who is portrayed by Emily Blunt, be emotionally and mentally invested in her job made me want to give her a hug because of how hard she worked. Nigel, the one Stanley Tucci portrays, made me feel like hugging him as well. Sometimes I wondered if I should give Nate Cooper a hug or not because I was not sure how supportive of a boyfriend he was to Andy's career because I never got to know Nate's personal life that much. So, I felt there was a part missing in this film. Describing Christian Thompson's character by Simon Baker is easy for me because Christian is an opportunistic man who knows what a beautiful and an intelligent woman is and who knows the competitive industry that he is in. Very much honesty from me would require me to admit that I find this movie very predictable and I have already watched other movies that resemble The Devil Wears Prada."

","This could've been a wonderful film, perhaps even it could have educated people on certain topics or challenged views-but the sensitive, one-dimentional, unrealistic characters and the countless montages with noisy, and sometimes unfitting, music-ruined it for me. And the end. Dreadful. And the opinion on fashion. I think this film had all the space to explore why fashion is judged, why it is superficial, why it is important, why it is harmful. And why Miranda Priestly is dubbed as ""The Devil"" and why others wouldn't. Instead we get;
Your desire to dress good means that you're superficial and ""One Of Them"", as a recurring topic."
"quiqueperezsoler","7","0","0","28 May 2020"," Aside from the underdeveloped main character and an inconsistent romantic subplot it was building up to something unique before it failed to deliver it.
","First I'll start praising what the movie does well: Meryl Streep's ruthless character is obviously the highlight of the movie, all the characters have great performances and their character motivations are consistent throughout the film except that of the main protagonist, which is exactly where the movie falls down to me.<br/><br/>What makes cakes great is the harmonic symbiosis between the different elements that conform it. If this movie was a cake, it delivers a great top and base layer that are the flashy, makeover, glamour-life aspects which are essential to a fashion movie; but misses the butter icing, the jam and the decorations in regards to comedy, romance, life lessons and realistic character arcs that similar ""rom-coms""-like movies like this normally also have. Movies from the same writer like ""Morning Glory"" or others like ""The Intern (2015)"" also starring Anne Hathaway which, while not having the same main plot or characters, the themes and spirit are similar featuring career-focused people ruining their personal life and interacting with experienced professionals played by famous celebrities.<br/><br/>To put it simpler, I get it. I get what the purpose of the whole backdrop of the fashion scene and how tough, superficial and demanding it is. But honestly, I wanted to watch this movie for the career angle because it was listed in many ""Top 10 movies about job seekers and uplifting movies"". And for the first half the movie had something different going on from the rest of the ""genre"" which was the angle of starting to work in a business as an intern/assistant of sorts while working your way up to your dream job and, in the process, finding an interest in the business you thought was only temporary.<br/><br/>However, the movie fails to deliver that feeling. And it is essentially due to our main vessel, Anne Hathaway's poorly written character. It baffles me how so many actors featured in this movie have great performances and character arcs and the main protagonist might have the worst one. Not in terms of progression but in terms of consistency. Let's be honest, these movies are predictable, there's so much you can do in a rom-com-esque genre like this and some try to do something different and that should be commended, but the choices she makes here make no sense. There is such a lack of consistency in her actions that her choices and reactions seem unnatural to that of a real person in romantic, career and friendship-related situations.<br/><br/>The change from a ""dorky"" selfless smart girl to a career-focused glossy self-centered one is too sudden to be believable. You mean to tell me the girl which didn't care about fashion at the beginning suddenly goes to a fashion show in Paris and has her jaw dropped emoting a found a passion for it? Perhaps, but we as the audience have not seen or felt it through her actions. She began as this strong opinionated person who knew what she wanted and didn't care about fashion to making every selfish fashion-oriented decision ever possible. You could attribute this to the theme of how the job and industry ""consumed"" her and how she was meant to realise all the wrong things she was doing, however it is so inconsistent to her character that it makes you wonder if you missed something. It's weird to say it but it almost seemed as there were some montage scenes missing for how underdeveloped it looked.<br/><br/>I don't want to get into spoilers, but the romantic subplot is so cliche and unrealistic that it is damaging to the protagonist integrity. If Anne Hathaway's character was supposed to be so smart and strong-willed, it doesn't really show. Her heart doesn't break when it is supposed to, she doesn't show that she cares about how she wronged her family and her friends after she realised the wrong things she did. And the reason is that it's just underdeveloped. There are so many scenes missing: apologizing, crying, frustration scenes. The runtime limits this movie so heavily, and I'm pretty sure all these underdeveloped themes are well fleshed out on the novel but here they are replaced by over the top scenes that may not even be that essential to the plot.<br/><br/>The comedy is not nearly as funny as it could have been in the frame given. So many other fashion movies have provided some of the best makeover scenes and flashy over the top but charming humorous scenes yet here there are no where to be found. As mentioned previously, even movies like Morning Glory and The Intern have better comedic timing and humorous scenarios that exploit the setting and situations the characters are put in, but it's unfortunate how this film doesn't exploit the fashion-scene (which by itself is already over the top) and still manages to be more praised than the other two. Perhaps this movie was the genre pioneer for the other two which came after this one, but that doesn't excuse it from its narrative mistakes.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, it should have been more self-aware and push the dramatic and comedic aspects a bit further. I was hoping to see a movie about the perils of a recently graduated girl getting an unsuiting temporary job (even though it is a highly-demanded job for a very important company in NYC, which is odd she would get hired) but finding herself learning the positive aspects of the competitive corporate world yet the themes taken from the fashion scene did not aid her development, the romantic subplot in ALL its parts was inconsistent and unrealistic not to mention unsatisfying to say the least; and the overall message and life lessons were either confusing due to their mutual exclusion or not fulfilling enough to fit the protagonist's personality. It's unfortunate because all the elements presented had a lot of potential and could have been very entertaining to watch."

A girl who's focused on her work and least bothered about the way she looks who in fact looks down upon the fashion industry, changes her approach to fit in for some time in order to get what she wants. And she does it so gracefully.<br/><br/>The part of the story concerning her friends and boyfriend was outrageous. When she undergoes transformation they blame her for it and expect her to stick to the old ways rather than encourage her to find herself in the way she prefers it. The bias is too strong! A person could look down upon certain things and later actually look up to it with respect after understanding it. That does not mean one doesn't have integrity. Here that happens with Hathway and her attitude towards the fashion industry. She recognises the efforts and dedication that goes into making the industry what it is. The fact that she and Nate (the boyfriend) even consider dating each other after the breakup is insane.

","2 July 2006. It's very difficult nowadays to produce a comedy without the usual stereotypes and The Devil Wears Prada must negotiate a very delicate balance between comedy and drama and popular audience attention and critical serious film-making. This movie does well in managing this dangerous terrain of high fashion and the usual cliques. The soundtrack was among the most amazing musical selectons and worked effectively with a highly powerful energizing musical score with the script and action. Meryl Streep as well as Ann Hathaway are great in their interplay while Director David Frankel manages to maintain the fine line of avoiding exaggerated melodrama while allowing the actors to carry the more subtle humorous undertone. Yet Meryl Streep and the script carries the movie with its biting, edgy character and the typical outcome is much more a question of tone and feeling than obvious, overt, and crassness (to which she was nominated for Oscar's Best Actress). Just as the world of high fashion, ironically, the hyper-energy, the highly powerful personalities, the rapid pace is brought successfully to the screen. Streep creates a richly, colorful character while Ann Hathaway manages to provide a more subdued but as strong and quiet a character in transformation but not overthetop. The only weakness of this movie is more one of having to address popular audiences and profits wherein the movie may have had to avoid a more hard-hitting even sharper dramatic edge. Even so, The Devil Wears Prada is a classic comedy drama that is compelling, entertaining, and rich in its characters. It is an almost perfect blend of music, set design, intelligent script, and acting that together combine to create a movie that worth seeing again and again for the sheer creative, fluid emotional outburst of comedy and drama.

","While I appreciate films that represent educated, career-driven women, this film might come off as a disappointment to many that hold prior expectations for what ""The Devil Wears Prada"" offers. Although it seems like a comedy, a 'woman's' movie, and/or a satire of the fashion industry, the film does not push any of these expectations hard enough, especially with its ending. However, if you are looking for a film about unapologetic women who will do whatever is necessary to achieve their goals, then ""The Devil Wears Prada"" dresses to impress. And in the same way, the film itself is unapologetic in presenting these women's realistic struggles within the workforce, not caring whether or not it entertains or bores you.

","The Devil Wears Prada is an interesting one. It's one part sincerity, two parts cynicism and possesses a certain love for each and every character within its narrative that it's reluctant to admit to at times, perhaps jut to keep a low profile with its realism. I've never read the book, but the film starts off going one way and seems like it will tidy itself up in a nice little resolution, and abandons it's comfort zone two thirds of the way through for something that cuts cuts a bit deeper. Anna Hathaway starts her arc in the adorable zone and progresses through confidence and finally arrives at in a jaded daze at a tough life lesson. She plays Andrea Sachs, a would be journalist who decides to take a detour and work as second personal assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) the editor and slave driver at Runway magazine, in hopes that doors will eventually open for her in her field. Not quite the breezy excursion she hoped for, as Priestly turns out to be a full on nightmare. Streep blusters into the film like an icy tornado, steady at the reigns of her character and completely owning every syllable of her delicious dialogue. Streep plays her as the ultimate boss from hell, and then cleverly shows us the woman beneath in one key scene that resonates nicely. Most of the time her personality resembles that of my fifth grade schoolteacher on a bad day, and it's utterly hilarious to see Streep, a god amongst progessionals, go for it like a praying mantis. Andrea also comes under the scrutiny of prim Emily (Emily Blunt, excellent), Miranda's first assistant who is aghast at her decision to hire this walking fashion disaster. Andrea quickly catches on though, holding her own with this difficult job at the expense of her relationship with her boyfriend (Adrian Grenier of Entourage). Stanley Tucci is equal parts snazzy and snooty as Nigel, Miranda's associate and eventual mentor figure for Andrea, superb as always. Simon Baker also shows up as a hotshot who tries just a little too hard to sweep Andi off her feet. Like I said before, the film tricks you with fluff and banter and eventually ends up somewhere more serious, with a painful look at what it takes to cut it in the business world, and the allegiences which sometimes get slashed and burned in favour of covering your own ass. Ugly stuff, for sure, but necessary and honest, a decision that helps the film greatly. Plus, it's pretty damn funny most of the time. Great stuff."

Magnify this with just a terrible boss. Now, if you work in anything entertainment base, you've heard the stories. And it extends even to the menial of heads of departments. Even a key grip can be a total jerk. And they play these mind games constantly. Most likely to conceal a deeper anger of being...not the top of the pile. Whilst everyone envies those who are in power, they are oftentimes faced with decisions that are just...morally bankrupt. Is it forgivable? Possibly. Is it understandable when you're in the midst of it? Nope. And Andy (Anne Hathaway) figures this out fast.<br/><br/>While not an amazing movie, it really hits on the fact that even the devil could have human qualities. Could it be a way to allure their victims, or be a learning experience. Testing you to see what type of person you are. Palming an bright shiny sweet apple to see how close you get. What I liked about this movie is that it rides that line. Never is Miranda (played wonderfully by Meryl Streep...duh) ever unjustified in her behavior. She is high-stressed and can't be bothered by details. As a new person, you see this as ridiculous pretentious garbage, but...the question is, why criticize something you desperately want? Andy is a Ivy League school go-getter. Probably would annoy you in school. But she is ambitious. And the reality is, girls like her, are seduced by a Miranda. They are jet setters and feared. The power is intoxicating. So in order for her to fully commit, she has to take the leap. With the guiding hand of Stanley Tucci's character. He is, I consider, the most tragic of Miranda's minions. He went through the ranks, in anticipation of the rewards. But the truth is, the world isn't fair. He doles out this advice to Andy in hopes she toughen up. Which eventually becomes putting it to practice.<br/><br/>There is a lot of truth in this movie that the novel may seem more one sided. The movie is far more even to how the world works. Had it been the straight novelization, we wouldn't get Miranda's motivation to her behavior. It's not terrible (as most would feel), it's how that world works. And if you don't like it, you don't have to belong."

","Yes, the principals are excellent doing their jobs. However - for me Emily Blunt stole the show followed very closely by Stanley Tucci, these two really took their roles, started in the basement with them, and proceeded to ascend to the Penthouse.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are, figuratively speaking, guardian angels to the newly hired young lady.<br/><br/>If I had invested in this production, I would be very pleased with the end result. There were some snafus to be sure, but I didn't feel that they took away from the interesting story, or the sometimes frenetic pace.<br/><br/>Well worth seeing at least one time, worth the price of a ticket.

","The Devil Wears Prada (2006): Dir: David Frankel / Cast: Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, Emily Blunt, Adrian Grenier: Sensational look into the world of fashion but particularly the difficulty in personalities, culture and backgrounds. Anne Hathaway plays a small town girl hired to work for an extremely difficult fashion editor. Director David Frankel does a fantastic job at detailing the fashion industry. Art direction is absolutely exquisite as the fashion industry is envisioned. Meryl Streep is flawless as the brilliant yet difficult fashion editor who conceals her breaking point beneath her job status. Hathaway struggles to adapt to the stress. While her relationship with her boyfriend is threatened due to her being constantly gone, there is a moment where she witnesses her boss in a vulnerable state and begins to gain understanding of her stern and demanding nature. Great supporting work by Emily Blunt as a snide secretary whose ambition is to impress Streep while subduing Hathaway with demands. Eventually even she must marvel at Hathaway's ability to endure. Stanley Tucci steals scenes as he shows Hathaway how to adapt to the business and demands. Adrian Grenier plays Hathaway's chef boyfriend who is growing weary of her schedule and questions their future. The dream job may be the ultimate nightmare or reward but the film itself is a treasure. Score: 10 / 10"

","If you like fashion, if you like women (and/or men) dressing up in the best fashions, then see this movie. If you'd like a hilarious, quick-paced romp then listen and watch closely as the movie is full of twists and turns.<br/><br/>Andi Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a struggling writer that gets hired to Runway magazine by the ""Dragon Lady"" herself, Miranda Priestley. Miranda wants her Starbucks piping hot, her clothes iron, her calls fielded, her needs and whims attended to, much to the dismay of Emily, Andi's co-worker trying to juggle Andi and Miranda. Merryl Streep is fantastic in this one; you can see she relishes being an acerbic fashion broker and you can spot the slightest hint of a smile on her face as she sends Andi on yet another fool's errand.<br/><br/>Sandwiched between the world of high fashion and the demands of Runway is Andi's relationship with longtime flame Nate, who starts losing patience with playing second fiddle to Runway. We see more evidence of the demands as very few in the office are married or in a relationship. Miranda is married, with two daughters, but she becomes divorced late in the movie. Andi loses her relationship with Nate, has a fling with Thomas (an editor and fashion guru) which disintegrates quickly. Quite simply, no one has time for sitting down and talking, life is too quick.<br/><br/>Outside of the bravura acting from all involved, we get some excellent shots of Paris, New York and various fashion galas. It's almost a blur but ends in a brisk two hours or so. A fair warning though, the ending is fairly contrived but does not deter from the overall feel of the movie."

","I watched this movie for about 100 times-I'm a girl and this is a chick flick. The clothes is superb. not Andy's in the beginning though. And I like the music in the movie.

Emily Blunt is also great as Miranda's first assistant-Emily. overall,the movie doesn't bore you and it goes fast. The pacing of the movie is good.I like how they showed that Andy grow apart from her friends because she was in a world they were not event though she didn't exactly change personally. She changed her appearance.The world of fashion is seen as shallow and also full of tricks and cunning plans to survive in it. ""Who wants this life those choices are necessary."" ,says Miranda at one point. But Andy doesn't want this life. Miranda think that's ridiculous-because everybody wants that kind of life. And it is true. The glamour,the luxury,high couture. Women love that. And we would all want it-deep inside no matter how hard we would try not to be superficial. just how the song in the movie says-it's all ""tres,tres chic"""

","Watching ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is one huge pleasant experience. I thought I would end up cutting my wrists since it seems like a typical girl movie with her boyfriend featuring dilemmas like ""does he love me or does he not?"", but no. This film doesn't bother us with boring issues like that, it says much more.<br/><br/>The delightful and friendly Andy Sachs (Hathaway) is an ambitious young lady who just got hired from Miranda Priestly (stunning Merryl Streep), the editor-in-chief of a high fashion magazine. Situation becomes complex for Andy: she loves the job but dislikes the people surrounding it and the influence it has on their lives. Money replaces happiness, fame diminishes personal life, while power and clothes replace friendship and family. Time goes by and that influence soon enters Andy's own life. And in the end she must make the tough choice: deciding who she really wants to be. What and who she wants to matter in her life.<br/><br/>Don't bother trying to find which performance is the best. They are all amazing, with Anne Hathaway proving she's got the chops, Emily Blunt is superb and Meryl Streep as always is incomparable. One more perfect role to remember. <br/><br/>What really got me in this film is the lesson. The ending could be claimed as a wake up call. Undeniably, we all have been or will be in Andy's place. We all have to choose at some point in our lives what matters the most to us. No matter when is that opportunity going to come along, this movie reminded me to be awaken and not let that chance go by untapped. The amount of time and impact my job or other activities will have in my life is my own choice. Am I sure it's really what I want? Is there balance in my life or am I being controlled by my desires and goals to the point where I don't have a life? <br/><br/>It's a simple film about girl fashion if you want to not read too much into it. But it's a great film about priorities if you want to appreciate it. Somewhere around the end, we have the final lesson: the effect of previous choices and mistakes. Here you have Andy wisely concluding with something we all relate to at some point in our lives whether you're a boy or a girl:<br/><br/>""Learned a lot. In the end though, I kind of screwed it up."""

","Is Meryl Streep a real Devil? No, she isn't! She's a professional woman who loves her fame and being in the centre of the media. Most importantly, in her real life, Meryl's relationship has never been a focus in the media. I can say Ms Streep is opposite to Elizabeth Hurley who is seen more like a model although she's an actress since what Elizabeth is wearing and whom she has been going out with are much more focused on than her career in the media.I guarantee anybody who likes Meryl Streep will enjoy the film. Another reason I recommend that people see the film is because people will probably notice the excellent acting of Anne Hathaway."

","The story nicely catches the competition within the fashion industry. It's really a 'dog eat dog' world where one either really loves being so hyperbolic about style and fashion, or forces him/herself to love it and sacrifices so much of his/her personal life. It sure does build on Andy's original character well on the start, and also showed that she's an adaptive person with high sense of initiative. But it kind of raised a philosophical question for me at the end. Can we really say that Andy has a strong will after going through all that and still able to say no and refuse that kind of life Miranda offered her? Or will she be even better if she refused it from the very start? The acting is decently nice overall. Anne Hathaway did quite okay yet she didn't really do well on sad expressions. Meryl Streep plated the ice cold calculated style guru very well, keeping the calm voice intonation almost all the way."

","Chanel. Dolce and Gabbana. Galliano. Valentino. All high end designers in the fashion world. The stuff most girls dream of. The movie The Devil Wears Prada features fashion like this and so much more, along with a lesson to be learned. Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a journalist who comes to New York City to get her big break. Although she has absolutely no style, Andy some how lands a job at the biggest fashion magazine in the city, Runway, where she works as Miranda Priestly's (Meryl Streep) assistant. Over time Andy starts to get the hang of the whole fashion thing along with her demanding job, but she begins to lose herself in the world of Runway. Her long time friends and boyfriend don't know who she is anymore and they feel they have lost her to the monster of the Runway, Miranda Priestly. Andy's self loyalty is tested when she goes to Paris with the Runway team, where she truly has to decide who she wants to be and what world she wants to live in.<br/><br/>This is a movie I believe every girl should watch. High fashion, with a lesson included, teaching the viewers not to lose yourself in something that isn't you. Some of the highlights of the movie included the major make over of the unstylish Andy Sachs. Nigel, her friend at work and fashion guardian angel, brings her into a huge closet type room filled with clothes of all colors, fashions, and designers, and turns her into a new person that fits into Runway. Another fun part of The Devil Wears Prada is when Miranda is giving Andy the most absurd tasks to do. From running to pick up her dog, to getting scarfs, to finding the unpublished copy of the next Harry Potter book for her daughters, Miranda has Andy running all over the city, always on call, tending to her every need. The one part of the movie I found to drag was most of the Paris trip. Although some of the scenes were necessary to make the movie fit together, the politics of the behind the scenes people did not interest me. The boring dinner parties and conferences put me to sleep. The Devil Wears Prada is a movie that I would recommend to anyone who loves fashion or just a fun story. This movie has the glitz and glam of the runway combined with a message everyone should know. So go out and rent it because I guarantee you will love it! (even more then you Valentino pumps)"
"JaysonT","8","0","0","7 August 2009"," Meryl Streep's best performance of the decade
","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is not sheik in how it presents its material- its more pretty and layered. However, the costumes (designed by Oscar-nominee Patricia Field) certainly hold all the weight of a runway show.<br/><br/>This was a film that probably would have been shelved into oblivion had it not been for Meryl Streep being attached to the project. Haven lost a lot of weight, dyed her hair a platinum white, and walking in with flamboyant coats, Ms. Streep seems born to play Miranda Priestley, the fierce and ruthless editor-in-chief of a top fashion magazine. She allegedly based her parody off real life editor-in-chief boss from hell Anna Wintour (from Vogue), though changed her accent to American and toned down her process of dialect to a more subtle and observant tone.<br/><br/>So as much as I loved watching Meryl sink her teeth into her best work of the decade (her line ""Why is no one ready?"" during a meeting is perhaps one of the best line deliveries I have ever witnessed), I couldn't help but cringe at Anne Hathaway's shrewd appearance, whiny manner and consistency of being a royal pain in the butt. I didn't mind Streep (or the great Emily Blunt) bossing the new assistant around because frankly she needed a dose of reality- what would-be New York journalist doesn't research the boss she's going to work for? ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is basically Hathaway's journey into self-identity, complete with a hot boyfriend on the side and irritable friends to boot- as well as impossible tasks to do for Miranda (the best being to fetch the never-yet published Harry Potter manuscript).<br/><br/>Eight stars out of ten ain't bad considering seven belong to Streep. If Helen Mirren hadn't stolen the Oscar that was meant for Meryl in 2006, we wouldn't be complaining for the academy to hand over a third Oscar for the lighter ""Julie & Julia"". But Streep embarks a clean technique in the way she handles the character, presents her anthologies, and dresses the body (Streep probably has NEVER looked better on screen, and she's 56).<br/><br/>So please see this comedy-drama, if only to see Streep and Stanley Tucci teach the less talented Anne Hathaway how to have some true respect for the work force, and also engage in a laugh or to.<br/><br/>FINAL GRADE: A- (all for Streep and the costumes)"

However, there is much more in this movie.<br/><br/>The story of Andrea (Anne Hathaway), a young journalist who can only find a job as an assistant of Miranda Priestly (wonderful Merryl Streep), Runway Magazine's head gives an interesting sight at the fashion world, inspired in the true story of Lauren Weisberger and her experience with the legend Anna Wintour.<br/><br/>Executed with a nice directing, good performers and a very original script by most of the film, the movie ends up being just slightly different from the other romantic comedies, when at the beginning seemed to be much, much different.

","Yes, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is formulaic and predictable and its script has a number of small flaws, but is it a bad film? In my opinion, no, it is not and cannot be a bad film, despite its predictability and other minor faults with the script. To begin with, Streep is always good, one of the greatest actors of our generation, and although I always imagine her more in her real-life persona, vivacious but never over the top, marvelously self-assured without a trace of arrogance, and very natural and utterly unspoilt by success, I can see what a jump it would be for her and a demand on her acting ability to portray the ruthless, hard-as-nails Miranda Priestley, the Devil to Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea Sachs. But she, Streep, does it with all the consummate ease of a truly professional and exceedingly talented actress, which she is. Anne Hathaway is good and portrays her character with credibility and charm and she is well-cast in the film, as are the other supporting actors such as Stanley Tucci and Simon Baker. However, for all this I don't take it too seriously: it is a typically ""chick-flick"" comedy-romance, not Shakespearian drama, and therefore tends towards the shallow but I can suspend disbelief at some of the more unrealistic episodes and instances in the film's script or the original book (which I've not read), as the case may be, and just watch it for the sake of enjoying it, which I most certainly did. It gets four out of five from me, i.e. 80 percent, which is what it's truly worth, again, in my opinion."

","I just watched this movie today on cable, and tried really hard to find it engaging, but the story and characters were very bland. A much more likable and entertaining film on an identical subject is ""13 Going on 30"". It's too bad that the girl's boyfriend is a big baby, and more frustrating that she is equally childish early in the film. I guess that's why I find it less entertaining than a ""Sex in the City"" episode. At least that TV series had some funny and raunchy scenes to anticipate.<br/><br/>As far as Meryl Steep's character, she was a rather good and firm boss. More than once was the line ""do your job"" uttered, which is the minimal job requirement for all employment. Why is this somehow considered too demanding? One would think that Anne's character (who's supposed to be a Northwestern graduate) would be smarter and better prepared for the job.<br/><br/>Anyway, at least it wasn't too long, and was rather painless morning movie viewing."

","I have to admit not knowing anything about Prada, or high fashion, for that matter. The two sections I skip over in newspapers with hardly a glance are sport and fashion. This film is a light-hearted romp about people I couldn't care less about. Actually , that's not quite true because I always sympathise with fresh young people trying to start their careers, and of course Ann Hathaway's character Amy is serious minded enough; she takes the job as Miranda Priestly's assistant and general dogsbody because it might help her get a more serious journalistic job elsewhere. Meryl Streep's Miranda is a hard-driving egocentric monster with just enough charm to prevent her being totally repulsive. People like that, frankly, are to be avoided, especially as bosses. Amy puts everything into the task of appeasing Miranda, even to the extent of endangering her relationship with her nice boyfriend. But she survives, and gets a good reference from the elegant monster.<br/><br/>One interesting point about the Mirandas of this world is the way they bring out the worst in others. Collegiality at work is sacrificed and everyone competes to satisfy the boss's whims. It's not obvious that this leads to a better product; in fact if there's no-one around prepared to tell the boss that her brilliant plans have flaws, disaster is more likely. It's also very wearing dealing with all the unnecessary tension that arises. There's nothing creative about it. Some bosses cultivate fear and uncertainty among their employees (Rupert Murdoch and Conrad Black come to mind), but the usual long-term result is that the good people leave and the organization teeters towards collapse.<br/><br/>The reason why people put up with the Mirandas of this world is of course money. If you can put up with the constant stress and humiliation, you do get to live the high life. But, as Amy, a sensible person, soon realizes, it's not a long term proposition.<br/><br/>It was nice to see an only slightly camp Stanley Tucci as Nigel, Amy's fashion mentor, and Emily Blunt as Emily, Miranda's other assistant is a good foil to Amy's faux pas. Adrian Greiner is cute as Emily's boyfriend Nate, but there aren't any evident signs of acting. Meryl, of course, can do this sort of thing in her sleep, but she puts plenty of panache into her part. You're not likely to fall asleep while she is on the screen."

She accepts an assistant job to the dragon lady known as Miranda Priestley who resembles more Leona Helmsley in personality. She is the editor and power broker in the fashion industry of Runway magazine. Think of it as Cosmo or Vogue. As Miranda, Streep steals the scenes. She can make her vicious, complicated, and then vulnerable. She earned an Oscar nomination (her 15th) so far. Despite the film having more youthful roles for Emily Blunt and Anne Hathaway, Streep shows that she's tops and why. I loved the scene where Andy runs to Smith and Wollensky's restaurant and I have eaten there and have their steak sauce. It's an excellent restaurant. I love the New York City scenery as well. I was disappointed with the scripting of the film. I thought they could have done better and more. Still I love Stanley Tucci as Nigel and the film is entertaining but not much more.

","Or so they kept telling us throughout the entire movie. This movie was very predictable in two ways.<br/><br/>First, Meryl Streep delivers a performance extraordinaire. But what else would you expect. She is an amazing actress and delivers a very understated but intense performance as Miranda Priestly. Her low speaking voice and restrained movements were a surprising way to give a tyrant boss a different facade than the typical yelling and screaming.<br/><br/>Second, it was predictable in that the plot had absolutely no surprises in it. Everything seemed so completely uncreative. It's all been said or done before. Girl moves to the big city, gets a big break in her first job for an industry she could care less about. She dresses frumpy and doesn't fit in. But then she begins to care and starts to become like the people she made fun of in the beginning. She alienates friends and family, all in the name of getting ahead. The only surprise in the whole thing is I'm surprised Meryl agreed to star in such a weakly written film.<br/><br/>Yes, Meryl does elevate the picture and it is worth seeing just to see her interpretation of the character.

Yes, those big eyes and sexy legs caught my attention.<br/><br/>The movie itself isn't that bad. It features some decent humor that is not very common in mainstream flicks. Anne Hatthaway looks very cute and delivers some funny moments because you don't expect a girl like girl running and saying ""shit"" or things like that.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is very sexy and delivers a wonderful comedic performance. She's the second best reason to watch this movie. The main reason has to be without a doubt Meryl Streep. The woman is the most complete and versatil actress ever to grace the screen. She's just wonderful.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is just OK.<br/><br/>The plot has the obligatory moral conscience message and will leave your girlfriend satisfied.<br/><br/>I can't say I enjoyed it but I didn't have a horrible time as expected with it.<br/><br/>Give it a chance if you like light romantic comedies or if you are a fan of chick flicks.

To watch Priestly is to enjoy a bowl of your favourite ice cream free of charge, she is that delicious and scrumptious to see on screen we viewers have simply been given a tasty treat here with one of the finest female performances of the 21st century. Streep's charisma and intelligence cannot be questioned as she dives deep within the character to produce one of the cruellest and dominating people of all time.<br/><br/>Streep dominates the whole film with that fine performance and good support is given by Anne Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) who uses that sweet elegance to create a likable central character. Her character revolves around a few drama clichés but Andy is so likable that you won't care. Sweet and caring it's hard not to associate with her, especially during that first day of work.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt (My Summer of Love) is the character every viewer wants to hate and she does that so brilliantly that you will forget that it isn't Blunt.<br/><br/>Based on Lauren Weisberger's novel, The Devil Wears Prada focuses upon the fashion industry and follows what is now a stereotypical view of models and what happens behind the scenes, which includes models who are size zero, women not getting along and celebrities having fifty cameras in their faces. Stereotypical representations do not always work but the screenplay and direction help achieve a deep dramatic look at the industry and the hardship that Andy has to go through. The film could have easily done without the dramatic boyfriend scenario which was just ridiculous along with the poor climax to an interesting character driven story.<br/><br/>Though these clichés put a damper on the narrative, there is still a charm about this 2006 drama. The feistiness and the grit of the behind the scenes of the fashion industry are occasionally funny and the entire narrative is interesting regardless of its use of clichés"

Meryl Streep gets some amazing lines as does the gorgeously snooty ""first assistant"" played by Emily Blunt. But the dialogue isn't just there to entertain it is also extremely effective in conveying the contrasting and contradictory characters within the film.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway shines as the wide-eyed protegé who begins with high ideals but is seduced by the glamour and excitement of the fashion industry. A perfect choice she radiates innocence and a desire to be genuine whilst forced to grapple with the harsh realities of career life. Streep is another perfect choice in her role as the fashion editor-in-chief Miranda. The ""Dragon Lady"", as she is referred to in the film, is as attractive as she is repellent, making her one of the films many great contradictions, great because they're genuine and all too recognisable in our every day lives.<br/><br/>An engaging, enjoyable and well conceived story, well edited, well choreographed, with a funky, dare I say ""fashionable"", sound-track to boot. I enjoyed it immensely."

","OK movie, not good, not bad. Cliché-ridden but entertaining enough. At least the Hollywood money-makers know to make something watchable from a very predictable and unfunny script.<br/><br/>Character building could have been a lot better. Meryl Streep (Miranda Priestly)should have been brought in a lot more to add drama and evilness to the story. Instead, we see regular glimpses of her, too short to really deepen out the background of her devilishness and make the movie more interesting (and entertaining).<br/><br/>The focus is almost completely on Anne Hathaway, who is an OK actress, but lacking in expressiveness and comic skills.

","This is not an outrageously funny movie, however it does offer a devastatingly effective caricature (or is it a caricature?) of the world of high fashion, mostly seen through the eyes and experiences of Andy (Anne Hathaway), a young woman who takes a job as second assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the cold as ice, hard as nails editor in chief of ""Runway Magazine"" - apparently the world's top fashion magazine. Andy is totally out of her comfort zone. She's not a fashion junkie and she really only took the job to get some experience in journalism. Priestly, however, takes this business very, very seriously - almost a life or death matter, and she demands the same of her staff, whose lives she turns into hell. The caricature of the fashion world is brilliant - a world where loyalty is unknown and friendship is fleeting and artificial at best; a world where (in reference to women's dress sizes) ""0 is the new 2, 2 is the new 4 and 6 is the new 14;"" a world in which Andy (who is very beautiful) is dismissed as ""fat"" because she's a size 6. A world in which Emily (Emily Blunt) - Miranda's ""first assistant"" - is on a diet that allows her to eat ""a cube of cheese"" if she feels like she's about to faint.<br/><br/>Streep was absolutely brilliant in this role, playing Miranda as totally out of control (and totally, icily in control) - a sort of Martha Stewart type of character (even the look and the voice were eerily reminiscent of Martha.) Blunt was almost her equal as her assistant (also icy cold and totally consumed by this dog eat dog world.) I thought they both outshone Hathaway, who was nevertheless quite good, portraying Andy as reluctantly stepping into this world, and then fighting not to become so caught up in it that it ruins her life. In a somewhat understated role, Stanley Tucci was also very effective as Nigel, the closest thing Miranda has to a friend on the staff.<br/><br/>It's not the sort of comedy that will have you rolling on the floor. It's more amusing (primarily because the portrayal of the fashion world seems so accurate) and it's fun to watch. 8/10"

","Heels, heels, boots, heels, heels. The first five or so shots of The Devil Wears Prada (2006) makes up a montage of shoes. Might this movie be about fashion? It seems that way based on the fact that, after the footwear, the camera tilts downward from the top of a street sign somewhere in New York, slowly surveying the entire setting until the view hits the street. Location is obviously important to this film  New York is a huge part of the fashion industry in the United States. A contrast to the expanse of the background, the protagonist is introduced as an ant in the big city. (Several long shots are used to show how the character is interacting with her environment). We follow her, Anne Hathaway of Princess Diaries (2001), as she goes on her way to what appears to be a job interview. Dressed drab, she enters a building that is quite the opposite. It is crisp and trendy and grand. The new ""Princess,"" Andrea, looks lost in a world of know-it-alls, and the Queen of them all seems to be Meryl Streep (Death Becomes Her (1992)). Streep, whose character is Miranda, is the focus of all the fancy, demanding, and receiving, the attention of everyone around her. She is condescending and superior and does not seem to have any taste for the taste of her potential employee. Andrea's hair is down and unimpressive from the time she interviews at Runway, the fashion magazine, to the time she sits down with her friends to dinner that night. She doesn't have the look or the passion for fashion, but this job is something that can take her somewhere. She helps Miranda to realize how much she wants it and that she could be the right person and as they say: ""against all odds;"" the Runway job is hers and the topic of conversation as the next scene is set. Centering on a dinner table surrounded by Andrea and her friends, the scene portrays the lives of young adults trying to get ahead, or at least a job, in the world. The camera circles around the table, as if to show the circles their minds are running around in trying to settle on a career choice. This underlying theme continues throughout the movie, and brings us back to Andrea's particular story. The poor girl is struggling with her job at Runway and making us wonder whether or not she's going to make it. She is being pushed to her furthest limits with Miranda's demanding character. Symbolically, the shoe concept that we saw in the first scenes reappears as this struggle ensues. Shoes are, in fact, the first part of Andrea's transformation, stage one in the process of becoming an accepted member of the company. Nigel, a fellow employee, shows the helpless newbie that looking the part is key  even if you are just doing the coffee runs  and accordingly offers her a pair of classy heels. The Devil Wears Prada (2006) depicts, both in a mocking and defensive way, a world where girls are known for what they look like. The best advice in such a world: Dress well, girls. Be lucky enough to be born with good looks or take your intelligence elsewhere. It won't do anything for you at a fashion magazine. Perfect to exemplify this: Nigel nicknames Andrea ""6,"" which amazingly, is her clothing size. As he says, dripping with sarcasm, ""That's really what all this multi-billion dollar industry is about, isn't it? ...inner beauty."" The Devil Wears Prada (2006) conveys the ways to get to the top  in a career, in your personal life. Particularly, it exemplifies what might be the wrong way to do it. (In an act of foreshadowing, a tub with lifeless mannequins rolls by Anne Hathaway at the beginning of the movie.) It attracts all age groups and keeps them interested, too, encompassing a real-life issue and displaying it in great cinema. This movie is about change, a makeover, and it's about how to determine whether or not the change you've made is the one to stick with."

","This movie has an odd composition. <br/><br/>We get several great performances, with quirky humor mixed with both the negative and positive aspects of fashion. It is fairly shallow, but a major reason for this is because fashion is so shallow. I will absolutely declare that Anne Hathaway's performance as always was the cute innocent boring person who wants to be fabulous, which has gotten beyond painful. She is the main fault of the movie, in my opinion. However, the first viewing of the film she didn't destroy it by any means. Emily Blunt gives a wonderfully smarmy performance of the sassy eponymous character, Emily. Stanley Tucci is also wonderful, sarcastic sharp, without fading. Alas, Meryl Streep performs with such flair, that you can see the wickedness pour out of her. Adrian Grener also gives a fine performance as the ice boyfriend. Sadly, Tracie Thoms and Rich Sommer play boring friends who really couldn't impress you even if they tried. Daniel Sunjata plays the very charming designer James Holt, and the charmer Simon Barker plays fairly well.<br/><br/>The Story, essentially, is fairly well presented from the novel, and although rushed and benign, while it should be more violently set (in terms of feminist approach).<br/><br/>Overall, it had enough for me to watch repeatedly and to like immensely."

","I really loved this movie. For one I really like Meryl Streep and her performance in this movie is stunning, she completes it with her witty remarks, and Anne Hathaway's transformation in the movie is amazing! The actors do a really good job and become their parts well. For parents the movie is alright there are a few sketchy scenes and implications but overall it is alright in that category. The soundtrack is also a plus, the Alanis Morissette song is great, and the City of Blinding Lights by U2 is classic! Please check this movie out, it was worth my time and my money and truly the actors play very convincing roles. It is a really good, cheery movie and it involves betrayal, realization, and love in the plot and storyline. Anne Hathaway plays a girl, trying to get somewhere in New York, on purely good journalist skills but then she realizes to get to the top, fashion has to be involved somewhere. I hope this comment helped you. Enjoy the movie!"

","One of my favorite movies is ""The Devil Wears Prada"". It's a 2006 comedy-drama film, a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's 2003 novel of the same name. Andrea Sachs, who wants to become a journalist, is fortunately employed as an assistant to Miranda Priestly. Miranda is the chief editor of ""Runway"", which is the famous fashion magazine, and she is at the height of her enormous influence on the fashion world. However, Miranda is a despotic superior like a devil! Andrea is not at all interested in fashion, but she aims to study about the fashion and endures Miranda's unreasonable request.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie at the first time, I got really surprised at Miranda's selfish behavior. I also began to admire Andrea's fashion. She is so cool and beautiful! You could enjoy her fashion on each scene. I think this movie is unrealistic, but I think most of the girls can sympathize with Andrea. This is a hilarious and an entertaining movie, so I will recommend you to watch this movie!"
"so_original","7","0","0","1 June 2008"," Follow Your Dreams, But Don't Sell Your Soul
","That is the basic morality message of the film, 'The Devil Wears Prada'. The plot revolves around aspiring journalist Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who takes a job as second assistant to the icy tyrant Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep), who is editor in chief of 'Runway' magazine. The job is both demeaning and demanding, but Andy takes it to ensure her future success as a journalist. But, Andy soon learns that she is sacrificing the relationships around her (particularly with her close friends and boyfriend) and her own values to further her career.<br/><br/>The film's perspective on the fashion world is both negative and positive. On one hand, it seems to say that the fashion business is a shallow and cutthroat industry. Women who wear a size 6 are considered fat, those who wear anything but couture are laughed at, you never question the boss, and be willing to sacrifice your interpersonal relationships to get ahead. That seems to be the opinion of those on the outside looking in. Those that work in the fashion industry see their job as important, fulfilling, and meaningful and are willing to climb the ladder of success (or stay at the top) in any way possible. Even if it means being a mindless slave or stabbing someone in the back. Where the line is drawn and what is the ""true"" perspective is never seems to be concrete, and it is up to the audience, like our heroine Andy, to decide what's wrong and what's right.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Meryl Streep is fantastic as Miranda Priestley. She's not necessarily the lead, but she is the most memorable character. Miranda is demanding and ruthless, impatient and imposing. She never raises her voice, yet everyone is scared of her. Streep is purposely and perfectly understated; both outrageously cold and subtly funny. As a viewer, you loathe and love her all at once. Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci are both humorous and believable as Emily and Nigel ; the former Miranda's neurotic, snot-nosed first assistant and the latter the wise and lovable fashion editor of 'Runway'. Andy seems to pale in comparison to these colorful characters, but Anne Hathway does her best to make her work. She's likable, but a little too naive and pushed around by others (although thats probably the point). But her character did go through the most development, and you see Andy finally gaining strength near the end and the ability to make her own decisions.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the most compelling thing about 'The Devil Wears Prada' is Meryl Streep. Her character proves to be the most entertaining, with Blunt and Tucci tying for second place. However, it is a solid, yet predictable, plot with some funny dialogue. So it's worth a watch."

Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway really she should do more movies together because they worked some great chemistry hear. Alone Hathaway was believable but Meryl Streep takes center stage. She is amazing as usual and it is great to see her experimenting with more interesting characters. I don't think I have seen a movie where she is a villain before this and I have seen her in plenty of movies. (Kramer vs. Kramer doesn't count when it comes to villains.) The story is simple but not dull and some of the wide shots they do of Paris and New York are beautiful. I definitely will be watching this movie again and soon at that."

","There's not much to say that hasn't already been said. The acting, especially Meryl Streep's, is superb. The fashions are wonderful and the story is interesting, especially to one who is the ultimate non-fashionista.<br/><br/>I had a number of problems with the film, not the least of which was the over-use of montage with very loud 'musical' accompaniment. Once or twice would have been fine, but every time Anne Hathaway changes clothes we get a sequence of her walking down the street, or down the hall to a soundtrack that has been turned up to unbearable and that is made up of really gawdawful music. The score, in general, sucks.<br/><br/>**Spoiler** I didn't like the ending. It made no sense and the movie should have ended when Anne Hathaway threw her PDA into the fountain in Paris. The rest was an incoherent waste of time. She makes up with her boyfriend (after schtupping another man in a one night stand in Paris); the boyfriend announces that he's got a job in Boston and they make plans together to go to Boston; then she has an interview with a local New York publication and is hired there, indicating that she will be staying in New York. Huh?? All of a sudden we're in a different movie. That's bad writing and bad film making, and it cost the film two stars in my rating.<br/><br/>Flawed as it is, the film is most definitely worth a look for the acting. Just keep the volume control on your remote under your thumb."

","This film, or rather the book of this film by Lauren Weisberger, is a blatant steal from The Best of Everything, by Rona Jaffe. The film pinches all the moves from director Jean Neguleco's 1959 original to add to the larceny. In the earlier film, Joan Crawford's Amanda Farrow, becomes Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly. In both opening scenes, Hope Lange, aka Anne Hathaway, scans the tall building housing their employer to be. Both display papers with details of their employment and both have identical elevator up and open shots, before viewing the Employer's name printed on the office door / reception. It goes on from there with Streep almost reading Crawford's lines, and certainly her style. What a con! Has anyone else picked up this up?"

Not to say they thought it was Room With A View, but they were pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>My own opinion (I'm 24): This movie would have been a complete throw-away if it wasn't for Meryl Streep. In every way, Streep makes this film what it is--interesting, modern, and sophisticated. Anne Hathaway is of course not hard on the eyes, but it perhaps could have been anyone playing her part. The fact that Hathaway is thin and beautiful does however make it particularly comical when the characters, particularly Miranda (Meryl Streep), call her the ""smart, fat"" hire.<br/><br/>Watch this movie for Meryl Streep.

Stanley Tucci is Nigel, the fairy godfather who helps transform Andy's style, making her ready for her debut on the scene, and Emily Blunt plays the jealous sister in arms in the same position as Andy but with ravenous ambitions. Simon Baker is Christian, the Prince of Andy's career who brings connections aplenty and is hoping to be the captain of her heart and Adrian Grenier as Nate, her long suffering beau dealing with her transformation. <br/><br/>The story plays out exactly as a light version of the classic fairy tale in Haute Couture, with Miranda not nearly as wicked as she could have been (or should have been), Emily not nearly as competitive, and Andy much more single minded, providing a nice little twist at the end.

Only problem was the dreary heroine, with her smug little smiles (obviously has trained on TV - where all emotions have to be underlined, for viewers who are multitasking!). After seeing many British comedies of the golden Fifties, this all seems curiously maudlin - even Miranda Priestley has to have a little secret smile at the very end. This is to show that she too is a good person (in case we didn't understand it from the reference she had given to Andy's prospective employer). However, it passed a couple of hours pleasantly - I assume it did convey the essence of working on a high-powered fashion magazine. Gave it a 7 for a good try, but as usual they chickened out."

","I guess this is the sign of what America likes to read, being that The Devil Wears Prada was based off of a best-seller. People must enjoy their books light and fluffy, convenient and contrived. Well, it doesn't really surprise me, as most of America likes the escapism and ability to spend time with something that doesn't take too much brainpower to follow. Now, I could be totally off base here, but if I am, it doesn't excuse the fact that the movie adaptation is all the things mentioned above. Also, from experience, I know Americans definitely like their movies as low maintenance as possible, so it is no surprise this film did so well. It is a shame though, because there are some nice performances and some moments that truly work, too bad there were also many that did not.<br/><br/>We have the fish-out-of-water tale of a young girl getting a job with the country's most esteemed and vicious fashion critics. Now I understand she was hired because the critic wanted to prove a point with her old assistant, but come on, there is no possible way this girl with no fashion sense and a bit of an attitude against authority could be hired for the job. However, sometimes it is good to have someone on board with a fresh look, so I can suspend disbelief here. Our girl slowly grows into her job, neglects the people that mean the most to her, and begins a journey down the path of a cutthroat career girl doing what is necessary to get ahead. Of course we will be given the obligatory ""a-ha"" moment where she sees what has gone wrong with her life and how she has changed those around her for the better, but even with that knowledge, I still wanted to enjoy what I was watching. I wanted to have fun with the ride no matter how easy the plot was progressing and how obvious. Unfortunately the characters didn't keep up appearances and some moments were just laughable at how specifically simplistic they were.<br/><br/>Give credit to Anne Hathaway for actually giving us what we expect from her role. It is pretty much a rehash of the exact same part from Princess Diaries, but hey, she does the ugly duckling to gorgeous success well. How Hollywood can continue to get away with casting an attractive girl in these cases and call them fat before the transformation, I have no idea. As for the rest of the cast, the real standout comes from Stanley Tucci who steals absolutely every second of screen time he has. The guy makes anything he is in better and no matter how bad the role, he finds a way to redeem it. As far as writing goes, he is given all the great one-liners and nails each and every one, (whether I should applaud the author or screenwriter, I don't know).<br/><br/>Our other two leads, Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep, just did not work for me. I have heard all this great press for Blunt and how her breakthrough performance was top-notch. In my opinion, her character was underdeveloped and a pawn used for the sole purpose to help show Hathaway's rise up the ranks. When the tug of war is no longer needed, she completely disappears from the film because she wasn't needed for anything else. I'm not saying she was bad, I'm just saying the part was a throwaway one. Benecio Del Toro's small role in Swimming With Sharks was more fleshed out and it lasted maybe five minutes, (Sharks, by the way, is a similar talea lot darker and sadisticand much, much better). As for Meryl Streep, what can you say about the acting? The sweet monotone voice while she is turning the knife in the back of all those around her is spot-on, but again, the role just doesn't live up to the evilness necessary and expected. Until her final revelation of espionage, she really wasn't all that bad. Nobody really hated her, Tucci and Blunt continuously defended her and even Hathaway spoke about how she was just real good at her job, and if she were a man, no one would say a thing. Where was this monster I wanted to see?<br/><br/>Now, when it comes to contrivances, you don't have to look far. A friend is trying to make a name for herself in the art world and Hathaway's lust-interest just happens to be there to show the burgeoning love triangle? I don't want to give anything away, but could the car crash have been any better timed as far as tough decisions go? What could have been a nice confrontation between assistants ends up taking place in a hospital without any of the fireworks that would have happened in real life. Also, how about Hathaway always meeting the precisely right person needed at every party/event? If there is a problem for her to solve, she just happened to have been introduced to the person that can solve it five minutes before. It was all just too easy; I couldn't stay bought in for too long before I was jarred back into the reality of it all. I will say, though, that the ending moments were well done and worked in the grand scheme of things. Through everything, the job did make a difference in our lead's life, and the quick moments with Streep and Blunt at the conclusion were nice to see."

Otherwise, it is difficult to relate to people who think having the latest Chanel boots or Valentino dress is of the utmost importance. I don't live in New York or go to fashion shows, so I didn't think the story was all that entertaining. Plus, I was expecting more comedy, but this movie is pretty much a straight forward drama. Plus, I don't like how they take the lead actress, Anne Hathaway, and continuously describe her as fat and hideously dressed. I mean, she is an actress, so is quite good-looking, but not skinny as a model. I think that sends a bad message to 12 year old girls who will watch this.<br/><br/>Streep was great as Miranda Priestly, the tough nosed editor and boss who requires her assistants to do the impossible. Any one who could survive her could handle any job. I was disappointed in that Miranda never really seemed to change to be a little kinder in the end. I kept expecting that to happen. And I didn't like how Andie basically let her boyfriend go like that and hooking up with the first guy she meets in her new circle of friends. And Andie even lets all the high fashion get to her and starts acting like it is so important. So, I guess I was expecting the lead character, Andie, to be more sympathetic, but she wasn't.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: It was OK, but it is definitely a drama and doesn't really have comedy thrown in. I recommend it only if you like Anne Hathaway or want to see all the cool clothes people wear in this."

Yes, Meryl Streep is a great actress and she did a credible job here - enough to hold my interest. It's not like she had a lot to work with here - the character was largely a cardboard cutout - but she made me pay attention.<br/><br/>One problem the film had was with its basic premise. Ho ho ho, the characters say, how could someone who looks like Anne Hathaway expect to work at a magazine like this? Uh, maybe because Anne Hathaway is an almost ridiculously good looking young woman, and is the kind of person whose face looks as if it was designed specifically to go on the cover of a magazine? Yes, she's not as skinny as a stick like some models, but she is thin, and when the characters talked about her like she was some ugly duckling it completely took me out of the moment. They should have either cast another actress (although that would have been a mistake because Anne's a good actress) or toned down the dialog.<br/><br/>Stanly Tucci was good as always. Adrian Grenier was fine, although didn't have much to work with. Emily Blunt was adequate.<br/><br/>But overall the movie just didn't connect with me. From the first scenes I could predict almost everything that would come, and I don't mean that in a good way.

","David Frankel, a rather unknown television director makes his debut on the silver screen in this stunning adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's not so stunning novel, The Devil Wears Prada.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep join a mesmerising cast in this surprisingly brilliant rom-com. The premise is simple and kept that way to ensure all detail is carried across in depth without missing any major points from the novel. Weisberger should be astounded that Frankel managed to turn her rather lacklustre book into a first-rate movie.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway plays 'Andy Sax', an unknown journalist with no eye for fashion who wants to get her foot on the bottom ladder of the media industry. Her character simply leaps off the screen, from her dopey, lovable personality to her cheap, second rate clothing; she is truly a joy to watch. Emily Blunt plays the fashion conscious assistant who would do anything and everything to get as high as possible in the clothing industry; again, her character is played with a love/hate finesse that few actresses of 2006 can match.<br/><br/>However, by far the best performance is given by Meryl Streep as 'Miranda Priestly', editor and chief of 'Runway' magazine. Sly, career obsessed with a dash of emotionality added in, she is exceptional in her role and should be seriously considered for an Oscar at this years awards. Her dialogue is spoken with a heartless brilliance that no other actress could even hold a candle to, she is perfectly cast in this role.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci plays a somewhat flat member of the team, possibly due to his little screen time, but he is by no means dull, with personality abound.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is genius, and perfectly matched to the film, from the outset right up until the closing credits, each song is flawlessly integrated into the feature. Camera-work is also on par with the best of this year and really helps the characters stand out in their roles.<br/><br/>Where most rom-coms use cheap gags to gain laughs from the audience, Prada expects you to think a little more about what you're laughing at, a deep message about ones self discovery is incorporated, but well hidden in the film. Of course there are a few laughs of the cheap kind, but unusually, they are actually funny. Comedy really doesn't get much better than right here.<br/><br/>Some scenes in the film have been directed so well, that the more emotional among us may be reaching for the tissues. The transition from comedy to seriousness is exceptionally watertight, you'll be laughing one minute and on the edge of your seat the next.<br/><br/>The ending of the film is perhaps of a slight anti-climax, but it portrays a wonderfully deep message about inner emotion, leaving a huge smile on your face as the credits role.<br/><br/>To put it simply, The Devil Wears Prada is a practically faultless movie which should appeal to a huge and diverse range of people. The acting, direction and soundtrack are all absolutely perfect and I think we may have a found a future classic character in 'Miranda Priestly.' It's a joy to watch. Be a devil and go see it."

","The movie was cute for what it was... But as far as being anything like the book, it is not. There are so many differences between the book and movie I couldn't even name them all. The movie basically follows the same story line and that is about it. The characters don't have the same occupations, and a few of the characters were invented for the movie. There were huge pieces of the book that were missing from the movie, and those pieces of the plot are what made this movie a little deeper than just a fashion show. Like I said, I thought the movie was cute but many of my friends who read the book hated the movie. Watch it and decide for yourself! :o)"

","Devil Wears Prada :Want to get ahead- figure you need to sacrifice your current ambitions by serving as an intern or taking less pay in your chosen field or tolerating a boss from hell.This movie is about one girl's challenging year as a personal assistant to a notorious Dragon Lady(Miranda Priestley as played by Meryl Streep).The movie is supposed to be a comedy- and it does provide some laughs- but also a ton of cringes and moments of deja vu- as you watch the main character (Anne Hathaway) continually subvert her own personality and values and social life to try and keep pace with the world of high fashion and her over-demanding underpaying boss.I have worked for several folks that have been described as bad bosses- and usually they are not so terrible- just demanding-but in the case of the main character in this flick - I would have loved to see her slip and fall(and not just on the gag reel)-Streep does a good job portraying such an unlovable and ambitious character- and she overwhelms the picture- so the whole coming of age story arc seems predictable and boring by the time it plays out for Anne Hathaway's character.The supporting actors do a good job filling their slots-Stanley Tucci as the high strung homosexual copy editor,Emily Blunt as the vicious,jealous and browbeaten size zero clacker,the African American female artist as the Wanda Sykes character,etc.The movie wants to be an homage to fashion- but it continually pokes fun at the absurd diets and meticulous habits of the denizens of Runway magazine.Not the over the top comedy I thought it would be- but a decent movie about finding how much you are willing to sacrifice to achieve your goals with a few chuckles thrown in.It is disturbing that a gal like Anne Hathaway is called fat or not skinny-even if it is in a movie about fashion.The DVD has a commentary track,deleted scenes and a gag reel.Worth a rental.

","Surrounded by a certain hype months before its release, The Devil Wears Prada is actually better than one might think. It has a lot of charm, some fun and is a clever portrait of work relations. Meryl Streep, as expected, delivers a sublime performance: her Miranda Priestly never falls into stereotypes like the crazy, loud, profane boss. Miranda's poison is subtle and elegant. Her screen presence is so magnetic that is hard to point out Anne Hathaway's and Emily Blunt's merits - even though these two young actress might hold their characterizations with some dignity. There are some good twists and interesting supporting roles - with the exception of Adrian Geirner as Anne's inexpressive romantic interest. The Devil Wears Prada becomes close to banality at the very final scene, when everyone smiles and live happy forever and ever: it's a somewhat pathetic finale for a film so sharp and witty in its depiction of the fashion world."

","Unfortunately this movie is doomed to stay underestimated both by critics and blind audience. Many will claim it as ""shallow"", others won't miss an opportunity to stick a label of cognation with other movies. In reality this movie has much more to deliver than an attempt to entertain a spectator with one more story of a ""girl from suburbs"" who is so charming/smart/loving that she has no other choice than to become eventually Cinderella. In my opinion this really good movie's main idea is that EVERY person that crosses our way comes in our life intentionally (may be to teach us something if we are smart enough to understand that). And that everyone (even one who looks so distant, arrogant and naughty at the first sight) can become a friend and guardian if you try to understand and care about that person. Some episodes (no wonder those with participation of amazing Meryl Streep) will probably never leave your memory (""I said myself - go ahead. Take a chance. Hire this smart, fat girl..."" or the conversation in a car in Paris). The only role that actually left me a bit disappointed is that of Emily Blunt. She was a bit too much..."

","A savagely funny script and deliciously sour performance from Meryl Streep headline 'The Devil Wears Prada' and helps make it this year's darkhorse surprise. Combining fashion with comedy to terrific results, it's one of the years most enjoyable and entertaining films. A chick flick, yes, but one that the men can enjoy just as much as the gals.<br/><br/>Andy Sachs could care less about fashion, she just wants to make it in the world of journalism. Her quest takes her to the prestige and high-profile Runway Magazine, where she applies to become the assistant to the magazine's editor, Miranda Priestly. A brutal, sharp-witted, and strong-willed woman, Miranda sees something in Andy despite her being in over her head, something that leads to her hiring. Andy's soon plunged into a world completely foreign to her, and with the help of her fellow co-workers Emily and Nigel, Andy learns the ropes and comes to adapt to her new way of life. The question is, will her newly found fashion sense and lifestyle come between her and her friends? Her boyfriend? Will she leave them all behind for Miranda, the magazine, and a chance at a lavish career? 'Prada' is such a lively film, so sharp and intelligent. It quickly sets a tone that's both classy and satirical in nature, making it one of the year's most refreshing experiences. Because most of all, it doesn't matter who you are, 'Prada' is a one-size fits all kind of film. You don't have to be a fashion insider, or even a romcom fan for that matter, it's customed especially for you. The laughs are sophisticated rather than slap-stick, and they're all so effective. No doubt thanks must be given to Lauren Weisberger, the author of the source material, but it's Aline Brosh McKenna who pens this remarkable and brilliant script. Direction from David Frankel, who very appropriately has had experience with TV's 'Entourage' and 'Sex in the City', is impeccable. It only stumbles when it's not quite sure what it wants to be in the second half, losing some of its biting humor and dabbling a bit too much in the romance department. But all can be forgiven, because the majority of this project is pure bliss.<br/><br/>It's been said a million times already, but I can't go without saying how Meryl Streep is the complete and utter backbone of 'Prada', I don't think the film would have existed without her. The art is in the delivery, from the way she underplays her many sharp-witted one-liners to the way she carries herself, every move precise and calculated. It's one of her best performances, and if it wasn't for Helen Mirren, I think we could have seen her march away with Oscar in hand this year. But alas, Streep's magnificent performance will still go down as one of the genre's best. British newcomer Emily Blunt also gives an exceptionally strong performance as the ambitious-driven co-worker, her bitchiness just perfect. Though overshadowed, the beautiful Anne Hathaway is wonderful and elegant in her starring role, and Stanley Tucci and Adrian Grenier hold down the tent for the men in fine fashion.<br/><br/>There's very little not to like in 'The Devil Wears Prada', everything comes together to form the year's smartest comedies. All thanks to a killer script and superior performance from Streep. It's a light and fluffy piece of work, one which would certainly hold up for repeated viewings. There's nothing in 'Prada' that couldn't be predicted from the opening frames, but it never lessens its pure and genuine entertainment. 'Prada' is a film with sass, a joyously sinister look into the high-class world of NYC and the fashion industry. It can't be missed."

","In this delightfully delicious skewering of the high fashion magazine industry and Anna Wintour from Vogue specifically, we follow Andy (Anne Hatheway) as she gets a job as 2nd assistant to Satan personified, Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep, in a perfectly chilled performance). Miranda can be none other than the spawn of Satan, because a real human could not be so nasty. Andy, who wants to be a journalist, looks down on the fashion conscious, just as they mock her size 6 body (""Size 2 is the new 4, Size 6 is the new 14""). Eventually to get ahead, she embraces the fashion industry, works all hours to please Miranda, offends her boyfriend (Adrian Grenier) and her friends and starts to lose her soul, nearly becoming an apprentice devil. As happens so often in movies, she realizes what is really important, walks out on her job and gets a poor-paying, unglamorous job at a real newspaper. I could have done without the ending, but the rising to the challenge of working for the devil was fascinating, and excellently accented by Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt.<br/><br/>This movie is like a minty devil's food brownie, with a lot of mint to impart a certain icy quality to it. The rich, decadent devil's food calls irresistibly, making one want to partake a little more, a little more until you are filled with chocolaty goodness, and your taste buds are almost numbed by the mint. Inside you are feeling perfectly sinful while barely able to sense what is in your mouth, numbed by excess and willing to continue eating. 7/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies"

She conveys the main part of a ruthless and down-to-earth, business-like shark of the glossy mag with such admirable precision that an awe arise immediately. The bags she has, the expensive clothes she wears, the comments she makes, the house she lives in - everything is so first-class, so impeccable, so grand. Her part is a real feast of the film. She delivers her lines with cold snobbish aplomb, but deep in her heart she is a loving, caring Mom and she teaches her new aid so patiently and well that it can't but gives an admiration.

","The Devil Wears Prada showcases two stars, Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway. Mrs. Streep Portrays Miranda Preistley, CEO of Runway Magazine and a woman of refined character that has built her life using whatever it takes in the Game of life. We never truly get to know her character but see fragments of her abilities in the High Fashion world. She is a Bitch and she knows that being a Tough Bitch is the Key in making it in her Career. She is most definitely the Devil. That's if Corporate Capitalism and the dollar is the True Hades Dweller that the holy book alludes to. Miranda Priestly is beautiful and mean, shrewd and experienced...Meryl Streep is given three scenes to really showcase her acting. She defines fashion and we have her attention. Her performance as Mrs. Priestly will become a film note for sure. She is cruel but a good woman in love with power and fashion.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway portrays, Andrea (""Annie"") a Northwestern Graduate who has landed a Job at Runway Magazine as 2nd assistant to Miranda Priestly. The Lion and the Lamb. There is an innocence emitting within Hathaway's character mostly expressed in her rosy cheeks. The transformation she goes through is expected and comes along well and is refreshing. She defines to look within oneself and see how beautiful we can become especially in the art world of fashion where individualism is expressed purely. We welcome her transformation as Hathaway is captured beautifully at times in exquisite dresses. The black dress even received recognition from envy as Annie's boyfriend unconsciously reacts to her epiphany. Annie is a confident Graduate who states; ""Well, that would not be fair."", when a High Executive advises her to quit after being shrewdly told she was a dumpy fat slob by Mrs. Priestly.<br/><br/>The weakness in the film lies in the script. The plot is predictable and a silly subplot about a takeover distracts from the character development. It would have made a great film had the writer examined the two lead characters more where each one has something to learn from the other. It was not clear if Miranda Preistly learned anything from Annie. She never became self aware of her pompous behavior and gave in to the aspect of life that the other side was cool. Then again Thats the Devil.<br/><br/>Annie did the job as a Northwestern Graduate would do. Perfect! She is out to prove to the world she can do anything. She walked away from the high fashion world displaying confidence and experience. She saw the ill effects of such a career as sex and corruption, betrayal and deceit, let alone the missing drug abuse would have consumed her. Her first ski lift would have taken her into that lust pool where the Devil flourish's and smiles pompously and shrewdly at her while she caves into desire. However, The film goes to fluff and remains a fun family film without getting to absorb in seriousness. Annie is the angel that showed us how to beat the Devil when she or he or it appears in our life.<br/><br/>Love thy enemy and help them."

She is a good actress, and always makes each part she plays believable. Meryl Streep was wonderful as the bossy, conceited and demanding, controlling boss and editor of a High Fashion magazine. No one's life is their own when they work for high profile big wigs in business. One really gets a small taste of the mad rush to get everything together, and on her desk when she wants it. Pressure is exerted on everyone. People vie to work for Meryl Streep, and Anne comes in as just someone who needed a job, and did not even know what kind of business it was. It has many laughs, and astounding behavior from these fashion moguls that fancy themselves more important then any other people, but also shows the side that is the dog eat dog life style that is really repugnant to most people. It was funny in spots, has romance, and some very intense moments where you find yourself talking to Anne to get out of that business, who needs a boss that mistreats you and your time is never your own, she keeps her running hither and yon and only to do her bidding.

Wherever you turn to in the Prada universe, something happens. The fantastic Merryl Streep shines as Miranda Priestly, the magazine editor from hell, and Anne Hathaway marks her way cautiously into becoming the next Julia Roberts (or the next ""it"" girl at the very least), after a starring in a string of kiddie hits (The Princess Diaries 1-2) and a quick breast flash (Brokeback Mountain). The story is your basic ""small town girl hitting big city life"" cliché, but it's carved with so much glamor and style and fashion and wit  you'll soon to be caught in the act as well.

She meets(at first)little help from her immediate peers at the magazine,particularly Miranda's established assistant Emily(Emily Blunt,with some of the best lines in the movie)and Nigel(Stanley Tucci,shaved and stylish),and has to rely on her savvy,determination and charm to try to work the job to her advantage.

And the added potential romantic entanglement that comes in the form of a renowned journalist(Simon Baker)seems kind of forced. The amount of times that Hathaway's character is referred to as either ""fat"" or ""ugly"" by people around the office,while understandable coming from the obsessed-with-skinny-tanned-and-chic fashionistas,still is galling. To be honest,the whole fashion industry theme of the film pretty much chased me away from seeing this in the theaters,and had Ms.Streep not been nominated for an Academy Award,I'm not sure I would've rented this DVD while it was still a ""New Release"". Still,this movie is entertaining,mostly on the backs of Streep,Blunt,HAthaway and Tucci,with help from a sharp script by Arline Bosh McKenna(adapting off Lauren Weisberger)and direction from David Frankel.

","Some people think that this world of glamor exists. It is located in a remote galaxy named the United States, on a solar system named New York, and more precisely in the center of planet called Manhattan. The inhabitants of this world seem to be obsessed with their clothing and they do not behave very nicely to citizens of other galaxies.<br/><br/>Maybe the life of those aliens is interesting for some folks, but it is not for me. The action of 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a little bit more than a sitcom, but not much more. 'Sex in the City' without the sex if you see what I mean. Actually David Frankel directed a few episodes of 'Sex in the City' and his skill in filming New York and love for the city is visible.<br/><br/>It is not that horrible as a film though. Meryl Streep is always fascinating to watch, although half of the screen time is spent in showing her in various closing for no longer than two seconds. In the other half she succeeds to create a female executive character that is strong and credible, one percent human and 99 percent not, you feel like you may have met her in the board room of any American corporation. The Oscar nomination seems a slight exaggeration though. I was not too impressed by Anne Hathaway, who is playing the principal role of the young journalist trying to make a career as PA of the famous Streep, opposing integrity and humanity to the she-devil. It is maybe because it's hard to be a female actress in the shade of Streep, or just because big eyes do not automatically make you an Audrey Hepburn. The role I actually liked more was the one of Stanley Tucci as the slightly effeminate and affecting editor, charming and self-ironic in the right doses.<br/><br/>All these save the film from being the complete disaster the conventional story deemed it to be, but cannot raise it above the threshold of mediocrity. At least thanks to it and to wikipedia I now know what Prada is :-)"

","That Meryl Streep has been Oscar nominated for a role in a movie like ""The Devil Wears Prada"" simply speaks of her unique talent as an actress and of lots years and experience in the business to choose the right characters to play. I would have preferred a nomination for her work in ""A Prairie Home Companion""; it would have been a tribute to Robert Altman. But true: the presence she had there isn't comparable to the one she has as this devil.<br/><br/>Miranda Priestly is the name of the non-human (is the best expression I can think of) character Streep portrays. Fortunately for her, the movie makes clear that Miranda is not human and it constantly finds a new example so we can see it on screen. So when Andy (Anne Hathaway) arrives to be this devil's new second assistant, a job apparently 'a million girls would kill for', she makes very clear that this is just a normal job for her, because she takes work seriously and she wants to be a journalist.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, Miranda ruthlessly throws her a bunch of activities that the most prodigious mind couldn't even remember instantly; and she just tells Andy. That's the way things work at ""Runway"", the important fashion magazine where Miranda is the queen. Emily (Emily Blunt), the devil's first assistant (yes, she has two), gives Andy an explanation of the routine on the first day: ""You just stay on the desk and pick up the phone, you can't move if I'm not here"". ""But if I want to go the bathroom?"", Andy asks. ""You can't; once a girl chopped her finger with a stapler and had to stay because the phone was ringing"".<br/><br/>Two days later, Andy goes to her 15-minute lunch break and when she has chosen her food, Nigel (Stanley Tucci) comes and says she must leave it because Miranda has called and she always arrives fifteen minutes early. When Andy gets to the office, Emily yells at her because she has to pee and she's been holding it for ten minutes. This people can't even eat and they talk almost exactly the way I'm saying they do.<br/><br/>What happens is that Andy wears old sweaters and long ugly skirts her boyfriend (Adrian Greiner) loves but that are not classy enough to work in a fashion magazine. Plus, she doesn't care about fashion and she says it out loud, which apparently is a crime. In one scene, Miranda looks at one of Andy's old sweaters and gives her lesson about its origin and about how it relates so deeply to fashion. That one-minute talk alone is worth Streep's Oscar nomination; because in the film's heartless world, she shows no heart.<br/><br/>I haven't read Lauren Weisberger's novel, but Aline Brosh McKenna has adapted a work that ended up in a script that has no sense of reality at all. I repeat: a person doesn't work like this, a person doesn't talk like this, a person doesn't live like this, a person doesn't do or say these things. David Frankel directed the film the same way; showing the million different outfits the wonderful costume design offers and shooting each night event with all the glamour and style. It didn't help; I became completely aware of it when the picture introduced an incredibly dreamed character played by Simon Baker.<br/><br/>All the cast is exceptional really; it has young British talented actresses, it has Tucci at his best form, it has Anne Hathaway delivering well (and most importantly showing that she's not a vehicle actress and she can do different things) and of course, Meryl Streep. The plot line takes a turn at some point and it becomes shamefully predictable; but it occurs when you don't care about these characters anymore."

","The best comedy I've seen in years.<br/><br/>Let's start from the beginning because I found nearly everything about this movie utterly perfect.<br/><br/>The script is sharp and fun, never boring and brilliantly written, there's never a whole, not one scene is too long and the dialogues captured me.<br/><br/>The directing by David Frankel is very good and overall smart, in portraying the world of fashion to make it sparkly and captivating inall its pretence.<br/><br/>The costumes are like special effects for this movie and well, if you're a girl (or a gay guy) you'll find yourself drooling in front of the screen over shoes and jackets like my girl was.<br/><br/>But the acting, oh my God! The acting in this movie is like a perfect dessert. Anne Hathaway is absolutely adorable, she is believable and she does a great job achieving to stand out in a group of superb actors. She is the only lead, however, who in my opinion deserves a negative critique: she could have pushed herself much more forward, I felt like she was playing it really ""safe"" while she could have added a much sharper gap between the pre and post-runway Andy. Emily Blunt is the rising star of the movie, I've always had a thing for British actresses (and red-heads) and, seeing Emily for the first time in this movie, I was totally captivated. She is a superb characterizer, she steals the scene, she is funny, inventive and has an unbelievable screen presence, she is going to go far. Stanley Tucci is one of my favourite supporters, he's given a character here that most actors would have overpowered, letting Nigel drawn in the sea of stereotyped gay characters. However Tucci's capable hands gave Nigel a sharp tongue and a big heart, despite the appearance. But the absolute queen of hell is the always wonderful Meryl Streep. When you think of Meryl you usually think of drama, deep emotions and most of the times tears. She's stepping out of her element here, this performance was calculated, cold and always balanced, like Letterman said commenting the movie ""it's like that club you never have to reach for, but you know it's there""; yet it is impossible to completely hate Miranda Priestly, Streep gives her a touching fragility as we see her as a woman and mother and not as the overruling boss of Runway, she gave up too much of her life for her job to let anything or anyone step in her way, ""If you want this life, those choices are necessary"".<br/><br/>Watch this movie, you'll laugh a lot, you'll think a little and you'll find yourself smiling at the end of it."

","I may be missing something in this film (I suspect that my gender excludes me from the target demographic) but I saw it receive almost universal gushing praise on release, so thought I'd give it a go. And? Well, it's really pretty average, overall. Actually, in fairness, it can be looked at in two ways. First, the bad. The plot is flimsy, the message obvious, the structure by the numbers. It is a glam episode of Ugly Betty, but with no ugly people (at one outlandish point Anne Hathaway is called ""fat""?!) stretched to just under two hours. Nothing surprising happens at any stage. However, it is worth watching thanks to the good bits  the cast. Hathaway is very good and very watchable, if not massively convincing when in the dowdy phase. Emily Blunt and Meryl Streep, on the other hand, are both tremendous, with Streep excelling, and deserve the plaudits they received. Stanley Tucci is a little one dimensional, but also very endearing in his role. On the whole, this is an average film in which not much happens and is meant for a female audience, but the acting is of a high calibre so film fans in general could do worse than give it a spin."

","I myself have never really been a fan of fashion type movies, but anything with Meryl Streep is well worth a watch. I must say I was pleased when watching ""The Devil Wears Prada"" because Streep is so good in this role of a wicked witch New York city fashion magazine editor(Miranda Priestly). I can always see that Streep always takes her roles serious and she puts every ounce of heart and soul into it, making her perhaps the best actress around. This story is somewhat Cinderella like with a smart hard working Ohio girl(Anne Hathaway) who arrives in New York City with high hopes and dreams, but it's not going to be no yellow brick road journey when she lands a job as magazine assistant to the wicked Priestly! I know that all of us male or female can say that we have worked under a boss like Miranda Priestly who's so cold and demanding. All of us at some point have felt used and abused and the Hathaway character experiences the same slave treatment and cold shoulder many of us have felt. Yet because of ambition and determination and a little luck success and happiness is possible. Just like the Hathaway character we learn to look back and miss the tough nature of hard and dedicated love from bosses like Miranda, because the cold nature and tough love only helps us in the ever competitive world. Anne Hathaway gives a fine performance you just root for her underdog role, and good supporting roles are provided from Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt. Mostly this film has the light to shine because of Meryl's strong and no nonsense performance, as always Streep is a pleasure to watch she gives so much to her characters."

","In the cut throat competitive world of retail, fashion, business or just life, the human toll taken to be the best is summed up in The Devil Wears Prada. This is an amazing movie adorned by the polished shark-like performance of Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, fashion aficionado and shark extraordinaire. Hemmingway wrote, ""He had come up from deep down in the water...he had come up so fast and absolutely without caution...."". In other words, in Machiavellian language, ""Never let the sharks see you bleed"". Streep is as cold and calculating a shark as ever was created on film, but she bleeds in private - what a knock out she is as the successful queen of the size 2 and shrinking Runway. This movie is wonderful because it portrays women getting ahead but paying a big price for success. Ann Hathaway is strong in her role as the idealistic journalist who gets sucked into the fashion world mystique, but not entirely. Hathaway brings a softness to this movie, just the right touch of humor. I suspect The Devil Wears Prada is more than a movie based on a novel. Indeed, I'm sure this educational plot about success is a reflection of life in the glossy fashion lanes of New York and Paris. There are likely thousands of size 2 and smaller trashed runway outfits hanging in consignment stores to prove just how pricey this story's moral really is. I'd like to give the extraordinary acting by Streep and Hathaway a 10 rating - their performances are exceptional. As for the sub-plots, they can be somewhat confusing, especially the fling in Paris, so the 8 is my overall rating."
"oliver-123","7","0","0","10 February 2007"," Not a great film, but a great performance
","This is, as every comment has surely noted, a tremendous performance by Meryl Streep. She creates a character who is, basically, monstrous, even though at one point she shows vulnerability, just for a while before the armour goes back on. Whether the real life models for Miranda Priestly are quite this tyrannical and demanding I do not know. If there is a flaw, it is that she comes across as almost too beastly: there is no real suggestion that she has the charisma to inspire the (often fearful)loyalty that she gets. Nor do we really get an insight into her motivation, except perhaps the implicit suggestion that she *has* to behave like this to maintain her position, maybe that she fears if she does not, she will be dethroned. The film is subtle in suggesting her limitations - she cannot conceive of anyone not wanting a position like hers - and in giving her the comeuppance she deserves by having Andrea walk away, to give her ""her biggest disappointment"".<br/><br/>The film really centres on her much more than on Andrea and the rather moralistic story of her temporary seduction by and final rejection of the world of fashion. In general, I found the characters wholly caught up in this world (Emily and Nigel) much better realised than Andrea's 'normal' friends. Her boyfriend, in particular, is hard to get a handle on, and he is given one of the more questionable lines. In my view, Andrea did *not* do the job just for the clothes and shoes and bags, and it is unfair and narrow-minded to suggest that she did; surely she did it to ""show them"" - that she was competent, that she could handle anything Miranda could throw at her (even if she needed help once or twice). It could be said that, in giving him this line, the film is offering too simplistic a choice between workers in the fashion industry who starve themselves to get unrealistic, dangerously thin figures and so are 'bad', and 'normal' near-slobs (we never see the boyfriend in anything approaching a stylish getup, that I can recall) who are 'good'.<br/><br/>But for all its imperfections this is worth seeing, and maybe a little more realistic than Ugly Betty."

","Predictable as hell, but produced and directed in high style and anchored by a central performance (Meryl Streep's) that is revelatory, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is well worth your attention. A young woman (Anne Hathaway) with journalistic ambitions goes to work for Miranda Priestley (Streep), the notorious editor of a Vogue-like fashion magazine. We're told that Streep is a monster from the get-go, so Hathaway's mission is to last longer than her boss's previous assistants. Will she or won't she? As I said, this is predictable Hollywood trash, but it's amazingly entertaining trash because Streep and her supporting cast make the absolute most of the stock situations. Characters follow their pre-destined trajectories and arcs and everything is tied up nicely. Director David Frankel keeps the energy levels high and steps lightly over potentially heavy-handed dramatics at times. Streep, who was born to play this role, amongst many others, keeps her tongue in her cheek and takes full command of her artform."

You have the Ice Queen (Meryl Streep) Miranda who hires her anyway, and you have the Lady in Waiting (Emily Blunt) who is well qualified to succeed in a world that she's been brainwashed to believe is the Holy Grail. But, as far as movies go, we know who will win who over, who will move ahead, and who will graciously agree to step aside while the underdog has their glory.<br/><br/>What makes the difference is the characters. Stock as they are, ""TDWP"" provides us with two characters who actually take themselves seriously...Streep who epitomizes the 'don't mess with me kid' persona, and Blunt whom you actually give a damn about.<br/><br/>So, for that reason, see ""The Devil Wears Prada.""

","Fresh from college, Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) comes to New York in hopes of being a journalist. Instead, she accepts a job as a personal assistant to the demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), editor in chief of the fashion magazine Runway, who forces Andy to compromise her ideals if she ever wants to make it in publishing.<br/><br/>One of the most pleasant surprises of the year, The Devil Wears Prada is a wonderful comedy that will work for everyone. The screenplay is simple yet still engaging and it really relates to anyone who has had a mean boss in their lives. If you don't like fashion, that's okay since fashion is really just the backdrop to the story. The first half of the film is consistently good with many funny lines and scenes. It then slows down a bit and it becomes more serious. The sudden shift in tone is unexpected yet it is still handled well. The ending is kind of disappointing but not in a alarming bad way so it doesn't subtract from the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>Director David Frankel did an okay job behind the camera although he did keep it safe so the movie was pretty predictable. There were also a few things I didn't like about the film. The relationship between Andy and Nate was handled poorly and the two of them did not go well together. The ending wasn't very good because of the outcome of their relationship, it just felt unnatural and they should have just been friends in the end. The other thing was the message of the movie. It kind of felt like they were saying, ""if you can't beat them, join them"". I don't think the film really showed that you can be yourself and still succeed at any job unless that wasn't the point. However, I still think that was the point since the screenplay actually had some depth to the characters and I'm hoping it wasn't a shallow film.<br/><br/>The acting was great with Meryl Streep being the highlight of the movie. She was fantastic as Miranda and she deserves an Oscar nomination. Anne Hathaway was also pretty good and she manages to keep up with Streep. Honestly, some of the performances were a bit over the top and Hathaway had to give a subtle performance in which she delivered. Emily Blunt was good as Emily although I don't think she deserves a Golden Globe nomination. It was a funny performance but a little too over the top and not a role that demanded too much from the actress. She was better in My Summer of Love. Simon Baker was just creepy and I didn't like his performance at all. Stanley Tucci was great and it was refreshing to see that his character wasn't just an annoying stereotype. Adrian Grenier was alright although he didn't look too good with Hathaway. Overall, I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada. It was very entertaining and it's worth checking out. Rating 8/10"

","Being a journalist is just hard work, and all the glamour of the fashion industry is merely trappings to any professional. Obviously a Hollywood film is not going to take that approach, and will focus on everything that is not central to the task confronting the editor of a very expensive publication. The Devil Wears Prada makes appropriate fun of the dedicated Miranda Priestly (get the play on words) and yet soon our heroine gets sucked into her workaholism and is shaping up to be a good professional editor herself, before she has a sudden, unexpected aneurism and dashes deliriously across the Paris traffic, experiencing convulsions that cause her to throw her cellphone/mobile into the Art Nouveau fountain. Back in New York, still having some kind of breakdown, she hallucinates meeting her perpetually three-day stubbled boyfriend (a short-order cook by trade) and has a vision of Miranda across the street. Then she walks out of the picture leaving us pretty confused as the credits roll. What about Miranda? Well, she just had to keep at it, didn't she --- after all, the show must go on. They splashed a lot of money on this picture, but it's a groupie show and doesn't make any telling points."

She makes outrageous demands that have to be carried out immediately and within time limits, otherwise the people in charge of running the errands could be fired.<br/><br/>She is very outspoken and honest and not afraid to speak the truth about what she thinks about someone. Andy, however, puts up with the unconventional and humiliating requests from Miranda because, she is told, if she lasts a year in the position she could land any job she wants, even the journalistic one she desperately wants.<br/><br/>As Andy adjusts to the position, she starts to change. From a young woman with no sense of fashion who always had time for her family and friends, Andy becomes career obsessed as she pays more attention to her job than anything else.<br/><br/>Ultimately Andy realizes that she must make a choice between her family and her friends and the job she has worked so hard for, as she starts to become more and more like the woman she despises working for.<br/><br/>The film is witty, funny and clever. There is not much you can't like about it. The characters are great, with the actors delivering solid performances. Meryl Streep portrays Miranda brilliantly as the wicked person she is and Anne Hathaway is as sweet as ever as Andy Sachs. The two have great chemistry together.<br/><br/>The film does not follow the book by Lauren Weisberger very closely, but is very good none the less.<br/><br/>The Devil Wears Prada is not the best comedy of the year but it is definitely worth seeing.

Also, we knew she was going to get a makeover from the moment she was dissed for not being fashionable.

"naun","7","0","0","21 December 2006"," The real Cinderella
","What we have here is essentially a remake of the Cinderella story, this time transplanted (aptly enough) to the world of high fashion. If the result isn't exactly fresh it is still smart and fast. It features, in Meryl Streep, the most delectably wicked of stepmothers; and of the fairy godmother, more later. They all get to go to the ball, which means flying to the big show in Paris, but in this telling it's not the prince but Cinderella who has to choose. As the downtrodden young heroine Anne Hathaway does creditably enough, treading the line between wide-eyed and streetwise. It's the princes, the true one and the false one, who don't measure up, and the lack of a believable relationship with either of them deprives the movie of even the modest moral tension that a fairy tale should have. The regular boyfriend is so bland and nice he might as well be played by a muppet, and he practically is. As the plausible but, wouldn't you know it, deep down sleazy alternative, Simon Baker assays Hugh Grant territory. But if Hugh Grant's (or, before him, Alan Alda's) career trajectory tells you anything, it's that the public has to hate you for being nice before it will like you for being a cad, and Baker hasn't put in the mileage yet. In the end, Cinderella does the right thing: after witnessing a coldly calculated act of betrayal, she leaves the world of high glamour and goes to work for a metropolitan newspaper, where, as everyone knows, such things never happen. One critic remarked that just once he'd like to see a picture where the heroine gains fame and success *and* finds a way to stay true to her conscience. It only later dawned on me that The Devil Wears Prada does indeed have a character who does just that. In the role of Nigel, the sage and devoted offsider, Stanley Tucci warms the film without oversweetening it. Watch the scene where he thinks that, at long last, his long years of loyal service are about to pay off. His is a Cinderella story within a Cinderella story, and it's where the real heart and soul of the film is to be found."

","though this movie was a bit predictable, you know, at first she cant handle the job but then she gets a make over and does well, then she becomes a ""glamazon"" i mean, yes predictable, there are so many just funny slap stick lines in there, so many fun little bits and movements and looks, that really come from all the actors (not just Meryl Streep) Though Meryl Streep is, i think, the greatest actress in movies right now, i don't think we should credit the entire movie to her. Yes she is phenomenal, but Anne Hathaway has a very quiet acting style. But I think Emily Blunt is just as good, or even better than Anne Hathaway. She is my favorite character (other than Miranda of course). She has a certain air about her that makes me laugh every time she comes on the screen. Also, on the more negative side, i think the major flaw in the plot is Andy's friends. they keep getting mad at her and fail to see that Andy (until the very end) still wants to be a journalist, and that she needs to do well for Miranda to succeed her dream. If her little boyfriend really loved her, he would have understood. Also the comedy mostly comes from specific lines, ""gird your loins"" for example, but the one line that i think has nothing to do with anything is when Andy is talking to Christian Thompson, she says ""if Miranda were a man, no one would notice anything about her except how great she is at what she does"", where did that come from? Sure i am a girl, and i believe in womens rights, but i don't think that line was necessary. Nobody elaborated on the subject at all. But yet, that doesn't ruin the movie. through everything, the movie is still one of my favorites to watch, though i skip through parts i don't like (most scenes without Streep)."

","With ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" there's finally a comedy geared toward women that is about career and workplace problems, not just romantic complications. Granted, most of us aren't personal assistants to universally renowned, universally feared fashion magazine editors, but the movie works well as a wish-fulfillment fantasy mixed with a ""be careful what you wish for"" message. The movie's central questionwhether naïve Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) will give in to the ruthless, manipulative ways of her boss Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep)certainly doesn't apply only to the fashion industry.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" does slip into romantic-comedy cliché too often for it to live up to its potential. It makes it seem like there are only two available, straight men in the world for Andy to choose from: her scruffy chef boyfriend and a famous, smarmy writer, neither of whom are very interesting or likable. In fact, the movie suffers whenever it shows Andy's old friends: these characters are just as judgmental as the denizens of the fashion world, but much more boring.<br/><br/>The workplace scenes are fresher and more lighthearted, full of eye-popping fashion, scheming competition, and Miranda's outrageous demands. There are good performances from Emily Blunt, as a snooty but neurotic fashionista, and Stanley Tucci, as the sympathetic art director who gives Andy her obligatory makeover. (At heart, this is a movie about temptation, and the loads of free designer clothes that Andy gets would be enough to tempt anyone.) Hathaway has trouble making Andy's extreme naiveté at the beginning of the movie seem believable, but once the character comes into her own, the actress does too.<br/><br/>But Streep, as Miranda, steals the show. Though her delicate features and soft voice might seem innocuous, Miranda is ultra- perfectionistic and cunning, with a sense of world-weary entitlement. Yet we're allowed to see more than her devilish exterior: the movie wants us to realize the sacrifices that Miranda has made to get where she is. It is a testament to Streep's performance that at the end of the movie, you feel not elation that Andy has escaped the Devil's traps, but a kind of pity that Miranda is caught in a trap of her own making: doing her job well requires her to be heartless. Her trademark designer sunglasses and chauffeured car may shield her from the ugliness of the outside worldbut they also imprison her."

But soon enough, Hathaway is transformed into a fashionista, and she quickly alienates her friends and family. The film is right out of the Disney or Nickelodeon school of film-making, and doesn't begin to live up to its arch title, which is based on someone's memoirs. Hathaway is pretty but just not up to her role, which would have called for someone like Sandra Bullock 10 years ago. Today, it might have been better served by someone like Rachel McAdams.

Anne Hathaway looks at all times like an uncomprehending cross between a young Liza Minnelli-faced puppy and a lobotomized, siliconed and puffy-lipped Audrey Hepburn clone.

A number of reviewers claimed that Emily Blunt, who played Miranda's assistant, Emily, stole the show. I have to disagree with this view. She did a very creditable job of playing the self-promoting competitor to Andy Sachs, played by Anne Hathaway. But I do not think that she upstaged Anne Hathaway's character. Still other reviewers claim that Stanley Tucci, who plays the role of Nigel, stole the show, but I believe this also to be false. Anne Hathaway's character, Andy Sachs is, without a doubt, the focus of the show as intended."

","A young wanting to be a journalist or some other writer decides to take a job at a high profile fashion magazine because she can't find anything else. Having no eye for fashion and not being a skin-over-bone model herself she falls out of place quite badly there. Add to that the head editor that is in all senses of the words a *censor bleep* from Hell and it becomes clear where this will go.<br/><br/>A rather thin story for a rather thin film. There's a good couple funny moments and just enough buildup to make people able to like the lead roles just enough to care for them, but for the most the film falls on its behind pretty badly anyway - it just doesn't add up together like it should. This is just another melting pot of ""a whiff of comedy, a drop of drama, a taste of self deprecation and a smell of reality"" and with that it is just another thirteen in a dozen film.<br/><br/>Not bad, not good, just right in between."

Her boss is such a bitch that she keeps everyone around her in a perpetual state of panic. Everyone in the company, the assistants, the accountants, the lawyers, etc, spend as much if not more time obsessing over their appearance and starving themselves than the models do. The boss has trouble understanding a failure to achieve the impossible, but if you actually achieve the impossible she will greet it with ""That's all"".<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway looks good after she's cleaned up."

","Although books like 'The Devil Wears Prada' do not capture my attention, I finished it before seeing the movie. And having watched it, my impression: a fine work of the director and screen writer.<br/><br/>Instead of dwelling on the actors' performances, I will try to explain why I prefer the movie to the book. Forgive the lengthy review :)<br/><br/>First, it is intriguing to see Andrea's boyfriend change name and occupation: from Alex the teacher to Nate the cook. Why so? The book Alex is very devoted to his pupils, which is similar to Andrea's zeal to please Miranda. Yet in the movie we barely see Nate's life. In my mind, it is a clever go, so as to show how different from each other they become. Also, Nate's occupation in food industry (especially *fast* food!) works as a perfect opposition towards the fashion world, in which food is hardly included at all. First we see Andrea belonging to Nate's world, but later she starts to tread on Miranda's grounds, entering the merciless fashion world. And then it is up to her to choose where she wants to remain.<br/><br/>Then, Andrea is quite different in the movie than in the book. Perhaps it has to do with the first person narrative in the novel, which makes story-telling a bit partial - therefore, we are given the judgement of events instead of working it out ourselves. The movie gives us a view from aside, thus leaving space for our own feelings and Anne's acting skills. Also, subtle plot changes make Andrea's personality appear in a new light: instead of going with the tide, she makes her own decisions. It is she who decides about going to Paris instead of Emily (in the book, there was no other way). She decides to take a break from the relationship with Nate (though it originally was Alex's suggestion). It is she who succumbs to Christian's charm spending a night with him (while in the book she only slightly responds to his flirt). She steps to a whole new world, which is fairly conceivable. I doubt many persons, especially women, would resist its glamour. Moreover, the frantic trying to warn Miranda about the latter being fired shows that Andrea actually cares even about the woman and sincerely wants to help her. And having made all those decisions, she is able to make the final move - step away.<br/><br/>And of course, Miranda. Needless to mention, Meryl Streep's performance is breathtaking, yet I will elaborate on the character she plays. In the book, Miranda Priestley is a cruel and merciless person not caring about those whom she has to deal with. Even in the episode when Andrea and Miranda are conversing in the car, the latter's remark about Andrea reminding her of her young self is taken offhandedly and adds up to Andrea's anger. Having read the book, the boss's character seems inhuman, which had me confused and unnerved. I believe that pure evil exists only in fairy tales, and in real life we always get both of them together, the goodness and evil. Now, let us regard the movie version of the cruel witch. First, Miranda is shown as a human capable of grief, amusement, affection, and, above all, self control. Although she does not gives up tossing her coat over the assistants desk and deliberately calling Andrea 'Emily', there are many episodes depicting her genuine reactions to the surroundings. Say, the amusement at Andrea taking care of the HP books. Then, the fantastic scene in Paris, when we see her devoid of makeup and obviously stricken by grief. Her pale face and bare feet contrast with the former graceful and elegant Miranda, and after hearing the news of divorce, we see the secret of her strength. Andrea's inquiry about what she can do to help is answered by ‚Your job'. I believe this is the key to understanding Miranda - one has to do one's job. To survive and go on under any circumstances. This proves Miranda is not indifferent to Andrea - the girl is competent to do what needed, and Miranda appreciates that. Then, the movie version of the car episode. Same phrase, different communication. Andrea is definitely more sincere and natural, genuinely replying that she would never be like Miranda, and the older woman explains how Andrea has been unconsciously following in her footsteps. Why tell this? Laying out the simple truth and the future possibilities, Miranda is presenting Andrea with an opportunity to choose. Does she want to wander further and perhaps become the next Miranda? Andrea makes her choice. The two women take different directions out of the car. Pulling oneself away is so much easier than it was for the book Andrea. I love it how smooth the separation is. No swearing, no telling off or running away - merely the different paths.<br/><br/>And finally, the episode that I found the sweetest, the aftermath, the meeting of the ex-princess and the queen. Andrea's wave and a shy greeting smile characterizes the girl more than any other episode. She is very different from the person in the book. Much simpler, more sincere, less arrogant, and way cuter. What does she receive in return? A slight incline of the head, and later, within the car, such an affectionate smirk. Which characterizes the movie Miranda even better. Still superior, still the lady perfection, but nothing of the ice queen. Never believe there are persons impossible to approach, because sincerity and a well-wishing attitude can get you to anyone's heart. Even if this anyone is Miranda Priestley.<br/><br/>I say this movie is about choices. About a Cinderella who chooses not to follow the path to royalty. About a girl who unconsciously chooses to warm up the others around. And about the not so evil witch who has chosen her own way of life and still continues to do so."

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is probably one of the best movies in it's own genre. <br/><br/>This is actually a movie about Andy's path of finding herself. And at this absolutely colorful fashion world, even she, who swore that she'll never change, starts to slide on her way. A simple girl starts to dress herself up, knowing more and more about fashion. This also mirrors a world of typical teenagers (although Andy is past that phase already) nowadays. At one point they are sweet and innocent, simple girls and on the next moment they are hooked on shopping, clothing and fashion. This can't harm, but if you start slipping more on your way and changing, you might not get out of there. Probably Miranda Priestly was something like that when she was younger, but she slipped. Her eyes were on the prize too much. She built a career, but she also started to wear a mask, letting go of her true self. She became ""the Devil"" - always so tough on everyone, she gained herself a reputation of cold-hearted woman. But at one point she slips, she drops off her mask and let's herself go. She let's Andy to witness that moment. Let's her know that deep inside she's just like everyone else. <br/><br/>Very wisely picked cast for the movie. You could almost call Meryl Streep as ""The Grand Old Lady"", who gives a wonderful and strong performance as Miranda. And opposite her they have given a chance to Anne Hathaway, who is one of the best young actresses in Hollywood right now and who has already showed her skills that have improved more and more since ""Princess Diaries"" and ""The Brokeback Mountain"". The meeting of old and new fabulous actresses. Also I was very surprised to see Simon Baker (Christian Thompson) playing on the movie. I noticed that charming Australian at the very beginning of his career on small Australian series. I knew that he had broke his way to America, but seeing him on ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was very pleasant! <br/><br/>And I can't stop without mentioning what a great chosen soundtrack for the movie. Each song just perfectly filled in the back. You could just hear those lyrics and they perfectly reflected the situations and thoughts of the characters on screen. This has happened very rarely. It just flew through me!<br/><br/>I definitely want to get my hands on the DVD when it comes out and maybe I'll even read the book :D 9/10"

There is no intention to make this she-devil a complex person. She never raises her voice, just works with faces, glimpses and ways to say her lines. It's like an instruction movie about making a mean comedy character.<br/><br/>But once again, everything is so very clever, until the plot gets too eager in moralizing and doesn't want the audience to make its own judgments (which has been really easy that far).

","I went to this movie on the strength of the trailer and the clips I'd seen. This was something of a mistake. Not because these are unrepresentative of the movie, but because there's really nothing more to the movie than these clips, and others like them. Bitching and beautiful frocks is about all you get. For most of its running time it's a pretty joyless movie. It's not particularly funny. You can get some limited pleasure from seeing Andrea turn from fashion ignoramus to designer-clad stunner. The story, though, is hackneyed and predictable. Andrea's friends aren't fleshed out at all, and the movie lacks any texture or depth. And yet, I do think they did a good job of drawing it together towards the end. Her ambivalence towards Miranda is nicely done, and the flashes of sunlight from Miranda and Emily make you come out with the lovely illusion that you've seen a good movie. But I emerged to a serious rain storm, and being stuck in that, more or less safe under my umbrella, was much more exciting than anything in the film."

"MaxBorg89","8","0","0","23 October 2006"," A sharp, poignant comedy, driven by a terrific script and a towering central performance by Meryl Streep
","Meryl Streep has a wonderful gift: she is one of the few people in the world who can take any role in any movie and play it to perfection. And even though she's best known for dramatic parts (Kramer vs. Kramer, Sophie's Choice, The Deer Hunter), she can shine in comedies as well. The latest example is The Devil Wears Prada, where she delivers another Oscar-worthy turn.<br/><br/>She plays Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway, one of the most prestigious fashion magazines in America, and is famous for her tyrannical attitude and continuous demands. Unfortunately, her new secretary, Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway), doesn't know this when she first sets foot in the office. Once there, though, it doesn't take her long to realize that working for Miranda will turn out to be a nightmare. Especially if you're a naive young girl who knows absolutely nothing about fashion...<br/><br/>Andy has to face the truth: she's a fish out of water in this world where a size 6 (hers) is the new 14, everyone wears clothes they don't even like, as long as it's expensive and gorgeous, and the high point of the year is going to Paris and meet all the big personalities. As for our ""ugly duckling"", she really struggles to fit into that universe, with some support from Miranda's gay assistant Nigel (Stanley Tucci, absolutely hilarious) providing comfort between the impossible assignments, whether it's finding a manuscript of Harry Potter 7 for her boss's twins or booking a private flight when all regular airlines are blocked by a storm.<br/><br/>First-time director David Frankel (who previously worked on Sex and the City) approaches the fashion world with a poignant eye, showing it for what it really is: populated by cynicism and appearances, with just an occasional glimpse of unexpected humanity surfacing here and there. Instead of pandering to mainstream rules, Frankel and screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna keep the movie mean, and therefore relentlessly fun, until the end. By doing that, they provide us with one of the year's best comedies, given increased value by some deliciously quotable dialogue (""...You have no sense of fashion.."" ""I think that depends on..."" ""No, no, that wasn't a question"") and memorable acting: Hathaway manages to gain the audience's sympathy thanks to her simple charm and unpretentious behavior, while Tucci turns what could have been an annoying stereotype into a likable, genuinely amusing supporting character, yet they're both second to Streep's impeccable, mesmerizing work. If the film's great, it's largely due to her.<br/><br/>Want to see something truly, undeniably funny this year? Make it Clerks II. Something less risky and profane? Then watch The Devil Wears Prada."

","FILM REVIEW: THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA Cast: Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway; Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci Academy Award winning performance from veteran actress  Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>The Devil wears Prada has set the benchmark for riveting entertainment. This five-star effort is devoid of the irksome hindrances of CGI effects and demolitions forays. In essence, here is a film with nothing but superb acting performances from its fantastic cast. The story is credible; the characters are multi-dimensional and the script is masterful.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep plays a cruel, unemotional corporate executive, who is both feared and reviled by those she works with. As CEO of a leading fashion magazine, Miranda Priestly's character is anything but her namesake equivalent. Her no-nonsense approach to fashion industry dealings and her treatment of employees bears testament to the cut-throat world of corporate America. Her outwardly calm demeanor and soft-spoken manner belie her ruthless comportment, in direct contrast to the insouciant character of Andy Sachs, her assistant, played by Hathaway.<br/><br/>The story tracks the exploits of a carefree gal named Andy who wants to follow her journalistic ambitions. She applies for a position at the fashion magazine and much to her surprise Miranda Priestly is instantly charmed by her. Their business relationship rapidly develops and Andy soon excels at her craft. Naturally the job is exceptionally demanding and the hours are insane. The story tracks the metamorphosis of the typical girl next door into a remarkably gorgeous woman.<br/><br/>The trade-off is high but the dream is real. This story is a window into the real world; a world of deception, manipulation and at times inanity. The characters learn to conform to the norm and in so doing foregoing their individualism. Stanley Tucci delivers a fine performance as Nigel  Miranda's right hand man."

That said, Meryl Streep plays a monster so brilliantly that I can't help but be in awe of her performance, and everyone else does an absolutely sound job; there is fortunately little by the way of stereotype and I'm glad I've only ever met one person in my life who would be at home in the type of world displayed here (and he was a total idiot).

","In 2003 a small book named ""The Devil Wears Prada"" by the then unknown author Lauren Weisberger, came out of nowhere and surprisingly reached the top of the New York Times bestseller list becoming the proof that this new genre fiction named ""chick lit"" was here to stay. However, more than its literary style, what made Weisberger's novel suddenly popular was the rumor that this fictional tale of an insanely capricious boss was based on the real life experience of its author while working in Vogue magazine under the rule of the editor-in-chief, Anna Wintour. Wheter Weisberger really based her book in Wintour is still open to debate (Weisberger denies it), but the book's huge popularity soon ensured a film adaptation, and the legendary actress Meryl Streep was the once chose to play the Devil dressed in Prada.<br/><br/>The film is about young Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), who fresh from college, gets a job as personal assistant of Runway magazine editor, the legendary Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), famed for being a powerful influential figure in the fashion industry with little to no regard to those under her command. Andy, a complete foreigner to this environment, will have to put up with her eccentric boss and her insane capricious demands. To make things worse, as Andy begins to discover the industry she'll have to make choices, as her past life begins to feel incompatible with her new career.<br/><br/>While the screenplay (by Aline Brosh McKenna) remains relatively close to the source novel, it's fair to point out that it has several (probably necessary) departures from the book's plot, making it a simplified version of the story. Still, the movie keeps the overall themes of the tyrannical boss and the choices of life, as well as the charm and freshness of Weisberger's book. However, due to this simplification of the plot, it becomes a bit predictable as it has a lot in common with many other similar films (""Swimming with Sharks"", 1994, for example) about a young newcomer being bullied by a mean boss.<br/><br/>""The Devil Wears Prada"" is director David Frankel's first theatrical feature film, however, it's by no means his first important job, as Frankel perfected his craft directing several episodes of the famous TV series, ""Sex and the City"" (also inspired by a ""chick lit"" source). In many ways, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" retains the feeling of Frankel's previous work and it's probably the obvious next step in his career. While it may not be the most original film ever, it has quite good features, such as a very good edition (by Mark Livolsi) and a well-selected soundtrack.<br/><br/>Many words have been written about Meryl Streep's excellent performance, so I'll just say that she was perfect for the role, as she gives a deeper, more complex personality to a character that essentially exist to be mean. While Streep's performance is essentially what makes the film to stand out from other similar movies, credit must also go to Anne Hathaway and Emily Blunt, who play Miranda's two main assistants. Hathaway as our main character, Andy, delivers a quiet, subtle performance that allows her character to be likable, specially as her actions begin to show the slow but constant effect that Miranda has in her. Emily Blunt is the film's best surprise, showing a great future and a big talent for comedy. Finally, Stanley Tucci has a minor role, but shows off his scene-stealing abilities and makes gold of every moment he appears on screen. The rest of the cast is quite effective, but nothing really as special as the four main characters.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that the film's worst problem is the many similarities it shares with other films, as it gives the feeling that the story lacks originality. However, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" makes up for this flaw with its light-hearted tone and its big charm, as it's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously (as other similar films do). Also, Frankel's past directing a TV series becomes too notorious at times, making the film look like an extended chapter of a TV series; however, this is not really as annoying as it sounds, and it's probably due to the act that this is Frankel's first feature film.<br/><br/>""The Devil Wears Prada"" is quite a good film for a nice evening, it's charming, funny, and most importantly: entertaining. It's always a joy to watch a very talented actress at work, but it's also a joy to discover three new talents (Hathaway, Blunt and director David Frankel) having a chance and making a good job. It may not be a life-changing experience, but this devil is a nice surprise. 6/10"

You knew ""The Devil Wears Prada"" was going to be a smash.<br/><br/>Flick to the next morning's takings reports, and there it is: already at #1 in Australia.<br/><br/>Nearly $5 million in less than a week. Juxtaposed, perhaps poetically, at #10 is the somewhat anti-corporate ""A(m) Inconvenient Truth"", taking less than $2 million in 3 weeks - still quite successful in Australian terms.<br/><br/>Had Meryl Streep, however, done an Ali Gore and toured down under in sync with the film release, then ... . Well, let's just say no one would be mangling her or her film's name.<br/><br/>While Gorat has hogged much recent cellulo-political intriguing, Streep has shown a whole nother generation why a good few ""oldies"" regard her as their all-time favorite actress. Academy Award nomination a-coming? Plus possible mon cherie.<br/><br/>3 or 4 significant others at the acting nucleus of the film might also be honor-bound. The costumes are of course par excellence (and the product placement shameless), the storyline funny and flowing, the one-liners pearls.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway's transformation from anti-fashionista to butterfly is unforgettable. The catalyst for that is an amazing little speech from Streep. She nails the young high fashion new-chum (and would-be rebel) when said rebel smirks over apparently pedantic deliberations concerning an outfit color scheme.<br/><br/>Hathaway (and we) are then astringently advised of the hand-me-down place of unwitting anti-fashionistas in the greater scheme of (clo-)things. The ""coloring"" theme of Streep's rebuke is the history of the particular shade of blue in Hathaway's sweater.<br/><br/>I loved the soundtrack, but you may not. Madonna's ""Vogue"" gets a tickling, and you can't help but cast your mind to the managing editor of ""Vogue"" magazine when it does. She who some point the finger at as the ... base ... character for Streep's role.<br/><br/>That character - Miranda Priestly is her story name - is a little different from the one portrayed in the best-selling ""' Devil Wears Prada"" book. In the latter, they say, she is a ruthless monster with absolutely no saving grace. The Hollywood version romanticizes her up a couple of moral notches. She's still a hellcat, but with a dash of humanity.<br/><br/>Even Hathaway feels that dash: she sternly tells a (Streep-loathing) suitor: ""If she were a he rather than a she, you'd be admiring 'his' business instincts, instead of reviling her as a 'bitch'"". Or words to that effect.<br/><br/>Which is probably meant to be one of the film's poignant moments, and it is. It may not, however, ring entirely true for the film audience. Many of us will seamlessly segue Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street"" to Streep's noughties version of the complex corporate anti-hero.<br/><br/>The latest film is definitely worth a look, regardless of your interest in the consumer high-end. Douglas's Gekko fetched a following, irrespective of a particular interest in high finance. Miranda Priestly could easily finish up as a similar - if more fashionable - type of icon."

","This movie is really about a young and inexperienced person doing a very tough job. It's about hard work. It's about finding fulfillment in working up to the demands of an extraordinary task-master, who works just as hard, if not harder, as everyone else who works for her. The boss lady, Miranda, sacrifices just about every relationship in her own life to run her fashion magazine her way, which is to make it the very best it can possibly be. This is her choice and she expects it to be the choice of anyone who works for her. It someone wants to work at a lesser level, then go work for someone else. It's New York. The young assistant, Andrea, finds herself in a job that's both beneath her career expectations and yet, way over her head. Early on she is not competent at her job, but she gets there. She begins to understand her job and understand her own capacities. She grows enormously under some very tough teachers. Her friends, on the other hand, and this is particularly true of her pretty boyfriend, don't like this change in her. Actually, they can't keep up. They are terribly judgmental and offer her very little understanding. Her girl-friend loves the fine and expensive accessories that come to her through Andrea's job, but is quick to condemn the changes she thinks she sees in Andrea and viciously attacks her verbally. These friends, who are very quick to condemn their friend because she is committed to doing a good job, remain ambitious for themselves. If they worked for a task-master such as Andrea's boss, would their own work reach a higher level? Or, would they sacrifice their own careers just to remain the same chummy pals they've been? As I said, this movie is about hard work and the fulfillment one can receive from working at the top of one's form. Hurray for Miranda, and for the growth we see in Andrea."

","I don't even know if you could call the original source a novel. It was pretty much the author venting about her days at Vogue and thinly disguising it. There was no character development, it was way too long, and Miranda Priestley was just a cardboard cut-out of evil.<br/><br/>The movie is a totally different animal. And that is a good thing. It brings perspective to other characters in the novel, Nigel (Stanley Tucci), Emily (forgot the name of the actress) and especially Miranda (the one, the only, MERYL STREEP). The screenplay cuts out many plot lines from the book and mainly focuses on Andy's relationship with Miranda and the fashion world with occasional glimpses to life she's slowly leaving behind.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway makes the most of a rather thankless character who we just as use as a guide into the fabulous world of ""Runway"" rather than look at her as a real person. Which, believe it or not, is a step up from the book which portrays Andy as a complaining brat. The supporting cast is spectacular, the movie is beautifully shot, the clothes and jewelery are incredible, and the soundtrack is great. There are many fantastic one-liners that you won't get in the over 300 page book.<br/><br/>The montages and wardrobe are worth the price of admission alone. Do yourself a favor and just watch the movie instead of reading the book. It is MUCH more rewarding."

","As everyone has commented, Meryl Streep's performance is amazing. I also thought Emily Blunt was fantastic. The plot itself is full of holes and the relationship between Andy and her boyfriend is dealt with too marginally to be convincing. The acting and the direction, which is pacey and visually exciting, outweigh the flaws, though.<br/><br/>There are some serious themes in there as well, mainly how far people sacrifice ethics and personal life to corporate success. Also a very interesting question is raised in the film by Andy (Anne Hathaway, looking very Audrey Hepburn-ish in the later sequences)- would people really find Miranda's behaviour so remarkable if she was a man?"
"Mxzplk","Null","0","0","7 October 2006"," An infernal actress: Meryl Streep is the best (but not the only) reason to watch the poisonous The Devil Wars Prada
","In the ultra-rarefied environment of the big-world and prêt-à-porter for the rich, there is a consensus that few people rule more than the London native Anna Wintour, publisher of the American magazine Vogue. With an wave of the head or a plait of the lips she makes and unmakes entire careers, imposes or bury collections and infuses happiness or sadness in the soul of a co-worker. It consists that Anna doesn't just chooses the place that she herself will occupy in the auditorium of the great parades; it is said that she chooses where her disaffections will sit, so they won't see or be seen by her. To incarnate such formidable personality is not a task for anyone. Actually, David Frankle, the director of The Devil Wears Prada (2006) found the only person capable of doing it - Meryl Streep walks by the corridors of the fictitious Runway magazine like Catherine the Great on way to her crown ceremony and fusillades subordinates with the unpleasantness of a hard line soviet director. Meryl is a delight: an actress with no rival that puts everything she knows to service a character which no one has guts to rival against.<br/><br/>The film is an adaptation of the homonym best-seller, written with a lot of humor and clear spirit of rematch by an Anna Wintour ex-assistant, Lauren Weisberger. The book, tells of how a recently graduated journalist, Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), change her ideals for a job as a punching bag for the publisher of Runaway - and also for a closet worthy to contemplate at least the lighter modalities of faustian pacts. Every morning, her boss, baptized in the original version as Miranda Priestly, enters the office and pours the purse and coat over the head of the assistant, because is too prepotent to deliver it properly on the hands of the girl. For months, calls Andy for the name of her other assistant, Emily, because judges that she hasn't conquered yet the right for a separate identity. And, day after day, tortures all around her with censorship delivered in a tone of voice almost unheardable. Lauren swears that Miranda is not a mirror of her ex-boss, but is her invention. Not that anybody believes on it. Miranda, is true, has a silhouette of a woman, and not an X-ray (like the writer Tom Wolfe described the extremely thin new yorkers girls of the superior stratus), and her hair is white-silver, instead of the dark hair of Anna. But the proof that the fashion world knows that Miranda is Anna is on the several ""griffes"" that didn't want to collaborate with the dressing of the film, fearful from reprisals from the Vogue.<br/><br/>Meryl and the venom of the plot are not the only right hits of The Devil Wears Prada. In general, movies about the world of fashion portrays their integrant as idiotic people and triflers, that only thinks in superfluous things when there are so much serious things going on on the planet - is the case, for example, of Prêt-à=Poter of Robert Altman. This condescension is absent in this film: David Frinkel knows that people like Anna Wintour, John Galliano or Karl Lagerfield, despite the exotic visual pose, are executives that makes decisions with global ramifications and have corporate responsibilities in the order of billions of dollars. People, at last, that in each clothes, footwear or accessory that wear have to signalize your specific form of power and extension of your net of influences. To see this environment portrayed in this form is refreshing. And the clothes, in fact, are to kill for."

","There's a lot to like in this film not least the gloriously anti-PC stance; in a world where employers live in fear of firing a female employee who is clearly nine and a half months pregnant it's refreshing to see an employer who thinks nothing of TELLING rather than asking her Assistant to obtain a copy of the new UNPUNLISHED Harry Potter novel by four pm or not to bother coming back to work (and the 'work' is on a Fashion magazine, the Potter book is for the boss's kids)and when, against all the odds the Assistant places the book on her desk at the allotted time the boss merely says 'ONE copy? but I have twins, do you expect them to cut it in half? Only to be assured by the Assistant that she has had two FURTHER copies bound and delivered to the twins in question. Perhaps the best thing about Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) is the way she is able to intimidate any and everyone by NOT chewing the scenery a la Crawford and Davis but merely employing a look of disdain or at best a low, well modulated voice. Bitchy one-liners abound and we think immediately of Mank's All About Eve and A Letter To Three Wives and for George Sanders in the former we have Stanley Tucci here who, as horrified as everyone else by the total lack of fashion-sense displayed by Andrea (Ann Hathaway) offers her a pair of stylish shoes to replace her own drab one-step-up-from-trainers and when she rejects them by saying 'Miranda hired me and she knows what I look like' his response is 'But do YOU'. The fourth stand-out performance comes from Emily Blunt as Hathaway's predecessor who can't believe people like Andrea exist but nevertheless helps her get a handle on the job. Ironically this hymn to sophistication opened in London on the same day as Marty Scorcese's (who wouldn't know sophistication if it bit him in the ass) in-yer-face The Departed; two movies, two Hollywoods, two different worlds. Unlike most of the Hollywood stuff I've seen and enjoyed recently - Sideways, The Station Agent, Garden State - I have a feeling that this entry WILL hold up on a second viewing."

","The fashion industry: The giver and taker away of all things ""in"" and religion to every insecure, under-fed teen girl (and sometimes guy) in the western world is given a right smack (but never more so than that) in David Frankel's sometime satire. Anne Hathaway plays Andy, a smiley young girl who moves to New York in order to move up the fashion world. Her goal is journalism, but her right of passage is through assisting the cold, maliciously cruel fashion editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep, doing a po-faced Cruella Deville). She soon realises that the industry is cruel, shallow and incredibly undignified. Will she fall foul of it's devilish charms and superficial face, or keep her charm amidst a glamorous indecorum?<br/><br/>The fashion industry, at its worst, is absolutely monstrous. It gives birth to terrible self-indulgence, unhealthy lifestyles, immoral role models and hideous insecurity. Whilst The Devil Wears Prada does its best to caricature the embodiment of the fashion world, by having Miranda Priestly make mince meat out of her assistants, and those assistance being every bit as self-conscious and docile to her demands, it is never as savage as it needs to be to show up the beauty obsessed world. Miranda Priestly is as delicious a villainess as you'd like her to be, but her actions don't portray the true shark that we know exists in that office. She's a one-dimensional cartoon first, and satirical allegory second. Take a film like Swimming For Sharks (1994) for instance  Kevin Spacey's movie boss is every bit as snarling and callous as Miranda, but with a vicious honesty that chokes out the niceties attached to The Devil Wears Prada. Whereas Mean Girls (2003) showed how a character can be sucked in to a world through vengeance, but end up just as nasty as her enemies, Andy is never truly swayed by everyone else's superficiality. At the start of the movie she doesn't define herself by her clothes, but half way through she turns into Kate Moss. She becomes obsessed with her work, and alienates her incredibly uninteresting boyfriend. She even flirts with other fashion designers, but then that's only human of her. Does she become a monster like some other critics have suggested? Not on your life. Her charming smile follows her right throughout Frankel's picture, never letting up despite the constant abuse thrown her way.<br/><br/>But whilst it may lack a bite or two, there's nothing terribly wrong with this film. It is consistently entertaining, if predictable at times, has some ripe old performances  Stanley Tucci steals every scene his in  and is generally a feel good couple of hours. Is the satire reminiscent of Wall Street (1987)? Certainly not. But if you liked Sex & The City, you'll love this. There is, however, a much darker film yet to be made about this subject."

","None of these is new  corporate warfare and ladder climbing, back-stabbing, masterful coups. What is perhaps a little unusual, at least to the lay audience, is the arena: the glossy, glamorous world of high fashion. Nor is it anything unusual that deep in the trenches are members of the gentler sex (an archaic reference?), as it has been decades since women are no strangers to power struggles at or close to the top, and indeed often come out victorious.<br/><br/>Such a one is Miranda Priestly (still using ex-husband's family name, with no consequence whatsoever), who helms the top fashion magazine ""Runway"". A terrifying tyrant who is deliberatedly soft spoken, she throw barbed satirical insults as fast as a machine gun can spill bullets, and concludes her one-sided conversation with her groveling underlings invariably with ""that's all"" (translation: get the hell out of my sight, you idiot). Meryl Streep needs no introduction, but those who have watched ""Prime"" (2005) and then this movie are reminded once again of the breadth and excellence she brings to the movie screen, every time without fail.<br/><br/>Playing opposite Streep is perhaps just as awe-inspiring as working for Miranda Priestly, and the lucky girl here is Anne Hathaway (""girl"" not used disrespectfully, but just to echo the term ""Miranda girl"" used in the movie), who just could be on her way to become eventually one of the successors of Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts, to be counted among the likes of Sandra Bullock, Kate Beckinsale and Reese Witherspoon. She plays the journalism grad Andy (for Andrea) Sachs who hopes that surviving as a glorified (job title: ""second assistant"") girl Friday for the fashion world goddess for a year will open doors everywhere.<br/><br/>The movie rests essentially on the relationship between the two. While the movie makers could build the whole thing on satire (I'm don't know if that's the route the original novel has taken), they eventually end up leaning towards the feel-good alternative. While Andy started out determined not to be bothered too much with all that high fashion ""stuff"", a spontaneous little speech this off-hand reference draws from Miranda earns from her respect for the latter's professionalism, which becomes a foundation of their relationship. On the other hand, her handling of the ""Harry Potter manuscript"" gives her one up on Miranda who is almost impossible to impress.<br/><br/>In the end, there is the old theme of losing yourself, and finding yourself again, somewhat melodramatic but unabashedly determined to be feel-good. There is a reasonable-sized supporting cast, from which two stand out. Emily Blunt capably portrays Emily, the ""first assistant"" who, with all her superiority complex over Andy, plays decently and fairly with her. (Even when at the first smell of a threat, when Andy is allowed a chance at the nightly task of delivering ""the book"" to Miranda's residence, Emily gives her all the correct instructions and cautious). The best however is Stanley Tucci, who never fails to add something wonderful to every movie he is in. In this one, he plays Nigel, who voluntarily acts as Andy's kind-hearted mentor and adviser, but ironically cannot protect himself from becoming casualty in the ruthless corporate arena.<br/><br/>""Prada"" is very much a cast driver movie and with Streep, Hathaway, Tucci and Blunt, it's a winner."

","First off, it has the classic ""small town, good hearted (and looking) working girl trying to make it in the greedy City"" plot, which is nothing new but a good frame. Anne Hathaway, as Andrea Sachs, does a good job as a recent journalism school grad taking a vicious gopher job for a the uber fashion Nazi of all times: Miranda Priestly! Andrea is unfashionable and doesn't even recognize that this miserable job, that fashion clones would kill for, means working for the Queen of that industry. Miranda Priestly is Meryl Streep to the nines and she plays it without any camp or ham. SHe was wonderful as the cold hearted ruthless King Lear, someone who berates poor Andrea Sachs for failing to book a Miami to NYC flight for her in the middle of a hurricane. Poor ANdrea puts up with her fascist nonsense and all the superficial fashion clones as a year of apprenticeship to the Devil herself. This will open doors for the kind of journalism that she really wants to do, she hopes.<br/><br/>Stanly Tucci plays Nigel, the kind of stereotypical career art layout man, devoted to Runway and Miranda, but with a heart of gold, in a totally forgettable part. Best in the support department, was Emily Blount, a newcomer, playing Emily, the devil's first apprentice. She is a towheaded English prig, who became a bitch by breaking her butt trying to satiate the Devil. She is miserable and calculating but you can't really hate her as she watches Andrea rise at her expense. One of the plot points revolve around the annual Paris fashion revue. Emily would normally go with the devil, she spent weeks dieting and learning French and the names of all the nabobs. But Emily gets a cold, and the germaphobic Devil discards her in favor of perky Andrea. Andrea feels really guilty taking Emily's place in Paris, which she didn't ask for and if the tables were turned, Emily would almost stab her a shot at Paris. Then there is the plot point where she alienates her scruffy boyfriend and clique as she turns into a ambitious fashion clone. Or success is spoiling her!<br/><br/>The biggest attraction is the glimpse of the fashion industry. Even someone like me who hates all that overpriced couture ""stuff"" and vacuous super model arrogance can find it interesting. It is an industry were superficiality and appearances are everything and good character and personality are an impediment. I admire the industry's ruthless approach to the new ""LOOK"". Here Streep's genius shines in her role as the chief ""Priest"" of this underworld. It isn't just sex that makes it attractive, it is their Venusian standard of beauty and style that makes it attractive to me. After all, all the sex appeal of the industry is there to sell to the women, not men like a Bud commercial. Hollywood might get superficial, but there are a lot of interesting souls like Woody Allen, Martin Scorcese, Jack Nicholson, Robert Altman or Winona Rider. But they wouldn't flourish to well in this industry; an industry where looking good is not only everything, but a 60 hour/week job too! But the movie is nothing too heavy and is quite suitable for teenagers, but that isn't bad because it is about something that one can't take too seriously."

","I really loved Meryl Streep in this, she was a perfect Miranda Priestley. I think I would have enjoyed the movie better had I seen it before reading the book. The movie stands fine alone as a comedy (in the ""9-5"" category of revenge movies), but I got more pleasure out of the book because of the more developed secondary characters. Lily was more interesting; the boyfriend a little more fleshed out. The movie didn't really have time to go into that. It was more of a slapstick comedy where the book was a little more cunning. I found it interesting that the character development in the movie was actually focused on Miranda instead. Not a terrible idea, but then it made it impossible for the movie to end the satisfying way the book ended. Anne Hathaway and Stanley Tucci were wonderful in this movie...I think Anne Hathaway is underrated as an actress, she's very believable and natural, Stanley Tucci's character is really sympathetic in this film.

Nancy Drew goes to New York and becomes a career girl in the fashion industry, has a fit of remorse (identity crisis?) because she's ""not being herself"" and snubbing her friends and being too ambitious.

The depiction of the cutthroat world of fashion, publishing and advertising was a real eye-opener and although disturbing in its negativity, educational just the same.

The Hathaway character and her development from frump to fashion conscious career woman, back to journalist with a conscience is unbelievable. First, though her outfits are awful at first, it is hard to believe that she is as fat and unattractive as she is made out to be. She's just a pretty girl in a bad sweater. Second, Meryl Streep's character is the one I came to like much more than Hathaway's character, the supposed hero, who abandons her boss in her hour of need. It was only her first job after college, not a career. The better course of action would have been to stick it out until the end of a year, then find another job.

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is cut from the same cloth as ""Sabrina"" and ""Funny Face,"" two beguiling Audrey Hepburn vehicles of the 50's in which America's most beloved gamine changes before our eyes from a wallflower to a swan. In due time, she falls in and out of love and samples the delights of the Big Apple and Paris. These movies succeeded where ""Prada"" fails, because they had a clear story line and point of view, although not a very emancipated one. At their most basic level, they're about Cinderella going to the ball and finding her prince. And, like ""Prada,"" they're about the happiness that money can buy you when you're dressed in haute couture; visually, they're valentines to the good life and the sophistication of the big city. <br/><br/>While ""Prada"" is descended from this tradition, its plot is straight off the Lifetime Channel: how do you have a personal life when you give your all to a job? What makes ""Prada"" problematic is that it sends mixed messages about the significance of that job--being a go-fer to the Queen Bee of Vogue--making it seem silly, then incredibly important and then worth chucking at the end for no reason at all. <br/><br/>Initially, the wide-eyed protagonist Andy Sachs (Ann Hathaway) sees her boss as Ivana the terrible and her co-workers as anorexic fashion victims. Then, in what is supposed to be a pivotal scene, Andy has an epiphany as her boss Miranda Priestley (Meryl Streep) points out in a long speech that the very color of the schlumpy sweater Andy is wearing was blessed by Priestley three years ago. The suggestion is that all along Andy,too, has been a fashion victim--just an unwitting one. <br/><br/>The problem with this analysis of the fashion food chain is that it's simply not true. There was a time when the fashion doyennes of New York could announce trends and make models' careers, but nowadays they're falling over themselves trying to get Gwyneth or Natalie or Julia on their covers. Fashion trends are as likely to start in the hood as they are on Seventh Avenue. No one waits with bated breath for Vogue to come out when readers can just as easily go online, see podcasts of the fashion shows and form their own opinions.<br/><br/>Women's magazines are, for the most part, playing catch-up rather than leading women like sheep. The ones that succeed do so by re-inventing the formula of a women's magazine: Lucky, for example, is indistinguishable from a catalog; InStyle is about crawling inside the closets and purses of Hollywood royalty; O is about the cult of personality and being Oprah's best friend. None of these magazines have dictatorial voices. If anyone is leading the pack, it's the goons in marketing research who are conducting focus groups to divine where the magazine ought to be ten years from now.<br/><br/>But that's more reality than this movie can handle. Afflicted with something resembling the Stockholm Syndrome, Andy sets out to be the best little go-fer in the whole world, which doesn't leave much time for a private life. Nigel the art director (Stanley Tucci) gives her a makeover and for the next third of the movie, Andy struts her stuff in finery pilfered from the closets of the magazine. For a movie that spends a lot of time fretting about business ethics and cutting corners on personal relationships, ""Prada"" has no problem accepting the practice of underpaid fashion magazine staffers appropriating swag that's actually the property of the magazine. Nor does it draw any connection between the monstrous salary that a Miranda Priestley draws and the abusive way she treats her underlings, or the propriety of treating magazine employees as personal servants who pick up her drycleaning.<br/><br/>In the oddest turn that the movie takes, Andy agonizes about hurting co-workers who have treated her abominably. That's supposed to be a sign of character rather than insanity. Andy is heartsick over going to Paris in place of Miranda's other assistant, Emily, who's a baby tyrant in training. When Andy learns that Miranda is likely to lose her job, she thinks only of Miranda's welfare and doesn't seem to realize that she's going to be on the street as well. She also passes up a chance to meet the editor of New York Magazine because it's her boyfriend's birthday--she's hours late for an intimate dinner with him, but can't spare an additional ten minutes for a meeting that could make her career. Ultimately, her way of resolving these conflicts is to throw her cellphone in the air--much like Mary Tyler Moore tossing her beret skyward--and leave to work in a ""serious"" environment--a small newspaper that's an amalgam of the Village Voice and the New York Observer. As if she won't find gargantuan egos and monstrous tyrants there.<br/><br/>Why has a movie with this many plot holes done more than a $100 million in box office receipts? Well, Streep is wonderful, the clothes are beautiful and Hathaway is charming. In the end, all this surface glitz seduces the audience just as it does Andy Sachs, but not without producing a gnawing feeling that we've been had. There's a place for a film about advancing your career without drawing blood or compromising your values until you no longer recognize yourself in the mirror. But ""The Devil Wears Prada"" need not have bothered. It exists merely to engage us on a visual level and indoctrinate another generation of young women on the glamour of a New York publishing career. Ironically, this is the very myth that the novel sought to explode."

","Can you say Oscar nominee? If you can, then Meryl Streep's performance in The Devil Wears Prada should be first on your lips and list. Her witty, cool, and wickedly abrasive character portrayal of Miranda Priestly in this film certain warrants at least that. <br/><br/>Simply put, The Devil Wears Prada is about corruption. Not political or business, but personal. The big question this movie asks is ""How much of yourself are you willing to let go of to get what you want? Or what you think you want?"" In this Summer's blockbuster comedy-drama, this question is not as easily answered as one might think.<br/><br/>Miranda Priestly has given up everything to become the president of Runway Magazine, the most expensive, most popular fashion periodical ever to hit the racks. To raise the magazine to such a prestigious level, Miranda has sacrificed everything  marriages, vacations, family. Her latest need, however, is fairly simple: a new office assistant. Enter Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway, HOODWINKED) a frumpy looking young lady who recently graduated from Northwestern University with a degree in journalism. Andy tries to use her position at Runway Magazine as a stepping stone to bigger and better jobs, but is soon sucked into the high-price, high-pressure world of fashion. She rapidly becomes Mrs. Priestly's direct assistant and has to be on-call 24/7. This wreaks havoc on her relationship with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier, ACROSS THE HALL) as she shows up late for dinners and even bypasses his birthday party. <br/><br/>A dawning awareness of what she's become (or might become) soon hits Andy and she's forced into making a decision that'll affect the rest of her life. Should she stay with Mrs. Priestly and become a wealthy design assistant with an ulcer? Or should she follow her original dream of becoming a journalist? In a set of excellent circumstances where Mrs. Priestly really needs her, Andy finally makes her decision. <br/><br/>It's a ""stand up and applaud"" moment for many viewers and even Meryl Streep's Miranda character seems pleased with Andy's choice ...right before she yells, ""Go!"" to her driver at the end of the film, indicating she may have approved of Andy's choice, but she's already made her own. <br/><br/>Anne Hathaway pulls in a ""beauty"" of a part as Andy Sachs. Mrs. Hathaway is a great looking lady (even when ""frumped"" up) but I'd be willing to bet she's never been a size six! She's so tiny! <br/><br/>But Meryl Streep's performance is simply amazing. Her bitchy, bossy, hardheaded, businesswoman performance was absolutely perfect! When she first meets Hathaway's character and says, ""You don't have any fashion sense.""

","Although I haven't read the book, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, in my opinion, is an excellent movie about the world of fashion. If you ask me, Miranda (Meryl Streep) and Emily (Emily Blunt) were absolute snobs! There is no way I'd work for someone like Miranda. As far as I could see, she treated Andy (Anne Hathaway) more like a slave than an employee. You'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. Also, if I had to work with someone like Emily, I don't think I'd get along very well. However, I loved the scenery in New York and Paris. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, the costumes were elegant, the production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent movie about the world of fashion. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it."

","So. I thought the movie was lots of fun (and omigod, the CLOTHES!) (and how fabulous was Meryl Streep!) (and Stanley Tucci is just absolutely my hero). I did thing Anne Hathaway was maybe a little bit too old to be playing a brand-new college graduate, but I can see how it would have been difficult to find an ingenue type of the appropriate age to play the role--I mean, can you see Lindsay Lohan pulling this off with any credibility? But I did have a tiny problem with the portrayal of the chef-boyfriend. And the scene when I saw the movie in Manhattan was something else--in a pretty fab way. I won't say more here for fear of spoiling, but check out my post on aliceinnewyorkland.blogspot.com--it's called ""Friday Night at the Movies (in which Our Heroine Contemplates Fashion and Jarlsberg)""."

","I'm not a fan of Anne Hathaway... not to say I am against her in anyway... she just never really ""did"" it for me. UNTIL NOW. First of all... she totally holds her own next to Meryl Streep. Who, lets all admit, can rock just about any role out there. I went for Streep.... and the clothes. Streep carries herself like never before. She is a power woman in this. Much like a man. She rules this world of excess and success. Another great acting surprise... Emily Blunt. Wow! fantastic comedic timing, that girl is a star. And put me in a theater with Stanly Tucci any day. He is amazing. Bravo. I loved it. And there are about ten thousand new bags and shoes I absolutely must have."

","Meryl Streep is outstanding, and Anne Hathaway is adorable. Mr Tucci is GREAT in this movie. The fashions are cutting edge, and impeccable in this movie. The storyline was like a bad fairy tale. I know of no one that would go into a job interview without combing their hair, wearing an ugly, wrinkled jacket, not knowing who their potential future boss is, and know nothing about the company that they would wish to work for- and expect to get the job because they claim to be a ""hard worker"". An ambititous man would be expected to work long hours, and be promoted based on their abilities. As the film progressed- I found the actions of Andy's friends to be immature, and unrealistic. Grasping a $1900 handbag from Andy, and then telling her that she has changed- in the same scene. What was the point of making Andy the victim of everyone's abuse in this movie? I know a lot of women who take care of the kids, and everything else too, while their husbands travel extensively for work- and that's OK- but this movie asks us to feel sorry for Andy's pathetic boyfriend because she missed his birthday party? ""Office politics"" exist everywhere, and the ONLY reason that I find this particular political story to be interesting is that the stars are good actors."

","Starbucks coffee on her desk before her (unscheduled) arrival. The latest fashions tailored to her liking. Such is the life of Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), fashion magazine editor. The Devil Wears Prada tells the darkly funny tale of her naive assistant, Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), who is drawn into the unforgiving world of modeling. Meryl Streep doesn't steal this movie, she IS this movie. Giving the first Oscar-worthy turn of 06, Streep, giving a riotous performance that stays in your head long after the rest of the movie evaporates from your memory. Hathaway gives a good, believable performance as the lead. Emily Blunt is hilarious and Adrian Grunier his scruffy self in supporting roles. I only wish the ending weren't wrapped in cookie-cutter clichés. Overall, an enjoyable break from the rush of the summer movie season. As Meryl Streep says, in her quietest, snarkiest, Priestliest voice; ""That is all."""

","Now, I will preface my review by stating:<br/><br/>1. I have never read the book nor will I ever 2. This was the only film currently in release that I could take my 65 year old mother to w/o offending her as well as boring me to death, so it was a compromise, not my first, second, or third choice.<br/><br/>What I did like was that Meryl Streep's character wasn't a screamer. That was about it. I was hoping the film would be more satirical and spoof what is superficial about the fashion industry. Instead it was almost a love letter to it. This didn't make sense to me; the characters who clearly live for fashion are absolutely miserable and appear to draw no pleasure from what they do. You hear stories of personal sacrifice from the characters to do what they love, but see little to no payoff in terms of personal satisfaction for them. I was waiting for the main character to simply ask, ""Why do you bother to put yourself through this?"" of anyone. I would have loved to have seen more of the politics of both the magazine and the industry and less of the so-called personal growth of the main character. It's nothing you haven't seen in an episode of Mary Tyler Moore.<br/><br/>At matinée prices, this is worth the 2 hours of air conditioning, if you bring your own snacks."

"Robert_duder","8","0","0","24 July 2006"," Sassy, stylish, a chick flick based on chick lit that SHINES!!
","Devil Wears Prada is the kind of film that the female demographic will LOVE!! Not to stereotype but it's full of fashion, sass, triumph, tragedy, tears and laughs. It's a feel good movie with a strong moral center and a movie character that will live on as classic...the devil herself. I have never been a Meryl Streep fan and in fact on numerous occasions have questioned why she is the most nominated Oscar actress but it's a cinch to see that is destined and deserving of her 14th Nomination playing The Devil (more on that later.) The film has a terrific story which I have never read the novel but I think it seems to capture the essence perfectly. While not exactly a laugh out loud comedy it's the type of film that makes you smile because you can relate to the characters and their situations. Everyone has had a tough boss and certainly Andy's is the pinnacle of that and watching Andy deal with her and overcome this situation and job and be the bigger person and learn about her life and desires.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway takes the lead in yet another adult role as she desperately struggles to make her mark as a serious non-Disney Actress. She'll do it and Devil Wears Prada is a huge step in the right direction, and one she doesn't have to whip out her boobs to prove herself. Even still it seems Hathaway is trying SO hard to prove herself and sometimes it shows so her performance suffers. She was so relate-able in Princess Diaries and her character needed to be relate-able to everyone in this film and she succeeds just not 100%. She gives it about a 75%. Still her character is strong, and outgoing and does everything she can to take on Streep. And on top of that Hathaway DOES hold her own against the amazing Streep. The down side to Hathaway's character is her rather questionable moral standards which fluctuate a great deal throughout the film sometimes making her seem less desirable but she does learn her lesson by the end which is good. Emily Blunt is terrific as well in a small role as Andy's co-worker ""Emily."" Emily is the typical girl you don't like. Stylish, skinny, and basically a bitch who must get won over by Hathaway's character which she does to an extent. Blunt is believable as a fashionista, and believable as Streep's assistant. Stanley Tucci is terrific in his role as Nigel, the rather direct and harsh fellow Fashion worker who very reluctantly befriends Hathaway. His role could have been bigger because he is great but nonetheless he does terrific. Adrian Grenier is Hathaway's boyfriend, already established in the film who gets pushed aside by Hathaway's ambition. You definitely feel sorry for the guy and he does well in this grown up role as a struggling 20 something chef who always gets shafted by his live in love. They don't really get a fair reunion in the end and I still felt like he could have done better after all she did. And finally...the performance of the film...The Devil herself Meryl Streep as the infamous Miranda Priestly. Priestly is just evil. She's cunning, cold blooded, completely emotionless, demanding, horrific, and yet the most respected woman in fashion and Editor and Chief of Runway magazine. Streep's performance is drop dead amazing, one of the best of the year. Her Devil is so not outwardly evil but has this slow, quiet, subtle way of worming her way into the viewers loving to hate her. She has terrific dialog and every line she speaks drips with disdain and serious conceit. The fact that Hathaway idolizes her in some ways is actually understandable because she is so powerful. Streep MUST get an Oscar nod for this role.<br/><br/>Hathaway and Streep's chemistry is remarkably terrific and yet Streep's character is never impressed, and never shows it despite the eventual mutual admiration. This whole film relies on and flourishes because of Streep's character and Andy's entire adventure working at Runway. Director David Frankel definitely carries over his Sex and The City experience to create a film definitely aimed at the female population and I'm sure it hits the mark. Much of the fashion humor was way over head (and fortunately I had my girlfriend there to explain it to me) and I must be insane but the numerous references to Anne Hathaway's weight MUST be fashion sarcasm to show the fickle and absurd opinions of the fashion industry. She is even referred to as ""not skinny"" on several occasions. Ummm yeah...not so much a good impression on young girls since Hathaway is skinny as a rail. The fashion in the film is very chique and definitely not the average person's fashion but the film is truly remarkable and a must see!! 8.5/10 (HUGE 9/10 for Streep's performance.)"

","This very well done movie should receive more credit than it probably will. Many times I've seen movies that show the world of fashion publishing, and frequently there is a key supporting male character who is probably gay and serves various script functions. Most of these characters are so terribly superficial (Andy Serkis in ""13 Going on 30"" comes to mind). But Tucci never takes the easy route in the character of Nigel, instead every line he delivers is layered with depth and soul, and his performance is one of the highlights of the film.<br/><br/>Wish I could say the same for Adrian Grenier's performance, which is flat and monochromatic. Ultimately his performance is what does the most damage in the film because we're supposed to be cheering for Andy to return to this character, and her friends, who she has supposedly treated badly, but you see no reason why she should have any loyalty to them at all. Unfortunate. In Mr. Greiner's defense, his performance has less to do with it than the writing of the character."

I think I went in expecting it to be very shallow, but it did have a point, and a good ending. Of course, Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway are both very very good in this movie, and wonderful in the previous roles I had seen them in, so it was really a very good movie. It's really about more than just shopping and brand names. You see the way certain characters live and wonder if you would be willing to live that way.

","There is great predictability in this movie but I didn't care. The plot was not really new...nor the moral of the story...but I didn't care. Because it was absolutely delightful. Meryl Streep delivered an Oscar winning performance as the horrible Miranda Priestly...gave her depth and reality and caused me to care very much about this isolated female character in the world that she made so extremely interesting. She made me love her and wish Andy didn't have to leave. I agree with brocksilvey..the world of Miranda and the people around Miranda were far more interesting than what she left behind. Anne Hathaway did better than a very good job, though I believe she had an awful lot to work with. Just standing there in front of Streep during the magnificent speech about Andy's cerulean blue sweater can give an actress a lot of credibility...just because she's there in the same air space. From the first moment of Streep on screen to the last second ""GO"" in the car...and all that beautiful acting in between she delivered a flawless performance. <br/><br/>I thought Emily Blunt was also superb. I looked forward to seeing her and missed her when she was gone. I am sure she actually cracked herself up when she said her ""not unless you have a bad skirt convention to go to"" and laughed. Loved that. She was great...can't wait to see her in something else. And Nigel (Stanley Tucci) was without doubt the strongest and overwhelmingly best male character...an actor who is never a disappointment..and who you never get to see enough of. <br/><br/>Because of the story matter I'm afraid a lot of people are going to assume this is a chick flick.

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a smart, amusing look at an industry that few take seriously yet one that affects almost everybody in some way.<br/><br/>I thought all the performers were up to the task, but the brilliant Meryl Streep as the demanding editor-in-chief of a Vogue-like fashion magazine creates a character that is absolutely unforgettable. Lesser actresses would have chewed up the scenery as a shouting, wild-eyed boss-from-hell; instead, Streep underplays it with a kind of resignation that no one can possibly meet her standards, that she is doomed to be surrounded by failure and incompetence.<br/><br/>In one marvelous scene in which the top editorial staff is planning the next issue of the magazine, Streep wearily dismisses all suggestions as uninspired or yesterday's news. But when the art director finally offers a truly original idea, there are no smiles or words of praise from Streep. She simply says, very coolly, ""I'm glad someone came to work today."" <br/><br/>You don't have to labor in the high-fashion world to relate to Meryl Streep's driven executive in this movie.

","Streep is brilliant and Hathaway is cute, cute, cute. Streep, a sadist of the ""good kind,"" dispenses her venom through a thousand tiny cuts and exercises her control through a thousand demands for trivial satisfactions, and the movie looks like this stuff is supposed to be somewhat addictive to Hathaway, drawing her close to Miranda. But, no, for me Streep and Hathaway seemed to be acting each in her own bubble, sealed off from any simple human contact with the other. Hathaway and Tucci however, seemed to me to connect in every one of their scenes. And Tucci and Streep connected similarly--lightly, easily. His helpless hurt and rage was buried so deeply one could catch only occasional glimpses of it, but I saw in him what Andi would be in time. So, to me Tucci provided conductance among the characters that, without his skill, might never have been felt."

","I thought this movie had it all. I can understand how this movie may not be a top ten for everyone, but I can guarantee that no matter your age or gender you will be NOT disappointed. <br/><br/>Why I gave it my highest movie rating thus far: 1) it was light hearted, the fun clothes and sarcastic comments had me and my girlfriend laughing out loud 2) it had it's serious moments -realizing your becoming distance from friends and family; realizing what you will and will not do to get ahead in life 3) as always I believe that people often rate movies the highest when the situations/characters are most relatable to themselves- therefore being a 20 something female trying to juggle work and relationship and friends and co-workers I identified with this movie completely. I understand how she felt first starting a job where no one gave her a hand, I understand how hard it is to submerge yourself into a new phase and yet keep your same characteristic. 4)Meryl Streep and Anne Hathway are wicked in this movie, their characters unbelievable realistic Yes the character Miranda is extreme but when you think about it how else do women in today's society get ahead? Most of the time they do have to be extra cold and workaholics to be taken as serious a man in the same position. <br/><br/>5) the thing I loved most about this movie is that it ended up surprising me in the end by not making this a ""she's really a softy underneath it all"" feel good movie. I thought for sure that in the end Miranda was going to realize what a bitch she had been all the years, then have an epithany and her and Andy were going to end up being best of friends drinking tea together. I absolutely loved the car scene when Miranda revealed that she had played ruthlessly to end up where she was ( and is that really a bad thing in this society? would it be more understandable if Miranda had been a man? business is business right?). After seeing the car scene I thought the title of the movie was highly highly appropriate and loved Meryl's Streep calm portrayal of such a realistically cold, evil and greedy person!<br/><br/>Great movie, go and see it!!!"

I went in excited because I thought I was going to see all of my favorite scenes translated to film but was disappointed because this wasn't the case. The whole ""Lily"" subplot is not there and that makes for one boring ending. While Lily does mention that she and Andy have been best friends for sixteen years, not much else is said. In the book, Lily is a college student studying Russian literature and she sleeps with random guys and has a drinking problem. In the movie, all we know about her is that she is Andy's best friend and she owns an art gallery. In the movie, Andy just leaves her job in Paris instead of the much more dramatic ending in the book where she goes to Lily who has been in an accident. Also, the character of Alex was totally cut out of the movie and instead her boyfriend is Nate. The only thing I liked about the movie was Meryl Streep's performance.

I was hoping in the scene when the twins told her to come upstairs and give the mock up copy to Meryl, that the twins were going to draw mustaches on the book and all kinds of other stuff. But the movie is just there and doesn't really produce a pure devil. Ending is good, story is lacking, but the videography is superb, fantastic, wonderful.

All in all, pitch perfect, with these three.<br/><br/>What I did not like was the facility with which Hathaway's friends dismissed her. Other than her improved make-up and fashion, and annoying habit of answering her cell phone at all hours, I didn't think she changed all that much after working for Miranda. I think she found her stride in an unexpected place, and her friends were just being selfish and myopic.<br/><br/>Streep managed to humanize the Miranda character, and I felt her final speech to Hathaway didn't necessarily justify a cell phone in the water gesture. I hear the book presents a more compelling moral dilemma. Here it just rang shallow. Miranda is not a beast, and I believe that Hathaway was learning from her.

Anne Hathaway was decent in a more mature role as Andrea, although it was a similar theme to the ""Princess Diaries"" - Ugly Duckling (More a fish out of water here) transformed through the mystical powers of the make-over. I liked that the film devoted just enough time to Andrea's character development that the contrast of the before and after was reflected not just externally, but internally as well.

I thought it was a good story line which moved swiftly. Meryl Streep is excellent as always and adds depth to the movie. Anne Hathaway seems to be a very good new talent and was enjoyable to watch. Another strength of the movie is its excellent location scenes; both in New York and Paris. It gives the movie additional breath. Much is made of the tyrannic character Meryl Streep plays in the reviews. Actually the movie includes showing a slight crack in the personality. Alas, the character lets slip a little humaneness. I would say she is typical though of the hard charging successful female type. Actually with Meryl playing the role, the viewer does not even get mad at her. Who could get mad at Meryl Streep ?

Anne Hathaway, in my opinion, was miscast as Andy Sachs, the hapless wannabe journalist who is hired to be an assistant to Streep's character, who is the editor of THE fashion magazine. I never bought that Hathaway had transformed into the kind of person she'd never wanted to be. She just seems like her sweet self throughout the entire movie, regardless of her change of wardrobe. Her so called transformation needed to be much more obvious in order for the film to truly work. The nasty assistant, Emily, played by Emily Blunt, nearly steals the show. And of course, Stanley Tucci is his usual brilliant self. His part of the story, unfortunately, is too marginal to make a difference. The group of young people who play Andy's friends are also not given enough of a role. The movie was fairly true to the book, which might be its main problem.

That said, I should have seen the movie first... then maybe I could have enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Streep and Hathaway gave amazing performances, but the movie simply did not compare to the book. I'm sure the movie is pretty good for those who have not yet read the book.<br/><br/>Bottom line: read the book (it's a REALLY enjoyable, can't-put-it-down read), but make sure you see the movie first so that you won't feel you wasted your $10."

","I came expecting the movie to at least bear some resemblance to the book - which I LOVED! The climactic scene from the book was something I looked forward to seeing on the screen. Alas, it was not to be. The movie moved SO fast, you couldn't tell what Andy was doing half the time. Nigel was a very minor character in the book - but he dominated the movie (and did so very well, I might add). Meryl Streep was fantastic as Miranda - but the glimpse of the ""human"" side of Miranda (when she tells Andy about her upcoming divorce through tears) didn't happen in the book and I felt it weakened her character. The character of Lilly was predominant in the book - and in the end, is partly responsible for Andy's epiphany of what she had become. Lilly was only seen briefly in the movie. And Alex (Nate in the movie) was like two different people. Even movie Andy weakens her character by sleeping with Christian (which she doesn't do in the book). I don't think the movie does justice to this wonderful novel. If I were Lauren Weisberger, I'd be upset."

","THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA <br/><br/>In one of THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA's most interesting moments, Lucifer herself Miranda Priestley (played like dry ice by Meryl Streep) discloses to her unknowing assistant Andy just how deeply layered fashion's influence on the world is. Whether others see it or not, Miranda knows that fashion determines everything. Even an article of clothing as hideous and offensive as Andy's Wal-Mart sweater was born from Miranda Priestley's knowledge of fashion. Everything from the most expensive Prada handbag to the cheapest department store purchase was born from Miranda Priestley's influence. In other words, fashion is more then just pretty clothes... it's art. Or at least that's how the boss from hell sees it in this high-style comedy directed by David Frankel.<br/><br/>THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA tells the story of Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway), a recent graduate with dreams of a being a real journalist in the big city. One morning, she finds herself interviewing for one of the most coveted positions in the fashion industry, an industry she knows nothing about. Andy interviews to be the second assistant for Miranda Priestley, Editor-In-Chief of ""Runway"" Magazine... and by some twist of fate she lands the job. Despite a lack of passion for fashion, Andy takes the job because after one year she'll have the only thing she currently lacks... power in her industry. However, life in this industry proves more jarring then Andy could have ever imagined.<br/><br/>It's ironic that, despite Miranda Priestley's eloquently stated belief in the importance of fashion, the film that depicts that industry is nothing but a fun and expensive display of pretty clothes. Granted, the clothes and styles on screen in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA are incredibly beautiful, and this is sure to please the fashion conscious world that will make up most of the films audience. However, for someone like me, it would have been nice to have a director take the reigns in a Miranda Priestly style. By refusing to accept anything that is mere fluff, and demanding depth and precision at every turn, this film could have really soared. Sadly, the aforementioned scene in which Miranda lectures Andy on fashion was the only moment in this film where I felt the movie had a distinct voice.<br/><br/>Aside from that moment, I left THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA thinking ""Yes, it was fun... but what was the point?"" The film has been heavily promoted as a comedy, yet I didn't find myself laughing. On top of that, I never cared about a single character more then I would in a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. So why did I still find THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA to be a decent film? I think the appeal lies in that carnal curiosity everyone has since grade school. The desire to see what it's like to be the most popular kid in the room... even though every ounce of common sense tells you the popular kids are not worth your time. Miranda Priestley represents the cruelest of the cool kids, as she flaunts her power and money in the cruelest way. Her life is one people yearn for even while she cuts them down with an evil glare for simply breathing in her air. This living devil of a woman is captured brilliantly in a magnetic performance from Meryl Streep. Much fuss has been made over this being Meryl's best ""comedic"" performance ever... I disagree. As a matter of fact, I didn't find anything funny in the entire movie. Nonetheless, the performance is fascinating to watch. What a pleasure to watch a performance so lived in given by such a great actress. Every fiber of her being wreaks of evil.<br/><br/>Aside from Meryl Streep, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA does feature an enjoyable performance from Anne Hathaway and some killer clothes... but not much more. The story is formulaic, and every twist and turn is cliché. It's just decorated a little more expensively then your average romantic comedy. As I think back on how well Streep was able to convey the importance of fashion in one scene, it becomes clearer why this movie disappointments. If you take away the fancy clothes and Streep's performance, this movie feels as familiar and ordinary as the Wal-Mart sweaters that ""Runway"" magazine looks upon with unabashed disgust.<br/><br/>...

","To the vast number of people of the world, what is called ""high fashion"" is nothing more than a trivial pursuit for the very rich and very gullible. It is an industry devoted to spending huge sums of money to create exotic, often hideous, clothing that few can afford and even fewer can actually wear. But according to various characters in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, fashion isn't so much of an industry as it is an art form. And not just the design and the creation of the clothing itself, but its presentation in word and image, as well as its promotion as a means of shaping and advancing a culture. Like some sort of stylistic Reaganomics, the god-awful million-dollar gowns and garments being pasted onto stick-figure models on the runways of Paris and Milan today may someday, eventually, have some effect on what average Americans will happily buy off the clearance rack at Wal-mart.<br/><br/>Maybe. Maybe not.<br/><br/>But THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA does seem to suggest two things with reasonable confidence. One, the people involved in the fashion industry do totally believe that what they do is important and that minor details such as the hue of a blouse or the hem line of a skirt has meaningful consequences. And two, those who control the industry are so rarefied and isolated from reality that they can't comprehend just how meaningless those consequences really are.<br/><br/>The backdrop for PRADA is Runway magazine, a Vogue-like industry bible ruled with cold-blooded self-assurance by editor Miranda Priestly (brilliantly played with self-assured cold-bloodedness by Meryl Streep). The goal of the magazine it would seem is to visually strive for female perfection and if that isn't enough the magazine also prides itself on featuring the works of celebrated writers and photographers. Curiously, when a magazine such as Playboy defends its existence, it will be in defense of the search for female perfection, with the works of celebrated writers and photographers tossed in for good measure. Clothed or unclothed, do we seem to have competing styles of pornography at play? Who is objectifying women more? At least Playboy is thrifty enough to forego the cost of expensive wardrobes.<br/><br/>To some extent, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is a remake (a designer knockoff?) of the 1957 musical FUNNY FACE, wherein bookworm Audrey Hepburn finds herself transformed into a butterfly by almost accidentally being seduced into the superficial world of high fashion by photographer Fred Astaire. This time around it's Anne Hathaway; she plays a wannabe journalist who rather unbelievably finds herself to be the second assistant to Streep's maven of style. Arguably, PRADA could have been about any business, since the focus of the story is on dehumanizing corporate ethics, the downsizing of personal integrity and other issues dealt with previously in films from EXECUTIVE SUITE and THE APARTMENT to NETWORK and SWIMMING WITH SHARKS. But by placing PRADA in a world primarily ran by and catering to women (and a few gay men), the film challenges the naive notion that women would do it all so much differently if they were in power. And tellingly, for a film about fashion, it offers precious few glimpses of style, beauty or elegance, the very elements with which the characters justify their existence. Hard edged and icy, PRADA has more in common with David Mamet's brutal GLENGARRY GLEN ROSS than with the joyous glamour of Stanley Donen's FUNNY FACE; no one so much as hums a Gershwin tune.<br/><br/>PRADA's focus is on Hathaway, who as the lamb among the wolves learns the value of being a sheep in wolf's clothing -- though admittedly, the wolves dress quite well. But just as Priestly sets the style and the tone of the fashion world, that job falls to Streep in the movie. Streep manages to be coolly hilarious and coldly horrifying, creating a career-woman monster that falls somewhere between Martha Stewart and Cruella De Vil -- not that that is such a wide gap. A part that could have been played quite successfully as broad comedy (think Sigourney Weaver in WORKING GIRL), instead is granted surprising depth by Streep, even though she barely changes facial expressions throughout. When the character so much as flirts with being sympathetic or vulnerable, Streep summarily discards such emotions as if they were particularly unflattering rhinestone accessories. Unlike this season's collection, her performance will be a perennial favorite, one not likely to soon go out of fashion."

","Excellent! Meryl Streep as the consummate b---- and Anne Hathaway is beguiling as ever. Loved, just loved this movie! Oh, and the clothes aren't bad, either! ;-P As someone who's knowledge of the fashion world is pretty much limited to a few reality shows on cable TV, I was afraid that some of the humor in the film would be lost on me. But not to fear! This film makes the industry accessible to all viewers so that they can join in on making fun of it, in a good-natured, but we really do secretly love it sort of way.<br/><br/>In the end, the plot is really pretty straightforward. It really all comes down to a ""finding oneself"" story with a great witchy boss thrown in. BUT, Streep's performance as that boss especially is not to be missed. Oh, and then there are the clothes.

We've been watching her thirty years, and yet she still surprises, still pulls this rabbit out of her sleeve. I'm in awe.<br/><br/>""Devil Wears Prada,"" is, of course, based on Lauren Weisberger's book of the same title. The book is a thinly veiled ""roman a clef"" that depicts Weisberger's stint as assistant to Anna Wintour, editor of Vogue. The book was trashed by New York critics, because it skewered a powerful member of their own clique.<br/><br/>Ironically, Merly Streep's wicked performance as an amoral, conniving, cut-throat editor is the reason to see ""Devil"" -- and, believe me, it's reason enough. I had more fun at this movie than at ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" The rest of the movie is weak. Anne Hathaway, as ""Andy,"" the assistant, is very beautiful, but the script gives her little to do. She is a satellite revolving around Miranda / Streep. The script never explains why Andy is so eager to please Miranda, and so loyal to her. At a key moment, Andy breaks off a new relationship and rushes to ""save"" Miranda. Why? The script never explains. This is a shame, because Andy comes very close to selling her soul to her ""devil,"" and that could have made for some interesting dialogue.<br/><br/>Andy's tight-knit group of friends are a complete wash-out, and that is a terrible shame. The failure to animate this crew will keep this movie from becoming a classic in the category of ""All About Eve."" The filmmakers seemed to want to make Andy's friends a squadron of political correctness: her boyfriend looks Hispanic, she has a friend who may be gay, and her girlfriend is black. This would have worked if these people were believable as friends, if there were any chemistry at all between them, but there is none. The boyfriend is especially weak. He displays as much emotional involvement as if he had walked in from a fast-food commercial being filmed in the studio next door.<br/><br/>But don't let that stop you. You've gotta see Streep. She's the very best devil this summer. And she pulls it all off with no special effects, other than her own wonderful talent."

The movie had everything going for it, a great story revolving around the fashion industry and the lengths people are willing to go to fit in, look fabulous, even if that means not eating. I hope that the movie spoke important volumes to people that feel they need to be a certain size. I love the contrast of a Woman being in charge VS. a Man. It was an important message to some people out there that live their whole lives centering on their career and realize the more important things they're missing out on. The acting was top-notch and Meryl Streep, well I'm never disappointed by her work, she's a genius. Anne Hathaway was refreshingly grown up and this was a big step up from ""The Princess Diaries"" franchise. Great to see her in such an adult role, which she does with great confidence. The direction was excellent and the visuals were amazing. I love the cinematography surrounding the beautiful locations. The soundtrack was FANTASTIC. Two Madonna songs was extra icing on top the cake. ""Jump"" and ""Vogue"" were two perfect choices. I love this movie and was impressed that they left the funniest parts out of the trailer.

After so many movies with ""dick jokes"" (Click) ""bathroom humor"" (Click)and ""vulgarity"" (any Martin Lawrence movie), it is nice to see subtle, graceful humor, delivered by a master! The supporting cast wins in their efforts also. The film captured the philosophy, politics and strategies of corporate America and the fashion industry. TDWP shows that the reality of life forces us to make choices that don't always please those around us. The only point that I would make different is that sometimes it is OK to move on from old relationships that have past the ""expiration date"". Sometimes change involves letting go and moving on. This isn't an indication that the person is morally wrong or has a character flaw. Life changes, people grow and new horizons are to be explored with new friends. Letting go is a part of moving forward."

The language looked like the novel was written by Walt Disney or Geroge Lucas and that is not honest.<br/><br/>It was disappointing to see some of the peripheral characters reduced even more. While Hathaway did a fantastic job, given her past two dimensional stilted work from Disney, I still do not find Streep as great a legend everyone makes her out to be, though she was indeed satisfactory.

Kudoes to her makeup artist/hairstylist. Manhattan and Paris were artistically captured on film and both cities rang true and palpable. The tempo was upbeat and absorbing and the musical score added a bright dimension to the action. Prada never flagged and it was edited with a keen eye and discernment of fluid continuity.

","Minor thematic and plot spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>First and foremost, get it out of your heads that this is movie is tailor-made only for women. The themes this movie explores are much more universal than anything you'd find in a women's-only movie. Secondly, the actors' personalities help to mitigate any romantic sap this movie has. There's romance, but it takes a backseat to the hustle-and-bustle world of the fashion magazine industry. Meryl Streep gives a fine performance as Miranda, playing it quiet as opposed to over-the-top. She's the perfect ""ice queen,"" cool and silent yet sharp and biting. Sure, the character is exaggerated, but Miranda is a great example of someone driven for success at all costs. She is actually quite a sympathetic character towards the end. The lovely Anne Hathaway is also great as Miranda's protégé, who is willing to do the Labors of Hercules to succeed in her new career. Stanley Tucci is great as Miranda's fashion-savvy and snide assistant.<br/><br/>Men and women alike will relate to both Streep and Hathaway's characters, and understand the onerous business of working one's way up in the world. It's a very universal theme, and it works in this movie's favor. While not really a ""chick flick,"" I will give the movie this: the main female characters are complex and engaging, while the men, with the exception of Tucci, are weenies. In spite of the rather negative portrayal of the men, it is very unfair to call this decent film---one of the best of the year so far---a simplistic ""chick flick."" <br/><br/>A scene to watch for is when Miranda explains to Hathaway the subtleties of color in fashion, and how Hathaway chose her ""blue"" dress only through the tortuous promotion of fashion magazines and designers. It is a lovely example of a businesswoman indoctrinating her her naive protégé into her complex world. While the film was not great, I think Streep should at least get an Oscar nomination for her subdued performance, ""that's all!"""

","My husband was more than a little unenthused with my choice of movies for our first night out in a while. He assumed we were in for a typical chick flick, bubbling with clever banter, artsy characters, complicated romances, etc.,.... and he was right. BUT with its deliciously despicable Miranda Priestly, balanced by an impossibly upbeat heroine in Andrea, and an ending as perfectly satisfying as you could want -- HE enjoyed it as much as I did. Yes, it was a little predictable but who cares? Sometimes you need the outcome you expect. And I disagree with an earlier reviewer who felt this movie characterizes New Yorkers as ""so wired they can't even go to the restroom because their desks must be occupied at all times"". I mean, if everyone had to sell their souls (and sacrifice their bladders) to keep their jobs, what would be so uniquely challenging or movie plot-worthy about working for Miranda? And that's what we both loved about this movie. It painted a vivid (if cartoonish) picture of an unrepentant, outrageously demanding, ruthlessly calculating boss and the gradual character descent of her smart, capable, well-intentioned assistant. Although Andrea entered the fray with a bemused, above-it-all perspective, she was gradually sucked into the endless and fruitless pursuit of trying to please, at all costs, the unpleasable Miranda. So what if Miranda's character is a little over the top? I've worked for one of those crazies myself -- and some who haven't had the privilege might be shocked to know how outrageously unreasonable they CAN be. If you've ever likewise had this hair-pulling, head-pounding, character-building experience you'll find this a vicariously satisfying romp on a whole different level. Ah, but Miranda's not the only one who gets her just desserts in the end (sort of). Anyone who's ever been thrown under the bus by a groveling, self-promoting, hiney-kissing co-worker whose every breath edifies and encourages the outrageous antics of an ego-maniacal bully/boss... well, just go see this picture.

","Not sure if Devil is a comedy or a drama. I call it a drama but my friends say this film is definitely a comedy. Whatever the genre, this is a must see for anyone who appreciates great acting. Yes, this year's award for making a mediocre story into a truly great cinematic escape goes to Meryl Streep. Her Miranda is cold and calculating (don't expect a crazed, fanatical, over- the-top character - hers is more reserved, intense). What Streep does (she makes it look effortless though this performance can only come about through hard, disciplined work) is art in the highest form. Miranda is one of the most original ""bad guys"" created on film. We hang on her every word. We see her struggle for power and self-preservation. And we don't want to forgive her, but we do. These are not the type of emotions audiences usually feel towards the antagonist but Streep gives us a real person, not a caricature. And this is what propels the film along (this and some of the best night shots of New York I've seen). Kudos to the director, cinematographer, script writer (some great and memorable lines), and to whoever got Streep to sign on to this film."
"emswife-1","8","0","0","3 July 2006"," Hmmm... how did this become a ""broad comedy""?
","We just got back from viewing this film, and at the risk of sounding ""punnish"", here is a snapshot of my take on this flick.<br/><br/>While this is not supposed to be a ""chick flick"" but an adult alternative to Superman Returns for the box office buck, I sure felt lonely in the half packed auditorium. I could count the number of other males in the audience on one hand... and I didn't have to use my thumb.<br/><br/>This is a very witty, charming but retold ""coming of age"" story. You know, naive girl comes to NYC (with a boyfriend already attached that is never explained), gets job with hoity-toity ""dragon lady"" boss, loses her ideals in the glamour, comes to her senses and wins back her morals (and her soul... but not quite everything. You'll see what I mean). I don't consider this a spoiler so much as a plot summary of what we have seen in lots of other flicks and the John Cusack/Kate Beckinsale movie ""Serendipity"" comes to mind. But what ""Serendipity"" lacked was Meryl Streep as a villain... but with a heart of pure ice.<br/><br/>Streep takes a great turn for the runway with this flick. She has rarely been this acerbic, able with a oneliner and so vulnerable all at the same time. And having spent several years building sets, hanging lights and hauling around equipment while prima donna models treat you as largely invisible, I can attest that this movie has all the right (yes, another pun coming...) moves. The girls are snobby, thin and lacking in self esteem, the main designer is played by Stanley Tucci to a ""t"" and and the plot's one main twist is not really apparent until it is sprung.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie. I can only hope to see ""A Prairie Home Companion"" while ""Prada"" is fresh in my mind. I want to see if Streep really is in her ""salad days"" and ensuring her place in Hollywood history as the most versatile actress since the ""Golden Age"" of Bette Davis, Anne Bancroft, Barbara Stanwyck and the other great actresses of the screen. I think she is already 90% there and ""Prada"" only serves to provide more fuel for that greatness fire.<br/><br/>By the way, I hope that we see much more of Anne Hathaway than we have of Kate Beckinsale... and I don't mean skin since she has already done that in ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""Havoc"". I just hope she doesn't become another pretty face lost in the blecch called the Hollywood of Kirsten Dunst, Jessica Simpson, Kate Bosworth and all the bleach blonde ""flavors of the day"". She has a great look and a great presence. I hope someone finds the right, next great script for her."

","You know the story by now, ""good"" girl gets sucked into the fashion-world; almost sells her soul but in the end, virtue triumphs. GREAT performance by Ms. Streep (does she ever give less than?) and Hathaway is believable in the young ingénue role. Tucci is fine; others are adequate but don't add much. The clothes aren't as great as ""Sex in the City"" but were styled by the same Patricia Fields. This movie would also be good for young girls, as it would (hopefully) make them realize that external beauty isn't all it's cracked up to be (or is it since the stars of the movie are all easy on the eyes).

Meryl Streep, wonderfully bitchy as the editor-in-chief of a major fashion magazine, delights in tormenting her assistants with impossible requests, but even Streep can't save this soap opera. The plot is obvious from the moment Streep hires Hathaway, the ""fat, smart girl,"" as her second assistant. (If Hathway is fat, there is no hope for the rest of us.) Every character, from Hathaway's naive ingenue to the gay fashion director, catty first assistant, shallow ""hero"" writer, and college boyfriend, has stepped straight out of Screen writing 101.

A very believable story and although Hathaway plays with authenticity (how can anyone have such big, beautiful eyes?!), Streep steals the show with another excellent performance. Try as you might as a viewer to dislike this woman, Streep never quite lets you get away with it that easily. There is a constant undercurrent that although she needs to be professionally ruthless to be successful, there lurks a vulnerable woman underneath. Toward the end, that vulnerability is seen, to shocked gasps from the audience. The pace was brisk and once or twice I laughed out loud, which is unusual for me. A fine movie, well made, and artistically shot - Paris was photographed perfectly."

","I read every issue of ""Vogue,"" ""Elle,"" et al as soon as they hit the newsstand. When the book ""The Devil Wears Prada"" came out a few years ago, I was anxious to find out what goes on behind the scenes at my beloved glossies. I found the book tedious and pointless. I put it aside half read and ended up selling it to a used book store for a few bucks. <br/><br/>I was interested in the movie because I could get the same story and see the sumptuous couture in the movie and while only sacrificing two hours of my time. I did enjoy the movie. There are some laughs to be had, and unlike most movies these days, this one doesn't stoop to toilet humor<br/><br/>I thought Anne Hathaway is adequate as our heroine, Andie. Hathaway's wide- eyed look suits the character of the corn-fed midwestern college graduate well. During the movie, several character refer to Andie's intelligence. I just don't quite the light of intelligence in her eyes or the ambition to pursue a career in journalism that would be required to withstand the constant stream of abuse to which she is subjected. She merely seems like a nice young woman who has a mean boss.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep, on the other hand, absolutely possesses the imperious couture- clad character of Miranda Priestly. She walks the fine line of cartoon dragon lady and brittle flesh and bone woman with the expertise of a tight rope walker. She's hissably hateful without ever losing touch with the character humanity. Earlier in the day I saw Streep in ""Out of Africa,"" and I was astounded that the same actor could have played both characters. <br/><br/>Stanley Tucci also deserves strong props for his role as Nigel, Runway magazine's stylist. He's long-suffering without being weary and and he carries on his job in as professional manner as Miranda with none of her cruelty.<br/><br/>The movie was styled by Patricia Fields, best known for her work with ""Sex and the City,"" and I could see more than a little of Carrie Bradshaw in the gorgeous costumes. It was nice to see what the SATC characters might be wearing a few years after the show left us."
"eastbergholt2002","8","0","0","3 July 2006"," Hollywood Morality
","The Devil Wears Prada is an enjoyable movie about a New York fashion magazine called Runway. It's a good movie spoiled by Hollywood's assumption that successful women like Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep)sell part of their soul to achieve success. It implies that good girls like Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) should stick to traditional, wallflower roles if they want to be happy. <br/><br/>Miranda is a famous editor and a perfectionist with a genius for fashion whose judgment is respected throughout the industry. Miranda is tough and ruthless and can be brutal with her subordinates. Andy is a recent graduate from Northwestern who is looking for a job in journalism. She turns up at Runway in all the wrong clothes and is on the receiving end of some bitchy but funny diatribes. Andy is smart and slowly becomes indispensable to Miranda. Hathaway already looks like a model so the transformation from frump to fashionista doesn't take very long.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep avoids caricature and gives a brilliant and subtle portrayal. Miranda has paid a price for her fame and success, she is trying to bring up two daughters and has had a succession of jealous husbands. She loves her job and fights her corner. Stanley Tucci is excellent as Miranda's effeminate second in command and Emily Blunt is very good as the PA. Hathaway is convinvincing as Andy. <br/><br/>The plot is derailed slightly by Andy's moral dilemma. Andy is a nice girl repelled by Miranda's Machiavellian manipulations. Andy's boyfriend (Nate) is a chef who doesn't seem to work in the evenings. He complains about Andy's new work habits and fails to give her any support. As a Brit, it's well known that most top London chefs are highly strung, prima donnas who torture incompetent subordinates. Paying your dues in the kitchens of Gordon Ramsay or Marco Pierre White can make a career. Nate doesn't seem to get that working for Miranda can help Andy's career. You sympathise with successful women coping with insecure boyfriends. Miranda probably has it right when she says that everyone wants to be like her."

We might have had little or no personal or family life, but we loved our work and thought it was ""more fun than fun."" We just didn't get the designer clothes and shoes as a perk. But we can enjoy the clothes and shoes in this fabulous hour and a half fashion show. And enjoy Australian actor Simon Baker. Meryl Streep is at her finest and will surely get an Oscar nomination for her role as the very successful career woman you have to admire but hate to love.

To be smart and elegant turns out to be more than airheaded and snooty. There are good-hearted souls even in the world of fashion (well, at least in the movies), and there's much to admire in their tough competitive ethic and leadership abilities, and we get some honestly compelling arguments for the importance of the art and the industry.<br/><br/>This is a beautifully made film with a sharp script and some very classy performances--from Streep, Hathaway, Blunt, Tucci, and Baker.<br/><br/>My complaint about the handling of Miranda's twist on the double cross is that she takes too long explaining herself. She confronts Irv with a list of top photographers and models who will stay loyal to her no matter what. C'mon, is THAT plausible?

The rest of characters are portrayed by talented actors which entangle in this story showing the painful struggle to make it to the top and stay there. It's a portray of the trade in that everyone has to go through in life to reach fame, an enviable position, or sometimes a simple job in a competitive market. Very cruel most times.<br/><br/>The photography is as spectacular, mostly the one in Paris; but the movie feels to be too large at times.

Anne Hathaway is perfect for the role of Andy because she knows how to be awkward and mousy but then turn into a real princess. Meryl Streep could not have been more well-suited for this role. I think she may have been born to fill those gorgeous Manolo Blahniks! Stanley Tucci was absolutely wonderful in his role. He played the ""I don't care (but I really do)"" role quite well and excelled at playing the prissy prince of Runway. Adrian Grenier did a good job at keeping us grounded to Andy's former self, but with such a small part, his options were limited.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is fun with quite a few fashion quips and well worth the money to see it.

","This is a delightful piece of froth; actually it's froth with a bite. The fashion-clueless journalism major gets a job as an assistant to the irascible editor of the world's foremost fashion mag, and finds she must make some tricky ethical decisions--tricky in the sense that there are no obvious right or wrong answers--and she never has much leisure in which to weigh her options. She can't even depend on her friends for advice because they have their own agenda: stop working so hard and spend more time with us.<br/><br/>The shining star in this tale is of course Meryl Streep as the high priestess of the fashion world, Miranda Priestly; her flawless comic timing and wonderful facial expressions had the theater audience chuckling most of the evening. Anne Hathaway turned in a nice acting performance as Andy, the sometimes dowdy, sometimes radiantly beautiful young assistant. Stanley Tucci's putdowns were so nasty they were funny; his role as the artistic director Nigel was a masterpiece in eccentricity. And Emily Blunt gave a fine performance, too, as Andy's reluctant and arrogant mentor.<br/><br/>Certainly worth a mention were the wonderful shots of New York City, especially the night views; one side view from deep in the interior was breathtaking (must have been computer enhanced), and a later birdseye view also was nice.

Hathaway went too quickly into the couturier mode; she should have taken more time and there should have been many more outfits. After all, that is what all these women dragged their guys into.

","Did the makers of this candy-coated confection actually think they were saying something wicked or insightful about the fashion industry?

It's like a Ross Hunter or Doris Day sex comedy from the early 1960s, or ""That Girl,"" with the honest young thing conquering New York and staking out a fabulous wardrobe without ever falling for the lies and false values of the high-fashion milieu (though the movie certainly ogles that world enough). Yes, we love Meryl Streep's way with a line -- as an Anna Wintour-like gorgon, sort of an update of Kay Thompson's turn in ""Funny Face,"" she purrs her insults with brilliant underplaying, like a latter-day George Sanders. And we love Stanley Tucci, as a flamboyant, frustrating, but invariably right veteran of Seventh Avenue (we've all worked with somebody like this). We don't even mind Anne Hathaway, though we've seen this character before in literally hundreds of movies. But the utter predictability is a big letdown, as is an otherwise colorless supporting cast saying witless things on Manhattan and Paris streets. And the movie feels ambivalent about the industry: It ridicules the high-pressure environment yet also kind of admires it. Meryl has a big scene tearing down Anne Hathaway's fashion sensibility that the movie actually seems to side with. I find it infuriating that anybody would care this much about the nonsense of what next season's big fashion will be, but if they're going to put this world on screen, they should have its denizens say and do more interesting things. As it is, the only real suspense is what outfit Anne Hathaway will show up in in the next scene."

"lotekguy-1","6","3","8","30 June 2006"," Meandering comedy falls short on the satire and the coming-of-age side
","This one plays out as glitzy attempt at one of Garry Marshall's contemporary Cinderella comedies. He struck gold with Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman, and PG'ed the hooker into a teenager when he cast another leggy ingénue with an engagingly over-sized smile, Anne Hathaway, in The Princess Diaries. In this adaptation of a popular novel, Hathaway stars as a bright, earnest journalism grad, yearning for her first job in Manhattan. The first big interview opportunity she gets is to become a personal assistant to the most influential (and absurdly demanding) magazine editor in the world of high fashion, underplayed flawlessly by Meryl Streep. Our girl looks like a librarian from the Midwest, and couldn't be more of a misfit among the obsessively skinny feminists, but Meryl apparently sees something under that drab surface, and hires her, anyway.<br/><br/>For nearly two hours we see Anne's aspirations and ties to her boyfriend and old circle of pals wax and wane as they clash with her new role. Of course she starts dressing the part, with the assistance of a relatively non-snotty honcho (Stanley Tucci), who furthers the Marshall model by filling Hector Elizondo's kindly-mentor shoes. Somewhere between the fantasy of glamor and the lack of time to form her own thoughts, since she's at the mercy of Meryl's every whim on a 24/7 basis, her outer and inner beauty start heading in opposite directions. Will this job remain as her tone-year, resume-building stepping stone to writing about serious social issues, or will she be seduced by the perks of hobnobbing with the rich and famous, including the romantic interest of a successful writer (Simon Baker) who may be more suited to the evolving edition of Anne's personality? Beyond the obvious eye-candy feast inherent in this setting, the script serves up some good laughs and effective sentimental moments, though not enough for nearly two hours. Had the story been lightened and tightened into a breezy industry satire with a dollop of romantic intrigue, they wouldda been a contender. But the attempt at depth (presumably more true to the novel) requires more distance from reality than usual. Getting Julia off the streets, and seeing a gawky mid-teen Anne grow into her birthright (including a much-needed sense of self-esteem) were more intrinsically desirable than watching a bright young woman of conscience drink the Kool-Aid Streep is pouring.<br/><br/>Early in the going, Meryl rebuts Anne's disdain for everything they stand for with a sharp diatribe about the value and pervasive influence of the designers she makes or breaks, even on those who don't realize it. For a while, that speech seems to validate their existence more than expected. It certainly causes Anne's character to shift her thinking. For anyone who doesn't rely on Cosmo and its ilk as essential reference material, the only reason those lines work is that Meryl Streep is saying them.<br/><br/>In what kind of Bizarro world should a woman as slender and wholesomely pretty as Hathaway at the beginning be derided as too fat and frumpy? Who believes it's even possible, much less admirable, to float above all the cares and problems the rest of us live with in an endless quest for the smallest size of whatever some distant strangers decide is chic? Beauty in troubled times gives relief and hope...to a point. The Devil of this title isn't Streep's overbearing manner; it's the temptation of form over substance, mirrored by the film's ultimate lack of substance worthy of its stars. Looks great; less filling."

Naïve about fashion and seeing this all as just a filler job, Andy finds herself seconding Emily as the assistant of Runway's editor-in-chief, the fearsome Miranda Priestly. While Andy tries to take it all in her stride, she sound finds herself forced to buy into the world she now works and also running to keep up with the unreasonable and regular demands of her new boss.<br/><br/>My girlfriend now has Sky+ and, despite the fact that she could tape anything and hold it on the drive to watch when she is home, she never does and the question still gets asked ""what's on?"" to the answer ""nothing"". So in an attempt to have a library to dip into, I recorded a handful of films  one of them being this film. Otherwise I probably wouldn't have bothered with it, since I never did in the cinema or on video. Watching it I found it to be quite enjoyable in the same way as I had done with Ugly Betty when I could be bothered to watch that. What I mean by this is that the b1chy world of the fashion magazine is well captured and fun to view from the outside. Outside of this though, the film is not that strong particularly where it has to try and come up with some sort of plot to give the film somewhere to go.<br/><br/>In this regard it does rather fall down as I cannot imagine anyone is surprise to see that Andy changes, hurts those closest to her and ultimately has to re-examine herself and what is important to her. It does exactly this and it offers nothing to surprise or challenge along the way. Fortunately the world of Runaway is amusing enough to carry the film and here is where Streep carries it along. Her performance isn't the most complex of course but it s wonderfully done nonetheless, making a strong central character. Hathaway is OK and does enough to act as the fresh eyes of the viewer in this world. Blunt is a bit too stiff but I suppose this is more her character than her performance. Tucci is enjoyable but I found Baker and Grenier to be creepy and wet respectively.<br/><br/>Overall then a short summary of the fashion world that will save you watching the lacklustre Ugly Betty to get much the same. The plotting is weak and as a result the film can only be so enjoyable but the b1tchiness makes it an amusing distraction."

","We all know those movies.<br/><br/>You know the ones. Ugly duckling with huge glasses and pony tail ends up prom queen, boy's sick horse gets better against all odds and wins the race, young poor girl dreams of being an actress and finally joins the army to kill some alien bugs. As kids we all loved those, because everything turned out great in the end and all the wishes came true (except the alien bugs one, but we'll let that one slide).<br/><br/>""Devil wears Prada"" wants to recapture the spirit of those movies and wraps it up in a nice little adult package. No, not ""adult"" like that. Adult as in ""I know what/who Prada, Dolce&Gabbana and Hugo Boss are"". As a matter of fact, a few ""adult"" things wouldn't hurt this movie, since even though there are gorgeous women aplenty, the sexiest scene involves a lacy bra which was probably considered raunchy and daring in late 1930s. <br/><br/>Anyway, getting back on subject. So this is basically a kid's flick. Does it work? For some people, yes. If you are a person who enjoys fashion, watching gorgeous people wearing pretty and expensive clothes and like your movies to be pure light entertainment choke full of good old clichés, man, you'll have a blast watching ""Devil wears Prada"".<br/><br/>For the more demanding audience, the movie will most likely serve as an equivalent of a coffee break - you enjoy it, there isn't really anything bad about the entire experience yet you couldn't call it a high point of your day nor will there be anything to remember about it in the next week. Or, more probably, in the next hour. You'd be more inclined to spend some serious dough on some designer stuff you don't really need, so beware.<br/><br/>In the end, this is just a children's movie wrapped up in the grown-up package, but the package is very transparent and the toy inside is the one we all played a little bit too much with. Lassie came home, Snow White woke up, Red Riding Hood didn't get eaten up by the Big Bad Wolf and our little Andy Sachs who dreamed of becoming a journalist... well, I wouldn't dream of spoiling this for you. Small hint, though: no alien bugs will be hurt in this movie.<br/><br/>4/10, mostly because I saw this too many times already"

The story was the usual Cinderella type blah blah blah.. Nothing new and mediocre. It should have been a comedy film but I never had a big laugh or anything higher than my average laugh. The ending was hanging too. I was searching for more and quite surprised that it was it.<br/><br/>The only thing this movie should be proud of is its actors. Streep, Tucci, Hathaway and breakthrough Blunt were great. Their acting were one of smoothest and most natural I've ever seen.

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is the best movie I have seen all year! Hands down. This is a wonderful movie that has some of the best acting I've ever enjoyed on screen. The film says ""quality"" from beginning to end. It's for people who like real movies more than Hollywood formula tripe.<br/><br/>I think that most everyone knows that Meryl Streep is one of the greatest living actresses this country has ever seen, and she proves that to the max in Prada. I believe this may have been her finest role. Meryl Streep plays ""the Devil"" (Miranda Priestly) and Anne Hathaway plays ""Emily"" (Andy Sachs) in this wonderful comedy which is also a movie about choices and values. I will tell you nothing about the plot. It's best to let it unravel before your eyes. Is it about working in the fashion industry for the top fashion magazine. Who would have thought that could be so fascinating?<br/><br/>It will have you laughing hard from human interest type comedy, and it will have you sympathizing with both the ""victim"" and the ""villain."" In the end, it will have you crying. Take my word for it, this is a truly wonderful movie that will lift your spirits and keep you glued to your seats. Do your friends a favor - take them to see this. They will be grateful that you have such good taste.<br/><br/>I give this 10 out of 10 stars, and I would give it double that if I could. This is the best movie of the year. If Meryl Streep doesn't win an Academy Award, then no one should get it. No one can top her. She is just too good."

","I don't even like Anne Hathaway and LOVED the movie. Meryl Strep was so incredible that her performance shadowed over the dull, too-young Anne. I think Anne has potential to make it big, I mean she had more than 15 minutes of fame. Big name actors are doing films with her, so this must mean something. Okay, I guess she won me over. Go see this movie with your girlfriends or mom. If you are a man, take your lady to see this. MAJOR brownie points....This is the kind of movie that closely followed the outline of the book. The book was absolutely fantastic, can't put down kind of book. The one you want to take to the beach and read all day long. The movie you will love to watch time and time again. When it comes out on DVD, put it in your collection. Right beside of ""Notting Hill"" and your collection of ""Sex and the City"" It will steal your heart."
"jackihollywood","7","2","5","5 July 2006"," Why Couldn't Andy Sachs Have it All?
","Over the weekend I happened to catch Hollywood's latest chick flick fare served up lukewarm, lightly salted and without butter of courseThe Devil Wears Prada. I'm sorry to say that it was the same old tired, coming-of-age, high-browed moralistic, princesses are always pretty and nice, drivel. Not that I need those 106 minutes back or anything. I'll be o.k. But c'mon. Enough already! Let's portray the real world, shall we? Just once. (No, this cinematic commentary on the fashion industry was not expected to portray the real world.) I don't mean some swanked out MTV pad where washed up actors and wanna-be's torment each other on cable airspace either.<br/><br/>No, I mean the real world, where girls pay rent (until they can buy a house) make student loan payments and car payments and credit card payments and blow money on great vacations in some sunny locale, (where hopefully tanned, hard, body shots are involved).<br/><br/>It's nice to be moralistic. But it's even nicer when you can afford it. The long and the short of it is we pay our dues until we get to where we want to be. And like a closet stuffed full of designer labels, it's different for all of us.<br/><br/>She has a boss from hell. Whose isn't? That's where they cut their teeth and your self-esteem all in a day's work. Get over it! If you're competent you'll be fine. If you're not, figure out how to get competent. There's already more than enough incompetence going around. Look at our current administration. The level of incompetence is criminal.<br/><br/>In our fairy tale, the devil has an unusually large set of matching boules. This is why she can't keep a husband. No man wants to be Ms. Miranda Priestly. Honestly I can't help but wonder why. There seems to be an abundance of lazy/incompetent men who could surely benefit from the steady hand of a competent woman. See Supreme Court, Senate, or White House. Surely I am many years ahead of myself.<br/><br/>While working for the devil our sweet princess develops her own set of boules. Boules make a great fashion statement. Although they are usually reserved for men, they have an unusually transformative effect on women. Basically, they turn them into bitches. My gawd, just living in New York (the main setting for our tale) provides fertile enough growing conditions for that. I ©New York! I'm not advocating bitchiness. When a man is a leader, no matter how many heads roll, how much of a SOB he is, or how many expletives he uses, he is, well a leader. When a woman is a leader, even if she doesn't engage in any of the former (and especially when she has several males reporting to her) she is a bitch. I don't make the rules I just observe the rats in the lab.<br/><br/>After this manifestation our heroine has a choice. She can stick with her loyal, tried and true, souse chef boyfriend, whom she has clearly outgrown. Or go for the slick, hot, journalist who knows how to work the system. Why not learn a few tricks of the trade? The problem with this story is our fearless heroine doesn't know who she is yet. She's growing up and she's cute. Let's not forget that. After about a decade in the trenches she will figure out who she is. But maybe she won't be cute anymore. That depends on whether a) She takes care of herself. b) She doesn't take care of herself, but can afford corrective surgery. c) She takes care of herself and develops confidence and conviction and makes her own choices. But until then she is an apprentice.<br/><br/>Dear sisters, even while one is apprenticing one should be well compensated. No one teaches women to do it. But men do this. They set their price. Compensation can take many forms: Swag or bennies; Great hotels; Great parties; Opportunities for great sex; And or self-satisfaction. You have to set your price. Yes, you my dear. No one else can do it for you. Certainly, not cute puppy-dog eyed, souse chef, boyfriends. Since our heroine had not yet fully developed, she was in jeopardy of losing her own sweet self and her high-minded values. I am not knocking values. They are great! They keep the world spinning on its axis. But unless your daddy (or mommy) is a mmmmbbbbillionaire you're on your own.<br/><br/>Values don't pay the rent. Money pays the rent. And after you've made some, then you can donate to your heart's content. Why not work on the inside from a position of power? So tell me Hollywood, why couldn't Andy Sachs have it all? A hot, studly boyfriend and a glamorous job with all the trimmings, including annual sojourns to gay Paris? Why did she have to go and work in some dank newspaper office as if it were a moral victory? Why couldn't Amanda have it all for that matter? Yes, she's as cold as the ice in her martini shaker, but still. Surely, we can have it all! That message, my friends, I would pay top dollar to see!"

","I went into this movie with lukewarm expectations and came out of it extremely entertained. The cast is probably better than the material, but they were so good that they elevated it to a film that I can't wait to own when it is released on DVD. Meryl Streep is fantastic. She never raises her voices above a loud whisper, yet she commands so much fear and respect that you're in awe. I also love the way they made her up--silvery hair is a great touch to add to her icy personality. Anne Hathaway was a good choice, making Andy smart, klutzy, independent, and cleans up nice with a make-over. Stanley Tucci, Adrien Grenier, Simon Baker and Emily Blunt were perfect in their roles. It is a really enjoyable film with some good lessons about the choices that we make and their consequences. I know all the hype right now is about SUPERMAN RETURNS, but I saw that the next day and it was so boring, long and badly cast that I considered running to the next theater so watch PRADA again. Lotsa, lotsa fun for anyone."
"Ginger423","3","2","5","2 July 2006"," Disappointed
","All though this movie was very entertaining. I did not go to see it for the actors. I am one of those that spent five hours reading the book and wanted a visual for all the characters. What was distracting was the fact that the film was so very different from the book, and if any body tells you different they are lying. All though the book is not what I call 'literature' it had a lot more depth and layers that would have been fun to do in film and from what I saw in the film .. it needed the extra depth.. forget about the actors performances because without a good story it always falls flat. Anyway, for those that did not read the book I would advise you too and then ask yourself why some of the material was not film worthy? Maybe the imaginations of the producers, directors, and writers were limited and obviously could not see the gold nugget they had in front of them. In stead they turned gold into silver. This is another case were the book was better than the movie and I am sure that was to appease some of the actors and to make the story more 'hollywood'. New York as a character was not used to its fullest either. Highly disappointed."
"barryi","9","2","5","30 June 2006"," Excellent Movie(spoiler, not much though)
","I went into the movie thinking it'd be some dumb chick-flick about fashion, but it turned out to be a very good and well thought movie. They were able to create substance out of something shallow like fashion. The acting is terrific, Streep is top notch, Hathaway plays a lovable woman who you pity at first, but that changes, and she shows growth in the character Andy very effectively. This movie is entertaining from the get-go. It has a very good sound track too. This movie is somewhat predictable, but it keeps you entertained and it isn't completely obvious. I thought the best aspect of the movie was watching Hathaway turn into a clumsy lovable woman into a superficial fashion diva. I gave this movie a 9 because it was very well done, but not a ten because I thought the ending could have been improved, and they made sure to fix every mistake(just about...not every one though), and I would've liked to see the ending not be the typical ending(even though she makes mistakes....everything is perfect in the end)."
"missygoldstein","5","2","5","1 July 2006"," Pretty Good
","I read the book years ago and thought it was campy fun. I thought the movie was sorta fun, but not campy or snarky enough. I always love Meryl Streep (who doesn't?), and I thought she did a great job as Miranda, the boss from hell, however I would have liked to have seen her meaner. Frankly I didn't think she was as awful as her character was depicted in the book and it would have been more fun if you could really hate her, which I didn't. <br/><br/>I thought Hathaway was good as Andrea, the dough eyed idealistic assistant who at first rolled her eyes at shallowness of the fashion world, but quickly embraced it and became what she had mocked. I also thought it might have been more fun to see someone really transform from an ugly duckling to a fashinista swan, but Hathaway, even with her dowdy clothes and plain jane look....still easily looks like someone who WOULD fit in in a place like that. So there was hardly any ooing and ahhhing when she changed her look<br/><br/>I thought it was cliché how all her friends were angry with her for becoming a slave to her job. It was very Hollywood. She had a very demanding job. She didn't choose her job over her friends. She began to like her job and wanted to dedicate herself to it. If it WAS a journalism job (the job she really wanted) would her friends have been more understanding? <br/><br/>SPOILERS I thought the whole sleeping with the enemy thing and then ""accidentally"" finding out that Christian was a bad guy was way too easy. <br/><br/>In a movie like this I feel the lines of good and evil are not clearly drawn. While it would seem that Andrea was good and Miranda was bad I wasn't so convinced of either. I also thought it was extremely hokey how she called that bitch and offered her the clothes she got in Paris. She sucked up to people who treated her like hell. It just made her seem not so nice, but sort of pathetic."

","If Meryl Streep had been given a larger part in this movie, I would have given it a 10. Her performance is so pitch perfect and delicious, that you can't wait for her to show up again and again and again. Her Miranda is a juicy, imperious, richly layered character, for whom you actually feel sorry at times.<br/><br/>The shoes and outfits are to die for, and you just can't imagine any other settings for this movie than New York and Paris. Anne Hathaway is merely OK. She is beautiful and can certainly act, but she is not THE star. Meryl steals the show and runs away with it.<br/><br/>I was somewhat disappointed with the lack of gossipy details about the fashion industry. We get glimpses of how the magazine, Runway, is put together, but no real meaty stuff. So much time and energy are spent on the secondary characters, that one of the primary characters, the fashion industry, is given short shrift.<br/><br/>But all in all, this movie was worth every dollar I spent to see it."
"GeneR777","9","2","5","1 July 2006"," A Refreshing Comedy -- I'll probably see this one again.
","This movie makes a good case for adapting spicy books like The Devil Wears Prada. Rather than overtly conforming to Hollywood formulas which pace romantic comedies at 90 minutes, this film is a hilariously fun film which takes a breezy look at the fashion industry and its various players.<br/><br/>All three principal characters played by Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway, and Stanley Tucci, are immensely pleasurable to watch. We enjoy them because they relish what they do, and what they do is not very nice.<br/><br/>The joy in this film is seeing the constant degradation of the main character played by Hathaway. But the flip side to the constant dumping which also makes the film equally pleasurable is seeing some cunning moves by her character that earn her a measure of respect.<br/><br/>You do not have to be a woman to see this film. In fact if you have a basic IQ which allows you to speak in complete sentences, to understand sarcasm and have had experiences with Ultra Type-A personalities you will probably relate to and enjoy this film.<br/><br/>This is a good date movie. It is also a good way to unwind if you have had a long week."

Stanley Tucci is, as always, 'par excellent', Emily Blunt is on her way, and above all, the lovely Anne Hathaway puts Cinderella to shame.

I usually get very bored with movies and find myself looking at the time a lot just to see when the movie will end, but I cannot say I wanted to look at the time once during this movie. By the time the credits came, I was sitting there wanting more. Anne definitely gives it her all in this movie, and Meryl is absolute genius. Though this is not the funniest movie out there, there are times where you laugh your butt off or just sit there in shock because you can't believe what the person just did or said.

","I have to disagree with blackbird2379 about the movie being faithful to the book. In the book Andy did not live with her boyfriend, she shared an apartment with Lilly, her childhood friend. The reason Andy goes to Paris is because Emily has mono and is too sick to go. No question of Andy being chosen over Emily. Whilst in Paris, Andy learns that Lilly has been in a serious car accident and Andy's parents and her boyfriend (Alex in the book) ask her on the phone when she will be returning to visit Lilly who is in hospital in a coma. When she tells Miranda about her friend, Miranda congratulates her on choosing to stay in Paris, rather than returning to the States. This does not sit well with Andy and she tells Miranda in no uncertain terms what she can do, and leaves for home.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I enjoyed the movie, except that when Miranda and Andy were in the car together, I could not hear what Miranda was saying. Can someone enlighten me as to what she said to make Andy quit?"

","I finally got around to seeing this after all the talk about Meryl Streep's performance. While she was good, I found Anne Hathaway and Stanley Tucci to be on her level.<br/><br/>When a young and somewhat naive woman, Andy (Hathaway), goes on a job interview for an assistant position, she gets more than she bargains for when it turns out she is working for an icy editor of a prestigious fashion magazine, Miranda (Streep). Her focus remains with being a journalist, but to get a crack at that job she must get through the tedious task at working for Miranda. To put herself in the good graces of her demanding boss, Andy ends up distancing herself from her boyfriend and friends. Soon she begins to question whether she is actually growing further and further away from her career aspirations.<br/><br/>While the critical acclaim has gone to Streep, I really enjoyed Hathaway. It's rather refreshing to see a young actress who isn't blonde and rail-thin. While Hathaway is known for her Princess Diaries fame, she might just be on her way to higher profile films. Staring opposite Streep might be a good start. Hathaway reminds me of a younger Julia Roberts. Stanley Tucci also stands out as the magazine's art director, who turns out to be Andy's confidant, helping her stay on her feet and handling Miranda's ruthless demeanor. A secondary character in itself is New York City, which is beautifully captured by cinematographer Florian Ballhaus.<br/><br/>In closing, the story is somewhat syrupy with its conclusion, but its actors make the film enjoyable."

Needless to say, I was mighty thrilled by the story of this ""normal"" New Yorker finding her place and working her way up the rank as the assistant to the indomitable queen of Haute Couture, Miranda.<br/><br/>Subsequent rewatches haven't struck the same chord. The character arcs do not seem convincing, especially that of Andy, played by Anne Hathaway. Who is Andy anyway? There's little we know about her. What makes her so resilient to all the taunts and insults thrown her way? What prompts her sudden switch from mocking fashion to embracing it? How many free goodies is she entitled to anyway as a secretary? Her final seemingly righteous decision to quit seems to have little foundation backing it up. Similarly, why is Miranda such a boss-zilla?<br/><br/>There were also a bunch of wrong or mixed messages thrown in without resolution. Like, is it really wrong for a woman to prioritise her career to a point of obsession that she will always be penalised for it? There were many scenes where Andy's bf was acting like a grown-up attention-demanding baby and yet, they showed the lady in bad light.

If you're so smart, why didn't you look up the name of your boss prior to the interview? She literally didn't know who Miranda Priestly was. My English and Business teacher taught us that we needed to research the company that you're applying a job for prior to the interview. It's important to dress appropriately for your career. If you don't care to dress fashionably, at least dress professionally. *Hint: A lumpy Sweater and hideous skirt are not professional! Try a button up shirt with a professional blazer, and a matching pencil skirt.* By the way... Andy did not work hard to get that Harry Potter manuscript, she simply knew the right guy to get it.<br/><br/>Her boyfriend: The glue that ties their relationship together is misogyny... I'm not kidding. Noah starts being an asshole as soon as he comes on the screen. Nash literally insults his girlfriend by joking that she couldn't get a job at a fashion magazine in person (granted, Nick has a point, but still). That time Numa literally celebrated his girlfriend almost quitting her job. That time he got mad that his girlfriend was late on his birthday when she informed him that she would be late. That time Neville said they don't have much in common now that she likes fashion and doesn't make fun of those girls; so the thing that brought them together was misogyny... Sad thing is she takes him back in the end. <br/><br/>Her friends: people who seem to get mad that she has a job and responsibilities. <br/><br/>The Ending<br/><br/>If the ending were up to me: Nigel would get his promotion, Andy would get a promotion in the fashion industry and end up with Christian Thompson, and Christian Thompson would not be a tool."

","Let me begin by saying that i'm actually very grateful that i got to watch this film. Don't get fooled by the rating, because the gamut of emotions this film is capable of inducing in you is really unprecedented.<br/><br/>At first TDWP seems like a regular ""@sshole boss vs intimidated employee"" flick. You know, one of those generic ""feel real bad and then feel real good"" movies where the punchline is always some kind of a liberation act when all the previously suppressed frustration is finally let out, which by some miracle sets everything right.<br/><br/>But no, this film went quite a bit ahead. It actually attempted at showing us a Stockholm complex in action. To show us how a person with self-esteem, ambitions and education can turn into a mindless female robot crazed with vain glamour and conspicuous consumption of the fashion industry. A person who is treated like sh!t at work but grows to love that slave's status. A person who betrays her former moral ideals for an illusion of success and importance. A person who doesn't simply fail at saying ""No"" to the things that frustrate her or make her feel uncomfortable but actually goes to embrace screaming ""Yes!"" to them all at the top of her lungs.<br/><br/>Now that's how The Devil Wears Prada could've made history. Just by doing this and not saying anything else. Because that would've been the boldest move in the history of modern cinema, an apex of naked sexism and an attempt, beautiful in its insane straightforwardness, to show women as they really are: DUMB. And not just dumb, but devoid of any will to control their lives. Devoid of any intention to stop an abusive boss whose abuse is so blatant that any person with even a tiniest spine would've slapped or - even better - sued her, or to resist a creepy so-called admirer and a drunk rapist who's so full of himself that it's plain ugly. Devoid of any guidelines in life that would've helped making right choices at the crucial times. Leave it like that, and you get an all-time masterpiece, albeit hated by the whole womankind and scorned by the p#ssy whipped critics. Who would've cared? The mankind would still worship it for finally making a statement about what everyone of us knew all along.<br/><br/>Alas, dumbness is more common in Hollywood than courage these days. And since TDWP's writers are both female (and the director is most certainly p#ssy whipped), the film didn't stop after the second act. Instead, it decided to give us a naive attempt at a protagonist's redemption, followed by an equally sappy happy ending. Which only proves the point the film was making all along: that only a totally dumb woman would think that a few smiles and a couple of ""i'm sorry""s could fix any predicament you got yourself into.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's not a movie character that is the source of all this idiocy. It's the people who created, approved, produced and eventually eagerly consumed it to later view it as their role model. Which ultimately turned what could've been a revolutionary coming-out of all the modern industry of making money out of the women's inherent vices into an outright advertisement of one. A highly expensive advertisement most people even paid to watch. A hymn of stupidity, just like those $1900 handbags."

Can't really understand the low IMDb rating. Not every movie is like Godfather or Shawshank Redemption with deep implications, and it doesn't have to be.

","This 2006 Pictures 2000 Production, based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger, is a comedy, yes, but simultaneously it deals with the character of the individual persons and how they affect others around them. Succinctly, it is a story about a very recent graduate from Northwestern University who rejects Stanford Law School to go into journalism, but ends up going to New York to work for the company known as Runway Fashion, and for her it is a foray: she doesn't know the first thing about fashion; the girl, Andrea Sachs (Ande) is played well by the attractive Anne Hathaway. Meryl Streep plays the very demanding supervisor-so cold, overbearing, unbearable, unsmiling, and so seemingly-heartless that she is referred to as a witch. Emily Blunt plays the secretary Emily, a young British lady who herself is unsmiling, hateful, and bitter; she is so much like Amanda in personality, yet, despite this, or maybe because of it, she and the ""witch"" Amanda don't get along well with each other. Both are initially very ugly toward Ande, but that does change later. Stanley Tucci plays Nigel, a somewhat sissified man who, however, in his own strange way does help Ande. Despite Ande's awkward start, she soon does begin to do her job efficiently and thus proves herself, and thus also betters herself, but her friends begin to think that she is changing toward them, and not for the better. At the same time it is unfair of them, and especially her boyfriend, to be ugly toward her, though the vice-versa of that isn't true. (Does anyone follow the Golden Rule anymore?) The setting is not only New York but also Paris, which is very glittery at night. Again, it is a comedy but also a very introspective movie, and worth the time to see it."

","Meryl Streep as Miranda was awesome! I love how she showed a human side to Miranda but remained the demanding and bitchy boss. Although the movie deviated quite a bit from the book, I think it successfully showed how Andrea was being consumed by her job in terms of her identity. Perhaps due to the time constraint, it didn't portray the breakdown in relationships as effectively. I didn't like Andy's boyfriend in the movie. He was nowhere near as desirable or compelling a character as Alex in the book. The whole Lily-becoming-an-alcoholic-and-getting-into-a-coma element was completely removed as well, which made Andy's decision to quit less convincing. I would have loved to see the book faithfully portrayed on screen, but I think the movie was independently pretty good."

","First of all, this movie is tagged as ""comedy + drama + romance"". The only accurate tag is drama. Honestly, there's no comedy in this film, and also no romance. It's pure drama.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep, of course, handles her role to the usual high standards. She is very convincing, and her acting is always brilliant.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway's acting is O.K. this time (she is usually not very good; this is one of her better performances), but the trouble with her character is that ""Andy"" is unlikeable from the start, and only gets more and more so throughout the movie. She is snobbish, over-confident, annoyingly smug and arrogant, which makes her unattractive to the viewer.<br/><br/>Also, they went way over-the-top with her initial I'm-clueless-about-fashion image. Not at all believable and looks thoroughly fake, as does her attitude. I usually enjoy a movie where makeover is involved, but this was just lame.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt is very charismatic and pleasant to look at, but, unfortunately, she turns in a mediocre, annoying performance i.e. she overacts -- constantly.<br/><br/>None of the male characters were properly developed. The gay dude was downright annoying (reminded me of that OBNOXIOUS a***hole from ""Sex and the City""). Andrea's boyfriend was unremarkable; he's just kind of there and doesn't fit in with the story. Neither does her second love interest. There zero chemistry between them.<br/><br/>And, well, I just didn't get the message. What was the bottom line?

","The Devil Wears Prada is a comedy drama that is a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's best-selling novel of the same title about a young woman who stumbles into the hectic worlds of high fashion and publishing.

As she quickly learns, Miranda is a diva with plenty of power within the magazine business and she isn't afraid to use it, and though she lands the job, she soon learns that working for Miranda could test the patience of a saint thanks to her endless demands and refusal to acknowledge the end of a work day.

","I enjoyed the beginning of this film I won't lie, but as it dragged on, the lack of a twist led the dull and obvious storyline to be one not to my liking.<br/><br/>I think the biggest let down for me was being a fan of Hathaway I thought she was wrongly cast for the role of Andy. She's a budding journalist who lands a job at a big fashion company and in order to fit in she feels she has to 'transform' into a fashionista. The big reveal was a disappointment, okay her previous clothes weren't cool, but somebody as hot as Anne doesn't need labels. Not only that but although some outfits (her blazer and wet look leggings look) were stunning, I found some were a let down. They also kept on about her weight which when she apparently dropped a dress size, was unnoticeable.<br/><br/>For me this film was a let down with even the romance narrative taking a backseat."
"terry-burton-327-156921","5","1","2","29 March 2012"," Just OK
","Meryl Streep is always great, and I thought she did a great job as Miranda, the boss from hell, however I would have liked to have seen her even more evil. Frankly I didn't think she was as awful as her character was depicted in the book and it would have been more fun if you could really hate her, which I didn't.<br/><br/>I thought Hathaway was good as Andrea, the dough eyed idealistic assistant who at first rolled her eyes at shallowness of the fashion world, but quickly embraced it and became what she had mocked. I also thought it might have been more fun to see someone really transform from an ugly duckling to a fashinista swan, but Hathaway, even with her dowdy clothes and plain jane look....still easily looks like someone who WOULD fit in in a place like that. So there was hardly any ooing and ahhhing when she changed her look I thought it was cliché how all her friends were angry with her for becoming a slave to her job. It was very Hollywood. She had a very demanding job. She didn't choose her job over her friends. She began to like her job and wanted to dedicate herself to it. If it WAS a journalism job (the job she really wanted) would her friends have been more understanding? SPOILERS I thought the whole sleeping with the enemy thing and then ""accidentally"" finding out that Christian was a bad guy was way too easy.<br/><br/>In a movie like this I feel the lines of good and evil are not clearly drawn. While it would seem that Andrea was good and Miranda was bad I wasn't so convinced of either. I also thought it was extremely hokey how she called that bitch and offered her the clothes she got in Paris. She sucked up to people who treated her like hell. It just made her seem not so nice, but sort of pathetic."
"sashank_kini-1","4","1","2","26 March 2012"," ""A Million Girls would Kill for It"" yet no one is hurt, bruised or well, killed
","""A million girls would kill for this job"" is iterated with awe by Emily Charlton, Christian Thompson, Nigel and Doug when referring to the position of Miranda Priestley's assistant. It is indeed a prestige value to do work for Miranda, to answer her calls, to get her lunch, to deliver 'The Book' to her residence, to arrange for dresses, to  walk her dogs, to eh. steal a copy of the unpublished Harry Potter manuscript so that her precious daughters get to know whether Harry survives or not, to . do anything and everything SHE wishes, because YOU have become the 'coveted' assistant of Miranda Priestley, even though she may rechristen you to suit her memory. You also have to endure all her petty whims and her acidic tongue, otherwise you won't get all those precious goodies like a Chanel (or whatever the brand name is) purse, lip gloss, eye roller etc. And what happens after the initial bullying, insults and browbeating? You are still treated like dirt. Still YOU are Miranda Priestley's assistant – she can make or mostly break you.<br/><br/>The Devil Wears Prada had the potential of becoming a dark, twisted comedy drama or even a thriller had it utilized the 'million girls would kill' line literally. Emily Charleston certainly seemed envious of Andy Sachs becoming the apple of Miranda's beady eyes. She was so keen to go to Paris and meet those models, designers and writers – if only Sachs did not get appointed. She may have selected the previous assistants purposely so that they disappoint Miranda and get fired; EMILY would get to be her assistant alone, had Sachs not arrived.<br/><br/>Instead Devil Wears Prada chooses a safer, predictable approach of Sachs involvement in fashion and her subsequent understanding about herself and her true aims. Even this would've hit the mark had Miranda been a lot tamer or a lot more autocratic. When Sachs has diligently worked for Miranda, even at the cost of her close ones, and endured Miranda's irrational behavior for so long, it seems insincere of her to suddenly empathize with her boss just because her boss has her own personal problems. To me, that moment was cinematic manipulation at its worst.<br/><br/>Miranda is a highly ambitious, career-oriented woman who does not run Runway but rather rules Runway. She is the female Caligula in the field of fashion, and her own employees scurry to their respective places whenever she arrives. She does not accept anything that is less than perfect, and then she does not even give some encouragement to her designers. How can Andy Sachs, who experiences Miranda's abuse of power every day, have a change of heart after one fleeting moment of vulnerability from Miranda? She does not want Miranda to be replaced, saying that Runway is Miranda's life and baby; well, if this is how Miranda treats her baby, then isn't it better if there is a change of leadership?<br/><br/>Another factor that mars Miranda's softer side is that this is a film and not a television series, unlike the hugely popular Ugly Betty, where the villainous Vanessa Williams cools down gradually as the show comes to a close. It would take more than a single scene to convince me that Miranda is really a suitable leader of Runway. Another alternative ending that would have suited the title was to have Andy resume her work with Miranda and becoming as dominating and hard-hearted as her (something similar to All about Eve). <br/><br/>The lightweight happy ending in Devil Wears Prada robs the edginess that it could've had. Also, Andy Sachs should've left her inconsiderate boyfriend and stayed with the writer, who to me actually had some chemistry with her. All this is compromised to make the movie (and the book) more suited for young love-story-and-happy-ending loving girls. And based on the gross sales of the movie and the book, it did work for the intended audience. I found the story to be (a favorite word used by some reviewers on IMDb) smarmy, lightweight and pandering.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep seemed more like a supporting 'Miranda watches over us' figure rather than the main actress. She speaks laconically, incisively and cuttingly in a cynical low tone that does make her appear like a monster, yes, but her character did not really require Streep to say, work her butt off, like in Sophie's Choice or Out of Africa. Neither did her character have to undergo a sea of contradictory emotions that required great prowess. I am not speaking against Streep, she was Miranda, but she had a supporting influence on the main actress, Anne Hathaway. Crowing her with best actress nominations instead of supporting actress will only make DWP seem like another Meryl vehicle. Anne Hathaway makes this movie look more like her fairytale, where she meets all these people and discovers herself – shimmerier on the surface than within. Emily Blunt is given a terrible and reductive role; the writer could have done wonders with a character like her, instead she just played a sidekick. Stanley Tucci's subtle and restrained performance is also underutilized. In short, everyone, including many of the supporting parts, played their characters well, but their characters were written without much thought.<br/><br/>Putting Madonna's numbers like Vogue and Jump were awkward – I only thought they would have it in the trailer and not in the middle of the film. Speaking about Madonna, there is a slick number of hers in Confessions on a Dance Floor called 'Like it or not' which is like a middle finger to her haters. 'This is who I am, You can like it or not, You may love me or leave me, But I'm never going to stop, oh no!' she sings. Had Andy continued her alliance with Miranda and left her former, bubbly self, Devil Wears Prada would have been a sinful delight.<br/><br/>My Rating: 4.4 out of 10"

","Meryl Streep is absolutely amazing as Miranda Priestly, and I especially liked the way that, as Miranda, she never raised her voice above normal speaking level. Streep has said she based this mannerism on Clint Eastwood, who as Dirty Harry talks very quietly but still intimidates. This made Miranda much more interesting than the stereotypical, screaming gorgon she could have become. She is certainly the best thing about this movie, and I think the odds are good that she'll score a best-actress nod at the next Oscars. Miranda is also made more complex (and slightly more sympathetic) than in the book, which I thought was very good. In the book, which I recently read, the author (who actually worked as an assistant to 'Vogue' editor Anna Wintour) was very bitter and whiny about the difficulties of her former job, and she made Miranda out to be a totally two-dimensional villain with absolutely no redeeming qualities. However, the movie shows us (briefly) a different side of Miranda - we see the compromises she has had to make to get to the top, and we see the toll this has taken on her personal life. We aren't made to agree with her diva-like behaviour, but we can understand how hard her life must be.<br/><br/>I also thought that Anne Hathaway was very appealing in her role - she made Andrea more likable and less snobbish than she was in the book (although the screenwriter deserves credit for that, as well), and she looked great in the couture she wore through most of the movie.<br/><br/>The supporting players were also very good, especially Emily Blunt (as Andrea's caustic fellow assistant, Emily) and Stanley Tucci (as Miranda's loyal but beleaguered right-hand man, Nigel). On many occasions, they stole scenes from the ostensibly 'central' character of Andrea.<br/><br/>The movie, while maintaining the book's premise, does not follow the book too closely, which I liked. The entire 'Lily' subplot from the book is eliminated (readers of the book will know what I mean), and Andrea's parents and boyfriend are less significant in the movie than in the book. I agreed with these changes, though - I found those aspects of the book to be quite boring, and their omission made for a more streamlined movie.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this movie to virtually anyone, and I just hope ""The Nanny Diaries"" (another somewhat-similar 'chick lit' movie adaptation, coming out soon with Scarlett Johannson, that I am eagerly awaiting) lives up to the shining example of this excellent movie."
"Danniboi","7","1","2","3 March 2012"," Not bad.
","I quite like this film and I think everyone who starred in it was entertaining to watch. Meryl Streep is awesome as always, and so is Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci. Anne Hathaway is likable in the lead as a woman thrust into the fashion industry without any real clue as to what she is letting herself in for.<br/><br/>However what ruined the movie slightly was Andrea's so called friends. They were mean, unsupportive and judgemental, especially in the scene where she gave them all expensive presents discarded by her picky boss, only to have them make fun of her and try to make her look like an idiot in front of Miranda, and the scene at Lily's exhibition where she is basically accused of cheating on her boyfriend for receiving a peck on the cheek from another bloke. (OK, she does actually sleep with him later on, but that is besides the point). If Lily didn't want her skulking in corners with random guys she shouldn't have designed her exhibition that way and then told Andrea exactly where to stand only minutes before. Andrea's boyfriend was OK, but he wasn't very supportive either, considering the fact he knew full well that Andrea planned to leave the position at Runway after a year or so and also how stressful her job was. Andrea was genuinely sorry about missing his birthday. If she had acted like she didn't care or said that she planned to stay at Runway I would have understood his sulking a bit more.<br/><br/>Apart from that, an entertaining hour or two."
"vchimpanzee","Null","1","2","28 February 2012"," Wonderful but too short
","I didn't see this movie until after I had seen four seasons of ""Ugly Betty"", a great TV series that I enjoyed a lot. And with all the similarities between the two, I naturally found myself wanting more from this movie. On the TV series, it took the bumbling ingenue years to become indispensable. Here, it happened in just over an hour, commercials included. And I couldn't believe it was over so fast.<br/><br/>I've liked Anne Hathaway for a long time, and she was charming, adorable and quite pretty. It took her a while to demonstrate intelligence and drive but she did it admirably. At the beginning of the movie I couldn't see anything so wrong with Andy, but then I thought she was cute and attractive and didn't understand what someone working in the fashion industry was supposed to look like. Later, with the proper clothes and hair she looked amazing. Andy wasn't quite as sweet and innocent as I would have expected; with her friends she could be a little on the edgy side. But overall I liked her a lot. It was a shame to see her having to deal with moral dilemmas late in the movie, but she did what she had to, and then she did what she should. Andy is a good person.<br/><br/>Miranda was enjoyable and considerably less of a monster than one might expect. Though incredibly demanding throughout the movie, her evil persona mostly came from being relayed through Emily. Miranda seemed much more human when making the demands in person, though you get the impression one still expected to be punished severely for the least little offense. One effectively edited sequence showed Andy being harassed day after day after day, too fast for the viewer to really take in each individual action, but fast enough to convey Andy's misery. Mostly Miranda was throwing her coat on poor Andy's desk, but there was surely more to it.<br/><br/>Later Miranda showed much more of a human side and even appeared vulnerable. The night after I saw this movie, Meryl Streep accepted only her third Oscar and made a point of mentioning the wonderful hair and makeup artist Roy Helland who had worked with her on all her films for years. He really did good work; I'm not sure how old Miranda was supposed to be but she looked attractive enough to be working in the fashion industry. But in one scene, the one where Miranda actually showed herself to be the most human, she looked like she belonged in a nursing home. Was Streep really that old or was it just more of Helland's work? Either way, very effective.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt did a great job. I don't think we were supposed to like her, and I didn't in the sense of loving to hate her, but she made Andy's life miserable in an entertaining way, mostly by relaying Miranda's unreasonable expectations. But she didn't want Andy to succeed, so she made Andy figure things out more than she really helped her. Andy, forced to do things herself, eventually figured it out, and Emily ended up making us care about her.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci did a fine job as Nigel, Andy's biggest supporter. Now this is a character we were really supposed to like.<br/><br/>I recognized ""The Mentalist"" as the man with the potential to further Andy's desired career. I've never seen the show, but I sure did like him and found myself wishing I had watched his series.<br/><br/>I didn't really like Nate. One wouldn't expect a cute girl like Andy to have such an edgy boyfriend. But she wasn't really all that cute, was she? I found myself rooting for Christian as Andy had to make a choice.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a great effort, and the one weakness I observed was that it all happened too fast and we didn't really get to enjoy any single stage for all that long. Maybe a three-hour movie (commercials included) instead of two."

The other differences between those devils that mine was always saying malevolent things instead of Meryl who never falls into this.

Thus, this movie fails quickly to be interesting because Anne turns finally into the dark side and prefers her career to her friends and family.

Just when Andrea thought that she has been fired given she initially could not get the manuscript, it would be the up-and-coming magazine writer Christian Thomson (Simon Baker) who is also an acquaintance of Andrea's who said that he has it and saves Andrea from getting the sack at Runway.<br/><br/>The charity benefit which saw both Emily (who is actually falling ill) and Andrea attending along with Miranda would eventually see Andrea being favoured ahead of Miranda's senior assistant Emily (whom forgotten one of the names of the people they were meeting before Andrea bailed her out), resulting in Andrea being chosen to go to Paris with her boss instead of Emily who have been boasting about it for some time. But just as Andrea is about to break the bad news to Emily, Emily is being met with an accident. The two had a confrontation at the hospital, before Andrea left for the art gallery which her friend Lily (Tracie Thoms) opened. Andrea saw Thomas there who gave her a kiss on the cheek, much to the horror of Lily. Andrea then confronted her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier), telling him that she is going to Paris. The two realises that they have nothing in common, and broke up.<br/><br/>It would be in Paris where apart from attending a fashion show with Miranda and actually meeting famed Italian designer Valentino, Andrea learned of her boss's personal plight and the day after, learning that the editor-in-chief of the French Runway magazine in Jacqueline Follet (Stephanie Szostak) would replace her boss. But Miranda had knew of the plot all along and told a stunned Andrea after attending a luncheon in honour of up-and-coming designer James Holt (Daniel Sunjata) of how she would announce during the luncheon that Follet will be the creative director at Holt's new company.<br/><br/>While Miranda is pleased Andrea's show of loyalty by warning her of her position at Runaway and commenting that she sees a lot of herself in Andrea, Andrea replied that she could never do what Miranda did to Nigel (as he was supposed to be creative director at Holt's new company). But Miranda pointed out that she had already done so, by stepping over Emily. And told her that the choices she has made are necessary to lead the life that she is living. After the two had reached the event from the luncheon, Andrea did not follow Miranda and walked away, throwing her phone into a fountain on the Place de la Concorde when Miranda called her.<br/><br/>It may be a film more suited for the younger set and for those who are interested in the insights of the fashion industry, the film which is a loose screen adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's novel of the same name (which Miranda Priestly is said to be based on Vogue editor Anna Wintour), is surprisingly good. This is from someone whom like Anne Hathaway's character early in the film who has not much dress sense and has a vague idea of the fashion industry. Meryl Steep who plays the Runway editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly portrayed it well, and Hathaway as the aspiring journalist who dreams of working for The New Yorker one day, did the similar thing in her role as Andrea Sachs."

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is one of those movies that some people will watch and come to love, while others may watch it unsatisfied. That's because despite some of the outrageous humour regarding the demands of the devilish diva Miranda Priestly (portrayed by Meryl Streep), the movie actually has a lot of subtleties in its tone and overall message. And believe me, there's a message. Many, in fact.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway is generally likable and believable in her role as Andy Sachs, an aspiring journalist in New York City, who becomes the assistant to a high maintenance editor-in-chief of America's hottest fashion magazine. She is outshined, however, by the brilliant Emily Blunt, who is sassy and hysterical in the snooty role of Emily who easily becomes many viewer's favourite character. We also have Stanley Tucci convincingly playing another co-worker along with Andy and Emily, managing to make him likable despite a few petty insults he makes towards our protagonist near the beginning.<br/><br/>Then comes Meryl as Miranda. Words cannot describe how much you'll adore this character. She is oozes class, elegance, and beauty in a unique way. Streep immediately IS the character and remains in character in every second of screen time. She never even loses the slight sneer in the upper-lip. Her character is intimidating in a quiet, realistic way that is beyond amazing. The woman is a goddess in this film and that cannot be argued.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the film, we see many layers to many characters working at this fashion magazine. We see the shift in priorities as Andy struggles to maintain her personal life while making the climb up the corporate ladder. It's extremely interesting to watch a romantic comedy that doesn't focus on romance but instead relies on the relationship between a woman and her job, and the women she works with. The cast is strong, the material is fun and fresh, and the film is just an all-around great time! Watch it and be prepared to watch it again, because the fashion is fabulous, as are Streep and Blunt in ""The Devil Wears Prada""!"

","An enjoyable chick flick elevated by some great performances, lots of fashion sense, and common themes we can all identify with: balancing work and social life, trying to get ahead without sacrificing your morals, and the battle of pursuing a dream but not alienating family and friends.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep was admirably awful, not her acting but her character. If this is an insight into the fashion industry, I certainly don't want to be a part of it. On the flip side, it's an intriguing world we get to see a glimpse of without being overwhelmed by insider-only lingo. Anne Hathaway also does well at creating a sympathetic character we can cheer for, even though we're pretty sure she's going to somehow win everybody over.<br/><br/>This movie is like popcorn... easy and fun to eat, not too heavy but with good flavor. It definitely is above average in the chick flick genre, and I believe its appeal will be wider because of the humor and smarts. There's enough for the guys to enjoy with their gals, and I also appreciated it being a fairly clean movie. A few good moral dilemmas, but nothing you haven't experienced likely in your own work environment.<br/><br/>But why do people toss cell phones into water? Turn the thing off and sell it on ebay!"

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is an insiders look at the world of fashion magazines and its inner-workings in the industry. Andrea Sachs (Hathaway) is a newly graduated journalist, fresh out of college who takes an internship at Runway magazine under the editor-and-chief, Miranda Priestly (Streep). Runway magazine is a world that Andrea finds that she is not ready for.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci (""The Terminal"") stars as Nigel, Runway's stylist and friend to Andrea, who helps her to dress more professionally and be noticed by Miranda. A stressful job and home life almost ruin Andrea's life, to the point that she realizes, while in Paris, that the job is not for her, so she walks away from it all. However, Miranda holds high regard for Andrea, even as she quits.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep was wonderful as the cruel Miranda Priestly, and she somewhat resembles Cruella De Vil, and Anne Hathaway was a bit mediocre in her part. Overall though, the film was a flying success, and a great catch."

The reason to choose this movie is that appearances wear wonderful fashion, and that it is a work by which this movie depicted the woman who strives to work in love. I like such woman.<br/><br/>The main performers are Anne and Meryl. Anne Hathaway played the role of Andy.She is employed as Miranda's junior assistant but she is not careful about her appearance,and she has a hard time. Meryl Streep played the role of Miranda. She is editor in chief in famous fashion magazine, and she order Andy anything.Costume designer is Patricia Field.She is also ""Sex And The City"". Fashion is one of the necessary for this movie because Andy and Miranda work fashion magazine company which is well known by everyone.<br/><br/>Andy was employed in the editorial department of the fashion magazine as editor in chief's assistant. Everyone hope to work this company, but Andy didn't hope because she wants to become a journalist. Therefore, she is not interested in the fashion and an assistant that being possible to do is bad. Besides Miranda who is the editor in chief was the worst superior.<br/><br/>Can she endure Miranda's satanic demand? Can she become a journalist?<br/><br/>This movie's theme is ""It is a story of you who holds out to work to love."" I like this theme and she is lovely because she does her best to work and love.

","The Devil Wears Prada is a loose adaption of the book of the same name. It follows Anne Hathaway as Andy who moves to New York city aspiring to be a journalist. She ends up getting a job as an assistant to fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep).<br/><br/>This is a review coming from a blind-viewer; someone who has never even leafed through the book on which the movie is based. But from the opening lines of KT Tunstall's 'Suddenly I See' it's clear what kind of movie this is. But chick flick or no chick flick, The Devil Wears Prada is something different. It's a feelgood movie that really anyone can enjoy.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is brilliant as Miranda Priestly, the 'bitch' of the movie, who never raises her voice above usual speaking level throughout the entire movie, leading you to think there's something more to her character. Anne Hathaway, as usual, plays the charismatic and 'sweet' role and does it perfectly. It's odd how funny it is when Hathaway swears. Emily Blunt, appearing in one of her first major supporting roles here,<br/><br/>There is a bit of a story twist during the second half of the film which makes the story a little more three dimensional than how it was previously running. You get to see different sides of the central characters too.<br/><br/>You can pretty much guess the ending, but that doesn't stop you from getting a warm feeling inside and a sense of satisfaction that everything worked out okay in the end.

","Honestly, I watched the movie because my friend told me Simon Baker was in it.<br/><br/>Actually, a year prior, my mom had rented it and I said there was no way I'd watch it. I'm not into fashion, never have been, and I don't really like chick flicks. But then again, I must admit it's better than some other in the genre *cough cough I Could Never Be Your Woman cough cough*. Then again, these movies often revolve around a cute guy kissing the leading girl. Anyway, moving on.<br/><br/>I did like some parts of the movies - first of all Meryl Streep's performance, which was brilliant, despite I don't really like her (except in The Deer Hunter) - especially in the scene in Paris where she tells Andy of her marital problems.<br/><br/>I also really enjoyed the scene in the hospital where Emily stuffs herself with food after going through a period of "" a special diet"" (anorexia). Heartbreaking, that really was.<br/><br/>Also, the small things really lightened up the whole thing - the clothes, for instance /despite my dislike for people telling other people what's hip and what's not/. No offense intended.<br/><br/>I've seen this movie twice, and I already feel like I've seen it more times than A Good Year (which I have seen, without a doubt, more times than any other rom-com like movie).<br/><br/>You should see the movie if you like chick flicks, Simon Baker (or any of the other actors involved), fashion, or if you're just after some mindless entertainment."

","Some might characterize this as a""chick flick"" or a ""teen flick"" from the MTV generation. This could be true. Nevertheless, my take on this film is the enduring conflict of family values and personal ethics v. the need to succeed. <br/><br/>Anne's entrance is superlative as is her character arc while the film progresses. Streep is the perfect Miranda and Tucci is absolutely Nigel. All the actors and even cameo performers did a wonderful job. I believe Simon Baker was miscast because his ""good looks and killer charm"" were no match for Anne. <br/><br/>The actual story is believable and defines conflicts that rage from fashion icons to night manager jobs at McDonald's. These conflicts erode relationships, friendships and marriages, and they create stress, anger and doubt about how to actually live. <br/><br/>In Miranda's case, she fails while she prevails, albeit temporarily, but Andy catches herself before crossing that faint line separating what is really important from things (and people) that become out of place and out of style.<br/><br/>I read comments regarding Nigel's alleged homosexuality. What does that matter? He refers to ""a boy in Rhode Island with six brothers who pretends to go to soccer practice while reading ""Runway"" under the covers with a flash light."" But was he referring to himself? He states: ""Give me a full ballerina skirt and a hint of saloon and I'm on board!"" Can you imagine him with a big head, and a conspicuous Adam's apple in drag wearing size twenty? I do not understand the relevance of such comments as they have nothing to do with the film. This was a great blend of comedy and real life challenges that kept my interest due to high energy, characters with vitality, and sharp direction."

This movie is meant for people who have great ambitions and the more they grow in age the more they will appreciate this movie.<br/><br/>It's a great movie in a very new context with the Goddess of acting Meryl Streep. It's a movie about choices in life when it comes to career and climbing up the ladder. Too bad that people who don't understand this kind of movies comment with confidence that it is not a very good movie? Well anyone who concluded that this movie is not good enough either was sleeping during the movie or analytical skills are really below the average level. I am sorry but this movie is just great. It made me tear at the end. Yes I teared. Some people they cry for things that are sad but this movie just hits on the strings of heart. It's not a sad story... It's a real life story! If you are still on the first step of the ladder waiting to climb higher, you'd better watch this movie till the end and rethink everything that you expect awaiting you.<br/><br/>Last two scenes when Anne Hathaway leaves the car and throws her mobile is very expressive of the feel of freedom that today's career people have lost and I am one of them. The last scene is just wonderful when Merly streep admires Hathaway's decision but she chooses to continue with her style of living which made her lose two husbands and lead a miserable personal life for the sake of feeling the power she got herself used to.<br/><br/>There you go, this movie tells you which path you would love to find yourself in; is it power vs. sad personal life or freedom vs. career with no power but talks to your passion.<br/><br/>Great movie indeed ... not anyone can understand and enjoy."

","Normally, I'm quite the fan of chick flicks and I expected it to be pretty good, but boy was I in for a surprise.<br/><br/>This movie, which is about a plain girl working as an assistant to the owner of a fashion magazine, seemed to have many similarities to one of my favorite TV shows, Ugly Betty, but was no where as nearly as good. First off, Merryl Streep's character came off as annoying instead of nasty. Her constant sarcasm would prevent us, the viewer, from actually knowing what she was thinking, thus making Streep's acting appear almost nonexistent. Anne Hathaway, whom I had enjoyed watching in Princess Diaries, didn't have many redeeming values herself. Besides letting her job rule her life, thus preventing her from seeing her friends, she couldn't even reconcile with her boyfriend after she had quite her job, partly cause she was cheating on some other jerk that was full of himself. They just decided to go their separate ways and just left it like that, which made me even more annoyed because they could've simply worked it out and gotten back together, but their splitting up just left me annoyed. On the note of her boyfriend, he didn't have much redemption himself. Sure, he was a nice guy, but was an extremely annoying sap that got all angry at Hathaway because she was working too much, which was ridiculous.<br/><br/>As you may already know, Devil Wears Prada was actually based off a novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberger. As practically always, the book is better than the movie, but this time much stronger. The end was totally differ en, there was different characters, and was overall superior to this poor excuse for a chick flick.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie was funny at times, but generally unacceptable. I suggest you should ditch the chick flick version and read the original chick lit version of the same name."

","I liked this movie a lot, I really did, but there were some gaping plot holes and whole scenes could have been cut to make a better film. And then there was that awful music...<br/><br/>The treatment of Nate, the boyfriend, was inconsistent and we wonder why Andi stays with him when he's so unsupportive, whiny and generally unsympathetic. Andi slept with another man in Paris, after she and Nate broke up and that little plot thread is simply dropped. Also, when they make up after she quits she appears to agree to move to Boston to be with him, yet a minute later she accepts a job at a New York based magazine.<br/><br/>The film should have ended when she threw her cell phone in the fountain. The following scenes were superfluous and unnecessarily lengthened the film.<br/><br/>Now for the music. The score was fine what was not fine was the really loud source music that blasts you out of your chair every time there is a montage (and there are a LOT of montages). We were constantly on the remote. If you turn down the volume so the music doesn't deafen everybody, then you can't hear the dialogue, especially Streep, who plays Miranda very low key. If you can understand the dialogue, then the music is painfully loud.<br/><br/>Good stuff. Miranda's ""cerulean"" speech. Emily Blunt. Stanley Tucci. The script, except where noted above, was very good. Anne Hathaway is a good actress but can't hold a candle to Streep, at least not yet.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth seeing; just don't expect an unadulterated masterpiece."

Well selected roles denote careful calculation as to demographics and current HBO popularity and appeal. Every aspect of this film has been done (and done better in any number of earlier films) and the results suffer sadly. It is apparent to the main character that the people, the business, the buzz is as phony as their smiles...Yet, she somehow forsakes all that she holds dear to ""apparently"" (NOT) become one of them?

As it drew to a welcome conclusion she observed that I had predicted perfectly.<br/><br/>The extreme makeover scenes were done better by Sandra Bullock and Michael Caine in Miss Congeniality. The metamorphosis was much more dramatic. (Of course, this is one of the clichés.)<br/><br/>Adrian Grenier's character was so under-developed that he barely existed in the film.

"mcsheehey","5","1","2","2 June 2007"," Vastly Unbalanced: More Devil, Please!
","The saddest thing about ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is that it had the potential to be such a great film, but ends up drowning in its own mistakes. Though Meryl Streep is the referenced title character and is easily the biggest name in the film, she actually takes on a supporting role. The leading lady is really Anne Hathaway, who is the subject of corruption by the fashion industry.<br/><br/>The storyline of the film is rather simple. Anne Hathaway's character is a very smart, mildly attractive, and ambitious girl who aspires to be a great reporter. She eventually decides to interview for an internship under Miranda Priestly (Streep), and of course gets the job. Working beside Emily Blunt's and Stanley Tucci's characters, she finds herself becoming entwined in the fashion industry, wearing more ""stylish"" clothing and attending high-class parties and such. From here, a ""Mean Girls"" type drama plays out, turning the film on to a much more serious route. The problem is, we've seen it all before. With such a typical and obvious plot, you need a really great cast to pull it off.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep gives a fantastic performance as Priestly, always delivering that trademark charm and unique evil. The problem is, we don't spend enough time with her. In fact, I would have much preferred a biopic of Streep's character to this film. Emily Blunt also gives a funny performance, but she also is on-screen too little. Tucci is kind of a bore, giving the same performance he' given tons of times, and then we have Anne Hathaway. Hathaway is not a bad actress, but she is a dreadful bore in the film. The fashion bits and her romantic life are boring and uncomfortable to watch. Still, I would blame this more on the script than the actress.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Prada"" is not a terrible film. It's simply an average film where we see too little of the should-be and supposed leading lady."

","Streep's performance is great, and I love her speech about why Andy is wearing a cerulean top (and it's NOT because she's got no taste). There is a genuine moral to this tale, probably not the one the makers intended: when you leave university and find not everyone is clamouring for your services, learn a little humility. And whatever you're doing, care - even if it's flipping burgers. But I expect idealism wins in this film - I didn't make it to the end. If you work at a magazine, it is too painfully like real life. A few random comments: I suppose Anne Hathaway was wearing a padded bra before the makeover. One day, though, can we have a film about an ugly duckling who becomes a swan where the duckling really is a bit more ugly than the luminously beautiful Miss Hathaway? Couldn't she have looked a bit more like a candidate from What Not to Wear? And finally, of course the villain has to have an English accent!"

","Yes, an entertaining bit of fluff and Meryl Streep was great, but after hearing such rave reviews, I expected more. Not only are the characters stereotypes and the plot predictable, but in a way that is irritating to real career women. Powerful women are vilified while sweetness and innocence win out. When are we going to see happy powerful women, and young women who demand that their friends and boyfriends support their career choices? The story also assumes that in some fairytale land one will have a great career without ever having to kiss up to one's boss, dress for success, miss family events, or play office politics. Any other working moms find that annoying? Or maybe that is why so many people like this movie- women, more so than men, want to believe that we can make everyone happy, have a rewarding career, and stay sweet forever. If that doesn't make you puke, you will love this movie."
"bratkievich","5","1","2","31 March 2007"," Funny but predictable comedy.
","The character arc of Andy Sachs is all too predictable: a good girl enters by chance into the fashion world, loses sight of her values and then regains them. The problem is that we're told that she becomes another person but, as portrayed in the film, Andy is the same good, hard-working person throughout the movie. Maybe it is Anne Hathaway's (and the director's) fault for not showing the alleged difference. Yes, Andy becomes obsessed with her job, but she doesn't become obsessed with fashion. When Lily and Nate tell Andy that ""she's become one of them,"" it is an unfair criticism (""them"" understood to be the air-headed people who believe that fashion is the only important thing in the world); Andy is just a truly hard-working, overly responsible girl who lost the ability to put boundaries between her job and her private life. It seems that Andy could have become as obsessed with any other job, but I'm sure that if she was working as much in ""serious"" journalism, nobody would criticize her. This, coming from Hollywood (sooo in love with glitz and glamor), is the ultimate hypocrisy. Much is done about the fact that she ""betrayed"" Emily but, as presented in the film, her choice of going to Paris with Miranda is very understandable (it's either going or getting sacked); besides, if your boss offers you a promotion, is it wrong to accept it because other people wanted it? Aaah, isn't that always the case? <br/><br/>At least the film doesn't go for the obvious jokes when poking fun at the fashion world (in the same way that ""Prêt-à-Porter"" did). On the contrary, it is presented in such a way that we understand the fascination that fashion holds for so many people. In the same vain, we get to love and hate Miranda (love to watch her; would hate to work under her). But the funniest character is without a doubt Emily, in an acerbic sort of way."

How much more 'political correctness' can a decent human being take all at once... What a load of contemporary liberal Hollywood Bu****it! Berardinelli hits the mark when in his review he asks: 'Whatever happened to hard-edged endings in satires?' Yes, exactly, what happened to them? Well, the answer is: We invented political correctness...<br/><br/>Having said that, on a positive note, the performances of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are by far the best thing in this movie, the only thing that makes this film worth watching. Again I will borrow from Berardinelli's review where he says: 'When Streep, Blunt, and Tucci are together, the scene crackles with energy. When none of them are present, The Devil Wears Prada slips into a black hole'. In other, I agree with the nomination the movie received for the costume design, which was really good. Otherwise, this was a mediocre film."

","Needless to repeat that Mery Streep is a joy to watch as the Prada wearing devil, and, disagreeing with some other reviewers here, I also liked the beautiful Anne Hathaway, like in general acting is fine in this comedy. Pictures and cinematography are (meant to be) slightly artificial but glamorous and beautiful, as well giving the picture a mixture of elegance and beauty just like a lack of naturalness.<br/><br/>But the story isn't so funny at any moment and isn't so original either to catch you at any time. Especially the end seems to be a problem. After Andy has finally adapted to the Runway milieu as well as to the demands of her boss, she quits the job in a moment where she is closest as ever to Miranda. You might argue that this gives her the freedom to finally turn her back on her and return to her former targets and personality, or you might argue that Mirandas deception of Nigel is the last straw to make Andy go, but in fact it's true what Miranda says that Andy crossed that border already when joining Miranda for Paris in Emilys place, and she could have quit before if she wouldn't have wanted to take that step.<br/><br/>I realize that there is a sub-plot making Andy saying all the time that she is forced to do this and that, and we are meant to understand that the moment when she leaves the taxi with Miranda is the one she finally realizes that it's all up to her and has been so all the time, and it is Miranda making her understand this. But still the story doesn't work for me at that point.<br/><br/>Although Andy before, while talking to her friends, has found all sorts of excuses for doing what she does, again Miranda is right in telling her that she really wants what she does and has actively decided to do it. So why should she suddenly change her mind in Paris after a few events which are not so sensational after all. They give a nice and very common turn to the film, so the producers seem to have thought, and this is probably why this turn is here.<br/><br/>I think it's the point where the movie identifies as a Hollywood movie, trying to save the young girl as the pure heroine who doesn't want to get in contact with evil and even returns to her old boring boyfriend. Miranda might represent some evil, but the truth is, she's a lively person representing both, good and evil, like most of us by the way, and Andy does so too as long as she stays with her and tries to expand her personality in a way she didn't know before. So quitting that job means a step backwards for Andy who abandons what she has reached so far."
"DonFishies","7","1","2","2 March 2007"," Better than I assumed, but Streep's excellent performance does not make up for all of its flaws
","Going into The Devil Wears Prada, I was not expecting all that much. It looked intriguing, but looked like it was a chick flick through and through. Despite Meryl Streep's obvious Oscar nomination, I still was only vaguely interested in seeing it. And despite my thoughts to the contrary, I did enjoy it a whole lot more than I assumed I would.<br/><br/>At a price of course.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a recent journalism grad who is down on her luck, and is basically forced to apply to be a personal assistant at a fashion magazine. Despite her lack of fashion sense, evil boss Miranda Priestly (Streep) hires her on, and puts her right through the gears from the start. Even with the amounting stress from Miranda and her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt), who hates Andy from the start, she has to continue to work there, or risk not having a shot at a job she really wants.<br/><br/>Thinking I was going to fed standard issue fluff, I was very surprised by how hard-hitting the film tries to be. Everyone at Runway, the fashion magazine Andy works for, are downright obnoxious. I figured they would just poke fun at her, and treat her like trash, but these people are just mean and awful to her. Although it got frequently interesting, I was downright horrified by some of the phrases and words being thrown around, and was impressed by the amount of pathos the filmmakers made for Andy's character. Watching her have to run around like an idiot added a jolt of realism that I did not expect to see at all.<br/><br/>But almost carelessly, any uniqueness about the film is thrown away in the latter half when it just becomes a cookie-cutter tale of becoming what you hate. The morality tale it slowly becomes is just nowhere near as interesting as its original ""boss from hell"" storyline. Just watching the film slip into this mode was very disheartening, and almost ruined anything the film had going for it. It was as if they realized that their novel idea was only vaguely novel, and just decided to make the rest of the film dull and predictable to try and make up for it. It essentially became exactly what I half assumed it would.<br/><br/>Another neglectful aspect of the film is the need to continually bring in Andy's friends into the mix. So much is going on with Miranda and the world of Runway that when these characters continue to enter the mix off and on, they just feel awkward and forcefully put in to help bridge gaps. All three of her friends, Lily (Tracie Thoms), Doug (Rich Sommer) and her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier of Entourage fame), just feel tacked on haphazardly, and really stand to do nothing in the film. Yes, they do have a point in it (especially Grenier's character), but none of them are developed at all, and essentially become useless in the grand scheme of things.<br/><br/>Hathaway is barely developed herself. Yes, she does go through a very drastic transformation as the film goes on, but her character's stupidity and naivety are never quite explained. We know she wants to get ahead, but any secondary details are just completely negated from being told to us. Her second love interest, Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), only continues to add confusion for the character, and just makes for some of the most clumsy and angering moments in the entire film. Her interaction with this guy should have been replaced with more scenes with her friends and/or boyfriend. On one level, she does fairly well for herself. But on the other, she just brings the entire film to a standstill, and seems to be channeling an older version of her character in The Princess Diaries.<br/><br/>Streep on the other hand, is pitch perfect in her deliciously delectable role. When she first came on screen, she looked a lot like Cruella De Vil. But as the film went on, I realized she was so much more evil than that. Her barely wincing and thoroughly melancholic portrayal is marvelous, and makes her one of the most convincing antagonists of recent years. Just watching her coldly directing everyone around her is the key to her devilish demeanour, and it lights up the film in a way that no one else manages to do. She does truly memorable work here, and more than deserved an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Supporting turns from Blunt and Stanley Tucci are both particularly memorable, if not for working great against Streep, but for completely showing up Hathaway at any point they are on-screen with her. The two of them bite right into the scenery around them, and make their supporting roles feel so much more important than they should be. I have come to expect this great level of character work from Tucci, but having never seen Blunt in anything made me have doubts about her performance. But thankfully, she delivers in spades, and makes her presence known. She will definitely be one to look out for in the future.<br/><br/>The costumes are also very well done as they needed to be. In some cases, they almost seem like they are characters themselves.<br/><br/>On one hand, the film works very well in its depiction of the ""dog eat dog"" world of fashion. On the other, it really feels like something we have all seen done before. It is disheartening, but Streep does a fine job in her magnificent role to try and make up for its shortcomings. Backed up by great supporting performances from Blunt and Tucci, she really is the reason the film is watchable in the first place. If for any reason, watch the film for her, and just ignore the storyline.<br/><br/>7.5/10."

","This film left me wanting - I expected an awful lot more. The book has been lavished with praise and many people I have spoken with have rated the story highly, so to have sat through a film which was lacking in heart, direction, warmth and any real characters was disappointing to say the least. Anne Hathaway and her friends around her are woefully miscast - it's a nice enough script, but the bland ensemble cast just don't exude friendship within their clique. The character Andy and her boyfriend seem to have the most 'meh' relationship which just bumbles along and suffers as soon as she becomes even slightly put upon by what appears to be her first 'real' job - this is simply not realistic. The staff at the Runway publication are probably better bought to life but then, they're all 2-D characters and that appears to be what the world of fashion is like - but is it incredibly doubtful that a so called very high fashion publication would hire someone as out of touch with its modus operandi as Andy.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is passable in this film but she adds nothing which couldn't be played by any other ageing, frosty, hard faced actress.<br/><br/>This movie just stumbles from one aimless section to another, with Hathaway's character having the most unbelievable about face from frump to hottie in one fell swoop, ditching her old image in 60 seconds and being noticed by the staff at the magazine for fitting in. This implausible, lazy sell out of course works and she goes on to get her dream job - as if that was ever going to be in doubt.<br/><br/>This film is best avoided and if you're looking for a chick flick, there are plenty others out there which are far more deserving of your attention."
"Leon-55","4","1","2","12 February 2007"," Sugary and predictable.
","Light entertainment with Meryl Streep playing an extremely undemanding role in a movie with basically no plot. The little plot that there is, is fantastically predictable. Meryl Streep does not really play the main character - the story is about her assistant. It looks as if Meryl is just saying her lines while trying keep bored expression on her face. And that is all that the script demanded from her anyway. I don't know if that warrants an Oscar Of course Meryl plays the role excellently (can she not?) The supporting cast did not do much in the movie - except be non-supportive - just faces filling the screen. Perhaps it is the very nature of the movie's theme - the fashion industry is notoriously superficial (whether warranted or not). And just maybe, that is all the movie can offer. Not the typical Streep performance you'd expect."
"dfroggy1","6","1","2","2 February 2007"," Streep (somewhat) classes up a banal movie.
","I'm going against the grain of what seems like the majority of critics on this one, I guess. Meryl was pretty good, but I didn't think it was the best outing of her career. The costumes were eye-popping, as befits a fashion movie, but I thought the plot was pretty lame. Character clichés abound (I don't know if absolutely EVERYBODY in the fashion industry is as totally ice-cold and self centered as they are portrayed in TDWP; I hope not) and in my opinion Andy's ""friends"" didn't cut her much slack. (I certainly wouldn't have taken the boyfriend back.) It's hard to say if this movie's really a 6, but they don't have a 5.5 rating, and it is better than a 5."
"ndtm","3","1","2","26 January 2007"," Detestable
","Sorry, but the last 5 minutes of this movie do not make up for the previous 1:45 glorifying the shallow and meaningless world of high fashion. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, we're cheering for Anne Hathaway's character to quit the job and maintain her self-respect (which was very healthy when the story begins). After denying her better judgement numerous times (why, I don't know), we lose any interest in her and cheer only for her boyfriend, one of the few characters with integrity and redeeming qualities throughout. I love Anne Hathaway and also don't have a big problem with silly movies (e.g. Ella Enchanted); I just had huge problems with how seriously we were supposed to take this phony fashion mag world.<br/><br/>The turning point for Anne's character seemed to be after this pathetic speech by Stanley Tucci's character, in which he seemed to argue that high fashion is necessary in the world, if only to give hope to closeted young gay men (or did I miss a deeper point he was really trying to make?). If Anne's character was supposed to be such a great journalist, she would not have been swayed by this bit of silliness. In fact, her whole background should have precluded her from ever having any interest in the things these people found important (i.e. she finished law school and wanted to become a journalist?).<br/><br/>I'm also a fan of Meryl Streep, but I cannot imagine how this performance (or role) is worthy of an Oscar nomination. It's a one-note character, which gains no sympathy from the viewer since she has no positive qualities. Even her one emotional moment was a joke to me and totally unbelievable for the character. Are we to think she actually cares if her husband leaves her, what the press will write, or how her spoiled kids will take it? I wasn't buying any of it. This seemed only a continuation of her 101 (102?) Dalmations role; clownish and not believable.<br/><br/>By the time we get to the end (and Anne's realization of what's important in life), we cease to care for her character, and in fact half-hoped her boyfriend would dump her (although it was never going to happen in such a soppy story). Too bad; he deserved better."
"mariaontario","6","1","2","20 January 2007"," I wish it showed more redemption and less 'being cool and hip'
","I gave this movie an 6 because Streep does a very fine job in this one. This movie somewhat exposes the shady side of the fashion industry. With the characters at the top of their game their chemistry (as characters not actors) blends well and creates a highly entertaining movie all-in-all. The story itself is very good, to be honest we see glimpses of fashion shows, New York. Everyday yet how many of us really wonder what's going on? This movie answers your questions somewhat and shows u the grit and glam that we don't see in the numbers reported daily. I recommend this movie to any Streep fan.<br/><br/>However, the film doesn't show enough of the redemption of man. It's like 'Entourage' - Hollywood is so in love with itself, yet never stops to ask why are we in love with ourselves. There's nothing funny with getting backstabbed, yet Hollywood celebrates it."

","There were two times in my life that I had the opportunity to chose something similar to Andy's job at Runway magazine. When I was in the military, I was offered the o0pportunity to work on the IG Team. It would have meant certain promotion, but I would never be home. After I left the military, I interviewed for a huge law firm and would have likely gotten the job changing their software to one I was very qualified in, but the interviewer wanted to know how I would handle picking up the lawyer's dry cleaning. I wasn't willing to do the job and it likely went to someone who would give up their life for the firm.<br/><br/>The Devil Wears Prada was an enjoyable journey back to those times, and it was a great movie. Anne Hathaway (Andy) was fabulous as she tried to find herself in a world where she was clearly out of place. I enjoyed her in Brokeback Mountain, and I am really looking forward to seeing her as Jane Austin in her next film. Meryle Streep was fantastic as her boss, and Stanley Tucci deserves a statue for his incredible performance. Of course, I may be biases as i thought he was incredible when he did an episode of Monk, and I thought it a crime that 3 lbs was cut. Tracie Thoms had too small a part in the movie, but made the most of it.

","As many people will tell you, Meryl Streep is one of the best actresses ever to be recorded on film. And I'm not going to disagree with that opinion. In fact, I wholeheartedly support it. In the case of ""The Devil Wears Prada"", it seems as though the original novel, written by Lauren Weisberger, was written for Ms. Streep. The character of Miranda Priestly is so perfect for Ms. Streep, it's scary. And, yes, this is to say that Ms. Streep pulls off the performance of her perfect-fit character with seemingly great ease, and a lot of brilliance. Anne Hathaway, who gets second billing, is Priestly's new hire, a bright-eyed young woman who knows nothing about fashion, but applies for an internship at Miranda Priestly's magazine (go figure.) The film sputters and starts, and it seems as though all the juciest writing has been saved for Ms. Streep, and everyone else gets the flip-side of the coin. The scenes that Ms. Streep is not in (about half) are tearjerkingly bad; you just can't wait for Miranda to return and steal the show again. Stanley Tucci turns in a superb performance as gay fashonista Nigel, who befriends and helps Andy, Ms. Hathaway's character. Entourage's Adrian Grenier is sleepy and dull as the token boyfriend, and he and Ms. Hathaway have an almost-negative amount of chemistry on-screen. The film's plot is almost nonexistent, and is almost immaturish in it's lack of structure and pacing, from its director, David Frankel (whom I hold in high regard for his helming of Part 9 of ""Band of Brothers""). To sum it up, Ms. Hathaway is upstaged by Tucci and Streep, even when they are not on screen. And that's about the highest praise I can give to any performance."

Even the good guys are a rather dull and colorless lot and the Fashion folk are card board cutouts. I haven't read the book on which the film is based and the film doesn't inspire me to rush out and get a copy.

Both Streep and Hathaway deliver some of the better performances of the year and the supporting cast is great as well. The make up artists are fantastic as well, doing a great job subtly changing Hathaway as she ascends through the fashion world.<br/><br/>The writing and/or editing could have done a better to flesh out Anne Hathaway's Andy with particular focus on her relationship with both her family and friends. Also at times, the film comes across as cartoon-like, not just with certain characters, which is probably intended, but also with the cinematography of New York and Paris.<br/><br/>But none of this disturbed me as much as the way Anne Hathaway's Andy develops. In the movie she takes many ethically questionable actions, many of them in a casual enough manner to be missed by most of the audience. While there is an ultimate and perhaps predictable conclusion to her actions, I felt utterly dissatisfied about the consequences of her actions. Perhaps because of this I was both drawn to and repulsed by her character. However in the end, these dichotomies may be the strongest feature of the movie, as it is thought-provoking. Since that what good movies are supposed to do, I give it high marks.<br/><br/>A warning should be given to parents of the children and young adults that will be drawn to this movie. As mentioned before, Andy makes many questionable ethical judgments and really few of these are explored to any kind of consequences. Younger member of the audience- especially ""young"" women (this likely includes any women under 25)- will have trouble identifying much less understanding, what is wrong about her choices. I'd therefore recommend any parent watch it with or before their children do."

Nice pictures though, and well photographed. This however cannot hide the supreme superficiality and lack of even a trace of interesting storyline.

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is everything you'd expect and little else. One can't help but point out the striking similarities to earlier offerings featuring Anne Hathaway -- the same Cinderellian out-girl turned in-girl protagonist, the same friends vs. career dilemma, the same cookie-cutter scorned romantic interest (courtesy of Adrian Grenier), the same formulaic character development portrayal, etc. ...<br/><br/>The screen writing is disappointingly bland for long periods of time. Meryl Streep was convincing as the subtly ruthless Miranda Priestly, and Stanley Tucci delivers in a few scenes, but the rest of the cast is thoroughly unremarkable, as are their respective shallow characters. An especially big thumbs-down to Andy's supposedly forsaken friends, whom we clearly -should- sympathize with, but who come off as simplistic jerks unsupportive of Andy's understandable ambitions.<br/><br/>There are certain saving graces. Excepting the lame final 15 minutes, the plot paces itself well; that is, there is a relatively uniform distribution of unambitious, facile, Disney-esquire ""entertainment."" But I use the term loosely, and I leave it up to you to decide whether ""entertainment"" is a reasonable term to describe 109 minutes of intermittent smart-ass conversations between Andy and Miranda, Andy and Emily, Andy and Nigel, and Andy and her boyfriend or other friends, all of which offer little in the way of interesting relationship portrayals. The movie is billed as a comedy, but there are few really amusing moments.<br/><br/>Though there are more than a few predictably trite scenes (e.g. the obligatory ""Don't you see? You've changed"" lovers confrontation), I found nothing truly gag-worthy, and the distaste came in merciful portions.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, nor do I know anything about fashion media, the fashion industry, or fashion in general. And unfortunately, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" doesn't delve deeply enough into its own premise, never really piquing my interest in the subject like I wanted it to, only managing to use fashion media as a buzzword-rife backdrop for, quoting an earlier reviewer, ""The Princess Diaries 3."" This was perhaps the greatest injustice of all."

Streep has been getting pretty much all the credit for the movie. It's not entirely fair. She is indeed excellent  you just want to strangle that bitch. But the film would be utterly worthless without a strong central performance, and Hathaway supplies it. Even when the film is at its least engaging, Hathaway makes it engaging. More her presence, I suppose, than her performance. I mean, damn, she's an attractive young woman. You'd think her smile could cure cancer, or at least bring dead puppies back to life.

Streep dominates every scene she appears in and the lead actress becomes her foil. The audience awaits the next whim that will drive her assistants to desperation, to invention, to achievement -- all rewarded with not even a snarling thank you. Although it's said to be no secret that ""The Devil..."" is said to be a young author's revengeful portrait of an actual bitch-on-wheels, Streep's character is like a creature out of a horror movie, Boris Karloff in drag, and it is a masterful performance. Ann Hathaway is charming and the first assistant, later demoted as Ann's character rises in the world, is nicely limned as is Stanley Tucci's, Streep's -- what shall we call him, managing-editor-on-a-leash -- but they are each 60 watt bulbs in the presence of a pulsing 10,000 watt search light.

","I was quite looking forward to seeing this as a 'fluffyish-girl's-night-out' kinda film but within five minutes I found my credulity stretched because I couldn't think of a single reason WHY Andy got hired and the plot made no effort to explain it. (let's face it, if the job was so hot a million girls would apply, and the interest in fashion sooooo vital,then WHY pick one so geeky as she was? On the strength of a college resume? er surely not...or has NY suddenly become a LOT smaller?) Once Andy had started the job, I just wanted to punch Meryl Streep for her sheer ill-mannered behaviour and punch Andy for not standing up to her - I mean, a simple ""excuse me but there's no need to throw your coat at me every day...."" but no, she continues to be a complete doormat, even running out on her father's dinner date to run errands for the spoilt prima donna bitch boss. Her transformation from ugly duckling to swan was even more irritating since she was hardly the 'lump' they constantly made her out to be and certainly not noticeably fatter than anyone else in the office. By the end of it I really disliked Andy and her 'return to reality' did not renew her in my estimation. I was secretly hoping the cute boyfriend would have dumped her for a nicer girl while she was in Paris with the sleazy slimeball who kept turning up schmoozing her. Basically the whole movie revolved around having one hell of a bitch for a boss and could have been neatly wrapped up if Andy had thrown her coffee in her face, told her to stop being a cow and walked out. THEN she'd have been worthy of some respect. The bit when Meryl Streep coldly demeans Andy for daring to ask what the difference is between two almost identical belts - Andy SHOULD have pointed out that it WAS nothing and then seen the light and headed out to the sort of job she really wanted where she dealt with serious and weightier issues. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. still..... even after almost a week......."

","I was really impressed by ""The Devil Wears Prada"". I was lucky one - I watched it in August in the USA in its original version. The plot is great and of course actresses are brilliant! I think the ideas of model business and fashion are one of the most trendiest topics nowadays, so the director's choice was right and extremely successful! Especially I liked the moment when Anne Hathaway became dangerously beautiful and stylish while working at the ""Runway"" magazine. However some guys I know well told me that she was beautiful enough before that. Of course it depends on person's individuality, but in my opinion she became gorgeous after Nigel's help. Meryl Streep is unforgettable too - she deserves one more Oscar for actress' play. I'm sure, that she fulfilled the Miranda Priestly role at the screen. She is pretty tough and kind of cruel sometimes, but in some scenes we see, that she has feelings too, and she is not just a stone-lady. I advice you to watch this film is you hadn't seen it yet. It is brilliant!"
"juliecogz","8","1","2","20 October 2006"," Devil Wears Prada -The Movie
","Although this is most definitely a ""chick-flick"" and very predictable, it doesn't ruin your enjoyment of the film. The laughs come from watching Andrea struggle in a world where the only things that matter are how thin you are and how expensive your clothes are (oh, yeah, nearly forgot - and how high your heels are, too!). There are moments of suspense and a sense of, ""Oh no!"" a few times in the film, but you are always pretty much aware of how it will all turn out. Sometimes, though, predictability can add to your enjoyment and this caters to that rather well. Anne Hathaway is perfect for the role of the naive but underneath-it-all hard working and smart Andy. The fantastic Meryl plays the Dragon Lady to utter perfection, never once raising her voice , yet is believably scary without having to do so. She makes the Iron Lady look like the Tooth Fairy. I took my thirteen year old daughter to see this and we sat riveted from start to finish, loving the gorgeous scenery shots (wow, Paris!) and the fabulous clothes. And yes, the absence of vile language and gratuitous sex was refreshing. A film you can enjoy with your offspring without once having to stick your fingers in their ears or cover their eyes during a raunchy bit. It's bright and glossy, fast paced and I never felt bored for a second. Go on girls; it's really good.Worth the money and the overpriced popcorn."

","i can be included in the group of guys who were pleasantly surprised. i found the movie thought provoking and funny and was still thinking about it when i woke up the next morning. i had expected a comedy and a shallow one at that but discovered more. The sequel should show Andy's character exposing the sweatshop labour used to mass produce designer togs.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway grows up, could well be the subtitle. It's nice to see actors one likes mature and take on more difficult roles. A Princess no more, Hathaway proves she has the chops to tackle a role and script with teeth.

"fish_stix03","6","1","2","2 October 2006"," Overconfident and underwhelming
","I didn't know what Prada was before I found out that the devil wore it. I assumed that it's: a.) some sort of material, or b.) some sort of fashion label. A quick trip to Wikipedia taught me that it is, in fact, option b.). I am telling you this so that you understand that I know nothing about fashion (and I'd appreciate those who know me to keep their comments to themselves), and I still found The Devil Wears Prada funny when it was satirising the fashion industry, but not as convincing when it played as a drama.<br/><br/>The Devil Wears Prada was heavily marketed as a smart comedy for a mature audience. When one boils down the plot into a one-paragraph summation, however, there is nothing ground-breaking or subversive about it. Anne Hathaway is Andrea, a wannabe journalist who lands a job as assistant to the evil Miranda Priestly (played by Merryl Streep, who looks exactly like Cruella DeVille from One Hundred and One Dalmations), the chief editor of a fashion magazine. She also works with Emily (played by the immensely talented Emily Blunt), and Nigel (the vastly underused Stanley Tucci). Andy also has a boyfriend (Adrian Grenier), and an admirer in Christian (Simon Baker), a fashion writer. Because of Andrea's initial ignorance regarding the fashion world, much of the comedy in the film's first half is fuelled by the 'fish-out-of-water' scenario. When Andy decides to take an interest in fashion (and her job), the humour dries up and gives way to an injection of drama. Which possibly may have been an overdose of drama.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway is a beautiful girl, and despite the film's best efforts to make her look ungainly in the first half, she never looks ugly. Because of this, I found the change in her character during the second half very difficult to buy. While her boyfriend and friends appear to think that she has undergone a personality botox (despite her saying, ""I'm the same old Andy, just with better clothes""), I just saw Andy as the same person, who managed to find one or two decent tops to wear to work. The entire melodrama that follows about Andy's deteriorating relationship with Nate and her friends is predictable and dull. The theme the film is drumming into us is that it's difficult to balance work and personal relationships, but that it's important. I must say, I'd NEVER heard that one before.<br/><br/>I admit that the office of the fashion magazine ""Runway"" is an amusing place. When Nigel first sees Andy, he asks Miranda, ""Is there a before and after I don't know about?"" There are also several interesting demographics that exist in the office. There are people like Miranda and Emily, who know ""Runway"", love ""Runway"", and don't care for anyone that doesn't know or like ""Runway"". Then there are people like Andy and Nigel, who have settled on this prestigious but (for them) unrewarding job until their real dream job comes along. There was one point in the film involving Nigel and his career that broke my heart (a moment that I shall not discuss further so that I may not spoil the surprise).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, once the film spirals away from comedy and becomes more of a treatise on the dangers of losing yourself in your career, the fun slowly skids to a stop. Merryl Streep is, as usual, excellent as the ghastly Miranda, and Anne Hathaway puts in another good performance after Brokeback Mountain, but the roles of Andy's boyfriend Nate and Christian didn't sit well with me. Nate seemed to be the distant, sophisticated man, while Christian seemed down-to-earth and charming (although, he crosses the line from charming to sleazy several times). The book that The Devil Wears Prada is based on was, apparently, a phenomenon. I must have missed it. What was I doing, apart from seeing hundreds of movies, studying and reading the great works of literature of our culture? And partying.<br/><br/>While there are moments in The Devil Wears Prada that I found quite funny, the emotional core of the film was clichéd and derivative. Sadly, despite its best efforts to avoid it, The Devil Wears Prada is just like the fashion industry it attempts to parody: slick, charming and gorgeous to look at, but ultimately superficial and, at times, annoying."

","Miranda (Meryl Streep) is at the helm of a Vogue-type magazine called Runway. She is indeed a prickly, over-demanding creature who lives and breathes for herself and the magazine only. Enter Andrea (Anne Hathaway). She is an aspiring journalist who takes a job as Miranda's assistant only because she hears Miranda's name opens future doors in abundance. Andrea is not fashion gaga and she learns later that this is the reason Miranda took a chance on her. But, given the close exposure to the dragon lady, Andy begins to change. She does begin to bask in the designer duds they get as gifts and starts to neglect her boyfriend and friends when Miranda is summoning her. But, does power corrupt absolutely and does it reach those circling the powerful one? This is an interesting movie about the fashion industry. It is obviously a cutthroat business where the players come prepared to dedicate themselves entirely or get out of the way. Streep is terrific in a totally unflattering role. Hathaway is also fine as the naive young woman who learns many lessons in integrity and ethics. The supporting players are also nice, with Blunt giving a great turn as the assistant ready to sell her soul for the she-devil. It goes without saying that the costumes are of the finest and that the NYC setting is always spectacular. If you are an aspiring model or fashion designer, this movie should be required viewing. But, for anyone who wants to experience the dog-eat-dog world behind the loveliest clothes on the planet, this film will have you glued down on your chair."

","Okay my girlfriend read this book and all she could talk about was the upcoming movie. Now being a guy I'd rather not pay movie fair to see a lifetime TV like movie, but also thinking like a guy I figured if I shelled out the money and took her of my own volition I might receive a few perks. And hey Anne Hathaway is good for the eyes.<br/><br/>All that being said I knew very little about this movie upfront, except Prada is a handbag or something. I was very surprised and delighted to see Meryll Streep in the movie, from that moment on I thought I may give it a chance. Meryll being the iconic actress she is brought a lot to the movie. She is heads and shoulders above most actresses. So there I sat ready to give this movie a chance, get a few perks and maybe along the way see a good film. And I was not disappointed, Meryll brought her usually game to this movie playing a very business minded woman who only twice in this movie showed she might have a human side. Anne brought what she brings all of her films, thus far, the doe eyed, innocent girl. Even though in one portion of the film you get the idea that this may not last forever. Her acting was good, but like I said it was standard Anne Hathaway. Now the rest of this case was very impressive. Emily Blunt's character was a typical High Brow fashion queen and she pulled this off flawlessly. She is a wonderful actresses, kudos to our cousin's across the pond for discovering this talented young lady. I must not be the only one to think so as she is a very busy girl as she will be seen in 6 upcoming works. And a big round for Stanley Tucci as well whom I best remember for his recurring role in Miami Vice (TV) and as the uptight customs boss in the terminal. For him to reach in this and give an award winning performance in my book is great. I love this guy and think he is a special actor, not a leading man, but the perfect fit to almost ant cast.<br/><br/>So basically I can say this was a good effort as movie and I won on every front with it. Guys see this movie with your girl she will appreciate it and you'll get to see a decent film. Think of it like this to women this book maybe like ""Where the Red Fern Grows"" to us, or the film is to women as ""My Dog Skip"" is to men. Good on all accounts and worth seeing."

","What's hot is cold, and what's cold is hot in this brilliant fashion show of a movie - with Meryl Streep in the center acting up a blizzard. Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) applies for a job at Runway magazine, a job that ""a million girls would kill for."" By a stroke of good fortune, she gets the job immediately and is thrown into a career where ""the details of your incompetence"" do not interest the nightmare of a boss known as Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). Little does she know that is just the tip of the iceberg in the world of cutting-edge fashion. <br/><br/>Rail-thin underlings stalk the hallways in sleek high heels and pencil skirts, avoiding at all costs the woman known as Dragonlady and Snow Queen. Meryl Streep is stunning in this movie (no surprise there), and I was completely overwhelmed as this was my first viewing of one of her performances. Hathaway is charming and cute (and a little naive) as Andy Sachs - she was well cast.<br/><br/>I believe a scene I will never forget is when Miranda, Andy, and Emily (Emily Blunt) are at a soirée in New York, and it had been Emily's and Andy's job to memorize all the names of the prominent people of society and politicians - so that Miranda wouldn't have to. Andy shows Miranda how good she is by calmly whispering the name of a politician into her ear as Emily is about ready to explode with the task of trying to remember that information. The tension builds and builds dramatically, the politician gets closer and closer to Miranda, Emily is struggling for breath, and at the last moment Andy just quietly steps in and rattles off the name. (That scene is also memorable, I might add, because Miranda is stunningly beautiful in a flowing, black, elegant, strapless gown, and I have never seen a woman over fifty-five look that alluring.)<br/><br/>This movie is definitely a chick-flick, but the biting wit of Stanley Tucci would make anyone laugh until it hurt. It is without a doubt, the movie of the year."
"manicman84","9","1","2","23 September 2006"," most likely the best comedy of the year
","The Devil Wears Prada is the biggest surprise and will be most likely the best comedy of the year. It seems that the film has achieved not only financial success (over 120 million bucks only in the US), but also artistic one, which is extremely rare nowadays. Journalism graduate, Andrea has just been hired to be a 2nd assistant in a legendary Runway magazine devoted to fashion. Her psychotic chief, Miranda Priestly seems to do everything within her power to humiliate and fire Andy. The film is not another over-the-top chick flick. In fact, one may even refer to Devil Wears Prada as an intriguing and funny battle of cultures, in which people from different backgrounds and with different priorities participate. The writing always goes in the right directions as choices that screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna makes are never wrong. The movie unfolds smoothly and during the 2nd half, director David Frankel applies, aside from humour, also some moving drama-like scenes as Andy has to take important decision. Besides, the flick contains loads of unforced, mainly verbal and situational humour, which absolutely cannot be classified as stupid. Both humour and drama are superbly combined by director who captures losses and sacrifices of workers. The Oscar-worthy acting is a real highlight of this pic. Spontaneous Anne Hathaway is at the beginning sweet and later transforms into elegant chick who tries to make ends meet in his private life. As always great Meryl Streep is simply perfect as a cold editor barking comments with a sense of superiority. What's more, supportive roles are also outstanding. Stannley Tucci displays his comedic talent by delivering some smart one-liners. Emily Blunt is also great in displaying her fear for loony Priestly. All in all, skipping Devil Wears Prada is very unwise decision."

","This film is about a young graduate (Anne Hathaway) who stumbles across a job as the assistant to the Chief Editor of a prominent fashion magazine. After the poor start with her boss, played by Meryl Streep, Hathaway learns to reinvent herself and climb higher and higher up the ladder, and in the process alienates herself from her past, family and friends.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep is great as usual. She gives a fine performance as a very confident and powerful businesswoman. There is a scene in which she is weak and vulnerable, and she also handles that well.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci is also great. He plays a camp man who is very important in the magazine. His campness is so natural that for a while I thought he was gay! Anne Hathaway is lovable and adorable. It is amazing how she shot to stardom in just a few movies, and I can see why! The script is great, the dialog is witty, and the movie is fast paced and never leaves you bored. The soundtrack is upbeat and relevant, and even appropriately including the material girl Madonna's recent song! The make up is amazing as well. After seeing Meryl Streep looking very dejected and vulnerable in one scene, she becomes strong and confident again. I can't help but notice that apart from acting skills, the make up department helps a lot in this transition too.<br/><br/>I laughed out so many times during the movie as there were so many subtle jokes. It does not rely on any toilet humour or obscenities to make viewers laugh, which is very refreshing to have.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend this film, and I can't wait to watch it again!"
"bassez_love","10","1","2","15 September 2006"," Absolute fun to watch.
","Meryl Streep was stunning. If I was only allowed a one-line review, that would be it. She was brilliant, and it was such a thrill watching her bask unapologetically in her demanding, diva-like behavior. Her frigid ""that's all"" would have sent braver men running for cover, and her glare could have crumbled cement. She tossed her list of things to do the same way she did her coat and handbag on her assistants' desk: carelessly, and certain that someone would handle them exactly the way she wanted them to.<br/><br/>That said, she played the part of adoring mother and broken woman equally well, so much so that I couldn't understand how the other occupants of the fashion world could find her so terrifying.<br/><br/>One of my absolute favorite scenes of the movie came at the end, when Miranda and Andy see each other outside of the Runway building, after Andy has resigned. Andy smiles at Miranda, gives her a slight nod, and watches as Miranda slips into her car without another look. What Andy doesn't know is that Miranda is observing her from her window, with a smile -- a rare, rare gift. All of a sudden, the smile slips, and Miranda snaps ""go"" at her unsuspecting driver, giving him one of her best are-you-stupid? looks in the whole movie. I loved it. It was such a Miranda thing to do. Perfect, perfect, perfect.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway was not as disappointing as I expected her to be, either, and the performances by Stanley Tucci, Emily Blunt and Adrian Grenier (who, as Andy's neglected boyfriend, had me rooting for him throughout the movie) were spot-on, as well. My only complaint is Simon Baker, who, while walking the fine line between suave and sleazy, tipped too far right and landed in unsavory territory for the better half of the movie. He did this without any charm, mind, and any fool could have seen that he was not the type of guy Andy would have fallen for.<br/><br/>The film also had a bit of a Sex And The City feel to it (although that could just have been brought on by the big fashion names) and it was only when I googled David Frankel that I found out that he had, indeed, directed a couple of episodes for the series. There is nothing particularly interesting about his style, but it's very well done and incredibly smooth, which I admire very, very much.<br/><br/>Another thing I enjoyed was the breadth of the film. It covered family, friendship, loyalty, integrity, relationships, dieting, fashion, Harry Potter, success, ambition, stepping stones... the list goes on. Fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's all I have to say about this movie. Aside from rambling on about Meryl Streep's brilliance at playing Miranda Priestley, I don't have much else to say. Better still, I don't have many other complaints, except maybe how predictable certain parts of the plot were. That was salvaged, though, because I was surprised by many other things, like the announcement of Jacqueline as James Holt's partner instead of Nigel, as had been previously alluded to.<br/><br/>Overall, even if there had been anything fundamentally wrong with the film, Meryl Streep would have saved it from being crucified. And since there wasn't, she only added to the stellar quality."

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is one of those films based from a literary source where the primal idea is intriguing, but for someone whose thoughts function on a different wavelength, the execution leaves one dumbfounded. So there's Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a girl fresh from college, who lands an enviable job (""a million girls would kill for that"") as assistant to Runway Magazine editor-in-chief - the legendary Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep in a radically distinctive role). Hoping to get serious work as a journalist, Andy believes one year of putting it up with her arrogant boss and snotty colleagues would instantly guarantee her a ticket to the job she truly wants.<br/><br/>Okay, so I'm not into fashion. Fairly well. That being said, I don't think it should hinder me from thoroughly enjoying the film and saying I did if I really did. After an initial parallel opening sequence, the first few minutes of David Frankel's cinematic version of the novel written by Lauren Weisberger are invigorating, with an intriguing look at the world of fashion coupled with acerbic dialog.<br/><br/>After that, however, the predictable storyline seems to drag, and frequent detours - such as the scenes involving Andy's boyfriend (Adiran Grenier) slow the film down. It doesn't help that the characters are such caricatures of their real-life counterparts (uhm, yeah, I've heard the comparisons between Streep's Miranda and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour) that any intellectual penetration into their character leads to a dead-end.<br/><br/>Eventually what could have been a grand adaptation is reduced to a simplistically trite comment of the fashion world where at this point ""The Devil Wears Prada"" fails to live to its promise. It's not so much that this film doesn't work for me for the reason that it's about a world I don't inhabit; rather, it's because it doesn't manage to bring light to its protagonist in a way that's worth remembering. There are a couple of standard and unspontaneous attempts, but nothing that manifests into something that would raise this film to a universal level where one can really relate to. Hathaway's Andrea can't cast off her selfish facade enough to give us a glimpse of the true extent of her character and her relationship angle with her boyfriend Nate is too conventional. On the other hand, Streep steals the show as Miranda, who is, simply put, outstanding. Yeah, some bosses can be quite the devil and Streep incarnates this role so fully.<br/><br/>This chick lit-turned-chick flick should do well with those who have read the source material (I haven't) and enjoy the performance of Streep. Still, I can't help but feel unsatiated and mull over the fact that it could've been better. For all I care, the devil may wear Chanel and it will feel the same."

","The Devil Wears Prada How important is money and success? ""The Devil Wears Prada"" examines that question at full force with some comedic angles and struggles to engulf the viewer in the tale but comes up short like a blurb of research from a magazine column. ""Prada"" tells the story of Andrea, a naïve young woman wanting to be a journalist but ends up in the premier of the fashion world. Anne Hathaway portrays the ever-loving and innocent ""Andy"" who walks into the high-maintenance, sky rise building of the famous ""Runway"" magazine and lands the second-assistant position to the Editor-in-chief and starts her downward spiral into high heels, Gucci sweaters, and Coach Bags. It's there that she is tormented and verbally abused by many of her fellow co-workers and most of all by the editor of the illustrious publication, Miranda Priestly depicted by the great Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>Andy finds herself being rudely ignored and spoken to from minute one. Through simple tasks to her ""Plain Jane"" attire she is pitiful to all around her. As a solution to her constant anguish she decides to give into the world of trend, shape and style and finds herself moving closer to Miranda and farther from friends, family, and long time boyfriend. There is where the film flaws; it's too much like a recipe and less like an original blueprint to present with admiration. It's a Cinderella story with the same exact formula we've all seen before. The three standout performances are what keeps the story moving and provides us with care and pleasure.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci is truly an always dependable and reliable supporting player of film making. He is ""Nigel,"" Miranda's right hand man and Andy's gateway into fashion expertise. Nigel is funny, witty and hugely charismatic. Tucci is definitely the character you could care the most about and gives the most natural performance of the cast but doesn't have that Oscar scene. Tucci's character is a bit flat in some areas and underdeveloped. Nonetheless, gives great mannerisms, fantastic quotes and exquisite chemistry with any of his co-stars. A scene about the character's background or sexuality could have sealed the deal for a nomination and unless the academy is feeling compelled to reward, which I think they aren't just yet, he'll be sitting out of the ceremony. He has one more film this year, ""Four Last Songs"" which could revive and increase his buzz by year's end so we'll have just wait.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway is having a hell of time riding off some ""Brokeback Mountain"" love to land her some solid leading female roles. She is the true lead of the film but there's nothing that screams Oscar about the role, it's just a solid effort to show us that she can act and is ready to leave her cutesy ""Diaries"" girl behind. Andy is a highly enjoyable character to inhabit and completely likable. How can you not? She's completely vulnerable and completely lovable. Hathaway will probably be going for a Knightley-Portman kind of year and if ""Becoming Jane"" is something great than she could find herself as the breakout star of the year like Terrence Howard last year. Andy's flaws and chink in her armor is where Hathaway truly shines. From putting on her first fashionable outfit to finding herself being relentlessly pursued by a business acquaintance, Andy is defenseless to the active world of media and glamour which leads to her character's downfall and inevitable rise up.<br/><br/>And of course, who could forget the wonderful Meryl Streep. She is brilliant, bitchy, cruel, unkind and malicious. That's a lot for a character to expose and then suddenly surges into a character to mourn for, to feel for and feel completely sorry for. Streep is having a hell of year thus far and along with her ""A Prairie Home Companion"" buzz she will undoubtedly land in the top 5 of the supporting category. Her Miranda is clearly a supporting role and it boggles my mind how people thought otherwise. This will hopefully be the year that Ms. Meryl will land her 14th and record breaking nomination but will most likely be for ""Prairie"" and not ""Prada."" Her Yolanda is more Oscar bait and up Oscar's alley. Miranda has a lot to offer to cinema but not enough to go down in the books.<br/><br/>The film has the a+b part of the equation but I was expecting a more capitalized ""C"" and got the anticipated ""c."" The film starts to build the gigantic climax and just leaves us somewhere between premise and resolution. Even though disappointing in some aspects, the film is quite enjoyable and you could get a few laughs but don't expect miracles to happen and new ideas to be made. The rest of the supporting cast is good with some showing some range and some just showing. Emily Blunt is a great character to look and watch as the first assistant to Miranda. Enjoy the film and expect some Globe consideration and nominations but don't hold your breath to her a ""Prada"" name or nom be called out on Oscar morning. It's all too cliché.<br/><br/>Grade: **1/2/****"

Especially in the case of the brilliant Meryl Streep, who here proves she can be a convincing evil witch and yet hold our attention for her rare vulnerable moments. This is a piece of powerful characterization.<br/><br/>The story is both well known because of Lauren Weisberger's Top 10 on the charts novel and because the story of a plain Jane making it big in the corporate world at the risk of jeopardizing her ideals and private life. But the story works again, this time draped in the fashion magazine industry.<br/><br/>Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a reporter without a job, a girl simple and physically unsophisticated with a chef boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) and extended family, who is placed for interview with Runway Magazine as the personal assistant to the editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). And is dowdy but smart, and Miranda decides to take her one despite her other assistant Emily (Emily Blunt) and jeering crowd's amazement. Miranda is a Diva who is a control freak, spits out demands as she tosses her wrap and purse on the assistant's desk, communicates only is stingingly acidic one liners, and is in general a fearsome Titanic of a woman. The story revolves around Andy's transformation by magazine worker Nigel (Stanley Tucci) et al and within weeks Andy is Miranda's right hand person, responsible to her whims 24/7. This obligation and change wrecks havoc with Andy's personal life, leads to a Paris fashion trip, an encounter with Christian Thompson (Simon Baker),a hunky writer with high credentials when sets out to woo Andy, and eventually Andy must make some choices about the speedy treadmill on which she finds herself.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a bit of Working Girl, Cinderella, etc but it works on screen due largely to the fine performances by the entire cast - but especially for the stunning tour de force by Streep. Clothed in an endless array of fashionable outfits, Streep is the epitome of the fashion guru: she hasn't looked this beautiful in a long time and this film reminds us that she is a very attractive as well as inordinately gifted actress. This role is so well played that it may even be listed in the Oscar category. Now who would have ever expected that from the rather silly idea of The Devil Wears Prada? Strong work! Grady Harp"

"Tony43","Null","1","2","15 July 2006"," Mary Tyler Moore for the new millennium
","I reluctantly went to see this film, but came away very glad I did. While in many ways very much the ""chic flick, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is more than just a pretty picture.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple. Andy, a recent college graduate, manages to land a dream job as number two assistant to the editor of the top women's fashion magazine in the country. Andy, played smoothly and appealingly by Anne Hathaway, is smart, resourceful and has a kind of quiet self confidence that allows her to be good at her job, even for the most part brushing aside the highly negative comments from her coworkers, most of which center around the fact that she does not dress up to their standards. But with the help of a mentor, art director Stanley Tucci, she is able to tap into all the free clothes left around there after photo shoots and winds up looking like she stepped out of Vogue every time she steps out of the house. (Okay, that does stretch things a little, as obviously the clothes would be recognized by the other girls, who would probably whine about why they didn't get the same treatment.) The big conflict here? Andy's boss makes Mary Tyler Moore's Mister Grant look like Mother Teresa. Miranda Priestly, played by Meryl Streep, is truly the boss from hell. She is the kind of officer who gets fragged by his own men on the battlefield. But, to the film's credit, she is also portrayed as smart, exceptionally good at what she does, and a person quickly able to spot a phony a mile away.<br/><br/>Streep gives an Academy Award winning performance here and no doubt will get a nomination. Her work is exceptional, when you consider that in her other big hit of the year, ""A Prairie Home Companion,"" she plays a small time country western singer and pulls that role off with equal success.<br/><br/>**************spoiler alert**************** <br/><br/>While the film does in fact feature lots of nifty clothes for the women to ogle, it does go more than skin deep,for Andy slowly but surely finds herself sacrificing her life to this 24-7 job she has taken on, eventually losing her live in boyfriend and most of her friends, too.<br/><br/>And in the film's most controversial twist, she decides in the end, after watching Miranda lose her third husband in a row, that the job just isn't worth it. So, Andy symbolically throws her cell phone into a fountain and walks out -- on the limousines, the trips to Paris, the potentially big salary and the chance to rub shoulders with the rich, the famous and the well dressed.<br/><br/>Would this happen in real life? Maybe, but probably not. And when Meryl Streep whines that if she were a man, nobody would complain about the long hours she works, she may be mouthing feminist rhetoric, but not being truthful. The fact is, lots of wives complain about the very same thing, when their husbands are the ones who are never home or always missing the kids birthday parties. The fact is, people of both genders sacrifice their personal lives to achieve success in their careers.<br/><br/>Perhaps the biggest lesson of the film is found in Stanley Tucci's character, who is promised a major job with a new concern, only to be screwed over in the end because of Miranda's need to maneuver a rival into that job to protect her own position at the magazine.<br/><br/>That is probably the real lesson of this film. Even if you are very good at your job and even if you do work 24-7 and sacrifice everything for your career, there is no guarantee that some superior will not screw you over, because of his or her personal agenda or maybe do it just on a whim.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all the pretty clothes and glamour of this film may conceal that important part of the message."
"amrinder_arora","8","1","2","11 July 2006"," Simple and Subtle - Good fun!
","Set in the glitter world of fashion, ""Devil Wears Prada"" reaches the level of simplicity and complexity that is highly desirable, but uncommon in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Andrea Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway) is a journalism graduate who comes to NYC for a journalism job but ends up as the second assistant to Miranda Priestley (played by Meryl Streep), the chief editor of top fashion magazine ""Runway"".<br/><br/>While people all around her tell her that the position is one that 'a million girls would kill for', Andrea (Andy) is less impressed and considers it merely her temp job for a year (""to the jobs that pay the rent""). Her upbringing and ethics have her convinced that fashion is a trivial activity, that should matter very little in life. Subtle changes in her thinking as she progresses in the fashion world and the first ""all consuming"" job that fresh graduates typically experience are the highlights of the movie. [""..better you do at work, more your personal life suffers.. When your personal life is completely blown away, know that you are due for a promotion.."" -- Nigel (played by Stanley Tucci)]<br/><br/>The movie is refreshingly simple and does not fall for the ""love triangle caused by confusion"" or the ""loving mom, terrible boss"" traps. It stays close to its theme, and does so in a light, fun manner. Still under its deceptive simplicity lie nuances of complexity. During a conversation between Andy and Miranda, when driving to the premier fashion event in Paris, Miranda points out that though they may appear to be very different from each other, Andy is just a younger reflection of herself. This lighter touch manifestation of Narcissus and Goldmund is a highlight of the movie. Through a subtle touch of Andy's seduction by a writer, the duality of good in bad and bad in good is highlighted in passing. A very brief scene of the New York Mirror office at the end (where fashion indeed does not matter), highlights the issue of ""my perspective is my universe (and rightly so)"".<br/><br/>This may be a sleeper hit of 2006, and may get a nomination for best supporting actress for Meryl Streep."
"Alfriend","Null","1","2","11 July 2006"," Is it a comedy or something else?
","The film starts out like the typical comedy you expect from the trailers and teasers and slowly becomes somewhat more unnerving. Hopefully most of us don't work for someone as awful as Meryl Streep's character, but these days there seems to be a lot of ringing truth in the cow-towing that goes on in the work-place along with the excessive hours that come quite close to home. Was it intentional? Is it because Meryl Streep is so good that he becomes all to real? Hard to say. I do feel that the script feels like it was written by committee with different writers adding their own style and take so in the end we have a film that is a comedy, a drama and doesn't move well between the two. There's little resolution to the story and by the time we see the two leads meeting one another on the street at the end, you really don't care nor do you feel like the Streep character is even worth acknowledging. She is cold, mercenary and down-right apathetic in the worst way. Who'd want to acknowledge her for anything other than seeing the back of her.<br/><br/>The acting is the only thing that makes the film worth watching. Streep is excellent and so is Anne Hathaway who has not gotten her due in this film from most critics. Stanley Tucci always terrific does a great turn and even in a small role Adrien Grenier charismatically holds the screen quite well. Were it not for the actors, I'd have given the film a 1 rating."
"Chris Knipp","8","1","2","9 July 2006"," Silk purse from sow's ear
","Lauren Weisberger's eponymous tome was a thinly-veiled memoir of her brief stint as personal assistant to ice queen Vogue Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour. It wasn't the style or the storytelling that made the book a six-month Times bestseller item. After about the fifth trip to Starbucks schlepping coffee back to the fashion maven on excruciating four-inch heels, Weisberger's writing begins to get on your nerves. You're fascinated that a young woman would put up with such torture to make it in magazines or that any fashion world boss-lady could be so spoiled and mean, but the narrative is clumsy and repetitive.<br/><br/>That the movie sparkles is due to several things. Well, why shouldn't it? This is the world of high fashion. The pressure, the waste, the arbitrariness, are breathtaking -- but so, you have to admit, are the beauty, the elegance, and the glamor of this world. Aline Brosh McKenna worked wonders with the book, paring it down and introducing more of a sense of progression in her screenplay. The director, ""Entourage"" and ""Sex and the City"" alumnus David Frankel, and his team have made excellent choices, starting by casting Meryl Streep as piranha Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly and Stanley Tucci as Nigel, her fashion editor.<br/><br/>It's hard to say if one would want to watch the movie without Streep -- certainly not as much; but who cares? Steely, cruel, elegant, icy, and just a tiny bit pathetic, she's a wicked delight and a huge welcome relief from such Streep frumpery as Madison County, The Hours, Lemony Snicket, or Prairie Home Companion. Who knew she had so much delightful meanness in her? This is Streep with a whole new edge. But Meryl is a great actress, so there's balance to the extreme. The brief scene near the end where she tells Andy (Anne Hathaway, the author's character, Andy Sachs) that her husband is divorcing her is a quiet marvel. For a few minutes we look into this opaque creature and discover a human being who's caring and hurt. Tucci's Nigel is similarly nuanced, not the tacky, camp creature of the book but again a subtle, modulated portrait of a gay man who's got a lot of class. And yet this is all comedy and grotesque, because the world of fashion and above all Miranda Priestly's end of it are so awesomely, absurdly over-the-top.<br/><br/>And it's a lark from scene one, because Andy walks in for her interview as an eager young journalist out of college, but one who's never even heard of this Miranda Priestly lady, and who doesn't really want to write for Runway (the Vogue stand-in). Andy has big eyes and a wide mouth and she's pretty and she's not fat but she's a fashion idiot. She doesn't know who designed the clothes she's wearing, and she soon wishes the people in the office didn't either. She gets looked over from top to toe every time she turns around, and none of them like what they see. But she gets the job because Miranda is sick of sycophants. Not that she doesn't expect and demand that Andy will obey her every whim, and right this instant now, and ""that's all"" (which is how her commands all end, not with a ""please"" or a ""thank you"").<br/><br/>Streep is effective because she is never, ever shrill. She speaks always in a calm, low, modulated voice. ""I cannot understand what you find so difficult about the instructions I have given, which were perfectly clear."" That kind of thing. It's like the Red Queen in Alice in Wonderland, it's crazy and it's autocratic -- Miranda is the supreme ruler of her considerable domain -- but we know that Andy is doing this only for a year, for the experience and for the line on her CV; she's not trapped in this world. And there are tiny, tiny signs that Miranda is favorably impressed by Andy's performance, despite the absolute absence of thank-you's or words of praise.<br/><br/>What also makes the movie work well is that fashion is about the way things look, and this is a pretty film, much meaner than Funny Face but as visually appealing. Lauren Weisberger is free with names, but she never makes us quite see the svelte ""clackers"" who hover around, or the exaggerated, hugely expensive clothes -- above all she can't show us how Nigel and staff dress Andy up to be seen with her boss. In the movie the sleek transformation unfolds breathtakingly before our eyes.<br/><br/>Absent from the movie is most of the book's meanness and hatred and bad language and Andy's nightmare drunken roommate. A lot of the grouchiness is absorbed into personal assistant number one, Emily (the able Emily Blunt, Tamsin in the dreamy My Summer of Love), who also takes the bump from a car the roommate gets in the book, but emerges less scathed.<br/><br/>Andy's suffering ghetto schoolteacher boyfriend Nate becomes an aspiring sous-chef played by spaniel-eyed cutie Adrien Grenier of ""Entourage"" whose biggest problem is achieving a killer port wine reduction. Andy's a central character in the movie but not the narrator and we're not stuck inside her head. The movie still has a little posse of underdeveloped friends, though, including a black woman photographer who has a big show, whom we never quite understand or see the point of. Luckily, the focus is always chiefly on queen bee Miranda with her vague commands and clear threats, and Andy trying to keep up, never quite succeeding, but still surviving beyond anyone's wildest expectations, so that before the end when Miranda tells Andy in the limo in Paris during the big fashion week, ""You remind me of myself when I was your age,"" we're startled but not entirely surprised. This is the paradox that sustains the story: Andy hates Miranda, but she wants to please her. She hates this world, but it dazzles her. We leave the movie with somewhat the same feeling."

","Make no mistake, Anne Hathaway may be the nominal star of this film, but Meryl Streep is the reason to see it. She is incredible as Miranda Priestly, the hard driving, cold editor of Runway Magazine.<br/><br/>The plot is very thin here: Andy Sachs (Hathaway), a recent college grad, gets a job she believes is beneath her as an assistant to Miranda Priestly (Streep) at Runway Magazine. This job is supposed to open doors at nearly every other magazine in the business, should Andy last a year. It turns out though that Priestly has a reputation as a dragon lady, and her constant demands make Sachs crazy. However, Andy eventually rises to the occasion, begins to take the job seriously and it seems she is well on her way to being a success. As she does this, she eventually alienates herself from her friends and boyfriend, as they tell her she has changed. Andy is then forced to choose between her job and her personal life. You can guess what she chooses.<br/><br/>Despite this, Meryl Streep is outstanding. She makes her character sympathetic, and there are times you root for her over Andy. Stanley Tucci is also a standout as Nigel, who seems to be a fashion editor at Runway. The weakness of this movie is really Andy and her friends. At the beginning of the movie Andy comes off as something of a snob. She seems to think that she is better than her job and the people she works with. If anything, we see Andy grow to become a better person because of the job, even if the activities she has to do are mundane. Her friends are an even bigger problem. They are given no real development, and spend most of their time whining that Andy isn't paying them more attention. The biggest problem though is Andy's boyfriend. He is given nothing to do except complain to Andy about her job. We are given no real reason as to why Andy should choose him over her job, except that he seems nice.<br/><br/>Overall though, the movie is great fluff. You won't learn much by watching it, but it is fun to see."

"cwx","6","1","2","6 July 2006"," Good, but unsound
","This is one of those movies that seems solid and entertaining, then starts to crumble a bit when you think about it afterwards; however, it still holds up for the most part, and the main purpose of a movie is to keep you interested while you're watching, after all. The first problem is the title, which also implies that Meryl Streep is the main role, rather than protagonist Anne Hathaway who is, in fact, effectively plays an interesting character rather than just a sounding board for another virtuoso Streep performance (which isn't to say that Streep isn't good, either).<br/><br/>The main problems mostly lie in how Andy, Hathaway's character, deals with her dilemma; should she stay true to herself or fall into the fashion world? This isn't as lame as it sounds on paper, especially since they managed to convey some sense of the aforementioned fashion world's glamour to someone like me who by default reviles every aspect of it. This, however, might mean that I sympathized more with her plight than someone who, say, never had any qualms about ""fitting in"" at all costs. However, the weakness of the detractors seems to sap this film's moral clarity, as does its eventual mutation from a series of critiques of a whole industry to a mere interpersonal conflict; of course this is inevitable in Hollywood film, but the way this happens in this movie decidedly muddies up and changes the entire issue at hand. Of course, a film like this wants to have it both ways, but one hopes at the very least that when several characters describe a size 4 as ""fat,"" the filmmaker means to attack that perspective. A lack of clarity on this issue is a lot more unforgivable. All that said, I did find it to be compelling and well-played."

Anne Hathaway was the archetypal doe-eyed princess, again, but she pulled off Andrea's transformation capably and seemed to have fun in the role.<br/><br/>While the author of the novel upon which the film is based, Lauren Weisberger (a former assistant to legendary Vogue editor Anna Wintour), insists she didn't draw on her experience at Wintour's Jimmy Choo-clad feet for inspiration, she obviously saw the fashion publishing and haute couture world for what those of us who do not own $1,900 handbags believe it to be: very serious about something that's really very silly. But the moral of the story -- be true to your self, don't sell out to The Man (who is, surprise-surprise, a Woman this time), etc.<br/><br/>I'll say one thing for this film. It never got smarmy, and had a number of chances to go Hollywood that it didn't cash in on. Hoorah! Also, the clothes were Divine, but all those stilts (heels)? Eeks!

"cultfilmfan","10","1","2","6 July 2006"," The Devil Wears Prada
","The Devil Wears Prada is based upon the novel of the same name by Lauren Weisberger. The film is about a young woman named Andy Sachs who gets a job at a fashion magazine as an assistant to the magazine's editor named Miranda Priestly. Andy finds out that working for Miranda is no easy task having to answer and take calls from Miranda all day and do several errands for her without ever being thanked or told that she is doing a good job. Miranda is a very tough boss and enough to make some people go crazy. A co-worker at the magazine named Nigel starts to get friendly with Andy and gives her a whole new wardrobe seeing as everyone who works at the magazine is fashion obsessed and Andy's previous clothes were bringing her ridicule. Andy's family and friends are soon realizing that Andy is spending all of her free time doing things for her job and that she is neglecting them and herself. Eventually, Andy will have to make a decision on whether to stick to a job that millions of young women would kill for or continue to work for a woman like Miranda and continue ignoring her family and friends. The Devil Wears Prada has good direction, a good adapted screenplay, great performances by the main cast members and a good supporting cast as well, good film editing and good costume design. The Devil Wears Prada is probably a movie that more women will see than men, but in the long run I really liked this film. The acting is great and Meryl Streep who plays Miranda will undoubtedly get an Oscar nomination for Best Actress and Stanley Tucci who plays Nigel will likely get a Best Supporting Actor nomination as well. Meryl Streep uses her face, movements and body language to play this character and she does a great job of it. The film is also very entertaining and has a very sharp and well written script. There are a lot of intellect inside jokes in this movie and some of the dialog between the magazine co-workers is sassy and smartly written. The film is compelling and in a lot of ways this is a very pleasant film with a likable young woman who has to decide about her future and her family and friends at the same time. This movie entertained me and kept my interest and it has a well polished directing job and great performances that will not go unnoticed come awards time, so basically in every way this movie is a hit. And even though this movie looks like a mere chick flick I think it would be a really good date movie and that guys will enjoy the film and the acting as well. The Devil Wears Prada is one of the first great comedies of the year and starts off the summer as one of the best film's so far this year. A huge success of a film."

The part that she plays here is very easygoing and sophisticated. The results are mind-blowing in every aspect! I was very impressed with what this movie depicted! <br/><br/>From beginning to end, The Devil Wears Prada will keep you mesmerized. The story of a visionary and sympathetic young lady coming to work for a selfish and unpredictable publication editor has its moments of comedy, drama, and, of course, style. Miranda Priestly is immensely straightforward, direct and serious about her position of editor-in-chief for Runway Magazine. She expects her subordinates to be creative, infallible, dedicated, and independent. Therefore, Miranda is like a powerful monarch in the city of New York. Andrea Sachs, the other lead character, has tremendous persistence and is very sweet-natured and generous to all of her close companions and relatives. Andrea is forced to obey every fierce command that Miranda bestows upon her. The nature of Miranda really stresses Andrea out and it is not long before her personal life is greatly affected. As a result, she is faced with the confusion of what to do in order to put an end to all of the pressure and mayhem.<br/><br/>The entire picture here is very overwhelming and the principal cast members all shine like bright stars.

The Devil wears Prada has comedic, dramatic, and emotional elements all wrapped up in it. It's not just a movie where the mean horrible boss is rude and hateful to her employees. Meryl Streep is brilliant (once again), in the role of Miranda Priestly. She pulls off the Catty, Sarcastic, even Mean personality of the character without a hitch, making those traits seem like they are first nature to her. But she also has a human-ness about her. She is a mother and a wife, not just a magazine editor. I couldn't help but feel sorry for her in the scene where she opens up to Andy about her divorce.

The key to any movie like this is: ""Know what you're getting."" <br/><br/>Meryl Streep of course gets all of the praise for this film, and indeed she is a riot. She resists the temptation to play the role of Miranda Priestley as a gross caricature, and instead decides to play her as a real person, which gives the movie dimensions it wouldn't have had otherwise. The character of Miranda would have been too unbearable to be fun if someone else had played her, but Streep knows how to deliver a nasty line while letting us know she's in on the joke, and her character is by far the best thing about the movie.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci, that unsung character actor, is also terrific as Nigel, Anne Hathaway's Henry Higgins.

"abajoue","8","1","2","4 July 2006"," Devilishly good fun! Meryl Streep shines.
","I was much more entertained by the TDWP than I expected to be. The movie took the best parts of the book, humanized the characters, and made them more 3-dimensional than they were on paper. Meryl Streep demonstrates once again why she is one of the ""grandes dames"" of celluloid, in a pitch-perfect portrayal of Miranda Priestley. Although Streep consistently maintains Miranda's hard edge and bitingly-comedic sarcasm throughout the movie, she also gives us glimpses into the woman behind the mask without watering-down the character the audience loves to hate. I was really pleased to see that the end of the movie refused to insult the audience's intelligence by having Miranda see the ""error of her ways"" and undergo a complete (and unrealistic) character transformation. Rather, she maintains her devilish charm while being wise enough to recognize--and respect--the differences between herself and her 2nd assistant, Andy.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway does a really good job in TDWP, and holds her own in her scenes with Streep--no easy task, since pretty much everyone looks like an amateur next to Meryl. While Anne fittingly brings a bit of that wide-eyed innocence to the role of Andy (which made her a pre-teen sensation in the ""Princess Diaries"" and the like), it does not completely define her character. It was great to see Hathaway push the envelope a bit, and to show the tension between that innocence and the cutthroat sink-or-swim world of high-fashion publishing.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast also does an admirable job. Stanley Tucci is a gem as Miranda's long-suffering sidekick, Nigel, and Emily Blunt shows why she's a young face to watch in Hollywood. And, of course, you've got to love Simon Baker as the incurable, impossibly-handsome rake, Christian Thompson. He is the ultimate guilty pleasure in this movie; the guy you know is no good for Andy, but who is so disarmingly charming that you want to see them hook up anyway. I was not the only woman in the movie theater hoping that Andy would dump her boyfriend Nate and get together with Christian! (No small feat, since Adrian Grenier is pretty easy on the eyes as well).<br/><br/>The only reason I took 2 stars off this movie was the forced ""reconcilation"" between Andy and Nate. He had no qualms about moving to Boston to chase his dream of becoming a chef, and I don't think that Andy had any reason to be apologetic about pursuing her career goals just as fervently, whether at Runway magazine or elsewhere. To be quite honest, Nate seemed more like a whiner and an impediment than a supportive boyfriend you would want Andy to get back together with. But this is the only minor pet-peeve I have about this film. Otherwise, TDWP was a great movie that I actually enjoyed even more than the book (for a change!), and will definitely be picking up when it's released on video. Watching Meryl Streep do what she does best is worth the price of admission alone."

","Who can resist a movie starring Meryl Streep? I couldn't, even though my idea of fashion is wearing silver bracelets with my overalls. And then there is relatively newcomer Anne Hathaway. I just wanted to see how they would chem together. It worked. But--we have seen Ann in too many of these makeover/change of character movies. She did the princess makeover thing in both Princess Diaries and in Enchanted Ella. She has obvious talent and needs to find a movie where she is stretching herself, like Meryl. Meryl cannot be typecast since she has the ability to make the role hers. She becomes whatever the part calls for. She is amazing.<br/><br/>As for the movie... If you are looking for an outsider's peek at the fashion world, and a fairly predicable plot, I would then say go watch The Devil wears Prada. But go for Meryl even if you don't like fashion. And be ready for Meryl's name to come up at Oscar time.."

","The cinematography is beautiful both of The City and the fashions. Manhattan hasn't been so lovingly displayed since Woody Allen.<br/><br/>Meryle Streep turns Miranda Priestly into a three-dimensioned and complex character, not the flat evil persona of the original novel. Streep has never looked more elegant with small waist and arched back. She gets some inspired lines of dialog. It's hard to believe this is the same woman who played a frumpy housewife 11 years ago in Bridges of Madison County. Miranda Priestly will become a classic character of the cinema like Cruella de Ville long after the movie.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway plays Andy Sachs, the bright and eager journalism-school graduate in preppy sweaters skirts who wants to be a journalist, but takes a coveted assistant's job fetching Starbucks to her icon boss, whom she hadn't even known before the interview. That's the easy part of the job, balancing four grandes in a cardboard holder. To Andy falls several Herculean tasks as well. Hathaway's conversational style, wardrobe and body language changes, but she tries to be in that rarefied fashion world, not part of it. Occasionally Miranda lets her know she is pleased, but Andy loses her personal friends, who don't see the distinction. (She's already experienced indulging the whims of her self-absorbed boyfriend who sulks if he feels he's not getting enough attention. Miranda is only a few notches above him.) In the end Andy has to decide whether she is willing to let herself be absorbed by a way of life that sacrifices people for the cause of art and ambition.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci as Nigel, one of Miranda's deputies, is serves as a mentor to Andy. Adrian Grenier,Simon Baker, and Daniel Sunjata are some very eye-catching hunks in contrast to the estrogenic environment."

"Surecure","7","1","2","4 July 2006"," A well thought out comedy that has something for everyone
","My girlfriend was dying to see 'the Devil Wears Prada' after having seen previews and read the book upon which the film is based. I was curious about the film after seeing the previews, and having a great deal of respect for Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway, I thought that it would at least have some strong performances.<br/><br/>'The Devil Wears Prada' is a very enjoyable film with a well developed script and fine performances all around. While it is obviously marketed as a typical ""chick-flick"", it sets itself apart from the crowd by being a biting, dark comedy about the boss-from-hell that anybody can relate to. In that, even your average guy -- like me -- will be more than amused by the setup and scenarios as they play out.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep proves yet again that she is a force to be reckoned with who can turn any part into something wonderfully memorable. Her portrayal of a fashion magazine editor who chews her assistants up and spits them out before lunch is fantastic to watch. Her performance is certainly not based on dialog, as her discussions on the nature of fashion and her complete lack of regard for anything that doesn't fit into her schedule does not provide any real depth in words. The strength in her performance is in the delivery, and she more than proves why she is oft considered the greatest living actress.<br/><br/>While Stanley Tucci and Anne Hathaway both provide excellent performances, the real standout amongst the rest of the cast has to be Emily Blunt who portrays a brown-nosing, self-absorbed assistant who supplies a great deal of the more memorable moments of the film. Her principle position in the film is of consistently standing in the way of Anne Hathaway's character, only to have the tables turned in hilarious fashions, and in this she simply shines. Her comedic timing is impeccable and she certainly proves that she is easily of the same caliber as the principle cast members.<br/><br/>In the end, the film does end up wrapping itself up a little too easily and provides a somewhat disappointing Hollywood style ending. But, obviously the film was designed for a certain audience so it cannot be faulted for attempting to match the expectations of those who would pay for a ticket. Even then, 'the Devil Wears Prada' is a fun, light-hearted and well crafted film that could easily be enjoyed by just about anybody."

I'm a New Yorker, I've had jobs with ""the boss from hell"" more than once, and I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! And, I shall add that Simon Baker is nice and easy on the eyes. This is a movie I could enjoy again and again--simply wonderful performances by everyone!!! SUPERB PERFORMANCES BY ALL!!! APPLAUSE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK!!

","The Devil Wears Prada tells the story of Andy, a young reporter who lands a dream job working for Miranda at Runway, the best fashion magazine in New York. Although it is said numerous times in the movie ""a million girls would kill for this job,"" Andy is not sure that she wants it. Here lies the first flaw of many thorough the movie. We are never told how Andy, a girl with no fashion sense whatsoever has been pushed to the top of the pile of candidates for the job. Yet we have to accept this and an expected turn of events if we are to make since out of the rest of the movie. The story is so cookie cutter that an audience could probably quote the characters along with the movie having never seen it before. Prada is also filled with outrageous coincidences in order to keep the story moving. (At least 4 in one span of 5 minutes) But a predictable story line does not always make for a bad movie. This movie is worth seeing for two reasons: the cloths and Meryl Streep.<br/><br/>This movie is a fashion designers dream come true. If you love fashion, clothing, shopping, are a girl, or like to wear any cloths at all in public then this movie's wardrobe is a feast for the eyes. Anne Hathaway changes costumes like Amadala from Star Wars in this movie except she manages to make each and every outfit look more stunning than the last. Plus there is a scene where Andy walks into a massive closet stocked full of designer cloths that will make teenage girls squeal with joy.<br/><br/>My personal favorite reason that I recommend this movie however is the performance given by Meryl Streep. Here portrayal of the ice queen of fashion is worth 4 of the 6 stars that I gave to this movie. If you don't get to this one in theaters then at least rent it to see Streep in all of here glory. You're in for a treat."

","Here is the best compliment you might want to pay a movie: I want to see it again and again. Here is one of this summer's true guilty pleasures, a film that showcases an amazing, incandescent, and scathing turn by Ms. Meryl Streep. She should be recognized as the best this year has to offer. Her editor from hell has to be one of the best female performances of the last fifty year, a role that is funny, scary, intelligent, and delivered by impeccable comedic timing by one of our greatest living actresses.<br/><br/>The film glides, with no dead time, in a little less than two hours. For most of the time, we are given insight into a world that would have been perfect as one Darwin's studies and more than proves his theories: only the strong will survive. Hathaway might lack some of the experience that Streep has, but her performance is almost flawless. She is the innocent that learns to deal with impossible odds and looks good doing it.<br/><br/>This is a sharp script that demonstrates that a good screenplay can throw sparks when it's written with knowledge, skill, and care, and in the hands of actors like Streep, Tucci, and Hathaway, it can even catch fire. I could go on lavishing praises on Streep's perfection; let it suffice to say that a movie with a cold adversary, able to to turn humans to mush with a single look or a venomous phrase is much more enjoyable than any mythical rehash that pretends to have a heart, or gasp! worse, save the world when the hero in question can't even show a soul who he really is or wants.<br/><br/>It's time to see why original material can makes us cheer and run back to the multiplex and I'd rather have a battle of the wits than a battle of the witless."

It was the dry humor of the movie that I loved. Meryl Streep and Anne Hathaway are outstanding and made the movie totally believable. The thing I really liked about this movie was that while I hated her I loved Meryl Streep's character and I wanted Anne Hathaway to ditch her boyfriend and friends and follow her footsteps. I think it was still a chick flick but a tolerable one and even though you could probably guess the ending within 20 minutes it was all bearable and great to watch 'til the outcome (adding a few twists and turns that I didn't see coming).

","High fashion is sort of like art and religion--it is a con game but as long as you believe in it strongly enough you make it valuable and you're part of the club. This is the best sort of business plan since the seller decides what is important and the buyer accepts that. But there's nothing wrong with this in the business world and this film does a grand job of showing us how a powerful person runs the joint she works in and how she manipulates everyone in her world and how she is able to anticipate attacks and survive them. Miranda is mean but also admirable. Her power is administered ruthlessly but calmly and let's face it, it's a delight to watch it happen. This is a wonderful film to watch."

"TruthSpeaks","7","2","9","1 July 2006"," Worth seeing if you like this kind of movie
","The Devil Wears Prada is a good movie and worth seeing. There are things I wish they had done differently but the production values were very good, the picture was unusually sharp and clear, the soundtrack wasn't piercing, and it wasn't crude or misogynist. Adrian Grenier is in it. He has a supporting role but appears periodically throughout the movie. He plays the main character's loving, down to earth boyfriend. He has a three day growth of beard throughout and bushy eyebrows, but otherwise looks handsome. I'd say his acting ranges from very good to o.k.<br/><br/>The director is fascinated with Meryl Streep and her character; in fact it's a Meryl-centric production. I'm not as fascinated as he is; I would have liked to see more of Adrian and I don't think I'm alone. There were a lot of things that could have been done with regard to that. I mean, this is a chick flick. Instead this movie will go down in history as one of the most loving, detailed depictions of an aging ice queen ever made. The movie is almost trying to kiss Anna Wintour's and Vogue's but in a way. I didn't find that to be necessary.<br/><br/>There is plenty of fashion and many elegant settings. A lot of money was spent. The movie has also been very well promoted and supported, which is unusual for a ""chick flick"" these days. I'm glad of that. If the studios did a better job of catering to them, females and grown ups would come back to the theaters. I'm glad the people at this studio realize that. I look forward to seeing what they do next.<br/><br/>NOTE TO SENSITIVE PEOPLE AND PARENTS: There's nothing bad in this movie. It is rated PG-13 but it could even be rated PG or a G. There's less swearing than you will hear in line to get your tickets. There's no sex or nudity. You can tell some characters have had or will have sex but you really don't see anything of it at all. There's no violence. As I said earlier, the soundtrack was less noisy and obtrusive than usual and I'm thankful for that.<br/><br/>NOTE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MOVIES AND REAL LIFE: In this movie, and a lot of movies, there is a clear cut choice between doing something snotty and superficial and following a path with heart and integrity. A lot of teenage movies present this dilemma as well. My experience is that life hardly ever plays out that way.<br/><br/>I've written for magazines and am familiar with the publishing industry. First of all, to use this specific industry as an example, every day there are fewer publications to write for, of any type. The ones that remain are often getting eaten up by corporations and or having to downsize personnel, so even the idea of having a job at a publication is semi-mythical. Muckraking newspapers such as the one appearing in this movie are almost non-existent. People that work at alternative newspapers are often cranky, drug-addicted, and far from reasonable. Wages at such enterprises can be ridiculous and payment for freelance writers is often far less than minimum wage. Exploitation and mistreatment of writers is common at many publications, perhaps especially idealistic ones. <br/><br/>High fashion magazines have just as much to answer for. They cause anorexia and self-loathing in women, exploit hopeful young people, prostitute themselves to their advertisers, and recycle the same tired articles over and over again. For all that, your chance of ever getting a job at one of them is virtually non-existent.<br/><br/>Other industries have plenty of problems too. A business that espouses high ideals might have a bunch of maladjusted, difficult people running it and be a perfectly miserable place to work. Poverty sucks no matter how you slice it. You have a few years when you are young when it's o.k. but after that it grinds you down.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to tell anyone to lose their idealism, I just think that these movies collectively create a false picture of reality for young people. I can't tell you what to do, just don't go looking for the muckraking newspaper in this movie to apply for a job; it would have been shut down twenty years ago."
"belanger75","8","1","3","20 March 2019"," About the leading star in this film
","Meryl Streep looks like the only big name in this at the time in this during its making. Streep (in one of what three comedies she has done) looks nothing whatsoever like the highly voluptuous real-life, Well-known magazine editor Anna Wintour. Streep does not act much like Wintour either. But that is not wrong as this is only a highly fictional film somewhat just based on Wintour's life. But there was an actress who I believe is over 20 years older than the real Wintour, that is Lee Grant, that looks, sounds and acts just like the magazine editor herself. Grant may have been dead-on casting (save for tremendous age difference) to have been in this film rather than Streep. Grant is less attractive than Wintour though outside of that and the age difference their stamps for each otherwise Also, Grant never had Streep's star power so if one would not expect Grant to have been the star of this but still.<br/><br/>(I am only saying that Wintour is physically extremely attractive. She gets involved in bad left-wing causes and she doublecrossed her friend of decades (Trump) during the recent election and so on."

","The movie is based on a novel (2003) written by Lauren Weisberger which has been translated to more than 35 languages. <br/><br/>The Director David Frankel had read the novel and later thought of making it into a movie. There were several screenplay writers who worked to finalize the movie script, but the credit was ultimately given to Aline Brosch McKenna.<br/><br/>The movie is based on a real life true character the editor of Vogue Anna Wintour where Lauren had worked as an assistant for a short while. In the movie the role of real Anna is named Miranda (played villainously by Meryl Streep) and that of Lauren is named Andy (played by a new comer Anne Hathway).<br/><br/>The choice of Meryl was obvious but Anne had to push herself to get the role, but the new debut of Miranda's first secretary Emily played by Emily Blunt was after auditioning 1000 aspirants.<br/><br/>Meryl based her role and enacted it just imitating a brutal MAN running his company. <br/><br/>The story is about how Andy who wants to be a journalist gets sucked into the fashion industry through this magazine where she gets job as a secretary to Miranda, who is a brutal task master - one who is obnoxious and never satisfied.<br/><br/>The first secretary Emily aspires to be with Miranda, but with time Andy rises the ladder in the organization and does not realize that she is losing her love, her friends and her soul in the work she is doing.<br/><br/>When she realizes it she quits the job and joins a firm as a journalist and there the movie ends showing Andy liberated and happy.<br/><br/>The movie takes a shot at Fashion industry and takes a dubious view-point and presents it with enough guts to expose the underbelly of it.<br/><br/>So this time on my second viewing - I felt that - you take any industry - and when you work in it and climb the ladder - and if you are sucked into it defending it and living it - you will not be aware of the dirty underbelly of that industry. <br/><br/>But if one has to protect one's soul - one has to protect even if one works as a journalist - or even as a social worker or any other thing.<br/><br/>The moment your soul takes precedence - you will feel that the work you are doing does not fulfill your search and what you are seeking. <br/><br/>So to show the Fashion industry in bad light is a one-dimensional take. As much as fashion designers are superficial - so are journalist - so are any other professions. <br/><br/>So this was the take of mine - while watching the movie a second time.<br/><br/>The movie was a dud on USA box office but raked mullah on international release and became the biggest block-bluster internationally.<br/><br/>What happened actually was that people went gaga over the designer clothes worn in the movie rather than taking the message home.<br/><br/>I think, in my first viewing there was so much of critical buzz, that one gets dragged in the flow of positive reviews. Now after 10 years, it is a right frame of mind from which one watches the movie and gives a balanced review.<br/><br/>Overall - it was a okay movie. I will go with 5.5 out of 10."

","It may be unfair to say this, but this would have been a much less entertaining movie without the marvelous Meryl Streep. Actually, one could say that of any movie she is in, as she so completely overwhelms most of what Hollywood has to throw at her. The same is true here, with the exception of Stanley Tucci, whose counterpoint to Streep is so effective it was repeated almost immediately in Julie and Julia. <br/><br/>It's no secret that Streep's character is based on Anna Wintour, the tyrannical editor of Vogue, but Meryl Streep's Miranda Priestly really reminds me very little of Wintour, a credit to Streep's ability to create effective characters even within the persona of someone as well-known and contemporary as Wintour.<br/><br/>The cast of the film is tremendously uneven. Streep and Tucci are the stalwart cornerstones, without whose truly inspired performances the film would disintegrate tragically into banality. Anne Hathaway, good as usual though still a lightweight compared to Streep and Tucci, is the nominal star of the film, but she is more often than not a foil for the dynamic duo. Emily Blunt, as a devoted fashionista, nevertheless looks a bit odd from time to time, including her first appearance in the film criticizing Hathaway's conservative attire while she herself sports a sort of post-apocalyptic Goth Judy Jetson garb. She seems strangely underutilized and stretched a bit thin at the same time here, but she is delightful nonetheless.<br/><br/>Then there are the boyfriends. Adrian Grenier is definitely fighting above his weight class, and it doesn't work. He does a creditable job of moving dialog along with Hathaway, but he has to work too hard to appear interesting, and fails miserably. As for Simon Baker's Christian Thompson, aside from the fact that he's a bit self-obsessed, there seems to be no reason why Andy would not choose him, handsome, suave, successful, well-connected, over the scruffy, dreary and ultimately insecure character presented by Grenier. <br/><br/>Despite all its shortcomings, however, the film is dazzlingly successful in portraying the cutthroat fashion empire presided over by the ruthless, Cruella DeVil-ish editor of ""Runway"" magazine. Some people put on music for background noise. I put on a movie. This movie has been my background noise dozens of times, and I still love having it on. I savor every word, every gesture from the truly magical Meryl Streep as, in my opinion, the greatest Bitch of all time.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is wonderful, and one can enjoy this movie simply by listening to it. There are plenty of delicious surprises too, like the minor appearance of Gisele BÃ¼ndchen, who just happens to be the richest (her net worth exceeds the rest of the cast combined, even if you throw in Anna Wintour) and most successful supermodel of all time, as Serena, a work-friend of Emily Blunt's character.<br/><br/>In the end, I'm not sure why, but I absolutely love this movie. I can watch it twice in a row and have done more than once. You may not become that attached to The Devil Wears Prada, but it should definitely be worth the investment of at least one serious watch."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","1","3","11 June 2009"," Glossy and entertaining, but a bit shallow!
","This is a glossy and mostly entertaining film, if a little shallow in terms of story and depth. However, there is a well-written script, that sometimes borders toward predictability, and nice camera-work, not to mention the fashionable costumes. The film's main merit is the performance of Meryl Streep, who rarely disappoints in anything she's in. Here she seems to be relishing the role of the hard-to-please Melinda Priestly. Anne Hathaway of Princess Diaries fame, is very charming and suitably dorky as Andrea Sachs, though I will say her clothes at the beginning of the film were hideous. There is also scene stealing support from Emily Blunt, who delights in making catty remarks throughout the film, and Stanley Tucci, who helps transform Andrea from her former self. One may question whether the film is too long, but it's very fast-paced, so I didn't have a problem with the length. The few criticisms I had with the Devil Wears Prada, is the predictability of the story, and sometimes the lack of depth. Overall, an 8/10 Bethany Cox."

","Wide-eyed college graduate in NYC, a journalism major who dresses in old-lady skirts and lumpy sweaters, applies for a second assistant's job at the leading fashion magazine, Runway; she (improbably) gets the position, but soon finds working for the editor-in-chief, a notorious dragon lady, to be taking a toll on the rest of her life. Lauren Weisberger's novel becomes super-slick, chic and commercial take on the modern working woman's woes. Whether or not is mirrors reality (or, indeed, any actual person's day-to-day life in the Big Apple) is up for conjecture, however the performances by Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep are first-rate (Stanley Tucci is also excellent, and nicely not-flaming, as a fashion consultant).

","Miranda is a really tough personality. When I watched the film; I did not feel any anger for her, I just felt that she was a loser in the end of her life. She was angry at Andy because Andy did not choose the career path of Miranda but at the same time Miranda was somehow proud of Andy because of her courage of not following her. Miranda is really a complex character but she saw herself in Andy but she ignored Andy's own personality. When Miranda said to Andy ""I saw my adolescence in you"", the audience thought about Miranda once more. Was Miranda really a capricious, cruel and intolerable person? Or time and conditions made her like that? What is the cost of a shining life? The scene when Miranda was in bathrobe without any make-up was a symbol of Miranda's real personality without any mask. I really liked that film because I found myself questioning about people we don't really like."
"inspectors71","Null","1","3","27 March 2007"," Anne Hathaway Keeps Her Shirt On Through the Entire Movie!
","Apparently Anne Hathaway has made her bones by making Disney a small fortune, done a couple of edgy flicks wherein she bares her ample bosom (and gets fired by Disney), and has finally arrived with The Devil Wears Prada, a chic-flick powered by two good performances, those of Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>I don't understand the buzz about this movie--and you have to take that statement from a 48-year-old man living in a very red state with a grain of sea salt--but I know it's very popular. There's a whole lotta cliché-in' going on in TDWP, but Hathaway is an appealing and charismatic young woman who holds her own against Meryl Streep, doing the high-fashion diva act without breaking a sweat.<br/><br/>Streep is crisp and professional, so easily hate-able that you might miss two things she does that distinguish her performance. When Hathaway, new to the fashion industry, snickers at the imperceptible differences between a pair of blue belts, Streep verbally carves her up like a Christmas goose, and puts in a little bit about how Hathaway doesn't appreciate the thousands of jobs, the working-class paychecks the fashionistas create.<br/><br/>Later, when Streep is facing her umpteenth divorce, she appears rough, raw, without makeup, tearful and puffy. You expect her to reveal more, to let the audience see behind her armor, an actual human underneath the diva. But after a few unguarded moments with Hathaway looking helplessly on, she slips back into Imperious Bitch Mode.<br/><br/>She saves the scene from becoming maudlin by putting her armor back on. It's almost a dutiful suiting up, as if, if she didn't, she'd be betraying her obligation to kick the competition's collective ass.<br/><br/>It's as close to human as she gets until you see her in a tight close-up at the end of the film, when you understand that she knows who and what she is in the grand scheme.<br/><br/>Hathaway doesn't get to be that subtle. She is a beautiful woman, but her performance plays to Hathaway's strengths, nothing more or less. She gets to cry, laugh, get angry, and look good, but there's no stretch here. Putting pretty clothes on a pretty mannequin is not a big challenge.<br/><br/>Which brings us to Stanley Tucci, the wise homosexual who pounds Hathaway into professionalism with tough love. His character is as predictable as any other, but the last thing I saw Tucci in was the 1995 crime drama, Kiss of Death. He was reptilian and ambitious as a district attorney who betrays David Caruso. His balanced performance--neither too masculine or drag queen--is the best work in the movie and it took me twenty minutes to remember where I'd seen this guy before. <br/><br/>From my perspective, The Devil Wears Prada is a pleasant, if vacuous time-waster. There's nothing to be too cheerful about and nothing to get mad at. If the buzz sounds appealing, by all means rent it."

","This movie was surprisingly good. I say it was surprisingly good because it didn't follow the outline I thought it would. What I figured after about 10 minutes was:<br/><br/>Andrea (Anne Hathaway), after getting the job at Runway magazine, would infect everyone there with her moral uprightness. <br/><br/>Slowly, everyone (including Miranda) would become more grounded and less shallow. <br/><br/>Andrea would be tempted to do something completely out of character, but after coming close to committing hypocrisy or some mortal sin, she would have an epiphany and say ""no"" to whatever it was. <br/><br/>In the end Runway would be a better company and magazine all because they hired Andrea, hence Andrea and everyone else would live happily ever after.<br/><br/>I'm so glad that's not how it went. In fact, if anyone was affected by the other it was Andrea. Andrea got completely wrapped up in the fashion industry although her aspirations were to be a writer. That led to her alienating her friends and family and losing her boyfriend. Then, just a day after breaking up with her boyfriend, Andrea did the unthinkable: she slept with another man. And even though she didn't stay at Runway, Runway remained the same company after she left. Miranda (Meryll Streep) continued to be the same egotistical, self-centered, patronizing, condescending dragon-lady and life went on. Now, don't get me wrong, the movie ended a bit cliché. Andrea got a job at a newspaper and even though she didn't officially get back with her boyfriend, they made ammends.<br/><br/>I see why Meryll Streep was nominated for an Oscar for her role in this movie, she did a phenomenal job. At first you just hate her, then eventually you respect her. The movie had a few good laughs, but nothing to slap your knee about. The ending was fairly predictable, but as I mentioned earlier, it was hardly the cliché ending I expected. It was a solid movie."

","I'm not sure if the drive behind this film had a proclivity toward a different outcome than the decadent ending of a young and/or American idealist who believes she can ""Will"" more than getting out of bed, but if this was considered then I saw it on purpose, if it was not considered then it was an entertaining, accidental undercurrent, par excellence. Life cannot be ""Willed"" and upon acceptance, it can be different, fun, and/or tragic. If we don't accept it, it can also be different and tragic yet a moral bore. Table the mind numbing idea that the ""Will"" you use to succeed in small tasks has any association to what you think is a controlled and/or ""Willed"" destiny and you will feel much freer than the supporting actress makes you believe freedom to be. The scenery, lighting, story, and acting shown in the movie set it apart from others coming out of Hollywood.

"Clossius","8","1","3","26 November 2006"," reverse morals - entertaining movie
","Clearly an entertaining movie, with excellent New York and Paris shots, and some good actors. As Meryl Streep is without a doubt the greatest living movie actress, it goes without saying that she plays her part extremely well, although she is in the end under-challenged. What I would like to emphasize vis-à-vis the other comments is that in my opinion, the moral the film wants to present is not the one it does present: clearly, there is nothing wrong at all with the fashion industry (which indeed is a billion-dollar industry; to call it more frivolous than banking or politics is just social romanticism), nor with the way how Miranda manages her journal. If it's too hot for you, get out of the kitchen - and Andrea in the end does, but this is hardly a success; there is nothing better in being in ""hardcore"" journalism than what she was before. And tough jobs demand being away from your bf's birthday party; if he minds that, it is he who has a problem, not you. The movie also reminds all of us that we should dress better. :-)"

","My wife suggested we go and watch this and I was half encouraged because I thought it might be based on a Dennis Wheatley novel.However, to my disappointment it was all about a fashion house. I was so bored in the first 15 minutes had I been on my own I would have walked out. However, I stayed and I must say I enjoyed some of the one liners - it was slowly dawning on me it was meant to be a comedy (Most of the cinema audience were not laughing however). I think Meryl Streep glued it all together with her acting. I cant remember who the lead actress was and I don't care. All I can remember of her was that her bottom eyelids seemed to be stretched downwards like gravity was already working on them.The big screen made some of the scenes really breathtaking to look at but this will not translate to TV I don't think.

","I had some lag time yesterday, so I snuck over to the movie house to watch ""The Devil Wears Prada."" It must be its third week already here and the theater was not empty that afternoon, to its credit. It has some innovative camera-work. The opening sequence of Anne Hathaway and other girls preparing to go to work looked great. The sequence of Anne Hathway wearing all these different designer clothes while weaving in and out of pedestrian traffic on the way to her office was also very nicely shot. Using Anne Hathaway for this film made it feel like another Princess Diaries sequel at times, admittedly.<br/><br/>Meryl Streep, what can I say, another good performance, as usual. This character, she has done something like this before, hasn't she? It feels familiar...or have we simply watched her so many times?<br/><br/>Overall, not a waste of time. Obviously geared more for a female audience, who I am sure would love to have those dresses, bags and accessories for themselves."
"nycritic","9","1","3","19 July 2006"," Sympathy for the Devil
","It probably -- and most likely -- began as one of those tell-all books disguised as chick-lit that exposed ""the ugly, insensitive, cruel side of fashion."" After reading it last night, this was the impression I got, because as a story, it never goes anywhere. It's always on this never-ending one-note that is closer to THE DISCREET CHARM OF THE BOURGEOISIE in its nightmarish, surrealistic tone than a real story about the new assistant and her boss from hell. Instead that where the main character never getting to eat dinner, in the book, she never gets to have a life while she's involved in the hellish world of haute couture.<br/><br/>Not that there's anything wrong with writing tell-all books and then fictionalizing names, events, places, and the like. It's been done most notably by Christina Crawford after her Mother died and we know what kind of an exaggerated camp classic was borne out of that book. However, the great thing about film as a media of compressing and reshaping stories is that it can take the bare essence of a book's soul -- the characters that make the most impact -- and reconfigure them to a new story that while it bears little to no resemblance from its print version will greatly expound on the themes present there. Just look at what came out of a little-known story called ""The Birds,"" for example. And no one is complaining.<br/><br/>Gone from the movie is the excessively distorted tone that lingers within the pages of the novel. Such a move is best in order to tell a balanced story. In is the exploration of Miranda Priestly's character, who in the book was a complete caricature thought out of what seems to be the angry mind of an ex-employee, and here is shown to be have frightening depth of character and interestingly, a character that ignites the screen with her icy stares and perfect composure. Expanded from his original two over-the-top scenes is the character of Nigel who in the book was a shrieking muscle queen with a penchant for female attire (catsuit, anyone?) and speaking in capital letters. Here, he's presented as more subdued, closer to an emasculated auntie encased in Stanley Tucci's dapper persona, but no less essential to the story. And mercifully, chopped-up are sub-plots involving Andy Sachs' friends and family who in the book have their own lives and story lines and interfere a bit much with the whole story, and even then their presence could have been reduced a little more, but such is the case with having so many characters that do little to advance a plot -- or in some cases, as in Lily (in the book), force events.<br/><br/>In any case, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA is, as a movie (and using fashion lingo), nearly flawless despite such minor hang ups. Because it doesn't intend to tread risky ground in presenting an edgier story of Andy Sachs' rite of passage from frumpy wannabe reporter to an emotionally empty glamazon capable of hurting those around her with her total involvement in work (and thereby assuring her role as immediate successor to Miranda Priestly), it veers closer to the likes of FUNNY FACE. Even then, it's immensely enjoyable. Meryl Streep alone is the sole reason to watch the movie: whenever she is on screen, which is not enough, she simply ignites, especially in her character's orchestrated entrance into the movie -- one that is so pregnant in anticipation and tension that when she does open the doors to ""Runway"" and begins softly barking orders to a frazzled Emily Blunt, it almost comes as a relief of sheer pressure, even though she's only begun her reign of terror. She later has a scene where she succinctly cuts a snickering Hathaway down to size as she criticizes her ""cerulean"" misshapen sweater which is a way to show not only how that sweater came to her hands, but to have Hathaway show some respect to an apparently shallow world. If the intent was to make her a monster, the film succeeds: but the film's Miranda Priestly is different from the book. Streep's Priestly never overacts as much as she commands presence as well as sheer terror from anyone dumb enough to be within striking distance. Streep truly makes Miranda Priestly a snake (a reference to the book). Hers is the type that has accepted her role as such, has no intentions of backing down, and withholds a carefully hidden layer buried well underneath any prying eyes and only exposes itself at a crucial moment when her divorce becomes a reality. In short, she is empty on the outside, and tragically empty on the in.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway stars as Andy Sachs, and like every straight character, she has little to do but to react and follow suit. Because the actors who surround her -- Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci -- have stronger material to work with as they play people who have allowed the external take a stranglehold on their own identities and only rarely show glimpses of humanity (essentially, they are clones of their boss, but one complaint -- when will Hollywood have a gay character who has his own life and is not the sexless auntie who is every straight girl's best friend? Come on already.), they register more strongly. On the other hand, neither the book Andy nor the movie Andy evolve enough. Hathaway plays her straightforward, which is okay because this is what she is required to do as per the screenplay. Everyone else is fairly okay, but in essence, the movie is really the quartet of Hathaway, Blunt, Tucci, and overseeing them all, the magnificent Streep."

The crowd was guffawing for even the oldest sight gags, which I won't spoil here. As naturally lovely as Anne Hathaway is (even when dowdy), I really resent the casting of Adrian Grenier in his role as her love interest. He is just way too much the embodiement of the female idea of the metrosexual male ideal. It was grating, and took away from the believability - as did the size of their apartment. Stanley Tucci should be commended -- His first few lines have you thinking he'll be nothing but a walking stereotype (as was much of the aforementioned crowd I was sitting amongst)...but Tucci's character was well-written and well-executed. Meryl Streep was perfect, but I can't agree with the critic's suggestion to just have made a film about her character - you need the context of the Andy character. I noticed that the audience particularly loved the Emily character...she might ring the truest to life of all of the characters."

"jon.h.ochiai","10","1","4","4 August 2007"," Everybody wants to be us...
","I finally saw ""The Devil Wears Prada"". I kept bumping into it on HBO over the weekend, and what I saw looked good. So I finally just bought the DVD. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a great movie, and now among my all time favorites. When the movie came out last year, I had intended to see it, but never did. Although, I had read stellar reviews and heard great things, I could not find a comedy set in the high fashion world at all compelling. I was utterly wrong. It is the context more than the content that makes ""The Devil Wears Prada"" both hysterical and touchingly bitter sweet. Aline Brosh McKenna's screenplay based on Lauren Weisberger's novel is crisply written with deadly wit and style. The ""Devil"" is Miranda Priestly, Editor-in-Chief of fictional ""Runway"" magazine. Priestly is a thinly veiled characterization of Vogue Magazine's Editor-in-Chief. Commanded by Meryl Streep, Miranda is anything but caricature. As Miranda, Streep gives her most striking performance. She is simply awesome, and so deserving of her Oscar nomination in February. I love Anne Hathaway as Andy, Miranda's unlikely second assistant and eventual protégé. Hathaway of ""The Princess Diaries"" proves more than a younger Julia Robertsshe is a young Audrey Hepburn. First of all, Hathaway is classically beautiful, and has a smile that melts a room. She displays her natural smarts in her joyful presence. She has a deft light comic touch. She also has the star power to hold her own with Streep. Theirs is an amazing screen partnership. What touched me about ""The Devil"" is that it is a razor sharp comedy masking a touching rites of passage tale. The movie works because the context provided by Director David Frankel generates masterful performances by Streep, Hathaway, Stanley Tucci, and Emily Brunt.<br/><br/>Hathaway plays Andy Sachs, a young Northwestern University graduate with a journalism degree, who needs a job desperately. Through some human resources glitch Andy interviews for a second assistant position for Miranda Priestly at ""Runway"". Fashion retarded Andy, does not even know who Miranda is, much less that she should fear for her life. Miranda takes a chance and hires Andy given that she is so unlike her previous girlsbeing that Andy is the ""smart fat girl"". Be mindful that ""fat"" is in comparison to the couture starved. Miranda is merciless. I immediately liked Miranda, probably displaying my own twisted nature. However, I saw that Miranda was training Andy to be strong and survive in the shark infested world of high fashion. Hers in a strange way is ruthless compassion. This undercurrent resonates throughout. After having a horrific day, Andy fishes for sympathy from Nigel (great Stanley Tucci), Miranda's ace Art Director, who says, "" You're whining."" Knock it off. Andy endures unrelenting ordeal including a hilarious ""Harry Potter"" manuscript request. However, Andy cowboys up, and begins to gravitate to Miranda. Andy's relations including her boyfriend Nate (charming Adrian Grenier) begin to view Andy as a sell out. Andy gives her life to her job, no longer mocks the vapid nature of the fashion industry. I think it is director Frankel and screenwriter McKenna's point that Andy acknowledges the greatness in Miranda, and begins to aspire to that. However, the catch is that this at least for Miranda comes at a costsacrifice of her own humanity.<br/><br/>In a poignant limo ride scene Miranda says to Andy, ""I see a great deal of myself in you"" Andy says, ""I couldn't do something like that."" Miranda points out, ""You already did"" She then punctuates by saying, ""Everybody wants to be us."" Here Streep is killer, because it is not about vanity. It is fact, according to Miranda. In perhaps her most edgy and powerful performance Streep as Miranda is completely dominating and forceful, yet never raising her voice. She grants Miranda moments of frailty that beautifully capture what Miranda has forfeited on her rise to power. Streep can say more with a dispassionate gaze than entire pages of dialog. I think Miranda sees herself, and what she has lost in Andy. Here Hathaway brilliantly captures the embers of idealism and heart. Hathaway has radiant spirit, and her eyes speak eloquently for her. Everything about her performance is natural with an authentic charm. The rest of the cast is amazing. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as the prissy and wise Nigel. Emily Blunt masterfully balances the vulnerability and bitchiness of first assistant Emily.<br/><br/>It is mostly the unsaid that captivates and enthralls ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Watching Streep as Miranda as she introspectively gazes, and lets out a subtle smile reminded me why I love movies. When you have the right director, writers, and actors all coming together it is like magic. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is simply wonderful and amazing."

","As a guy, I avoided this movie because it had ""Chick Flick"" written all over it. Don't get me wrong, one of my favorite films is ""Thelma and Louise"", it's just that I could sniff this one out, and knew it would be a real drag to sit through. Anyway, it came on cable recently, I taped it, and watched the whole thing in about 6 sit downs. That was the only way to digest the platter of vomit that was ""The Devil Wears Prada"". Streep sleepwalked through her performance; there was very little about her character that moved me at all. Hathaway's character was not particularly likable, even though we are supposed to adore her and empathize with her heart wrenching decisions, one of which is cheating on her boyfriend with a sleaze bag fashion industry type. In fact, all of the characters are unlikable, even the aw-shucks boyfriend. This is a movie whose message tries to be ""The triumph of personal integrity over superficiality and ethically challenged ambition"". The attempt at conveying this message falls way short, because the movie spends too much time celebrating the superficiality it pretends to condemn. I was at least hoping for a Darth Vaderesque boss in Meryl Streep, but even that aspect of the movie was well off the mark. She was positively not intimidating. If you want to see a boss from hell movie, watch ""Swimming with Sharks"" with Kevin Spacey. That'll help you get over the headache-inducing waste of time that was ""The Devil Wears Prada""."

","Meryl Streep is one of my favorite female actors. She can act everything. She can be funny, smart, clever, ironic and etc. Miranda Priestly is shows the evil side of Merryl Streep. She acted so real, that I thought, that she is so bad in real life too.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway looks great in Andy Sachs character. She looks very mature in that role (if you watched ""Princess Diaries"").<br/><br/>Other actors looks great too. Emily Blunt has spice, that makes her a great actress. Simon Baker is one of the worst, but he acts better and better...<br/><br/>Movies was fantastic. It really makes my expectation looks like awful movie. I thinks, that it is the best book to movie adaptation in this century..."
"crazy_tejano","5","1","6","2 July 2006"," Commodity - not for critical thinkers
","This ""movie"" had a few elements that reminded me of what classic Hollywood films had: focused, quality acting, and a moral underpinning. Unfortunately, the former quality (as the movie was lacking in all others) was true for only one actress (Meryl Streep), and the latter was good only in theory, as the moral underpinning came across in a misguided and tortured manner. The rest of the movie is a commodity: it is clearly targeted at Gen-XY women, and thus glowing reviews will tend to come from that camp, rife with uncritical emotional prose.<br/><br/>Hollywood is obsessed with formulas. Like lemmings they persistently try to manipulate audience minds into liking a movie if the right ""formula"" is met. Well you can fool some people sometimes, but not all people all the time. This movie had it all: 1) rampant product placement targeted at yuppies, 2) a young hip urban setting targeted at yuppies, 3) self- righteous and promiscuous urban Gen-XY'ers acting in their usual shallow and self-absorbed manner, and lastly 4) a tortured moral message. <br/><br/>Of course, the moral message, which is the center of the film, is nothing but an uncreative feel-good regurgitation of Gen-XY's conventional wisdom. Thus, the movie is not a creative endeavor like movies of old, but a commodity--written by marketers and designed to pander to Gen-XY female's shallow sensibilities.<br/><br/>Some specifics: 1) Anne's friends (including the boyfriend), besides their mono-dimensional personalities, condescend and insult poor Anne for working hard and succeeding. At no point does Anne become mean-spirited or self-obsessed like Meryl Streep's admittedly acerbic character. On the contrary, her friends are guilty of that act. They are snobbishly nonchalant, despite their clear lack of respect and etiquette. The boyfriend is a mean-spirited idiot slob.<br/><br/>2) In line with the first point, the movie's contorted version of a person ""going bad"" was written to match Gen-XY's identically confused sensibilities. Gen-XYers are overly concerned with their ""identity""; they are obsessed with ""selling out."" Their morality is contradictory and ad-hoc. The movie is no different, and speaks directly to it. Thus, many of the ""glowing"" reviews of this movie are completely unable to grasp the illogic of the film's basic message-- that someone can go ""bad"" merely be being ambitious; that changing, developing, or evolving your adolescent opinions and life outlook is ""selling out"" (or, God forbid, if a Gen- Xer were to find religion and actually make ""judgments"").<br/><br/>3) This movie was marketed like Swimming with Sharks--where the pursuit of excellence is pushed to obsession and cruelty. This movie fell far short when it equated the pursuit of excellence with Gen-X's woeful and vague concept of ""selling out."" There is a hell of a lot of room between sloth (Gen-X, all the friends in the movie), and obsession, and Anne's character was healthily in between the two extremes.<br/><br/>Reviewers who have called the movie ""family-friendly"" due to an absence of sex must have been watching a different movie. Why oh why must Anne also be such a tramp? Must every female lead these days have sex with multiple partners in such a blase manner? Notice the Gen-XY way in which all this frivolous sex has no negative effects on her character. If this is the message viewers want for their families, then I fear for the future.<br/><br/>After reading this, one must think I hate the movie. Well I don't. Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep are entertaining actors. However, the movie reminded me of why I watch so few, and no television--surrounding any tiny sparkle of creativity is the odor of commodity tripe."
"chelenablount-1","6","1","8","4 February 2007"," Movie was very good...lead character could have been better
","I would've given the movie a 10 if it weren't for the non-convincing acting job of ANNE HATHAWAY. Pitting her against great actresses such as MERYL STREEP and Golden Globe winner EMILY BLUNT made her performance seem even worse.<br/><br/>She even made ADRIAN GRENIER look bad...and that's a pretty hard feat to master.<br/><br/>Her scenes were emotionless - there were times when she should've been pensive, or tearing, or aghast...but she gave the same 'deer-caught-in-the-headlights' look throughout the movie. Even in the final 'should've been dramatic' scene with Meryl Streep in the car (in Paris), when Andy finally realizes that she 'doesn't want to be like Priestly' there's no moment of realization on the face of Hathaway, but just that same 'deer-in-the-headlights' look she'd given throughout EVERY emotional moment in the movie. Oh, would you like another example? Sure.<br/><br/>When she was kissed in the art gallery by her 'pursuer' - her non-response made it look like her girlfriend was overreacting terribly when, in fact, Hathaway was 'under-acting'. Then when her boyfriend shows up and says two words to her she blows up in anger - now THAT made no sense at all because there was no build-up from the previous scene! I could go on and on until Armageddon...but I still will not be able to understand why Anne Hathaway was placed in this role. From something as silly and frivolous as 'Princess Diaries' and 'Ella Enchanted' to 'Prada'? Someone posted a 'goof' above regarding a bagel popping in and out of a scene (in Hathaway's hand)...the biggest goof was the director casting Hathaway in this role.<br/><br/>Too bad Andy couldn't have 'poofed' off the screen and when she came back could've miraculous turned into someone like...hmm, I don't know maybe - RACHEL McADAMS, someone who can REALLY act! Sorry to be so crude, but it annoyed me to spend over 2 hours watching bad acting. I could've been watching fresh paint dry."
"pyenme","6","0","1","11 May 2020"," How about what leaves us hanging?
","Okay, so this was a fun movie for me, and everyone who reviews it has an opinion. But here's what spoiled my complete enjoyment - the way it ended with Andy and Nate, and their living arrangements. This is NYC, expensive and hard to get an apartment NYC. And yet, after she returns from ""taking a break"" in Paris, where is she living? Nate stays in NYC until his move to Boston (assuming he is still in ""their"" apartment), and she stays in NYC to get a job, not to work on their relationship. So where did Andy go when she left Nate? She couldn't afford her rent sharing with him (remember, her father gave her money for ""rent"" when they were sharing), so how is she living? I know this may seem silly to some, but this little plot hole is distracting. And why didn't she communicate with him to see if they could work things out (and maybe move with him to Boston)? But now, he says maybe they CAN work things out. Does she need to find her own way and take the NYC job? Yes. So much for working it out. Another distraction. So while I really like this movie, don't care for the ending at all."
"yuenyeeac","8","0","1","10 May 2020"," After watching this movie
","I have always regarded fashion as vanity and the pursuit of little girls. The pursuit of fashion makes me feel uncomfortable, but as my age grows, some views have slowly changed. Attitude can largely reflect her attitude towards life. Exquisiteness, self-discipline, and love for life ... These beautiful qualities and fashion are closely connected. In addition, fashion can also reflect a person's aesthetic. People who understand beauty can always find the beauty of life.
A person's life depends largely on his choice, not his personality. Two people with similar personalities may also live diametrically opposite lives. However, no matter which kind of life you choose, you must do it To the extreme, this is responsible for oneself and for life. Once a decision is made, there will be a lot of things that need to be abandoned. When making these decisions, it is necessary to be decisive and determined, not to be nostalgic and hesitant.
This society is very good at implementing the rules of survival of the fittest. This is true in any field. Never complain about life. It is the key to improving your own abilities. When realizing your dreams, please do n't take the ideas of others too seriously, because, when a person makes a choice, it will always hurt some people. This is not anyone 's fault. Life is like this. When others stagnate, it is themselves who are ultimately hurt.
The relationship between people is not about accommodation, but about being yourself and showing your value. Use is not a derogatory term. To be precise, a person's use value determines his social status. Life and work can't be the best of both worlds. If you know the trade-offs and balance, you can get a better life, but you also lose the opportunity to do things to the extreme."

"HotToastyRag","3","0","1","21 April 2020"," Typical suburban comedy
","The Devil Wears Prada is one of those harmless ""soccer mom"" comedies that is meant to make women in the audience chuckle and men in the audience go to sleep. If you liked Under the Tuscan Sun, Eat Pray Love, Bridget Jones's Diary, or other similar chick flicks that feature an extremely average female protagonist who makes tons of mistakes, has more than one attractive man after her, and somehow manages to succeed and throw one-liners at those who have wronged her, you'll love this movie. It's fairly obvious from my description of the genre that I'm not a fan, and I spent more of the movie rolling my eyes than smiling.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway wants to balance a brilliant career and a wonderful relationship, but when she gets a new job as an assistant to a very demanding boss, her boyfriend Adrian Grenier starts to complain. Meryl Streep is the impossible, heartless, horrifying boss, but to anyone who's actually had a tough boss, she's not that bad. If you're the head of a successful fashion magazine, you're going to be a perfectionist. You wouldn't rise to the top if you settled for laziness, lateness, or mediocrity. She famously ends her orders with a careless, ""That's all,"" as she dons her sunglasses and dismisses her underling. Anne finds it rude and would rather be treated more humanely. Has she never had a job before? If she's that sensitive, she doesn't belong in the workforce, let alone in the fashion magazine industry.<br/><br/>Emily Blunt costars as Meryl's other assistant who resents Anne's ambition. Like everyone else's, her character is one-dimensional. Simon Baker is unrealistically perfect, Stanley Tucci is unnecessarily helpful, and Emily is incapable of smiling. Yes, given the title, you can expect to see a lot of pretty clothes and accessories, but is it really worth it?"

It's not a ""chick flick"" because it can speak to anybody; uplifting and insightful, timeless themes, such as the power of confidence (swings both ways, good and bad), standing up for yourself and just being yourself despite the flack, and basically retelling the ugly duckling story with a twist.

","Andy Sachs (Hathaway) is an aspiring journalist who takes a job at Runway, a New York fashion magazine, as an assistant to its powerful and much-feared editor, Miranda Priestly (Streep). But as she tries to get ahead in fashion and please Miranda, Andy finds her own values at risk.
It looks like a chick flick, dresses like a chick flick and name-checks a fashion house in its title, so you'd be forgiven for thinking that this is the long-rumoured Sex And The City movie - and the presence of sometime SATC director David Frankel at the helm would suggest you're right. But under the to-die-for threads of The Devil Wears Prada lurks a career-minded morality tale, wherein the gender of the two leads is of little importance - except that male stars would do themselves an injury in heels this high.
While the traditional girly movie sees some allegedly frumpy but really foxy starlet make eyes at an unattainable babe-magnet before realising she loves her best guy mate, this focuses on the oft-overlooked question of what our heroine actually does for a living. Hence this leading lady lives in a credibly small and grungy apartment, dresses badly and seems to be unacquainted with either Max Factor or Estée Lauder. There are dishy men around - Entourage's Adrian Grenier as her long-suffering boyfriend and Simon Baker as a predatory writer - but they're window-dressing for an altogether more businesslike tale.
Andy's story is about getting her foot on the career ladder, a familiar goal even for those who haven't gone through the meat-grinder of media recruitment. But her starter job as junior assistant to Runway magazine editor Miranda Priestly soon sees her life being made over along with her wardrobe. In the lead, Anne Hathaway continues her transition from cheery and freshfaced child star to cheery and freshfaced but accomplished adult actress (see also Havoc, reviewed this issue), with a down-to-Earth charm that draws inevitable comparisons to a young Julia Roberts. But, come next March, it will be Meryl Streep who receives her umpteenth Oscar nod for her role as the deliciously nasty Priestly.
In the slave-and-tell novel on which the film is based, Priestly is an unkind caricature, allegedly based on legendary Vogue editor Anna Wintour. Streep, however, manages the formidable task of giving her capricious tyrant some humanity without diluting her essential awfulness. Speaking in a soft, almost seductive monotone, she tears strips out of her assistants and withers unlucky editors with a glance - all while retaining a strange, charismatic hold over all around her. Soon her malign influence begins to warp her newest assistant, until Andy too finds herself adopting the values of her Mephistophelean mentor. Miranda's credo may be ""fashion is fabulous"" rather than ""greed is good"", but make no mistake - this is Gordon Gekko with better hair.
It's left to two other Runway employees to do the film's comedic heavy-lifting. The ever-dependable Stanley Tucci injects pathos into an underwritten part as the very camp and extremely shrewd art editor Nigel, Miranda's right-hand man. But it's relative newcomer Emily Blunt (My Summer Of Love) who very nearly steals the film as Miranda's senior assistant Emily, veering brilliantly between Miranda-lite bitchery and moments of real despair (admittedly, despair that is occasioned by the threat of taking away her couture, but it's real nevertheless).
From New York high society to Paris Fashion Week, the combination of low comedy and high fashion works beautifully. There are plot elements and the odd line that seem forced or formulaic, but the overall impression is fresh and stylish - an autumn/winter show that's worth a look, even for the sartorially-challenged."

My points: Andrea's friends know how important her job is to her to get her foot in the writing world but ridicule her with what her requirements and the amount of time she is missing spending with them. Miranda may be a demanding person as a boss, but there is an understanding with her assistants that after a year, they will be promoted - therefore, they need to be the most qualified for future positions and understand the complete ins and outs of the fashion world. Miranda also instills the definite separation of personal and profession parts of her life.

","Devil Wears Prada stars Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, and Emily Blunt. Anne Hathaway is a young journalist who gets a job as an assistant to Miranda Priestly, the boss of Runway fashion magazine. And Anne Hathaway slowly begins to learn that she signed a deal with the devil. I'm a guy and I know nothing about fashion. In fact I think I may the worst fashion sense that if Miranda Priestly were to walk in at any moment she would insult me. So all the scenes where they should the latest outfits had zero effect on me. But what I liked about Devil Wears Prada is that the producers, screenwriters, and costume department did their research and created what is Project Runway meets Heart of Darkness. And those two things don't really go together because when I think of Devil Wears Prada. I certainly don't think of those two things and when everyone took something as boring and mundane as Project Runway, give it a makeover and transform it into something dark and scary. Not scary as in horror, but scary as in a different side of the fashion industry that I never knew existed. Or I hope that doesn't exist behind close doors because I certainly wouldn't want that job. And Meryl Streep is the icing on the cake as she plays a ruthless, cold-hearted boss that she could be the devil herself of the fashion industry. As she that aurora of terror in her body and personality, that I could feel that energy pass over to me as she adds more fuel to the fire about how I would not work in the fashion industry or have a boss like that in general. Anne Hathaway is also brilliant as she plays everyone and anyone who gets their dream job or has landed a job, only for them to realize that their boss is cruel and cold-hearted. And we've all been in that position whether or not you care to admit it or not. I wouldn't exactly put this movie under the comedy section as I was naïve as to think that this would be another cheesy romantic comedy and it is. But watching this opened my eyes that putting this under the comedy genre would be a sin. Overall, I would summarize this movie as a light- hearted version of Heart of Darkness minus the intensity and the psychological thriller of the novel. So in the end while I may not have enjoyed the fashion aspect of the movie because I found it boring, I applaud the movie for taking two things that have nothing to do with each other and creating something that fun and entertaining to watch for girls and guys."

","The adaptation of the bestseller ""The Devil Wears Prada"" boasts Meryl Streep, Anne Hathaway and Emily Watson in the roles of Miranda Priestly, the almighty editor of the Runway magazine with a penchant for sadism, and her two assistants (Hathaway and Watson) who are all about trying to stay in her good book, to the extent of doing absolutely ridiculous tasks that border on sweatshop-style exploitation. Anne Hathaway continues her habit of makeover roles with Andy, the fashion-unconscious intern at Priestly's office who has Emily (Watson) sitting at the desk across from hers, throwing passive- aggressive insults at her all the time. The film is definitely worth checking out not just for Priestly's hilarious antics but also for Stanley Tucci's Nigel, the dramatic stylist who helps Andy with her make-over. The writing is brilliant, with good quips and a couple of great monologues from Tucci and Streep, whose speech on the influence of fashion on those who ignore it is very much on point. The bad part of the movie-although expected-is the fact that it's more or less like a film-length product placement, and the very antiquated notion that you need to abandon your career in order to satisfy your partner's vision of what's appropriate for you. But hey, to paraphrase Tucci, we're all in desperate need of Chanel, after all."

The commercial success and critical praise for Meryl Streep's performance continued in foreign markets with the film leading the international box office for most of October. Likewise, the U.S. DVD release was the top rental during December. The film finished in 2006's Top 20 both in the U.S. and overseas and grossed over $300 million, mostly from its international run.<br/><br/>Although the movie is set in the fashion world, most designers and other fashion notables avoided appearing as themselves for fear of displeasing U.S. Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who is widely believed to have been the inspiration for Priestly. Still, many allowed their clothes and accessories to be used in the film, making it the most expensively costumed film in history. Anna Wintour later overcame her initial skepticism, saying she liked the film and Streep in particular."

","I watched this movie a couple of weeks ago and given that I was informed that this is a hardcore chick flick, I was a little curious about what I was gonna get at the end of it but I must say it was a very pleasant laughter and some great acting to take away. Apart from the usual chick stuffs, Anne Hathaway looks very pretty and troubled enough in the role of a rookie who is literally driven to the limits by THE BOSS Meryl Streep, who I must add is a fantabulous actress indeed. Her dialogues and reactions are incredibly real and maybe, just maybe she could have done with a little more screen time. The story, well its plain and simple but directed and told very well. Stanley Tucci and the remaining cast support the overall pace of the movie aptly. The movie ends with a learning that most people chasing their dream job need to realize, their is a very fine balance to life with success on one side and everything related to your heart/emotions on the other so don't over weigh either or. :)"
"srinikethan","8","0","1","16 March 2014"," Very good in its own way
","I should really start with commending the fine job that Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep pulled off. The former is a wannabe writer who applies for a job and doesn't even know that she's got the devil in her boss. Andy (Anne) gets to be an assistant to the high flying Miranda (Streep), Editor of the fashion magazine, ""Runway"", a role that no one could have done more justice to than Streep herself. You would in no instance doubt the power wielded by Ms.Streep in her role as Miranda.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book so I wouldn't know how truly the movie sticks to it, but then I don't think David Frankel could have really done anything different to make the movie finer. The plot of the movie is really simple - How Andy tackles all the challenges that entail her job, and how many challenges she really puts up with before getting frustrated. We have all been in a similar position in our lives, when we just couldn't say ""No"" to our boss. Miranda gives Andy a bucket load of tasks right through the day and sometimes even late into the night, just when she's hanging out her gang of friends which includes her live-in boyfriend. Andy feels suffocated and out of place with all her lack of interest in the fashion world, it's just a job in her run up to becoming a writer. She just keeps reminding herself that she doesn't wanna tip over and be just another assistant to Miranda who got fired but show her mettle. She gets resistance in the form of Emily Blunt, first assistant to Miranda who does a neat job of showcasing in certain instances how badly she wants Andy to fail.<br/><br/>You do end up feeling sorry for all the characters caught up in the corporate humdrum of meaningless jobs and how much personal disconnect has crept into our lives. The movie does have a lot of funny moments to make you laugh and picks your interest to watch the relationships change on screen. Whether Andy sucks up to Miranda, learns fashion sense and puts her personal relationships on the line or just calls it quits and chooses life over work makes up for the evolution of the story. All in all, an enjoyable watch for a Sunday afternoon!"

","By the time I wrote this review, I haven't read the entire ""Devil Wears Prada"" novel yet; however, I heard this movie does follow the book pretty well and does it justice. The movie's steady-paced and somewhat intriguing plot tells the story of naive Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), who comes to New York and lands a job as the assistant to the demanding and cynical Miranda Priestly, one of the city's big-time magazine editors.<br/><br/>I enjoyed watching Miranda Priestly's (Meryl Streep) performance the most - devious, sarcastic, a go-getter and one who expects the job to be done. It is amusing to watch her intimidate Andy and her co-workers with her presence and her flashy clothes, and it is interesting to see Miranda run the entire company with a queen-like approach. Her telling Andy that people would line up to get her job as assistant reminded me of some of the earlier jobs I had in government offices - pay is not grand, but the workplace is prestigious.<br/><br/>While the majority of the film is focused on Andy meeting Miranda's demands and deciding how she wants to continue with her life, which I thought was a fascinating plot, I thought the subplot of the romance between her and her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier) was boring and dragged the movie's pace.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a very nice film and is mostly entertaining for a comedy drama.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

","I like this film a lot. To me, it's quite an old fashioned film, like a backstage drama of old Hollywood. As usual Meryl Streep nails the lead role as Miranda the editor of Runway. She is the heart and soul of the film. I feel that Anne Hathaway is all wrong as Andy, the wide-eyed personal assistant. While Hathaway looks great and tries hard, I don't think she's subtle enough here. I think the role would have suited someone new, and less of a superstar. Emily Blunt is very funny in her role as Miranda's more senior, snootier PA, but she does overdo the expressions a little. Stanley Tucci, as the magazine's art director, is wonderful as usual, very likable, however some of his lines are too deep and meaningful, conveying the all important moral Message.

","Liza Papageorgiou The Devil Wears Prada (2006) Director: David Frankel<br/><br/>Gee; what is The Devil Wears Prada's level of ambition and what is it trying to aim to do? In my public opinion, the whole movie strives to explain who the main character, Andy Sachs, truly is. At the beginning of the movie Andy is introduced as ""the fat, smart girl"" by Miranda Priestly, the editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, also Andy's ""hell on heels"" boss. However, in reality, Andy is a size six, and is not interested in the fashion industry. Of course, to have actually landed a job as great as the assistant of one of the most highly respected editors in New York City, she does dress as a so called ""outsider"". Andy scored ""the job that a million girls would kill for"", and whoever could last with Miranda for a year, could get a job at any publication of their choice (which was . The Devil Wears Prada, being one of my favorite movies, did succeed at depicting Andy realizing who she truly is well. <br/><br/>The reason that the film did a good job at leading the audience to Andy's true colors is because at the beginning of the movie, the way Andy truly is, is shown and throughout the movie, the film slowly progresses by showing the audience how Andy transforms from ""the nerd from a little town in Ohio"", to ""the hot fashion chick of New York City""! During Andy's dramatic transformation, Andy loses her close friends, family, and even her true love. In exchange of those people she gains, popularity at work, new pals such as Nigel, the magazine's true legend, and a hot new author boyfriend, Christian Thompson. <br/><br/>One part of the movie that seemed to have supported this topic well was towards the end when Andy is getting ready for Miranda's presentation. While applying mascara to her eyes, Andy has flashbacks of how she was at the beginning of the movie and how she changed to drastic measures just to impress her boss and land a job in the publication business after Runway. One part of the movie that seems to oppose the overall theme of the movie is when non-important characters are focused on such as Nigel becoming James Holt's (fashion designer) executive assistant. I believe that that part is unimportant and had nothing to do with Andy realizing her true inner being."

","Before reading, the movie review contain spoiler. The Devil Wears Prada is a comedy and drama movie in 2006. Andrea Sachs who was played by Anne Hathaway, a naive girl just graduated. She goes to New York City to be the second assistant for powerful and demanding fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly who was played by Meryl Streep. Andrea dreams to be a journalist, so she faces challenges from Miranda. Although she has been helped by other people, she not only gradually lost her personal and private life with her family, friend and boyfriend, but also is far away from her dream. This movie was set in fashion word. This element is attracted people who like fashion. Many designers allowed their clothes and accessories to be used in the film, making it the most expensively costumed film in history. But is this only reason to make people like it? I think there is another important reason that people love to see struggle for success or find the meaning of life. In this plot, Andrea has to make huge effort to make her ""devil"" boss appreciate her. In other words, she is not a princess who was born with beauty, fortune and prince charming; she is just a normal girl who looks like most of normal people in this world. But she still has some great characters which plenty of people don't own. Such as kind, clever, insistence and the rational to refuse temptation. On the other hand, we love Miranda too; she is an independent woman who is stronger than many men. She loves her fashion career deeply; even she did many iron-fisted policies which man would not do. However, she is not a cold, mechanical, soul-dead woman, she also is a mother who loves her daughters, a woman who wants to have a good relationship; also she is a good boss to find other people's talents and has kind heart to recommend Andrea to her new boss. From my point of view, I love both Andrea an Miranda. However, it's more difficult to play Miranda, because she is more complex. As we see, Meryl Streep indeed is a great actress; she played this role very well. I love the way she played Miranda, she never speak louder but makes you feel dignified. By the way, I love the songs in the movie, it's really beautiful."

","This is not the kind of movie I would pick out if I were watching it alone, but I'll concede a title every now and then so my wife can relate to something other than a Western or an action film. I'm going to have to assume that Prada refers to some fashion designer or line of clothing, since there was no explanation given, and I'm not going to look it up. I expected something predictable here once Meryl Streep was introduced as the Dragon Lady, and Anne Hathaway as the aspiring writer, but predictability would also have required Miss Andy to explode just once to gain Miranda Priestley's respect, and I kept waiting and waiting for it. Since it never happened, there was nothing else at all to make this movie stand out from virtually any other comedy/romance date flick that's come down the pike. Consequently, Hathaway's performance was far from exceptional, even as Streep continues to stretch her range as an actress who can virtually do it all. With only so-so performances by the remainder of the cast, the most recommendable thing about this movie is it's title, and that only gets you up to the opening credits."

","What makes DWP work as a bland, comfort film is what makes it not work as anything close to a good movie: namely, the paint-by-numbers script. Everything is rote, from the obligatory crew of friends (Black, gay, boyfriend) to the really awful story transitions that actually come from nowhere; you're just expecting them because that's how these tales go, and not because the script properly sets them up. That is, based on friend and boyfriend reactions, Hathaway has become a work-obsessed, different person. It's supposedly what's driving the story, this alteration of her nature. But we don't get this. Yeah, she looks good and performs an impossible job at ridiculous hours, but she remains her sweet self. Yet, to hammer home this drastic 'character change', the lame device of having her repeat that she 'had no choice' is employed. A lot. The contrivance is embarrassing and pointless because she has not changed as a character. Oh, well. La Streep is La Streep. Always amazing (except for that mess, 'Mamma Mia!', which God Himself couldn't save).

But she looks like what most of us aspire to, but don't...which BTW, DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE ARE UNHAPPY AT ALL. We just appreciate beautiful looking people like some others appreciate beautiful art or beautiful scenery. <br/><br/>With that in mind, my friends and I have compiled a list of ""10 BEST MAKEOVER MOVIES"" of recent times (after 1995). <br/><br/>And here they are: (in random order) 1) CLUELESS 2) PRETTY WOMAN 3) THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA 4) JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE 5) MAID IN MANHATTAN 6) MY BIG FAT Greek WEDDING 7) SHE'S ALL THAT 8) MISS CONGENIALITY 9) MEAN GIRLS 10) AMERICANIZING SHELLEY.<br/><br/>Although, personally...CLUELESS is #1 and all the others are #2.<br/><br/>I am also putting together a different list of ""10 BEST MAKEOVER MOVIES"" of all times (prioe to 1995). Please do post me a message voting for your ""10 BEST MAKEOVER MOVIES"" prior to 1995. And yes, I SO TOTALLY recommend this film (if you haven't already watched it)...whether you like ""makeover movies"" or not."
"Red-125","7","0","1","1 January 2008"," Meryl Streep can do no wrong!
","The Devil Wears Prada (2006) was directed by David Frankel. This is a movie about the fashion industry. In it we learn that, in fashion, it's better to be thin than not to be thin, people pretend to like each other when they don't, people with power and prestige tend to exercise their power and prestige, and people betray their friends if such betrayal will help them obtain or retain power. Shocking, truly shocking!<br/><br/>Please don't see this film for the plot. The movie requires a true suspension of disbelief. We're asked to believe that an honors graduate of Northwestern University goes for a job interview at a fashion magazine and doesn't know the name of the magazine's editor. It doesn't occur to her to dress up, rather than dress down, for the interview. She chooses an onion bagel for breakfast. (All of that is just in the first five minutes of the movie.)<br/><br/>We also have to believe that Anne Hathaway is frumpy and dowdy before she learns about fashion at her new job. Makeup and costuming did their best, but Anne Hathaway is Anne Hathaway, and she's drop-dead beautiful even before someone gives her high heels and designer dresses.<br/><br/>So--why see the movie? Three reasons--the fashions really are great; Paris looks wonderful; and Meryl Streep can do no wrong. Streep plays Miranda Priestly--demonic in her intensity and her demands, never looking anything other than her best, and contemptuous of anyone who doesn't recognize that the fashion industry is the center of the Universe. That portrayal doesn't require us to have any suspension of disbelief whatever. Streep has the talent to make you believe in her character, and the physical presence to stand out in a room filled with supermodels. Streep can inhabit a character so completely that it's hard to believe that, when the filming is over, she's really Meryl Streep and not the character she plays.<br/><br/>This is a movie worth seeing, as long as you don't expect to leave the theater with a new and profound appreciation of the difference between good and evil. See the movie because it's great to look at, and it's a pleasure to watch Meryl Streep do what only she can do."

","First let me say, I really enjoy this movie. I think Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep both do a tremendous job acting in this movie and that the movie is well put together and well executed. But, I am insulted by the message throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Another user commented that this movie's message is ""to thine own self be true."" And I do agree with this, but I think that Andrea has to deal with far too much grief from her friends and family while she is simply trying to pursue her dream. Overall, I believe the message in this movie discourages women from pursuing their professional dreams at the cost of their social lives and in the end, oversimplifies and degrades the reason Andrea completely put herself into her job, when Nate says she did it for the clothes and the shoes. Though it was apparent she enjoyed her new appearance, that was never how I felt she behaved. She should be commended for doing what it takes to get the job done, for not giving up, and for pursuing her dream, even if it came in a different form from what she expected. She excelled in her position. It's appalling how unsupportive and disrespectful her friends and family are. Being someone who has worked in the entertainment industry for a very similar high-maintenance boss, I can relate to Andrea and her experience. Thankfully, my friends and family were much more supportive and understanding of the commitment that it took to undertake such a position. Not to mention, in this movie, her friends are able to pursue their dreams (don't cooks generally also have to put in a lot of hours?) and don't give her the same respect.<br/><br/>I just think that this is a poor lesson. It is not so simple as ""to thine own self be true"" but is more like a lesson for women to forget their careers and follow their friends and family."

Ann Hathway was her usual self... a lost beauty who slowly develops into an enchanting strengthened character through the middle of the movie. And Meryl Streep....well she was awesome, radiating authority throughout giving the movie the color it needed. To be true, I was really looking forward to get a hint of her weaker side, some transformation of her character, courtesy Ann Hathway.... but it was none and that is the biggest positives and realism of this movie. Her powerful portrayal of a fashion mogul, undaunted by private and professional circumstances around her, really deserved an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>All other characters did their part well.....

Unless you've worked for someone like this you would have no idea of what extraordinary demands are placed upon a young person trying to make it in the business world --- and how it infringes upon their personal lives. I loved Anne Hathaway as the young assistant and was captivated by Simon Baker and their little rendezvous. She is totally adorable and he is quite a hunk.

","I was expecting more from this because it got a Best Comedy nomination from the Golden Globes and a BAFTA nomination for Best Screenplay, but really, it's mostly just a chick flick. It follows almost all of the chick flick clichés. A whiny protagonist, a bitch antagonist, the whiny protagonist and bitch antagonist getting on goodish terms at the end, flamboyant gay guys, a charming guy who is exposed as a two timing jerk, the whiny protagonist's boyfriend being some guy with no personality, etc.<br/><br/>But it was enjoyable.

","I must admit, it took watching the beginning of this movie 3 times before I got interested enough to follow through to the end. Once I finally realized it was not really a comedy, the movie started to work for me.<br/><br/>Generally stated, the story is about a recent college grad who lands a job as assistant to the head of a top fashion magazine. The funny things is, this isn't her field and her values are at odds with everything about her new job.<br/><br/>If you think the plot sounds familiar, it is - it's been done a million times. Plus - the characters are fairly simplistic and one-dimensional.<br/><br/>So what's so good about the movie? First, the performances for each of the characters are near perfect. They become very ""watchable"" - you want to see what they are going to do next and what's going to happen to them.<br/><br/>The second thing that really intrigued me were the bits of information about the fashion industry - they were very nicely integrated into exchanges between the characters. If anything, you'll get a feel for how ego, tension and subjectivity can play out in a fashion magazine.<br/><br/>As long as you know that this is really a drama (or black comedy without much comedy), you can enjoy this movie from the start."

","I had heard quite about this film saying it is one of the lead actresses best roles, I guess I can agree, this is quite a good comedy drama. Basically simple, naive and just-graduated Andrea 'Andy' Sachs (The Princess Diaries' Anne Hathaway) gets a job as the second assistant, along with Emily (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Emily Blunt), to powerful, sophisticated, ruthless and merciless executive of the Runway fashion magazine, Miranda Priestly (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Meryl Streep). As she spends more time there trying to best she can for her cruel boss, Andy is finding herself being rushed and multi-tasked, and none of it is getting her noticed by Miranda, till Nigel (Stanley Tucci) gives her a new look, and Emily teaches her how to be around her. These changes to her attitude and behaviour do cause problems with her personal life as well, with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier). In the end, at the peak of her notice and contribution to the company, she learns that she has to make her own choices in life, so she quits, and gets a new job, with the help of Miranda. Also starring Simon Baker as Christian Thompson, Tracie Thoms as Lily, Rich Sommer as Doug and Daniel Sunjata as James Holt. It was nominated the Oscar and BAFTA for Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Make Up & Hair and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Meryl Streep was number 58 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 26 on The World's Greatest Actor. Worth watching!"

At first, I thought that I would just listen to my music for the whole movie, because I thought that I wouldn't like it, but the sound in the theater for the movie was so loud that I couldn't hear my iPod when i turned it up all the way, so I was stuck watching the movie. Surprisingly, I sat through the entire movie, looking at the screen, without leaving once to use the restroom, even when I had to go.

","This movie is not for anyone who takes their movies seriously or watches with incredible amounts of attention. Mainly because the scriptwriters have managed to leave great big holes in the plot. For e.g. you don't really get to see Anne's ambitious nature. It's just mentions as a sideline kind of thing. I also got the impression that the fashion world wasn't exactly exposed enough. There wasn't really much to say that wow she's doing so well. Also I felt that Anne didn't really commit any crime for trying to do well at her job. I mean you have to make some sacrifices in any job. I was disappointed when Anne didn't realise that & the fact she'd been only exposed to a successful businesswoman who failed in her married life is a bit stereotypical. You can do what you want and some people still find the balance in their lives. Thus, I HATED the ending. On the plus side, Meryl & Emily shine as the nasty pieces of work."

","Ah, the Devil Wears Prada. What can I say about this one? Well, for starters I thought the performances (specifically Meryl's and Emily's) were fantastic. The story (although predictable) was enough to keep you interested. One of the main things that makes me give this movie a 10 is the dialog. Some of the dialog in this movie is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone old or young (my grandmother has seen it and absolutely adores it). There scarcely is a movie dubbed a 'chick-flick' that I will enjoy enough to give it a ten. This movie, however, is the best 'chick-flick' (I don't really think it is a chick flick) movie I've seen, but its also up there with my favorites of all time.

"DAHLRUSSELL","9","0","3","5 March 2007"," SEX IN THE CITY lite - Colorful and fun
","Every other decade or so, a major studio film comes along that is about fashion more than anything else, with fantastic clothing, a focus on clothing and fads, a good script, big name actors and cooperation of the great designers of the day. The DWP is that film for this decade, and joins the ranks of THE WOMEN (1939), HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE (53), FUNNY FACE (57), A NEW KIND OF LOVE (63), WHAT A WAY TO GO (64), and to a lesser extent CLUELESS (95), and LEGALLY BLONDE (2001). All bright, fun and entertaining, and this is too!<br/><br/>Meryl Streep has never (not even at the Oscar ceremonies) ever looked lovelier than she is in this film, as she embodies the jaded fashionista woman of the turn of the millennium. She is the title character in this modern day morality tale pitting ""goods"" against good. When we finally see behind the facade, we see the same Streep we usually see at core.<br/><br/>The young, lushly pretty Anne Hathaway (still Disney Princess perfect) plays the ""smart fat girl"" in a piece of incongruous casting. While the joke here is partially that she is NOT fat, this is also a piece of Industry hypocrisy; pointing out the lunacy while doing nothing to correct it. This story follows her path from idealism to selling out in a story that was main-streamed in the process of turning from book to film. The commentary track of the reel details how often they strove to make her character ""identifiable,"" which means they took a fuller character and made her more bland; and indeed this is a somewhat Disney-fied version of a single girl's life and trials there is so much territory to cover that relationships are left much more to short hand than to real development.<br/><br/>These ""fashion"" films definitely reflect the commonplace morality of the times in their leading lady, and this is no exception. Not entirely airbrushed, this character is living unmarried with a boyfriend and one of her temptations is a more fashionable upscale guy (I won't spoil this plot point by telling ), so it is rather SEX IN THE CITY  lite. In this day of international markets, while this character's morality is OK in the US, in many foreign markets any word to describe her would not be nice. <br/><br/>While this is a bright, brisk ""romantic-comic"" film with the usual (more mawkish than mainstream) family-friendly sentiments adhered to overall; you should be really careful when having children watch this; not only because the insidious ethics enacted by Hathaway's supposedly sweet, smart, character, but precisely because she has been a Disney heroine, and may be regarded as more of a role model for that reason.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is fantastic with Stanley Tucci & Emily Blunt leading the fashion brigade. Colorful, and completely enjoyable, a bubble gum treat."

I loved the cast and the trailer, which took a different approach to marketing (by showing one of the earlier scenes in the movie, instead of a series of edited scenes cut together). When it opened alongside ""Superman Returns"", however, I had to make a choiceand I, ultimately, chose to see ""Superman Returns"" simply because, I felt that it was a film that would be much better on the big-screen and wanted to witness it as such. I enjoyed that movie and I am glad that I chose to see it in theatersbut I still had to see ""The Devil Wears Prada"". When it came out on DVD, I rushed out and bought it (blind buys are not my usual thing, but I just had to do it for this film). As I waited for the movie to begin, a thought crossed my mind. What if ""The Devil Wears Prada"" wasn't as good as I thought it was? What if it was a disappointment? Sure, critics liked it and Meryl Streep was practically guaranteed an Oscar nominationbut, suddenly, I was a little worried. But, did it live up to my original expectations or were my fears realized? <br/><br/>Andy Sachs (Hathaway) is a young journalism major who moved to New York City in hopes of finding a job at a major publication. When things down go as planned, Andy is forced to apply for a job at ""Runway"", a fashion magazine. The job is far from the journalist position she so desperately wanted, but it is something. It's a position as an assistant for legendary fashion editor, Miranda Priestly (Streep). Andy, having never heard of her before, does not know that she is possibly the devil incarnate in high heels and with a Prada purse. Andy, despite not being the typical fashion lover, gets the jobbut she realizes that it is possibly one of the hardest jobs imaginable. But, with the help of Nigel (Tucci), the magazine's art director, Andy will reinvent her life and prove that she is tough enough to handle Miranda and all of her crazy demands. But, what she will learn is that, sometimes, it just isn't worth it.<br/><br/>When ""The Devil Wears Prada"" ended, I wanted to watch it again. When I am compiling my ""Top Ten"" list at the end of every year, one of the things I look at is how I reacted when the movie ended. It is necessary that I must have had an instant desire to watch the movie again right after it was over. I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Devil Wears Prada"" and thought it was one of the best comedies of the year, sporting great performances and a poignant message that is not over-baked. Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses ever and this is one of her best performances. It's a bitter, yet subdued performance. She could have gone over-the-top and could have griped and complained the entire movie (which would have cheapened the performance), but she did not. She used great amounts of restraint and it worked beautifully. Anne Hathaway, one of the best young actresses, gives yet another nice performance, handling herself very well. I enjoyed it. The true breakout star of ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is Emily Blunt who aced the role, giving a cold performance with a twist of sarcasm. It was great.<br/><br/>On the slight downside, I thought there were a few moments that made us question Andy's integrity. I won't go into the details, but I found the moments to be slightly unnecessary. Not only were they ultimately a pointless subplot, but they detached us from our lead character. However, every other aspect comes together wonderfully. The music, the direction, the performances, and, of course, the fashion are all blended together in perfect proportions. It is a hilarious movie that works so well due mainly to its cast and its director who gives a certain element of style and class to the whole film. ""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a great comedy that never fails to entertain.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Funny and well-made, ""The Devil Wears Prada"" proves that comedies don't have to be cheesy and recycled.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 10/10 (A+)"

","Oh, what a seductive little cheat this movie was. From the title, one obviously expects a little Faustian morality tale about the seductive lure of the superficial (but gorgeous!), and at one level, that's what you get. Unfortunately, like movies whose ostensible point is to condemn violence by tossing in titillating heaps of it, The Devil Wears Prada whorishly revels in the world it satirizes. It hits many girls where they live (beautiful clothes, cool make-overs, etc.)and at the same time asks them to please reject it all. <br/><br/>Let's consider our heroine. We can't have her REALLY go over to the dark side,even a little, can we? She'll discover how good she can look with a new haircut and nifty Chanel thigh-highs (and, oh, she does look good). She'll get to go to Paris, too (hey, we'd looooove to see Fashion Week there)-- and not by just selfishly accepting the offer at the expense of her colleague. Heck no. Said colleague will get hit by a car. SHE's in no shape for Paris, so why shouldn't Andy go? She also gets to have some kissing-under-the-lamppost,postcardy ooh-la-la with Simon Baker and still not cheat on her doting boyfriend (they were conveniently ""on a break,"" so no-harm, no-foul sort of deal). Clothes, Paris, extracurricular sex, and . . . how does it all end? Right back where it started. Our heroine gets the high ground and gets to enjoy the low ground, too. <br/><br/>And our ""devil"" of the title? Bitch or Mistress of the Universe? She has it both ways as well. We're meant to deplore and laugh at her high-handed ridiculousness, yet admire her for just doing what it takes to be a success in a man's world. <br/><br/>So ultimately how are we supposed to feel about Andy's excursion into the fashion world?

I don't know that the movie needed to explore that relationship more but frankly, for the amount of time spent on developing that side of things, they could have been shown as two people dating in separate cities.<br/><br/>Of course, part of the movie takes place in Paris, so that was lovely, lovely.

However, if you've read the book before seeing the film then the film is a big disappointment. Large sections of the book were chopped, the only things that seemed to remain were the character names, the magazine name and trip to Paris. Even the supporting characters were changed, such as Nate, Andy's boyfriend. In the book he's a teacher, in the film he's a cook. Minor plot lines didn't survive the chop either, such as when Andy collected Miranda's pet, which is a huge dog in the film, a cat in the book. This was obviously done for effect, so the dog can be seen dragging Andy along in her heels. The same can be said for when Emily gets hit by the car. This was obviously done to be more dramatic, dragging it further from the source material. I could go on but I don't want to put people off completely. I make one suggestion - if you've read the book, don't watch the film, you'll be horribly disappointed, like I was."

","This is movie is apparently about fashion but really about human nature. What are you aiming at in life when you chose a job? Just only something that gives you a salary that allows you to pay for your expenses and survive? Or something that fulfills the deepest aspirations of your personality? Or something that gives you power over other people? Or something that will eventually place you up in the social scale? Or something at which you can show your special talent and skill? And how can you deal with a tyrannical boss that doesn't show the least respect for you as a human being? These are the questions put in this movie and with great talent by its director. Meryl Streep does an excellent part as the tough and tyrannical boss of a famous fashion magazine. The atmosphere of the magazine offices is hectic due mainly to the permanent orders and countermands of the despotic director which often causes the newly admitted assistant (Anne Hathaway's character) to be stricken with panic. All these scenes and situations are shown and developed in a tremendous but excellent visual rhythm and the cast performing is also superb. This is was undoubtedly one of the best movies of the year. But can anyone please tell what the movie title has got to do with its contents?"

On the contrary, they are quite universal and all of us end up facing some of them in our own way. This might help us to understand why the film attracted huge audiences to the cinemas. It wasn't just because it is great fun, but because there is a lot else in it. I was, of course, impressed by Meryl Streep's performance but surprised by Emily Blunt's ! She's fantastic!

"blanche-2","7","0","1","13 January 2007"," The inspiration for Ugly Betty
","I don't know when the wonderful TV series ""Ugly Betty"" was conceived, but the parallels with ""The Devil Wears Prada"" are numerous. Anne Hathaway is Andy, a sweet young aspiring journalist with no fashion sense who is, to everyone's shock, hired by the boss from right out of hell, Miranda (Meryl Streep), editor in chief of Runway Magazine. Confessing that every other assistant has been horrible, Miranda, while telling off Andy says, ""So I said to myself, take a chance, hire the smart fat girl."" Andy learns fashion from one of Miranda's fashion henchmen, Nigel (Stanley Tucci), and slowly but surely gets more and more sucked into Miranda's demands and life at Runway. Her friends notice a change, and her boyfriend believes they no longer have anything in common. ""Wait until your life blows up in your face,"" Nigel advises her, ""then it will be time for a promotion."" The bitchy world of fashion is fun to watch. No one eats and everyone is shallow. Size 6 is the new size 14, so says Nigel. The politics are behind closed doors, vicious, and make for a rousing scene in the film - and a look at just how evil and disloyal people can be. It's never anything personal; it's just the way it is.<br/><br/>And that is what's not fun. Too many people have told me that Mildred ""is my boss."" It's hard to believe but it must be true. And the politics? Having once been a victim of behind closed door politics myself, I can attest that they, too, are equally true. While it gives one a few chuckles in a film, the reality is that corporate life today is ugly.<br/><br/>I enjoyed ""The Devil Wears Prada"" very much, particularly the marvelous performances of Streep, Tucci, Hathaway, and Emily Blunt as a frazzled ex-assistant, Hathaway, and the sexiness of Simon Baker. However, I basically felt like it was a movie for really young people. I'm not the target audience. And that's another thing: the message about women, targeted to really young women, has been Hollywood's message about women since there was a Hollywood. If you want to be miserable, be a powerful person in your chosen field. There, you will find yourself alone, i.e., manless. It gets a little tired after a while.<br/><br/>If the message is tired, the production values, the performances, and the clothes are anything but. There's some great humor to be had as well. I saw this on DVD and had a miserable time adjusting the volume. The music was too loud and the voices too loud - proof that I'm not the target audience."

","*************this might contain spoilers**************** I want to get this down while it's still fresh. I liked The Devil Wears Prada. For a couple of hours you couldn't ask for a more entertaining movie. Merle Streep has gotten 'hold of a meaty part and exploits it for all it's worth. Somehow I was thinking of Jane Fonda who I think could have done it up brown but sadly, Fonda is not a money screen name anymore. Some think that Streep should win some kind of award, I don't. Sure, it's a good role and she knows it and does justice to her part but Acadamy Award caliber, no. Now, if you want to talk awards, I thought that Ann Hathaway was terrific and she held her own against Streep. Many thought that the ""career girl"" whose name I can't remember was outstanding, I thought she was goo, too, but not outstanding. Getting back to Hathaway, she reminded me a lot of the young Liza Minnelli, for some reason. I also liked Stanley Tucci although he always plays heavy's or butch types, he looked liked he was enjoying himself. What I did get to see was the great attention paid to the haute couture world that one did not get in Robert Altman's Ready To Wear film. And the last time I remember seeing a movie about a woman's fashion magazine was in Funny Face when Kay Thompson slamming the latest edition of her mag said to her staff "" this doesn't speak to me and if it doesn't speak to me it doesn't speak to the women of the world."" She also said "" the women of the world is standing out there, naked, ready for me to tell her what to wear. But if she's gotta think, think pink!""<br/><br/>All in all I think it's nice to rent some evening. I liked the high production and the outreageous clothes that women seem to like."

Starting slowly,it gets better. The cinematography and sound is good. The part of Vince holds the entire flick together. It does tend to reveal the works of the real fashion business. New York is the pivot here. Anne Hathaway could have been a little less scripted. I would still recommend it if seen at half price. Defending Your Life remains my favorite Streep movie. .........

I rented it, since I never read the book, and loved it, until the end.<br/><br/>The performances here are great, especially Anne Hathaway as Andy and Emily Blunt as Emily. Meryl Streep was amazing and believable as the cold Editor in Chief Miranda Preistly, who would do anything to save her job. Stanley Tucci was adorable. The plot really interested me as well. And the clothes were absolutely fabulous. The ending just didn't seem believable to me at all. Naive Andy knew what she was getting into when she stepped foot into the building, and the fact she is even the least bit surprised at what she did to Emily after Miranda points it out is nuts. What got me even more is that she decided to leave. As numerous characters pointed out, hundreds of girls would kill for that job, and she was lucky enough to get it. The fact she would walk away from it peeved me off greatly, since this would be a job I would do anything for.<br/><br/>This was a great film, but, as stated before, the ending just wasn't believable to me."
"steve-pet-peeve","Null","0","1","2 January 2007"," Here's why it fails
","The story is unsatisfying because of the following reason: 1) the hero is not sympathetic. The only two decent people in the script are the boyfriend and the gay guy. Both of these guys get screwed over in the story, the gay guy by Meryl Streep and the boyfriend by the hero of the movie. The hero (or heroine) cheats on her boyfriend, betrays her own values, yet we are supposed to root for her? I didn't like the woman. And because I didn't, I didn't care if she was abused or not by the villain.<br/><br/>2) The villain doesn't get her just desserts. She gets no comeuppance, which is something we want to see happen to bad people. That's why this story is not satisfying at all. She gets away with being a total creep to people without any punishment at all. In good stories, bad people get punished at the end.<br/><br/>This was a very mediocre film, and the people that enjoy it are the easily amused riff-raff that populate this country."
"rbverhoef","7","0","1","28 December 2006"," Average comedy, lifted by performances
","In a way 'The Devil Wears Prada' is a very recommendable film. It contains enough laughs for a comedy and is build around a perfect performance from Meryl Streep. On the other hand the film always feels fabricated, with scenes both predictable and unnecessary. We follow a young girl, just graduated, named Andy (Anne Hathaway) who takes the job of Miranda Priestly's assistant. Priestly is the chief editor of a fashion magazine and although Andy gives nothing about fashion, it will help her to get a job for any magazine later in life. Miranda (Streep) is the devil from the title, driving most people around her crazy. Of course Andy's personal life, especially dealing with boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier), will be messed up. Close to Miranda are her first assistant Emily and fashion man Nigel, superbly played by Emily Blunt and Stanley Tucci.<br/><br/>Reading the above gives you probably an idea of how the screenplay will continue. But the film does not really care for its own story and why should it? It has Meryl Streep. Every single scene is made entertaining by her, and admittedly, Blunt does the same things with her scenes. For some reason it is always fun to see mean people as long as you are able to realize they probably have a good heart. Hathaway is the sweet girl and she is good in playing sweet girls. That said 'The Devil Wears Prada' is basically just another comedy, elevated by performances. Worth seeing, most definitely, but don't expect too much because then it might disappoint you."

","""The Devil Wears Prada"" is a fish out of water comedy based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger whose experiences at ""Vogue"" Magazine inspired her bestseller. The film follows aspiring journalist Andy Sachs into the offices of ""Runway"" magazine, as she stumbles into the ill-fitting shoes of the second assistant to tyrannical editor Miranda Priestly. Andy has no intention of being outdone by this job which she initially looks down upon, but as the story rolls along she begins to sell out her dreams, spending every waking hour on call for her new boss and the inevitable transformation that brings.<br/><br/>Anne Hathaway brings certain clumsiness to the role of Andy that makes the tones of ""Pollyanna"" that much easier to spot. As endearing her characterization is, her performance is frequently overshadowed by Emily Blunt, who plays Miranda's bitter, British, first assistant. Of course neither can hold a candle to Meryl Streep's flawless take on Miranda, the devil in the title. The film makes for great fun and good comedy with just a little bite thanks to its sharp dialogue and strong casting. There are many missed opportunities to offer a more scathing statement on the fashion industry, but its focus on vain people with self-importance issues does hit several high notes."

","Now this movie wouldn't normally be one I'd pick out of the movie rental store by myself, but my parents picked it up and I was nonetheless inclined to watch it because it looked decent enough. For all the insight (realistic and I'm guessing exaggerated) into the world of fashion that the movie offers, one can see the plot outline a mile away: Girl wants the promising job, girl gets the promising job, girl realizes she must sacrifice social ties to advance in the job, and girl ultimately decides her friends and romantic relationship are more important. Despite this one, however, substantial gripe, the movie did keep my attention and had some clever one-liners. Miranda Priestly (played by Meryl Streep) was the best character by far, and more or less carries the movie in my opinion (okay, I guess there are two gripes). Not a groundbreaking title, and certainly not one I need to see again, but there are worse ways to spend 109 minutes of your life, which, in the end, isn't saying too much."

In her role here as difficult fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly she shows us once again why she is among a rare few who are the best in the business.<br/><br/>But the story is really about young and smart Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) from the midwest, who turned down a chance to study law at Stanford for the lure of journalism in NYC. She is interviewed for a job as an assistant to Miranda, without even knowing who Miranda is. There is nothing about her fashion sense (none) that would make her right for this job, but Miranda hires her anyway, not happy with he last few.<br/><br/>Brit Emily Blunt plays Emily, Miranda's other assistant. Many refer to this movie as a comedy, but it really isn't. Oh, there are many funny things in it, but it really is more a serious look at the fashion industry, and how a young woman 'comes of age' in this difficult situation.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. Andy eventually begins to dress the part, and with her strong desire to prove Miranda wrong does everything she can to be the best. Even securing copies of the unpublished manuscript of the next Harry Potter book for Miranda's twin daughters. But her boyfriends and other friends take a back seat and relationships suffer. Andy finally realizes what is important, walks away from Miranda and the fashion industry, and gets a job with a newspaper.

But after it was over it was a decent movie, but left me confused as to its point in the end. The moral was scattered about and permeated with her sleeping around, which eventually amounted to something inconsequential, which then seemed illogical. The parts where she was at work was enjoyable, but every time she walked out it turned into a badly written soap opera, with a boyfriend you're not sure if you're supposed to like or hate, because he comes off annoying and lazy. So by the end, you're wondering what was accomplished through the whole thing. Sure, there is a bit of light there at the conclusion, but up to that point the story seems to have mixed feelings, and confuses the viewer. The movie was decent, and mildly entertaining, but don't look for anything profound in it."

She gets a job interview for the assistant of the chief editor, Miranda, of ""Runway"". Having no sense and knowledge of fashion, Andy is unexpectedly hired by Miranda, which later changes her life. The difficult job forces her to learn to survive, but also transforms her into another Andy.<br/><br/>There's no wonder why a girl who has her own dream can be fooled by the reality as she's just too ""fresh"" to the real world. She is first tempted by the idea that ""after a year as Miranda's assistant, you can get whatever job you want"". This must be very attractive to many fresh graduates as nowadays it's getting harder to make what you want to do a living. This more or less reflects the real world and also fresh graduates' feelings.<br/><br/>As the story goes, you'll see rather loose, or boring, development of the story flooded with clothes in a lively way, and this is what my female friends find amazing about the film.<br/><br/>It's not unusual to see everyday examples of mistaking what others want as what you want, just like what Andy does. At last Andy does make a choice that I find uneasy and expected. Maybe it's better to have a happier ending anyway.<br/><br/>The whole film is like an examination to Andy, with Miranda as the examiner. Miranda's image as the devil is ruined by the reference she writes as I suppose the devil will never give you any rewards. But this role can be regarded as Meryl Streep's showcase for her ability to handle different kinds of roles. Anne Hathaway proves herself to have much potential and yet she still needs to polish up her acting.<br/><br/>I've seen not a few films of this kind and I would say this is one of the good ones. It would be better if the film can be shortened and focus more on the inner side of Andy."

I'm giving it an 8, just because it was quite fun to watch, and I think THAT is what movies should be about - just to relax :) I didn't like the very beginning though - I felt like I was watching some kind of a commercial..and I have a phobia for that, lol.

She is truly a acting god<br/><br/>Though she had less screen time than ""Princess"" Anne Hathway the movie is Meryl Streep. The supporting cast includes Stanley Tucci and Emily Blunt who deliver creditable performances.Blunt(who i have never seen before) is incredibly funny as the snooty 1st assistant to Streep and her scenes with Hathway are really funny.The movie was directed really well and is one of the stylish films I have seen and has set fashion trends all over the world.

","I've never seen Simon Baker play the same accent twice, but this time was downright weird. He seemed to be channeling Matthew Broderick, and if you close your eyes, the impersonation is uncanny. But to what purpose? To make his character seem wimpy and harmless? Why not play those qualities as a character trait instead of a send-up? An inside joke may be afoot.<br/><br/>The director of ""The Devil Wear Prada"" is a vet of Sex and the City, and directed a first feature starring Sarah Jessica Parker, ""Miami Rhapsody."" Mrs. Broderick may have suggested the directorial tactic, or maybe it was a fond tribute in its own right. But for the audience, it was distracting. And it robbed us from what Mr. Baker might've done.<br/><br/>No matter. What we came to see was Meryl Streep deliver one of her richest roles in years. Funny, dangerous, cruel, sad.

","In the 80's ""Working Girl"", the heroine worked beyond the call of duty and triumphed despite her dragon boss.

Here, faced with the same success, our 00's girl says ""No, that's not me"" and rejects the non-life of the super-successful. Is this perhaps a healthier message?<br/><br/>Otherwise, an enjoyable movie thanks mainly to Streep and Tucci - without whom it would have been another in the Princess Diaries franchise. A bit of a step-back for Hathaway after breaking away in ""Brokeback Mountain"", I'd have thought, though it was fun to see the film-makers style her as an Audrey Hepburn in the Paris scenes.

After years of trying to shake her somewhat dowdy and severe image as an actress through various comedy misfires, she proves she can truly nail a comic lead by turning in a performance at once so effortless and so refined as Anna Wintour's wardrobe. Streep, as Priestley, incidentally is turned out like Cruella De Ville at a Versace fire sale.<br/><br/>It is in achieving this flawless level of studied hauteur and languid disdain as Miranda Priestley in delivering every sentence and every withering look as 'Runway''s iconic Editor-in-Chief, that will see Streep take her place on a pedestal along Bette, Liza, Barbara and Faye, and see Miranda Priestley ascend to the pantheon of great camp characters.<br/><br/>Everything else pales. The other leads are there to accessorize, which they do dutifully and with the minimum of distraction. Hathaway's character wrestles with her work ethic, her sanity, her common decency and the desire to 'get on' and at its most serious level 'The Devil..' is a study on how psychological and emotional manipulation can be so skilfully brought to bear to make someone surrender their free will : Andrea initially believes her bid to conform and impress Miranda, in some way, a challenge to her boss, likely to 'prove' herself, whereas it is very much just part of the process of moral capitulation that begins 'when you put on that first pair of Jimmy Choos'."
"johnmbale","9","0","1","26 September 2006"," Meryl Streep is on a Winner.
","Meryl Streep must be on a roll at the moment getting better with age, her more mature parts pay off in two excellent recent pictures A Prairie Home Companion, directed by Robert Altman and this light hearted expose of the high fashion industry directed by David Frankel. There is a old connection with Altman in another way too, he also did a marvelous job with high fashion a few years back in Pret-a-Porter (1994) <br/><br/>Streep is the cement that holds the film together in this case. She is just terrific as the ice queen running the prestigious fashion magazine, sails through the part seamlessly as if it was written for her. Briefly the plot concerns young Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) longing to be a journalist but manages to secure almost accidentally the highly sought after position as personal assistant to fashion guru Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) the high powered editor from hell of ""Runway"" magazine. Miranda is a real cool dragon lady who frightens the pants off people. <br/><br/>Andy seems a total misfit wearing (as someone rudely points out) Opportunity Shop ensembles, has a voice like one of the Chip Monks (if you remember them) with no acquaintance of mid Atlantic diction, and appears oblivious to the prestige of her office. But she's a lovely girl at heart and has a lovely live in boyfriend. <br/><br/>But this is shortly to change under the guidance of supercilious Nigel the camp fashion coordinator, a wonderful portrayal by Stanley Tucci. Andy dons a festoon of fashion labels beyond belief and with some Liza Minnelli eye makeup, before you can say ""Donatella Versace"" becomes one of the ""in"" team, looking suitably chic despite being put upon to do an enormous often menial workload. This sets Andy apart from her old crowd and boyfriend, whilst her curious relationship with the dragon lady would appear to have life changing possibilities, in the process Andy tarnishes her integrity and looks like losing her man. It all comes to head when Andy gets invited to accompany the great Miranda to Paris for the major showing. Yet finally everything is suitably resolved in the heart warming conclusion that bears out ""all that glitters is not gold"". <br/><br/>Based on the novel by Lauren Weisberger who worked for Vogue magazine for twelve months and obviously uses some of her experiences of that year in the book. She says that in fashion nothing is impossible, that doesn't even come into the language. Certainly it's the basic premise in the film too, even getting the goods on Harry Potter is not beyond the pale in this fickle land of fads. <br/><br/>This is an entertaining mix of drama and comedy with much appeal to women in the audience. It captures the glitz and glamour of an industry which continues to fascinate mere mortals who can but only read the glossy magazines."
"Chris_Docker","8","0","1","21 September 2006"," When a 6 is the new 14
","Meryl Streep has complained that there are not enough deeply committed roles for women her age, and effectively she is reduced to playing heartless old women. But if The Devil Wears Prada is anything to go by, it is a refreshing opportunity for Streep to reinvent herself, in a style that has a light surety of touch without the embarrassing lingering 'Oscar-worthy' moments that had become almost a cliché of her older films.<br/><br/>Streep plays Miranda Priestly, the head of a fashion magazine called Runway which is the approximate equivalent to Vogue. Not only is the setting convincing (with several real life top models), but this witty, light-hearted comedy is casually decorated with everything from Prada and Galliano to an especially designed Valentino dress (Valentino has a small cameo as himself) and Chanel's 2006 couture collection made available exclusively for the film.<br/><br/>Meet Anne Hathaway (Brokeback Mountain) as Andy, a bright young graduate and would-be journalist. Struggling to get a job in her chosen career, she applies to work at Runway  a magazine she doesn't read, run by a grande dame of the fashion world she's never heard of and who is guarded by career-minded Emily. She is, in the words of Runway's fashion director, a 'sad little person'. She has a job a million girls would kill for, doesn't realise it, and looks totally out of place. Her boyfriend jokes that it must have been a telephone interview.<br/><br/>You could be forgiven for thinking this was going to be a re-working of Working Girl, where the brains and flair of a dumb junior win the day, yet The Devil Wears Prada is neither as slapstick nor as simplistic as the earlier hit. Streep is an ogre, but not a bad one, just supercharged, brilliant at her job, and something of a legend. Anne Hathaway, on the other hand, wears smart clothes from cheap shops  at least until she gets the predictable make-over  and her head and heart is lured by fashion rather than finding their life-goal knee deep in Jimmy Choo boots. Avoiding the devil is not so much about who and what but about being true to yourself. Possibly not since Funny Face, the Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire classic, have the irresistible dynamics of the fashion world been so glamorously, temptingly and captivatingly portrayed.<br/><br/>Director David Frankel is better known for several episodes of Sex and the City, and here carries that show's flair for believability of New York's fast movers to new heights. The script has so many cuttingly funny one-liners that you never get a moment to notice it has very little depth. Acting and characterisation is first class, there's a great soundtrack that always seems in perfect keeping with the plot, and the page-perfect ending is neither cheesy nor trite. Streep's greatest moment is perhaps the time we see her without make-up, going through a difficult personal time, but it is still an ensemble performance with the other two leads, something that has served her well ever since her remarkable triple billing in The Hours.<br/><br/>It is an image of power and materialism that has no bad guys  or women - only ones that want to get to the top. Director David Frankel comments that fashion ""is a constant pursuit for reinvention. It's both what's so great and so awful about fashion. For fashion to succeed, it has to make all of us feel that everything we have and wear is inadequate."" This battle of the glamazons takes no prisoners, and even Andy's scoffing friends are mesmerised when she hands out cast-off designer goods. Faust has never looked so good. As for Andy, we are kept guessing whether she sold her soul the day she put on her first pair of Jimmy Choos."

"dredyoung","10","0","1","28 July 2006"," Devil Wears Prada: A portrait, a veritable parable, of modern America!
","""The 'Devil' Wears Prada"" and the Flies the Most Glamorous and Formidable Jet Fighters I went to see ""The Devil Wears Prada"" this afternoon. It was very good, very entertaining. Mainly and initially I was interested in the psychology of the fashion world. Of course, I knew pretty much about this already because TV is saturated with it. Also, I had a woman friend, really two in fact, in Dallas who were involved in its Fashion Mart during the seventies and eighties and told me a lot about it. It is a ruthlessly competitive world. Everyone in it plays the game and plays to the status cravings of everyone else. This drive combines with the uncanny ability to cast a bigger spell, a more compelling mystic, and to be more convincing in presenting one's creations than one's rivals. Nevertheless, this drive propels these fashion gladiators to use stealthy throat cutting, back stabbing. Since they cannot be blatant with their unprincipled competition, they resort to Machiavellian deviousness, manipulation, and sabotaging. The tautness of these opposites of stylishness and ruthlessness can result in implosive stress. It can also result in beastly mutual psychological ruination, especially among their insufficiently calloused underlings. All the while they must learn to be coyly dedicated to setting the stage for ripping off obeisant devotees in a conspicuous consumption contest. The game, like all sports, is infectious. Now, an unexpected stage is set for a different set of incompatibilities. Enter a young, beautiful, brilliant, ambitious college graduate with bountiful belief in herself, self acceptance, empathy, and having that crucial element of worldly innocence. Wham! 'Classical' American wholesome meets 'modern' American superficial, frenzied, duplicitous, and winner takes all fashion society. Just that tad of ambition in her is enough to seduce her into this alien whirlwind. At first blush of le style d'un moderne in her appearance, her friends suspect an incipient seduction in the making. She resents their hints that she will inevitably succumb to Siren's beguile. The dizzying aura and commanding magnetism of her boss, challenging her capabilities, ensnares her and she takes up the gauntlet. Bit by bit she forces herself to learn to garner admiration and envy in the glamor game until, seduction almost complete, she is on the brink of becoming the person she initially reviled, her boss. At this moment of truth the submerged wholesome girl emerges with its fill of repressed revulsion bursting out. Her epiphany is grasping the toll on her idealistic soul of this mischievous and counterfeit fashion rat race. Among their not so fortunate and unwary clientèles, on the other hand, the enticement of this fashion world everlastingly and irresistibly sets off ever so subtle but nonetheless horribly loathsome, invidious comparisons and wretchedly demeaning rivalries. Yet, these fawning patrons persist in following religiously. For, in the end, the fashion world could not exist without this dynamic. This is psychological Darwinianism at its pinnacle of calculated maliciousness. Only the most hardhearted, ruthless, cunning cutthroats among the would-be fashion titans survive and ascend. Those who relish being, have the talent, and can convey that special air of ultimate authority as trend setter rise to and endure at the top as high priestesses and nigh sacred icons of the business. These people draw money capitals to their door and can cause currencies to course around the planet. These fashion moguls reap fortunes off the shallow envy of the appearance junkies which they create. With their diamonds and sapphires dangling, they thrive on the wasted heaps of glitter and rhinestone style-mongering idiots who bankrupt themselves while trying to keep up with the latest and most sheik creations from these artists in the craft of facade. But, if you want an understanding of the heart of American culture, here is where you will find it. Ironically, one can apply this same description, this same socio-psychology, to our defense industry, military leaders, politicians, lobbyists, academicians, professionals of all types, and yes even our clergy, and, woefully, you and I, along with the rest of our fellow Americans. Americans are status junkies who believe in one manifestation or another of this competitiveness and ambition for status, power, wealth, and fame, as though 'it' were the ultimate religion. Sadly, however, it is not just winning but is also beating, and defeating any and all comers, that is the prize we seek. Toward this 'holy' end, any means you can get away with is justified. Defeat of and one-upping one's rivals, and even one's friends, is the true religion of Americans. Adhering to the good old American sportsmanship code is necessary, outwardly, of course. Doing this, as winners, must be done not too gleefully and with grace and a barely detectable, demurely condescending, contempt for the losers. This art is also a major requirement in this religion. 'A spoonful of insipid, sugary diplomacy may help the 'poison' go down'. Of course, one must learn to keep one's disdain for the losers inconspicuous, somewhat like a genteel, beneficent serial killer, a Dr. Hannibal Lectern in lace, if you will. One must, however, be a true believer in the arts of this uniquely indigenous religion. Furthermore, one must be true to that religion even if it means destroying the hearts and values of masses of fellow humans and ultimately, in the process, results in consuming and destroying the earth. These hyenas of the fashion jungle, whether in the world of adornment, or any other industry, cannot just momentarily stop their ravenous quest for dominance, victory, or stardom long enough to take stock of themselves or to consider the futility of their addiction and its awful consequences on the hearts and souls of their victims, and the health of the earth as well, while doing so. After all, being number one is all that matters! And everyone, as Miranda so heroically and gallantly says, just before the movie's curtain time, ""That's silly. Everyone wants to be us."" Yes, deep down, everyone wants to be the envy of everyone, right?"
"emporter","4","0","1","17 July 2006"," Not enough plot, bad parallel
","This movie had potential but lacked in plot. It was certainly obvious what was going to happen from the beginning, however, we watch movies like this to see how the end is reached. A good movie will reach that end in an interesting fashion. This movie, however, did not. At a key point in the movie Andy, the main character, had to choose between furthering her own career and hurting Emily's, her co-worker. This was then later paralleled to Miranda's furthering of her career by hurting Nigel's. This is not parallel in any way. Unlike Nigel's relationship with Miranda, Emily had been nothing but nasty to Andy and Andy therefore owed her nothing. Also, even if Andy chose not to further her own career by going to Paris with Miranda, there's no saying whether or not Miranda would have still left Emily in New York--meaning the outcome could very well have been the same for Emily no matter what. That decision was made into a key decision--while it wasn't a key decision at all. It would have made more sense had Miranda asked Andy to cheat on her completely innocent and likable boyfriend by sleeping with someone else to further her career. Then that would have been a true choice between what's more important in life."
"johnnymonsarrat","7","0","1","12 July 2006"," Jon Monsarrat review: slightly disappointing, but message could change your life
","The Devil wears Prada contains few surprises. Obviously, it's a coming of age story where a young innocent encounters an abusive boss and has to decide how to react.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the acting is good, especially by Meryl Streep who simply shines in the film. There is one scene where Meryl's character forgets her makeup and it's immediately shocking.<br/><br/>However, the story is a slow-paced and predictable. The love interest doesn't have much to do (for once it's a male, usually women get stuck with this). It's a little silly to cast Anne Hathaway as the ""fat awkward girl"" since she's already beautiful and shining before her transformation into a fashionista. There's nothing fat or awkward about this actress.<br/><br/>The largest two flaws in the film were, for me, first (and this is not spoiling anything) the temptations of the young innocent becoming just like her boss... it didn't come across to me viscerally. Characters would comment that Andi was becoming just like her boss, shallow and kind of evil, but I don't know, it didn't work for me.<br/><br/>The second flaw was that the boss just didn't seem evil enough to me. Verbally abusive, nasty, unfair in judgment... this is rare enough to spark the interest? Now the boss in Working Girls, she was evil. And without spoiling anything, I can tell you that at one point in the film the Meryl Streep character does seem to have a heart. Which sort of broke the idea of the film for me, i.e. rejecting this person's personality.<br/><br/>Finally, despite all these comments, I really liked the message of the film. The primary message seemed to be that over-investing in a relationship for future rewards (working for a cruel boss hoping that she'll promote you to greatness) can be foolish. A secondary message is that it's easy when working closely with a dominating personality to blame yourself for silly stuff that isn't your fault. I think everyone's had a family, romantic, or business relationship with a continual complainer and it's hard not to let that get under your skin. Emerging from this and realizing ""Hey I'm OK!"" is a great message. This second theme is slightly lost in the film (you have to piece it together yourself).<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- If you are currently in any kind of dominating relationship and need to get a backbone and get out of it.<br/><br/>-- Egotistical fashionistas who will end up excusing the boss's abusiveness because ""she's just trying to get ahead"". Heck with ya.<br/><br/>-- Anyone interested in the world of fashion Everyone else, you are OK to skip it without much regret. I'll give The Devil Wears Prada a 7 out of 10 because it was slightly boring, but could potentially change your life."

","Perhaps my hopes were too high? What with a winning combination of a great book and the likes of Meryl Streep, one of the best actresses EVER, I thought this movie would be incredible. Not so much.<br/><br/>Bottom line - if I had not read the book I think I would have enjoyed the movie a lot more. Outside of the general premise of the book, all of the supplementary plots were either non-existent or altered dramatically - not sure why? A somewhat disappointing adaptation I would say. The book was greatloved the book  uncluttered, great character and plot development, etc. The same cannot be said of the movie. Miranda (Streep) can do no wrong in any role she chooses, but Andrea (Hathaway) was marginal. The clothing and accessories were to-die for! But alas, fashion and Streep cannot make an entire movie.<br/><br/>Therefore, my take on this flick is that you will find the movie amusing if you have not read the book and will likely find the movie somewhat disappointing if you have."

","I have no idea what happened to this movie. Amazingly, director David Frankel turns what could have been simply a fun summer movie, into a brilliantly realized critique on today's fashion society. Not only has he propelled it to the top of the heap of summer films, he transcends them and gives us one of the best movies I have seen in years.<br/><br/>The Devil Wears Prada follows a struggling journalist, Andy Sachs, through her experience working at the fashion magazine Runway. The only problem is, Andy has zero fashion sense, and the Editor-In-Chief, Miranda Priestly is from hell (not literally). So, in typical comedy fashion, Andy must rise to the occasion, learn her lesson about life, and be a better person. The reason this tired plot works so well, is the tongue-in-cheek way the film approaches it. It's as if the creators are winking at you, making fun of that cliché. And the dialog for this movie is absolutely wonderful. It's very reminiscent of the brilliant energy of Gilmore Girls.<br/><br/>Where The Devil Wears Prada shines the brightest, however, is the acting. No movie this year has even been in the same league. Anne Hathaway, who has shown herself to be one darn good actress, is excellent as Andy Sachs. Like everything about this movie, she takes what could have been ordinary and boring, and does something incredible with it. She takes the clichéd role of ""hero"" and gives a believable, and at times, chilling performance. Plus, when you're able to stand next to Meryl Streep as an actress, you've accomplished something extraordinary. And ah, Meryl it's not unusual for Meryl Streep to be excellent in a movie, but WOW! At one point during the movie, my mouth fell open and I gasped at how incredible she was. It would have been so easy to propel Miranda Priestly into characture land, but she doesn't. In fact, she does quite the opposite. She takes the boss from hell role, and gives it fathoms of depth. At two points in the movie, she lets her character's guard down, and those moments, like I said, are jaw dropping. I can't put into words how amazing she is, you just have to see it.<br/><br/>I don't normally gush over a movie like this, but I can't help myself. Everything about this movie works so well. The cinematography is very clever. It's nothing astounding, but it fits the personality of this movie exactly. The music is wonderful too. Kudos, guys. You had me dancing in the theater; that's how good it was. And you cannot talk about The Devil Wears Prada without mentioning the clothes. They're excellent and paint a very accurate picture of modern fashion. Meryl Streep's wardrobe, in particular, is magnificent. Full of regal coats and furs, she looks simply stunning. And the transformation they work on Anne Hathaway is very good. To see her go from ordinary and bland, to chic and sexy is incredibly entertaining.<br/><br/>Why The Devil Wears Prada works so well, is it's class. It has more class than all of the 2006 movies combined. This film is just brimming with personality. It's little touches like Andy's job hanging on her getting the unpublished manuscript of Harry Potter for Miranda's kids. Or everyone at the office calling her by her dress size ""6"".<br/><br/>While I have sufficiently praised this movie, as with everything else, nothing is perfect. Even though the movie does make fun of clichéd stories throughout, the ending still ties things up a little too neatly. But at the end, you really won't care. The ride has been so fun, to nitpick and say the ending could have been a touch better, is to ruin something great.<br/><br/>All in all, The Devil Wears Prada is not to be missed by anyone. It's a brilliant, fun film, that transcends genre and becomes something very special. Most will probably say ""This isn't for me at all."" Give it a try. You shouldn't miss this incredible movie, whether you can tell Gucci from Gabbana at a glance, or can't tell Prada from Payless."
"mitchbear","9","0","1","8 July 2006"," Will this film be headed for Sit-com land?
","Just saw this very entertaining film tonight. I was a little reluctant going in, but glad I saw it. I began to think, that some where along the line, Fox might develop into a series for Television. Think about it all the elements of a typical television series that will work, and who knows, if it works it might become a hit series. But of course with different actors. I don't think Meryl Streep will not do a television series. ......What do you think? Can someone think of appropriate Televiaion actors who might fill the shoes of the principals of the film? Will the series still have the tone of the original motion pictures?"
"geraldclare","6","0","1","6 July 2006"," What was that? Romantic, No, Comedic, barely
","Hello Moviegoers, The Devil Wears Prada looks so promising in the trailer. You think you're gonna get this smart sophisticated movie with lots of bitchy one liners.<br/><br/>Well, what you really get is an insipid movie about a young womans angst regarding how much of a sell-out to be to forward her career. <br/><br/>Ann Hathaway is the young woman with the career problems, coulda' been any attractive young actress. Meryl Streep is a terrific comic actress, loved her in Death Becomes Her, sadly Prada is not her movie, it's Hathaways. Stanley Tucci is reliably excellent, but here isn't given much to do except flounce around.<br/><br/>I thought it was gonna be a comedy, and there ARE four or five good laughs. It's not even a romantic comedy, what romance there is is pitifully anemic.<br/><br/>I oughta rate movies according to how many times I check my watch. This one was about a six, meaning, ""When will The Devil Wears Prada disappear in a puff of smoke and let me outa here?<br/><br/>This is KPYG<br/><br/>This is 1340 KYNS"

","I thought the movie was all out awesome best I've seen in awhile the acting was amazing and the story line couldn't have been any better its a movie for all people age 12+ take as many people to see it with u cause u don't wanna miss it I'm glad i paid the 12$ to see it in the theater and it one of those movies ill pay30$ to buy it the week it comes out... the lake house rocks to .5 of a star more the the devil that wears Pravda and apparently i have to write more to make its comment eligible too well the devil who wears Pravda has what is a surprise twist to it u think it all gonna be about making it in the fashion business but it much more about a girl who takes risk in the crowd she doesn't belong in and I'm sure a lot of us can compare to that. but the story line almost had me in tears but just in time it had a excellent ending i hope you all enjoyed it as much as i did and if u didn't well I'm sorry for making it seem so great"

","I love Meryl. I think she is the best actor around. This movie was fine. Although I think you will appreciate it more if you catch on HBO on a Saturday afternoon rather than paying $10 for it. There is a little too much story and not enough comedy. I missed the coffee scene in the trailer. That was funny. I think the character of Andy ""got it"" too quickly. There aren't enough scenes of her freaking out to impossible requests and when she ""turns"" she doesn't do anything really crazy so her redemption doesn't hit home. The film looks great. It's all very Sex and the City. It just doesn't go far enough for an adult audience."
"NRGDude","Null","0","1","4 July 2006"," A major disappointment
","Ann, Meryl and the rest of the cast gave excellent performances but the story fell flat due to the way the supporting characters were written. Friends don't abandon you as quickly as Andy's friends did in this movie. Add to that the pure cold-heartedness of Miranda and Andy is left floundering in a sea of nastiness. People like to identify with characters in movies but this movie failed in that area.<br/><br/>While I wasn't expecting a sugar-coated Disney feature, I was looking forward to an entertaining movie with some laughs. Instead, I spent most of the movie wondering why Ann's character even bothered to stay one day at that abusive job. Don't waste your money on this one."
"b_heiges","10","0","1","3 July 2006"," I give it 10 stars!!
","The movie was SO VERY INTRIGUING! It related to that person in the business whose main priority is work and not only tries to be successful but is. And in those lives there are ups and downs and rights and wrongs and you cant get around it. You have to make decisions, and not everyone is going to like them, but in the end its what you want. I have never seen a movie depict a life so perfectly. What I found captivating, is that I didn't know which way I wanted her to go. I couldn't figure out if She should move on to a new life and a new her or if she should stick to what is comfortable, the past. I know what is popular demand but I also, in her shoes would have gone with the success. SO I was torn and that is why I fell in love with this movie."
"maccaveili","9","0","1","2 July 2006"," Guys, this is a date movie, not bad but wait for the rental
","Speaking from the guy perspective, this is definitely a movie you will only watch with a woman. With that being said though, it's not really a romance movie, not that it doesn't involve any relationship stuff, but trust me, you and the guys won't be staying home on a Friday night to watch this. If though, you're attached to the ball and chain on said Friday night, and it's out on rental, by all means, you could do worse if you're staying in for a movie. It's actually kind of funny, and the lead actress is worth looking at for an hour and a half. However, I saw it in a theater, that's right, I'm married. It's a very intense movie as far as the levels of stress that the poor girl is going through at her new job as a fresh college graduate. I actually found myself feeling stressed out, thinking that if I ever had a job like that, I'd probably implode. So it actually made things go by quickly, I mean I wasn't looking at my watch much, and the wife was happy, so it was worth it in that regard. I gave it a 9 based on the fact that if you have to please your woman with a date flick, then with all things being considered, it's really not that bad. And I'm your typical all American sports loving guy, so that's really saying something for me. But if by any means you can put it off until it comes out for home rental, I'd say save yourself the money and do that.<br/><br/>Macc"
