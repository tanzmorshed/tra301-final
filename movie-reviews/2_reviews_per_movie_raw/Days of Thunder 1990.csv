"Bryan-15","7","44","54","7 September 1998"," Cruise goes with what works
","This movie is basically paying homage to Top Gun.  The same team that made that movie a success got together to create another pumped up movie. <br/><br/>
Cruise plays Cole Trickle, a very cocky and smooth indy car driver that lost his ride and decided to head to NASCAR with team owner Tim Daland,(Randy Quaid), and be coached by legendary crew chief Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall). During the Daytona 500 Cole and nemesis Rowdy Burns are involved in a nasty wreck that hospitalizes both of them and threaten to end their careers.  They become friends but Cole realizes his mortality and must overcome it if he is to ever race effectively again. <br/><br/>This has better romantic chemistry than Top Gun.  Due in part to the fact that Cruise and Kidman really were attracted to each other and we know the rest is history.  The action scenes are great and filmed superbly.  It's also a very loud movie.  It received an Oscar nomination for best sound. It's just another mindless action movie to help relieve boredom.  7 out of 10."
"LuboLarsson","6","26","31","12 February 2007"," I feel the need, the need for Speed
","The producers, director and star of Top Gun get together again for this above average racing drama. Its nowhere near as good as Top Gun of course but its no disaster. Tom Cruise is good as the daftly named racing driver Cole Trickle and the ever reliable Robert Duvall offers classy support. Michael Rooker is excellent as Toms rival and Randy Quaid shows a more serious side to those who only know him from the Vacation movies. Surprisingly the usually good Nicole Kidman is rather bland as the love interest although to be fair she's not given a heck of a lot to work with. The music is of course all important in a movie like this and it has a pretty good soundtrack including Maria McKee's Number One hit Show Me Heaven, but again Top Gun had a much better soundtrack with Hans Zimmmer no match for Harold Faltermeyer. Tony Scott directs with his usual style, if you have seen Top Gun or Beverly Hills Cop 2 you'll no what to expect, very flashy and VERY LOUD. With a slightly less predictable story this could have been a lot better but as it is its a pretty enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours."
"xwhenseasonschangex","8","30","37","23 January 2007"," By all standards I shouldn't enjoy this movie.....
","First of all this movie has Tom Cruise in it, which to be honest is the reason that I hesitated for so long to see it. Secondly It's about NASCAR for Christ's sake! The problem is, I did enjoy it. I believe its for the reasons that I mentioned that I actually did enjoy it. An escapist sort of entertainment that puts you in a place that you would really never even consider going. I was forced to rent this recently by a friend and after sitting about 15 minutes in to it I just let go and let the colors and sounds wash over me. This movie is the visual equivalent of a music video with dialog. Every scene is short and to the point, and if its forward momentum you are looking for in your movies then you've come to the right place. The entire duration of the movies length I kept thinking that I wish there were more movies made that took you to another world the way this one does. Tony Scott you've done it again sir, Congratulations!"

","-SMALL SPOILERS-<br/><br/>I was a NASCAR fan before this movie came out, and I still am. This is an enjoyable movie that (somewhat) accurately portrays the on-track action I watch on Sundays. To be honest, I didn't care that much about who was in it or the plot that it had, I was in it for the racing from the beginning. The actors and writing hold it together and, from a fan's perspective, the racing is great, although the cars are incredibly tough and drive all over the walls and each other, something you can't do in a real race. Still, the racing stays true to life and, with one exception, the cars remain on the ground. They don't seem to be on the moon or some other zero-gravity environment like in DRIVEN. If you're a fan of NASCAR, you'll love this movie."
"MrKearns-2","8","62","84","2 November 1999"," Say what you will, but this is a great movie for guys.
","Regardless of your opinion of NASCAR racing, this is an incredibly fun movie for guys.<br/><br/>Is it creative? No. It's pretty obvious that it's the same thing as Top Gun. The only difference is maturity. Over the years, Tom Cruise had developed into a fine actor, and when coupled with Robert Duvall (in a spectacular performance) and a surprising Randy Quaid, Days of Thunder becomes a film which gets pretty much any guy involved in it.<br/><br/>I personally hate NASCAR, but still I find this film absolutely riveting, and every time I watch it, I suddenly have a desire to go race my car down the highway. In fact, the biggest argument against this movie is that it does get to the testosterone.<br/><br/>The music for Days of Thunder sets it up perfectly. Hans Zimmer does an effective job with his second Cruise film in two years (Rain Man was the other), and The Spencer Davis Group's Gimme Some Lovin' makes some plotless racing scenes worth watching.<br/><br/>The script, penned by Bob Towne, is far more clever than the average action movie and actually creates some serious character depth for Cole and Rowdy, although Cary Elwes' character seems excessively evil.<br/><br/>But, all in all, this is an action movie that works for Cruise fans, even if they don't like action movies. 8.5 out of 10 (On a pure enjoyment basis)."
"michaelRokeefe","7","10","11","5 March 2007"," On the racetrack, he has all the right moves.
","A very good Tom Cruise action flick; and talk about action...he has the right moves on and off the track. Cruise plays Cole Trickle, an arrogant hotshot with minimum experience driving a stock car, but an uncanny ability to hold his own on the track. He impresses a two-faced Randy Quaid enough to get a car and veteran driver Robert Duvall to build it. Trickle enters a rivalry with the top driver(Michael Rooker), but tragedy introduces him to self-discovery and a beautiful neurosurgeon(Nicole Kidman). Trickle takes on the toughest odds and becomes an even better driver. Also in the cast: Cary Elwes, Fred Dalton Thompson and John C. Reilly. The racing scenes will bring back that feeling evoked by TOP GUN. A hard thumping soundtrack features the likes of: Joan Jett, Elton John, Chicago, Tina Turner and Maria McKee. And yes, it is hard not to notice the Cruise/Kidman chemistry."
"rupak_speaking","6","7","8","19 February 2018"," On The Borderline of 'Watchability'
","I saw Rush (2013) and then I saw Days of Thunder (1990), and the result is obvious, lame. The chemistry between the racer and his car maker/crew chief, with his girl Kidman, with his rival, Cruise's charm, nothing really captivates. Apart from the racing scenes, hardly anything to catch your eye, an overall drab affair, a racing fan may just pass through this and for that I give it a generous 6."
"Quinoa1984","6","7","8","26 July 2015"," some good Towne-script moments and a superb cast, but...
","Yeah, Top Gun is the one that made all the very BIG bucks back in 1986 and put Tony Scott and Tom Cruise on the map in bigger ways then they had been before (not to mention producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer), but somehow, much as with De Palma/Pacino with Scarface and Carlito's Way, the follow-up seemed to probably be the actual better film of the two. Does this mean that Days of Thunder, following the travails of an up-and-comer racecar star (Cruise), is a really good movie? Well, in some ways yes, and in other ways not so much.<br/><br/>I give the production this: it moves fast and slick, and whenever cars are on the track it's visually compelling and exciting as the filmmakers know how to cut stuff together for Fast Impact (lest not forget the camera-work, filled with colors and smoke and cool contours, even a shot with Nicole Kidman standing at one point on the side of the frame is great to look at). And the casting here is fantastic; and forget Cruise, how about Robert Duvall (has he ever been anything less than solid, and here he's actually giving this conventional Trainer-cum-Mentor some soul), or Nicole Kidman (who gets really some of the best lines in the film), or Michael Rooker (by now something of an underrated character actor national treasure, and here imbuing an a-hole with a lot of sympathy and pathos)? Why not throw in John C. Reilly in there too, he has a couple of memorable moments too.<br/><br/>Where it flails? Sadly, and I'm not sure if this is really on Towne's end - and one should note that Cruise has his only (?) writing credit here as co-story author - or the producers, but this all the same is light-weight stuff. There's not much conflict to the proceedings, or much that sticks to the gravel, no pun intended (OK, some). This is the kind of movie that gives people like Duvall some excellent scenes to at least try to overcome the clich√©s of the sports movie (and make no mistake, that's what this is deep down, and a ""programmer"" of the old-time-studio variety, not a terrible thing inherently)... and then you got Cary Elwes as ""Russ Wheeler"". The last time one saw a motorist with the last name Wheeler was in a Disney Goofy cartoon about Motor Madness. And Randy Quaid, who is OK, also is saddled with some very basic material to work with here as the businessman who turns on a dime. There may be some stakes, like for Rooker's character, yet for Cruise there's not much there that makes it feel like 'Oh no, s***'s getting real here!' <br/><br/>In other words, Days of Thunder has some genuinely good stuff to it, and it has some personality and verve and, for a couple of moments, sex appeal in that, uh, late 80's/early 90's style (and hey, this was the movie Cruise and Kidman met after all, so you can see the chemistry as white hot as they come). But it's hard not to eye-roll at some of the story choices and character motivations, or things like, say, the movie ending on an unironic freeze frame at a very silly moment. <br/><br/>It's one of those things where I give it a tepid recommendation and/or a very strong put-down, if that makes sense. Quality, dumb-studio filmmaking for the masses - and, for sure, a step up from the waste of Top Gun. 6.5/10"

","Days of Thunder is a film about auto racing.It was directed by Tony Scott.The cast includes Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman,Robert Duvall,Randy Quaid,Cary Elwes and Michael Rooker.<br/><br/>The story is similar to that of Top Gun only this time,the movie involves Cole Trickle,a young stock car driver gets his chance to compete at the top level.He's a talented driver with an arrogant attitude which gets him into trouble not only with other stock car drivers and the members of his own team as well.<br/><br/>Cole Trickle,played by Tom Cruise,is recruited by car dealership tycoon Tim Daland,played by Randy Quaid,to race for his team in NASCAR.He also convinces former crew chief Harry Hogge,played very well by Robert Duvall,to come out of retirement and lead Cole's crew. Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew while being intimidated on the track by NASCAR Winston Cup Champion Rowdy Burns,played by Michael Rooker,that results in Cole not finishing the races,mostly due to crashes or engine blowouts. After discovering that Cole does not understand the common terminology used by NASCAR teams,Harry puts him in a series of rigorous training. This pays off in future races.Aside from that,Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr.Claire Lewicki,played by the gorgeous Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>The story has all the elements of Top Gun.It is predictable and clich√©d from beginning to end.Aside from that,this wasn't exciting as compared to Top Gun despite of having Scott and Cruise involved in it.Days Of Thunders simply felt like a formulaic movie from start to finish with nothing original in it.The same with the characters as well as they were based from Top Gun as well.In the end,if you want to see how elements of Top Gun on wheels,then this movie is it."
"lrparsons","10","13","18","6 May 2010"," Comes on like thunder.
","This is an excellent film about the trials of youth and the power of forgiveness.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's depiction of race car driver Cole Trickle is a spot-on reinterpretation of Orson Welles' character from Citizen Kane. The chemistry between Cruise and costar Michael Rooker is undeniable, and some would say that despite the fact that Cruise actually rooks Rooker, they are both winners in this film.<br/><br/>There is also a very agreeable Rawlsian undertone to the story, channeled through Robert Duvall's character Harry Hogge. Much credit to screenwriter Robert Towne for incorporating such an important philosophical idea in a film that may otherwise have wandered into predictable summer blockbuster territory.<br/><br/>This film comes on your chest like thunder. Go see it immediately."
"Felon-2","10","32","51","22 January 1999"," Days of Thunder is the movie that really got me into racing, if you like Top Gun, you definitely should love Days of Thunder.
","Days of Thunder is definitely my favorite movie of all time.  I'm a huge racing fan and I was very happy when I first heard of this movie back in 1990.  I even went to Hardees and got all the little toy cars.  It's jammed with action and if you like Top Gun, there is no way you can't like this film.  I'm looking to begin racing myself pretty soon and this is what really started it all for me."
"bkoganbing","8","17","25","6 January 2008"," The Need For More Speed
","If I had to guess the genesis for Days of Thunder had its place in two areas. First the fact that Top Gun proved to be such a mega-hit for Tom Cruise that a similar film was almost dictated to be made by Paramount. But secondly it was reported that on the set of The Color of Money, co-star Paul Newman got Cruise interested in auto racing so you put those two things together, Days of Thunder was almost a film that had to be made.<br/><br/>The film certainly has the feel of NASCAR to it and it takes its place along side such racing classics as Grand Prix, The Racers and Paul Newman's own film, Winning. The story is the teaming of young rookie sensation Cruise and top mechanic Robert Duvall. <br/><br/>Tom's character is a whole lot like the young fighter pilot in Top Gun, a kid with a world of confidence and the ability to make his brag become fact. He's a driver by instinct not knowing a whole lot about the mechanics of a racing car. That's the way he and Duvall complement each other although it's not an easy relationship.<br/><br/>Days of Thunder is also the film on which Tom met Mrs. Cruise number two, Nicole Kidman. She's a neurologist who gets to treat Tom after a crash and also drops the hammer on Cruise's rival Michael Rooker and his career after a serious head injury. <br/><br/>There are also some nice performances by Randy Quaid as the stock car owner and Cary Elwes as another of Cruise's rival drivers. <br/><br/>Fred Dalton Thompson, District Attorney of New York County on Law and Order, former United States Senator, and would be President of the United States is in the cast as the head of NASCAR. If the political thing doesn't work out for Fred, he certainly has the presence and authority to be a baseball commissioner. They'll certainly need another Judge Landis in that job to restore some integrity to that sport.<br/><br/>Days of Thunder got an Academy Award nomination for Sound Recording and it's a good followup film for Top Gun."
"msmary","6","10","14","26 May 2009"," Fun Film But Lots of Goofs
","I like NASCAR, and I enjoyed Days of Thunder. The opening sequence at the Daytona 500 gives me goosebumps and makes me want to crank up the surround sound - a homage to NASCAR, the late 80s, and Americana. There were other fun sequences in the movie, like when Cole Trickle is crashing his car every week and when his crew played a prank on him after winning his first race. The movie came out during the height of the ""Tom Cruise is Cool"" era. And, Cruise is cool in this movie. Robert Duvall, who plays his crew chief, is even better in the film.<br/><br/>That said, there were so many errors in this film, it's laughable. The racing shots were taken from real races, and the film editing did a poor job of disguising real race cars (like Dale Earnhardt's No. 3) for fictional ones. The timing is off. There's a scene where Tom Cruise is talking but his lips don't move. There's another scene where a character in the movie calls him Tom instead of Cole - really inexcusable that a error that big was missed. The scenes of cars ramming into one another while leading the race wouldn't be possible in reality: they would wreck or cause too much damage to remain at top speed.<br/><br/>By conventional standards, it's a terrible movie. But, somehow, it's still a fun movie! Action on the race track is similar to the action in the sky in Top Gun. If you're up for a little escapism and wish fulfillment, then Days of Thunder lives up to the billing. But, if you're a critical viewer, you won't be impressed by this film - unless you're looking for ways to laugh at its mistakes."

This movie is very underrated and should be much higher then 5.4 in my opinion!, and i thought Cruise's acting was fantastic!, plus the scene where Rooker asks Cruise to drive his car at Daytona in the hospital room, is really moving. One of my favorite moments, is when Cruise and Rooker decide to race in there wheelchairs, and the ending was great and made me grin!, plus it's very well made and written as well!. This movie works extremely well due to Tom's great charisma, and the cast, and i thought the romance scenes were great!, plus it had some good humorous moments as well. This is grand entertainment at it's finest, with some incredible racing scenes, fantastic characters, and 2 amazing performances from Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, and i say Go see it immediately!. The Direction is Fantastic. Tony Scott does a wonderful job here, with wonderful camera work, great angles, injecting lots of style, and keeping the film at an extremely fast pace!. The Acting is wonderful!. Tom Cruise is amazing as always, and is amazing here, he has an extremely cocky and arrogant character, but he's extremely likable, due to his great charm and charisma, he had wonderful chemistry with Nicole Kidman, was fantastic in the acting department, had some cool lines, as always flashed that great smile of his, and was just a lot of fun to watch!.(Cruise Rules!!!!!!). Nicole Kidman is stunningly gorgeous, and is amazing as always, she is extremely likable, very caring had that great sexy accent, had wonderful chemistry with Cruise, and while she didn't really have all that much to do her presence was always very clearly felt! (Kidman Rules!!!!).Robert Duvall is wonderful as Cruise's Mentor, he seemed to be enjoying himself, had some great scenes with Cruise was intense, and was just perfect for this role!. Michael Rooker is fantastic as always and here is no different, he had that great look determination on his face as always, had an extremely cool character, and cracked me up a couple of times too i loved him! (Rooker Rules!). Randy Quaid played a role that was normal for once, and i bought it!, great job even though he didn't have much to do. Cary Elwes is OK here, as the main opponent, but we don't get to learn enough about his character really,as they just threw him in there halfway into the movie, he was OK i guess. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall Go see it immediately!. ***** out of 5"
"mwardf","9","9","13","12 October 2007"," Duvall excellent otherwise Top Gun with cars (and Nicole)
","In the Top Gun genre although without the homo eroticism. But a great performance from Duvall who lights up the screen every time he is on - which is often. Nicole Kidman lights up the screen as well and not just for her acting! Cruise is OK as the foil to Duvall's Harry. Tony Scott's direction is standard for a Bruckenheimer film and deserves applause.<br/><br/>The plot is entirely predictable and there is little tension. Like Top Gun the bits in between the action are too long and the sub plot of the injured driver coming to terms with his forced retirement is tedious and contributes little. BUT see this if only for Duvall's flawless performance."
"lukewarmcereal","7","6","8","27 March 2008"," Great NASCAR movie, a must see for NASCAR fans
","This movie seems a bit cheesy and clich√© at first glance and it somewhat is, but I still loved it. Tom Cruise basically re-acted Maverick from Top Gun (which is one of my all-time favorites. It's as if he changed his name from Pete Mitchell to Cole trickle, took off the flight suit and put on a NASCAR fire suit and there you have it. The story itself is cheesy, but that's why I liked it. A hotshot rookie NASCAR driver works his way up, gets in a big wreck, falls in love with a doctor, goes on to win the Daytona 500 after overcoming his trauma from the wreck. This wasn't some shakespearean intellectual masterpiece, which is why most people bash it. The Racing scenes are awesome and if you love car-action movies, you will watch these scenes over and over. The only thing is the excessive amount of bumping and rubbing. It added some degree of excitement, but was unrealistic for NASCAR. The only reason this gets a 9/10 is because the film and sound quality is not that good, compared to other movies at the time. The film seems a bit grainy to me, like it could have been shot in the 1970's. Overall, great movie, watch if your a fan of NASCAR, car action, or Tom Cruise. Im just waiting for a ""digitally remastered"" DVD."
"tfrizzell","Null","10","16","8 October 2003"," The Wheels on the Race-Car Go Round and Round, Round and Round, Round and Round.
","The world of car-racing has never been too exciting to me. It is a sport that just seems kind of dumb as cars run around in circles for hours on end. Fans of the sport are fanatics though and look at the contests as spiritual events. While ""Days of Thunder"" never did change my views of competitive auto-racing, I still found this movie to be surprisingly impressive. An adrenaline rush that makes something that is very dull to me be very intriguing. However with that said, ""Days of Thunder"" succeeds because of its characters and their relationships with one another and not its mind-blowing cinematography and editing during the race sequences. Tom Cruise literally comes out of nowhere one day and claims that there is nothing he cannot do with a race-car. Of course old-time crew chief Robert Duvall (making a perfect appearance as usual) soon realizes that the cocky Cruise is an out-of-this-world driver, but also discovers that the youngster really has a minimal knowledge of anything that has to do with cars other than driving. Soon they create a father-son bond that propels them to legitimacy in the race world. A terrible accident early on though leads Cruise to meet neurologist Nicole Kidman and romance blossoms very quickly. Cruise's hot temper though creates trouble with sponsors (Randy Quaid), NASCAR officials (Fred Dalton Thompson) and even fellow competitors (most notably Michael Rooker and Cary Elwes). As the film progresses it is made quite clear that Cruise, a man who seemed to not need anyone early on, needs Kidman and Duvall in his life. Tom Cruise come up with this story with legendary screenwriter Robert Towne (most notable for his work on ""Chinatown"" and he even wrote a portion of ""The Godfather"", going uncredited, as well). Towne handled the actual screen-writing duties by himself and does a completely under-rated job here. This movie has always been shunned by most critics and the general public. However, the old ""Formula One"" way of making a movie is more than adequate here. The chemistry on the silver screen between Cruise and Kidman cannot be denied and Duvall's ability to be so natural and wise in productions like this make him a very impressive asset. Definitely flawed, ""Days of Thunder"" still comes out winning the checkered flag. 4 stars out of 5."

In fact, this film might be more popular now since NASCAR is televised so much more these days. This movie may get a new audience. Frankly, I could care less about auto racing, back then and now, but I don't hate it, I love most other sports and I like a good movie. This was only fair in all categories. Not bad; not good.<br/><br/>Racing fans tell me there wasn't a lot of realism with this and actual NASCAR events - mainly involving sponsorship - back then, but I was looking an entertaining film....and I like Robert Duvall as actor and don't mind gazing at Nicole Kidman (who can also act.) Michael Rooker and Randy Quaid usually portray interesting people, too.<br/><br/>It's basically a story about a guy who wants to prove himself on the race track, and I have no problem with that.

","Tom Cruise cruises like thunder as Cole Trickle in Jerry Bruckheimer's, Days of Thunder. Cole Trickle, a name that became an icon, an inspiration and a hero for auto racing drivers way back in early 90's. An enthralling and roller coaster ride jammed with high octane racing action, enough to blast you off the seat. Days of Thunder gave birth to the sparkling chemistry between once upon a time two of the most memorable on-screen and off-screen couples Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a young and smashing, auto racing rookie, Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise), who, after trying in the American open wheel ranks, seeks to grab a win on the NASCAR circuit. Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall), his mentor is his crew's chief. He also develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), a brain surgeon who's not so easy to convince when it comes to love. Claire works on Cole after a severe race accident, while racing with his competitor, Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker). But then comes the arrogant and dangerous newcomer, Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes) with owner Tim Daland (Randy Quaid), challenges Cole for a comeback to the race track. Finally after being convinced by his friend Rowdy, Cole hits the race track to complete his unfinished business against Russ.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's classy portrayal of a hot shot auto racing rookie oozing with galvanizing confidence and energy won the millions of heart for his adorable and mesmerizing display of power and aggression as Cole Trickle. Starting with his stunning intro coming out from the smoke with a bike to defeating his rival Russ Wheeler at the end, he ignites an emulsifying inspiration in this journey of powerhouse racing. Cruise and Kidman's electrifying chemistry scorches the screen with witty dialogues and sizzling romance. Robert Duvall plays an absolute superb cameo complementing Cruise to the top.<br/><br/>Tony Scott's and Cruise's record breaking deadly combination that gifted the 1986's blockbuster, Top Gun reunited to recreate the same magic in Days of Thunder, which can be said as a sequel to Top Gun. Hans Zimmer's remarkable and awesome background score ecstatically blends with the mood when it comes to the racing events and defining the characters. Days of Thunder gives two of the best all time classic tracks: ""The Last Note of Freedom"" by David Coverdale and ""Show Me Heaven"" by Maria McKee.<br/><br/>If you are desperately into racing then Days of Thunder is the perfect one to punch the required inspirational boost within. It has its own indefinable class, style and persona that can't be left unnoticed. A must watch for Cruise fans; witness him cruising the top like never before."

Her co stars can get away with bad movies and performances because of who they are, but this was Nic's first Hollywood gig. Luckily big Tommy was able to look after her and ensure blockbuster success to Kidman in the future. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with the movie was the appalling script. Once again the big budget was able to overcome all these faults and turn it into a hit. If your wondering it's about car racing, I think, or something like that anyway.<br/><br/>A generous 3 out of 10."
"bob the moo","Null","19","41","23 August 2004"," Painting by numbers produces an average film despite the cast
","Eager for a winning formula, team owner Tim Daland puts together the inexperienced but naturally talented Cole Trickle and the retired but skilled mechanic Harry Hogge to hopefully bounce off each other to create a winning combination. After the expected bumps and friction between the two, they seem to blend well and start winning races. However, a major accident between Cole and his main rival, Rowdy Burns, puts them both in the hospital under the care of the professional and leggy Dr Lewicki. But will Cole be able to overcome the physical and mental scars that he got.<br/><br/>The comedian Rich Hall did a great routine once where he summed up the films of Tom Cruise by basically saying that each of them involves him being great at his job (pilot, bartender, driver) before suffering a crisis of confidence but meeting a beautiful lady who helps him over it in time to come good ¬ñ hilarious in the telling because he was right and, true to form, Days of Thunder sets its stall out in the same way. That the plot is formulaic (father/son stuff, macho posturing, love interest, final big race etc) and it is a bit tiring at times because it is nothing new and it produces large sags during the film. The father/son stuff is OK if hackneyed but the romance is so sudden and fake that it left me cool and never engaged once. The racing stuff is fun, noisy and fast which I suppose is what most of its audience want; but this is still not a great action movie but kudos to Scott for managing to make a load of cars going round a circular track appear exciting.<br/><br/>The cast is more impressive on paper than they are in reality. Cruise plays his usual character and does it with no real charm or ability. He is trading off his fame here and his macho nonsense is rather tiresome. Kidman may have been Cruise's offscreen partner but viewers of this film will have seen their divorce coming because they have zero chemistry and she is poor throughout. It's not all her fault though, the script gives her nothing to work with. Thank god then, for Robert Duvall; he may be playing a fairly clich√©d character but he does it well and steals every scene from his pretty but empty co-star. Support is good from Quaid and Rooker but Ewles is given too little time to make anything but a negative impression and Reilly had yet to prove his versatility and doesn't do it here.<br/><br/>Overall this is very much painting by the numbers in many regards. The plot is easy and lacks any sort of spark or innovation meaning that, when the cars are off the screen, it is easy for the film to get dull. The action scenes are OK but, as with F1, I find many motor sports to be dull and didn't get drawn into the predictable races as much as I wanted to. The script gives the cast nothing to really work with, and only Duvall comes out with any real dignity even if he has a clich√© as opposed to a real person to play. This has all the failings you would expect and the end result of so little imagination is an average film that is watchable but no more than that."

With a great supporting cast consisting of Robert Duvall, Nicole Kidman, Michael Rooker, Randy Quaid and John.C.Rielly, this movie is simply amazing. Now this movie is about a hot-shot race-car driver named Cole Trickle. He is teamed with Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) a crew chief who lost a driver at Daytona a year earlier. When these two are first paired together they at first despise each other with Cole's temper and Harry's resentfulness to work with him. When these two eventually bond Cole is unstoppable.<br/><br/>I first watched this when I was 4 and loved it. I would watch it over and over and again and pretend to be Cole Trickle. I would pretend that i was driving his car and would say the line "" I'm dropping the hammer!"" I love this movie. I have always loved this movie and i could still watch it over and over again.

I agree that some of the scenes are a little unbelievable, i.e. the amount of ""rubbin'"" that goes on would probably never happen during a Winston Cup race.Though,I don't think they stretch the movie too far out of proportion.

","They had no script, it was made up as they shot the film, a fact you can see from many characters looking at pieces of paper cleverly placed around scenes (notably those shot in the pit-lane) so they can remember the dialogue.<br/><br/>The film is bad, it's the repeated formula of the Cruise films which gets me and annoys me. If you've seen Top Gun, and lets face it, who hasn't, there's really no need to waste your time on this trash.<br/><br/>Bruckheimer has a lot to answer for. Everything seems to be made of cardboard, including the actors, the film is so bad it made Nicole Kidman fall in love with Tom Cruise.

"Spleen","7","5","9","27 August 1999"," Just this side of risible, but okay
","I don't know why I'm so kindly disposed towards this movie.  Maybe it's because Nicole Kidman was allowed to keep her Australian accent.  Maybe it's my reaction to injustice: this was much better than the god-awful `Top Gun', and yet the public clasped the latter to its bosom, and let the former die. Maybe the sheer volume of 1980s kitsch disarms me.  Maybe I'm just in a genial mood.<br/><br/>Well, anyway: here's how it's better than `Top Gun'.  There's a story. Maybe you can see not only the ending but every aspect of it from much more than a mile away - considering the speed at which these guys are racing, I'd say from about 90 miles away - but it's a bona fide, reasonably good story nonetheless.  It's more mature than `Top Gun', for what that's worth.  Tom Cruise is less of an irresponsible hoon when he's simply risking his own life and a few thousand dollars of sponsorship money, than when he's risking his own life, several million dollars of public money, and the fate of nations.  Moreover there's a decent explanation for WHY he's an irresponsible hoon that makes us (me, anyway) actually like him.<br/><br/>Now here's what's wrong.  The sport that all but one of the characters dedicate their lives to is `stock car racing', so called because each racer gets a stock car, pretty much identical to all the other cars.  There: now you know as much as I do, and I've SEEN the movie.  Nothing is as intrinsically dull as watching cars race each other - unless it's watching fighter jets move around - so the least they could have done was explain to us what's going on.  I notice that part-way through each race a car may stop to be serviced.  How does that work?  What kind of race is it where a driver can stop part way through and still win?  During the final race they casually let slip that Cruise has 45 seconds more he is allowed to spend at the pit stop before he's out of the race.  What's this time limit?  Where does it come from?  WOULD SOMEONE PLEASE EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT'S GOING ON?<br/><br/>Clear exposition isn't helped by the photography, which makes a race track look much less ugly than it otherwise would, and even generates nice images, but obscures the narrative.  Scott, Simpson and Bruckheimer give us their beloved graduated tobacco filter shots whenever the sky would otherwise appear - does anyone else get tired of that?  But much worse is the CONSTANT use of telephoto lenses.  In almost every shot it looks as if the camera is on the other side of the stadium and not ONCE do we get an image of good explanatory value.  Still, as I say, they're nice images.  It's a nice enough movie.  But I won't go any further than that."

And how a used-car salesman funds a Winston Cup team is completely beyond me.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is convincing in his driving incompetence.

From Tom Cruise's character to the punk that plays his nemesis after Roddy goes down..it's sickening. You want to jump on screen and punch the living daylights out of these guys, because this has no plausibility whatsoever. Cruise stinks...really he does. He can't act..you know it and I know it. He is so bad. You can so see right through him when he is on screen. Any race fan will tell you this movie is a mockery of what a real driver's life is like. Talladega Nights is more believable than this Cruise vehicle. And please...Nicole Kidman as a 25 year old Australian speaking brain surgeon working in Charlotte????? P U! Totally miscast. Only Roddy reminds me anything of what it takes to drive these things, when he says ""I'm gonna live forever"". That is the mentality needed to race automobiles that can kill you. I am disappointed with NASCAR in recent years, since it is so commercial and had lost contact with its roots. I am an open wheel fan deep down, but I respect the drivers that run inches from each other at 200MPH....Something any racing critic could never do without soiling their undergarments and killing themselves...but this movie cheapens and disgraces all those driver's heroism. This stinks. So does the ridiculous ending and how he goes from last to second in like 20 laps, at Daytona, no less, and then, well just guess what happens on the last turn of the last b.s. lap...

","This film has the worst cast of characters ever. I'm not necessarily speaking of actors, just the names of the people they portray. I mean, come on, Cole Trickle is bad enough (sounds like a gay hero's alter ego), but look at the rest of the names listed in this film: Harry Hogge, Claire Lewicki, Tim Daland, Russ Wheeler, Rowdy Burns, Big John, Buck Bretherton, Waddell, Aldo Bennedetti, Harlem Hoogerhyde...<br/><br/>It sounds like the screenwriter was too lazy to look up commonly used names so he just used his daughter's bedtime book: Harlem Hoogerhyde? Buck Bretherton? Harry Hogge? DID ANYONE LOOK AT THIS SCRIPT?! Didn't Robert Duvall stop and say, ""Hey, Harry Hogge sounds like the name of a pig from a lame children's book!"" <br/><br/>Apart from the rhyming names, we've got people like Rowdy Burns. Look, here's a hint. If you're making a movie about race car drivers, do NOT name the bad guy ""Rowdy."" And don't give him such an obvious last name. I mean, couldn't they have come up with something subtler than ""Wheeler""? <br/><br/>How about Harlem Hoogerhyde? I can't make up my mind. Either he's from Harlem, or he's about to snort a booger on Tom Cruise. What do you think? <br/><br/>Claire Lewicki rhymes with ""icky,"" and that's never a good thing. Then we finally come to Cole Trickle. This is probably the lamest name in the movie, which is sad considering it's the ""hero's."" It belongs in a gay porno flick.<br/><br/>And then there's the title of the film itself... ""DAYS OF THUNDER""!!! Wow, that's powerful! Unfortunately, it too belongs in a gay porno film. The sequel could be called ""The Adventures of Cole Trickle and Harry Hogge: DAYS OF POUNDING."" The only good thing about this film was the inclusion of Guns N' Roses' cover of Bob Dylan's ""Knockin' On Heaven's Door"" on the soundtrack."

"mrsjock1","8","5","10","23 July 2000"," NASCAR, and film? who would have thought that the two could make such a good movie?
","The answer to that question is obvious--producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, director Tony Scott, and superstar Tom Cruise, as they reunite after Top Gun for this Loud, Engine roaring racing romance.  This crew has taken what worked well for Top gun, and used in in a different, but not that much slower, mode of transportation. Thrills and spills abound, of course there is ONE great wreck in the movie, and from this wreck spins the romance of this film.  Nicole Kidman, and Tom Cruise once again hit it off in the Movies, but by this time they were together in real life too.  As such, the chemistry between the two was much greater in this film than in Top Gun. Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) must realize that driving stock-cars is different than driving indy cars, just as much as veteran stock-car racer Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall), must realize when building the car for Trickle.  As always, neither ever wants to admit that they could possibly be wrong, or not know something. But Hogge isn't the only one that Cole butts heads with.  Champion driver Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), Trickles major rival, is just as stubborn, and thick headed as the rest of them. After the wreck that takes both Trickle, and Rowdy out of a major race, the two are hospitalized together, and become friends--of a sort.<br/><br/>Trickle and Burns must both face their own mortality, but in different ways.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>(as a side note, and my opinion only, this is one of the best examples of what a difference a DVD player and home theatre speakers can make compared to a plain old VCR)."
"The-Sarkologist","4","3","5","21 December 2011"," A very predictable movie about stock car racing
","Stock car racing is not really that much of an interest to me and as such I was not really all that interested in this film. I decided to watch it though because it is one of those movies that a lot of people have seen. As such we become one of the masses by watching this movie.<br/><br/>My opinion was that it is all right. I am in two minds about Tom Cruise's entrance to the movie. We spend about five minutes hearing about a great new driver and Cruise enters all arrogant, macho like acting as if he knows everything. On the track he seems good but when he is put in the actual race he seems to be quite panicky about the style of racer. If he was that good then I doubt he would be freaking out on the track. But I guess that is a part of the character of Cole Trickler (stupid name I think). He is a natural driver, but driving on an empty track and driving on a track full of other drivers are two different things.<br/><br/>Days of Thunder is about macho contests (I have chosen not to be crude here). Basically it is about a group of men trying to prove who is the manliest of the lot of them. In this contest people get hurt, and even killed, but that doesn't stop them. In fact, as quoted in the movie, they refuse to go to a hospital or even a funeral so that the inevitable is as far from their mind as possible.<br/><br/>Plot wise I predicted it quite accurately. He becomes a racer and is good but has a nasty crash. He goes to hospital, meets the love interest (Nicole Kidman) and then goes back to racing where he wins the big race. The plot is not all that thin though because there is a relationship element in the film as well: not the shallow relationship between him and Kidman, but rather between him and another driver. At first they are rivals but after the crash, they are brought together, and though they have a smash up with a couple of rent-a-cars, they soon become friends after the steam has been vented.<br/><br/>What used to be a movie on the lips of everybody has now simply faded away to an 11:00 time slot. They claimed that there were a lot of hot scenes between Cruise and Kidman in this movie, but there is not: only for about five minutes in the middle of the movie. What I did like was the style of photography in the film. It has a very dusky feel to it that I thought added depth to the movie. To me, it is an average movie that it okay once but that is as far as I would go."

Oh & of course (8) The victory at the end & everything else falls into place.<br/><br/>I seem to be different to others but being a sports lover I prefer my sport to be ... er ... sport and not through a film. Any sport, motor racing included gives you all the tension & emotion you need from it and 10 times more than any film can ever do, so I don't know why directors bother with films such as this.<br/><br/>But despite the plot that you can peg, even before the credits open at the start & Cruises cringing line near the end ""He's goin down"" or something, it's still watchable.

While they are correct from one standpoint (there is no way a car going 190 mph can just decide to ""put a driver in the wall""), I think many overlook the fact that this is the only big time movie centered around NASCAR racing that has been released in years.  I enjoy the film for its music, real race footage, and action. When you watch it, be you a die-hard racing fan or a casual fan, you should enjoy the racing scenes it portrays. I rated this movie at an 8 just for the fact that it will put you in a racing mood. A side note: Great shots throughout the film of the Chevrolet Luminas: the car of choice after Monte Carlo production ended in the late eighties. Hendrick motorsports served as a ""consultant"" for the film, and Rick Hendrick has always run Chevrolet race cars - thus the abundance of Luminas in the film. Where are the Grand Prixs, Thunderbirds, Cutlasses and Regals?  Nonetheless, great movie to see if you are a race nut like myself."

Indeed, it's interesting to watch this with all that's gone down: Cruise divorced Mimi Rogers (for which she must be eternally grateful) shortly after filming and took up with America's Newest Sweetheart, then dumped her when the 50/50 clause of their pre-nup was about to kick in. But don't feel too sorry for Nicole: she reportedly got Tommy Boy to cough up $65 mill, then walked off with the Oscar.

","DAYS OF THUNDER is a typically slick car racing thriller from Tony Scott, the kind of film which looks flashy and expensive but has little actual depth or insight into the sport or those who participate as it. It's one of those films starring a youthful Tom Cruise whom the camera loves so much that he positively radiates throughout. He's also a little too good to be true. The film mainly charts the rivalry between Cruise and a rival driver (the great Michael Rooker), but that kind of situation was done more realistically in the likes of RUSH. The car scenes are appropriately shot and Scott knows how to make the chrome look good. Cast-wise, Robert Duvall does well as the spiky manager, but Nicola Kidman is way out of her depth as the unnecessary love interest."
"Tweekums","7","2","3","27 August 2018"," Cruise trades his wings for wheels and NASCAR action
","This film sees Tom Cruise playing Cole Trickle, a successful Californian race car driver who wishes to switch to stock-cars. He is an instinctive and very fast driver but he has difficulty switching to the very different cars; constantly pushing them beyond their limits; destroying engines and tyres in the process. He quickly develops a rivalry with current champion Rowdy Burns but gradually improves and starts winning races... then he and Rowdy have a terrible collision that puts them both in hospital. While Cole gradually recovers, and develops a relationship with his attractive doctor, another young driver takes over his car. When he finally back to racing he has a new rival and must also deal with his own nerves.<br/><br/>This film is very much 'Top Gun in stock cars' with an almost identical plot... that doesn't matter too much though as it is a successful formula and the impressive editing and camerawork keep the race action exciting. Tom Cruise is solid as the arrogant Trickle and Robert Duvall adds a touch of class as engineer Harry Hogge who optimises his car. Nicole Kidman is likeable as love interest Dr. Claire Lewicki. There are few real surprises but if you want good solid action with no real villains, just rivals, you could do a lot worse. Overall I wouldn't say this is a must see it is an exciting and undemanding way to pass the time."

"view_and_review","8","1","1","22 February 2020"," I Don't Even Like NASCAR!
","""Days of Thunder"" must be good because I don't even like stock car racing and this movie made it interesting and exciting. I can't lie, the primal roar of those beefy engines just speaks to me. It's like a lost language that I instinctively respond to without knowing why.<br/><br/>Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) was a hotshot driver from California who wowed people enough to get himself onto the NASCAR circuit as a rookie driver. His crew chief and carmaker, Harry (Robert Duvall), was the wise and wily NASCAR veteran. Tim Daland (Randy Quaid) was the owner. Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman) was the love interest.<br/><br/>Still not enough names?<br/><br/>Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker) was the friend. Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes) was the competition. Big John (Fred Dalton) was the commissioner of NASCAR. Buck Brotherton (John C. Riley in his first NASCAR movie) was a crew member.
That should be enough names for you.<br/><br/>I was into the movie from the first scene, and the second scene cemented my interest. I wanted to see what this California kid could do on the track. The whole movie was cruising along pretty well though it hit a small pothole at one point. The movie certainly could've done without the self-righteous and very flawed diatribe from Dr. Girlfriend. ""Control is an illusion,"" she yelled as the concerned and fearful girlfriend who didn't want her beau to get back behind the wheel. Where did she get that fortune cookie nonsense from?<br/><br/>It's a sports movie. There is no decent sports movie except there is an obstacle for the athlete to overcome. Sometimes the obstacle is external, sometimes it's internal. The bigger the obstacle the bigger the triumph. With every good sports movie there is also a human-interest story within it and sometimes even a love story. I can always use more human interest and less love story, but what are you gonna do?"

","Days of Thunder follows pretty much the same vein as Top Gun, up until Mission Impossible his biggest success.<br/><br/>It is made by the same filmmakers as Top Gun, late director Tony Scott and the Simpson/Bruckheimer production team.<br/><br/>Cruise plays a NASCAR driver Cole Trickle. A young, rash at times, dangerous character like the one he plays in Top Gun, Maverick.<br/><br/>The similarities don't end there. You have a love interest (a very Australian Doctor played by a young Nicole Kidman) and an older mentor in the shape of Robert Duvall as mechanic Harry.<br/><br/>The scenes of the NASCAR races at circuits such as Daytona are pure testosterone like the dog fights in Top Gun!<br/><br/>Casting is good.

","Tom Cruise in an action movie about NASCAR drivers - I was convinced I would quit after about fifteen minutes. I was wrong. Although I am not a fan of films like this, nor of the aforementioned gentleman, the film has held my undivided attention from start to finish. Although this movie is primarily an adrenaline fun, the story makes sense, has some depth and message. Nothing new or original, but universal enough that it does not become obsolete. Besides, the film features Nicole Kidman in her early twenties, which in itself is reason enough to watch it. And there are also Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, and John C. Reilly. The sound is great, and the roar of racing cars is accompanied by a legendary soundtrack (Gimme Some Lovin' - Spencer Davis, Break Through the Barrier - Tina Turner, Trail of Broken Hearts - Cher, Hearts in Trouble - Chicago, You Gotta Love Someone - Elton John, Show Me Heaven - Maria McKee, The Last Note of Freedom - David Coverdale,...). The only thing I would object is that the plot is extremely predictable from start to finish, so there is no tension, but the good pace and scenes of car racing make up for this shortcoming, so the movie is not boring for a moment.<br/><br/>7/10"
"slightlymad22","6","1","1","27 September 2017"," The Tom Cruise Template Is Starting To Bore
","Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Days Of Thunder (1990)<br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Cole Trickle (Cruise) a young hot shot stock car driver, gets his chance to compete at the top level <br/><br/>Cruise does not make it 3 in a row, following on from Rain Man and Born On The Fourth Of July, this movie is a let down. One of its main problems is The problem that plagues all racing movies, predictability!! You know how it is going to end. Then add the fact that it was just exactly like so many other Cruise movies (Top Gun, Colour Of Money and Cocktail) I have watched recently. The Cruise character, a young, cocky but naturally talented kid, who could be the best, if only he could learn some damn self control and discipline. He has a mentor, an older man, who has been there and done it all, and knows talent when he sees it, then throw in a love interest, older and more mature than Cruise. It's practically a template, only the occupation changes (Pilot, Pool Player, Bartender) nothing else.<br/><br/>As I said above Cruise is just playing the standard Tom Cruise character as in the other movies. He doesn't offer anything new at all, and following on from his last two performances, that is a shame. Nicole Kidman doesn't really offer anything to the movie, and gives no indication of the star she would be come. Randy Quaid is normally an actor I cringe watching, but he is OK here. Michael Rooker, an actor I always like seeing and John C Reilly another actor I enjoy watching high offer reliable support. Don Simpson cast himself in a supporting role in this movie, however he was so bad, that his role was reduced to a single line. <br/><br/>The best thing in this movie is Robert Duvall. The man never disappoints, and this movie is no exception. He is head and shoulders above everyone else. <br/><br/>The movie was a troubled production from the off, Don Simpson, Jerry Bruckheimer and Robert Towne argued with director Tony Scott daily. Production began without a finished script. Scenes were often written the day of filming. During one driving sequence, Tom Cruise (who has a Story By credit) had to read his lines off cue cards attached to his windshield. For subsequent driving sequences, Cruise was fitted with a special earpiece to have lines fed to him. The budget doubled, and would have needed to make $100 million to just break even, which back then was a huge amount. <br/><br/>Days Of Thunder grossed $82 million at the domestic box office, to end the year the 13th highest grossing movie of 1989. <br/><br/>Random side note. The film's disappointing box office performance destroyed the relationship between Paramount and producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer. After the film under-performed the studio asked Simpson and Bruckheimer to give Paramount nine million dollars of their earnings for this movie back to defray losses. The producers responded by telling Paramount they were done working for them."
"adamscastlevania2","6","1","1","12 April 2015"," No substance at all, yet still a decent time passer
","(54%) Tom Cruise and and Tony Scott return, only this time Tom drives a really fast car instead of driving a really fast plane. This very much tries to follow on the back of the success of Top gun with more or less the same plot and structure with its bolted on love story sub-plot and more than a fair share of fast paced action. So in terms of being a modern-day classic this doesn't have what it takes, it's too crude, predictable, and forgettable; yet it's still worth a look for either fans of the director/star or racing cars. Cruise's character is an underdeveloped show-off, but he is at least played with a degree of effort. And this is a well made production with well directed action, a good supporting cast, and a quality feel throughout."
"jamesluk","6","1","1","24 January 2006"," Wow, what a retread!
","I finally saw this movie last night after being aware of it for 16 years. I had been reading up on producer Don Simpson, and realized that not only is this movie another Simpson-Bruckheimer production with Tom Cruise starring and Tony Scott directing, but it actually has a screenplay by Robert Towne! Wow, they must have really wanted to throw Towne a bone, because I soon realized this picture is literally Top Gun on wheels. Every major plot point is the same, from the Cruise character's buddy being taken out of the action by an accident(Michael Rooker now instead of Anthony Edwards), to Cruise falling for a smart, professional, tough, much taller beauty(Nicole Kidman this time instead of Kelly McGillis), to Cruise having to overcome a confidence problem and get back in the saddle(helped along by Robert Duvall here instead of Tom Skerrit), to even trotting out another tall, blond, crew-cut nemesis for him to defeat(Cary Elwes this time instead of Val Kilmer). I guess it made sense for Simpson-Bruckheimer to not toy with a successful formula, but come on guys, talk about deja vu! With the current mania for NASCAR, it seems like this movie was just a little premature."

","Days of Thunder has by far got to be one of the best race movie ever. Lots of good race action and a great cast that work so well together. I never miss a chance to watch it when aired. Tom did a great job as Cole Trickle and Robert as his crew chief. The story line was good and as a Nascar fan I can relate to it with no problem. I also liked the way they made of real race footage in the movie it really added to the story line. The comedy was also very good just the right amount to keep you wanting for more.

"ThomasEdison","2","3","6","30 November 2003"," Fails on all levels
","Let's look at how many ways this is a poor movie ...<br/><br/>On The Facts: Other reviewers have commented on how far this movie strays from real NASCAR racing. See them for the details. This movie is an insult to the high science that is NASCAR today. Other reviewers say that the facts don't make a difference. Any moviemakers worth their salt can make a movie that is absolutely true to facts and still is good drama. See ""Apollo 13.""<br/><br/>On The Technique: This could have been a film school essay on using crass cliche'. Cinematography was ok at best. Makeup is a mess... the drivers look like they just came from filming ""Backdraft."" Product placement is so obvious and obnoxious that it distracts you from the movie constantly. Perhaps that is doing you a favor.<br/><br/>On The Acting: Most of the characters seem like they have brain damage. They should have seen the neurologists at birth. Sorry Mr. Duvall, but dropping syllables off words and words off sentences is not what a south accent sounds. And the romance between Cruise and Kidman? They are both hot and they like to have sex. There is the basis of the relationship ... actually the whole relationship.<br/><br/>On The Concept: This is just a feature-length commercial, and it does not sell its dozens of products well at all. I'm not a racing fan, but anyone knows that NASCAR racing, the #1 spectator sport in the nation, is a great concept for movie-making. Unfortunately the good movie about modern NASCAR has not yet been made. NASCAR and producers, if you want a blueprint for your next movie, look at Days of Thunder and do everything differently."

Cruise at his very best in those kinda roles. The car noise and thumping music add such a wonderful atmosphere to this genre. And to see Duval( sheer talent) talk about the dog and what a dog can do and can't do. Still rocks.To see kidman in her early years opposite cruise as the love interest is still a hoot. Also Michael Rooker is seriously good as Rowdy. Then Randy Quaid turning in as he does a greedy race team owner who will do all he can to up his game.

"mjj237","4","2","4","17 November 2006"," Bad even for a racing movie
","Let's get this straight: I have been, almost from birth, a great fan of auto racing of all kinds (although, admittedly, I've grown to like NASCAR in particular less and less in recent years as it's become just a little bit too big for its own good). I have also been disappointed by every racing movie I've ever seen. Sure, Grand Prix and Le Mans both have some awesome action shots and some really cool cars, but the stories are dead in the water.<br/><br/>And yet Days of Thunder makes both of those earlier films look like great art. This is just Top Gun on the ground, full of a lot of noise and action paired with a fantastically awful, Scotch-taped-into-place love story.<br/><br/>Some of the action sequences are worth seeing, and there are some nice touches of comic relief (the ice cream incident in the pits, for instance), but they're sorely needed because the rest of the movie is so mind-numbingly heavyhanded. All right, I get it. The brash youngster has a lot to learn before he can run with the big boys and win the heart of the...23-year-old brain surgeon? What? Yeah. Nicole Kidman in this role might be the worst casting decision in the history of the cinema.<br/><br/>A muddled mess and a fine example of what's wrong with the action genre: there's plenty of eye candy and super-cool stunts, but you don't have a movie without a story. So they sorta just fished around in the trash until they pulled out a story, and it shows."

","A pretty good racing movie. As a sports film, you pretty much know the story arc, and the ending, but hey, that's what genre movies do.

Thirty years on, stock car racing bears little resemblance to what is portrayed here, save for action on the track.<br/><br/>Cruise was Cruise. It was nice seeing Nicole Kidman back before she ruined her face. Robert Duvall absolutely stole the show. NASCAR is very colorful, and makes for excellent big-screen visuals. I liked the movie."
"Hey_Sweden","7","0","0","27 June 2020"," Duvall raises this rating by a point.
","The star, producers, and director of ""Top Gun"" reteam for another story in which Tom Cruise is the cocky young hotshot determined to prove himself to the world. This time, he's a race car driver named Cole Trickle (what were they thinking with THAT name?), taken under the wing of a veteran crew chief and car builder, Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall). Cole definitely has a lot to learn, and he even admits to Harry that he knows precious little about cars, despite having a talent at driving them.<br/><br/>If you love cars and you love racing, you'll have a head start on other viewers when it comes to this ultra-slick, loud, but VERY predictable action-drama. It's completely lacking in any sort of suspense. Even when Cole is critically injured in a major crash, the viewer has no doubt that he'll be back in racing form in record time.<br/><br/>As can be expected, all the race track action is first rate: well shot and well edited. It's an exceptionally good looking picture, with colours that just pop off the screen. There's a romantic subplot where Cole develops a lust for the sexy young neurosurgeon (Nicole Kidman) who helped to save his life; Cruise and Kidman work well together and it's not a surprise that they would become a real-life couple.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's a first rate cast that really makes this worth seeing. Able support is provided by Randy Quaid, Cary Elwes, John C. Reilly, and Michael Rooker, the latter playing Coles' race track nemesis who eventually becomes his friend. Other familiar faces (Fred Thompson, J.C. Quinn, Caroline Williams, Margo Martindale) turn up, with producer Don Simpson appearing on screen as Aldo Bennedetti. But it's Duvall who is the true MVP of this production. He's just a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>""Days of Thunder"" is largely visceral entertainment that basically works on a mindless level, with Cruise flashing his smile at any and every opportunity.<br/><br/>Screenplay by Robert Towne, based on a story by him and Cruise.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."

","Days of Thunder is one of those films I keep going back to. I remember seeing it in the cinema and thinking it was quite entertaining but it gets better with age. It's basically Top Gun on a race track, typical of what Tony Scott did at the time (like the underrated Revenge). Wonderfully flashy, with beautifully shot scenes composed in camera with filters, which gives a more gritty, cinematic feel than many of today's over processed, computer enhanced efforts. An early Hans Zimmer score completes the audio-visual bombardment. Occasionally drifts into a Gillette advert. If you haven't seen it for a while - or ever - give it a go.

My main beefs with Days is the ridiculously bad performances turned in by Kidman and Elwes. They were both horrific. For the life of me, I can't figure out how Kidman has managed to have a film career at all. Being the former Mrs. Cruise can't hurt. She makes Kelly McGilis in Top Gun look sincere. As far as Elwes goes, I just hate everything he overacts. Duvall and Quaid turn in serviceable performances here, anchoring the movie well.<br/><br/>The racing scenes are fairly exciting to watch, and personally, I think the rental car scene makes the whole movie worth watching.

","Starring Tom Cruise, directed by Tony Scott and brought to us by Bruckheimer and Simpson, that's a roll call of reasons why many would hate this before even watching it!<br/><br/>Days of Thunder is pretty indicative of the films being made by this lot around this time. Sure there's a honest intention somewhere within to build potent character dynamics, to raise moral awareness and etc, but they always came down to relying on speedy thrills, simmering sexual tensions and a punch the air finale. These latter things are evident in Days of Thunder, making it very much enjoyable if judging on those terms.<br/><br/>The actual dynamic of the stock car racing set-up as portrayed here is a bit suspect, but the thrills come in leaps and bounds as the cars career around the tracks and slam into each other while the respective drivers' egos explode in a flaming ball of testosterone. There's Cruise with his arrogant grin, there's Michael Rooker scowling and there's Carey Elwes doing his worst Val Kilmer Iceman impression. While out in the pits Robert Duvall adds the bit of class by juggling a dual role of surrogate father and expert stock-car manager, and Kidman as ace doctor Claire Lewicki shuffles around wondering just what is the point of all this emotionally damaged machismo.<br/><br/>The makers don't cut any corners in their willingness to raise your pulse, and they succeed in that comfort food sort of way.

Tom Cruise plays the role of Cole Trickle, a feisty upstart who gets his breaks in being a stock car driver. Cocky and hotheaded his first win gets him pumped for more. With Robert Duvall as Harry Hogge Randy Quaid as Tim Daland, and Nicole Kidman as Dr. Lewicki, you got a winner! Being a winner isn't all what its cracked up to be. You got to be looking out for one another. And I liked the part where they played a prank on Trickle with that NC State Trooper who turned out to be a hot babe. I thought state troopers were rugged looking, then again who knows. The accident scene was plenty scary, and the troop incident went to Trickle's head a little too much.

","If your a fan of Formula One, or you have a thing for Tom Cruise, then you might like this not too bad sports drama, from Sir Ridley's brother director Tony Scott, (Top Gun, True Romance, Enemy of the State). Basically Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) knows everything about high speed auto car racing on the NASCAR circuit, and along comes hotshot rookie racer Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) to be mentored by him. His talent for racing is eventually found, and even after an accident with nemesis racer Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), he is determined to get back behind the wheel, and also, he finds a relationship with his doctor, Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), oh, Cruise and Kidman married four months later. Oh, and Cole had a replacement with Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes), but when Rowdy is unable to drive, he gives him his car, and Cole is Russ's nemesis in the big race. Also starring Randy Quaid as Tim Daland, Fred Dalton Thompson as Big John, Chicago's John C. Reilly as Buck Bretherton, J.C. Quinn as Waddell, Don Simpson as Aldo Bennedetti, Caroline Williams as Jennie Burns, Donna Wilson as Darlene and Chris Ellis as Harlan Hoogerhyde. I think the best reason to see this is for the racing, some of the acting, from Cruise, Duvall and Kidman (putting on her natural Australian accent), I'm not all surprised it was a box office flop, but don't let that fact spoil you trying it. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound. Tom Cruise was number 32, and Kidman number 21 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Cruise was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons.

Then maybe watch it once and see if you can manage it, but it was a worse version of ""Top Gun"".<br/><br/>There was almost no connection between the characters, and I didn't really care about any of them throughout the film.
The rivalry between the characters wasn't that good either and could've been a lot more developed.
The characters were boring and one-dimensional, and having the doctor as a love interest was unnecessary because it contributed to nothing except boring conversations. It was like they just needed some love interest to get more people to watch the movie and just put it in with no other reason.<br/><br/>The races were nice at parts, but they filmed the drivers' faces a lot which was unnecessary and just took away the action they could've had.
It tried to be thrilling and make you happy when the main character won but it didn't. It wasn't like in other movies where you become relieved or shout a small 'yes', it was just predictable on who would win or what would happen.<br/><br/>It was a predictable movie with clich√©s with no connection between the one-dimensional characters and the only thing that made me continue watching it was the racing and the hope that the movie would end soon."

","NASCAR is probably the most idiotic sport in America that keeps attracting audiences.  The only element that makes it unique, of course, is the promise of crashing.  Hours of boredom for the promise of action, much like common view of Bruckheimer's projects.  It's also the only thing that keeps fans coming back.  Since this project starts with an insipid frame (NASCAR racing), it must either have visual flair--which dies quickly--or subtexts in the metagame.<br/><br/>I will skip commenting on plot and visual flair because this is, after all, a Bruckheimer production.  Jerry has his own ""slave crews"" ranging from sound teams to photographers and editors.  He even has directors and composers in his pocket--here it's Tony Scott and Cruise with Zimmer in support.<br/><br/>No, I saw this to compare what Tony does with Cruise compared with what Tony's brother, Ridley, did in 'Legend'.  In 'Legend', Cruise is a cog in the grand machine of things (like the character structuring in 'ALIEN'). Here, Cruise is the machine running things--how ironic.<br/><br/>So Tony, Tom and Jerry try and still fail again.  Tony would try sports again with 'Boyscout' while Bruckheimer returned to Cops and Military genre with someone else--Michael Bay.  Ironically, Ridley's foray with Jerry differed because Scott passed off his vision for 'Blackhawk' as ""macho-gung-ho 'Top Gun' stuff"" and Jerry fell for it.<br/><br/>Jerry has made only three interesting efforts (the first 'Cop', 'Blackhawk', and 'Pirates') so far.

","I think the only thing they got right in this movie is the the cars go fast. Other than that, they were completely off-track (pun intended).<br/><br/>1) Russ Wheeler says in a pre-race interview: ""If Cole comes near me, I'm gonna put him in the wall."" In reality, you're out of the race, with a nice hefty fine. Maybe permanently parked.<br/><br/>2) Cars on the lead lap were lining up on the inside. In reality, lead-lap cars line up on the outside, and cars that are a lap or more down line up on the inside (unless there are ten or less laps left, then it's single file).<br/><br/>3) The amount of on-track banging that the movie has. After a car has been beaten up as badly as some of those were, there is no way they could keep up that pace, especially at Daytona. (Unless it's a DEI car at the plate tracks, then NASCAR allows them to cheat so the sheep who blindly follow Jr. can have their three or four wins per season.)<br/><br/>4) The passing at Daytona is completely unrealistic, as there is no way that a single car can pass a line of cars. Can't be done. No way. Not with the aero-packages and the restrictor plates. (Unless, of course, it's a DEI car. See reason three above.)<br/><br/>5) There was a caution with two laps to go, and miraculously they were able to get the race going with one lap left. Not possible. They have to open the pits for at least one lap. If there were three laps left, it might be possible if they stopped the race immediately.<br/><br/>6) Cars are not built in a barn. Maybe in NASCAR's infancy, but by the 70's, things had changed tremendously, and if a NASCAR car was built that way, it would maybe finish the race. But could not contend for the win. It would be a thirtieth place car at best.<br/><br/>The story was pretty bad, too. If you watched ""Top Gun"" (another stinker, if you actually sit down and TRY to watch it), you've seen ""Days of Thunder"". Just with a different vehicle under Tom Cruise's butt. Even the racing scenes were boring.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie like the plague. Because if you don't, you'll fee like you have the plague after you're done watching it.

It was a nice, light movie, definitely entertaining.<br/><br/>I was particularly taken with the chemistry between Tom & Nicole.  This is the best love scene I've seen with Tom Cruise so far.  It really made me wistful about their breakup.  She looks fabulous with a bit more fat on her legs than she has now.  She's gotten almost emaciated recently.  Tom was really at his peak in this movie: just stunning.<br/><br/>The only bad thing about the movie is that the race scenes are too long and very boring.  On the one hand they are sort of necessary to the plot, but, on the other hand, they are intolerable, especially the incessant roaring. The great thing about video tape is that you can fast forward through parts of them.  If you like to see people wrecking cars, you might like to watch these parts, though.  I wonder, do people really intentionally bang into each other in these races like this?  Is that allowed?  It seems a bit like the old Roman gladiators who killed each other for the entertainment of the crowd.  You have to wonder why this stuff is legal, if it really happens this way."
"Rooblakas","Null","0","1","17 May 2003"," Good decent action/adventure film, despite errors and exaggeration.
","In my opinion, Days Of Thunder is a pretty decent film; I have seen it many times. The only things that really made me like this film were the Days Of Thunder cars themselves and their outside exterior appearances (#46 City Chevrolet Lumina, #51 Exxon Chevrolet Lumina, #46 Superflo Chevrolet Lumina, #18 Hardee's Chevrolet Lumina, & #51 Mello Yello Chevrolet Lumina). All of these race cars (stock cars) were mainly the stars of the film. The plot was so and so, having either Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), or Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes) bumping and rubbing the car of Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) on the track for the win, and vice versa. In reality, NASCAR Winston Cup Officials would not tolerate that mess as they would penalize all of them for rough driving, thus suffering stiffer penalties in the sport itself. As for Nicole Kidman, Robert Duvall, Randy Quaid, and the rest of the cast, they did okay in playing their characters in this film. Days Of Thunder is an exaggerated, fantasy version of NASCAR Winston Cup Racing. Not only that, the editing of Cole Trickle's car passing all those smoke-looking cars and going after either Rowdy Burns, or Russ Wheeler is horrible as well as the editing of real NASCAR races for the movie itself. In one scene, the cars are racing at Darlington. When they go to another scene, the cars are racing at Daytona. Days Of Thunder is pretty enjoyable good action/adventure film; it is basically all about the driven, hard-edged racing ego to win. My rating: 3 stars out of 5."
"Old Joe","Null","0","1","10 April 2003"," ¬ëCruise like Thunder', in the ultimate movie for rev-head fanatics!
","I want to come out and say, that I am not the biggest fan of Hollywood star, Tom Cruise. I find him to be an arrogant kind of character onscreen, with some of his movies just ¬ëbad'. Yet I can understand why people like him, he is a star and does do some great films. Well I still say to people that my favourite Tom Cruise movie is the NASCAR racing hit, ¬ëDays Of Thunder'. But public opinion is divided as to whether it is a great film or not. Here is what I think¬Ö¬Ö.<br/><br/>Engines roar and fever pitch of professional racing is alive and well. Meet race car driver Cole Trickle, whose talent and ambition are surpassed only by his burning need to win. Discovered by businessman Tim Daland, Cole is teamed with legendary crew chief and car-builder Harry Hogge to race for the Winston Cup at the Daytona 500. However a fiery crash nearly ends Cole's career and he must turn to beautiful doctor, Claire Lewicki to regain his nerve and the true courage needed to race, to win and to live. <br/><br/>
When it comes to ¬ëDays Of Thunder', I look at it as a film which can be viewed by either the head or the heart. My ¬ëhead' feels that ¬ëDOT' is a clich√©d and standard Hollywood movie that follows a standard and overused plot. The main star is always playing a hot-headed character that finds it hard to take direction. This movies success has to partly come from what a successful movie ¬ëTop Gun' was. I have to also ask: are movies that follow the same format good for cinema? My answer is yes and no. Yes, because they bring movie-goers and the bucks in, and can be thought of as a classic. Then the answer could be no, as these films are nothing new and do not make cinema experiences fresh and exciting. <br/><br/>Yet what my heart says about ¬ëDOT' gives quite a different spin on it all together. It is an exciting movie that not only shows the competitive side of racing, but what lengths a race driver will go to be behind the wheel. I also like the relationship that Cole (Cruise) has with his crew chief Harry (Robert Duvall). Then with all Jerry Bruckheimer films, if you have an enjoyable experience, then that will last with you for alongtime to come.<br/><br/>
So with all that in prospective, ¬ëDOT' is a great film in my opinion. The racing sequences are well incorporated into a story about a racer that is pushed, and once he is, you will not like the reaction that you get. Tom Cruise's performance is pretty good. I like how we see him go from being one sort driver to the other. However my favourite character has to be Harry, as Robert Duvall is great in what he says and does. He gets Cole through many races with clever and intelligent moves, that many experienced crew chiefs would not even think of. <br/><br/>Other roles that need to be highlighted include Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker), who is the driver that brings the best out in Cole, with the pair's competitive streak and friendship just great for the film in my view. The role of Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman) has been praised and criticised by fans. I personally like what she brings to the film, as her character brings great sexual tension to the story and makes Cole realise that everything is not quite right for him in life. Of course it is common knowledge that ¬ëDOT' was the film that sparked the 11 year relationship for Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, which unfortunately fell apart in 2001.<br/><br/>¬ëDOT' was directed by Ridley Scott's brother, Tony. Tony really brought out the important racing themes well for us all to see. I understand that some people might not have liked the direction Scott took us on, but all the themes are brought out in such a way that I simply enjoyed. Also, the way Scott focused on the many characters in the movie, which was well done from where I see it, as this definition helps to make the movie all the greater.<br/><br/>
This has been a challenging review to write as I have tried to be as impartial on the film as I can be. Cole Trickle was right ¬ëhe can do anything in a race car' and this attitude is what I like about Cole. Like other Tom Cruise movies such as ¬ëTop Gun', ¬ëThe Colour of Money' and ¬ëCocktail', ¬ëDays Of Thunder' does follow a stock standard plot. Yet I am a racing car fan of sorts, and thus, this movie has and will remain memorable for me for many years to come. It also points out to me, that a movie really can be viewed differently by the head and the heart. <br/><br/>CMRS gives ¬ëDays Of Thunder': 4 (Very Good Film)"
"DukeEman","6","0","1","12 February 2003"," TOP GUN takes to the racing track.
","This time around with a decent enough script from the maestro, Robert ""CHINATOWN"" Towne! After working on THE COLOR OF MONEY with PAUL ""Racing car freak"" Newman, Cruise got the bug and this film was born. Yep! It's another ""Boys Own Story"" that is saved by Duvall's lovable performance and the ego love hate relationship between Tom's character Cole and Elwes' Russ. Oh, yes... Lets not forget the romance side of it with dear Nicole. Nothing important, just something to attract the female audience. Not!"

","Tom Cruise did an incredible job. The movie was based on the NASCAR series which was a great idea. Lots of people out there don't understand racing, but after watching this particular movie, you will begin to appreciate everything that it has to offer. Nicole Kidman did an amazing job as well. The concepts were done creatively and made it show the life that racers have to go through. It's a matter of life and death sometimes. Recommend this to people that love NASCAR."
"Wiseguy32","Null","0","1","20 June 2002"," Days of Thunder (1990) - *** (out of ****)
","PLOT: Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) is a guy with a lot of talent behind the wheel of a race car, but his weakness is his burning desire to win.  He is discovered by Tim Daland (Randy Quaid), and Cole is then teamed up with Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall), a car builder who wants to help Cole make it to the big time.  Nicole Kidman plays the love interest as a beautiful doctor who helps Cole recover after a really bad accident on the tracks, and she also helps him in a few other areas.<br/><br/>MY TAKE:  Days of Thunder is a fun popcorn movie that manages to stay interesting throughout.  Tom Cruise, Robert Duvall, and Nicole Kidman are the major players, and they're all good in their roles.  The movie has some very good racing action, although I couldn't help but feel those scenes were a little short.  The movie is also a tad predictable, but, overall, it crosses the finish line with grace on what it's supposed to do:  provide some solid popcorn entertainment.  To say the least, think of this movie as 2001's Driven with actual substance."
"RNMorton","6","0","1","17 October 1999"," Solid cast can't overcome silly plot
","Before this film came out, there had never been a really good stock car movie (with all apologies to Redline 7000, a pretty good stock car movie and a template for this flick).  The streak continues, as yeoman effort by able cast can't overcome the silliness of the plot.  Cruise is fine as brash newcomer to Nascar, and Duvall is great as always as his crew chief haunted by past failures.  But the Nascar advisor must have been sleeping, or ill or something when they did the actual racing scenes.  And the romantic plot-line just doesn't click.  As a stock car fan, I'm still waiting."
"CWP-","5","0","1","16 September 1999"," Enjoyable film similar to Top Gun in many ways
","My Age: 13<br/><br/>Cole Trickle, played by Tom Cruise, enters the world of Nascar driving in Days of Thunder.  Making his cars and telling him how to drive them (as he knows almost nothing about cars) is Harry Hogge, played by Robert Duvall, and owning his team is Tim Daland, played by Randy Quaid.  After a bad accident on the track colliding with rival driver Rowdy Burns' car, he falls in love with a doctor at the hospital, played by Nicole Kidman.  He and Rowdy Burns, played by Michael Rooker, also become friends.<br/><br/>Days of Thunder has many things in common with the earlier film Top Gun. First it has the same producers, Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, and the same star, Tom Cruise.  The style of the films are also very similar.  Both the films are also quite fun.  I found Days of Thunder to be slightly better than Top Gun.  Robert Duvall's acting performance was very good, and the friendship between Rowdy Burns and Trickle was also a nice touch.  The ending climax is fairly exciting, yet the film isn't fantastic.<br/><br/>Australian Classification: M 15+: Occasional Coarse Language<br/><br/>Rating: 66 out of 100"

","Probably one of the worst movies on auto racing you'll ever find. If you're a Tom Cruise/ Nicole Kidman fan, then you can put yourself through the misery, otherwise you'd be better off watching the CannonBall run. Despite such a great cast, this movie is a flop.4/10."
"Anonymous_Maxine","8","0","1","5 May 2002"," Days of Thunder has all the typical ingredients of every other Bruckheimer production ever made, except that it actually works in this case.
","It's very easy to be put off by Bruckheimer productions (like Armageddon, Gone In 60 Seconds, Pearl Harbor, Coyote freakin Ugly, etc.), and Days of Thunder undeniably fits comfortably among them, but this is inarguably one of the better of the films that have come from the juggernaut producer. Bruckheimer is obviously more interested in making astronomical amounts of money than he is in inserting any type of artistic merit into the films that he produces, which is generally what causes them to come out as complete garbage (see all of the movies listed above). In the case of Days of Thunder, however, we have a film that displays all of the characteristics of the average Bruckheimer production, but that manages to avoid becoming yet another emotionally manipulative and generally weak film outside of the obviously massive financial purging that went into every element of the film except the story, the script, and the artistic input.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, a Bruckheimer veteran, plays the part of Cole Trickle, a smart-ass rookie who decides that he wants to race for Nascar despite massive ignorance about the functional workings of the cars themselves.  We get a brief look into his past in an emotion-tinged scene with his mentor, Harry (Robert Duvall), in which he gives us a sketch of his reasons for wanting to race Nascar, leaving the details at a minimum because they are not very important to the rest of the movie. The important thing here is the question of whether Cole can prove himself on the racetrack, and he gets his opportunity several times with varying degrees of success and failure.<br/><br/>Almost identical on a structural level to it's predecessor, Top Gun, Days of Thunder manages to avoid becoming redundant as a result of the inevitable comparisons to that film, and instead succeeds in much the same way that Top Gun did. Again, we are given a fast paced story that involves an exciting occupation that most people know little about (this time Nascar racing instead of fighter piloting), with all of the same stock characters that seem to succeed in the film even though logic would seem to prevent this, given the lack of imagination involved in their conception and their behaviors. <br/><br/>Much of the extensive and generally appreciated comic relief in the film involves things that could never be done in real life without massive consequences, which renders it amusing but impossible to take seriously. Maybe the reason that the movie was so enjoyable was the very fact that the comic relief alone removed any sense that the film is meant to be taken seriously. On public roads, Cole and Rowdy (Michael Rooker) engage in a high speed race in rental cars, Cole backs into an impatient tailgater and then chases him at high speeds through the streets, and on the racetrack Cole has his flattened tires changed by his pit crew after the checkered flag has waved, and then plows full speed into the race victor, who also happens to be the guy who caused Cole's flat tires and his subsequent removal from the race. Was nobody at Nascar watching any of this?<br/><br/>Sure, these were all a ton of fun to watch, but they all occurred entirely without consequences of any kind. The guy that he backed into and then chased through the streets continued on his way without seeming to care as much about the damage done to his car as he is about getting on with whatever business made it was that made him in such a hurry in the first place. And, obviously, as was extensively the case with Top Gun, Cole can't be expected to have any respect for helmet laws. Hey kids, Tom Cruise never wears helmets in his movies when he's on motorcycles (and this isn't even including the Missions: Impossible), so maybe we shouldn't either? Here's a good example of how weak filmmaking can try to be cool in ways that set a brilliant example for all of its young viewers.  <br/><br/>Nicole Kidman plays the role of Cole's and Rowdy's neurologist with deadly seriousness, emphasizing both her own role as the tamer of the wild Cole and Cruise's role as the out of control rookie seeking desperately to find something to control. He at first finds speed in a Nascar as that thing to control, but then turns his attention gradually to his doctor, ultimately having to come to the decision of which he wants more. Obviously, anyone who has ever seen a movie knows exactly what he's going to choose, but there is an interesting discrepancy here, because while we can pretend that there is some suspense in his decision, given that neither thing has been in his life for very long (and, therefore, we can try to wonder which has become more important to him), there is also the absence of suspense for that same reason. <br/><br/>Robert Duvall is just as good as always in his role as the retired mechanic behind the scenes at the races (brought back from his leaisurely retirement by the age-old `one more job' routine), and even Randy Quaid (who may never overcome his brilliant performance as Cousin Eddie in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation) manages to come across as convincingly serious at times. Besides that, he was the only person throughout the entire movie that offered up some consequences to some of Cole's reckless behaviors (screaming out, after Cole's vengeful crash into Russ Wheeler's car after that race, that the entire team was fired √Ç‚Äì although it should be noted that that clearing of his list of employees was never enforced or even mentioned again). <br/><br/>Days of Thunder is a fast action film that delivers what it promises, while at the same time retaining the generally unimpressive characteristics of your typical Jerry Bruckheimer film. It takes a sport that is hideously boring (unless you're involved in it or the cars are crashing into each other) and makes it interesting, despite being at the expense of that sport's connection with reality. While it's definitely not a realist film, Days of Thunder is inarguably one of the best of the action films to come from the Bruckheimer production team."
"Scufovo","Null","0","1","20 March 2001"," Doesn't live up to the sum of it's parts.
","OK, if you know absolutely nothing about racing, it's just 'Topgun' with cars.  Not bad, in fact, a tolerable action movie.  Cruise isn't bad, and Duvall is always a delight.  Michael Rooker is excellent, and the rest of the ensemble turns in solid performances.  (Note exception below.)  Ah, but then we get to the writing.  If you possess even the slightest bit of racing knowledge, it's an offense.  While there is some bumping and banging going on on most racetracks, no one states that it's their intention to put anyone into the wall at Daytona.  Plus, sorry, but Nicole Kidman can't act.  Let me rephrase, she COULD'NT act.  She has improved by 1000%, see her in 'Malice' for a standout performance.  But here?  NO, I don't think so."
