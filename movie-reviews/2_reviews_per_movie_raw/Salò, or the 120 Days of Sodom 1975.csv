","Pier Paolo Pasolini, as is well known, was murdered not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of SALO begs the question - had he not been murdered, would he have taken his own life anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Pasolini was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of DeSade's most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Second World War with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, SALO also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Pasolini hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning 'banquet of s**t' as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to SALO expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, SALO has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. SALO comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but SALO is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it."

","It appears most people find this movie to be sick, pointless, and without substance. That's unfair.<br/><br/>This is the strongest movie I've ever seen, and it made an IMPORTANT impression on me, a big horrorflick-devotee. It made me question a lot of things about former favourite films, and made me realize how sick it is to make horror and violence into entertainment. The problem with most movies is that violence is not portrayed violent enough, horror isn't portrayed horrible enough. Most 'thriller' films have these ingredients softened so that people can enjoy it, and THAT'S sick. This movie is SANE. It shows horror and violence as it IS - totally revolting and disgusting.<br/><br/>I sat as on needles for 1 hour 40 minutes, and felt really bad watching this film. It grossed me out, but I understood why this film is both good and important. It gives a sane perspective on violence, as opposed to SICK, SICK Hollywood-action where people get killed by 'heroes' and nobody raises an eyebrow."
"BackFire83","8","215","245","29 May 2007"," A Film of Rage and Sadness
","Salo, the final film by Pasolini, is far and away the most affecting film I've ever seen of it's type. The images that it shows will stay with every viewer forever, they are unforgettable. Yet, you will wish you could forget them.<br/><br/>The film is about a group of rich Fascists during WWII-Nazi Occupied Italy, where they kidnap a group of 18 youngsters, allowing only physically perfect specimins to stay, and subject them to various forms of mental, physical and sexual torture over the next 120 Days. The torture starts off in a sexual nature--Sodomy, rape, humiliation and so on-- and slowly degrades and descends into mental and physical torture. Just when you think what you are seeing can't get worse, it does, ten-fold.<br/><br/>What makes Salo so brutally shocking and disturbing is its uncompromised and blunt way of showing the acts of horror. It is a very quiet and slow film, mostly shot using static and still cameras, it feels more like a documentary than a fictional film. It's clear upon viewing, that Pasolini wanted to remind us all that violence should not be entertainment. As such, every act of violence and degredation is drained of all its possible energy and excitement, and shown in a sad, painful light. Nothing is sugar coated, nothing is softened. This film is an attack on our desensitized feelings towards violence. Yet, at the same time, the film purposely desensitizes us to certain acts -- Such as rape. We see it so much during the film that it becomes ""normality"" to us, we barely raise an eyebrow. Upon realizing this, one also realizes how the horrible acts shown in the film are possible, and it's a terrible realization.<br/><br/>Salo continues to descend until at the end, when we are taken to the punishing grounds, where various rule breakers are tortured and murdered. This final sequence is the most harrowing and effective I've ever seen in a film. As the victims are tortured and murdered, each one of the fascist rulers take turns as voyer, watching from a second story window, far enough away to not hear the screams of terror and pain. And we watch with him. The film attempts to equate our viewing of this film to their viewing of the executions, after all, we're watching these acts for ""entertainment"", just as he is. And we distance ourselves from the acts in order to enjoy them, as he does by watching through binoculars far away. It's a savage and truthful attack, one that is impossible to deny. <br/><br/>Also incredibly unsettling is the inherent joy that the villains (Heroes?) feel at their victims pain, sadness and discomfort. Sometimes even to the point of sexual arousal. There is a scene where a girl is crying because her mother died trying to save her from these people. She is completely naked as she weeps, to us, she's the picture of vulnerability and sadness, to the fascists, it's the most exciting thing they've seen all day. The fascists all stand and watch her weep with the utmost sexualexcitement. It is terrifying. It's scenes like these that set Salo apart from other ""gross out"" movies. Some of the most affecting and frightening scenes are ones where there is quiet, watching the expressions and reactions of people to the various horrible acts. <br/><br/>Salo is a film of rage and sadness. It is a film that asks you to hate humanity, to hate what we're capable of; to look in the mirror and hate yourself. Then weep because nothing can be done about it. Nothing will ever change.."
"futures-1","8","210","261","6 June 2005"," One of the roughest films you'll ever see.
","""Salo: The 120 Days of Sodom"" (1975): Be prepared for one of the roughest films you'll ever see. This was Pasolini's last, and going by what I've seen, his vision only became bleaker and more disturbed as the years clawed along. Using the Marquis de Sade's ideas on the decadence of 18th century France, Pasolini represents Fascist Italy (1944-45). We are shown the upper class  always removed and protected from the outer world  as predators of the poor, weak, young, and less educated. A group of wealthy adults shop amongst the kidnapped older children of bourgeoisie. They choose eighteen, and steal them away to a hidden mansion, where there is no escape. There, the adults live out every twisted fantasy they've ever had or can now muster, while demeaning, raping, and torturing the youngsters. The teens react in many ways, none of which are ""pretty"". This entire film experience MUST be viewed as a symbolic, emotional ""explanation"" of what it was like to live under Nazi/Fascist rule (in this case), and how an otherwise normal, decent society could be turned into lunatics and sub-animals. Although made 30 years ago (with the usual weaker production qualities of that era), I cannot think of another work which so blatantly and painfully illustrates what those in power are capable of doing when boredom gives rein to impulse. In comparison, ""Lord of the Flies"" barely lights upon these issues, ""Pink Flamingos"" was but a tiny, kitschy springboard, and ""Schindler's List"" described a much narrower range of degradation. To this day, ""Salo: "" is banned in some countries. This is NOT a film about acting, lighting, sound, camera work, etc.. This is a film about states of mind  theirs then, ours now. P.S.: If you are interested in set design, this one is FILLED with original Cubist/Bauhaus/Futurist/Moderne furnishings, murals, and art. Spectacular. Those styles were not yet being reproduced, so Pasolini used the real thing. There is also an interesting use of a Charles Rennie MacIntosh chairwhich will alter how you see this design from here on out."
"renelsonantonius","6","242","311","19 April 2002"," Did Pasolini really ""wallow in his own sensationalism""?
","With Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo,"" the long-disputed issue of the extent to which a filmmaker can interpret a story on screen has been put to the ultimate test.And when ""extreme"" cases do happen, do the censors become ""morally"" justified in interfering with the filmmaker's ""creative freedom""?<br/><br/>There are a good number of films that can be used to illustrate the issues raised:Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""Santa Sangre"" can be a case in point regarding the subject of violence and gore (a mentally-disturbed serial murderer and his domineering mother, with surreal images and subtle attacks on the Catholic faith),while Nagisa Oshima's ""In the Realm of the Senses"" can be a point of reference regarding the subject of sex and nudity (a couple---a geisha and a tradesman---who has practically made sexual intercourse the be-all and end-all of their lives, to the point of obsession and possessiveness).<br/><br/>On the other hand, Pasolini's film shows both ""flesh and blood.""<br/><br/>The opening credits, with the accompaniment of a soft-sounding music, and the opening shot of a calm body of water, with a palace (turns out to belong to the high officials) viewed from afar, are deceiving:what follows from thereon is definitely not soothing to one's senses.Set in World War II Italy, where Benito Mussolini's Nazi-Fascist regime is very much in power, the film depicts the ways in which the dictator's high-standing minions are capable of degrading and brutalizing the citizens,particularly the youth, just to satisfy some perverted and homo-erotic desires.<br/><br/>The film is divided in four parts (or ""chapters,"" if one may call them so, since the film, it's significant to say, is based on a novel by Marquis de Sade, a controversial and provocative man of letters during his time),where each one represents the stages in which the young, innocent and gentle are deliberately and systematically corrupted and destroyed by the supposed-to-be leaders and guardians of the state---it's like hungry wolves feeding on gentle lambs.<br/><br/>""Antechamber of Hell"" shows how a number of young people, most of them beautiful and fresh, are rounded up, brought to the palace and oriented with the ""rules and regulations"" that are to govern their existence within the chamber of power---upon hearing them, one gets the impression that this might just be what hell really is.<br/><br/>""Circle of Obsessions"" has the state officials weaving tales of eroticism and sensuality to arouse themselves and the youth into making some of the most perverted sexual acts---unabashed nudity, autoeroticism, hedonism, lasciviousness and homoeroticism are strewn all over.<br/><br/>""Circle of Shit"" illustrates a further debasement:feeding on others' and one's own excrement (there's even a scene where one of the officials lets a young woman urinate right into his mouth) as, if I understand it right, a gesture of wholly accepting the ""evil"" in all of us---the ""stench,"" to be taken literally and figuratively.The images may truly repel the viewers:a graphic act of defecation, close-up shots of feces (and what a heap!) and the notoriously unforgettable mock wedding reception.<br/><br/>Finally, ""Circle of Blood"" takes the viewers to ""salo""---the punishing ground, where the young boys and girls who broke some of the ""rules and regulations"" are ""taught their lesson"" by the men in power.Again, this part is excruciating to watch, for the viewers become witness to some of the most brutally painful acts of punishment:how about an eye being removed, just to give a sample?<br/><br/>Now, was Pasolini ""guilty"" of, to use film critic Leonard Maltin's words, ""wallowing in his own sensationalism""? I've yet to read the book on which the film is based, but someone told me that the Italian filmmaker was just being faithful to De Sade's work.Meaning to say, Pasolini tried as much as possible to express visually what the French novelist expressed in words.True, ""Salo"" in its entirety is an extremely offensive and shocking film, the kind to which the moviegoing adage ""Just sit back and relax"" won't definitely apply.But then, isn't that the kind of response that the film's theme and images should elicit from the viewers in the first place?<br/><br/>Not to be disoriented and enraged by the lowest depths into which man's (ab)use of power and satisfaction of primitive cravings and desires can plunge is one of the most absurd things that can ever happen.We should really appreciate artists (directors, novelists, poets, etc.) who have the courage and commitment (an abundance of them, it must be) to explore ""extreme possiblities"" inherent in human life.Life isn't always like ""a box full of chocolates""---sweet and comforting---is it?<br/><br/>If it ever happens that ""the people concerned"" get alarmed, raise concerns about a film and eventually mangle, if not ban, it, it may only prove that the film hits right where it should."
"dennis70","10","280","376","16 March 2005"," A necessary evil
","This is a tough one. Pasolini was a very complicated man. He was murdered in still-unexplained circumstances shortly after the film was completed. I was 10 years old when this movie was finished, but I only saw it now. Despite being almost 30 years old, Salo is probably the most cruel and repulsive film ever made, not just here in Italy but in the whole world. It depicts the worse atrocities inflicted to humans by humans. The true dark side of human nature: When evil is born out of simple boredom, when it comes naturally. It is a film that I don't want to see ever again, but at the same time I'm glad it was made. I thought hated it at first, but I now I realized is not true. Of course I don't love it either. I can't decide how to judge it. I don't like the cinematography or the acting. But it was definitely one of the most profound emotional experiences of revulsion I've had in a film. It is a necessary evil if you can endure it."
"Ky-D","10","158","209","26 March 2005"," A film of true power.
","Given the depraved nature of this film, a 10 rating may seem a touch high. To be certain, the film has it's share of disgusting moments, yet those are not the core of the film. The central soul of this movie is the over-riding sense of hopelessness. I would call it Schiendler's List's evil little brother. But where as Spielbergs film was about the triumph of the human spirit under horrible conditions, Paolini's vision looks at the bottomless depths that the human creature can fall.<br/><br/>Set during Fascist era Italy, a group of wealthy party members gather up a collection of young men and women to use as entertainment. Taking advice from an aging former madam, they re-enact her most debauched stories of perversion in an amplified manner. Things move in a down-ward spiral until the inevitable breaking point: a girl is caught breaking the rules of behavior and in an effort to lighten her punishment, turns in another rule-breaker, who in turn does the same and so on and such forth.<br/><br/>Despite the films reputation, it isn't particularly graphic. While there is an abundance of nudity there is little of no ""normal"" sex. There are some scenes of bloody violence, but those happen mostly near the end. What makes this film so disturbing isn't what you see so much as what you feel. There is no hope for these poor people, neither the Facists nor their prisoners; every one is doomed to madness or death. The final shot of the movie is really the most uncomfortable of the whole film, yet it is so mundane, just a simple shot of two boys practicing dancing and asking each other about their girlfriends. To understand why that is so unnerving, you have to see it in context.<br/><br/>This is definitely not a film for everyone, or even most people. I consider myself pretty jaded to disturbing cinema and I still walked away with an uneasy feeling, akin to losing all faith in humanity. There is nothing cheesy nor fun about the happenings here.<br/><br/>A film I am glad to have seen once, but hope to never watch again.<br/><br/>10/10"
"maxbemba","Null","42","53","24 March 2001"," A LAST MESSAGE
","Reportedly, when the executives of one, now defunct, American film company saw ""Saló"", which they helped co-finance and had distribution rights on, they were so disturbed and embarrassed that they didn't know what to do. Are we going to release this thing?  With our company name on it?  Where?<br/><br/>
They had to show that they released it somewhere in the U.S. or territories.<br/><br/>So they did.  In a small theater in El Condado area near San Juan, Puerto Rico.  <br/><br/>There's where I saw it.  In the mid-70's.  With the film company's name on it.  <br/><br/>Is it any good?  Well, I'm no great admirer of Pasolini.  Frankly, I find his movies intolerable.  And ""Saló"" is no exception.  But, unlike his Trilogy of Life (""The Decameron"", ""Canterbury Tales"", ""Arabian Nights"") where he at least displayed some flair and humor, this one is a different animal.  <br/><br/>His style was always somewhat ponderous.  In ""Saló"" it is heavily, oppressively didactic: static tableaux-style framing, a deliberately slow pace, no humor whatsoever, and actors who don't play characters but conceits.  Although Pasolini uses De Sade's ""120 Days of Sodom"" as scaffolding and as a pointed commentary, ""Saló"" is actually based on real events that happened in the Republic of Saló in Northern Italy, where a group of wealthy fascists abducted a large group of young men and women, went on to debase them, and after they were done with them they killed them. Pasolini staged all the scenes as demonstrations of degradation and cruelty.  And he does not flinch.  <br/><br/>At the end he includes a bibliography.  <br/><br/>It's an unpleasant experience.  <br/><br/>Clearly, Pasolini, an award-winning poet and one of the leading intellectuals of his time, was very angry when he did this moving picture. He wanted to send a message to Italy and to the world. <br/><br/>
It was his last film.  <br/><br/>Months later he was murdered.  <br/><br/>After several weeks of being in release, the theater was raided by our local vice authorities."
"johnmichael-2","10","57","76","17 February 2008"," Soul crushing--recommended very highly to a very few
","I watched this film late one night (after my parents were in bed), and for a while it was merely uncomfortable to sit through. The actors weren't particularly emotional, the sets weren't hugely exciting, and the storyline consisted of four libertines and their accomplices listening to dirty stories and doing dirty things to their child victims.<br/><br/>And yet, halfway through this blasé piece, I began crying. It was, I believe, at a part where the whore was telling one her sick stories while dancing with the libertine, and she begins laughing as if it is the funniest thing in the world. And yet the laugh sounds false--not just false, but hopeless. I cried off and on (though more on than off) the rest of the film, and from now on I cannot think about ""Salo"" without tearing up; I am trying not to cry even as I write this.<br/><br/>What makes ""Salo"" the most disturbing film I have ever watched, no competition? It is not the acts depicted--the coprophilia, the torture, the murder, the betrayal. It is that supreme and utter hopelessness behind the whore's laugh. It is the insatiable desires of the libertines, constantly fed and yet never quenched. It is the victims who are willing to sell each other out in order to escape just a little bit more torture before their inevitable death.<br/><br/>The novel described the four libertines as being people who not only did as much evil as they possibly could, but also as people who went out of their way to avoid doing anything virtuous. Pier Paolo Pasolini has extended this bleak outlook to the entire human race. The entire film is soaked with his utter hatred and disgust for humanity--nobody in this film has a redeeming side, not even the victims. Everyone in this film is going to die--even the libertines, sometime after the film comes to its conclusion, are going to be tried for war crimes as part of the Fascist regime. Pasolini paints a portrait of the human race as a race that is wallowing in the lowest depths of misery as it drags itself towards its own demise.<br/><br/>There is no moral to this story. Pasolini figures that the human race will merely ignore the moral if he tries to give one. Neither does he try to spruce up this film with interesting acting or camera-work. The direction is bland and the cinematography is largely static--and therein lies its greatest (or is it its worst?) talent. It is as if Pasolini is looking up at the human race from behind the camera, his face gaunt and hopeless, considering the various ways to spice up the scene before saying: ""Why bother? You are worthless; this film will not satisfy your desires, whatever they may be.""<br/><br/>Which leads me to one last question: how the heck did I give this 10 stars? And how the heck can I possibly recommend it to any of you? It was upsetting, disturbing, and appalling. And yet it has changed my life--for the better? For the worse? Does is crush my hopes for humanity, or does it give me an understanding of its darkest facets and how best to avoid them? Look, people, I don't rightly know! I'm still figuring it out!<br/><br/>To most of you: stay the heck away from this film. But to a few of you--a very, very few--those few that want to see this movie for more than its shock value, those few that are willing to explore humanity's darkest recesses, those few that are not mainstream moviegoers and are actually willing to think--I recommend, no I BEG you to watch ""Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom."" You will never forget it."

","I'm going to keep this short. If you want to see Salo simply to see what all the hype is about, keep your $600. Or rent it. If you can find it. I happen to own the Criterion release that is now being ripped and sold on Ebay for $400-600 bucks. Is it worth it? No. Is any film? No. Is it an excellent film? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Try not to think of Pasolini's masterpiece as a shock-for-shock's sake project and you'll truly understand the horror that is Salo. While the depiction of violence, sodomy, corpophagia, eye-gouging, scalping, nipple burning with candles, etc. etc. is horrific it is Pasolini's treatment of the boys and girls that is much more horrifying.<br/><br/>The monsters that occupy this small space of two hours, the fascists, are more human that their victims. We are given no insight into the lives of these children, while we are shown at great length the heads of state personal histories and sadistic proclivities.<br/><br/>Salo has stood the test of time because of it's unflinching portrayal of human violence and idealism, and the fact that, as the Criterion collection states: ""Moral redemption may be nothing but a myth."" Be warned: for many, Salo is a film not easily shaken off after a single viewing."
"Mattydee74","Null","220","347","29 May 2001"," This film is a political act. Don't buy the lies.
","It is pointless, insulting, and redundant to buy into the defence/condemnation dynamic that Pier Paolo Pasolini's testament so snidely provokes and invites.  In making what will remain one of the darkest and most vicious films ever made, Pasolini's bleak vision at the time of this films production in 1975  wanted to make the point that we are not free. We are limited by social  restraints and political conditioning which makes us no better than the victims in this  powerful, shattering cinema experience. That Pasolini was murdered by a male hustler in JFK-worthy circumstances - before he had time to  utterly complete and polish the film -  is an apt reminder of the forces of censorship and their merciless, cruel satisfaction in maintaining blank and reprehensible silences.<br/><br/>I refuse to join in the disinfecting and antiseptic treatments that people calling themselves supporters have applied to this film.  There are moments of eroticism, beauty and even dark humour in this film and those who seek to castrate and deny Pasolini  his humanity and complexity by pretending otherwise are naive if not duplicitous with those who placed this film in the category of ""banned"" in Australia.  To deny Pasolini  the distinction of having created a multiple, difficult film with various levels of engagement is to reduce his profound legacy.<br/><br/>Pasolini made this film to make people think hard and harshly  and to contemplate themselves.  The darkness of the cinema is part of that indictment and denying Pasolini this space for his film is pure evil. He was a disgusted and angry man and this film shares the passions, disapointments and loves of Pasolini. He wanted to change things.  To help people. To provoke and make us ponder and contemplate ideas and arguments.  That some will not is no revelation. But this is not some far off  distant story - Salo is a political electric shock  treatment as relevant today and tommorrow as upon its initial release (or non-release as may be the case). Its his most lavish and grand film and also his most  personal.  Throughout the film we are reminded that this microcosm of society implicates us - our surveillance of the events in this film is an act of violence and violation. Words are weapons wielded by the Duke and his merry bandits as they systematically annihilate the young people under their pointless control.<br/><br/>
Pasolini is throwing Salo at us with the pride and courage of  a protestor throwing excrement at a politician. This film is a political act. Australia is as dangerous  a country as those  demonised  ""foreign"" countries with more extreme , exploitable examples of political censorship.  Thankfully this film is available in Australia from certain sources but it remains denied its rightful place in the cinema theatre and  general, legal release. But at least it can still be seen. The resistance continues.  Like the young man who raises his arm in salute against his captors in Salo in the most dire and deadly circumstances. I do the same to Pasolini in less deadly but no less dire circumstance.  To one of our greatest modern philosophers and visionaries, Pier Paolo Pasolini, we should be truly thankful."
"myboigie","10","174","274","25 December 2005"," Salo is now, Gladio is real
","So you say you've seen nearly-every major Italian-giallo? You've seen Argento, Mario Bava, Lucio Fulci, Michele Soavi, and even all the ""classics"" of Italian-film? Leone, Fellini, DeSicca, Bertolucci, Martino, and even most of the ""world-classics""? By this point, you've probably seen-it-all, and you think there is no film that will shock you? If you haven't seen Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo"", you are wrong. Pasolini didn't even live to see the film widely-released--he was murdered by a male-hustler (or so the official-story plays). Pier Pasolini was the most-important post-war intellectual in Italy, period. Like a Renaissance polymath, he was adept at journalism, the novel, poetry, screen writing, directing motion-pictures, and more. His revolutionary-philosophy was against fascism and communism, and he had many enemies in the political-arena, as well as the religious. All-said, however, it's likely that Pier Pasolini was murdered by a right-wing assassination-team under the aegis of ""gladio"", a NATO program of secret-armies through Western Europe. Gladio began, ostensibly, as a defense-against a hypothetical Soviet-invasion of Europe, but was used to attack legitimate Leftist political-parties and groups. The Red Brigade bombings in the 1970s were even instigated-by gladio-operatives to justify a law-and-order crackdown of the Italian Communist Party--it is a mystery as to how-much CIA-influence this all had. The P-2 conspiracy (oddly, involving the Vatican, the CIA, KGB, and renegade Freemasons!) had yet-to-break. There were dozens of politically-motivated killings in 1970s-Italy, and Pasolini's was one-of-many. One has to wonder how-much involvement the Vatican had in his murder, as well.<br/><br/>And so, ""Salo"" enters this bloody-fray. It could not be any more controversial on all-fronts, and is a shout-of-rage against how little we all care about human-life itself. Pasolini was outraged and disappointed with the human-condition, and Italian politics had become chaos--leading Sergio Leone to remark at the time that, ""Italian politics have become ridiculous."" The scenario of Salo is fairly-simple: a group of Italian-fascists retreat to a palace in Northern Italy (where there was a great-deal of support for Italian fascism and the Monarch) with a group of sixteen boys and girls. It is the short-lived Republic of Salo, hence the title that any Italian of the 1970s would recognize. For 120-days, they degrade them in almost every-imaginable-way. Gay-rape, buggery, forcing people to eat-excrement, and finally, death. Of course, it's all based-loosely on DeSade's tale and stays pretty-closely to the text's themes and scenarios. He ""chapters"" each section with some of the structure of Dante's ""Inferno"", which is genius. To say this film is merely a statement on fascism would be wrong, it is a manifesto on what cruelty rests within all human-hearts. Pasolini understood that, under the right-circumstances, we are all capable of these depredations. Some reviewers have stated they didn't find the film shocking--they should check-themselves into a clinic somewhere. I've noticed that even friends who are into such directors as Takashi Miike, respect the power of this film. Miike has some similarities-in-style with Pasolini, but goes for a more genre, stylized-look. Even John Waters lists this film as sicker than his worst-offenders! To say I was shocked would be an understatement.<br/><br/>Besides being pretty sick, this film looks pretty-good. The late Tonnino Colli's (who also worked-for Fellini and Leone) photography lends the film a look that could be hung in the Louvre, and it gives the film a greater subversive-edge. It should be noted that the film is not ""legitimately-available"" in the United State for copyright reasons. However, there are very-good copies out-there since it is not in-print. I found one that is an exact-duplicate of the original US-edition for a decent-price, so it is out there, with some searching. The Criterion edition is reportedly the most-expensive DVD in the world, going for as-much as $600.00 USD. Criterion's is the best-transfer we have to-date. I've got a few Ken Russell DVDs (""Salome's Last Dance"")that are worth as-much as $300.00 USD, so this is a shocker! It's funny to see used DVDs of the big Hollywood-fare at $3.99 USD, while these are in-the-hundreds! It says-a-lot about what is lasting and meaningful to people, and it ain't blockbuster movies. A company called ""Water Bearer"" has sets of Pasolini's other works, but I have it on good-word that they are inferior-quality. It would be nice if Criterion did a Pasolini Box that included a newer-transfer of ""Salo"" with restoration. It is one of the most-important films ever made. We all stand-accused, even the filmmaker, and that's the point. Be warned: not for children or adults who fear soul-searing, raw-existentialism.<br/><br/>NOTE: The ""ass-judging-scene"" is similar to photos of the ""flesh-pyramid"" at Abu-Ghraib. http://chickasawpicklesmell.blogspot.com/"
"Ariel6","Null","37","53","22 November 2001"," Not a Film about Fascism at all
","Pasolini made it quite clear in several texts that this is not an anti-fascist film, but rather that fascism is a symbol for something far more pervasive. He ultimately saw himself as a committed director, and thus all of his historical films are about the present, and this film was made in the 70's, not in the 40's. It is rather an anti-bourgeois film. (Pasolini's political enemies at the time were not fascists at all, but the Christian Democrats)...Furthermore it is NOT a defense of Sade, but an apology for his earlier writings and films which mythicized acts of violence and glorified them as the pure, unconscious, pre-verbal expression of the subproletariat. However Pasolini saw the riots of the bourgeois students in 1968 as nihilistic acts of revolt, not revolution--a revolt of the Bourgeoise against itself, as his poetry makes clear. He watched in horror as he saw his vision of true revolution twisted into a childish and merely destructive tantrum against the previous generation. And so it is the Bourgeoise, symbolized by Fascism, which he represents and condemns in Salo, in the guise of what he considered to be a medieval morality play. And it is in this context that he apologizes for having made statements like ""Only a bloodbath can save the world"" (1962), which is quoted in the film. Yet, like everything else, it has been appropriated by the bourgeoise, who misinterpret it first as Nietzsche, then as St. Paul, until it gets reduced to a merely absurdist Dada interpretation. The characters are continually misinterpreting the many structuralist citations, because they have no history. History has been destroyed, and thus Pasolini is trying to re-introduce it in the film. The revolution, by 1968, was impossible, as there was nobody left to fight it. The bourgeoise, Pasolini lamented, had subsumed everything into itself-there was no ""other"", only a technological god-like and all-inclusive power structure. But what is most shocking is that it is the Sadean libertarianism and the permissivness of that class that Pasolini finds most disturbing. He held that the permissiveness of the ""anarchy of power"" was more tyrannical than repression. He was most traumitized, oddly, by the increasing tolerance of homosexuals. And so truely Pasolini takes the side of Dante, not Sade. And finally, its ultimately a film about misinterpretation. What the characters say and what they do (as in Sade) are incongruent. He knew that he was to be misunderstood by his Bourgeois audience, as it misunderstood itself, Pasolini said that it was intrinsic that Salo remain enigmatic (on the model of Dante), and this is the film's real genius. Judging by most of these reviews, Pasolini made his point."

"Quinoa1984","6","23","32","8 July 2004"," It's not necessarily a film, per say, as it is an endurance test...
","...meaning that if a viewer can stay tuned, as I could, through the ""Circle of Sh*t"" segment, then a viewer can sit through just about anything that's on celluloid. It's indeed appropriate that it's called the most disturbing and disgusting film ever made, as it well could be. As I watched all the way through till the end I got the same feeling as I did watching Mel Gibson's The Passion of the Christ. Both films go out on a limb with excesses (although Gibson's excesses were arguably not as faithful to the source as Pasolini was), and I have to say that at least from an objective point of view Pier Paolo Pasolini gets the job done there. With great cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli (Once Upon a Time in the West) providing the sometimes exquisite camera-work and lighting, Ennio Morricone delivering a slight, but melodic tone in the background, and with interesting sets, plus an interesting editing style that doesn't entirely show as much of the grotesque and sex as it could've, the craft behind the film is pretty good. If one were to look past the subject matter, it's actually a very well constructed piece of film art, which is why many consider it important.<br/><br/>I suppose it's a unique film, but you couldn't pay me to want to watch it again (unless it was in a film class where the teacher proved himself to have reason to have us watch it). At the core, Salo: 120 Days of Sodom, is interesting as a concept, from which it was taken from Sade's novel - a group of f*cked up fascists during the end of world war two capture some young boys and girls and force them to go under sexual and mental tortures. As in the book (which I've never read and don't really have a desire to seek out at this point in my life), the acts are relentless, and in between the fascists instilling fear and intense degradation, a woman narrates stories that go over and over as she describes everything from eating excrement to helping out a grown man in diapers. By the end, it's a controlled chaos as most are dead and those who aren't look on with binoculars. Now, the problem is with this material, at least for me, it becomes very subjective.<br/><br/>I can see the core point PPP's making (it's almost like a twisted satire), and it does remind me how much fascism is the worst kind of ideology there is on Earth...But then the relentlessness of it all becomes very, very close to unbearable (i.e. endurance test). And, reminding me again of 'The Passion', Salo doesn't give any of the characters any other kinds of emotions to work in than those they're stuck with. There's no deviating from the paths and fates of the characters, and without any point of entry into the victims (the exclusion being two girls, who all they say are 'I can't take this anymore' to each other), they're left with the controlled state that the villains have put them in. I suppose the acting by these four, vicious bastards is commendable, but after a while the acts that they thrust upon the kids stops being shocking, and becomes boring. And when a film that is supplied with a talented crew and cast that does whatever PPP tells them to do, and it's boring, it doesn't work for me. The stories by the one woman, in-particular, tend to drag on as her character seems to just think up new ways to entice the heads of the manor into ecstasy. On top of this, there isn't logic to history because if this is towards the end of the war, where are the allies putting a stop to the fascists?<br/><br/>I guess, in the end, I found Salo to be one of the more difficult films I've ever seen. I know I'm sort of glad I got through with it, but by the end I realized that PPP committed a bit of a film crime (though certainly not deserving of his mysterious death before the film was released) - there's no room for catharsis. This could be argued by some, however I'd have to say that if there was one it was buried underneath all of the sh*t food and *ss raping. Because the film is a bit one-dimensional, and hope is a lost cause, by the end all one could reasonably be left with is emptiness. In a way it reminded me of Bergman's Cries and Whispers in how it's just a sea of bleakness and despair for everyone involved, but at least in Bergman's bleak world there are moments of sweet (if maybe brief) humanity and love. I can't recommend Salo except for extreme, die-hard film buffs and for nihilistic types (and maybe for those interested in understanding the nature of fascism), and for those looking for what's worse after Gibson's POTC. It's definitely deserved, either way you take the film, as one of the most notorious, soul-churning pieces ever produced, though I wouldn't say it's one of the worst."

","""Salo,"" despite the time and place it is set in, has absolutely nothing to do with fascism or war.  Nor is it a narrative of any kind.<br/><br/>Instead, it is a presentation of a very disturbing philosophy - Man has no kind nature.  They prey on the most vulnerable amongst themselves, and only those with no sense of pride and a willingness to become predators as well survive to the very end.  In the end, everybody is in it for themselves.<br/><br/>Sometimes Pasolini delivers his message with creepy minimalism.  But mostly he prefers to give it to the viewer in a manner as subtle as a brick in the head.<br/><br/>Pasolini's persistance on showing only the darkest corners of human nature and his complete denial that anything else even exists creates a very dark and incredibly disturbing picture.  It is also the biggest pitfall of ""Salo"".  It could have been a far greater and much more powerful film if Pasolini allowed at least a single slightest ray of light into the infinitely pessimistic philosophy that he portrays here.<br/><br/>However, the way it ended up was as a cry that human kindness does not exist (which pretty much was how it was intended, after all).  In the final scene, he states that the viewer has every bit of potential to be just as evil and predatory as the four fascists in this movie.  A very powerful and thoughtful statement, actually, one that any human being should not deny.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a very intelligent and disturbing motion picture, one that forces the viewer to think.

If you need this movie to understand how terrible the crimes visited on people by the fascists, Nazi and otherwise, during WWII were, then Pasolini's only success is that he has demonstrated just how sick and desensitized our global society has become.<br/><br/>Stark brutality has its value as a tool for demonstrating the full force of certain horrible events.  This tool was used effectively in other WWII films around the same subject, ""Schindler's List"" comes to mind.  The problem with this film is that this tool has to be accompanied by real emotion and demonstration of the effect of that brutality.  The only emotion (other than pure physical pain) demonstrated by the adolescents in this movie is during one scene where a young abductee cries at being reminded of the death of her mother.  Aside from that, the victims walk through this movie like zombies as various disgusting acts are perpetrated upon them.  There is no emotion, and frankly, the movie is an extremely boring series of repetitive acts of violence and humiliation that are reputedly designed to demonstrate the horror of unchecked power.  The truth is, this is a dull expose on the acts of several bored, wealthy, powerful members of society who can no longer find stimulation in the banal trappings of every day life, just like the book it is based on.  <br/><br/>The truth is, this movie has NOTHING to do with the horrors of fascism, it just happens that Pasolini chose a setting he knew well.  There is no reason that this same exact movie could not be shot in a palace in the Middle East, a castle in Austria, a Villa in Latin America or a mansion in the USA and be just as realistic.  It is nothing more than a dull comment on the depravity of the rich and bored.  <br/><br/>Don't be drawn in by the mystery and the hushed tones that people use when they speak of this so-called ""Masterpiece"".

","I strongly recommend this film to anyone over age 15. The main storyline is taken from De Sade and gives the story its elements of nihilism and sexual extravagance.<br/><br/>The setting in a rural villa outside the plagued Florence with prostitutes as storytelling muses is taken from Boccacio's Decameron, the first book written in Italian and not in Latin, thus beeing one of the indicators of the italian renaissance. The renaissance allowed the focus to somewhat move from God towards Man.<br/><br/>The film is furthermore divided into sections, called circles, which is a direct parallell to Dante's Divine Comedy. This may be the second most important book after the Bible and describes a journey from the Purgatory, through the deepest caves of the Inferno, that finally ends in Heaven.<br/><br/>This is the literary fond of the story: De Sades lust, Boccacios splendid, isolated, depraved bourgeoise and Dantes symbolic re-birth and claims for his loved one Beatrice. I would also add a biblical-galenical flirt with the four ""apocalyptic"" body fluids, even if Pasolini uses s*** instead of gall.<br/><br/>The Boccacio villa is moved to the late WW2 Salo republic in Italy, where Mussolini had his last stronghold. The orchestrators of the ritual orgys that are to take place is party of middle aged men (a metaphor for  the society?), deeply devoted to their mission to set up a blasphemic drama. The actors are kidnapped youths that are brought to the stage partly as decoration (objects) and partly to be actors in the play (subjects). However, as the individuals seek the transition from object to subject, they walk a thin line. The climax of the drama is the cleaning process (the punishment in the yard) where disobedience and breaking of rules must be paid for. Of course with lethal consequnces. In the play directed by the Libertins there are only black and white, and the only way to pay for your sins is with death. Of course the rules are totally inverted from the standards of society: Right is wrong.<br/><br/>Pasolini follows in his graphical expression the latin theater tradition, a direct communication with the audience. Pasolini wants to draw things to their ultimate end. Thats why he have to use the very strong ingredients that he does. Well, pehaps he could have made it less extreme but I believe that he did'nt want to compromise the least. Therefore this film deserves the uttermost respect.<br/><br/>See it, be disgusted if you must, but then ask yourself why you react like you do. If the sheer thought of the film fills you with repugnancy, then behold that your body contains both blood and s***, and realize that what is considered as insanities and atrocities today may be the norm of society tomorrow. Then ask yourself again why this is an important film and a milestone in the art of filmmaking."

"Dr_Coulardeau","10","30","51","27 January 2007"," The darker side of humanity is so easily brought in the limelight
","This film is Pier Paolo Pasolini's testament. It has not aged one iota and is even probably better now than it used to be. The first strong element is that it has to do with sex, the body and the use of the body for all kinds of sexual activities and pleasures. But onanism is out. Sex is always an activity that connects at least two people, more often than less a lot more than two if you include the voyeurs. The film is turning our voyeurism into a saturated mental ability though strangely enough the film remains extremely prudish as for actually showing the sexual intercourse and the torturing that is to come sooner or later. In fact when he wants for us to « see » the men with erections he keeps them trousered so that you can only see a form which is not an organ per se. Only one erection is really shown but because it is the slave who has an erection after having given anal sex to his master and torturer turned here into the dominated partner. This erection is not like in all other draped or wrapped up cases the evidence of the pleasure of some men in front of some humiliation imposed to other boys and girls, hence a sadistic though passive pleasure. In this case it is the domination of the master by the slave who could have strangled him in a couple of minutes and didn't because he does not need to rebel : he has already conquered real power over the master for conquering his backside. In other words Pasolini still plays a tremendous lot with our voyeurism by not showing the real thing, but still keeping the act itself covered up, dissimulated, hidden. Note this dimension of seeing the physical excitement of the young boys and girls strutting in front of us in the nude and quasi-nude on the screen is only possible with the boys for very organic reasons. But the second level of the film is the political fable or parable. Yes fascism is tremendously present in our consciousness and life. But probably not this kind of fascism which is to alienate a human being to the point when he has lost all existence in society and thus can become raw material with which you can play at leisure in three stages : passions, excrements and fatal suffering. Note the passions are those of the masters imposed onto the slaves who are shown as mostly moving along and even getting into the game with quite a lot of willingness. There are many slaves who are happy in the society that makes them slaves. Note the excrements can come from anywhere and it is a pleasure for the masters to eat them and to impose their being eaten to the slaves and here again, maybe in a more difficult way, some slaves take to it, clearly this time in some kind of resilient desire to survive if it requires such a drastic diet. It is true that a kiss of two male mouths that have both eaten some feces has some kind of a pungent taste and even attractiveness in its very kinkiness. Note fatal suffering, torturing someone to death is this time definitely one way : the masters are torturing some of the slaves and using the others to help them achieve their pleasure. This time you find out that some will be totally willing to take part in the torture of another one if it enables them to avoid the torture for themselves. This is definitely a heritage from the Shoah and how the Nazis had managed to make prisoners their ancillary servants in the very task of eliminating them all. It is by the way the only reason why there were some survivors. Among slaves there will always be some who will collaborate with the masters even in the torturing and killing of the others provided it protects them from the same fate, or at least pushes that fate slightly forward into the future. There Pasolini becomes prophetic. And when the film stops on two surviving fifteen year old boys dancing together on some American sounding music and exchanging the names of their girlfriends we have a sad gospel about the true nature of humanity. Domination, power, cruelty, brutality are one side of all human beings. This side will be dominant as soon as circumstances permit. Then the majority who will be deprived of this power will divide easily between those who will collaborate to survive a little bit longer and those who will not or will be chosen not to resist at all and will become the raw material of the desires of the powerful. So these boys and girls will not sound or look as what their age should make them sound and look. They will have been transformed in our consciousness into some kind of lurking monsters who are roaming in the back of each man's skull and definitely on the retinas of all our eyes. We are all ready to accept suffering if it means pleasure and we are all ready to inflict suffering and death to others because it will mean pleasure for us. Pasolini had a tremendously sombre vision of humanity and it is a good thing this film has come back to life after nearly thirty years of clandestinity.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

"EdgarST","10","21","35","4 May 2003"," Pasolini and ""Salò""
","I saw ""Salò"" for the first of more than 10 times in 1975, when I was 24 years old and lived in San Juan, Puerto Rico, one of the few places in the world where it was not banned upon its release. As I have often said, ""Salò"" is the movie that changed my relation with films, when I became conscious of one of cinema's most important characteristics, called ""impression of reality"", and learned how different film languages, with all their techniques, effects and punctuations, can manipulate people's emotions.<br/><br/>I believe that since Pier Paolo Pasolini wrote ""Teorema"" (the long poem), he was convinced that sex was the most effective weapon against bourgeoisie, as had been stated by people like Wilhelm Reich or indirectly by the Marquis de Sade, a bourgeois himself (please, correct me if I am wrong). ""Salò"" seemed to be his definite demonstration of such assumption, although I wonder how would have been his next film, ""Porno-Teo-Kolossal"", an erotic-theological super-spectacle he was preparing with playwright Eduardo de Filippo and actor Ninetto Davoli (notice a hint of the reverential in the frame's compositions of ""Salò"", which resemble religious tableaux.)<br/><br/>As a reaction to a consumerist society sunk in terrorism and political crisis as was Italy in the 1970s, Pasolini created this parable of power, using Brechtian techniques and taking full advantage of the depth of field, to shock audiences accostumed to as he said- ""cowboys and Indians and Sophia Loren"" (who reportedly left the movie house in revulsion). It's not easy to grasp in a single viewing all the connotations of a film that was attacked by both right and left, a movie about ideological perversion, genocidal sadism, pandering masochism and the transformation of human bodies into objects, a motion picture that addresses the fascist we all have inside, and that - after so much pessimism - gives us an image of ""hope"" (sort of) in the final scene in which a young guard teaches another one to dance!<br/><br/>Impressed by a film that had an essential bibliography in its credits, I was in awe in 1975. In any case, I wrote a positive review in a Puerto Rican newspaper, and after a couple of months it resurfaced and had a second run in an art house. In 1977 I returned to Panamá, where I wrote film reviews in a local paper and where ""Salò"" had not been yet released. In the summer of 1981 I led a group of Latin Americans in Paris to catch a show of ""Salò"" at 9pm, after missing it twice due to our confusion with nights that seemed to be afternoons, so bright at 8pm. This time I was surprised to discover Pasolini's humor amidst the horror he described. Back in Panamá, the manager of United Artists brought a copy from Santo Domingo and asked me to help him to get an exhibition certificate for ""Salò"", which he feared would also be banned in Panamá. With a couple of special screenings (I even had an argument with a priest who arrived late to a projection and stopped it to give a little speech against Pasolini, but who ended defending the filmmaker when the film was over!) and articles by other film critics, ""Salò"" was finally released in Panamá. Unfortunately, it played in a cinema specialized in pornography. At that time, I was the program director of the University of Panamá cinema and I rescued the film, which was exhibited for a month in the campus.<br/><br/>A couple of years ago I heard a wise final word about Pasolini's masterpiece, from a friend, filmmaker Orlando Senna. He said (more or less) that it would take a long time before ""Salò"" were ""assimilated by the mainstream"". Maybe it will happen, as abstract expressionism was seized by the cultural elites and official ideologies, and devoid of its subversive charge. But judging from the reactions it still causes in 2003, that time still seems to be far away."

"tsf-1962","10","19","32","2 December 2006"," a critique of master morality
","I did not hate this movie. ""Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom"" is probably the most widely excoriated movie of all time, but once you see it you realize that Piero Paolo Pasolini has fashioned a daring and disturbing vision of humanity's innate capacity for evil. I've never understood why so many writers and philosophers have made a cult of the Marquis de Sade. It's important to realize that Pasolini's take on the story is completely in opposition to Sade; instead of glorifying his aristocratic degenerates he portrays them as callous, hypocritical sycophants of fascism, whose atrocities are all too plausible in the context of the regime they serve. The notorious manure-eating scene, while hard to watch, was necessary to drive home the point of just how contemptible these monsters are. Much has been written about the disturbing passivity of the victims, but it's obvious the young men and women are terrified and with good reason. Rape is an act of violence, not sex, and the abuses perpetrated here have little to do with real eroticism; interestingly, any consensual sexual activity among the prisoners is punished with death. Although set in fascist Italy during World War II, the story could just as well be taking place in Bosnia, Rwanda, Cambodia . . . or Iraq for that matter. This film is a cautionary tale about what happens when people forfeit their humanity in service to a corrupt regime. As if to underscore his point Pasolini's characters frequently quote Nietzsche (the philosopher who did the most to spread Sade's gospel of evil throughout the world); during the final torture-execution scene we hear a radio broadcast of poetry by Ezra Pound, an American poet and willing accomplice in fascism. That Nietzsche and Pound still enjoy any legitimacy in academic circles shows how desperately we need this movie. The final torture-execution scene, though horrific, is filmed as seen from binoculars, which distants it and makes it somewhat more bearable. I don't think Pasolini was indulging in obscenity for its own sake; the violence, though brutal, is not notably more explicit than what goes on in most contemporary slasher films. Interestingly, though Pasolini was gay, this film does not portray male homosexuality in a positive light. There's something in ""Salo"" to disturb, engage, and enrage everyone, no matter their ideology. Perhaps that's a good thing."

","Nearly 30 years after its release, 'Salò' continues to enjoy, if that is the word I want, a reputation as a pinnacle of depravity, and thus draws to it both the blood-lusting 'Mondo Cane' crowd, simply interested in being shocked for its own sake, and fans of shock auteurs like Von Trier, Cronenberg, Greenaway et al., who like to look for beauty beneath grotesque surfaces. But both types of viewers will be disappointed to find that the most shocking thing about 'Salò' is how dull it is. Can this film really have raised eyebrows that much in the post-Warhol, post-Waters seventies? Today, its parade of filth and violence actually seems rather tame. You need to have the stomach for it, but it's hardly mind-blowingly horrible.<br/><br/>So, having dealt with 'Salò's' shock elements, I would now move on to its artistic qualities, only there really aren't any. Pasolini's technique is ham-fisted here, reminding one even more of Doris Wishman than of Warhol/Morrissey or Waters, and the content consists of a single thesis statement ('Fascism is bad'). Hardly an idea anybody would argue with, but not exactly profound either. Even as propaganda it's extremely weak--never elaborated in particularly imaginative or interesting or convincing ways. It's like one panel of a none-too-intelligent political cartoon stretched very thin over a two-hour period. Well, here's another rape . . . oh, look, some sh*t-eating . . . well, more torture.

When i saw it the impact was hard but not traumatic.<br/><br/>""Salò or the 120 days of Sodom"" can be seen by any person that wants to see it, this movie is not exclusive for intellectual people, but the person that wants to see it should investigate first about the fascism, of the life of Pasolini, of Sade and until the same Dante Alighieri. I think that if people don't take these steps first, the movie will be superficially view and it wont be seen by their meaning.<br/><br/>This criticizes by Pasolini toward the war it is a perfect metaphor of the fascism in Italy and at the same time a summarized chronicle of what this artist lived time behind. It is a work that many times, for alone to see the superficial thing and not the meaning, is not well interpreted.<br/><br/>""Salò or the 120 days of Sodom"" is not a movie to enjoy, it is a movie to make us think on that sometimes us, the people, should be it that supposedly are, human. And this movie express this perfectly, doesn't care in the time that is.<br/><br/>*Excuse me, for any error with the words"

","Why is it that bad artists always try to justify their garbage by claiming to be experimental, political, or any other aspect that does not pertain to the quality of the art? Well, simple- they cannot justify it any other way. Naturally, when the film or novel or painting's been banned in many places, it only allows the puerile artist to stroke himself more. But, since that's the only reason such art is made- witness all the art made from or with bodily excretions and/or simply used evoke outrage by lowest common denominator means, it means that the base reaction sought is easily achieved. Of course, astute art lovers and critics see through such crap with ease, while a few dilettantish asses do not; yet it's the asses who seem to always be quoted.<br/><br/>With that in mind, I recently watched Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1975 celluloid vomitus, Salò, or 120 Days Of Sodom (Salò O Le 120 Giornate Di Sodoma), and it is a horrid movie- not because of its sadomasochism and assorted other sexual ills, but because it is a poorly directed, anomically visual, horribly scripted, terribly acted, poorly scored mess of a film that lacks humor, depth, and any iota of quality. But, none of these are its worst sins- and the film that features every imaginable sexual perversion has been accused of many. No, the film's cardinal sin is not that it's disturbing, but that it is dull. I mean D.U.L.L. Overall, Salò, or 120 Days Of Sodom is a very bad film; not the worst film I've ever watched, but surely amongst the dullest- think of an Andy Warhol Factory Film with some pointless perversions tossed in. There is little artistic merit, technically, no real narrative nor character development, no deeper 'meaning,' so why watch it? The only possible reason would be so that a young filmmaker could see exactly what NOT to do. I will watch some of Pasolini's other films, but given my knowledge of this and his poetastry, I hold out little hope of getting by aesthetic socks knocked off.<br/><br/>Of course, one of the reasons the film's 'reputation'- such as it is, has endured, is because of the death of Pasolini shortly after the film's premiere. Depending on your mood, it was either ironic or fitting that Pasolini was murdered by a young man who was repulsed by the lech's overt homosexual advances and propositioning for money. There are several versions of the tale, online, but the most consistent details seem to be that the underaged youth, then recently released from jail, beat the crap out of the filmmaker, left him in the road, and then took Pasolini's keys to his car and repeatedly ran over the man with his own Alfa Romeo until he was dead. Naturally, and given the acrimony following the release of Salo, Pasolini defenders took to claiming that the Left Wing 'artist'- a convicted child molester, himself, could not have been killed by the kid, but was the target of- you got it, a government conspiracy to 'silence him.'<br/><br/>The film has also played to the exact stereotypes that defenders of Lowest Common Denominator Hollywood garbage point to as bad highbrow Eurotrash cinema, meaning, they claim, 'That their stuff is just as shitty as our stuff, but at least we admit it.' And the verity of this, in regards to Salò, is one of the reasons that so many people laugh at real art, when even the good stuff is drowned in pretension. But, when one posits this sort of garbage as art, its even more difficult to argue against the swill the Steven Spielbergs and Ron Howards release. Worse, is that, as stated, it's not even good porno (which often displays wit and bits of real eros), much less an interesting snuff nor exploitation film, merely a very, very pale imitation of Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, the film that Pasolini wanted this to be, but without having to exert the artistic effort a master like Kubrick did. The result is film that merely tries to elicit disgust in its audience, yet, years later, can barely manage a yawn. Pasolini's error, of course, was in thinking that the essence of art is an emotional thing, rather than an intellectual connection. After all, fart in a church, and take a look at the looks you get- mere 'reaction' is not that difficult a thing to accomplish.<br/><br/>Perhaps the only real positive I could say about the film- or rather the Eurocult DVD (which lacks any real bonus features- not even a trailer), is that it does come with golden subtitles. Unfortunately, even that very minor positive is abated by the fact that the subtitles contain numerous grammatical and spelling errors. Overall, this film is not worth spending a dime nor a minute on. Take a pass on this film and rent an old porno film- perhaps a classic from the Ron Jeremy library. Ah, emotion!"

","If you've come this far to find Salo in the pits of IMDb then you are probably pretty determined to see this film.

Of this I have no doubt and non can exist.

The argument being that if you did watch it you must indeed be sick yourself.<br/><br/>You can take these arguments for as much as you want. Some people love this film, others hate it, myself I cannot say I am in either category. I certainly do not like the movie, but my feelings on it are not hatred. The movie simply is the epitome of lacking anything of value. For me any message that the artist was trying to get across was lost in the attempt to make a vile movie. I simply cannot think of one redeeming factor from the movie that would make it of value, simply nothing. Whatever vision Pasolini had he lost it amongst the rage that was obviously tearing him up inside.

"StevePulaski","8","7","10","27 July 2012"," ""A disturbing masterpiece""
","Pier Paolo Pasolini's Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom is among the sickest and most depraved films I have yet to see. It is also among one of the most intellectual and artistic. For a film seemingly constructed on elements that are artless and unforgivable, the man himself has created a feisty political allegory, capable of self expression, impressionism, and heavy interpretation. Things I would've never expected from a film that has been banned and outlawed in several different countries.<br/><br/>When compared to recent torture porn films, or even those that date back several years or decades ago like Cannibal Holocaust or the distasteful and horrendous August Underground, it is shocking to stumble upon a film that features sodomy, sexual humiliation, torture, manipulation, cruelty, depravity, fascism, totalitarianism, graphic rape, homosexuality, and voyeurism all in the same film. Let alone a film that gets a recommendation by me. This is a recommendation like no other I have given. I'm recommending this to the willing, the brave, and the cinephiles. The ones who won't immediately attack it as a piece of Italian shock cinema or depravity without a purpose, but those who are prepared to judge it as a piece of commentary and cinematic art. Bringing this up in a casual conversation like you would do a majority of films, and you may have lost yourself a friend.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the Republic of Salò in Italy, circa 1944, right after the fall of the Mussolini government, where four corrupt libertines kidnap nine boys and nine girls and subject them to four months of extreme sexual acts, acts of torture, sodomy, and ones that will test their physical and mental health. They are taken to a place in Marzabotto, where they spend their days in a luxurious palace, either committing several hateful acts or listening to descriptive stories about prostitute's sexual encounters.<br/><br/>The film is divided into four different ""circles,"" which are taken from the book The 120 Days of Sodom, by the Marquis de Sade. While the film features a plethora of nudity, it is anything but erotic. Instead it is cold, numbing, and aggressively unpleasant. We watch as unspeakable acts such as coprophagia occur and we, as audience members, can not help but question the fascist's motivations.<br/><br/>But that is just it; there are none. Like many films about a brutally corrupt and dictative government, Battle Royale instantaneously comes to mind, there are no justifications. There are, however, a number of things that are symbolic about the world around us that we can either choose to explore and question or ignore and bury deep in our heads. The corrupt fascists obviously represent dictators of the time, such as Hitler, Mussolini, and Stalin, while the young adolescents forced to partake in these soul-crushing events represent the victims of the Holocaust. The soldiers who are constantly guarding the teenagers and assuring they don't escape could possibly be the loyal followers of the dictators that go along with the pack leader, despite personal feeling and or opinions.<br/><br/>And then there you are - the viewer - the person who is acting as a voyeur during the events of the film. Pasolini knows exactly how he wants his audience to feel and that is guilty, unsettled, frightened, terrified, vulnerable, and most of all, voyeuristic. He blatantly calls you out for it at the end of the picture, where you become one with the corruption, laughing numbingly at the events taking place behind stone walls.<br/><br/>The film looks like someone along the lines of Wes Anderson or Haskell Wexler picked up a camera and filmed the most provocative and inhuman shots this side of the earth. Aesthetically speaking, Salò is an intricately made picture, delicately crafted and maturely handled, with painstaking detail in every shot and elegance in every frame, even when acts of the complete opposite nature are occurring. With the use of some stellar piano music as well, this is a film that boasts all the features of a vivacious melodrama, but has all the characteristics of a seriously haunting snuff film.<br/><br/>It is apparent that people will have different reactions to the film. Some will feel visually manipulated and appalled. Some will be stained and irreversibly shaken. Some will shut it off halfway through. Others will brave through the excursion and then question why they did. But some will see the brave qualities and ambition it took to make such a film, one that toys with the audience and then boldly criticizes them afterwards. It is noted that Pasolini, one of the many directors I need to explore, became severely depressed before venturing into this territory of filmmaking, and saw all of his films as worthless and overly-compromised, and would make a film focusing on things of an explicit nature, before being brutally murdered. I conclude with the statement that if you're optimistic and curious enough, Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom is a film to see. Just prepare yourself with the proper mindset that this is a film that should be known for its graphic detailing of political commentary and allegories and not one of its inadvertently subversive and inhuman material.<br/><br/>Starring: Paolo Bonacelli, Giorgio Cataldi, Umberto Paolo, Quintavalle, Aldo Valletti, and Caterina Boratto. Directed by: Pier Paolo Pasolini."

"Galina_movie_fan","8","8","12","14 November 2008"," Absolute Darkness
","""Salo or 120 Days of Sodom"" (1975) by Pier Paolo Pasolini is the film that completely lives up to its reputation of one of or even THE most disturbing, depressing, cruel, and unwatchable ever made. I had to fast forward some of the scenes and turned from the screen during the others. It is not surprising because Pasolini had adapted to the screen the most notorious and IMO unreadable novel by Marquise De Sade and updated it from 18th Century France to 1944 Fascist's Italy to so called Republic of Salo where Mussolini had his last residence. I could not finish the novel. I stopped after 40 pages or so because it is not the novel really rather a catalog of disgusting. The main four characters have been introduced in the beginning as the fully developed monsters. Their victims just stayed that - the victims. There is no plot, no intrigue, and no development, just the endless loop of rapes, tortures, and murders. Yes, I understand that it is a satire and the absolute power corrupts absolutely but reading the book was a torture of boredom. As for Pasolini's work, I've loved and admired every one of his films I've seen before I decided to see Salo. Controversial, unpredictable, a true poet of cinema, his films are among my favorites, they talk to me like not many do. I finished watching ""Salo or 120 Days of Sodom"", all of it, including the tragic devastating final part, and I have not formed the final opinion on it. It is not the film to enjoy, it is a beautifully photographed by great Tonino Delli Colli, dressed by Danilo Donati, with Production design by Dante Ferretti, set on piano music by Frédéric Chopin, ""Carmina Burana"" by Carl Orf, and original score by Ennio Morricone, journey to hell, to its most horrifying circles, and there is no Virgil to guide us there. Is it a masterpiece as some of the critics and viewers suggest or the failure that forgot what it wanted to say by showing the scene after scene of unthinkable tortures, humiliations and degradations that so called humans (or the creatures that look like humans but are worse than animals because animals don't torture for pleasure) inflict on the helpless and innocent victims? I don't know but it is unforgettable whether you like it or not and it was made by a brilliant master of cinema.<br/><br/>It is truly one of its kind films, and sometimes I think it is great, but more often - why Pasolini made it? As far as violence and disgusting content go, there are hundreds of films that have outdone Salo by the mile but nothing can beat it by its emotional impact, nothing can compare in the exploration of depths of inhumanity so called humans who are in reality the monsters in human shape are capable of. Pasolini said he wanted to make a movie with no hope - Salo it is. There is no hope, no single ray of light, no hint of optimism, only absolute darkness, and that perhaps disturbs and depresses the viewers so much. I still hear the cry of one of the girls-victims in the end of the film, ""Why did God abandon us?!!"" In the world where God turned his face away from His creatures, horror and degradation of these proportions are possible, and they may and do repeat over and over again in different periods of time, in different countries and continents.<br/><br/>Pasolini's last film is not the one I will ever want to see again but I believe it should be seen at least once by any thinking viewer."

","Northern Italy in the mid-1940's. Several wicked and decadent fascist libertine bureaucrats round up nine teenage boys and girls in a remote villa. The innocent adolescents are subjected to 120 days worth of mental, sexual, and physical torture.<br/><br/>Director/co-writer Pier Paola Pasolini and co-writer Sergio Citti use the harsh, yet gripping premise as a means to fiercely critique the gross abuse of power and authority (the rich elite villains are a truly hateful and sadistic lot), the intrinsic foulness of fascism, the corrupting influence of evil and amorality, and the extreme lengths people will resort to in the name of the survival (some of the kids rat out their fellow prisoners under the belief that it will better their chances of living through their grueling ordeal). Moreover, Pasolini presents all the sex and nudity in a highly clinical and detached manner, thus depriving said potentially erotic content of any arousing aspects and instead depicting the horrific pain, suffering, and degradation that the kids are subjected to in an unnervingly stark and unflinching way. Indeed, the pervasive atmosphere of uncompromisingly bleakness, nihilism, and depravity proves to be much more startling and disturbing than any of the atrocities committed throughout. Tonino Delli Colli's lush painterly cinematography, the soundtrack of elegant classical music, and the beautiful sets and costumes provide a jarring contrast to the appalling cruelty the adults display to their hapless cowering victims. Gut-churning and emotionally draining for sure, but recommended viewing for those with the stomach and stamina to handle it."

","Pasolini is difficult for many to approach for the simple reason that so many of his defenders feel called upon to ""explain"" his films. It is true that a great work of art is inexhaustible and that many of us would benefit from added information about it; in the case of Pasolini, however, the ""explanations"" are considerably more interesting than the work itself, and this is particularly true of SALO, a film of notorious reputation.<br/><br/>With SALO, Pasolini very freely adapts de Sade into a tale of young innocents kidnapped for use as sexual toys by the 'powerful but depraved' during World War II. In theory, the film is a ""metaphor"" for the ""German rape of Italy."" In practice, it emerges as so much directorial self-importance and self-indulgence, badly structured in a highly obvious triptych style, badly scripted, badly performed, and badly filmed.<br/><br/>It is also an incredibly slow film enlivened by the depiction of sexual abuse and torture, none of it greatly believable but all of it fairly distasteful. Those expecting an erotic tone will be disappointed; even so, certain images will linger in mind long after the film ends. The catch: the images that linger do so by reason of their extremely unpleasant nature.<br/><br/>Pasolini was murdered not long after he made SALO and to this day rumors of a conspiracy abound. For myself, I strongly suspect that he was put out of his misery by movie-goers weary of his constant efforts to pass off his utter incompetence as a stylistic device.<br/><br/>Gary F.

","Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salò"" has been commented perhaps more than any other movie has. Yet, what is missing in all the commentaries I have read so far is the fact that this film was written and directed by a man who was in first line the founder of film semiotics and a professor of philosophy. Therefore, ""Salò"" cannot be watched without sufficient knowledge of the science of the signs and its metaphysics. This, of course, turns this movie into a piece of art before an extremely high theoretical background. Hence, it is not a movie for everybody. Pasolini even went so far as to quote  like in scientific works  the sources that he used for his last movie: most of all Philippe Sollers' ""Numbers"" and Roland Barthes' semiotic writings.<br/><br/>According to semiotics, a sign represents reality, while reality presents itself. But since we cannot perceive reality without signs, we live in a semiotic world. A sign and its designated object, however, are always separated by a con-textural border: Signs never reach reality, but reality, on the other side, survives only in the signs that we perceive. Signs, therefore, dilute reality, and, as a result of this dissolution of reality, they become ambiguous. Or, to put it from the other side: it is only because of their ambiguity that signs preserve reality. The abyss between a sign and its eternally unreachable object is the very source of creativity. Even a photograph  an icon in the terminology of Charles Sanders Peirce  and thus the sign that is closest to its represented object  will never turn into this object, as, vice versa, the object itself can never be exchanged by its photograph, but photography would not be considered as art if there would not be creativity involved.<br/><br/>And this is exactly what Pasolini demonstrates in his final movie: This allegedly cruel and gruel icons represent a reality by scooping out like in no other movie the creative potential in the con-textural abyss between signs and their objects. Watching the ""Salò"", therefore, means watching behind the signs that we see in the movie. Pasolini leads us directly into this creative abyss, he creates a world out of this never-land, out of the nothing about which the German-American philosopher Gotthard Günther wrote that there is a world ""that God has not yet created"". It is, therefore, a world that has to be created by man, and this exactly involves all the cruelty that only mankind ever achieved: the torturing scenes, the eating of feces, the rapes, the executions. It is not by chance, either, that Pasolini divided ""Salò"" into four circles: Here Sollers' non-Aristotelian number theory, Derrida's also non-Aristotelian work, Barthes' semiotics and Pasolini's ""Heretical Empricism"" meet one another. For people without this background, ""Salò"" appears as a museum of random historical absurdity, merging the Marquis De Sade's stories and the fascist practices of Mussolini that accompanied the film director's whole life.<br/><br/>""Salò"" urges the audience to watch behind the pictures, thus behind the signs. After all, this is exactly what metaphysics is about: behind the reality, here: behind the artistic and fragile reality of the signs: The signs could be exchanged by other signs, since their ambiguity create a theoretically infinite number of artistic worlds, and it was Nietzsche who said that metaphysics is acceptable only as an artistic one.<br/><br/>This terrifyingly brilliant masterpiece I rate with 10 points."

A group of libertines, about to be smashed by the Alliance at the end of WWII, do what animals backed in a corner would do best. They kidnap the most vulnerable of the populace, teenagers, and brutally rape and degrade them, finally murdering them. That's basically it for the story, but this film isn't really about story, at least for me. The film to me is a reflection on any government. The children are us, the citizens, and the libertines are forces in power. ***Viewer Beware*** This film could be the kind of experience that you'd wish you'd never had, so individual discretion is advised. The film has some pretty nauseating things in it. For me the ""turd"" banquet was the hardest to watch, but at the same time was the most rewarding message-wise.The government will feed us @#@! and we are expected to eat it and cherish the experience. Pier Paolo Pasolini was the director of the film, and he was murdered days before the film was to be released. Some say Salo was the reason, but I don't know about that. I do know that although I consider it a revolution in cinema, I personally never want to see this film ever again. A no-longer-friend of mine saw this and laughed at it. Positively nothing is funny here. Pasolini had it right when he said that this film is about the opposite of love...the absence of it."
"mbeagh","10","5","7","21 November 2016"," Perverse and Fascinating
","More than 40 years after its initial release, Salo is still shocking, perverse, fascinating, and darkly funny. Four libertines, powerful fascists in Nazi-controlled Italy, kidnap 18 teenagers and bring them to a hidden palace. There they subject them to torture and sexual abuse. They completely dehumanize their victims, showing them no sympathy and punishing them when they plea for sympathy. The teenagers must play the role of sex toys with no feelings. The libertines enjoy them in perverse, degrading ways, but exquisitely, as an epicurean would enjoy a fine wine. They judge the teenagers like they would prize cattle, appreciating their beauty, but slaughtering them when done with them. All the while they casually discuss the nature of pleasure, power, and life, quoting Nietzsche and other philosophers. The libertines are detached from their victims, as the viewer is detached from both victim and torturer. Pasolini shows in Salo how the powerful dehumanize the powerless. It is graphically sexual and violent without being either a porn or horror flick. The cold detachment, the intelligence, and the strength of the message prevent it from being either. Salo is not for everyone, but for film lovers who can stomach it, it's a must-see."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","5","7","7 May 2012"," Uncomfortable
","So where do I even begin on one of the most controversial movies of all time? I guess that's why I felt that I had to see Salo, I was very curious. I like to challenge myself when it comes to film and test my limits. When I watched the film Cannibal Holocaust, as disturbing as it was, it had a meaning to it that I really admired. Salo is looked at either as the worst film that you could possibly see or a masterpiece. Before watching the film I read a couple of Pier Paolo Pasolini's poems online, as he is praised for his writing and I have to say that I was in awe. What a soul this man had and I couldn't wait to see Salo. Well, if there was a film ever to test my limits on what I could handle, Salo sure did a good job of testing my gag reflex.<br/><br/>Four men of power, the Duke, the Bishop, the Magistrate, and the President agree to marry each other's daughters as the first step in a debauched ritual. With the aid of several collaborating young men, they kidnap 9 young men and 9 women, and take them to a palace. Accompanying them are four middle-aged prostitutes, whose function in the debauchery will be to recount erotically arousing stories for the men of power, who, in turn, will sadistically exploit their victims. The story depicts some of the many days at the palace, during which the four men of power devise increasingly abhorrent tortures and humiliations for their own pleasure. In 120 days, the children experience sheer horror and never ending torture that you would never wish upon anyone.<br/><br/>So the question is: is this garbage or a masterpiece? I'm honestly not sure, the way the film is shot is just perfect. It really has this cold feeling to it and almost empty. The acting is also pretty good and your heart is in agony for these children as they are pit against these sadists. They are put through every kind of torture that you can imagine and never wish upon your worst enemy. They are forced into sexual acts, to eat human feces(which looks too real that you will be disturbed), get beaten, and don't know what will happen the next day if they will be let go or be put to execution. You could never imagine or at least want to imagine what they are going through and the terror they must have felt every day.<br/><br/>The bad about this film is that maybe it does go too far. I am all for freedom of speech and I totally get why the director wanted to show it, we wouldn't have as much sympathy for the teens. However, it makes you wonder how far he would go for the sake of art. No one ever said that art was safe, but this was really pushing on what your eyes could handle. Also the scenes where the prostitutes were talking about their childhood experiences all going into detail of every sexual moment did drag on quite a bit and while the subject was risky, the whole film plays up that you're waiting for the bad to happen. So there are times where it does feel a bit slow paced. Wither to recommend this film to you is a hard oneI know that I'm going to have a hard tie if I ever watch it again, it's all in the eye of the beholder. But be warned, I can handle a lot of movies, this one definitely did get to me.<br/><br/>6/10"
"rbverhoef","6","7","11","25 November 2006"," Interesting, but also slightly disappointing
","What director Pier Paolo Pasolini does with 'Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom' is making a point a lot of people already understand. Those who do not will probably not get this film either. In the most simple way you can say that the film shows us what happens when an unchecked regime has all power. Pasolini uses the fascists and places the events near the end of WW-II. Sex and violence and the desire to power are very much connected, Pasolini thinks and shows.<br/><br/>The story itself exists out of nine boys and nine girls being physically and mentally tortured, most of the time sexually. This is done by four Libertines and the people who support them; well dressed people with the sickest of ideas. Although I thought the scenes were either disgusting or disturbing the film itself is not that unwatchable. Not that it is for everyone though. The stories told in the film are more disturbing than most of the things shown, and the only really disgusting scene deals with excrement and eating.<br/><br/>What Pasolini does, one thing I particularly admired, is show human nature in the most evil way. And I am not just talking about the fascists here. To survive we do about anything, and some sequences of betrayal show how merciless people can be, maybe even more so in conditions like these. These sequences also show that even though it seems there is no future, there is always time and especially need for sex. In this case ""normal"" sex, without any humiliation or torture.<br/><br/>The admiration for this piece of work is overshadowed by some aspects. Again, it makes a good point, but with the horrors of the Nazi's and Italian fascists in our memory we don't really need a film like this to show that again. The interesting parts are in the details, like I described above. I was fascinated, a little disgusted, and in the end slightly disappointed. That said I am very glad I have seen it, probably without seeing it ever again. I would recommend to try that as well."

","Pointless peace of garbage! Criticism of fascism? No, this is not that, just a sick fantasies of a sick mind, with no point or message at all! Only purposeless disgusting scenes which were filmed just to be disgust, there's nothing ""deep"" and ""artistic"" one can found here! The strongest feeling I had after watching this garbage was - the censorship is a great invention of the mankind! I greet all those countries that banned this ""movie"", it should be treated the way the satanist and pedophilia products are, and the people who sell/buy this, should be prosecuted.

"sol-","Null","2","2","10 December 2015"," Hedonism always comes at a cost
","""The limit of love is always needing an accomplice"" claims one of the four self-proclaimed fascists in this film who kidnap several teenagers to use for their sexual gratification in war-torn Italy. Much has been written about 'Salò' being an allegory for fascism, and the extremes to which the four men take their subjects are shocking even upon revision. What some miss though is that this is equally a film about the four men themselves - four unhappy and once repressed individuals letting their sexual fantasies come to life and living in a hedonistic manner, though not without a cost. The cost is the need for an ""accomplice"", and as the camera relishes in the horrified reactions of the victims (rather than their torture; this is NOT an exploitation film), the central dynamic soon becomes suffering for another's joy. The fascists never really want to harm or hurt their subjects; they enjoy cuddling and kissing them, but the gratification that they seek does not provide the same satisfaction to the teenagers. 'Salò' a confronting film and one that is hard to turn away from, with the only misstep being the abrupt ending (apparently Pasolini shot four endings as he was that unsure of how to bring things to a close). The casting is pretty much spot-on. Aldo Valletti as the cross-eyed 'President' and Paolo Bonacelli as the eloquent 'Duke' are especially well cast. Both are so formidable, but also noticeably human beneath it all with their burning desires for gratification. Fascism might be evil, but the fascists here curiously just flawed human beings, drowning in uncontrolled excesses."

","I couldn't watch this movie in one sitting. I tried and made it about half an hour into it and couldn't bare to watch it anymore. I did watch it all but over the course of a couple weeks. I would resume watching it from where I left off and then about half an hour later turn it off again. That being said this movie is unforgettable and truly a powerful film. The emotions it evokes are all negative. There is not a shred of hope or happiness in the whole thing. This film is a work of art it speaks loudly of the depravity of man and the horrors people are capable of putting others through. It's an admirable work of art, but it is the most unpleasant thing I've ever watched."
"edgar-glez","10","11","20","30 September 2007"," An artist's view on human condition
","This, along Last Year at Marienbad, has been the most difficult (and sought after) DVDs for me to get. But, when it finally got to my hands (as a part of a 5-disc Pasolini pack my brother sent me from Europe), I didn't know what to do with it. It sat on my coffee table for some three days until I finally decided to watch it, alone, by myself, on a quiet mid summer's night.<br/><br/>Pier Paolo Pasolini (PPP) is one commanding director, a one who speaks to yourself on a very direct (in-your-face), profound way. For me, his movies are slow, dense, profound but, most of all, intriguing. The first PPP movie I ever saw was Oedipus Re, and it was just beautiful. Then my PPP journey began, next came Il Vangelo Secondo Mateo, Teorema, Porcile, The Canterbury Tales, 1001 Nights... and, Salò.<br/><br/>I was really afraid of watching this movie because of all I've previously read about it. But I've learned to love disgusting, violent and provocative movies, such as Irreversible, Ichi the Killer, Baise Moi, Fat Girl, Dans ma Peu... so I decided to give it a try, with an empty stomach.<br/><br/>There's no much else for me to tell you about the movie that no one else has written before. Unless that I liked it. It truly is repulsive, but that is the main point of PPP, for you, as a viewer to get his vision (and repulsion) on acts done to humans by humans.<br/><br/>""The degradation of man by man"" said Bertrand Bonello (a French director) when interviewed on this movie. That is the most terrifying thesis of the film.<br/><br/>This movie caused on me a lot of reactions. Should I suffer because of all of the tortures infringed on those poor girls and boys? Should I be angry at those authorities? Should I be horrified by the killings? Sure... but, what was most disgusting to me was the fact that the stories who set the pace of the movie (and the punishments) were told by these mature women, those who normally bring moral and good education to houses and schools, in here they bring depravity and sick stories for the listeners just to get sexual excitation. It's the most direct link to the Marquis de Sade. And just as Sade was, these four main listeners are supposed to be well educated, powerful and wealthy individuals that have impact on their society and are in Salò just for their amusement. And they do all of these depraving acts just for boredom.<br/><br/>I could go on for hours with these thoughts but, my main point is this: artists are known for pushing the envelope, they defy all of the establishment in moral, sexual and religious subjects. Artists help to change the face of society, but are not always well accepted or understood. Just think of Picasso's ""Guernica"" and all of Goya's images of killings, or Michaelangelo painting a nude man (same stature as God Himself) right in the middle of Pope's personal Sistinne Chappel. They defied their time and their establishment. PPP did a wonderful job in this department, as he manages to transform a story on Fascism into a story of true horror.<br/><br/>A work of art has to have artistic value, it can have aesthetic value as well, but not necessarily. Salò has without a doubt a great artistic value, but not (for some) an aesthetic one.<br/><br/>Is cinema the art of the 20th century? Yes. Are movies about WWII the most profound, compelling ones? Yes. Then, Salò has to be the greatest film on history.<br/><br/>Watch the movie if you truly want to, sure it's shocking, but every great work of art is as well.<br/><br/>Ed."
"vishvakarman","10","17","34","6 February 2007"," The most important film of all time
","Just how important the message of this film and the intellectual discussion of de Sade's Nihilism in general really is was shown to us not long ago in the case of the tortures in the Iraqi POW prison of Abu Ghureib. The culprits are none other than the devils shown to us in Pasolini's play. And this is the sad message, of which we constantly need to be reminded: Humans, if given the power and chance of going unpunished, are worse than animals. Animals kill for prey and self-protection, but humans differ from animals in that they kill, torture and humiliate others for sheer pleasure of power. They are devils, not animals. When watching Salo, I felt exactly the same shock and outrage I felt when I saw the pictures from the Iraqi prison.<br/><br/>Hopefully, reminders of this potential for human fiendishness will in future come to us more in form of great movies such as Salo, rather than sad and outraging actual events, such as in Abu Gureib."

","Of all the movies I've seen, and I've seen a lot, Salò is by far the most disturbing, disgusting, and utterly powerful film. Each scene is a massive orgy, and as the scenes progress the orgies get more intense. But only the sickest of individuals would find these scenes exciting and erotic. A sick feeling grows in the pit your stomach as the movie progresses and you get the urge to turn off the movie every second of it, but it's so disturbingly fascinating that you cannot look turn it off. The really frightening part is that although the exact story is fiction, it is based on some hints of truth. At the end of Fascist rule in Italy (1945, when the movie is set) such things did happen. Pasolini certainly revealed a dark side of human nature in this horrifying film, and he definitely accomplished his goal of making an ""unconsumable film"". Watching this movie once seems like more than enough, and yet not watching it at all seems like a shame."

","Salò is,just as the making of it was, a sad, if spectacular, waste of energy. Notionally a metaphor for Fascism (it is set in Italy in 1944), and specifically about the connection between politics, violence, and sexual excitement, ""Salò"" has in fact no meaningful link to Fascism whatsoever, but is simply a display of twisted lust, spun by the fantasies of four extreme perverts, not to mention the director himself. Clearly Pasolini (who could either be exceptionally inspired or - as here - absolutely dire) had hit the creative buffers, and so - in his tale of four power-mad, sexually-warped members of the ruling elite - seems to relish serving up endless examples of the most gruesome conduct.<br/><br/>A movie stuffed with brutal demonstrations of power and perversion of every kind but.......got noticed."

","It's nothing more just a sadistic illusion of perverted society. You can dig deep and try to find some meanings to this, but you could do this in any movie, if you must seek some hidden meanings every second of it – it's just a sign of bad story-telling. This movie doesn't really have a plot. It has somewhat beginning, but hardly if any development, nothing's explained, ending is just a random mess too. I guess the purpose of it was to shock me, but I wasn't shocked – it was sick, gross and disturbing, but not shocking, mostly because it's one dimensional at most parts and includes the personal culmination of perversion and madness of director and writers. Why all of those men gay? Did they need to take girls at all in that case? It's pretty hard to find group of men who would enjoy every kind of perversion like sh*t eating and group orgies, while trying to find some ""deep"" meaning in it. And all those men from stories seem like that too. I mean – yes, there exists some of this kind, but so many in one place - come-on. It's like movie is trying to say, that everyone can become like that if someone will push the right buttons. God no. It is possible for such society to exist, but it will never happen and it never even came close to that in the history of humanity and while jumping to disagree with me just remember, that the creators just made it up to be this way, they dug up into the deepest horrors of their minds and what came up was Salo. It may be one-in-a-life-time experience for some, because of a gross content, but for the most part this movie is just pointless. I don't buy it."

Pasolini's portrayed beliefs of a corrupted society on screen with every putrid detail. His graphic images too much to bear for viewers and took away from the point he was trying to make. If Pasolini made this film less repulsive, one might be able to actually to receive the message he's trying to make.

Can't remember what, but it was always in the back of my mind as a title I needed to see as a movie fan. But it's worthless. I watched it, sat all the way through it, and I have no idea what for.<br/><br/>I can't imagine why someone would want to make this film. I see no message in it. It isn't atmospheric, or pretty to look at, there isn't any decent acting and most of the time you're just watching some overly painted face tell a disgusting story. The torture scenes, if you actually put them together would amount to about 15 minutes of the film, the rest of it is these inane stories and you waiting for something to happen. Half of the ""torture"" happens at a distance so you can't really see what's going on anyway and the other half is people eating something they shouldn't be eating and it just makes you wonder why someone would want audiences to sit there and watch that. That's the real torture. The director was the real sadist.<br/><br/>I mean take the worst horror movie you've seen and the plot has got to be better than this film. Most horror movies even the bad ones have some message or moral to the story. This one is just trying to convince you that Nazis are the most disgusting people ever by showing you disgusting acts, or better yet the same disgusting act over and over. I mean I really just got aggravated because I had heard about this for so long but it was a complete waste of my time. The only people who would praise it are the type who want to seem sophisticated so they pretend to like everything as if they ""get"" some kind of ""art"" that only the best and the brightest can understand.

Passolini has captured an aspect of humanity that is grotesque and horrifying with this film. I saw this for the first time four weeks ago, and I am still haunted by it every day. EVERY DAY. Honestly, I don't think I'll ever be the same person again after viewing this work. There is no way any person, author, film-maker, or artist can address the subject matter of 'fascism' and the boundless cruelty humans are capable of without mirroring that ugliness themselves. This film is a masterwork. It's traumatic and that's why it matters. It will never become irrelevant. This is a film everyone should see. And hopefully our eyes will open to the fact that barbarism in every aspect is still happening around us every day, every minute, everywhere - dressed in a designer gown and tiara."

","OK, so I've just finished watching the uncut version of this film at my fraternity. A few people asked to watch it with me when I mentioned that some believe it to be the most disturbing film in the world. It ended up being about eight of us watching it, like it was some sort of brotherhood event. Five of us stuck through it to the ending. This movie is disturbing and equally disturbed. None of us knew exactly what to say about it when it was finished. One friend mentioned that sitting through this movie was literally as he imagined what it must be like sitting in hell. ""We've just been to hell and back,"" he said. Most of the group felt that the film was utterly without purpose. I could see Pasolini's intent in Salo, however, and I believe that the film truly has merit. I cannot recommend the movie, but I can highly commend it for accomplishing what it sets out to accomplish. For those who are looking to view the film as sheer exploitation, don't. It isn't worth your time if you can't appreciate the dialog and the message behind the madness. In the minds of the Duke, the Bishop, and the President, pure liberty come in the form of complete willfulness. If you can understand this concept, then maybe you are ready to tackle Salo. If not, just give your cravings for exploitation a rest: this isn't meant to be viewed in such a way.

"DarthVoorhees","9","5","8","22 July 2011"," 'Salo', an exercise in depravity and the art of filmmaking
","'Salo' is a really rough movie to sit through and ultimately to review. The film is an unapologetic exercise in playing with themes of sadomasochism and the depths of cruelty human beings are capable of. Not once does the film flinch in it's exploration and portrayal of sadism on the screen. It is perhaps this matter of fact quality that makes 'Salo' all the more memorable and frightening a film. I personally don't flinch easily and often I was tempted to look away in this film. What accents everything and makes this film even more disturbing is that it isn't really a character or narrative driven film. It just goes through many acts of depravity like they are simply human functions we take for granted. The audience wants a victim to identify with and there isn't one. The torturers are given much more depth than their victims, who aren't at all fleshed out to the point where they just are there. The effect is that they almost appear as objects and I am sure that is what Pier Pasolini was going for and it is a powerful way to explore this material. We look at these victims simply as base human beings who cruelty is inflicted upon again and again.<br/><br/>What is perhaps most interesting about the film for me is what sex represents as a metaphor here. I think it is interesting that Pasolini has moved the setting to Fascist Italy. I love the fact that these fascist libertines have a definition of sex defined by their society to the point where their sexual urges and fantasies become violent. The unfortunate young prisoners all are frightened to death by their sexuality largely due to the social views of Mussolini's Italy and thus these captors use their society to torture their young for their pleasure. The idea of who controls the discovery of sex is brought up in the film when the Duke character reacts violently to a young woman's cries over her mother. 'Salo' is a nightmare portraying a world where Sex is controlled and open and loses all of it's sensuality and spirituality. This might be perhaps the most important lesson to take from the film.<br/><br/>What is one to make of 'Salo'? It's a hard sell obviously but it's a powerful and well made film. It's often visually beautiful and the four fascist torturers are well performed. So I recommend it on it's filmmaking merits. It's staying power can be measured in that Pasolini's vision doesn't soon leave you and you are forced to comprehend the film you just watched.I imagine a great many people consider it nothing more than porn and I can say that their argument has weight but 'Salo' is so artistically done and blunt in it's subject matter that it has a power some films will never have."

","This film begins with four men of power, the Duke, the Bishop, the Magistrate, and the President, agreeing to marry each other's daughters as the initiation of a depraved ceremony. With the help of various young collaborators, they capture nine young boys and nine young girls, and take them to a château near a small town, the site of a WWII civilian massacre. Shadowing them are four middle-aged prostitutes, collaborators as well, whose activity in the depravity will be to depict aphrodisiac tales for the men of power, and who, in turn, will viciously abuse their young victims.<br/><br/>His Excellency, the Duke, says, ""It's seeing those who don't enjoy what I do, and who suffer the worst, that provides the fascination of telling myself I'm happier than that scum they call the people."" And every unpleasant fraction is embraced and extended. The camera remains on the blood dribbling from the victims' mouths when strong-armed to ingest food filled with nails, and on the stool cover their lips when forced to eat feces, which their captors gladly eat.<br/><br/>I don't think I have ever seen such relentlessly stomach-turning content, let alone comparable content done with such poise and sophistication. There is such rich, vibrant color, it is set in a tremendous palace, and we are affronted by the calming white of the chapter headings. The film takes place during the WWII occupations, but we forget all about that until one arbitrary moment when a plane, ostensibly a fighter jet, flies above the storyteller's window. She observes briefly, then it's out of her head again. The actors don't play at all like they are in a tragedy. They all seem so indifferent. The film feels designed to show not the joy of sexual perversions but, instead, the objectification and exteriorization of the body in the unnatural social macrocosm imposed by neocapitalism.<br/><br/>Pasolini's libertines are neither de Sade's blue-bloods nor a Romantic-era novelist's diabolical protagonists who confront their culture but calculating, monstrous government officials who are driven by resentment and ineffectuality rather than lust. As for their nude and acquiescent sufferers, they are no more than exchangeable and undesignated objects. The palatial manor where the libertines indulge their unflappable sadistic games and mishmashes is less a domain of pleasure than an inescapable death camp.<br/><br/>The title isn't giving you a choice in what to formally call the movie. It's vital to Pasolini's message that the title be Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom. Oddly, the key word is ""or."" By placing de Sade's most notorious work, or anything imagined by the Marquis de Sade, in the Republic of Salò, the short-lived puppet state of Nazi Germany who staged Mussolini as leader, Pasolini screams a correlation between the dreamt-up cruelty of the libertines and the actual occurrence of Italian Fascism. Pasolini spent some of his early twenties in the Saló Republic. There, he witnessed a considerable myriad barbarities of the Fascist collaborationist forces. But this analogy does not rule out most other political and corporate machines. One doesn't have to be as patient during the film as one would think in order to see that it's not an exploitation film but an everlasting argument against the anarchy of power. Power provides such decadence and self-indulgence that life can truly but nothing but a banquet. Note the unspeakably horrific, deeply troubling ending, which not only takes the cake concerning the film's torture, gore and violence but juxtaposes it with the smugness, blindness, and desensitization of the masses. This film could easily be a metaphor for ENRON, the Bush administration, any dictatorship, Darfur, ad infinitum.<br/><br/>I'm unsure of whether I could see this film more than once. I may be able to see it again a long time from now. But isn't that a good thing? One of the most important things cinema does is jar you, make you finally, after endless media intake, say, ""Wait, what the hell am I watching?!?!?!"" I feel as if I've truly seen just how far cinema has ever gone in a particular direction. Amidst all the satires, sociopolitical commentaries, horror films or controversial cult films that have come since 1975, I don't believe any, no matter how superior in entertainment quality they are, no matter the brilliance and importance of their makers may be, have branded such an artistic scar on the common notions of the controlling human world, explored as much that is not said by accustomed depictions, exposed as much that is disremembered in social and cultural agreement.

","I realise that this is definitely not Pasolini's best, and that it's not the sort of film you can easily recommend to your friends. But I appreciate films that stir me, that shake me out of my comfortable everyday life and make me think. During the first hour or so of the film, I had a sick feeling in my stomach, like so many other people who have seen it. But afterwards I started considering it with a little more detachment, and as the sick feeling subsided, I realised what a wonderfully complex, poignant film ""Salo"" is. Pasolini depicts homosexuality among the cohort of depravities and perversions in the film, so to a certain extent he is depicting himself as a character, as one of the damned in his painting of the horrors of Hell. In ""Salo"", it is very difficult to say exactly where the social and political criticism ends, and the anguished self-portrait begins... He knew the film would shock and horrify: he is saying (to us and perhaps to himself) ""well, this monstrous thing is also me"". And as much as it is an acknowledgement, it is also an interrogation to the viewer: ""do you also see yourself in here?"". Beyond the cruelty and the nausea, ""Salo"" is a testimony of the beliefs, the fears and the struggle of a sensitive artist whose sexuality was proscribed, condemned to secrecy and vice, which soon afterward lead to his tragic death. And as such a testimony, this film really really touched me. I liked it."

","It's impossible to see this film, which arose so much controversy ever since it was released in 1975, without any kind of preconceptions. I only knew it was notorious for the violence and sex, but didn't know what kind of historical subtext and criticism of our modern day consumption society it includes. Now that I've seen it, I think it's a film of vital importance. I don't know if I have ever seen such a strong plea for a compassionate and social society, because the film shows us what the alternative is like. There is almost no element in this film, that isn't entirely dehumanized, empathy just doesn't exist. Even the weird end sentence from one of the guard boys, ""What's your girlfriends name?"", can only be understood as a mocking of which we have seen the past 120 minutes. The only human emotions are the pain and humiliation felt by the victims or the brave acts of love some of the victims share secretly."

","Thousands of films are produced worldwide annually. Yet a small proportion of those films stand the test of time and eventually become ""classics"", ""cult movies"" or both. This is a movie, which affects people in some sort of way: it inspires people to think and form an opinion about the material they watched. To my mind this is enough to justify the importance of this film. What will always stay with me is the closing scene, in which torturing takes place, underscored by the musical piece ""Veris Leta Facies"" from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana. The contrast of the tortures taking place and the sweet melody of the music (veris leta facies means ""the merry face of spring""!!!), works in a way that it gives the scene a surrealistic touch, yet all the more gruesome!<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>PS: this is one of the few movies -besides porn- which deserves to be forbidden under 18."

Anyway, I watched this movie again and was shocked again but this time by it's message to spectators about inhuman and cruel nature of Fascism. The critics, who call this masterpiece 'garbage', 'violence and torture propaganda' actually need to see this film again and again. They pay attention only to physical surface of the film without thinking about this deep and significant topic. This film is not for entertainment or pleasure, it contains cruel violent and other scenes, which you won't see in any other motion picture. But Salo's images will stay with you reminding about how horrible and guiltless human being can be.

","One comes away from Pasolini's adaptation of Sade's 120 DAYS OF SODOM with a handful of impressions: stately silence; horrors shot with an implacability that's painfully deliberate; sly asides about the hand-in-glove relationship of fascism to modernism; and an ending that, as Saint John Waters has noted, is almost sentimentally moving.<br/><br/>Is SALO a highbrow vivisection of the psychosexual dynamics of fascism, or Pasolini's home-brewed brand of snuff porn? I go with the former, though there are plenty of clues leading to the latter. In Pasolini's adaptation, a platoon of fascist aristocrats--updated from Sade's pre-fascist aristocrats--hijacks a group of peasant youths for a long weekend of humiliation, rape, and, finally, murder. Pasolini keeps things cool and dry where Sade makes them wet and frenetic; the astringency works--it puts the ideas in the foreground. And the guilt by association ascribed audiovisually to Ezra Pound and Ferdinand Leger is priceless."

PURE RUBBISH..<br/><br/>EDIT....I have now watched this film once again realizing that on my 1st viewing I was only around 17 years old and that I should give the film another try since it is so notorious. After viewing it 21 years later, I can honeslty say there are elements to this film that are quite striking. The photogaphy and and some of the settings are stunning along with the set pieces. Believe it or not, even the acting is quite extradorinary but unfortunately the boring cruelness and static nature of the film may dwarf that achievement. Many viewers have spent much time trying to evaluate and justify the images and messages of this film. In reality, it is better to learn much of the history of the film and the director before watching the film itself. This may give the viewer more insight as to what he is about to be bored and or shocked by. In the end, this film has a simple message :<br/><br/>It shows the inherent dangers of allowing any group { whether its religions, goverements, cults,etc} to have unlimited power,wealth and influence and how mankind will overuse and abuse those things to the pint of committing immorral and sick actions.

","One of the most harrowing and disturbing films ever made, SALO is nevertheless, in my opinion, one of the most moral films ever made, for it dares to explore and question not only dark areas of the human psyche, but the collective psyches of politics and religion too. Like the writings of the much misunderstood Marquis de Sade on which it is loosely based, not only does it call `Civilisation' to account, but God as well. By a process of purging, chastening and ultimately shaming us, SALO is a dreadful reminder that we live in a world where casual cruelty, covert brutality and psychological barbarism can be passed off as `normal' provided they are put into the service of the dominant ideology of the day or the political system they serve. Only when graphic cinematic images of these things are realistically shown are our `moral guardians' outraged. Although primarily using Fascist ideology as the basis on which to update the Marquis de Sade's story, Pasolini cunningly subverts his target audience and uses graphic horror and revolting images to trigger our own subconscious awareness of what cruelties society is prepared to tolerate so long as the long term benefit is delivered. (The step from the world of SALO to the vivisectionist's laboratory is just a small one). SALO has been subject to much censorship and outright bans around the world, and yet, when all is said and done, it IS only a film; a vehicle for conveying ideas, and one is left drained with despair as to just when the world will, when contemplating the actual reality of the real world, produce a parallel outrage and concern. A film which all thinking people should watch, and think on about. A quarter of a century after it was made, we are still not allowed to see this film in the United Kingdom."

","Normally in December, I spend much of my time watching jolly Christmas classics! From ""A Christmas Carol"" to ""It's a Wonderful Life"", I just cannot get enough of the heartwarming and gentle nature of the world's finest holiday cinema. However, this December seems to be going a little bit differently. Today, instead of watching something like ""Home Alone"", I watched ""Salo, or the 120 Days of Sodom""<br/><br/>Based on the novel by the infamous Marquis de Sade, ""Salo"" is among the most difficult films ever made. It contains shocking imagery and concepts throughout and has a nonstop tendency to be ugly, dark, disturbing, depressing, and DISGUSTING! Some of the behavior depicted in this film is absolutely unspeakable. Pasolini has no limits-he shows all kinds of horrific acts tacking place in this film. If you are at all in any way easily shocked avoid this film at all costs! It is not only the most disgusting film I've ever seen, but also, in its own bizarre way, the most frightening. The fact that such atrocities can (and sometimes actually DO) happen is an extremely upsetting thing to think about. The world around us is filled with the sick and the vile, and in no film is that showcased more powerfully than in ""Salo"".<br/><br/>Despite its horrifically ugly nature, I found myself absolutely loving this film! Not in the traditional sense, however, for it is hard to say that I really ""LOVED"" a film in which well over half of it contains nothing but physical and sexual torture (including the consuming of literal sh*t and the drinking of a girl's urine, as well as calm discussion about how characters murdered their own mothers). However, this film is far more than just sexual torture. It is a horrific piece of cinema, but an excellently made one at that! Pier Paolo Pasolini was one of the greatest Italian filmmakers, and he showcases his cinematic talent splendidly in this film. There are also many spectacular and haunting performances as well as some pitch-black humor which made a couple of the scenes slightly more bearable. This film is really a work of art, a satirical political statement about fascism that also contains quite a bit of explicit imagery throughout. I am willing to defend this film, despite its disgusting nature, because I legitimately do think that it is a masterpiece.

","It is impossible for me to tell you if you will enjoy watching Salo, because it is a film made for anyone able to stomach it, and while most probably can, they won't want to. Salo is, as many readers will know, often hailed as the most disgusting film ever made. That is, in my opinion, not true. Salo is disgusting, yes, extraordinarily so, but its graphic violence is not unheard of. Most horror fans will have seen more gruesome imagery than is in Salo. The reason why Salo is purportedly disgusting is not merely because of what its about, its because of how it goes about it. This is not a shock-exploitation film. It is a film that shows us sexual, physical, and mental abuse in a realistic fashion. No buckets of blood, no intestines, just violence. This is done to prove a point, which is, I think, to show just how inhumane we can be as a species. Marquis De Sade's novel on which the movie is based was made to do the same. <br/><br/>We are often very much out of touch with what members of our species are doing to one another. People who claim that Salo's level of violence is unrealistic have never heard of places like Abu Ghraib or Guantanomo Bay. People will say the movie shows political officials abusing children just to make a hackneyed political statement, and while I believe the director Pasolini did intend for their conduct to be metaphorical, I don't think that was the point of the movie. In an age of patriotism, religion, pride, zealousness, colonialism, and other such facades that we create for ourselves to convince us that we are still the good guys, Pasolini reveals that we are, in fact, not. <br/><br/>Salo was made almost forty years ago, but I cannot see a time where it will not be relevant. Until we can, as a species, unite and end these pointless wars and conflicts and battles, we will always see the kind of violence that Pasolini exhibits here. He was an angry filmmaker, and his aggression shows in a film that, without it, may have lost its way. It takes an angry, aggressive, brutish individual to remind us that we are no better, if not worse, than animals. We torture, murder, maim, abuse one another and think nothing of it. Those who don't do it directly do it indirectly, and feel content to sit on the sidelines. The movie in fact indicts the viewer for being, in essence, a voyeur into the torture of other human beings. And it couldn't be more right.<br/><br/>Many people say that certain films have to be seen to truly appreciate cinema. I am not sure if I believe that, but if it is true, Salo is one of those movies. A movie driven by an idea and a competent filmmaker, Salo is not really a film in the traditional sense. It's a piece of art, an intangible object which we can witness but never truly grasp. <br/><br/>I implore you to watch it, but be prepared to have your soul sodomized beforehand."

","""The Law prohibits something that is perfectly fictitious in the order of desire or of the instincts, so as to persuade its subjects that they had the intention corresponding to this fiction"" - Deleuze <br/><br/>Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo"" takes the Marquis de Sade's ""The 120 Days of Sodom"" and transposes it to Salo, the fascist Republic that Mussolini established in northern Italy. The film is divided into the canto-divisions of Dante's ""Inferno"", a series of cycles which represent a slow, torturous descent into hell.<br/><br/>Opening in 1944, the film watches as four dignitaries, who represent world aristocratic, ecclesiastical, judicial and economic powers, round up sixteen young men and women in a mansion near the village of Marzabotto. These ""detainees"" are the ""resistance""; the sons and daughters of partisans, or partisans themselves. For 120 days they are subjected to physical and psychological abuse by the dignitaries, before being executed.<br/><br/>The film's first canto consists of the detainees being made to sign a document, an act which echoes the formal ratification that established the Republic of Salo and marked the collaboration between Italian Fascists and Nazi Germany. The detainees are then paraded before a selection committee. Both an antechamber to hell and a slave market, they stand here as their naked bodies are examined. ""The reduction of a body to a thing through exploitation,"" Pasolini says of the sequence, the prisoners commodified and paraded before a panel of ""Masters"" who are desperately searching for ""ideal candidates"". The Masters (see Pasolini's ""Pigsty"") are themselves caricatural figureheads: a duke, a bishop, a magistrate and a banker; all figures of power.<br/><br/>The detainees are then indoctrinated into a system of ""new"" rituals and laws. Links are made between slave, servant and worker relationships, before the film proceeds to the ""The Circle of Manias"". Here, in ""The Hall of Orgies"", pornographic stories are told, which become increasingly explicit as the Masters' desires escalate. Desire then provokes will, the Masters acting out their power fantasies on their slaves. As the fantasies intensify - in an attempt to outpace desensitization - so does the sadism directed toward the slaves.<br/><br/>Parallels are then drawn between orated fantasies and cinema; the masters tell stories to elicit the consent of the slaves, whilst Passolini aligns audience narcissism to that of the Masters. The mansion then reveals itself as a place where pleasure and reality principles clash, fantasy forever attempting to overcome reality. As the masters' desires are enforceable by law, their tyranny manifests itself as a psychosis whereby desire is erased and replaced with pure intention. This then leads to the final circle: The Circle Of Death. Here, threatened by an Allied invasion, the Masters spur themselves toward the peak of fulfilment, killing and sodomising in an attempt to block out the ""reality"" outside their mansion. Their hope, the death drive writ large, is to be overwhelmed by desire and so transcend reality (the final section of Dante's poem is itself ""Paradise""). This morphs into an unconscious lust for death - the cathartic end point of all desire - a suicidal, self-destructive psychosis which is being simultaneously enacted throughout the culture in the form of war.<br/><br/>Significantly, the Masters are always portrayed as being simultaneously ""out of control"" and ""in control"". As everyone in the mansion can be either sodomite or sodomised, it is only ""speech"" which grants one power; the slaves don't talk. Only the fascists speak, and only they have desires. The film's sex is itself totally masculinized, industrialised, and focuses on the anus, scatology, homosexual fetishes and masculine domination. Pasolini was himself homosexual, and his approach to filming sex is largely why the film remains disturbing for heterosexual audiences. While many supposedly ""shocking films"" become titillative with time, Pasolini's refuses to be appropriated. Like ""Night Porter"" and ""The Damned"" (note, all directed by gays or women), Pasolini takes the fascist aesthetic, which is inherently obsessed with servitude/mastery/control/submission and an ego-maniacal glorification of death, and exposes its unconscious currents.<br/><br/>""Artists must now create works so extreme that they become unacceptable to the New State,"" Pasolini said, the ""new state"" being late-capitalism, which found with ""Salo"" a work which refused to be consumed. By unmasking both the false nature of contemporary ""tolerance"" - true tolerance has no limits - and the purely economic reasons governing ""liberalization"", Pasolini hoped to reveal how Power is disassociated from humanity, how it transforms all into objects, and the repressive and dehumanising nature of modern hedonism/consumerism.<br/><br/>More importantly, the film sketches the disavowed psycho-sexual-destructive core of capitalist social-relations. The film's abuses are not just the Masters' attempts to protect and enact fantasies, but a marker of the malfunctioning of their desires and the increasing inadequacy of their powers of fantasising. Their desires depend on dominant representations of ""perversity"" and pre-established symbolism (religious iconography, marriage rituals, infantile fecal obsessions etc) and they regard all else as ""non-desirers"" or subhumans. It is a ""freedom"" that has individualism rather than ""the social"" at its core. As absolute desire escapes the bounds of social responsibility, ethics etc, Pasolini asks to what end this leads.<br/><br/>While Pasolini's ""Canterbury Tales"" and ""Arabian Nights"" celebrated sexuality, ""Salo"" warns against a non-reflective embracing of ""desire"". Unsurprisingly, the film's mansion – an asocial utopia – parallels the creation of both the Nazi State, and all civilisations which keep the primal in check while actively drawing upon the same to maintain the status quo. It is a utopia that can only function by rejecting the desire of the Other, by foregoing the social dimension of desire, by legislating for its own pleasure, by promising ""instinctual liberty"" and non-reflexive self-centredness and by always demanding total, fearful obedience. Unsurprisingly, ""Salo"" was banned and seized by Vice Squads. Thematically it resembles Kubrick's ""Eyes Wide Shut"". Pasolini was murdered shortly before the film's release. As with Kubrick (""Eyes"" was also released after its director's passing), conspiracies surround Pasolini's death.<br/><br/>9/10 - Nauseating."

That's how I heard of this movie, and I began to research it. I was repulsed at what this film had to offer, but intrigued to see it as well. To be honest, I saw this online(Google ""salo bmetv"" and click the first link), and I have seen it about 4-5 times since, once last night.<br/><br/>If you have any moral stature, this movie will disgust you. The plot follows some leaders who own a mansion, and they take 18 teens(9 boys and 9 girls) and subject them to 4 months of excruciating torture. What kind? Well, there's a long list, including, but NOT limited to:<br/><br/>Feces eating and bathing, pee drinking(a leader forces a girl to urinate on his face, not vice versa, but it's still nasty), rape, body part burning, sodomy, perverted stories(a tame example is a 7 year old being sexually used by a teacher), the list goes on!<br/><br/>I remember the first time I saw this it was stuck in my mind when I was eating breakfast and I had to fight the final scene's images out of my head. But the more I watch it, as gross as it is, it grows on me. It's been one of my favorite movies since my first viewing.<br/><br/>If you are going to see this movie, research the heck out of it! Read You Tube reviews, Google critic's reviews, look at other IMDB reviews(that are less superior to mine-JUST JOKING!), if you can research it, read it! With these sources, you will better understand the point of the movie, that it's an allegory on governments that abuse their power(like Fascism or Nazism). In this light, Salo is a masterpiece because of that aspect alone.<br/><br/>Pier Paolo Pasolini, the writer and director, intentionally made this movie an allegory on crummy abuse of power, and his view was so strong that he was actually killed with his own car before the movie even released! Wow, what word of mouth can do!<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to those who can stand it.(It helps to know the feces is chocolate and lemonade mixed together though.) These are the main points to make about Salo, which is one of the most powerful movies ever made. Not everyone will enjoy it, and that is fine and understandable, but if you want to dare to try it, I think you should.

","I first saw Pasolini's 'Salo' at the NY film festival in 1976, introduced by Bernardo Bertolucci (who was there for his own film '1900') in the wake of Pasoliini's death (murder by serious 'critics' of the film a plausible possibility). At one point in the screening audience catcalls began (perhaps spontaneous, perhaps via organized claque), especially elicited by wonky-eyed actor Aldo Valetti in drag -- at that sight somebody shouted 'Diana Vreeland!', then general unruliness ensued. The coprophagia dinner scene pretty much emptied the auditorium -- I was one of the few who stayed to the end. <br/><br/>!! Delirious !! Illuminating !! <br/><br/>'Salo' affected this humble viewer the way one reads how very early film audiences flinched or fled the auditorium at scenes of oncoming railroad engines or ocean waves, or the way the public reacted to the original surrealists. The eyeballs are peeled raw by the incongruous images, the subversive, the anarchic -- all jarring to the subconscious. The film is a mash-up of Dante, De Sade, Nietsche, Pound, Proust, et al., with a generous helping of Jean Genet's 'The Balcony'. Shocked the F outta even young libertine me -- shocked, as in it made me sit up and take notice. Stylized presentational acting to absolute beginners giggling out-of-character, hurried reshoots and use of out-takes after some reels of the negative were stolen and offered for ransom -- it all adds to the meta, hall-of-mirrors fun.<br/><br/>'Salo' is of course full of very pretty naked bodies -- but is not a film about sex -- it is a film about rape -- rape by The State. Just when one thinks it goes to far -- omg omg omg -- until you get it: *** fascism will rape you and your children in orifices you did not know you had . . . and then kill you in ways you never imagined . . . but you and your children remain beautiful in your innocence and suffering . . . and guess what ?-- 'twas always thus and ain't never changed *** !!!<br/><br/>AH but you have to articulate that in mind later -- ain't nothing didactic in this film -- it immerses you in beauty and horror -- and comedy -- flipping your mind about at will for a couple of hours -- you cannot unsee it. I can only compare it to the experience of watching 'The Wizard of Oz' as a little kid for the first time -- one is helpless to resist its bizarre and cruel universe -- but then are rewarded with an ecstatic sense of liberation for your mere two hours of submission.<br/><br/>I have viewed 'Salo' a couple of times since its release (once at a party where the droll host set out pitchers of lemonade and bowls of unwrapped Toostie Rolls for the guests) and again recently -- it is still, forty years later, ahead of its time, and defies genre classification.<br/><br/>(Was relieved to read the cast considered it a fun set to be on -- everybody joking and laughing for the most part.

","Before viewing 'Salo,' I was told by others it is one of the grossest films I would ever see. And for most viewers, I believe that is true. I am a film writer/director and view films from a different perspective than the average. I also consider myself an intellectual. That said, on viewing the film, I was mesmerized by not only it's allegorical theme but also it's shear beauty of cinematography. For the average viewer, this is simply a cinematic story of horrible humans doing horrific things. But Pasolini is not presenting a realistic drama, he is expressing a deeper, quite poignant representation. I am not the first to say this. Many intellectuals see the film as a depiction of 1930s Italy, its fascism and the cruel legacy it left the nation's youth. Seen from this perspective, one views a totally different film, a film that presents a message as frankly and authentic as the filmmaker believes it to be himself. 'Salo' is one of many films that utilize allegory. Another much misunderstood cinematic offering is Fassbinder's 'Querelle,' based on the Jean Genet novel, equally allegorical, a study of the mind of the male sex with all it's varied characters, sexuality, self-deceit and violence within. It is truly a brilliant film. My own film 'Havana, Habana' is equally allegorical. It is the story of a spoiled American heiress who must bid farewell to her Havana play-land upon Fidel Castro's takeover, and the Cuban officer she spends the last night with who, himself, must choose between his loyalty to the old regime, or like so many of his compatriots, joining the swelling revolution. This is the surface story, but viewed from a different perspective, it is the allegorical depiction of America and it's strained relationship with its tiny neighbor Cuba. I don't recommend 'Salo' to the faint of heart nor the average film-goer. It is a rare film understood only by those who view film stories on a purely intellectual level."
"siderite","Null","4","6","8 February 2015"," Ungradable, it's an interesting experience that was never meant to be enjoyed
","From all the movies I've reviewed so far, I leave this without a vote. The idea of the movie is to show you depravity at its worst, in order to make you feel the moral outrage of Pasolini. Anyone who actually enjoyed watching the film should have their heads examined.<br/><br/>The quality of acting, directing, video and audio, etc, are really poor for today's standards and also for 1975. There is no art in the film in the sense that you could examine it in a film class and discuss camera shots. Therefore the only thing remaining to analyse is the subject. It shows teenage boys and girls being tortured by sadistic rich fascists, helped by young soldiers who are just following orders and servants who are just getting paid.<br/><br/>The degradation and torture of the kids is truly disgusting, in a way that few people can even consider sexually pleasing. The fact that they are fascists is incidental, though, and considering the film is an adaptation of a Marquis de Sade book, it is an irony that it is used to disgust people, when probably Sade was considering it a fine sexual fantasy. Actually, I never knew Pasolini; one could argue that as he was morally outraged by politics he was secretly excited by this stuff and did the greatest S&M film he could think of for purposes of self gratification.<br/><br/>For the casual viewer this film is thrice difficult to endure: film quality is low, the language is Italian and the English translation far from perfect, and the content is basically unsexy porn with a story. I mean, who would watch that? I also think Pasolini's rebellion against disgusting leaders that do their thing from depravity alone was valid, yet his method was effective only in showing us what he felt of it, rather than make us empathize with him.<br/><br/>One can see anything into anything if they make the effort. For me, I believe it was pointless to endure through this film and I would not recommend beyond knowing it exists and reading a few reviews about it. Unless you like that kind of stuff, then I totally recommend it, even if the actors are all kind of grotesque, including the teens."

","Who still reads de Sade? My guess would be that the Marquise has preciously few readers nowadays. That doesn't mean that his works are no longer relevant or even obsolete, but as far as the literacy value goes: de Sade was a keen thinker and analyst, but no literary giant. The language, even in the best translations, is so outdated, that one would almost speak about a dead language. One must pay respect to directors like Pier Pasolini to have kept the spirit and ideas behind de Sades work alive in a contemporary form.<br/><br/>The magic of Pasolinis film-making is, despite sticking to the original ideas of de Sade, he leaves enough space for the viewer to form his own opinions and interpretations. Some have seen ""Salo"" as Pasolinis views on fascism and the abuse of power, which may well be true considering the directors political orientation. However, when I had watched the infamous ""excrement-banquet""-scene for the first time and contemplated the victims complete lack of any resistance, I had to think straight of contemporary pop-culture, that is so readily gobbled up by an unresisting youth. Be it the latest shallow blockbuster, reality-TV, some YouTube-generated Pop-monstrosity or even right down to the nearest fast-food-joints – yes, there is plenty of Pasolinis ""special recipe"" going around and most of us are demanding a second serving without complaining. Quiet the opposite.<br/><br/>Much vitriol has been passed over Pasolinis final film, no further must you look than this review board. Outrage and disgust seem to prevail, both at the images and the motivation of script and director. Sure, opinions are like nostrils (to put it polite): we all have them and are entitled to one. That ""Salo"" is a piece of art however, that is no opinion that is a fact. Whether the viewer feels titillated or repulsed by what they're seeing, that is completely different issue. At least I don't know the law or book that dictates that art, philosophy or intellectual discourses have to be beautiful or uplifting.<br/><br/>Despite what your personal opinion about the director, the film or his content may be – there is no denying that it is a cinematic masterpiece and will be watched (and argued about) long, long after 90 percent of today's popcorn-cinema has disappeared into oblivion. 9/10"

","'Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom' is indeed a powerful and striking film. Meant as a metaphor of Fascism and Nazism, this work has a strong impact on its viewer. If film is an artificial medium, then Pasolini used it and pushed its boundaries to prove that there is more than artificiality in it. I think that with this feature film Pasolini is seriously questioning the true nature of film as an expressive artistic medium. The only valid comparison which comes into my mind is with Greenaway's 'The Baby of Macon'. Pasolini's and Greenaway's approaches to film are, of course, different in many ways. However, they are both questioning the nature of the film as an artificial artistic medium with these two works. While Greenaway's attempt to push the boundaries of the film is an intellectualized and analytical one, Pasolini is much more direct. He manages to shock, as well as to express in a very striking manner the essence of all human despises for humanity. He tells us what happens when people start thinking that they are better than others and develop a politically program to serve their idea. He manages to enter the darkest side of humanity and to present it in its wholeness. However sick you think this film is, or the one who directed it, you have to bear in mind all the atrocities that people are capable of provoking against their very fellows.<br/><br/>Beside shock and violence there is something more about this film. It has a very good image and the settings are remarkable in terms of architecture, shapes and colors. I consider it to be a true art work with a powerful message."

However, I was unable to fathom the degree to which he successfully embroidered either of his source inspriations--DeSade or Dante. Over the years, I've read commentaries and reviews of the work, which range from great to poor.

","Pier Paolo Pasolini's last film is one of the most revolting ever made.

In such cases any question of artistic merit would not even be considered.

"the red duchess","8","9","18","16 July 2001"," A masterpiece? Or a necessary, purging rite?
","'Salo' is very much a film of its time.  Much of its notoriety derives from the kind of taboo-breaking that was becoming increasingly prominent in the 1970s.  'Salo' is a confluence of three of these currents.  It is part of the Nazi-chic cycle (e.g. Visconti's 'The Damned'; 'The Night Porter'). <br/><br/>
Before the 1970s, World War Two films tended to portray fascism in clear-cut moral terms, with Nazis replacing the Indians of yore.  From 'the Night of the Generals' (1967) on, certain filmmakers became more interested in examining the link between totalitarian violence and sexual pathology, with their shared tenets of physical force, domination and submission, ritual acts etc.  This made a lot of people uncomfortable, and there is still a black mark over these films: is it because the horrors of Nazism were being reduced to pornography?  That carefully controlled genocide was being passed off as a mental sickness (and hence not responsible)?  That the 'sexualising' of Nazism precluded consideration of the victims?  Or was it that attributing sexual urges humanised people, even as they debased that humanity,  we'd rather dismiss as monsters?<br/><br/>'Salo' also belongs to two other, related areas of cinematic debate in the 1970s, that of (sexually related) violence (e.g. 'Straw Dogs', 'A Clockwork Orange'), and that of graphic sexuality (e.g. 'In the realm of the senses'). It may, therefore, come as a surprise with a film banned for 25 years, a film that supposedly pushes back every frontier of taste and morality, to discover how restrained 'Salo' is: the most brutal acts of violation are as chastely, coyly framed as a 40s Hollywood romance; the most exagerrated acts of violence are filmed from a distance and use obvious make-up effects; the most notorious scene, the banquet of faeces, even if it is a 'comment' on the vicious circle of consumerism or heterosexual reproduction, is more likely to provoke mirth than repulsion in these post-Farrelly Bros., post-'Eurotrash' times.<br/><br/>But if 'Salo' is of its time, it is also out of time.  By turns a black comedy and a black Mass, it is a 1970s adaptation of a book written in the 1790s and updated to the final days of Fascist Italy during World War Two. But this temporal specificity is suspended.  The film begins with a series of fascist brutalities and round-ups that we may take to have a degree of historical and geographical truth.  But even here, Pasolini pounces on our expectations.  young boys chased by the Gestapo, and being led away, we assume to be shot, are later show as policemen themselves, rounding up victims.  This playing with audience expectations will become an important part of the 'play' (in all its meanings) to follow.  <br/><br/>Similarly, the opening contrast between the cramped, dark interiors in which the four masters sit conspiring, and the open air and countryside that is the cyclists' natural environment, is a figurative imposition of Pasolini's, rather than 'realistic' or 'historical'.  The four masters are symbolic representations of the powers that upheld Fascist Italy - the Church, the Law, the Aristocracy and Finance, rather than actual examples of the ruling classes.  <br/><br/>The updating of a text eviscerating the decadence of one European class to the period of another complicates the historical recreation, but so does the story's mythical or symbolic narrative.  These are shaped by two even older narratives - the Passion of Christ (Pasolini had famously filmed 'The Gospel according to Matthew'), and Dante's Inferno.  The timelessness of 'Salo' has a religious charge, full of ceremonies, rites, costumes, codes, chants, liturgies, laws, disciples, priests, even though religion itself is banned. Iconography and Christian poses abound, leading to the ultimate crucifixion, the victims in a faecal bathtub, screaming 'Why have You forsaken me?' <br/><br/>
But 'Salo' is also an Inferno, with its circles of endless degradation, of the mind, the body and the soul, with masters and victims, storytellers and collaborators caught in an endless loop apart from the history that is playing itself out in the world outside - the profusion of mirrors, doubling, the tableaux, the ritual spaces, the mechanical gestures, only turn them back on themselves.  <br/><br/>'Salo' is the kind of film where criticisms are the same as compliments. Its monotony, its repetitiveness, its lack of psychology, its visual ugliness, its degrading the bodies of its actors, are all part of Pasolini's aesthetic.  I don't think Pasolini's intention was so much to shock as to numb, to replicate the Fascist mindset without any in-built critical get-out clause to reassure the audience.  Like all Pasolini's films, 'Salo' is literally monotonous, one tone (think of 'Gospel', 'Teorema') where a single idea is carried unswervingly through to its conclusion, without beginning or end, without variation.  <br/><br/>The recurrent theatrical spaces, dividing on-screen audience and performer (sometimes with a surreal, monolithic table), are constantly being crossed. Throughout, even within the one frame, Pasolini contrasts (negative) action and static tableaux.  In the beginning of the film, as the victims are rounded up and chosen, there is a complex play with points of view, where we are invited to share in the masters' power, culminating in the extraordinary, deadening montage of Peeping Tom violence, observed through grills.  <br/><br/>One can never easily 'take sides' with Pasolini - we remember his support of the police during the '68 protests, because they were genuinely proletarian, while the rebellious students were middle class.  'Salo' is an enervating, dispiriting, mind-sapping experience, a world where the fruits of Western civilisation (art from Giotto to Braque, quotes from great writers) become helpless, decorative, mute witnesses.  'Salo' is a remorselessly physical film - where bodies are constantly on display, used, brutalised - that is driven intellectually by ideas in part generated by the very articulate Fascists who seek to crush all thought, opposition and revolt.<br/><br/>
And yet, there are perverse moments of epiphany - the playing of Chopin, which seems to resist its debasing, the Storytelling, which has an old-world charm and artistry, even as it functions as an instrument of oppression, the tender kiss between the President and his young lover, the closing waltz - that refuse us even the safe option of unalloyed disgust."

And anyway, how hypocritical of this MARXIST to ""expose"" the brutality of a right-wing dictatorship, while supporting Communist regimes of the worst kind. For people like him, the slaughtering of millions in the name of Marx and Lenin is perfectly acceptable, it's just not okay when the extreme right-wing does it. Pasolini is just another hypocritical left-winger with nothing intelligent to convey. Has anybody ever seen a film of his that is intelligent and has a real point?

","After reading a lot of comments, it seems obvious to me that few people here have actually read Sade (or Nietsche either). ""Salo"" is a surprisingly literal version of Sade's ""120 Days of Sodom"" but without the wicked sense of humor. As much as I like Pasolini, I don't think humor was his strong suit. Similarly, his Trilogy of Life movies (""The Decameron"", ""Canterbury Tales"" and ""Arabian Nights"") captured the earthy richness of the original stories but somehow he failed to get the joke. I suspect, however, that Pasolini was drawn to Sade's book to show the flip side of his own Trilogy, much like Sade's writings skewered the philosophies of the nature- loving Rousseau. Nature is vicious and cruel, and humans are part of nature, wrote Sade. Pasolini recreates the scenarios of Sade's negative universe, almost perfectly, but misses the philosophical spirit. In other words, I think he failed. But what a kick-ass failure! I will always admire ""Salo"" for its sickening beauty, gross-out shock value, and confused/confusing ambition."
"jonathanruano","1","11","24","31 March 2009"," Salo
","In the 1960s and 1970s, Italian filmmakers in particular were fascinated by evil and Fascism and, in exploring this field, they produced a wealth of work ranging from Visconti's ""The Damned"" to Bertolucci's ""The Conformist."" Director Pier Paolo Pasolini's last film Salo comes from that tradition, but it does not deserve to be up there with those films. <br/><br/>The main weakness of Salo is its predictable and simplistic plot. In ""The Damned"" and ""The Conformist,"" the villains had ideas that gave them a sense of purpose (however misguided those ideas were), great ambitions and their behavior was so complex that they often inspired sympathy as well as enmity. But ""Salo,"" by contrast, is simply about all powerful Fascists taking pleasure raping, torturing and murdering helpless male and female teenagers. This film is as much high art as the porn films about the carrying out of rape fantasies or the slasher films are high art. Salo does not make you think. Salo does not teach you anything about the human condition. Salo does not make you feel anything except incredible disgust. Salo is just trash.<br/><br/>I usually keep an open mind about films with violence and depraved forms of sexuality. Visconti handled the violence and sexual depravity in ""The Damned"" with great skill. I also regard the torture scene in ""Last King of Scotland"" as masterful. But Salo has all of the depravity and violence, but none of the intelligence. The problem is not so much that Salo is incredibly violent and disgusting (which it is), but that these violent and disgusting scenes - which include cutting tongues, eating feces, public defecation, urinating in people's mouths, and rape(all done to young people depicted here as play things to these Fascists, which makes them appear even more worthless than the people who get killed in bad slasher movies)- are in aid of one of the most base and vile motives: to cause shock and to disgust. Pasolini also appears to have wanted Salo to be gay porn. Otherwise it is hard to explain why Pasolini filmed handsome bare chested male models and homosexual intercourse. Now once again, I have nothing against gay porn. But this kind of gay porn is unlikely to excite the libido of most homosexuals because it is undermined by the violence and feces eating (which the overwhelming majority of porn directors have the good sense not to put in their films). Salo will also not appeal to the overwhelming majority of heterosexuals because unlike other films that deal with gay romance, like Neil Jordan's brilliant film ""The Crying Game,"" it is lacking in tenderness and humanity. <br/><br/>If you think about it, Salo is really a self-indulgent exploitation film. Pasolini tried to show his audience that he could be disgusting and shocking in ways that could hardly be imagined and, in that respect, he succeeded brilliantly. But the film is rubbish in the most depressing and mean-spirited sort of way from beginning to end. To say that the film Salo is bad would be unfair to the directors of other bad films, like Ed Wood of ""Glen and Glenda,"" Randal Kleiser of ""Return to the Blue Lagoon,"" and Dolph Lungren of ""Icarus.""<br/><br/>No Stars"

The source material is challenging and this film's exploration of human exploitation is relentless, but I can't think of a film more courageous in its commitment to its themes. The film has rich sound design, some wonderful moments where the fading characteristics of humanity escape from even the most despicable antagonists, and Pasolini never fails to include wonderful shots of poetic Italian architecture to contrast horrors that pervade the walls of the manor.<br/><br/>What most impresses me is that Pasolini is absolutely protective and respectful of the actors he uses in this film. As far as one can express regarding a film about sexual degradation, this is very carefully choreographed so that though these actors portray exploited victims, they themselves are never exploited. The film is graphic without being explicit. This film is overtly sexual without being the least bit pornographic. Lesser films and lesser directors would not handle the material as deftly as done so here.<br/><br/>For a true cinephile, this is a must see film. There are far more manipulative films out in the world that take real pleasure in gratuitously exploiting every aspect of their production. This truly is not one of those films. Pasolini bravely confronts de Sade's text and does so with the artistic integrity expected of a cinematic genius."
"jamesledesma","10","4","7","5 July 2014"," In a world jaded on shock, Salo provokes thought.
","Interesting that the majority of negative reviews concerning ""Salo"" feel the need to point out that it wasn't shocking. Obviously these people were looking for something shocking, along the lines of ""Faces Of Death"" or something that wouldn't have been out of place on Rotten.com. Instead, they got an intense film with something to say about the world around us, and felt gypped because it was't shocking enough. <br/><br/>Ironically, that's the point-of-view of the four aristocrats in this motion picture, and it's also the point-of-view of Marquis de Sade, whose ""120 Days Of Sodom"" this movie is based upon: nothing is shocking, so do what you want... especially if you have the authority to do so and no one can stop you. Jaded beyond their conscience, the four monsters in this movie spend the last remaining days of WWII indulging in the worst fantasies they could conjure, possibly because they know that at any moment the war will be over and their dream of Italian fascist victory will be wiped out.<br/><br/>Incidentally, this movie isn't about fascism; it's about power, what Pasolini described as the purest form of anarchy because the powerful can do whatever they please. It reminded me a lot of Burroughs' ""Naked Lunch"" and if there ever was a film that came closest to depicting the events of that controversial novel, it is ""Salo"". (The Cronenberg adaptation of ""Naked Lunch"" is great, but could not be a literal adaptation because of the subject matter) <br/><br/>Burroughs' novel was also preoccupied with the pyramids of power, between the oppressors and the oppressed. Both used repulsive imagery to convey their message. There is even a touch of black humor in both works. Ultimately, neither the Burroughs novel nor the movie ""Salo"" are for the squeamish... or the weak-minded, for that matter.<br/><br/>It is not for everyone, but it is not trash either. ""Salo"" has meaning and depth, if people could get past the horror at the surface and see that the real horror of the movie is that those in positions to affect change-- for example, the armed thugs or the piano player --do nothing, and allow these unspeakable acts to continue. After a while, even the victims themselves turn on each other, ratting each other out and identifying with their tormentors.<br/><br/>This movie is about the wretched human condition, and if you weren't shocked or disgusted by it... then maybe it's because your world view was depicted in the movie and you couldn't take the mirror being held up to your face. ""Salo"" is not an easy movie to take, but it is valuable as a work of art.<br/><br/>I also want to add one last note: The source material for this film was also referenced in Luis Bunuel's ""L'Age d'Or"" and caused just as much of a sensation as ""Salo"" did but with none of the violence or sex. Bunuel made the same point about power and religion by referencing Sade in his movie, and it's a valid point as well. Being Spanish and affected by fascism in his homeland, the finale to Bunuel's movie is similar to Pasolini's feelings about Mussolini throughout ""Salo"". Perhaps this was intentional on Pasolini's part... who knows? Its meaning was not lost on me, that's for sure."
"ThreeSadTigers","Null","4","7","14 May 2008"," Vile? Disgusting? Shocking?  that's the point!
","It's odd reading the other reviews of this film, in particular, the negative ones. It seems that many people consider it a failure for the very aspects that Pasolini deliberately incorporated in an attempt to make his attack more comprehensible and concise. The brutality, the coldness, the sense of intrusion expressed by both the editing and the cinematography are all deliberate choices on the part of the filmmaker to further refine his political and personal message until it becomes absolutely clear. If, for whatever reason, you found it shocking - disgusting even - then good! That was Pasolini's intention. The film uses the writing of the Marquis de Sade to form a metaphor for the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini and of the violence and brutality of the Fascist collaborationist forces of the Salò Republic, with the scenes of abuse, torture, rape and humiliation not only stressing the actual violence of the era in which the film is set, but also working on a symbolic level, removed from the more adolescent aspects of the Marquis' original text.<br/><br/>If you think the film is ugly, sick, shocking and disgusting, then you're seeing it film from the director's own personal perspective. However, to denounce the film for these very reasons, without at least thinking about why these images and situations are shocking to you, is missing the ultimate point. It's shocking, not only because it happened, but for the fact that it's happening again! Your disgust is Pasolini's disgust. He made this film out of anger, not celebration, and if you denounce the film for the depiction of the world that it presents then you're refusing to learn from these past mistakes and leave yourself open to a repeat of this kind of behaviour. If you think this kind of reasoning is melodramatic or pretentious, just look around you. Terrorist attacks, a denouncement of faith, cynicism, the worshipping of consumer culture, apathy, greed, war, illness, the treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay or the atrocities of Abu Ghraib, etc. If you can't make these comparisons when watching the film, then you're doomed, and if you think that Pasolini made the film out of some kind of sick sexual urge (as opposed to a genuine sense of fear, concern and aggression) then you're not really ready for a film of this particular weight.<br/><br/>It has nothing to do with entertainment or whether or not you like or dislike the film. The ultimate concern is the reaction that is felt and the issues that are raised. I suppose it seems an almost absurd consideration today, but films like this weren't made for the reasons of entertainment or financial gain, with the subsequent notion of the film being freely available on DVD to be ""enjoyed"" (or endured) in the privacy of your own home no doubt being a great insult to Pasolini and to his intentions for the film. The point of Salò (1975) is to make us think and feel. If it achieves this goal then the film is a success. With films being produced today for no other reason than to make lots money and serve the masses in a way that's acts as an easy distraction to the problems of everyday life, it's hard to accept that Pasolini intended Salò to be a derisive film; one that would not be liked or enjoyed, but rather, one that would provoke thought and response.<br/><br/>It certainly wasn't the filmmaker's intention for this film to revel in the violence presented on screen, but instead, to comment on the violence that thrives in the supposed pursuit of truth and freedom. Think about the time at which this film was released - the Vietnam War, the massacre of My Lai and its sad echoes of the rape of Nanking or the lingering horrors of the Holocaust - and then place them into the context of the film itself. Run some of these references through an internet search engine and you'll find images and accounts that are far more heartbreaking and distressing than anything presented in this film, and only then will you understand Pasolini's anger and disgust that he chose to articulate, not through the cold function of essay, but through the visceral immediacy of his art. Like the similarly controversial exploitation film Cannibal Holocaust (1980), the presentation of Salò is brutal, ugly and depressing; intended to shock viewers to the extent of never wanting to see the film again.<br/><br/>You can't critique it on the level of something as conventional as Platoon (1985) or Schindler's List (1993), films that take the horrors of the past and turn them into effective melodrama. Salò doesn't concern itself which such notions. A rating between 1 and 10 really doesn't apply for a work of this nature as I'm not sure what most viewers are grading it on. If you feel it doesn't offer entertainment, then you're right, and Pasolini never saw himself as an entertainer. He was a well respected artist, novelist, poet and filmmaker very much interested in the human condition. Look at a film like The Gospel According to St. Mathew (1964) or The Hawks and the Sparrows (1966) to see the emotion and the humanity often present in his far more rewarding works. These things are lacking from Salò for a reason. As one particularly learned reviewer put it, Salò is less a polemic on dictatorship or contemporary political atrocity, than a necessary, purging rite."

"lemon_magic","4","7","15","16 June 2005"," Kudos for the controversy of its themes, but Salo can't live up to its promises
","The friend who showed me this film wanted to share it because he thought it was 'the most disgusting' film he'd ever seen. He was anxious to see what someone else thought about it, given its reputation (or infamy). Well, I agree that it is disgusting and disturbing, but I mostly feel that 'Salo' is a well-meant waste of film.<br/><br/>Just to be clear, I don't condemn or censure anyone for wanting to make more of this film than what it is. Everyone hopes that almost any 'arthouse' film they view will be a Life Changing Experience, or at least something enlivening and special. And ""Salo"" certainly pushes all the right buttons.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have gone on at length about the film's themes and plot; I appreciate the way they took the trouble to clarify issues, plot devices and characters that I missed or misunderstood in my one recent viewing of ""Salo"". For instance, I didn't quite process the fact that the four young men who were initially grabbed by the older thugs were later part of the oppressors, or that there were four younger prostitutes accompanying the four Madams - there were so many people milling around in various states of undress,and so many grainy, static long distance shots of bodies that it was hard to keep things straight. I certainly missed the aural cues regarding the ongoing Allied bombing raids that drove the action further and further into the depths of the villa. (This may have been due to the limitations of the laser disk format the movie was in). And since everything was in subtitles, I sometimes lost track of who was saying what and which character was the Duke, which the President, etc.<br/><br/>I strongly agree that while 'Salo' may resemble a snuff film or a bad porno film in spots, it is not in fact, pornographic. The potentially sensationalistic violations, perversions,tortures and murders in the film are shot in static, grainy, 'cinema verite' documentary style with almost completely flattened affect - there are very few 'shocking' full screen close ups, no huge orchestral blasts on the soundtrack (only piano dirges), no lingering sensual shots of the violated bodies and orifices. In fact, the final round of tortures and murders are viewed from far away, through binoculars and a window, in complete silence.<br/><br/>So it really seems to me that the director was relying on the sheer disturbing power of De Sade's ideas, plus the audiences' easy reflexive loathing of Fascism and things like pederasty and rape, to make the movie succeed - the sequences he shot were meant to simply serve as vehicles to invoking those emotions and reactions to VERY BAD THINGS that we already knew were bad. And as other reviewers have mentioned, the director's rage and disgust with humanity was obvious, and comes through loud and clear with every new scene. <br/><br/>So in the end, in any discussion of the film's worth , the question should not be, 'Does ""Salo"" successfully invoke the audiences' contempt and disgust for easy targets like De Sade and Fascism and the corrupt aristocracy of decadent cultures?' but rather, ""Does ""Salo"" do anything worthwhile with the contempt and disgust it invokes?"" I think it does not. <br/><br/>Any decent noir film also carries the theme that ""People Are No Damned Good"", and does it much better. ""Salo's"" particular gimmick is that it invokes ""the Child Card"" - because the victims are adolescents, somehow the moral outrage this engenders is supposed to ennoble the viewer. And easy reflexive outrage and disgust is the cheapest and most manipulative storytelling gimmick of all. (I will admit that the most disturbing part of the movie derives from the seeming apathy and even collaboration of many of the young victims. But even this is just the Stockholm Syndrome writ large). <br/><br/>There are some reviewers who claim that part of the power of ""Salo"" is that it indicts the audience for acting as voyeurs and participants of the proceedings, or sneers at the viewer for cowardice if he chooses to stop watching.<br/><br/>This, to me, is simply a story teller's version of the old rhetorical trick of ""Seizing the Moral High Ground"". Because Pasolini is making a movie about something IMPORTANT, he wants you to think that the movie itself becomes the arbiter of the worth of your reaction to it. That is not the case, I assure you, any more than watching any of the Star Wars movies makes you a Jedi or a Sith Lord.<br/><br/>A much more honest reaction to this gimmick is: ""Hey, YOU made the film, buddy, not me. It's YOUR obsessions up there on the screen, not mine. You spent hundreds/thousands of hours and thousands of dollars and the collaborative efforts of hundreds of people to put your vision on film. I'm just watching this thing to see what you have to say, and how well you say it. That doesn't make you my moral arbiter or superior, just a great project manager. So how good a story teller are you REALLY??"" The answer, for Pasolini and ""Salo"", is ""a lot shallower and less profound than the movie pretends"". <br/><br/>So MY reaction to ""Salo"" is,essentially, ""Meh!"" It may be somewhat less emotionally manipulative than a Spielberg movie, but it is not nearly as complex or subtle or honest as many of its European film counterparts, even ones warning of the dangers of Fascism. It may be worth watching once, to see what the fuss is about, but it is not worth seeking out or going to any effort to acquire. You would be much better off to read someone like Hannah Arendt, or Susan Sontag, or Isiah Berlin if you want insights into the uglier sides of human nature, AND you don't have to watch people eat simulated human turds. <br/><br/>No real purpose was ever served by watching people eat simulated human turds."

","This, Pier P.Pasolini's final work (and the third in the trilogy of films adapted from novels)is probably one of the hardest films you will ever be subjected to. The film, adapted from the Marquis DeSade's 'The 120 Days' is set during the final days of fascism in Italy, during 1944,when a group of Fascists take a batch of newly arrested Communist youths to a swanky house in the countryside, and subject them to four months of some of the most de humanizing,degrading forms of humiliation,torture & eventual horrific deaths that one could hope to see on screen. This film even managed to gross out Al Goldstein,publisher of Screw Magazine,resulting in his walking out on it. What makes this film more hard to watch,in contrast to some of the Italian horror films of the same era (with some pretty horrific & graphic violence)is that things like the stuff that's depicted in the film actually happened.

However, I think Salo is a better film than those two. Pasolini actually has some sense of artistry, and, if you can stand it, Salo is actually a very well made film. It's agenda is nothing but a front - yes, we already know that fascism is bad. No, this film reveals much more about its own creator than anything else. It's a playground for his fantasies. But I believe he must have known that. The plot proceeds very logically and the suspense and horror grow exponentially. Pasolini knew that he who had free reign would end up going too far. The final act is as brilliant as it is stomach-churning, and it's no coincidence that the President and many of his top-ranking men only watch it indoors with binoculars. I think this wins the contest for the best movie that you can hardly bring yourself to watch. 9/10."

","I stumbled onto this film from a list of notable Italian films. I read what the film was about and the controversy it caused when it was released so I was curious to watch it. I finally found it online and saw it. I almost want to say that I made a mistake in seeing this film because it is the single most depressing and disturbing film I think I've ever seen.<br/><br/>It takes place in WWII fascist Italy and deals with a group of senior members of government rounding up 18 young men and women to take them to a secluded palace with a plan to torture and sexually degrade them. The film is broken up into 4 segments, gradually becoming more disturbing. The men of power take great sexual pleasure from seeing their captives submit to their disgusting acts. I wont go into detail but this film has some of the most disturbing and sadistic scenes I have ever witnessed. There is a level of bleakness from what is shown that is deeply depressing. I felt angry throughout the film that the captives didn't rebel, there are a couple that try but are severely punished. There is only really one moment when a girl cries and pleads for G-d to save her from her suffering but the film does not show these people to have any other emotions other than terror. Of course, I am sure that it was Pier Paolo Pasolini's intention but the darkness of this film is almost overwhelming. Pasolini I feel wanted this film to be a mirror to humanity and our ability for cruelty. There is nothing in this film that could be construed as entertainment. I feel dirty for having viewed it. Again, that was probably the point. How many films do we watch that have sex and violence do we regard as entertainment? It's true, some films do glorify some of our darkest impulses. This film does none of that. It is very bleak and doesn't offer any hope. Is it a good film? I can't say yes. I am giving it a bad rating and won't recommend it because watching it was so unsettling. That is the reaction that Pasolini wanted. In that he succeeded. I will never see this film again, but I will never forget it."

Sure you can call it criticism when you have fascists rape children and eat feces, and you could criticize Nazi-Germany by having an SS-officer sodomize a pig and eat human flesh, but what does that have to do with anything? Pier Paolo Pasolini was fired from his position as a teacher because of charges of immoral behavior (not his political views as many sources claim), and he discovered his homosexuality by falling in love with one of his students. I'm all for homosexuals, but not creepy pedophiles. In my opinion this movie can tell you a lot more about the writer than the fascist regime of the 40's Italy.

","SALO isn't gay porn ...or even an updating/retelling of the Marquis De Sade's ""The 120 Days of Sodom"". That book was left open-ended because De Sade bade his readers to finish it for themselves -and this is exactly what Pier Paolo Pasolini has done. Key to the film's understanding is a knowledge of the incomplete De Sade work.<br/><br/>Here are excerpts from the unfinished ""Les 120 Journees De Sodome"":<br/><br/>""And now friend-reader, you must prepare ...for the most impure tale that ever has been told since our world began..."" ""Four accomplished procurers to recruit ...Four supper parties were held regularly every week in four different country houses located at four different extremities of Paris."" On the Madames(the procurers): ""It is commonly accepted amongst authentic libertines that the sensations communicated by the organs of hearing are the most flattering ...our four villains...devised something quite clever indeed. It was this: ...the plan was to have described to them, in the greatest detail and in due order, every one of the debauchery's extravagances..."" The ""STATUTES"": ""The salon shall be heated to an unusual temperature, and ...All present shall be naked..."" Next come the tales, divided into 4 parts: ""SIMPLE PASSIONS"", ""150 COMPLEX PASSIONS"", ""150 CRIMINAL PASSIONS"", and ""150 MURDEROUS PASSIONS"". The final wrap-up: ""Their sufferings were long, cruel and various... you will give details at your leisure and where you see fit...sprinkle in whatever tortures you like."" ""Salo"" is MORE than an updating of De Sade. Pasolini finished ""the most horrific book"" for ""the master philosopher"" and added in the legend of biblical Sodom in it's final days. This time out it wasn't God but Allied bomber planes that rained fire and brimstone down.<br/><br/>The film begins with the Presidente and his three dignitary cronies solemnly making a pact around a conference table when all is lost at the tail-end of World War II. They commit to finishing De Sade's book by living it. ""Very well, then, let's do it."" The four dignitaries begin acting out Sade's completed part of the book before entering an opulent, secluded villa to await the inevitable end. Once locked inside, they fill in the unfinished parts. Four young soldiers are sent to find exactly what was needed. Three ""Madames"" are brought along to provide the aural ""passion tales"" needed to impel the proceedings. Nine young men and nine young women are rounded up from the countryside and a nearby convent to be the ""guests""... Just before entering the villa, the Presidente"" starts reading the statutes from De Sade's book and henceforth these will be the rules of conduct until the end. Once inside, the young soldiers shed their respective uniforms and become one with the convent girls and country boys. Some are transfixed by fear while others take an interest in the Madame's first tale. There are rapes and fear in the ""villa/Inferno"" at the outset, but the AURAL is key in this film. Between the bombing and the tales, all men are erect after awhile and the youths return kisses and even initiate some sex. By the second ""Circle"" tale, most are into it and by the third there's no difference between any of those in Sodom/Hell. The ""fire and brimstone"" sounds of Allied bombing starts once all are inside and continues until the film's end. To escape it, they head further into the bowels of the villa. There they watch a young couple deflower each other, then rape the couple and get raped while raping. This frenzy is the result of Madame's AURAL tales and the relentless bombing of the countryside. No love and no mention of God are allowed during ""the exquisite pleasures"". A night raidby the elders results in uncovering the ""natural"" (and therefore rule-breaking) coupling of a young soldier and maid. The final two tales are KEY as they tell all assembled what's in store although they no longer seem to care. The 3rd tale tells of the exquisite ecstasies of having sex with those close to death and the orgies intensify. The three Madames are muses for those assembled and together they symbolically represent the SPIRIT of De Sade; the ""master pervert"" who crosses over into each of their tales is De Sade himself. The head Madame shows icy glee as she relates the last line of the FINAL tale: near the moment of your own death, ""kill as many human beings as possible!"" THE FINAL SCENE: The Presidente watches through binoculars as the young head into the courtyard below. Scalping, branding, whippings, rape, eye-gouging and tongue-cutting become the ultimate pleasures of sharks on a feeding frenzy. Experiencing the ultimate ecstasies, the three elder Fascist dignitaries also in the courtyard lock arms and do a ""rockette's dance"". Inside, a soldier turns the radio station to a waltz tune and shyly asks another soldier to dance. As they begin the screen abruptly cuts to black with the words ""FINE"". The bombs had obliterated the château.<br/><br/>The film is literally ""The 120 Days of Sodom"" with the title-card after opening credits saying ""1944-1945"". The acting out and rounding up took about 30 minutes of real time and 116 days of reel time. Once all enter the villa/Inferno, they're in Hell, living out Sodom's last 4 days before the Allied bombers hit their marks."

","A friend and I went to a screening of this film last night. Because of reviews I had read I expected this film to be the very spawn of Hell, because most of the reviews described this film as not only disturbing, but many of them said that it was the most atrocious film they had ever seen.<br/><br/>
Indeed, this film is disturbing, mostly because similar tortures are still carried out today, under fascist regimes; when absolute power is given to one person, or a small group of people, carries the danger of absolute corruption. Through absolute corruption, the depths of evil are endless. This is the true message of both Pasolini's film and the Marquis De Sade's novel. And like the Marquis De Sade, Pasolini chooses satire as his vehicle to convey this message. <br/><br/>Upon viewing this film, both my friend and I agreed that the film was more of a black comedy than a heavy drama. We found the performances to be, thematically, comedic. Also the ridiculousness of many of the stories and situations lead us to view this film as a rather vicious satire. This film does succeed in being a masterpiece, because despite the fact that this film is a comedy, Pasolini's anti-fascist (and Sade's anti-libertine) message is not lost. In fact, I believe that the film was truly made in the spirit of the Marquis De Sade: the ultimate goal being making the libertines look like not only the sheer embodiment of evil, but to also paint a picture of the libertine's foolish behavior. The victims are treated like animals, but the libertines are really the animals.<br/><br/>Through careful analysis of this film and the Marquis De Sade's Novel, I can conclude that both the film is indeed a masterpiece of the most twisted nature. It is truly a valid film. Whether the viewer sees this film as a heavy, oppressive drama, or as a hideous burlesque, one thing is for certain, this film is a strong statement against absolute power."

","Pier Paolo Pasolini's final film, based on The Marquis De Sade's magnum opus, is a force to be reckoned with. The film contains some of the hardest, most grueling scenes in all of cinema, yet it never loses its' laser sharp focus. The film never becomes exploitative, despite its' explicit content. Everything is portrayed in a tasteful way, every action is integral to the story. Not a moment is wasted, not a punch is held back."

","First off, this is not a pleasant, fun or ""cool"" movie. It is not for people that can be offended by a film. It is not for people that believe that movies must have limits on their content. If you like to assume you are a ""tough"" guy or gal, but in reality are sensitive to certain types of shocking behaviors, find some other form of ""entertainment"" than this. Do yourself a big favor and heed the warnings above, I'm not kidding!<br/><br/>All of that being said, this film is incredible if you can stomach the content. The movie is essentially anti-fascist or just anti-absolutist power propaganda and a terrifying warning. However, it is done in such a way as to pull you into the horror of unchecked power, e.g. Fascism, causing you to viscerally feel the evil these people are not only capable of, but feel entitled to inflict on others as casually as ordering a glass of wine at a restaurant. It is one thing to talk about the depths of evil, depravity and perversion that people can stoop to, it is quite another to experience it visually in the hands of talented director(s) actors and actresses.<br/><br/>In actuality, this is a horror movie. As such, it contains the horrific truth about the practice of fascism and where it always and ultimately leads if allowed to persist. In the end, it always results in the most horrific behaviors, the cruelest debasements and the total perversion of what it is to be human. Watching this, it slowly becomes sickeningly apparent how easily the horrific evils of WWII were released upon humanity by monsters, some who may have once been human.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the film incorporates pieces of Dante's Inferno interwoven with the story in order to demonstrate how easily hell can be found on earth. If you have read the Inferno, you know there are some disgusting punishments waiting for the damned. However, what it doesn't tell you is that the damned were the ones who invented said tortures in the first place.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie is most definitely art. Nowhere does it say that art is supposed to be pleasant, uplifting, happy and something you want to take home to grandma and the kids. Quite the contrary, sometimes art is shocking, sickening and disgusting. This movie is all of those things and more. If you are wearing life's ""rose-coloured glasses"", expect them to be torn off by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, if you do decide to watch the movie, you might want to give some thought as to what the people involved in making it went through to complete it.

"husks","7","3","5","31 January 2008"," Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom
","You'll see more graphic sex and violence in other films but these are usually punctuations within a wider context - in SALO these elements are present constantly. Not for one moment are we offered any relief from the emotional and psychological torment being inflicted upon the fascist's victims, and just when we think the film is all bark and no bite, it offers a final scene that is horrific not only for what it portrays but because it can be the only logical conclusion.<br/><br/>I believe that SALO is not as controversial for its content as it is for the conditions it imposes upon the viewer from the outset: that there is no hope, that there will be no rescue, that these young people will suffer and that we will be witness to every moment of it. Because we accept these conditions and view on regardless we get the feeling that we are conspiring with an agenda of the film-maker's. Is it a film that exists more in the reaction to its content than the content itself? Is the event of the film emulating the anarchic argument behind De Sade's own scandalous writings? What's problematic with SALO is that by means of blasphemy, cruelty or depravity it positions itself as a dialogue with which the audience cannot help but engage, overwhelming conventional attitudes of storyline or character.<br/><br/>I also can't help feeling that Pasolini's decision to update the text to a wartime setting is pure strategy on his part, as if allegory conveniently excuses his indulgence. It's not a film that should be banned (there were lines around the block when I went to see it), or that people should be discouraged from seeing, or that most people should be encouraged to see, for that matter. Ultimately, despite its controversy, I'm left with a muddled reaction to SALO. It's certainly disturbing, but probably for the wrong reasons. Just as De Sade's book tells you more about the man who wrote it than the work itself, so too do I think less of SALO as a film than the end-product of the man who made it."
"scgary66","8","3","5","24 May 2002"," A tale of timeless horror
","Not specifically a film about either fascism, World War II Italy, or sexual gratification, this is more accurately a film about how the unlimited exercise of brutal power can never truly achieve the satisfaction its perpetrators hope for. In the film, 17 teenagers  - specifically selected for their physical beauty and perfection - are captured and taken to an isolated estate (an 18th is killed en route), to be used for the complete personal and brutal gratification of four local officials. The youths are required to abandon any sense of personal identity (beyond their names), and forbidden to demonstrate any religious practices or engage in any unauthorized sexual activity. Based on the writings of the Marquis deSade, and featuring references to various other works of the past few centuries, the film is set in late WWII Italy most likely because it presented the most dramatic and accessible recent scenario for the depiction of unrestrained totalitarian power (at least for an Italian director who lived in that environment); the film could just as easily have been set in Eastern Europe during the Cold War, or in any number of recent locales where anarchistic brutality has ruled.<br/><br/>The four officials set about creating what they believe to be the perfect environment in which to satisfy their most savage fantasies, using several middle-aged women as ""narrators"" of explicit tales meant to inspire sessions of unbridled dabauchery. What transpires, however, is not an orgy of wild abandon but rather a series of episodes where the officials' lusts are satisfied fleetingly, incompletely, or not at all. In fact, they seem to take greater pleasure from the devising of new ideas, rules, and situations, than in actually carrying them out. Increasingly, any deviation from the most precise demands possible serves only to frustrate their passion and dissipate their desire. They turn progressively to more degrading means of torture, hoping to gain at least some measure of satisfaction.<br/><br/>The film certainly is executed with a great deal of skill; the technical aspects are outstanding, with the exception of the poor sound quality (typical of Pasolini). The filmmakers have thoroughly succeeded in creating an atmosphere of tightly controlled grotesquery and chillingly banal brutalism. One gets the sense that they achieved exactly the film they were trying to make. And the acting style, while essentially amateurish, does in a sense make the film seem less artificial for it.<br/><br/>Those expecting titillation or graphic depictions of sex acts will no doubt be disappointed (or relieved, depending on your interest here), as virtually all of the most graphic segments are either conducted (slightly) offscreen, partially obscured, viewed from a distance too far to permit close examination, or achieved through fairly seamless and accomplished editing. (The few closeups are seemingly applied to get the audience to think they're seeing something more ""real"" than is perhaps the case.) There is, no doubt, much more graphic sexual content in the first few minutes of a standard pornographic video than is to be found in the entirety here. And given the cold, detached, consistently morbid atmosphere maintained throughout the film, it's difficult to imagine anyone being aroused by the proceedings. (I, for one, would not like to meet anyone who could.) Apparently the furor surrounding this film was inspired not by actual depictions of atrocities, but by the idea that merely dealing with such subjects at all is unacceptable.<br/><br/>To be clear, this is NOT a film for anyone under 18; for that matter, it's hard to imagine any age at which someone might ""typically"" be considered ready to deal with such a film as this, but I personally can't imagine any sense of why someone would think someone under 18 OUGHT to see this film. The teenagers depicted, though some reviewers have described them as children, all appear to be at least 16 (the age of consent in most of Europe, I believe). Admittedly, my one of my main difficulties in watching was not simply the depiction of atrocities (which I reasonably believe to be simulated, without exception), but in my discomfort at knowing what the actors were required to endure here; it's unsurprising that few (if any) of the actors here had any previous or later acting experience, though this is probably par for the course in a Pasolini film. And while the 17 teenage performers (and a handful of adult guards) might be described objectively as beautiful, complete nudity is presented in such fleeting instances that anyone seeking the film for pleasure for that purpose is doubtless better off looking elsewhere.<br/><br/>Admittedly, this is a difficult film to rate; it's certainly not ""enjoyable"" in any conventional sense. But what is accomplished is an steadily increasing sense of horror (not fear or disgust) throughout, recognizing the monstrosities of which people are capable when stripped of any restraint on their power, or allowed to abandon their humanity. The last 20 minutes, in particular, are an unrelentingly horrifying showcase of physical torments - no less so for realizing it's not ""real."" There ARE real monsters in the world, and it's perhaps better to recognize them, and what they  - or we - can become, if we trade our humanity for power and desire.<br/><br/>8 of 10"

Pasolini made some good films (""Arabian Nights"")--too bad this was his last one. I was ""lucky"" enough to see it in a theatre a few years ago--the audience groaned and booed and hissed at the end. Pasolini did NOT have to throw ever single torture and degradation in our faces--he seems to actually enjoy it! He could have made his point without being so needlessly sick. Some people go on and on saying this is a masterpiece. Bull! It's just a sick, degrading movie that tries to make a point (absolute power corrupts) while just pushing offensive material into the audiences faces. This film is no artistic achievement--it's, in my book, the worst film ever made. UPDATE! Criterion released it about a year ago and people are going on and on saying Criterion only releases artistic films of merit. Uh huh (EXTREME sarcasm).

","This has got to be one of, if not THE most over-hyped film ever. Many horror and extreme film lovers seek this film out because of all the references to the ""horrible"" and ""disgusting"" depictions of violence and deviant sex that are in Salo. Unfortunately, it's almost all bull****! This film is laughable at best- the only thing ""extreme"" about this film is the extreme disappointment I felt after having sat through this garbage. If you find people eating s**t and getting p**sed on extreme - than i guess you may want to check this out for yourself. The violence is extremely understated, and the only ""graphic"" violence is at the very end, and that is viewed through a pair of backwards binoculars so that i had to use the zoom mode on my t.v. to even see what the hell was going on.... I understand that this film may have been considered really racy in 1976, and I can see how your average, everyday theater goer would be shocked by the content in this film, but be honest...anyone viewing this film nowdays is only doing so because they've done the research and wants to see what all the fuss is about. This is not a film you just ""come across"" at the local video store. But in my opinion - anyone who has seen any Cat III Asian films,or any of the more notorious Euro Horror/Exploit, or some of the more recent underground independent horror films from the States and abroad, will find nothing that outrageous in Salo. The only redeeming quality about this film is when the old hookers are talking about getting p**sed and s**t on- those scenes are absolutely hilarious and steal the whole show. Salo has no quality as any sort of social commentary - it's about a bunch of old f**ks that like to molest kids and eat s**t. As far as I'm concerned, Salo just doesn't have anything going for it other than the colorful dialogue of the old prostitutes, and that in and of itself does not save this film. If you are still desperate to see this over-hyped garbage, DO NOT be one of the fools that is paying as much as $1000 for a criterion copy of this film. There are plenty of dealers on-line and at the horror conventions that sell non-criterion copies for around $30 - or better yet find a $5 bootleg and at least you won't be too irritated that you wasted your money on this crap. 3/10 - but only for the s**t eating hookers!!!"
"BA_Harrison","8","4","8","14 November 2013"," Not for the easily offended.
","Two hours of human debasement, Sadean perversion, and random killing, Salò's raison d'être is to make the viewer feel as uncomfortable as it possibly can, forcing them to acknowledge humanity's capacity for corruption, depravity and cruelty; in that it succeeds brilliantly, successfully driving home the fact that, as Slipknot so succinctly put it, people=s**t.<br/><br/>Although based on a work by Marquis de Sade, the film is set the film during WWII (an era still within living memory for many during the mid-70s) making the horror and wickedness depicted all the more real for those brave enough to watch. As the film's four fascist libertines put their victims through all manner of physical and mental torture, Pasolini captures every last perverted detail, easily qualifying the film as one of the most controversial pieces of cinema ever made.<br/><br/>I had heard quite a lot about Salò before watching, enough to let me know that I was in for a very uncomfortable watch, and almost enough to put me off from watching it altogether; however, it was a film that I felt I had to endure in order to keep my self-proclaimed status as a connoisseur of extreme cinema. Although it was undeniably a very gruelling experience, man-love and poop-munching not being among my favourite subjects for an evening's entertainment, I'm glad I stuck with it, partly because I can now finally tick it off 'the list', but also because the film simply works, both as a work of art and as a slice of shocking exploitation.<br/><br/>I rate Salò 8/10, not for enjoyment, but simply for taking no prisoners."

","There isn't much point in dwelling on anything that happens in Salo, it's all been done before, and since with much greater gore/special effects/drama. What this film really has going for it, is the devout fanbase, who swear blind that this film is a work of art that you really can't help but appreciate and be bowled over by, unless you're some sort of philistine.<br/><br/>I suppose I must just be a philistine, but it seems to me like this was really just a precursor to films like The Human Centipede. There's no real graphic violence (even during the climax of the film) - if you've never seen a horror movie before, then I guess you could be in for a shock, but I think that the real 'horror' of the movie lies in the premise. <br/><br/>Which it goes, I guess. The whole 'abduction and sexual torture' schtick is pretty grim. But that's basically it. They take some teenagers and then spend the rest of the film having increasingly depraved orgies. It's not that deep. Is it a incisive, deep, jarring analysis of the human psyche? Maybe, if it shows that we can think of this stuff. The Marquis de Sade, the real author of this piece, certainly covered it a few hundred years before Pasolini. <br/><br/>Whether Pasolini was murdered over this film, or whether he was murdered for being a far-left homosexual in a neo-fascist Italy, I don't suppose anyone really knows. It seems more like the latter to me, but I could see someone who'd had this film hyped up to them (It is still the most valuable DVD in existence, at $500, which is frankly insane), and then actually watched it to find nothing that anyone said is anything beyond artsy hyperbole. Remember how 'The Exorcist' was 'the most terrifying film ever made'? Remember how it wasn't? Yeah, welcome to Salo.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, there's nothing that shocking about a mass rendition of '2 girls 1 cup' followed by what could have been a screen test for Hostel, which is what this boils down to. Watch this film by all means - it's one of those films that afficionados go on about at great length, but if sexual depravity and death is something you actually want in a film, go rent 'A Serbian Film'. It does it so much better."

But is a bad film anyway.<br/><br/>To be completely honest, I found this movie to be boring. It is true that there were a couple of disgusting and shocking moments, but for most part this film feels flat, having many dull and one-dimensional characters.<br/><br/>In what concerns to movie adaptations of the works of the Marquis de Sade, I think that ""Lunacy"" from Jan Svankmajer was a much more interesting film than this one.<br/><br/>I also think that is a shame that this seems to be most popular film from Pasolini, since he directed much better movies than ""Salò"".<br/><br/>1.5/10"

Watching this film is like being hit with a sledgehammer, having salt rubbed in your wounds, and then finding out that the only way to get the salt out is to have someone wash it out by pissing on you.<br/><br/>This is not a cheap snuff film. It is a work of art. The set pieces and costumes are flawlessly beautiful, which only makes the depraved violence in the film stand out even more. I've seen a lot of posts critical of the acting; I couldn't disagree more--it takes a lot of talent to smile ecstatically (and convincingly) through a long narrative about the most horrible child abuse you can imagine.<br/><br/>So why would someone want to watch a movie that is this punishing? Because evil is a part of the human condition that needs to be acknowledged. In my opinion, watching movies like this doesn't make you desensitized to violence, it makes you hate it even more. Watching a Hollywood action movie where you are supposed to clap every time the perfect hero kills a perfect bad guy desensitizes you to violence. You will not smile when someone in this movie dies to ""get what was coming to them,"" because nobody in this movie could possibly deserve anything that happens to them.<br/><br/>There are two final points I'd like to make. The first is that I've seen a couple of posts where people complain about the gay sex in the movie. If you watch this entire film and THAT is what offends you, you're a twisted person. Even if you are the most homophobic person in the world, there is so much in this movie that should offend you a hundred times more. I'm straight and found that the gay sex is almost a footnote to the other things that are going on. The second is that the similarities between some of these scenes and what happened at Abu Ghraib cannot be dismissed. The fact that this movie could have easily been filmed in Iraq, with real footage, should be a very cautionary point about where we, as a country, are headed."
"TM-2","10","5","11","11 March 2000"," Extremely important masterpiece but often difficult to watch
","Unless you have seen this movie, it may be impossible to understand just how important this movie is from what you may have read. Most reviewers focus in on the unbelievably realistic depictions of torture, rape, humiliation and murder. What makes it even more shocking and ultimately disturbing is that the victims are vulnerable young adolescents and the fact the perpetrators look like regular people. It is extremely hard to get past the horrors presented on the screen. However, this movie shows what happens (and did happen under fascist regimes) when there is no accountability for wrongdoing. The strong prey on the weak. However, the movie suggests that things degenerate beyond preying on the weak to the using, abusing and disposing of them without remorse. Pasolini clearly had very strong, and as history has proven, accurate views on mans inhumanity to man. Nazi Germany provided ample examples covering the full spectrum of atrocities of the weak being disposed of by the strong. Suffice to say that while the movie depicts all kinds of horrors, it does not stray from the reality that history teaches. In fact, to tone down the scenes would actually give a distorted view. Making the unthinkable thinkable. The realism forces the viewer to become repulsed by what is on the screen. Some scenes are almost unwatchable. You are almost forced to the conclusion that this cannot be allowed to happen again. Sadly, I think Pasolini believed that this was the normal state for humans without laws. He might be right.<br/><br/>I watched this movie on DVD. The disc is part of the Criterion Collection and unfortunately no longer in print. The movie was widescreen with English subtitles. Quality was excellent. The movie is well directed and photographed. I got the feeling I was looking at the events unfolding as a voyeur. The actors do not act to the camera. In fact, they seem almost oblivious to the camera. Instead, they act to themselves and the scene giving the strong impression to the viewer that they are not a part of what's going on but are outside observers. <br/><br/>This movie is a very important piece. Unfortunately, the warning it carries will not get a wide audience because of censorship and lack of availability. Also, it may disturb many who do see it. It reminds me of the reaction people have to the horrors filmed in the concentration camps of WWII. It is important for people to see but very hard to watch. Salo is a reminder of what can happen and why vigilance is always necessary.<br/><br/>So if you do get the chance to see the movie, grab it. It is definitely not a family movie or a date movie or any kind of movie really. It is in a class of it's own. Some have written that it is the most depraved, disgusting and distressing movie ever made. One reviewer said it was the only movie he wished he could unsee'.

On the opposite side the left hand side of society, represented by communist party with its two souls (workers and intellectual) was becoming stronger and stronger. In the background of this dispute there was terrorism and the first economical crisis after II world war.<br/><br/>This is definitely a political movie. It shows the horrors of the present society, being a metaphor of the inhumanity of the (political) power. Anarchy against democracy. It is also an intellectual movie, where everything is shown to make the viewer think to something else.<br/><br/>Today, late 1999, movies as this one are almost disappeared, and we movie-addicted, are not anymore used in this kind of experience.<br/><br/>Our society has been becoming more standardised, and all the ""different voices"" are not anymore heard. Today Pasolini is sadly almost forgotten, as other filmmakers of the 70's, and Salò is a ghost-movie in our society. As other masterpieces of the 70's.<br/><br/>We have to fight the lost of memory imposed by our present society, and looking at this horrible, disgusting, shocking masterpiece can be a reaction. We have to start to think again."
"pooch-8","Null","9","24","10 August 1999"," As cinema, Salo is just plain old fecal matter
","When he embarked on what was to be the final film of his career, Pasolini might very well have been attempting to send a message to his native Italians about their complicity with the Nazis during the course of World War II, but his adaptation of the Marquis de Sade's incendiary work of transgression suffers from the cinema's one unforgivable sin: it is deadly dull.  Certainly many viewers will be turned off by the repeated depictions of rape, sodomy, coprophagia, sexual humiliation and torture, but these horrors are treated so casually by the director that the alienated audience is given zero incentive to care a whit about anything transpiring on the screen.  With the exception of a very miniscule treatment of two young girls who support one another when one of the pair cries that she cannot go on, Pasolini exerts no effort to create sympathy for the enslaved children. What is undoubtedly meant as a commentary on the ""banality of evil"" comes out in the wash as just a banal film."
"danbarrios-15189","8","2","3","29 November 2019"," Humanity in Salò
","Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial film is well known for its graphic content, especially since some call it sadistic  or something along the lines of that. However, though graphic, the content in the film serves a purpose. This film is VERY anti fascist and is full of political themes that are still relevant in a contemporary aspect. The libertines constantly bring up the idea that evil is contagious and will prevail over the hope of the victims, but they fail to recognize that the humanity of the victims still prevails throughout the course of the film. They can degrade, violate, torture, and manipulate them but at the end of the day, they still have one thing to hold on to. This can be seen through the final scene with the two boys slow dancing with one another. They endured the 120 days but still have a bit of light within them. They closed the drapes instead of partaking in watching the violent deaths of the others, acting in defiance to the joy of  Libertines and all was well for them because of that. What I found interesting about the film is that it places the audience within the viewpoint of the Libertines, shaming us for wanting to see the unspeakable acts committed against the victims. This is done by showing the beginning and end of an act, never the direct act itself. It becomes much clearer in the final chapter once the Libertines take turns watching the victims be killed through binoculars which is done through multiple POV shots, directly placing us in their view and cutting away to their evil laughter or sexual arousal. Overall, the film is not for everyone. It is NC-17 so be wary of that. I do believe it is a film that should be seen, but not everyone should see it."

"Angelika_New_York","9","2","3","23 April 2017"," Well, here we go.
","Hey there! Guess what?! <br/><br/>You're not going to believe that I have actually watched this film. I have not heard of it until late 2010 when it had been recommended to me here on IMDb because of my interest in Gaspar Noe's Irreversible. I really am into film, however I would like to state that I would never, ever watch Cannibal Holocaust, really. No thanks. Supposedly there are similarities, but I must say that this is about as far as I am likely to go in regards to watching a disturbing film.<br/><br/>Initially I was ignoring the recommendation. I disregarded it as being some obscure film that had come out in the 70's. I had never heard of Pier Paolo Pasolini. I am not going into his demise as you probably have your theories. Besides this is basically a film review.<br/><br/>Let me tell you: for a long time I felt I just was not ready to watch this; unsure if I ever would be. The reason being is that after everything I have read about it, (which you probably should do also, if you are seriously thinking about watching this) I was hesitant that I could really sit through it. My main concern was that it could be too graphic considering the subject matter. On and off I have contemplated it for three years. Yes, three years wondering whether or not to watch a movie! By the final year, I have thought about it more and more. So you want to know how I watched this? From Netflix. And you want to know something else? I watched ita couple of timesin like six weeks maybe. That was it really. I just wanted to watch it a second time to get a little more familiar with it from the first time. <br/><br/>Actually speaking of the first time; afterwards like the next day, I remember actually feeling a bit queasy from even thinking about what I had watched. Since I recoiled during the explicit scenes, it was a brief feeling of mental disturbance. I wouldn't say I was absolutely ready for my first viewing, although I was as ready as I ever could have been, I was a little more composed on the second viewing. I still could not watch the really graphic parts.<br/><br/>It doesn't take either side of right or wrong. It is not a dramatic film. It isn't really all that violent either, not by horror movie standards. The DVD/Blu-Ray cover showing the side of a long blonde haired naked girl on her knees with her face in her hands is misleading. There is not a scene in the film that shows that. I was expecting something like the scene showing Marilyn Burns freaking out with her hands tied to a chair at the one end of a dining table towards the ending of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) but there wasn't a scene that was like that, although there are moments in the film where I had to look away, such as: A scene when one nude victim wearing only a dog collar is fed a piece of cake with small razor blades in it.<br/><br/>In addition, a young woman is forced to eat human feces, the seven minute scene where everybody eats human feces at a dinner event, some are smiling and loving it while others are disgusted. The ending when a young man's tongue is cut off and a young person's eye is cut out with a knife.It is a rather talky film. I remember thinking after I made it up to the 42:00 mark that it really was not all that bad.It is best to research the film before viewing it. The homosexuality aspect of it makes it interesting. What made it even more compelling is that I found myself attracted to Paolo Bonacelli, even although he plays one of the fascist libertines."
"Polaris_DiB","6","2","3","7 July 2009"," Mixed feelings about a strong statement
","First of all, this movie has more plot and more skillful development than most people tend to talk about, because most people tend to be struck by its hardest parts--which is the point. It's important when taking on a work like this that the intent isn't just to shock, but to shock for a reason, and that reason has to be backed up by a structural logic that Pasolini was obviously aware of.<br/><br/>I didn't like it, but not because of how disturbing it was. I just think that fascists did enough real life evil that we hardly have use for such over-the-top ""allegories"", as it were. On the other hand, if absolute power corrupts absolutely, it is interesting to see someone pointing out how that extends to joyless sexual deviency as well. So my feelings are mixed.<br/><br/>I'm a general fan of what some call ""abject art"" (a term I rather like and find very appropriate), which seeks to engage or compel an audience's negative reactions instead of positive ones. In the case of Salo, you are supposed to feel revulsion, not just intellectually, but physically, so that fascism and other forms of absolutist power is met in the audience with visceral revulsion, A Clockwork Orange style. Only nobody is holding your eyes open and there are no chemicals involved (unless you were the one to take them, at which case you've probably lost your mind by now and wouldn't be reading this), so in order to operate, Pasolini has to keep your attention and trigger your attention. I feel he successfully managed that for the most part, though to be perfectly honest, all those storytelling moments began to run into each other and drag.<br/><br/>I also don't feel like all parts of the allegory were well developed. I understand that he intended for the cropophagia, for instance, to refer to fast food industries, but there was no other evidence that would lead to that association within the text--we have to turn to what Pasolini himself said about the movie in order to understand it, and that's not good film-making.<br/><br/>Overall, the best aspect of it all told is the fact that somebody actually took a Marquis de Sade work and turned it into something just as loaded, just as controversial, and just as tasteless, unlike other de Sade adaptations (like Quills, which shows his life and parts of his work, but only the fun parts; or Lunacy, which mixes it with Edgar Allen Poe and Svankmajer's usual Gothic hilarity, making it all just fun absurdism and neglecting some of the straighter-faced harder-to-swallow bits).<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","Although this film was banned in the u.k. for many years, I recently saw it uncut on t.v.<br/><br/>Prior to the film being shown there was a documentary where many people argued that this was a powerful piece of art, as have many people on this site.<br/><br/>However after watching it I felt numb and cheated that I had wasted two hours of my life watching Pasolini's ""classic"".<br/><br/>The plot is very simple - towards the end of World War II several powerful Italian fascists take prisoner a group of young men and women and torture them, whilst some old prostitutes tell ever more disgusting stories, and err....thats it.<br/><br/>Apparently there is some great anti fascist message in showing young (suprisingly compliant) people being tortured; physically,sexually and mentally. That seems to me to be using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, everyone knows that fascism is disgusting and that terrible atrocities were commited during World War II, but does that mean to make a voyeuristic movie depicting it is an intelligent thing to do? Especially when it's combined with the sick jail cell fantasies of the Marquis de Sade, and not paticularly well made. The acting is generally poor, and that is combined with some pretty bad camerawork and phoney torture effects. Also it might be set in the '40s but everyone has '70s haircuts!<br/><br/>It seems to me that if this movie had been made by an American director then it would still be banned in the U.K., but slap some subtitles on it and you have a deep art house masterpiece.<br/><br/>The only reason to see it is that unlike a lot of other previously banned movies that are not that disturbing (for example The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), this film has many genuinely unsettling scenes.<br/><br/>I believe that it is right that this movie isn't banned anymore in Britain, but it's difficult to see where it's merits (arstistic or cinematic) lie."

It was a very disturbing movie (and disturbing novel!), and I deeply think pedophilia is WRONG, but in a strange way, the movie and book were also very power, so powerful that even in some places in the world, it was banned.<br/><br/>
I usually not easily grossed out or frightened, and I am a fan of most of Pausolini's works in cinema, but even `120 Days of Sodom' gave me nightmares for days!

","Many serious movie watchers seem to regard Pasolini's 'Salo' a masterpiece, which is, in my view, an overstatement to say the least. Sure, 'Salo' is a unique film, and it obviously qualifies as ""art"" (as opposed to some other plotless depictations of sadistic torture that have really been made for the enjoyment of disturbed individuals). However, the fact that 'Salo' treats its subject in a somewhat more mature manner than sadistic horror movies does not make it a masterpiece; it does not even make it good.<br/><br/>'Salo' contains some great visuals, but apart from that, it's really bad. Actually, I'm reminded of Jörg Buttgereit's 'Nekromantik'. Both are attempts to make an ""art"" movie on a repulsive subject, and both fail in the same way: apart from being ""exceptional"" in daring to show people unspeakable things they would prefer not to see, they are truly hollow inside. This film could have been a remarkable study on the darkest aspects of humanity, and on the decline and destruction of moral under the right social and political circumstances. But there just seems to be nothing really intelligent under the surface.<br/><br/>It takes more to make a masterpiece than to choose a repulsive subject and rub it in people's faces. I recommend this only to die-hard art movie watchers as perfect example of bad art."

","This movie is, at the very least, difficult to classify or judge. It is signed by one of the most controversial Italian filmmakers, Pier Paolo Pasolini, a man whose life was brutally marked by World War II, in which he lost his brother, killed in action. The fact that the film focuses on this period and have the Italian fascists as villains seems to me a form of political statement, as if the filmmaker were trying to use the film to express rage over the war and his hatred of the Italian fascists. This becomes more logical if we consider that Pasolini was also a Communist who was only expelled from the party after being, allegedly, caught up having sex with a minor boy in public, which makes him not only a homosexual but also a pederast and, perhaps, an exhibitionist. So, Pasolini wasn't a sympathetic and conventional figure that everyone liked, and the same thing happens with this film, almost as controversial and brutal as its creator, in that it joins Pasolini and the infamous Marquis de Sade, author of the original novel that gave base to the plot.<br/><br/>The plot is simple: the Fascists imprison dozens of young Italians for a session of torture and permanent humiliation that will last about 120 days. There are about an hour of eschatological or pornographic scenes which, I believe, will have many kinds of metaphorical or symbolic explanation in the eyes of today's amorphous pseudo-intellectuals. But for me a pile of feces is a pile of feces, not an allegory for the pains of society, or capitalism, or anything else. That's an ill-smelling explanation for shocking scenes which I'm unwilling to swallow, however much the experts, full of their natural arrogance, may look at me with disdain. No. Even art has to know reasonable limits. To make matters worse, the film is depressing, it is deeply negative about almost everything.<br/><br/>If there is any technical and artistic competence in this film is something I have not yet fully evaluated, but I am willing to give Pasolini the benefit of the doubt at that particular point. The fact is that, even if there is art here, the overall of the movie turns out to be so bad, so depressing, manic and disturbing that it's not really worth the effort to watch it."

First of all, I'm generally squeamish about onscreen violence in lousy movies - for example, I cover my eyes and mutter ""never again..."" during graceless Jerry Bruckheimer action films, where the goal seems to be a ""pornographic"" display of bodies being blown apart, with total, close-up visibility.<br/><br/>This is not a lousy movie, and I didn't find it all that disturbing. First of all, the stuff that happens isn't THAT extreme, compared to most average slasher or action flicks.<br/><br/>Secondly, the brutality isn't trivialized like in most movies, nor is it made to serve some ""metaphoric"" purpose (or so I feel, despite other IMDb reviewers' well-expressed opinions). Also, despite what others here claim, the movie doesn't seem designed merely to ""show how horrible"" brutality, dehumanization, and torture are. Everyone (functioning normally in society) knows that already - no one needs a graphic, disturbing movie to tell them so.<br/><br/>Instead, this movie is doing something all its own, something I won't attempt to analyze here. I will say that it may help to have read a little Sade and his critical reception (this is one of the few movies with a ""reading list"" at the beginning). Pierre Klossowski's reading of Sade (in ""Sade My Neighbor"") is more or less directly paraphrased in the film. Sade himself, by the way, is *truly* disturbing - the book ""120 Days of Sodom"" describes rape and murder (and countless extreme acts) in a matter-of-fact, clinical way, and I could barely handle even the first section.<br/><br/>Unlike the book  - and, again, despite what others on IMDb are mystifyingly saying - this movie *does* portray the libertines' captives as suffering individuals. They're in a state of zombie-like terror most of the time, but they do suffer, cry, scream, and ""resist"" (though only by ""informing"" on each other; a nice touch, as the movie illustrates how they have become cogs in the fascist machinery). Although the libertines feel no empathy for the victims they dehumanize, the viewer certainly does (or at least, I did).<br/><br/>Hard as it may be to believe, ""Salo"" does what it does in a ""tasteful"" way. It's definitely not for everyone, but unlike movies available at every Blockbuster that seem to *glorify* the rape, murder, and violence they depict, this film is doing something altogether different and very unique.<br/><br/>(I do love action movies and horror flicks, by the way - I'm no prude - as long as they're done *well*, and are clever and self-aware about what they're doing. ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,"" yes; ""I Spit on Your Grave,"" noooo.)"

","Something many may not know about this film - it is based on the book of the same name which was written by French writer Marquis de Sade and published in 1910, but written in 1785. The book is MUCH worse than the movie from what I gather (I read the book but have not watched the movie due to the highly graphic nature of the book). I've read the synopsis of what the movie contains and I can gather that they left out a huge portion of things, for a good reason. Had the producers of this film made it 100% accurate to the book, they probably would have been arrested child pornography, torture, etc.<br/><br/>So for those of you coming here to rate the movie after the fact in a rage about the producers/actors/writers of the movie - this was taken from an already written text by someone who had to be a sadist centuries ago. Don't bash the movie crew for something someone else wrote in the 1700's. Yes, they still made it into a movie which they maaaaybe shouldn't have. But at least they didn't think it up themselves.<br/><br/>For those coming here to look at reviews to see if they want to watch this movie, here's my suggestion - READ THE BOOK! While it is considerably more graphic, at least you aren't subjecting your eyeballs to actual pictures of this stuff, and you'll gain a better understanding of the movie if you so wish to still watch it afterwards."
"ironhorse_iv","5","3","6","21 August 2014"," This is one of the most controversial, perverted, and disgusting movie on the face of the planet. It's smart but way too disturbing.
","Honestly, how did this movie get made and got Criterion Blu-Ray release will forever be a mystery for me? Although, this movie remains a controversial film, it has been praised by various film historians and critics for reasons that I do have to agree upon, for the most part. Don't get me wrong, the movie is very intelligent well shot movie, the dialogue pretty clever, but in the end, Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom is notorious unpleasant to watch, even for an art house film. There is little to no joy to this film. Some people feel that the film is nothing more than extreme exploitation that bordering pedophile. Others think, it's a legitimate piece of art and satire regarding fascism. In my opinion, watching it, it's a little of both. Based on the book, 'The 120 Days of Sodom', by the infamous 18th century author Marquis de Sade, the movie directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini, can be describe as torture porn. The story is in four segments, inspired by Dante's Inferno: the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Sh*t and the Circle of Blood. It focus on four wealthy, corrupt fascist libertines, the Duke (Paolo Bonacelli), the Bishop (Giorgio Cataldi), the Magistrate (Umberto P. Quintavalle) and the President (Aldo Valletti), whom in 1943, kidnap a group of teens, both boys and girls and subject them to four months of extreme violence, sadism, and sexual and mental torture. There is little to no arch in the film, as the victims are just pain taken blandly slaughter without any sense of hope or who they really are. No fight back, no escape, no anything. I found this to be a bit too much for certain audience members to take as there is little to no attachment to these characters. The acting from them are pretty alright. The four prostitutes have the most exposition told about them, but lacks character development. For the most part, they play little to no part of the film, besides telling stories. I'm surprises the villains didn't take advance of them, even more. The villains could be describe as over the top sadists even for Benito Mussolini's Fascist Italy. The acting is chilling, but goofy at times. It really get tiresome, when the villains don't get what coming for them. I can only hope, off-scene that they did. After all, in the end, even the villains can't escape death. One might say, that the movie is about life, trying to survive under the harsh reality of sex, violence, and mania. Indeed, the infamous scene where the characters eat their excretions can be a metaphor for how people are willing take the pain that comes with life. The coprophilic scenes based on director Pasolini to be an insult to the fast-food industry for feeding people, horrible food. In my opinion, I think he's saying more than that. The film is noted for exploring the themes of political corruption, abuse of power, sadism, perversion, sexuality and fascism. Still, the message of the film isn't very clear. The film also contains frequent references to and several discussions of Friedrich Nietzsche's 1887 book Zur Genealogie der Moral: Eine Streitschrift, Ezra Pound's poem The Cantos, and Marcel Proust's novel In Search of Lost Time. Being based off 'Marquis de Sade', there was no surprised what the film was going to be about, as there are just countless scenes depicting intensely graphic nudity with violence, sadism and sexual depravity. Still, the movie doesn't go as dark, as the book, which contains scenes of mutilation, necrophilia, and cannibalism described in the source material. The movie pacing is a bit slow. It's get interrupted way too much, with the random time-outs. There are four alternative endings; one with a red flag, one with the cast and crew dancing a wild dance, another with the four gentlemen talking their conclusions on their sexual experience, and last is the one that was used, with the two soldiers dancing. The movie is still hard to find. There is certain DVDS that update everything. The audio presented a very weak in older copies. The Criterion version clean it up very well. Mono track sounds excellent, and you can listen to it, both with English dubbing or Italian with English sub-titles. Still, the dialogue appears to have been re-recorded post-production so the lip movements don't always seem to match what is being said. The opening score by Ennio Morricone is still haunting, even today. The film was extremely controversial upon its release, and remains banned in several countries. Even the director Pasolini was murdered in still-mysterious circumstances shortly after completing the film. Who knows, if it's related to what happen in the film or not. While not typically considered a horror film, it's one of the most disturbing films, I ever saw. This movie made me vomit. It took me, a few days to get through this film. . Still, why watch a movie like this, when you hear nightmare news like this in real life? The reasons why I saw the film, was to challenge myself, into understanding what drives certain people to do horrible stuff like this. Once in the while, humans have to dip their hand in the dark side, to find the good out of life and find a way to stop things like this from happening. That's the reason, why. If anybody watch this, to find enjoyment. Please, serious help, right away. Overall: Not a good movie at all. I don't recommended it."
"Chriss-m","10","3","6","8 April 2014"," This is not torture porn, and here's why:
","'Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom' is based on the morally repugnant novel of the same name by the notorious 18th-century French writer The Marquis de Sade. Since the film's release in 1975 it has attracted the scorn<br/><br/>the critics. In 1977, Vincent Canby of The New York Times attacked the very raison d'être of the film; he refused to accept the justifications for the movie's lurid scenes, harshly scolding Pasolini in an ad hominem attack: ""For all of Mr. Pasolini's desire to make ""Salo"" an abstract statement, one cannot look at images of people being scalped, whipped, gouged, slashed, covered with excrement and sometimes eating it and react abstractedly unless one shares the director's obsessions."" <br/><br/>And it is true. Salo is a grim film, impossibly difficult to watch. Even writing about the film is enough to fill me with that same sense of disgust and dread that it provoked when I first viewed it. I've seen films that reach every extreme, films much more explicitly graphic than this, but it is Salo that still lurks in my subconscious, that still haunts my mind with the grieving, hopeless cries of the victims trapped in it. But is this the work of a fetishist? Is the legacy of Salo simply the advent of torture porn?<br/><br/>I choose to believe that Pasolini wasn't a mere provocateur, but an observer of the human condition. An artist with a point to communicate, even if that requires corroding away our filter, our ability to detach from the screen, by his use of gruesome and vile imagery. <br/><br/>Salo is a modern adaptation of de Sade's chronicle of tortures which is transposed from 18th-century France to the backdrop of Mussolini's fascist Italy, in 1944. The grim story begins in a small town, where the army is rounding up a group of young teenagers. The children are taken to a castle, inhabited by four of the corrupt elite: The Duke, The Magistrate, The Bishop, and The President. Soon it becomes clear that these four are sadistic libertines, who intend to use the children as sexual objects, on which they can unleash any and every desire they possess. In order to inspire their libidos, the four also invited some seasoned and experienced prostitutes, each with her own horrible speciality. <br/><br/>It is clear without much analysis that Salo is showing the horrors of Fascism: the unbridled ruling class using their power to commit unspeakable atrocities, discarding every moral law that gives us any sense of being human. Even the harshest critics of the film seem to accept this. The problem tends to be that such horrific imagery isn't necessary to communicate such a simplistic message; that 'fascism is bad' is indeed a redundant message, which needs no explanation because the world has already witnessed its horrors. And that may be so. We have all seen the documentaries and read the textbooks, but documentaries and textbooks show the events in a cold and educational context. Pasolini lived under Mussolini's fascist regime; he experienced Fascism first hand. As Salo does so terribly well - the film reeks of despair throughout. Perhaps that is what makes Salo so hard to watch. The constant, impending doom. The viewer never expects the cavalry to arrive, or a white knight to ride in and save the day. As is with Fascism, 'Abandon hope, all ye who enter here'. <br/><br/>It is established as soon as the libertines have their way that the children are no more than objects. Possessions. In the 'Ante-inferno', the children are reduced to how attractive they are and treated like animals. They are no longer allowed individuality or personality. They are being broken. It can be argued that Pasolini uses this to portray the dehumanising effect of Capitalism. As a staunch communist, Pasolini believed Capitalism strips us of our essence. That sexuality has become a commodity. That we are objectified. Some believe that the film's portrayal of sexuality as painful, debauched and degrading signifies how Pasolini sees Capitalism's effect on the person; that the commercialisation of sex has, in effect, killed it. This is made particularly clear when the libertines examine the children for any physical flaws, willing to dispose of those they find unappealing. This almost anti-erotic, clinical portrayal of sex, I believe, defies those critics' view that the film is somehow a cathartic, sexual release for Pasolini. The film is void of any sort of attempt to arouse. The camera doesn't linger on the children, the actors aren't directed to seduce.<br/><br/>De Sade was contentious. And this is what Pasolini and he truly have in common. They parallel in misinterpretation. There are loads of different interpretations of Salo and 120 Days..., many of them driven by ignorance, or stilted by repulsion, or just mistaken. But even the analyses that aren't hysterical, the few analysts that retain a logical and coherent line of argument, they can still differ to extremes in what they believe the primary message is. All art is forever contentious, as it should be. And this is my preemptive defence of Salo. The fact that it can be so hotly debated by scholars, whom can maintain logical arguments but still disagree vehemently isn't a weakness of the film, but a strength. All art has an observation of the human condition to make, and Salo is no different. And maybe this is why the film is now respected as a valuable film, with avid supporters such as German director Michael Haneke and even film critic Roger Ebert."
"thomvic","8","3","6","18 April 2011"," A shocking film that might leave some wondering why they sat through it....
","This is not a film you want to ever watch again after the first viewing. The only reason I watched this film was because it was in the '1001 movies you must see before you die' book and I'm trying to see as much of the films it recommends. So after doing some research on this film and hearing people's disgust and horror, but also the film's themes and message, I was very curious to see it. I don't mind being challenged by cinema.<br/><br/>And while watching it - this is not a film that will entertain you but more disgust you. The story is simply a horrible fascism power narrative that degrades kidnapped males and females prisoners into doing all sort of sexual degrading acts while also putting them through torture in the end for crimes of wrongdoing. The film is set in the Republic of Salò, Italy in 1944.One particular part has people eating human feces. I read this is meant to be a metaphor of consumer capitalism and the consumption of junk food in our lives. Well McDonalds still gives me some sort of pleasure when I eat it.<br/><br/>The heroes of this film are supposedly the captors - the leaders of this horrible prison. And it makes sense because this film tries to expose fascism for what it is and if they only showed this amount on film, I can only imagine what it was actually like in reality. This can happen in all sorts of situations where you have lunatics hungry for power and complete control. So there is a strong message here that I can understand what Pasolini is trying to say here. He was impacted emotionally by such parties back in World War 2 and he is simply trying to show how abuse of power and control only serves those few who have it, while everyone who is 'ordinary people' are considered as not worthy of being treated as gods, but animals.<br/><br/>As for the sexual acts that go on, they are degrading for these people so only someone who has pleasure in sadistic acts and enjoys this could derive any sort of pleasure in such viewings. <br/><br/>I don't intend to watch this film again and I can't imagine why anyone should want to do so out of pleasure. This is one of those films, such as Hanake's 'Funny Games' that a single viewing is enough to understand the message. To put yourself through it more than once is simply asking for yourself to have a bad feeling in you and as humans, we can only be reminded so much of the cruelties in life.<br/><br/>While many will be quick to dismiss this as a horrible piece of work, I think it has a lot to say on the human condition, power and control and the abuse of it.<br/><br/>But be warned viewers - this is not a film that you can take in lightly. Be prepared for what you are seeing if you see this and make sure you want to see a film such as this. It most certainly isn't for everyone. This is a film to be viewed on artistic purposes and meaning. If you're looking for a good time or entertainment, this is an instant fail."

","This film got me thinking about evolution and how it always ends up favoring monsters. After all, human monsters kill all the good guys and then go on to have children. Read the Bible. Jews massacre race after race and keep all the virgins to breed with. What do you get? Us! (Nothing against Jews, its just that that Bible is familiar). This film reaches down into your gut and forces you to confront some terrible realities. We all know war criminals with cushy jobs at Universities (Rumsfield). We all watch the news and Internet to see what bad soldiers do with their free time. Religions are forever torturing and murdering women to appease or rationalize some primitive urge. Right wing bigots tear up the airwaves urging people to hate gays, immigrants and anyone with a sense of fairness. We are outraged when foreigners celebrate the murder of our soldiers but we congratulate ourselves for bombing entire countries back to the stone age. The 120 Days of Sodom is all around us all the time. It takes a film like this to force us to see it. The film makes an excellent point of what lurks underneath power. If you watch this film and then go back to your life with the blinders on - well I guess that is the point of the whole film. If the film didn't reach you, you are the unseen force in the film and gives license to the evil perverts shown therein. This film is a terrible but highly accurate vision of the dilemma we are born into. If you don't see yourself or our society in the monsters of this film I think you missed the point."

","Time and time again, Salo is always on people's Most Disturbing movies list. Finally I took the time out to get a hold of this flick and I can now see why people think this way.<br/><br/>Salo is about a bunch of rich, smary and ultra-mega perverse and ultimately evil fascist weirdos who kidnap a bunch of young lovelies, male and female. Their sole goal, to completely fulfill their bizarre sexual fantasies. No spoiler here, they get their wish.<br/><br/>Salo surprisingly to me, was a pretty well-made flick. It had (what-seemed to me) a size-able budget, good over-the-top acting, a unique setting, and overall it had a unsettling feeling over the entire film. Which I'm sure the huge, mansion situated in the (what seems) isolated country-side managed to help with this feeling.<br/><br/>But unfortunately, the film was pretty tedious. At first I was pretty into the movie. I didn't know what was going on, and I kinda had hope for the young lovelies. The Fascist pervs were all uniquely bizarre and all had their own sick personality. But at the same time almost whenever they spoke it was some bullcrap philosophical blabbering that drove me to start thinking about when would they show nudity again. Though, some of the lines they delivered were thought-provoking and kinda funny. ""Nothing's worse than a breath without odor."" Haha, yeah, okay.<br/><br/>Also, Evol666 warned me that the Old Prostitutes would be boring. I didn't want to believe him since I thought that had a lot of potential. At first it was alright, but ultimately like almost everything else this movie delivers began to bore and grow tiresome.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, for a good amount of the movie I was entertained. By the ridiculously high sexual content and the oodles of boobs and bums, to the overall absurdity of the story, I was enjoying it. But like I said, the movie begins to wear down the viewer and it ends up only being a flick to watch for the extreme factor. Which actually was the only reason I sought out this film."

"ItalianGerry","Null","3","6","5 June 2004"," Disquieting masterwork from Italy.
","(This is a transcription of a review of Salò I wrote when it was first shown in the United States in 1977. Some spoilers included.)<br/><br/>The late Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial final film ""Salò or the 120 Days of Sodom"" received its belated premiere at the New York Film Festival last week and has since opened commercially in that city.<br/><br/>Based on the Marquis de Sade's 18th Century novel, ""120 Days of Sodom."" The film transposes the setting to Salò, the Nazi-Fascist northern Italian puppet republic of Mussolini during the Badoglio armistice in the south, after Mussolini had been freed by German paratroopers but before the partisans caught and executed him. Salò is located on the western end of Lake Garda.<br/><br/>Because of the unrelenting treatment of its subject, Salò has a way of turning off and making uneasy whole segments of any audience. There were numerous walkouts at the festival screening. The movie graphically presents horrors such as eye-gouging, a tongue-cutting, a scalping, necrophilia, as well as scenes of sodomy. And there are those by now infamous and understandably repulsive scenes of coprophagia, the eating of human feces.<br/><br/>It must be said that Pasolini's film does not revel in these actions, graphic as they are, for the mere sake of titillation. ""Salò"" is a far cry from cheap gross-out movies of the drive-in variety as you are likely to get. Nor is it especially erotic despite extensive nudity and simulated couplings. It is meant to depict the essence of the evil of Fascism as a cheapening of human worth and a debasing merchandising of people's flesh and souls.<br/><br/>""Salò"" is ""terrible"" but only in the Latin sense of ""terribilis"" or ""terrifying."" It is a grim metaphor for the totalitarian state. The action of the movie is parallel to that of the book. Four representatives of authority (a president, a bishop, a judge, and a magistrate) prepare a group of 16 virginal boys and girls (kidnapped from their rural homes) for a bleak orgy of degradation and eventual physical and spiritual death by tortures that are to be inflicted upon them by the end of the film. <br/><br/>Armed soldiers prevent their exit. The events take place in a Renaissance villa and are divided into a series of tableaux, each with a title like ""Girone della Merda"" and ""Girone del Sangue"" (Circle of Excrement and Circle of Blood,) suggesting a Dante-esque Inferno but deprived of Dante's guiding moral force and replaced by a melancholy nihilism, as cynical as it is sinister.<br/><br/>Introducing each of the excursions into debauchery and sadism are several parlor episodes in which a number of ""madams"" attempt to arouse the four depraved hosts through erotic stories accompanied by piano music. One of the women is the still-lovely Caterina Boratto, a famous 1930s leading lady who also had a cameo appearance in Fellini's ""8 ½."" Most of the other performers in the movie are relatively unknown.<br/><br/>When I staggered out of this film in search of a martini, feeling queasy and slightly overwhelmed, I felt I had been through hell. I felt also that I had seen a masterpiece, but I wasn't sure why I thought the film was great. If artistry can be measured in kilowatts of intensity, then this movie is doubtlessly greata bleak ""terrible"" vision not easy to assimilate but one whose clarity and power command respect."

","Just a thought, but if I'm going to denounce fascism, I don't think the first text I'd adapt to force that point home would be something written by the Marquis De Sade. The man literally wrote his sickest sexual fantasies in his own feces--what about those stories is inherently political? Nothing at all. I'm sure you can look back on it and twist the meanings and subtexts into whatever you want to make them when dealing with a canvas as muddled and splattered as this one is, sort of like a cinematic rorschach test--except even that description is giving too much philosophical credit to a movie which is pretty obviously one directors deviant wet dreams finally realized on film.<br/><br/>There is no anti-facist message here, there is no commentary on the numbness of the soul. It's not inherent in the source, and is not brought out by the filmmaker. there's a lot of really sick sex acts and a lot of grisly torture scenes. What's the point of all this? Ostensibly, it's to decry facism. Okay--but then why take a story written by a known psychotic deviant from the 1790's and move it to world war II? Why not write your own story that actually deals with the problems you're trying to rail against?<br/><br/>
The reasoning people are using to excuse this movie's existence just makes no sense. It reeks of the kind of ""radical"" thinking that enabled the director of ""I Spit on Your Grave"" to change the title to ""Day of the Woman"" and claim it's a feminist manifesto. At least that guy had the presence of mind to actually make his movie about women revenging themselves on men. There is no connection between the source material and the movie the director said he wanted to make. None. Zero.<br/><br/>All the comments to the contrary in this review section just reinforce my belief that people will believe what they want to believe and that you can snowjob anyone if you just lie creatively enough. This movie isn't making any profound statement on the evils of facism, this movie is just a parade of nastiness that deserves no excuse, much like it's brothers in tastelessness, Caligula and I Spit on your Grave."

I have tried to read De Sade's novel which inspired this movie ('The 120 Days Of Sodom') and found it to be much the same thing - repellent, highly repetitive, and completely dull. A difficult read for several reasons. So you could say that Pasolini has managed to be very faithful to the book in that sense. This is ultimately a very boring movie, and most people will find it a chore to finish. How do you rate a movie like this? How can you judge whether it was successful or not when you can't tell exactly what it was trying to achieve? I have no answers. 'Salo' is at the very least a unique movie experience. Ban it?

And was it me or did some actors seem to be younger then the age o 18 ?, only the idea makes me sick, and I am very curious who persuaded the actors to join making this movie. Raitng one is too much for this blatant display. Imho this film should be banned."

","This is one of the films that will never go away. No matter how much you would choose to ignore it, it will still be there, as a looming presence.<br/><br/>Pasolini made a film that goes beyond borders of what most people want to see; it covers the darkest parts of the human mind and puts it to the screen, elaborating it so truly and disgustingly that it has been banned for years past and possible years to come.<br/><br/>If you are one of those hardballs, who have seen Cannibal Holocaust, Guinea Pig and those alike, and you put this on, expecting a gore party unlike anything you could ever dream of, you will be very disappointed. But if you put this on, dedicating your entire mind to whats goes on at the screen, and forgetting that people told you how ""sick"" this movie is, your will experience that this is the darkest and most controversial piece of motion picture ever made in human history.<br/><br/>A masterpiece."

","Salo was banned in Finland until recently. I have read that it was close to passing the strict censorship at the time of its making due to its cinematic merit.

"childrenwithknives","Null","4","10","26 April 2003"," Disturbing? Hardly
","If you have never seen Pasolini's 'Salo:The 120 day's of sodom' and after reading all of the reviews of this film you still feel confused about this film and have some doubt as to the validity of the reviews you have read here, for what might amount to many reasons, I have applied a no-nonsense approach to reviewing this film that will simplify and in the easiest terms to understand, clarify the truth concerning  all of the controversy over this film. I won't waste anymore time in presenting the storyline or what there is of a storyline in this film. For that you can simply read some of the other reviews herein. If you are a hardcore gore hound looking for something even more horrific and frightening considering the premise that the vast number of these reviews has layed out, promising the most repulsive and sadistic things imaginable are presented in this film. Or you as all of us are are seeking out the forbidden fruit and are hopeful that you will have the shock of your life, you will more than likely walk away from this film dissapointed. many of the reveiws I have read on the subject of Salo lead the reader to believe that this is the most horrendous display of gratuitous sickness that has ever been committed or displayed to a film. The fact is that this is misleading in a big way. Let me put it simply... If you have seen 'Caligula','Cannibal holocaust','Nekromantik', or 'Eraserhead', you will proabably be greatly dissapointed in this movie for it's so called ""shock value"". 'Cannibal holocaust' disturbed me allot when I saw it. It's brutality and inhumanity was staggering to me. I was never to even come close to being effected that way by seeing Salo. This is partly because the film fails to provide the atmospheric edge and mood that might convey a sense of hopelessness and doom that was very real and present in 'Cannibal holocaust' provided mostly by a very well executed music track that accompanied the film, and by the gruesome depictions of actual animal killings. 'Caligula' was far more shocking due to the fact that actual gratuitous sex acts were being inacted all around world renown actors such as Peter O'Toole and Malcom McDowell as they presented thier characters with such depth and perciseness. It is a real shock even now to think that such renowned performers would allow themselves so freely into the world of real pornography. 'Caligula' is filled with real sex acts including Homosexual oral sex, water sports, and even fisting. In truth 'Caligual' was a masterwork of artistic creativity in film making plunged head first into the very real world of porn. It was the very first film to truly cross definitive boundries of decency and morality, and the result left audiences then and now equally repulsed. Salo on the other hand attempts to do the same perhaps with less than believable results. The sex acts are no more revieling than the average 'R' rated film of today. The violence is weakly shot and unconvincing, especially the infamous ""eye gouging"" scene. If you look closely the eye pops out even before the knife makes contact with it. The tongue that is torn out (shown on the cover of the dvd) looks like a piece of sponge, and the consumption of feces in the ""circle of shit"" segment is shot at a distance and very short. it is also no more nausiating than watching someone throw up or a baby who finger paints himself with his poop. But Salo does succeed on a couple of other levels. As a tale of the level of perversity that man is capable of, it is a sobering reminder of what mankind can, has, and will do, and that morality is one our most important attributes that we must somehow hold fast to. morality has become all but lost as we subject ourselves to the constant bombardment of depictions of depravity, violence, and inhumanity in films and television. Salo is a warning of what men are capable of in the worst of all situations. The movie is masterfully shot, the art direction is good, and the camera work deserves merit. The acting is excellent for the most part as well. 'The Exorcist', Andy Warhol's 'Frankenstein','Night of the living dead' and even films like Brian de palma's 'Sisters' had the abiltiy to truly shock audiences through the combination of direction, music, camera work, lighting, ect. to truly shock. The elements of those films worked well in their time. Salo has none of those elements, though it would have us believe it does. However I disagree with many in their insistance that the film holds no clear messege or point of questioning our own morality. by whatever level we are repulsed or not by this movie, Pasolini in my opinion made the point loud and clear. 'Salo:The 120 day's of sodom' is a sobering reminder of what we have and are slowly becoming as human beings. But I cannot recommend this movie. Though I feel it isn't trash all together, it remains ultimately- boring, silly, laughable, and maybe a bit twisted and depraved if you allow to be so. Save yourself the time and money and pass on this one."
"cristasol","10","4","10","6 November 2002"," It is not an anti-fascism film
","First: Excuse my poor English!<br/><br/>Second: I think the film is not an anti-nazi or anti-fascism film. The film goes beyond a concrete country or historic moment. The film is about human evil. The presence of Nietsche or Sade is very more important than fascist ideology. There is not a moment in the film that the four fascists tell in defense of fascism. In other wise, they say some things like jokes about it. They don´t believe in anything. The fascism is only a way to get the power. They are a judge, a politician, a bishop and a duke. Nobody of this people believe in other thing that their own power and how to use this power to get pleasure. Their crimes don´t have a political aim. Their crimes have a sexual aim. And all of this is more universal than Italy in the Second World War.<br/><br/>Third: At the beginning, we can read the title ""anteinferno"". I think this is the real sense of the movie: a walk down to the hell. The film -in very loyalty with Sade- reflects a very deep and unbearable void. This is that makes the film harder than any gore film. The absolute lack of ethics is more terrible than all the tortures. In this way, Passolini doesn´t show any friendship with the slaves. The viewer ends with a bitter feeling, a feeling of non sense. At the end of the movie there is no hope. And one thing is true: nobody who has seen the film forget it.<br/><br/>Fourth: Here is a very good example how 70´s films were the hardest. Nobody can think about to see in a cinema a movie like this today."

","I think, we all agree, that Pasolini was an Artist, with capital A, and as we all know, artists, who are aware their abilities and gifts, will often become eccentric, ruthless, and arrogant. They just think, we all need to hear what they have to tell. I beg to differ. I'm not interested anymore.<br/><br/>This piece of art could be easily recognized as a ""piece of art"" from the fact, that its NOT entertaining at all, but still, its a cult movie (at least many people said that). <br/><br/>Pasolini have been always interested in exploitation, sexual themes, or at least in erotica. There are no Pasolini films without a whole lot of nude bodies... my mistake: Jesus at least had a loin on him in Matthews evangelion... Okay, so there are no pasolini films, without a whole lot of nude bodies, OR at least some violence. In this on you will get an overdose of both. <br/><br/>The script is an adaptation of the infamous work from the Marque De Sade, which now takes place in salo, the last stand of the fascist Italy (pasolini's older brother died there too, as far as i know). At the very beginning of the movie, the Italian BigWigs move their capitol there, and collect a bunch of young people from town, to have fun with. From this point the whole movie is an endless fest of exploitation.<br/><br/>The story is very well build: the more the film advances, the more the violence level rises. You can sit there stunned after every disturbing scene, and keeping it in mind, that there's even worse to come. The acting is very powerful too. Victims truly seem miserable, and their dominators are the most disgusting scum in movies history. <br/><br/>Okay, now that i praised this one so much, you may wonder, why did i gave it a 1? Because its annoying. Viewing horrific scenes, with some very deep thoughts behind them is just doesn't work. Violence and sex are cheap material, so if there are too much of them in a movie, i just couldn't be taken this seriously. In that case, one may at least suggest some fun, and entertainment in the movie. Movies like ""Cannibal holocaust"", or ""Trouble every day"", both have violent scenes too, but they had been made in a good rhythm, and have never been taken seriously by anyone. This one's slow, dark, annoying, violent, EVIL, but gives nothing else. <br/><br/>You will feel bad about this movie. Really bad. If you don't want to feel really bad, just avoid this mock."

","No matter how much you prepare for it, this film will disturb you. You might think you know what it holds, but it will still shock. It is not that the film is excessively violent, or pornographic. Although the film features a heavy dose of sex and violence, this is not the lasting impression that the film leaves. Pasolini was a master film maker. In some ways he is similar to Kubrick; in that the more of his films you see the more you appreciate each one. Salo is his final film. In it the debauchery of de Sade and evil of fascism are juxtaposed that leaves a bad taste in your mouth. The tormentors are so completely without human empathy. There are several excellent reasons to see this film. If you want to see a work of art this is for you. If you want to experience his feelings on the social and political climate of post war Italy then it is appropriate. <br/><br/>However if you desire to just see a film that is ""f'd up"" then I would suggest looking elsewhere.

","Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma"" (""Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"" in English) turned out to be his final movie, and got released a few weeks after his murder. Since he was known for movies that riled the authorities, this was a natural choice for him. While the main thing that one notices is the shock value, Pasolini noted that he intended the movie as a look at the relation between power and its subjects. Indeed, for what reason did Mussolini turn Italy into a police state but to let the ruling class be able to do whatever they wanted? To be certain, the middle-aged prostitutes who tell the young men stories to sexually arouse them are the equivalent of bread and circuses.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a story of humanity's base impulses taken to their horrific extremes. It's easy to view this as one of the most disgusting movies ever filmed, but Pasolini made it to indict fascism and Italy's ruling class in general. I recommend it, but only watch it if you have a strong stomach."

","This film was recommended to me as a groundbreaking, trendsetting, example of horror film unlike anything I had ever seen. And it is unlike anything I had ever seen in that I don't think I have ever seen a more uninteresting and boring film. The shock value is there, there is no denying that the movie goes for the throat so to speak, with regards to trying way too hard to evoke visceral reactions from the viewer with gratuitous representations of morbidity and depravity. However the production is so poor that mostly it comes across as having the same level of production value as a high school musical. The practical effects are weak, and in the 70's nudity was far from being scandalous whereas now it is just downright tame. The ideas presented in the film are convoluted and a little bit ridiculous. Meandering monologues of old men speaking directly into the camera and shaky camera work throughout the film make it difficult to watch and take seriously despite the grave nature of the subject matter. If you handle boredom well and have a stomach for unsophisticated juvenile political ideals then maybe this outdated eye vomit will be tolerable and entertaining. <br/><br/>I found reading the reviews here to be far more entertaining and interesting than the movie itself"
"AudemarsPiguet","7","3","7","18 October 2005"," Italian history X : an almost-masterpiece
","After watching Salo,I was not shocked by its sexuality or violence,rather by its lack of artistic honesty and historical accuracy.The same feeling I got watching Visconti's The Damned ,where historical facts are oversimplified,overblown beyond recognition. In both films the intention is to depict how cruel and immoral the Right-wing dictatorships in recent history were and both suggest that by e.g. amplifying the degree of sexual perversion of its protagonists.In fact,like it was often pointed out,there is little connection between a deviant sexuality and an oppressive political rule. Turning historical villains into perverts is cartoon-style and adds nothing to the intellectual level of the public;it manipulates into being forcefully outraged,stirring up not the violent but the fundamentalist,prude,judgmental instincts in all of us.If cinema tricks you into it,you should indulge in your ""five minutes of hate"",only because you do something supposedly moral by hating someone who is completely flawed and therefore you do your moral duty by hating him. So,the public's homophobia,puritanism,sexual purity,bi-phobia, was cleverly(intentionally or not)used by Pasolini in this film to stir up everyone's hate against the Fascits.First you are appalled by what you see ,but as soon as the mind replaces the instincts,one is tending to question the authenticity of this film. Actually,Fascism,Nazism and the Bourgeosie were sexually more restrained than Pasolini portrays them,but as these three form a symbolical triangle of his hatred and phobia,he must vilify them beyond any limits of supportability.Partly it is not his fault,because,as I have correctly seen in other user comments,the extreme and unrealistic criticism of Salo was not singular in that period.Even if The Damned,The Conformist or 1900 were less violent films,they all fit into the same ideology:in yesterday's European art cinema it was OK and even encouraged to depict the Right-winged evil at the verge of porn,horror and Gothic. So this is the main reason why I find Pasolini's death as a political commission illogical,as contemporaries bearing equally violent,slightly more restrained messages not only against the Nazis,but also against Bourgeios establishment weren't slashed.Also I find it unlikely that Pasolini was clipped by one of the underage actors from this film,it is hard to fancy that these submissive pubescent teens would have overrun him with his Alfa Romeo.Still,a movie with a potential and meaning,if it weren't for the fact that the villains were almost liturgically repeating:we are arrogant,we are supremacist snobs,we are the bad guys,beware etc.Yet the actuality of this film is not faded,events like these are actually possible nowadays even in democratic countries-parts of the practices seen in the orgy happened in occupied Irak almost yesterday. The famous experiment of Dr.Philip Zimbardo proved that the nightmare situations from 1984 can easily come true:anyone of us can potentially become a torturer.Also the Alied troops didn't necessarily bring joy and eternal peace into Fascist Italy:seeing the equally violent La Pelle where G.I.'s indulge in the same violence with the subjects of the occupied country,it's not always Fascits:bad-Allies:good.And the Communist Pasolini should have known that in the Communist gulags the treatment was roughly the same. Many have seen the parallel between Salo and the Biblical Tale of Sodom,but there's also another story from the Old Testament hinted at:as the young people are tortured,killed,it is similar to one of the plagues brought by God's wrath over Egypt-the death of the younger generations. As for the excrement scene,was intended to be against mass proceed food,but it is actually more of an offense brought to the simple,honest citizen who regularly buys his food from a mall or a drive-in;even if it's unhealthy,it is hard to actually say upfront:you're eating...because even if he knew he'd be glad to buy it affordable.Was Pasolini vegan or high cuisine fan to have the authority to judge? The underage sex ,anything else but pornographic,failing to arouse,might shock on screen,but the same society(without being the republic of Salo)is shamelessly pushing teens trough media,music,fashion to ""do it"" increasingly younger.It happens in the U.S. and everywhere and thus the teeny stars have up to a point no better destiny than the prisoners of Salo. The torture scenes are rather restrained and somewhat Bunuelian,reminding of the famous eye from ""Un Chien Andalou"". In its complexity of cultural and symbolical aspects this film is more than hard to stomach,one should have the courage to read between its graphic and psychological violence. It certainly pushed the boundaries of art film,of what is allowed in one,yet it is still an art film even if (highly arguable) the most gruesome and daring ever. Still,this film is accomplished due to its debate about guilt(and maybe even a hint at the omnipresent and controversial issue of the Holocaust),placing it on a similar level with the much less violent and more symbolical,yet equally chilling and bleak Georgian masterpiece Repentance,due to the fact that in both of the films the young and innocent have to pay for the corruption of the political and moral terror brought about by their elders. At a closer look the two films have resembling symbols-while in Salo we see a bearded man dressed up effeminately enjoying a voyeuristic masturbation-session while watching the teens being tortured,in Repentance a dirty bearded man is greedily eating a hulking cake resembling to a house or church,stating proudly that dictatorship is not bad-in both cases the symbol stands for decaying patriarchal values,the self-devouring Bourgeoisie and the forces of omnipresent Vanity and destruction. Maybe it signifies also the decay of comfortable Western society due to its moral ambiguity(and Salo should be the historical precedent),but in virtually all Anti-Nazi films(including this) the feeling of the Apocalypse is so strong towards the ending,that the viewer might think that all life was wiped out. Yet it wasn't totally eliminated,even if some historians and moralists question whether life after Auschwitz is legitimate. Cynically speaking not only life went on after wards but also the atrocities,performed even by Pasolini's fellow Communists and partly even in democratic countries. So that history repeats like a vicious cycle is fact,that Pasolini tried to warn us to break the cycle is questionable,if not mere fiction."
"poolandrews","5","3","7","12 February 2005"," A film with something to offend most tastes!
","'1944-45 Northern Italy, during the Nazi-Fascist occupation ANTE INFERNO' no I don't know what it means either but that's what appears on screen at the very start to Salo O Le 120 Giornate Di Sodoma after the opening credits. Four people are sitting around a table, The Duke (Paolo Bonacelli), The Bishop (Giorgio Cataldi), The Magistrate or his Excellence (Umberto Paolo Quintavalle) and the President (Aldo Valletti) and each sign a book of their made up 'laws'. They send soldiers out to capture 18 teenagers, 9 boys and 9 girls. One boy tries to escape and is shot dead. They are taken to a large house where they are told the 'laws'. Thereafter this film is a boring bombardment of filth, degradation, humiliation and perverted sexual activity. The film is loosely split into three sections, the first being called 'Circle of Manias' where a woman named Signora Vaccari (Helene Surgere) tells extremely unerotic stories of how she was abused by a paedophile Priest when she was seven and her first experience as a prostitute when she was nine as the men in charge eagerly listen on and masturbate or get someone to for them, boy or girl as it doesn't matter to them. One of the teenage girls commits suicide. We also get the 'pleasure' of seeing various other types of torture and humiliation as people are raped, lead around on dog leads and made to eat food with razors hidden inside. Next it's 'Cirle of Sh*t'. It does exactly what it says on the tin, Signora Maggi (Elsa De Giorgi) tells a story about how a client of hers ate her excrement and so the powers that be decide to give it a try. They make everyone eat certain things and collect their waste and present it all at dinner for everyone to eat, it's as disgusting as it sounds and it's filmed in such a emotionless way like it's normal. We are also 'treated' to a who's bum is best contest, the four men in charge walk around and inspect their prisoners bottoms and have to decide who's is best. Some funny dialogue here as they discuss things like weight and elasticity! Oh, there's also a golden shower scene where a guy makes a teenage girl urinate on his face and in his mouth, nice. After the men in charge find out that a lot of their prisoners are breaking the laws the film goes into the 'Circle of Blood'. This is the part where they torture and kill various boys and girls for their crimes. A scalping, burning nipples and genitals, gouging eyes out and hanging are some of the methods used as the men in charge partake, watch and/or masturbate. Then the film just sort of ends suddenly. Co-written and directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini this is one messed up film. There are plenty of reviews of this film around that try and uncover lots of different meanings and try to justify what appears on screen with intellectual reasoning but I can't really see all that arty stuff in a film. I see what is presented in front of me, simple as that. What this film is is really dull and boring for starters, it goes on for too long and is actually quite slow. None of the characters were developed to the extent I would like and most are there just to be used and abused by freaks. It's notorious controversial moments are there for sure and still retain the power to shock even after 30 odd years. Some of this has to be seen and heard to be believed. I can appreciate it as a thought provoking film that has definite power but if you want entertainment look elsewhere, and for me that's what's watching films is all about. The photography is quite flat and static but the production design was nice. There is virtually no music during the film either. I won't be in any hurry to watch it again anytime soon but I'm sure large parts of this film will stay in my memory for a long time. Shocking, controversial, offencive, repellent and distressing describe Salo well, as does dull, boring and ultimately pointless. I would never recommend this film to anyone I know, avoid unless your completely sure you want to see it."

Many years ago I took the opportunity to watch this movie when it was briefly unbanned and I had heard good things about it on the original Movie Show, with David and Margaret. I think David said something along the lines that this movie was a scathing critique of Nazism or fascism or something-my response to this later.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is based on a book or something by the doomed pre Revolutionary French aristocrat the Marquis de Sade (can you guess how this will turn out yet?). From the writings of de Sade, we get the term ""sadism"" (guessed yet?). Oddly, whilst browsing the ""classics"" section of a bookshop, I noticed that it contained stuff by de Sade!<br/><br/>The movie updates the setting of the original to more contemporary times-the Mussolini era of Italian history, I think.<br/><br/>Back to Stratton's comments on the movie-I couldn't disagree more. I found this movie to be a celebration of sickness and perversion. Sadists would like this movie, I think, but not if they baulk at murder. Masochists (named after the Dolphin de Maso...look him up) would not, as the cruelty in this movie is not consensual...no 'safety' words here, like ""God that hurts!!""-words being unutterable in some cases in this movie.<br/><br/>Even though I don't remember too much of the context of the movie-I do recall what you would call ""the victims"" entering this environment-maybe it's some military establishment or something. And I remember some of the EXTREME cruelty perpetrated on them. There is blood in this movie and some of the scenarios are really horrible.<br/><br/>Also memorable are the scenes of 'feasting'. Eating what? Er, I'm not talking cannibalism here...but gee, you wouldn't want to plan eating sticky date pudding afterwards!<br/><br/>I also remember one scene-in long shot, thankfully, where I blinked before the director did...in other words, when something gory is about to happen, you don't get a cut away...you have to endure the horror, unless, like I did, you turn away in horror.<br/><br/>Perhaps this movie is rightly banned, at least here in Australia-not a case of nanny-state meddling.

Old guys and gals dressed up in posh clothes telling boring stories of being sodomised when they were kids, leading to one of the men, for example, rushing off into a room to re-enact his fantasies with one of the young captives, being about as exciting as it gets.<br/><br/>There's plenty of frontal nudity and lots of pretty girls, but the awkward 'pretend' sex scenes, viewed from behind with a guys' head bobbing up and down while supposedly giving a blow job, is pretty sad. It's not porn, it's not horror, but it does have a scat element to it.<br/><br/>I didn't find the film erotic or dramatic. There was no tension or suspense. No plot, no escape no character development, just a group of old degenerates re-enacting their turgid fantasies in an old castle.<br/><br/>I didn't sympathise with or like any of the characters because they were all cardboard cut-outs with lifeless personalities, telling lame jokes and sitting around getting ravishingly bored.<br/><br/>Maybe I've become desensitised over the years, but there is nothing very shocking about this film except for the scenes involving human faeces, which are more disgusting than shocking ITBT.<br/><br/>In fact, the best part about the film is the opening credits accompanied by lovely instrumental music (the reason I awarded it two stars instead of one) giving us the impression we're about to witness a 1940's romantic comedy or thriller.<br/><br/>There's no tension, drama, suspense, horror, gore or anything else besides some nasty sh*t-eating scenes. There's nothing novel about any of it. Perhaps in 1975 the thought of male/lesbian liaisons and anal penetration was very shocking? I really don't know because I wasn't watching this sort of thing back then. I couldn't wait for the end.<br/><br/>I don't understand awkward noir politics and it's multitude of factions, but I did take a few minutes to remind myself of the meaning of fascism in this particular instance: a group of four middle-aged to elderly guys, in powerful positions such as the president or arch-bishop, mercilessly exercising their authority on a group of less powerful, younger people, making them have awkward sex, sit uncomfortably on the floor while hearing boring stories, or sometimes eat and sit in buckets of sh*t.<br/><br/>Perhaps a third star is required because I DID actually make it to the end and into the courtyard torture scenes - finally, but I'm never going to let it grow on me."

There are films that are disgusting but compelling, others that are disgusting but watchable up to a point. This is almost unbearable from the first viewing. Yes, art can disgust us and shock us. But this, almost two hours of cinematic crap, with absolutely no ""deeper meaning"" is the furthest removed thing from ""art"" I have ever seen, and anyone who appreciates real art should certainly not appreciate this.<br/><br/>To anyone who wants to watch this - certainly do so if you wish, and judge for yourselves.

"drownnnsoda","10","4","11","10 June 2009"," Oh, ""Salo""
","Decried, lauded, and branded the most repulsive film of all time, it's difficult to even talk about ""Salo."" What is there to say that hasn't been said? Pasolini's final film has a group of libertines and accomplice prostitutes rounding up teenage boys and girls like cattle, and subjecting them to sexual, mental, and physical torture in WWII-Italy before systematically butchering them. Sounds like a good time, no?<br/><br/>In spite of is graphic content, I am in the camp of people who appreciate this film for its visuals and thematic content. While there is an argument to be made that ""Salo"" is tasteless, it's difficult to say it's artless; the film is loaded with gorgeous compositions and set pieces that look like Italian Renaissance paintings. And perhaps it's the beauty of so much of the film that makes its other content so disturbing. <br/><br/>The violence in the film is abhorrent, depicted and played by the actors with a plainness that registers as uncomfortably authentic. They are psychologically toyed with, raped and sexualized, and ultimately mutilated. Pasolini remarked his intentions to show the ""anarchy of power"" with the film, and the display is honest. The graphic brutalization, from the coprophilia and to the sexual violence, is thick with metaphor; simultaneously, it's also representative of reality to some degree, and that's probably why so many turn away. It's not pleasant to watch, chiefly because it's morally corrupt and physically repulsive, but also because it demonstrates a nasty truth: That there is a monster in all of us.<br/><br/>I don't believe ""Salo"" is the frivolous exploitation as some have deemed it, although it is unquestionably a progenitor of today's ""torture porn."" It's natural to have an averse reaction to this film, but that's part of the point; and as pretentious as one can argue that that is, it's also a singular stroke of genius in a way, almost Warholian. The unique thing about ""Salo"" is that it is as much metaphor as it is realization, and interwoven within is poetry, both visual and literate. Pasolini's admitted chief aim here was to criticize the unchecked powers of fascism, the byproduct of which is unchecked violence, so I find it hard to believe that the film in any way celebrates physical horrors so much as it throws them on the altar. Humanity can be unspeakable—make of it what you will."

","A group of fascist and nihilistic libertines - the Duke (Paolo Bonacelli), the Bishop (Giorgio Cataldi), the Magistrate (Umberto Paolo Quintavalle) and the President (Aldo Valletti) - wield their power for perverse means. Namely selecting 9 boys and 9 girls to forcefully participate in an extreme 120 day orgy. Helped out by four elderly prostitutes (Caterina Boratto, Elsa De Giorgi, Hélène Surgère, Sonia Saviange) they manipulate, degrade and indulge into obscene acts of denigration, stimulation, mutilation capping it off with some well earned torture.<br/><br/>Now... first off people say this movie is sick. Yes, it is out there and it is extreme. Especially with the feces dinner right smack in the middle of Pasolini's explotapiece and the mass torture scene that is the big finale of this movie. But all in all I was expecting something way more disgusting and appalling. Maybe all the torture porn of the modern era has made me desensitised, but I really can't see what all the fuss is about. It probably was out there back in the days, but nowadays you have movies doing the same but better and more realistically (albeit eating poop is rarely viewed and these scenes remain quite strong).<br/><br/>Second off the movie feels like a very shallow attack on fascism and fascists and less as a comment on the human condition. You never really felt that any of main characters were real and anything other than caricatures. On the other hand the victims of the movie are so underdeveloped that they have no dramatic influence on the movie - they serve just one purpose and that is sexual cannon fodder. They may be victimised, but apart from a couple of scenes you aren't really given a chance to experience their emotions and reactions to the situation. I'm not expecting in your face crying, but maybe fleshing out one or two victims may have given the movie a better edge in the context of commenting on the human condition.<br/><br/>Third off I must agree with what many people say. It did seem pointless and without substance. Essentially there are many movies nowadays that give an equally extreme recollection of torture and rape, but deal with the underlying issues of morality with much more credibility and depth. All in all Pasolini seemed only intent to shock with his last movie, but did not put enough focus on actually having something to say with this picture, instead riddling it with artsy shots, quirky scenes and poetic pointless dialogue.<br/><br/>Unfortunately in the end an unnecessary movie by a great director."

Many have praised or blamed Pasolini for the depravity that is gleefully portrayed but this is, of course, the ultimate Sadean movie and the great writer must ultimately remain responsible for forcing us to see the, so called, evil tendency within us all.

","If you think that any & all of the recent wave of torture porn films even remotely began with Saw,guess again. In 1975,Pier Paulo Pasolini undertook his last film project,based loosely on a novel by the Marquis De Sade (Pasolini would meet with a tragic death later that year in 1975,during a ill chosen homosexual pick up,where Pasolini was found dead in his car,with his throat slashed,several miles from the pick up spot, at a petrol station/rest stop),The 20 Days,that told tale of a band of degenerates that brings a cadre of young people to a castle & eventually demean and torture to death. 'Salo,Or The 120 Days Of The Sodom' is the result of that book. A group of Communist young people (boys & girls)are arrested by the Fascists,brought to a posh country home & for the next four months,are subjected to some of the most dehumanizing realms of debauchery,torture & eventually are murdered by the Fascists,one by one. This is not...repeat,NOT an easy film to watch (Screw publisher, Al Goldstein walked out of a screening in sheer disgust). The film is populated by a top notch cast of Italian non professionals (which Pasolini was fond of working with). The photography is lush & makes good use of the environment it was filmed in. Undertake at your own risk. Spoken in Italian with English subtitles. Originally rated 'X' by the MPAA,this film serves up some truly nasty scenes of torture,graphic violence,full frontal male & female nudity & graphic sexuality,both heterosexual as well as gay."

","There are many films which are sought after for serious consideration of art. In films such movies are rarely accepted as artistic rendering. Of course any listed work can be further critiqued as to literal substance or moral value. One example are the works of the famous French writer the Marquis De Sade which begins and ends with the survival of his written books. Although many directors from several countries have attempted their own interpretation of the Comte's work, few can adequately reach the darkest depths ascribed to the sexually licentious's dreams of the inmate imprisoned at the secluded asylum at Charenton. One director who attempted was Paolo Pasolini who gave the world this film entitled ""One hundred twenty days at Sadom."" The other name for it was ""Salo-Republic."" Anyone wishing to see this dark cinema, had better have a cast iron stomach as it gets awful black in the snake pit. I always believed I knew what perversion was until I watched this film. I have since learned what cinematic depravity is. Taken from the journals of the 15th century Marquis, this modern interpretation is recreated during the heyday of Nazi Germany and Mussolini's socialist period. Nevertheless, a group of sadistic aristocrats kidnap various 'perfect' young men and women, and subject them to the brutal nature of De Sade' violent manifesto. What is seen is nothing short of cruel sexuality gone mad. In short, this is one film which is not suited for the faint hearted. In fact, this is not a suitable movie for anyone not mentally dead. **"
"estheleda","7","2","4","28 May 2006"," In reply to the 'Should I watch Salo' posters
","There's a long thread on the theme 'I was/was not disturbed by this film; it did/did not haunt my entire adulthood,' so let's have some _information_ on Salo:<br/><br/>Apart from its resetting in time and place, it's not dissimilar to the book (less extreme, though). There's not so much mathematics, so it unfolds less like an insanely detailed private fantasy which would never be read but for shock value, yet keeps, even increases, the distance between the viewer and the events. The sex, violence (minimal), movement, and laughing remind me of mime and other forms of silent, slow, exaggerated theatre. It isn't pornographic or passionate. There's little blood until the end. Every action is unreal, a simplified, animated diagram of sex or other movement.<br/><br/>It doesn't make an effort to be arousing; it shows the play of actions without any interpretation. It's like a BBC2 nature documentary, on people. This is what gives it it's air of bleakness (people on the boards have compared it to films such as _Schindler's List_); if you're sensitive to this sort of thing, and able to empathise with blank characters, it might disturb you.<br/><br/>There are a few 'realistic' parts -- two incidences of sex towards the end, and one of the girls pleads, naked, for mercy, help from God, and death, but I would like to emphasise the point that _the viewer does not get pulled into the characters' world_. You watch it and stay detached. Like the book, it's not so much an investigation of the effects of torture on the victims, as a simple catalogue of deviancies. It's interesting as a middle step between the modules of the fantasy listed on paper, and how it might play out in real life. It doesn't show the real life part.<br/><br/>It isn't always clear what class (victim, militiaman) a character falls into. The picture on the version I saw was very fuzzy; the film looked older than 31 years. There are long periods of silence between the piano accompaniment to the madam's stories, and the rest of the film's soundtrack, but the music there is complements the scene well, becoming almost uplifting at the end (very _Tea with Mussolini_). There's almost constant nudity, including male and female full-frontal, but it's no more sexualised than you'd see on a nudist beach. The only titillation is in the balance of power, and that's muted. Even the sense of despair is absent.<br/><br/>It's not as graphic as it's hyped to be. No teen who's read a porn story labelled 'BDSM real slavery' should have a problem. It's disturbing because it's told from the point of view of the libertines, which clashes with that of viewers. Other than that, there's crossdressing, coprophagia, and some mutilation. More interesting is the apathy of the victims; and there are some beautiful expressions on the faces of both victims and masters.<br/><br/>It's not a metaphor for anything, or a 'necessary evil to be made.' There doesn't have to be a justification for the existence of everything slightly out of the mainstream. Watch it if you want to. You probably won't find it fun to watch, and I don't think it will teach you anything. If you do watch, stick it out till the end."

The film also, slightly, depressed me because of the message it sent towards the audience. The pros of watching the movie were some of the cinematography scenes and the message it gives. Pasolini had the tendency to make films that were generally dark, this one being his darkest film, but he made his message clear enough for the audience to grasp. The message here is how evil and disturbing humankind can be. This is a film that I would not want to watch again, but it is a film that you should consider seeing at least once."

Perhaps seeming a little aged around the edges it still has the power to shock and appal. That is an impressive feat considering all the extreme horrors films that have been released since.<br/><br/>It is easy to say who should book a flight to the other side of the world when the film starts.

Scenes ( especially a disturbing circle near the end, I don't want to give away the 'key' moments), linger in the mind like a nightmarish gallery of torment.

","Salo is a kind of film that will make the viewer confused weather he likes the movie or not and that's the beauty of it. It is different from those films which concentrates on disturbing the viewers with violence while making it entertaining whereas Salo makes its audiences realize violence is not meant to be entertaining rather disgusting and unmerciful. It concentrates on both physical and mental torture that will leave the audience thinking about the film long after they've watched it. Its one of those films that makes you think ""Gosh I hope that never happens to anybody"" The violence in this movie builds up gradually and are the least expected ones. One of the things that makes the movie so horrifying is that the sort of things shown in the movie can actually happen in real life and had me confused if it actually did! There is no hope for the victims, they are trapped and their only option is to choose between dying a fast or slow death."

","Pasolini's ""Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom"" is available on YouTube, without English subtitles, but that doesn't really matter, it works as a silent movie and if you want to know the story, read the Marquis de Sade's book which inspired it. It's a tough film to watch and is the complete opposite of his previous bawdy and fun stuff like the Decameron. I'm not sure whether the transposition of the 'story' from absolutist France of De Sade to a latter-day Italian fascist mini-state works well. Stripping down the nature of power to torture, degradation and sex is a little limiting in its social criticism of the positions of Duke, Banker, General and Bishop - and the linking of fascism with capitalism. What it does well is the equal opportunity in degrading the sexes. No sexism here. Considering it a porn or horror movie is doing the movie a disfavour. Recommended to watch once (I don't think many will feel the need to watch it again) but do read De Sade's 120 Days of Sodom, a hilarious book."

And nowhere can that destructive urge be seen so disturbingly clear then salo'or the 120 days of Sodom. The last film to be directed by controversial Italian art house director pier Paolo passolini. And ironically based on the last work of the marquis disad.<br/><br/>The plot is quite simple. A group of four fascist libertines with an entourage of armed guards, four to five aging whores,and other assorted perverts.Who proceed to round up and kidnap approximately 18 teenage boys and girls and take them to a villa in the in the republic of salo in the final days world war 2. For the remainder of the film said young people are raped,tortured,humiliated,and eventually those who do not give up there will completely are eventually murdered.<br/><br/>Now many have asked "" why would someone watch this film,let alone review it?"". i wont lie for a minute,i have seen many horror and art films.

It is one of the few films i have came across to that not only lives up to its bad reputation but surpasses it on multiple levels.<br/><br/>All unpleasentry aside this film has a few interesting points to it. There are a number of parallels to the inferno by Dante algary. Namley how the content is divided into chapters called circles with both an intro chapter and a finale. And how each chapter focuses on increasingly more deviant sexual behavior. The antechamber to hell,the circle of obsession's,the circle feces , and the final culmination in the circle of blood. Also from a character standpoint,That once each victim is captured there is no real hope for them other then cooperating with there captors hence sealing there souls in a matter of speaking. Abandon hope all ye who enter really sums up that thought.<br/><br/>Also like many others,there is no redemption in this film. There is no justice.The villains can only be compared to locusts. They appear,they indulge,they vanish and leave destruction in there wake. What's most upsetting i guess is the fact that the victims are so young. When you watch a film where an adult is tortured and brutalised,there is less sympathy on the part of the viewer. It really boils down to the corruption and slaughter of the innocent.<br/><br/>However what makes this film important is the fact that it shows fascism for what it truly is. Something that is evil and ultimately destructive. And the many scenes of rape go hand in hand with the themes of fascism and control. <br/><br/>The film itself doesn't sugarcoat or try to obscure the truth. It shows the true atrocities that only man is capable of.

","Someone lent me the then brand new BFI VHS of this appalling film in 2002, he didn't want it back and I couldn't blame him. I saw it the once, but finally threw the tape in the wheelie bin a couple of weeks ago without bothering with it again. I was fascinated by the hoohah it caused in 1975 and always felt I had to see it to see which side of the fence I was on, but regretted my curiosity afterwards. Curiosity killed by scat. In fact, since then any curiosity I used to have to see heavy arty modern films has dropped to near zero saving me both time and money, so I can thank Salo for something at least (meaning 1 mark and a belated comment marking garbage joining the rest of the garbage, a ceremonial act meant to be self-purging and of repentance.<br/><br/>De Sade wrote his book specifically to appal everyone except perverts, it was turned here into unlovely clumsy pointless porn ostensibly factual about Fascists made by a fascist and intended for fascists. Think of: What if customers had paid for guided tours of Belsen when it was in full swing, and you've got it. If you're watching it and not getting any kicks but feel you must hang on to the bitter end for a moral or even a message you will be disappointed, for there is none in the film itself. Years later I can say that fairly cheerfully, but back then it would have been with a sense of horror, with the despair of having wasted my time and blighted my mind for nothing. It tells you more about the human condition in perverts wanting to get such vileness out there into the perversion market, and perverts pretending ordinary filth is meaningful Art in self defence or in denial. In that sense only is it relevant and a metaphor for the problems of the world. The biggest problem is capitalism and all of its manifold perversions which will remain blissfully unaffected by people watching films like this who support capitalism and therefore all of its manifold perversions. There must be thousands - millions! - of sleazy bdsm films in porn shops or on the internet that are artier and with more meaning than this, honest hardcore made by little teams of perverts not interested in hiding behind Art, interested only in getting people to buy the product, get off on it and come back for more. Timid Pasolini thankfully was hidebound by some ordinary conventions anyway  no penetration for instance (remember how excited the perverts at Film Four and the BFI were when Ai No Corrida was finally passed for release a few years back!); no animals, snuff or worse, but plenty of hairy naked cattle either being herded around, tortured or eating pretend poo off the floor was his bag. For what it's worth the acting, direction and production values are all rather crappy too, but that's the least of its problems. Because of the polarity of opinions it's sadly guaranteed a very long shelf life with future generations either getting off or throwing up  is this what film as an art form is all about? Can real Art meant for ordinary people ever be lighthearted or inspiring again, or must it always be nonsensical or pornography made by talentless wasters like Pasolini or as nowadays mainly from well meaning anal retentives from in favour demographics? What it boils down to is: Did Pasolini win his geologically brief immortality with an open hearted kiss to the world or with a cynical fart in our faeces? <br/><br/>It was banned for decades  I wish our Betters at the BBFC still had had a vestige of moral fibre to have kept it that way for those unwary of us still left with some, but that genie's out of the bottle now. Censors used to be paid to protect the general public by filthying up their minds instead of ours, now they seem to be paid solely to help entice innocent folk into admiring debauchery  one not so fine day it'll be on TV at teatime, and they'll be partly responsible. She's not likely to be interested in this but I'd be very sad if my 28 yo daughter ever saw this even though she's quite inured to mindless sex and violence on film as along with cgi cartoonery it's all de rigueur nowadays. It's almost as bad as Blazing Saddles, which was a porn of a different colour but at least was quite forgettable. However if you watch this I'm afraid you won't ever be quite the same again, which after all was one of the Marquis de Pasolini's aims. My advice is to think of nice things to do or see instead  you could fall asleep watching the wife gardening, or see the 1939 Wizard Of Oz for the twentieth time for example, it being a true Art film. The point is: keep your innocence - you won't miss anything of any positive worth so don't ever give way to watch this  unless you feel you'd enjoy being raped."

","""Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma"" is, undoubtedly, a very effective film. I spent several hours reading reviews of this film before watching it this evening. I am not into films that are sick and grotesque merely to push the envelope of what is considered art. Anyone can defecate on canvas and label it so, but saying it is so doesn't make it so. This film has more interpretations than five times its minutes in length. I suppose different people see different things and, in no small way, what one brings with them and their reasons for wishing to expose themselves to it, play a large role in where the experience will take them. For me, the experience was very reminiscent of Ken Russell's 1971 Film ""The Devils"" http://imdb.com/title/tt0066993/ in the way it portrays the evils those in power inflict upon the commoner. For me, there is only one reason which seems fitting to endure this film and that is to understand the depravity that exists in our world and where it ultimately leads if left unchecked by the citizens of a society. If you watch this film intending to see image upon image of nudity, you will be disappointed. If you come to the table to challenge yourself to see how much abuse your eyes and mind can handle, I think most will be equally disappointed. However, there is not one single act of perversion which is not represented here, and although many of the folks who have reviewed this film have remarked how uncomfortable and un-arousing this film is, either due to their naiveté or inability to be honest with themselves, they are not being truthful. Granted, a good number of people will find this film abhorrently objectionable, but one only needs to spend a small bit of time on the internet and in cinemas today to recognize that the perversions and depravity in this film are severely dwarfed by real life. After all, we live in a time where ""torture porn"" is an extremely popular genre, the mere description indicating sexual arousal by means of torture and violence. The public is addicted to sexual violence, perversions, and debauchery. It is what sells. That is why, apparently, most have submitted to ""Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma"" and the state of disheartening unease they discover themselves in when the final credits roll compels them to seek justification, a rationale, some reasonable excuse as to why they subjected themselves to such a soul-less and nihilistic onslaught of images and sound. Truly, the film empties the viewer of all hope and feelings of well-being. That, or it sexually excites and motivates the sociopath to deviancy by opening doors and nailing them to remain open. It is the latter group which is most disconcerting and, I believe, the number of which is far under-estimated.<br/><br/>""Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma"" provides a prophetic vision of where we are headed, while reminding us of where we were and where we are currently. I cannot recommend this film and I cannot say that it will better anyone for having seen it. There is absolutely no necessity for or about it. However, it will forever change you and how you view the world. One reviewer wisely commented on how this film changed his perception of the horror genre, and although I don't see this film as horror per se, the reviewer's point was quite profound. Therein lies the art of its effectiveness."

"Rachmaninoff28","3","3","8","26 October 2013"," The discussion here is far more interesting and intellectual than the film itself!
","I don't believe art's role is to ""entertain"" (although it can do that) but to engage, stimulate, inspire, confront, challenge, etc. And it certainly doesn't have to be nice about it! If a work of art does any of those things for me (and, of course, this is highly subjective), then it works for me.<br/><br/>This is why I believe that Salò is very flimsy artistically. The craft of it, including the excruciatingly wooden acting and equally wooden script, simply weren't sufficient for me to ever suspend disbelief, and I was therefore never engaged by what was going on. There's no plot development, no journey, no character development, no emotional insight into characters. Nothing. Like its subject matter, the film itself is dehumanized. No doubt this was intentional, and its almost ""anti-art"" aspects are part of the film's ""art"" (for other people...), but its effect on me was that I was always aware that I was watching (second rate) actors reading a (second rate) script. And I just didn't care about any of it.<br/><br/>The shock value was kind of minimal, too. I came to this film already aware that it focuses on horrible depravity. I watched it and saw a depiction of horrible depravity. So what? It needed a framework to have meaning and, therefore, rise above the level of a splatter movie (but see below).<br/><br/>I don't believe Pasolini was commenting on Fascism or any -ism, but simply on the darkness within human beings (and certainly within himself) and used that period of Italy's history as an appropriate context and pretext. I guess someone needed to make a film that showed this. It's been done now...<br/><br/>If there is artistic merit to this film, I believe it's because it's so open to interpretation: Pasolini shows us human depravity, leaving it up to us to make of it what we will, to bring our own frameworks with us to give it meaning. (Some people even see a criticism of fast food in the pooh-eating scenes!) How much of this was part of Pasolini's design, though, I have no idea. But as art, it's right up there with, say, putting a mutilated animal carcass on display in an art gallery and calling it, say, ""Installation 38b."" That's pretty shallow art. (And, in 2013, quite dated -- which is another criticism I have of this film. Good art doesn't date.)<br/><br/>The only real moral stand (and intellectual substance) I can find here is that by not providing a framework, Pasolini is rejecting the mind-control philosophy typical of the Fascists and other totalitarian regimes. Again, though, I'm not really engaged, stimulated, inspired, confronted, or challenged by that. But it is a nice idea."
"mdupla1","4","3","8","20 January 2011"," Salo is revolting, but it does merit a discussion of artistic merit.
","This as ""art"" makes for fascinating debate, as it, perhaps more than any other film I've seen, ferociously challenges boundaries from the perspective of the viewer, and in the most pronounced fashion, to the kind of mass audience that it originally aimed to reach. Reflecting on this film recalls a book titled ""The Kindly Ones"", which falls under the same general discussion. It is a magnum opus of writing - a tour de force of imaginative and articulate literature, rife with beautiful crafted tropes and imagery. The controversy? It depicts in the most vividly brutal way the inexplicably awesome atrocities of Nazi Germany, giving a kind of physicality to the colossal horror we are generally familiar with but alien with respect to true intimacy.<br/><br/>Films like Salo are the kind of art that should exist, but does exist for no audience nonetheless. The production has a virtuosity to its despairing depictions - it is utterly bereft of redeeming qualities by design. It paints an insular picture of a truly nihilistic reality, where children are, as if by some right of passage, brought to an inescapable place to be instructed that the world exists not for them; a world where beauty, esteem, dreams, optimism, hope, love, security is categorically divested, replaced by insufferable psychological and psychical torture, at the hands of an inscrutable demonic abstraction. Pasolini depicts an abyss, a truly believable hell on earth, and not so ironically without gratuitous violence that many other films are assailed for - horror films are child's play compared to this.<br/><br/>With this, I cannot recommend it, but will not deny someone's desire and right to see Salo. Ultimately though in judging it, should man be intimate with the capacity for inhumanity that exists in this world, revealed in infrequent and unannounced times and places in history. Should I know what hell feels like even if others have? I can only say I made the decision to watch the film, so I must temper my revulsion because I thought I wanted to bear witness."
"Christiancrouse","Null","3","8","11 November 2001"," No doubt the most important film ever made
","SALO is not for everyone ... but everyone should see it.  As the past becomes history and studies in fascism and totalitarianism become more academic and more generic, we lose that sense of anger and horror that such ideologies should inspire in us all.  SALO captures the very essence of evil that fascism truly is.  After watching the events of organized chaos unfold in this film, no one will ever think of these movements the same way again.<br/><br/>
Adapting the plot of Sade's 18th century novel 120 Days of Sodom, Pasolini strikes deep at the heart of the viewer's sense of security by drawing them into a world of perversion and molestation.  He uses sex-as-metaphor to depict the atrocities of fascist mentality and ideology.  Sado-masochistic practices and pedophilism dominate this very raw and gritty film, perversions that culminate into one of the most horrific conclusions ever captured on film.  There is no where to hide, and Pasolini forces the observer to become an unwilling participant in his chateau of horrors. Nothing - sex, home, food, beauty - will be looked upon in the same way again after being introduced to his world of masters and slaves where religion, family and love are completely destroyed in the pursuit of sexual pleasure and power.<br/><br/>SALO has long been misunderstood, challenged by censorship, political and artistic narrow-mindedness, and fear.  It is, however, one of the most important films ever made.  As a work of art, it is a testament to Pasolini's genius. With its gritty and doom-laden atmosphere, created by its colourless cinematography and shadowed illumination, he creates a world with absolutely no hope, a vacuum existence that lives on death.  The air permeates with the very real presence of Evil.  Pasolini manipulates the senses - sight, smell, taste, touch - and locks the imagination in a prison of terror.  In these respects, it is a study in the endless possibilities of film as art.  More importantly, it is a powerful anti-fascist statement, ironically choosing a work of fiction to depict the brutal realities of human nature and the dark recesses that feed and is fed by fascist ideology.<br/><br/>
Defending Sade as an essential study to achieve a true Western education, Camille Paglia proclaimed that one must face the ugliness as well as the beautiful in life.  The same can be said in defense of Pasolini's SALO.  We must never lose the very real and raw emotions that fascism should inspire in us all, no matter how far we seem removed from its chapter in history. SALO encapsulates those frightening and monstrous emotions and preserves them for us all to experience.  It is the hope of the film to shock, terrify, and make the viewer wiser so the past will never again be repeated."

","Salo was a republic in Italy controlled by the fascists in 1944. Pier Pasolini takes a decidedly off color view of the war period.<br/><br/>A duke, a magistrate, a bishop, and the president come up with the idea to marry each others daughters. They also have nine women and nine men abducted and taken to a palace. Four middle aged prostitutes are added to the mix to tell erotic stories. <br/><br/>The four statesman escalate the humiliation and torture to the point of having one unfortunate woman eat the duke's feces, which is then served as dinner to other hapless victims. I am not making this up. The fun festivities continue with shootings, scalpings, brandings, and for the ultimate crowd pleaser, someone's tongue being cut out; now that's entertainment. <br/><br/>I am not easily offended., but Salo is just a pointless exercise in shock value.

","This film has been hyped for ages as being beyond grotesque and brilliant as well. I think it is neither. All but for the scene in which the girl eats the food full of nails seem rather scripted and orderly. There is no real sense of tension. What the film has to say about Fascism and power seems to be no different from any other text, it just takes longer to say it. It slow, and repetitive and just does nothing interesting, makes no new or insightful comments about the world it's deriding. Sure power corrupts, sure at the heights of dominance only the most perverse things can elicit any response, but what does that mean. What is the authors viewpoint other than ""This is bad, I do not like it"". He want to show us the horror's of the world, to make us see what we chose to ignore, but just showing us this world isn't enough. The scenes with the musician seem to try and give us that viewpoint, but never seem to go anywhere. I suggest ""Sweet Movie"" to anyone looking for something truly surreal and with actual content."

","One of the most controversial films in history, ""Salo"" was the last film of the famous Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini. The action takes place in Salo, a region north of fascist Italy in 1944. Four Italian officials gather 16 young people that meet the highest standards of beauty, and they go along with guards, servants and prostitutes in a house away from prying eyes where they are subjects to unimaginable torture and sexual practices. Movie born great controversy due to numerous acts of torture, and was banned in many countries, but many artists have stood up, saying the film's artistic merits.<br/><br/>I saw this film a few years ago and I got the courage to revisit. I think it takes a second viewing to realize that this movie is not really disgusting but it is a masterpiece in its own way. If you see a painting you do not like, which is something hideously ugly, eyesore then we say that the art of painting is not a good thing? Of course not, we like beautiful paintings but if one is unsuccessful does not mean we hate all painting and change our opinion about this art. So with this film is not for everyone but only for the kind of viewer who can look in the eyes of the director at what he wanted to say and not by what we see in reality.<br/><br/>After the death of Pasolini, Italy lost one of the best. His death remains a mystery but rumors say that he was beaten and then run over by a car. In fact, he said to some close friends that he would be killed by the mob. Other rumors say that he faked his own death. Anyway he had much to say, so let's value his last film that certainly will change you after you have watched."
"gav_walmsley","7","2","5","20 May 2011"," I leaned forward in disgust,, but in doing so it does its job
","As the name quite clearly suggests, this is not a family film. Banned for several years in several countries and being named one of the great 'video nasties' in cinematic history, Salo as one can imagine is quite rough.<br/><br/>Set in a post Mussollini Italy, four high powered, affluent Fascist libertines marry each others daughters and then retreat to a large home in the country where they sexually mentally and physically abuse and torture 18 teenage boys and girls (9 of each).<br/><br/>It is disgusting. I leaned forward in disgust. I felt guilty watching it because I could not stop thinking about how wrong what happens in the film is. It is graphic beyond all belief. But it does so for two reasons and those are its comments.<br/><br/>Firstly it comments on Fascism and further more Nazism. In doing so it shows the brutality of an authoritarian, totalitarian state as clearly seen in the holocaust. It degrades the human condition and the physical being so badly that it hurt to watch. Putting the teens on leashes and making them beg like dogs for food made me cringe. I think the film also makes a comment on post war effects, and how war degrades society. I think the film also makes a comment on the upper class, seeing as the libertines are all wealthy and highly powered and all of the teens/ victims are from the lower class, making a statement about self proclaimed superiority. Perhaps this is even an allusion to the Nazi's and the Jews? Self empowerment over a seemingly weaker or less dominant population? <br/><br/>The second is the degradation of sex. This is drawn from society's weakening conservative views on sex and what sex is and what it's meant to be. For example, no sex in the film is done in private and always in front of other people. Sexual contact is abrupt and without requited consent. All of the teens are almost completely nude throughout the entire movie, commenting on a lack of sexual conservation (from it being voluntary and being comfortable with it like in adult magazines, to forced and degrading). Sex is never done as an act of intimacy, purely to satisfy an impulsive desire (a comment on how society views sex and contextually suited to the emergence of pornography). No foreplay is ever conducted, degrading sex from something f intimacy and an expression of love to something done for the hell of i - intimate sex is punished with torture and death. All the teens are degarded physically by being challenged sexually e.g. being masturbated involuntarily or being made to bend over in a line to be judged on who has the best bottom). Sex is always sodomy, which in itself is 'impure' as such. The teens are all fondled sexually and forced to engage in sexual activity without mutual consent. Rape is conducted for pleasure. And lastly, sexual fetishes such as coprophagia (cosumption of feces which lasts for a good 15min in the film in the second chapter) shows us how society is degrading sex to a filthy and meaningless act, instead of being conducted sensually and intimately.<br/><br/>The final few scenes of torture some up quite well the brutality of a fascist regime and an abuse of power and ultimately the degradation of a selfish society whose values have been lost through destroying the meaning of what we find sacred.<br/><br/>It is not for children, and certainly most people will find it upsetting and repugnant. It is repulsive, and it crossed various lines that should never have been crossed, but for its cause it needed to break those barriers. It did a sterling job in carrying its commentary, and although disgusting, it shocks the audience into hopefully understanding what kind of a society we have become.<br/><br/>If you can stomach it, watch it. It is an important film and the after effects are somewhat less disgusting and more incredible than the content."
"galileo3","9","2","5","12 April 2009"," Pasolini's Salό is an ominous, abhorrent, intensely sadistic yet weirdly beautiful and sublime cinematic work...
","Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (1975)<br/><br/>Pier Paolo Pasolini's ultimate film is one of the most gruelling and disturbing films you are ever likely to see. It contains sadism, rough homosexual sex, rape, acts of cruelty, graphic violence, coprophagia and other obscenities. How can such an abhorrent motion picture be interpreted, understood, respected, appreciated? Firstly, Pasolini's picture gets credit for being a daring, mad outcry about life, society all processed in this tortuous film. Salò takes place in 1943-1944 in the miniature Fascist State established in the North of Italy by Benito Mussolini, after his retreat from Rome. The film's most evident undertone that I can notice is a graphic examination of how absolute power corrupts absolutely. 4 powerful Fascist Libertines make an agreement to go on an odyssey of debauchery, by seizing 18 good looking, healthy male and female teenagers and subjecting them to 120 days of mental, physical and sexual torture (120 Days of Sodom). The film is divided in three acts: 'Circle of Mania', 'Circle of Sh*t' and the 'Circle of Blood' - the film is increasingly unbearable to watch and as you watch this film you will wonder what its point is, if there is one, and you might be right to revile it. I felt shocked, disgusted, but intrigued by some of the strangely haunting qualities of this cruel motion picture, examining the potential infinity of human madness and savagery.<br/><br/>The film shows nudity, sex, rape and many other things, but not even for 1 second will you feel even remotely aroused. Pier Paolo Pasolini expertly films every sexual scene with a cold and ruthless detachment, opting for long shots in many scenes. Sex in this film is not the respectable union of two bodies, and the human body is not respected but rather 'consumed' by the despicable, amoral libertines.<br/><br/>This is a uniquely bizarre film. Many will not be able to bear it, others will be disgusted by it and perhaps they are justified. I saw something worthy in the whole picture, maybe I am wrong, but who cares film is so subjective, some films only cause reactions in some people that others would have never have thought of.<br/><br/>Perhaps a masterpiece, perhaps a vile piece of nonsense.

","I fancy myself as having an iron stomach, but had a very difficult time keeping my eyes open and not vomiting while watching this film.  Can I acknowledge that, within the morass of the physical barbarism and sexual perversion, lies a cautionary tale?  Absolutely.  Certainly, Pasolini has taken aristocratic frivolity and authoritarian entitlement to their most horrific extreme.  However, I could read A Tale of Two Cities and gotten that without having to watch the consumption of fecal matter.  In short, I would argue that Salo' is effective but superfluous.<br/><br/>Of course, many people watch this film out of morbid curiosity due to its reputation of being, as Criterion puts it, ""perhaps the most disturbing and disgusting film ever made.""  If you haven't seen Salo', I will say that I'll give Criterion the ""disgusting"" part of their claim.  That said, I was more disturbed Todd Solondz's Happiness, which, though graphic, does not show on film some of the darkest behavior committed by its principals.  A comparison between Happiness and Salo' reveals that what is understood but left to the imagination is often-times more disturbing than what is explicitly stated or shown.  The same point might be made of Schindler's list vs. Life is Beautiful.  <br/><br/>In summary, if you want to see the most disgusting film ever made, fork over the twenty bucks to buy a bootleg DVD on eBay and knock yourself out.

This movie does not talk to us about sexual violence, sadism, or anything we can see directly from the picture.

","Pier Paolo Pasolini really did his work well .. making this movie a 'corker' other than plain adrenaline push .. keep popping around and make something disturbing. Well folks, we've got a winner. And believe me, don't watch this while you are eating chocolate and orange marmalade!!! I got physically sick (retching) while watching certain scenes. I guess the only redeeming thing about this film is that it shows us a side of human nature that is best left unexplored. The evil that comes with absolute domination of other human beings was adequately portrayed in this film, to the point that I had to ask myself whether it was true that the excrement in the banquet sequence, as IMDb states, wasn't fabricated human turds based with Ciaro Syryp, fatty gums and a stabilizing base!?!?<br/><br/>The enigmatic Pasolini's final piece of work was quite the statement. Pasolini was man not afraid to bitch about things and did so rather grotesquely in Salo. An up-front film which was difficult to 'digest' and did seem have some underlying meaning. Pasolini successfully was able to show the harsh reality of living under a fascist regime and how it feels to be controlled. A fervent Marxist, Pasolini's DVD sells today at prices of over $70,000.00 USD!<br/><br/>Before watching this film you should be initiated into the weird world of De Sade's sicko practices, Dante's Inferno, as well as a basic understanding of Goeth and/or Schiller. If you lack any of these three elements, don't watch the movie because you just won't get it.<br/><br/>Again, don't watch this movie at face value. It is one of the dullest, most disturbing freakfests ever made, and it is made that way for two reasons. Not for shock value or to get banned in country after country, but to make a statement so dangerous that it is believed by many that Pasolini was assassinated (stabbed to death by a gay male prostitute) for distributing it in an Anti-American atmosphere. <br/><br/>Marks :<br/><br/>Story ... 18 for non-fans while 19.5 for Nazis ... <br/><br/>Editing ... 18.5 Sounds ... 14.0 Blurbs... 19.0 Stunts ... 17.5 Effects ... 10.5 <br/><br/>FINAL RULING : 18.5 out of 20<br/><br/>Comment : Women & Ebert mustn't watch ..."

This time, despite tenacious attempts to get through the whole thing, history repeated itself, I stopped after around an hour. Not that it was overly disturbing for my naïve little eyes to behold... it was truly a stupid movie with absolutely unconvincing performances. The premise is a bunch of teenagers whisked away to a distant location (away from the eyes of the law) by some fascist authority figures who have an obsession with butts. Thus, they have anal intercourse whenever the mood strikes, they eat excrement, and tell moronic stories about gluteal prowess as aphrodisiacs. Now, I'm trying to imagine a scenario in real life where this could actually happen. Nothing comes up. Pasolini has a unique talent for finding ugly actors for his movies, ugly actors with no talent, mind you (some of the girls were cute). Anyway, that's 2 strikes for this director in my book, I won't be looking for a third. I'd tell him to keep it up, but he's already dead."

He seems to be particularly obsessed with bodily functions that are best kept behind closed bathroom doors. It is not clear what the director's intentions are, but he certainly fails to convey any coherent message. The only thing that's clear is that this is the work of a sick mind.

","Pasolini's Salo is an absolutely horrifying film. It is not only disturbing, but disgusting and grotesque. There is barely any historical background for the film, only orgies, sex, and torture. The film is full of sickening scenes, such as the eating of s**t and the scalping and tongue-cutting of individuals. It is even more shocking, because these events really took place. The fascists of the republic of Salo were sadistic, but Pasolini's film is just too much. I don't really believe it should have been banned because people do have the right to express themselves. However, Salo is too difficult to watch. No wonder it was so controversial. One can hardly sit through the film. I don't even know what to really say about Salo, accept for that it truly bothered me. It was simply a film of young individuals being tortured in cruel ways. Passolini claims that he hates sexual organs and that no one should be afraid of being used by power and culture. Oddly enough, Passolini overtly uses culture and power to exploit sex and sexuality. I don't believe that Salo should be labeled as pornographic, for it is completely explicit, rather than stimulating or erotic. This film is genuinely repulsive and somewhat pointless in my opinion. Salo is literally ""The 120 days of Sodom."""

The most graphic thing about the movie, in fact, is the language, much of which was lifted from the original De Sade.  As to being anti-fascist, well, duh, of course it is.  Pasolini can't help but smear your face in it.  As usual, though, the visuals are striking and the color breathtaking.

Never watched it again though.<br/><br/>After I got married I wanted to watch it with my wife (she's even more insane than I am) and my DVD was in storage. So I downloaded a copy of this movie. Unfortunately it was in the original Italian WITHOUT subtitles. I figured I could do the translation on the go.<br/><br/>I could not. Got a few parts here and there, but no whole stories. At this point the movie ended up being just any old boring Italian movie. Not a lot happens. Yes there is the excrement eating scene, something to do with eating nails (I had remembered it as being broken glass which would be much worse), and of course the end bit which is indeed somewhat graphic. But when analyzed frame by frame, it turns out even most of this is suggestion.<br/><br/>What is suggested in this film is so horrible, that everyone who watches it remembers seeing it, even though they did not.

","Some films don't give you room to study their themes, their characters, their plots and stories, their artistic merit. Films like Salo are overshadowed by two simple questions: Who on earth made this? And for Christ's sake, why? While modern day critics enjoy jeering at what they refer to as ""torture porn"", films like Saw and Hostel often quoted as examples, they really need to get over themselves. They clearly haven't seen this repugnant, rancid and truly appalling work of supposed art.<br/><br/>Okay. To be fair, Pasolini had every right to make it. It isn't totally devoid of artistic merit. For example, the scenes that stick out in my mind - for the right reasons - are the shots of the beautifully made-up, bejewelled and coiffured women, dressed in furs. They gather in a luscious room of a palace and, while a pianist tickles the ivories, tip-toe gracefully around the room whilst recounting the most stomach-turning stories of sexual depravity you're ever likely to hear in a motion picture. It's quite a striking image.<br/><br/>However, pit those sort of scenes against the film as a whole. The seventeen young men and women who, for no particular reason, are forced into sexual slavery for a group of rich perverts. That these young men and women are seldom seen wearing clothes as they are raped, tortured, beaten, treated like dogs, fed needles, treated to a banquet of human feces. Seriously, do you still want to watch this? The artistic justification for this depravity is almost entirely absent.<br/><br/>""Oh, but it doesn't have to justify itself! It's meant to be shocking! It's meant to disturb you! It's about the darkest recesses of the human soul!"" I hear the critics cry. Honestly? I don't care. Salo is a nasty, nasty film that cannot wait to show you the next nasty act that promises to be even nastier than the last.

The final scene of torture seemed unworthy of the titles it had been given, especially as some were 'most disturbing film of all time'. I can see, however, how this would have been very controversial at the time it was made (and in some places probably still is). <br/><br/>The film itself was well made, the acting was decent continuously. Unfortunately the film has aged quite badly. Some of the effects were quite fake and dated, especially the tongue cutting, as you could see the 'tongue' stretching out.<br/><br/>Nevertheless I can see how this might affect the weaker stomached viewers, and if I hadn't been watching controversial films for about five years, it may have affected me. The scenes of coprophagia especially so. At that point, I did have to remind myself, several times, that what they were eating was simply chocolate.<br/><br/>The film is set out into four parts; the beginning, which shows the fascists choosing the teenagers, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of Sh*t and the Circle of Blood. Each part shows a further dive into depravity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film has aged so badly, much like The Exorcist or A Nightmare On Elm Street, that it is no longer as shocking as it once was.

The torture was really minimalistic, unless you would count the actual torture having to endure this too long and too boring movie. The stories made me sleepy. Quotes used in the movie were kind of pretentious, and really don't make it intelligent or artistic. Personally I'd prefer something like The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover or the excellent Clockwork Orange, which, although also kinda mild to modern standards, was definitely thought-provoking, intelligent, shocking and artistic. The score on Clockwork Orange was also very excellent.<br/><br/>Salò does have value as being a somewhat unique feature, so I'll probably keep it in my collection. I guess it's just one of those movies to see before you die. They did do a good job on atmosphere, but the acting could have been a lot better, as well as cinematography and overall set design/production. I also wouldn't have mind more narrative, as you were just sort of thrown into the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I had expected more.

","Widely considered to be the most grotesque movie ever made, this loose adaptation of De Sade's book is certainly one of the most disturbing and repulsive. While it may not be THE sickest movie ever made, it's in the running.<br/><br/>Updating De Sade's basic story to WWII Italy, SALO tells the story of four bourgeois fascist rulers who kidnap two dozen teenage boys and girls and put them through four months of physical and psychological torture until finally butchering them after every conceivable atrocity has been exhausted. The violence is tempered by tales of sado-masochistic sex, bestiality and scatology told by a middle aged prostitute to the delight of the perverted foursome.<br/><br/>The scenes of torture and humiliation are almost unwatchable: the kids are forced to abstain from bowel movements so their well-cooked feces can be consumed for dinner; the kids are made to walk around on all fours and eat from dog dishes; they are raped, sodomized and beaten; eyes are gouged out; tongues are ripped out; kids are eviscerated alive, etc., etc.<br/><br/>Pasolini's intention was to create an allegory equating the fascism in Italy under Mussolini to the sadism of De Sade's darkest fantasies. It's a nicely produced film, well shot and well performed, and it certainly packs a wallop. But the movie is so outrageously disgusting that whatever points Pasolini tries to make are drowned in his own excessiveness. The film winds up a freakshow with delusions of grandeur. It has developed a vigorous cult following, but as much for its sordid subject matter and gore as its loftier aspirations.<br/><br/>Basically, SALO is a political satire denouncing the inhumanity of fascist states led by sadistic megalomaniacs like Mussolini, Hitler and Stalin mixed with an over-the-top gross-out horror movie. It's interesting (if you have the stomach for it) and worth checking out for fans of bizarre/maverick/sick cinema.

They also fail to stamp their authority on even the pathetic debauched party they've thrown, with their captives disobeying their rules for reasons of comfort or defiance. The look on their faces as a prisoner they've caught in flagrante delicto gives them the fascist salute is priceless and their uncomprehending response one of the great moments in the film. Ignoring the fact that the party has been a bit of a flop or too lazy and drunk to care, they are made to look ridiculous dancing in nightgowns and dresses swinging bull whips in their own banal concept of decadence.<br/><br/>An obvious exaggeration and probably unfair, not to mention fantastically ideological and distressing, this is still a work of genius although Pasolini's belief that DeSade was a revolutionary now seems quaint."

I have recently been watching banned movies: 'Cannibal Holocaust', 'A Serbian Film', and most recently 'Salò'. These movies, all alike, have scenes displaying rape, murder, and torture. While I do believe a movie can be sickening and still contain a message like 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Movies like 'Salò' and 'A Serbian Film' exist purely to earn a reputation for most repugnant visuals. In my very honest opinion, 'Salò' is a very boring piece with mediocre acting.<br/><br/>I believe some people, not including myself, enjoyed this movie despite the unsettling scenes. Those people will say that this is a work of art, and try to create a deeper meaning to justify their enjoyment of the film. This is nothing more than speculation from me.

","The Italian director Pier Paolo Pasolini was known for controversial material, and the last film he directed was easily his most vile. Salo is a modern adaptation of the works of the Marquis de Sade. Set in Fascist Italy during World War II, Salo is the story of a group of perverted fascists who indulge in their demented desires and prey upon a panel of adolescents. They are stripped, dehumanized and told not to pray or engage in normal sexual urges. Violations of the rules result in swift and painful punishment followed by a cruel and prolonged execution. Pasolini has made this movie more of an homage to Sadism then he has in trying to condemn it as if he is attempting to show us visually how disgusting de Sade was in print. The Fascists engage in every perverted and disgusting manner that their imagination can bring forth. If Pasolini was trying to show us the sick parallel between de Sade and these fascists, he is relishing in their depravity than he is in trying to condemn them. The film is full of sodomy and rape, both heterosexual and homosexual. The audience is also subjected to such disgusting scenes as people being forced to eat cooked feces, razor blades and urinating on one another. We also see the prisoners praying on one another as each transgression leads them to their ultimate and final act of punishment. Whatever Pasolini is trying to say about fascists and de Sade is not clear, but Salo is so deep in its filth that we are forced almost to choke over its content. It is well filmed, and each scene of torture is shown in full color and shocking detail."
"carlvdl","9","1","2","28 January 2013"," An immense film
","First of all, don't pay any attention to those lunatics who think this film isn't disturbing enough to fulfill their desires for on screen violence. It's the very essence of disturbing, the very essence of not only perversion, but humans destroying other humans.<br/><br/>I won't go into the plot in any great detail, as it's been done hundreds of times before. Everyone going into this film basically knows the deal: as fascist rule in northern Italy comes to a close near the end of WWII, 8 bourgeois men and women kidnap a number of youths before using them for sexual gratification and sadomasochism. Why, simply, because they can.<br/><br/>The men, going by the names of President, Duke, Magistrate, etc, would be among the best film villains of all time, without question, neither being moral not immoral, simply amoral. The women are equally villainous, but do not participate directly in the violence, acting instead as storytellers, and recounting tales of debauchery with great verve and abandon, in a number of very entertaining sequences.<br/><br/>As the men peruse a group of boys for selection and one of them asks for mercy, one of the captors merely remarks: ""Don't expect me to be the one to deflower you"". Basically saying you might wish it was me, but it won't be necessarily. The fact that you'll be deflowered is of course well known to you, and of course it's also something you're hoping for. So viewers, the next time you're feeling small and helpless, maybe in front of your boss at work who's needling you over impossible to meet productivity targets, or a bully co worker, just harness that uncompromising ruthlessness and tell them (in your head): ""Don't expect ME to be the one to deflower you, could be me, could be the next guy for all I care. Whoever's turn it is... you know?"" Guaranteed to make your day better and put a grin on your face. Give the fascists a taste of their own medicine. Heck, even say it out loud, just expect to have a backup plan ;) There is a lot of metaphor in Salo. There is the infamous ""sh*t eating"", which could be construed as a metaphor for the excrement of consumerist culture/fast food, but probably is more along the lines of ""being kept in the dark and fed sh*t"", like mushrooms, as the peasants under a fascist regime. When the captors join in on the feast, it is much like them starting to consume, or believe, their own sh*t. The victims are also encouraged to snitch on each other to the authorities, much as in a fascism and war situation. Double standards are also enforced, no sexual intercourse being allowed between the victims, but of course sex between captor and victim is compulsory.<br/><br/>In the closing scene, each captor is given the chance to view the torture and executions of the victims, through binoculars, thereby being granted complete control, to watch or not to watch, to focus on one scene but not another, to still regard but be distant from the proceedings, to be spared whatever odors or blood spatter that may be present, and finally, no screams are heard, but in the background a wireless plays music and fascist propaganda. Reality altered to suit the captor's taste.<br/><br/>Two young guards, in a moment of boredom, switch the radio to jazz, and begin a dance. 'What's your girlfriend's name?' 'Margherita'.<br/><br/>Regardless of your personal opinion of Salo, it will be a great challenge to cast from your mind. More or less a once in a lifetime experience!"

From all the bad stuff I heard about it, when it came around to viewing time, I expected it to be much more shocking. As in violence the worst scene is near the end, with a young boy been being scalped, a much more graphic image, than the scalpings that took place in Inglorious Bastards. Here a group of teen boys and girls are rounded up, and are kept prisoners in this big house where they're subject to some pretty cruel treatment, one girl forced to eat a number two that one ruler has so generously disposed of. One of the older woman guards describes it as a delicacy, I really thought I needed an ear check. In another scene, in a dining room, everyone is eating it. Are you f...ing me, I thought to myself. We have a lot of nudity, especially with our young phillies, some who are forced to disrobe in front of these four men, controlling the show. Most of the violence takes place near the final, an earlier scene of violence has a girl being constant whipped by one of the rulers, merciless in his actions. Salo isn't for the disturbed but for the movie connoisseur, it's a must, it's last line of dialogue, weird for it's finish in a finally released masterpiece of shock."

Young men are imprisoned by wealthy aristocratic sadistic perverts. The youths are forced to act out the most inhuman sexual favors of their elderly leaders/fascists. These wealthy aristocrats mean the down and dirty business of sodomy, sexual humiliation and force fed feces<br/><br/>It is rumored that the director, Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered due to the films controversial theme. Based on the novel 120 Days of Sodom by the Marque De Sade. Beautiful score by Ennio Morricone. This is one of the few films ever to turn my bowels. A very unpleasant , but yet fascinating view.<br/><br/>Salo has been banned worldwide giving it the reputation as a ""Video Nasty"", even though it plays more like an ""Art House"" film.<br/><br/>If you are interested in rare film history, this is a one that will probably satisfy your needs. You don't have to be a sick pervert to watch this, just accept it for what Salo is, a true eyebrow lifter. That is the whole intention of this picture, to simply repulse the viewer in a sadistic manner. Salo is not a Horror film, but a shocking piece of cinematic history. It is unlike anything I have seen, and does not fail to shock after repeated viewing.<br/><br/>If Pasolini was murdered for this one, I guess we will never find out. This is a mere speculation that has been going on for the last decades. Anyways it is a well known fact that he was fond of little boys, so I guess we're better off without him, even though he did deliver some astonishing pictures. The Canterbury Tales, The Gospel according to Saint Mathew, A Thousand and one Nights ... etc.<br/><br/>Salo was previously released as a Criterion Collection DVD and is now available on Blu Ray.<br/><br/>Salo is probably the most controversial film ever made.

","I consider myself an open-minded and perhaps even jaded lover of film of all stripes but I must admit to being truly shocked at the depravity depicted before my eyes. I will not recount the horrors, they have been graphically documented elsewhere. My only purpose here is to discuss the film's purpose. Among other reviews I note those claiming it is a portrayal of Pasolini's disgust with the human condition and the ever increasing tendency for the world to conform to some arbitrary, abstract and dehumanizing norms of mass merchandising and appeal. Maybe so but other directors have done the same without assaulting one's senses so brutally. Given that, I am tempted to wonder if Pasolini and DeSade, whose writings inspired the film, were not kindred spirits. DeSade is usually thought to have been mentally unbalanced and in view of the fact that I am no expert I would hesitate to place Pasolini in the same group. Generally however, his films are somewhat disturbed if not disturbing and his final opus is by far the most outrageous. In the final analysis, for me the bottom line is this: was this film necessary? Perhaps not but then here it is, it's been done and we are faced with it just like DeSade's writings. If nothing else Pasolini and his crew should be credited with courage for this undertaking. I wonder what the actors and the others involved in this production would say?"

","After hearing all the notoriety surrounding this movie and seeing an article on it in the book ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"" I really wanted to see this movie. After seeing it I'm glad I've seen it but it's also left me quite shaken and speechless. Although it's nowhere near as violent as some people say, the scenes of sexual humiliation and s**t eating are a struggle to watch, as is the last 15 minutes. Despite an effective score and some beautiful camera-work the acting isn't great and the characters reactions to their tortures are somewhat non-existent. The message of the movie is quite obvious, Pier Paolo Pasolini takes a huge stab at fascism and how sadistic and inhumane it is. And he does do a good job with nailing the message home with brutal and unrelenting imagery.<br/><br/>The acts of sexual humiliation and rape unsettled and deeply disturbed me as they happened so often. The segment entitled ""Circle of S**t"" is also one of the sickest things I've ever seen and it made me feel physically sick. And the last 15 minutes packs a huge punch. Although some of it is hard to see, you CAN see it and it IS highly disgusting (there is burning of genitals, a scalping, an eye-gouging and a tongue slicing to name a few).<br/><br/>Reading the above may put you off but don't let it. All that is there to showcase how brutal humans can be when they have power. I probably could never watch this again but I can easily say this is a must see movie and is un-rightfully banned in many countries (included my own).To me, that is a sad and unfair injustice.<br/><br/>3/5"
"alw-5","7","1","2","4 February 2006"," A brutal masterpiece
","My elder brother once said to me, ""Andrew, don't ever see Salo"". He was profoundly shocked by the film, as any thinking person will be who gives up 90 minutes of their time to Pasolini's unblinking stare at moral depravity. I would not have understood the film then. What struck me, watching it for the first time a few days ago, was not the violence and obscenity - I was prepared for that - but the evident distaste Pasolini shows for his subject matter. He plays the role of the war photographer whose images become the conscience of the world. This documentary style allows him to exercise discretion in presenting the most horrific images, which are mercifully brief. The final, harrowing scenes are viewed through the lenses of a pair of binoculars, which forces the viewer to peer closely in order to see the horrors on show. Thus the director cleverly draws us into his hellish nightmare world of power and abuse. <br/><br/>I did not find it exploitative: it is too painful for that. Nor is it, as some have said, cold and heartless. There is a very strong moral core to this film, and for me Pasolini clearly feels the pain and anguish of the abused teenagers. My strongest reaction was intense sadness at the awfulness of human beings. We know that these atrocities have happened in every age, whether in the name of lust, religion or politics, and that nothing shown in this film is too revolting to be plausible and possible. Therein lies the real shock. By forcing us to hold a mirror up to humankind's dark soul Pasolini has done the world a great service. That this film could have been banned in the UK and Australia is itself a tribute to its raw power. <br/><br/>Comments added after a second viewing: Ultimately, the message of the film is one of hope, though it is only hinted at. There are several moments of real tenderness and love which illuminate the darkness of the captor's world. It is very significant that Pasolini ends on a note of gentleness and affection."

I happen to like the juxtaposition of beauty/ugly, love/hate, slap-stick/slap-stick {i.e. the marriage scene}etc. shown all too obviously throughout the film.

","Salo is a film with a reputation. Here in the UK, it has never been given a cinema or video certificate, and even the version shown in film clubs is heavily cut to avoid prosecution. But in the 24 years since it was made, is it still such a grotesque work?<br/><br/>The story is pretty simple - a group of Fascist men round up adolescents of both sexes, and enslave them in a large house, where much sordidness goes on. Cue the controversial scenes of sodomy, rape, torture, and more than a little toilet-related nastiness.<br/><br/>This is not a pleasant film at all, and time is unlikely to ever change that. The finished film supposedly owes more to Pasolini's personal tastes than the Marquis de Sade's source material, but we shall probably never know why, since Pasolini was murdered shortly after the film's release.<br/><br/>Yet for all the accusations of self-indulgence, there are still some redeeming features. The atmosphere is truly terrifying, and the evil on-screen infinitely intense. We are not given any particular explanation for the horrendous cruelty we are being forced to watch, and we wonder why no-one in the house rebels or tries to stop what is happening - the parallels with the film's war-time backdrop being all too apparent.<br/><br/>In the end, however, it is all a matter of taste. If you can stomach the vile scenes of s**t-eating and torture (most of which are not quite as explicit as imagined, especially with some of the effects looking a touch ropey these days) then why should you be prevented from seeing this film? You may find it all rather pointless, but the irony of this film being banned in 1999, in a country which played a key role in routing the Nazi menace, should not be lost upon us.<br/><br/>Was Pasolini an egotistical nut when he made this? Probably, but I suspect that the (perhaps unjustifiable) reaction which this film is still capable of arousing would have made him happy."

","Hey! Are you ready for a real sick & twisted laugh? Well.... Then let the tortures begin! <br/><br/>From munching away on poo (yum! yum!), to the absolute basest of humiliation and degradation imaginable, to utterly despicable, vicious and hateful behaviour beyond words, Salo has got to be one of the sickest and most twisted jokes ever played upon any movie-audience, ever. (Well, hey, you couldn't possibly expect me to take this film seriously, could you?) <br/><br/>And what makes Salo such an ultimately sick & twisted joke is that, even by today's standards of pure cinematic depravity (such as torture-porn), nothing as vile (in the past 40 years) as Salo has ever earned itself that exalted and privileged position of being called ""Art"", as this film has.<br/><br/>'Cause if ""Art"" is something that's deliberately intended to disgust and repulse (rather than illuminate and inspire), then, yes, with Salo, director Pier Pasolini certainly succeeded quite splendidly in his lofty mission by playing one of his dirtiest and most vile jokes on us all.<br/><br/>If nothing else, Salo was a very clear-cut statement of what Pasolini (who was gay) thought about homosexuality. In Salo he certainly managed to depict every aspect of this particular sexual preference as being the most perverted, repugnant and evil conduct ever enacted on the entire face of this wicked, wicked world.<br/><br/>After seeing Salo (and being treated to its own special brand of sick levity) one really wonders (had Pasolini not been murdered shortly after the completion of said-picture) what inspiring piece of sick & twisted cinematic ""Art"" this darling had next on his little agenda as a means to out-do Salo, as the ultimate twisted joke of all-time.<br/><br/>And, as a final slap-in-the-face (courtesy of Pasolini and his unsurpassed sick, little joke) the viewer will quite likely feel even more outraged that at the end of the story not even one of the perpetrators of these most heinous of crimes was subjected to even the slightest taste of any punishment, or pay back, for their abominable acts against their fellow man.<br/><br/>Ha! Ha! Ha! And that, I guess, is the funniest and most ""sick & twisted"" joke of all.<br/><br/>Yes, folks, when it comes to the likes of Salo - Filth is Art! (Ha! Now ain't that funny!?....

Probably because it's so honestly made. It's not necessarily made to shock but more as a study of humanity, in it's most extreme and disgusting way. It's a movie filled with physical, mental and sexual torture with some extreme sadomasochism and sadism in it. Not the most appealing themes all but the movie is powerful and effective with all of its themes, despite of it's high artistic value, that will make this movie hard to follow for people at times.<br/><br/>It's a very straight-forward movies, which also gave it the reputation as one of the most shocking movies ever made. It's straight-forward with all of its sexual content, which means it also features lots of frontal nudity. It has more psychological torture in it than physical really but the psychological torture moments feel more painful than any physical could had, at times. It isn't until the end that the physical torture starts to kick in as well, which is also pretty powerful at its own right. It also provides the movie with an unforgettable ending that will really make you feel uneasy. The movie is good at it to make you feel uneasy. It's a real 'dirty' movie to watch but very rewarding at the same time. <br/><br/>The biggest thing that will scare people off from watching this movie is its artistic approach. The dialogs are filled with poetry and all of the characters are walking around in the weirdest clothes at times. It's strange artistic atmosphere and style however really suits the movie and its unusual unique story.<br/><br/>Pier Paolo Pasolini handled all of its themes in a classy and powerful way. He obviously had an interest in all these themes and his life style did show some similarities to events and characters in this movie. This was the last movie he directed before his still mysterious murder, of which many different theories exist till this date. <br/><br/>Shocking and disgusting but powerful and appealing at the same time.

"The_Void","6","2","7","15 April 2008"," Arty and pointless, but it's a film you're not likely to forget in a hurry
","Salo has a reputation for being a sick piece of filth, and that reputation is more than justified. The Nazi's were one of the most despicable sets of people to ever walk the Earth, so it's not surprising that exploitation filmmakers picked up on this and created their own genre out of the party; the lamentable 'Nazisploitation'. This film takes elements such as torture and the grim tone of Nazisploitation, but uses it's budget to put a nice gloss on it and implements some good production values; and yet what we end up with is actually more shocking and distasteful (although slightly more worthwhile) than just about anything in the Nazisploitation genre. The plot is simple and pointless and takes place in Nazi-controlled Italy during 1944. A bunch of sadistic fascists round up a group of young people and subject them to 120 days of sexual torture, which mainly involves three women reciting various stories to them and them being forced to act it out. The film has three chapters, each one focusing on a different sleazy topic.<br/><br/>I've seen a fair bit of sick filth, and while this is perhaps not the sickest film I've ever seen, it's certainly up there and it's one of the few that has actually left a bad taste in my mouth after the final credits rolled. Anyone who sees this film will no doubt remember one sequence over all other, which features the lead players at a dinner table enjoying a meal made up of excrement. I have no idea what the point of this film is or even might be. With imagery so powerful, you would expect director Pier Paolo Pasolini to have something to say or something to make it all worthwhile, but if he has; it's buried deep under a pile of filth. I'd really be lying if I said I enjoyed this film on any level; it's extremely distasteful and unpleasant viewing that I wouldn't wish on anyone really. However, I'd hesitate to say that Salo is a bad film for reasons other than just the production values and arty style just because it is powerful and is not a film that anyone will forget in a hurry. Overall, I can't really give this film a recommendation, but I'm sure that most fans of filth will want to see it anyway just to see what the fuss is about. But definitely don't see it if you plan on eating anytime in the immediate aftermath!"

","Before watching ""Salò o le 12o diornate di Sodoma"" I heard many positive comments about it. Comments like ""the most gruesome movie ever made"", or ""too shocking for audiences"".

But if are objective, there are far, more dark and violent movies than this.<br/><br/>The fact that the movie shows nudity of young males makes it probably disturbing for some tastes but other than that, I can't see or understand really what's the hype about it. Also, violence against young people isn't for everybody's tastes but anyway it isn't shocking.<br/><br/>Time and older audiences are responsible for it's overrated status but still, this movie deserves a watch for it's historical content, and beautiful art direction.

","So two friends and I got together on Halloween night and watched Salo. We had been planning to see it for a while and decided it would be an appropriate time. <br/><br/>So, this movie is at once absolutely disgusting and psychologically significant. The exercise of power by the Fascists is an examination of the depravity of the human soul and how, if unchecked, such depravity manifests itself in unspeakable torture without shame or remorse. In fact, the most significant aspect of the movie is how pain and anguish are used as sexual stimulants by the men. <br/><br/>Some aspects I found interesting: <br/><br/>The whores tell their stories with great pride and vigor, and Salo is about the absolute removal of shame or restraint. <br/><br/>The scene where the children rat each other out to Mr. President is quite haunting in that the children are so psychologically destroyed and submissive that they can no longer even stand against their tormentors, instead trying to win favor.<br/><br/>The girls are at no point really used for traditional sexual gratification. Only the boys are engaged in any sort of ""Sexual"" acts, while the girls are left to physical humiliation with bodily fluids.<br/><br/>Overall, an important film to see once, but quite difficult to sit through at times."
"tonymurphylee","Null","2","7","15 September 2005"," A Well Made Film, but it's Very Redundant and inaccurate.
","*** out of ****<br/><br/>At first I didn't think too kindly of this film. I thought it wasn't done in a very managed and interesting way. I felt that even though the<br/><br/>point that it made was well done, I just didn't understand the shock of it. It didn't have any marginal impact and i thought that if it was more restrained, it would have worked better. But I have viewed the film several times since I first saw it and I now appreciate it for what it is.<br/><br/>This film was made by the brilliant Pier Paolo Pasolini and was based on the extremely sick novel by Marque De Sade, THE 120 DAYS OF SODEM. In Northern Italy, eight young boys and girls are captured by strange people. They are subjected to torture and mutilation. The boys and girls are graphically raped and beaten. They are force fed feces and are sexually abused and injured. Eventually the less satisfying ones are butchered.<br/><br/>It is depressing, and it is truly horrible to watch these innocent children exploited and destroyed. Their humiliation is as realistic and as strong as it can be. The film, when not showing sexual organs, feces, or gory nastiness, is beautiful. The parts in between all the weird and dreadful things were the parts i looked for in this film. They are far and few in between, but they are there.<br/><br/>I felt that the era of that time in Fascist Italy was accurately and realistically portrayed and was quite an interesting setting. The children are treated like sex objects and voodoo dolls. The scene where feces is consumed is ghastly, yes, but it wallows in excess so much that the viewer is more effected by it as they would normally be. The buildup to the end is quite intense, as are the quiet moments of horror.<br/><br/>As for the setting, I am a socialist and i have always wanted to learn about different kinds of eras in places like Germany, France, China, and Italy. This film's depictions on Fascism in Italy are surreal. The film is very much worth seeing. It has a certain style,or lack of, that makes the film feel like something very special.<br/><br/>The thing i didn't like about it the first time was that it didn't have an honest effect on me. I watched it, but not with an open mind. I only watched it because i was a fan of the director and thought to be impressed by the visuals and the story. Alas, this is different from his usual stuff in that the sexual content is not existent. There is only violence being done by human beings to other human beings. These are the kind of people who live like animals. They have no regrets, no feelings, no emotion, and no ability to choose anything other than what they want. That is why it is so hard to watch. An animal in some ways is better than a human because it does exactly what it is supposed to do and nothing else. The idea that a human can choose to live like an animal is wrong and inhumane.<br/><br/>The film doesn't exist just to be a shock film. It exists because the idea based around it and the concept of human hurting other humans is an easy story to craft, but it is hard to explore. I feel that the two films that do this the best are this film, SALO', and the 2003 Gus Van Sant film, ELEPHANT. In both films, we are presented with ideas as to why a human would want to hurt another human, but these films explore this idea with an open mind and an honest fearlessness to it. It doesn't matter that somebody chooses to hurt another human. The real question is, is that what they think they are supposed to be doing?<br/><br/>not rated but contains explicit violence, torture, and rape."

And I really don't understand what the point of this movie was, other than to gross everyone out and disturb their minds. If this movie was based on a true story, that'd be different, but it wasn't. It was just a terrible script written by someone who belongs in a mental hospital. We just watch these four a-holes and their little Army of jerks torture and terrorize the victims and treat them like dogs for two hours. <br/><br/>It was like the writer kept trying to one-up himself scene after scene. ""You think THAT was sick? Check THIS out!"" The reason that I kept watching was because I was waiting for the victims to stand up for themselves, make a plan to escape, someone to rescue them, etc. But that never happened. They were all killed in a courtyard massacre, and then the movie just ended. If all of the victims died, I AT LEAST wanted those four a-holes in charge to die too. I didn't care how, I just figured that the bad guys would get their just desserts, like in all other movies. But that didn't happen either. This was the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen.

","I've read The 120 Days of Sodom, gruesome, nasty, vile, yet so artistically written, it's erotic for being so wrong and awful. The Marquis DE Sade became infamous for such a book. In 1975, Pier Paolo Passolini took the book in his own hands and decided to make this book into a movie. A bad movie. I guess I'm one of those bitter book readers who can't stand their movie remakes, but I just couldn't stand it.<br/><br/>I am absolutely furious at the fact that this director turned the Marquis De Sade's masterpiece into a movie that featured more feces eating than Two Girls One Cup. The movie is broken up into three pieces, Circle of Obsession, Circle of Excrement, Circle of Blood. Circle of Obsession and Excrement go hand in hand, since this director clearly had an obsession with feces. I read that book, and I do not remember there being such a large amount of excrement to begin with. The Circle of Blood. Where? Okay, the only blood in this movie: Girl is murdered, guy gets whipped, woman bites into cake full of nails, woman gets scalped, guy gets eye popped out. Two people are even shot, one man has multiple shots in his torso, and you only see little holes, and a woman gets shot at point blank range in the face, and there's no TRACE of blood. However, two men making out with crap in their mouths, women sitting in a bucket full of mess, a whole feast of feces, a woman eating it off the floor, god knows what else, this director was clearly a poop fiend!<br/><br/>I'm not entirely bothered by it being a scat film, I don't care, I'm not a prude. What bothers me is the fact that this director took one of the most violent books in literary history and chopped out at least 90% of the violence. Now okay, we have some things some of you may want to sympathize with. The movie came out in 1975, a time when there wasn't a lot of violence in movies. Okay. Pier Paolo Pasolini should have known better than to make a movie based off an entirely violent book and almost completely ignore there was violence in it. Budget? You can't afford fake blood? He spent more money on poop eating, I don't want to hear he couldn't afford blood. Night of The Living Dead even improvised with chocolate syrup for crying out loud.<br/><br/>The end of 120 Days of Sodom ends in almost a slaughterhouse type of atmosphere, Salo ends with some .. peachy keen violence of whipping, candles, butt-sex, and hangings, oh, and two guys dancing. I'm sorry if this movie had any deeper value to it that the director wanted to portray, but if you're going to portray it, don't take a piece of history and rape it into a piece of crap, literally."

One close look at the film will show that it is about the misuse of power.Pasolini wanted to depict that when crooks and rogues acquire power,they invariably end up misusing it thereby endangering the entire human society.There are traces of autobiographical elements too as he must have seen many of such atrocities heaped on common people.It is true that this film is a controversial one but that should not be an excuse to disregard it.This is a film that must be seen by all and sundry in order to know how a wicked human mind functions."

The acting was borderline awful but, in actuality, this film shows influences of Italian Neo-realism so the acting may play into that.  On the positive side of things, this film was shot wonderfully.  Plenty of poetic long shots and excruciating close ups.

They are taken to a secluded castle in Italy during WWII where they hear a variety of perverted stories while their captures sexually and mentally abuse them.<br/><br/>Pier Paolo Pasolini would be murdered before the release of this, his final film and many still seem to think it wasn't a random murder. Many people believe that his politics had some higher ups order his murder but it's doubtful we'll ever know what the truth was. With that said, this final film of his is certainly unlike anything you're ever going to see as it's about as depraved, disgusting and depressing as you're going to get. I personally think SALO, OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM is a very good movie but it's hard to really recommend it to anyone.<br/><br/>Based on the work of Marquis de Sade, this film is about as disturbing as everything put to film. The real debate is rather this is some sort of serious art film with a message or is it just a cheap piece of exploitation that was meant to make you sick. I mean, certain horror movies are trashed for their disgusting scenes of violence and sexual brutality but how many movies are actually worse than this one? Not only do you get disgusting stories being told ranging from child rape to people being forced to eat poop but we have to see these things as well. This is a film that really works on the viewers mind so it's going to be up to that viewer whether they take it in as art or some sort of exploitation.<br/><br/>For my money, the film is a piece of art. I'm not going to say what the director was trying to do or say with the picture but to me this film works because it seems very real. It seems like you're really there watching these horrible events and the film really doesn't back down at anything. The stories are rather brutal and we get scenes of such sexual depravity that you can't help but be disturbed. There really isn't any style here because the camera just captures the horrors that are there. The performances are raw, realistic and just add to the horrors of the story.<br/><br/>Obviously, not everyone is going to be able to take this film and I really can't say I'd blame anyone for turning it off.

You can't fake it with this movie. You have to watch it through and you have to commit to it. I found it when I decided to do a different Halloween marathon and watch 'disturbing' movies instead of traditional scary ones. <br/><br/>This movie is disturbing because there is no sense. That's what makes it tragic too. It's not just about raping and defiling people or getting revenge. It's just about breaking them. And the film is all the more horrific because there is no salvation. For ANYONE. There is no last minute reprieve, no punishment for the 'villains', no plucky heroine surviving to go on to her inevitable revenge (I'm looking at you I Spit On Your Grave).<br/><br/>The entire movie is just torture and not just for the characters on the screen. I was tense for DAYS after watching this movie and I like to think I'm pretty jaded when it comes to films. <br/><br/>Why only 5 stars? Simple: That ending was s***. Granted, Hollywood has taught us to expect that moment of retribution when the hero wins the day and goes on to live happily ever after (Eh, kinda. Why is it they never do films about what the heroine has to go through to go back to a normal life?)<br/><br/>So yes, I've been brainwashed into thinking that the film doesn't end well unless there's a clear villain and he's defeated (or left for dead in a burning house). But it DOESN'T HAPPEN. The point is, I didn't like the ending. If I were writing the script for this, it would have ended MUCH differently. But I won't go into that. <br/><br/>It was a good movie, very hard to be comfortable watching and it really pushed my buttons. So I guess it was a better movie than I care to admit.

","Salo, or the 120 days of Sodom, is the most vile, depraved, morally vapid film that I have ever seen. But it is also one of the best.<br/><br/>It takes us as a viewer and plunges us into a world of extreme sexual deviants (the kind that other deviants are disgusted by) who abuse in various forms 18 young girls and boys. Rife with horrid displays of perversion and the sickening depths to which men (meant in the broad sense; implying humanity) can sink.<br/><br/>This film has stuck with me, and, I believe, will always stick with me. It will remain a constant. It has been compared to porn, but I can assure you it is anything but. When entering into a porno, you expect a certain level a graphicness, you expect some depravity, but at least in porn the actors pretend to enjoy what they are doing. There is some attempt to alleviate us in a sexual manner. Not so in Salo. In Salo, the camera nearly always remains removed from the action, at least 10 to 20 feet away from what we are viewing. I'll get back to that later.<br/><br/>Salo is, I believe, in it's essence a monster movie. The monsters here are clear, and they grow throughout the film: they are the four men (President, Duke, etc) who have taken these ""children"" (few appear to be older than 16 or 17) and subject them to sexual acts that will make you wretch, if not outright vomit. They are subjected to this rape, in addition to psychological, and spiritual torture. This is a movie void of any loving God. This becomes clearer and clearer as the young boy 'soldiers' that work for the Devilish four not only grow accustomed to the atrocities around them, but actively condone and encourage them, even joining in, or allowing themselves to become a part of them. And so the monster grows.<br/><br/>What is essential to the film is that we are removed. We are, in the beginning, just viewers. But as the film progresses we are more and more involved in the action. We feel that it will never end, which is gut-wrenching when we think of our humanity: as passive viewers, are we not as guilty as the four torturers? How can we go in this place that is outside or time and reason? We even see through their eyes to the ritualistic torture and murder of their slaves. How can I even say slaves? In the beginning a young blonde girl stands naked and weeps for her dead mother while her captor shouts about how aroused he is by her tears. She is frail, vulnerable, and he is excited and dominating. But by the end the captives have been so far stripped of signs of humanity that they might as well be mud, and I feel terrible for thinking that.<br/><br/>Speaking of humanity, I can only count five signs of it in the whole film: Once when one girl hugs another who ""can't go on"", again when the blonde girl cries, once more when a girl, mimicking Christ cries out in despair ""God, why have you forsaken us?"", another when a woman kills herself, unable to bear what she has witnessed, and lastly as two guards dance together and one mentions his girlfriend on the outside."

","Salo is not a movie your going to enjoy,its depressing sad and cruel.The first time i watched this movie i was just curious of what the whole concept of this film was, i just saw it briefly because i was young and it was impressing me, i said to myself wow what kind of animals would involve themselves in creating such explicit material.It made me feel sick although i was never impressed by anything this had a powerful impact on me and as i saw the last few minutes of this movie i literally felt blown away and this was just by browsing through it quickly. I even had really bad dreams that were connected to this movie, more than once, some of the imagery just couldn't go away,especially the finale part were the torture took place. Then a few years later i was reading reviews about it and wanted to see it properly and i did. It didn't effect me the same because by that time i had already watched a lot of brutal movies as a horror fan, but i still think off it as one of the most shocking and disturbing stuff thats out there.And if you ask me why i would just say that even the characters that were in power were creepy looking nasty bastards that looked like a bunch of perverted nuts playing with the emotions of there victims.and acted so convincing like happy sick sadistic psychotic humans that have nothing better to do but humiliate there victims through extremes where your not even sure if your doing the right thing by watching them get punished in such perverted ways, example eating there own feces,on there knees naked acting like dogs and begging invaded all there privacy,forced to act like worthless items. this has to be one of the most notorious movies ever made, not even fake snuff movies like august underground or cannibal holocaust come close to this.Nothing will ever make this movie look tame not even the most hardcore of film. And the answer is simple every part of salo had deep evil thought but other movies seem to try and push violence so much that it just becomes twisted but forgotten after some time. this is a journey into the depth of depravity that is portrayed in best way possible to ensure that you will be disgusted by what some people are capable of doing."

","So I finally watched 'Salo' - I have to say 'yuck', but why all the fuss? <br/><br/>It was bad, to be sure. Disgusting and sadistic. But then again, weren't the Nazi's & Italian fascists the same way back during WWII? Some of the 'experiments' that Nazi 'doctors' did to their captives were probably even worse than what is shown in 'Salo', but it's still a disgusting film. <br/><br/>Is it worth seeing? That's up to the individual, I guess. It's supposedly based on the Marquis de Sade, so it's not like it's anything new, in the literary sense. Over the years, people have claimed this film to be the worst (most hardcore/disturbing) thing they have ever seen, which of course makes one want to see it even more, to see what the hype is all about; and though it was brutal and sickening (the 'sh^t eating parts especially), there are probably worse/nastier films out there; perhaps even 'I Spit on Your Grave' or 'Mordum' is a little more brutal, besides the eyeball & tongue-cut scenes in 'Salo'.<br/><br/>It seems hard to believe that these were actors, because the 4 sadists, the men who seem to be getting off on the torture, seem to be getting into it in real life as well. As actors, they sure were convincing. Even the actors who played the victims, had to have had some bad experiences while shooting this film. Pasolini, the director, was killed/murdered soon after completing this film, and I couldn't help but wonder if he was ""assassinated"" for creating this film? Evidently not, but it was an interesting concept, being punished, for making such a sick movie. Would I recommend it? Probably not, but for the Italian film lover, it does have its' moments of classic film shots/execution. Worth seeing, as a film student might view an 'art film'. <br/><br/>For what it is, it is a 'Classic' - it just makes a big difference between what some people see as 'art', and what some see as 'trash'.<br/><br/>For its' Italian style, I give it an 8/10."

","The title of this movie is straight to the point. The film is about a group of Italian fascists who round up a group of young men and women, bring them to a mansion away from the rest of society, and basically do whatever their sick hearts want. There is everything from the eating of feces, walking people naked on leashes, and of course sodomy. As graphic and appalling as some of the scenes are, this film could have been a lot worse. Some of the dialogue here is excellent, bringing up some interesting conversations that have much to do with the story. It's basically a group of people who have unlimited power, playing out their twisted fantasies because they can without repercussions. Pasolini has some beautiful shots in this film as well.

","Here's the problem - Salo is not a ""great"" movie. The orgy-room sequences tend to seem repetitive, the ""plot"" is pretty much null (you know pretty early on what it's all about, then the rest is just acting and re-acting that out), and at times you may even find yourself laughing were you not to take it seriously (the cross-dressing wedding).<br/><br/>All that being said - WOW...this movie is easily the most initially impactful movie I've ever seen. Even more-so than say an 'Oldboy' or something like that - the kind of movie where afterwords you think, 'Wow...that's f'd up'...until you delve a little bit deeper and realize more of what's going on and the symbolism and then REALLY think, 'Wow...that's f'd up...'. The problem (and beauty) of 'Salo...' is is this art imitating life (WW2) or the other way around (Sade's novel)? In every way possible I want to not add this to my list of favorite movies just because were it not for the noted director, critical acclaim, notoriety and other extra's (having Ennio do your score doesn't exactly hurt) - it'd be easy to categorize this as a B-class exploitation film. Fortunately (or unfortunately) - it's so much more than that, and the sheer response of emotion you have from not merely looking but beginning to understand and then daring to look again makes Salo the most memorable movie I've seen in recent years...<br/><br/>An unfortunate masterpiece..."

","An eight has been given here simply because it is a film that will be forever in my mind. It has made me think, I would suppose about the depravity of humanity, and although this film is either an extremity of humanity or the actions in here are few and far between in society, I know that we all have our deprevations. <br/><br/>To start with, my mission at the moment, as I am sure a lot of people have done before is to hunt out the top 10 sickest films released. My reason for this is that I do liked to be shocked. Mainstream horrors are not really good enough although films that make me think about society or myself, those are truly the scariest. So after firstly watching Men behind the sun (A film disturbing in a different way), I ""settled"" down to Salo. Surely Salo is in a different league.<br/><br/>Throughout the film there is almost continuous nudity, mostly of young virgin's, who to say the least will end up being abused, mutilated, or even worse believe it or not, assimilated. And that is basically the film. Violence is prevalent throughout the film as is psychological and physical torture. You hear arguments for mainstream films about sexual content and violence being justified to get across the meaning of the film. Withough this content there would be no film. I read a previous report saying that the classification board had excelled themselves in allowing this film to be released. In my opinion, humble as it is, I think they have made a big mistake.<br/><br/>Unsettling and unnerving. I have achieved my mission to be shocked. If any film gets above this in my top 10 of sicko's I would be surprised but I will carry on trying. I will however not be watching it again. I need to add however, that it is probably one of the most artistic films I have ever watched."
"AdrianMessenger","8","1","3","23 October 2008"," Shocking, Serious Movie
","Much ink has been spilled over the excesses depicted in ""Salo, or The 120 Days of Sodom"" (1975), Italian writer/director Pier Paolo Pasolini's controversial screed about the evils of Fascism. The film's near-mythic reputation as the one of the most disturbing movies of all time has been fueled by the fact that it's damned hard to find, and remains banned in several countries.<br/><br/>The film is a mercifully abbreviated adaptation of Francois de Sade's (i.e., the Marquis de Sade) unfinished 1785 novel, ""The 120 Days of Sodom or The School of Licentiousness,"" which was written during Sade's imprisonment in the Bastille. The original novel was an elaborate celebration of pornographic depravity--the 18th century equivalent of a snuff film. The narrative detailed the scabrous exploits of four sexually omnivorous libertines who commit an unimaginable variety of perversions and atrocities. (The plot is too labyrinthine and unfocused for for me to recount here, however you can read the unexpurgated text at http://www.globusz.com/ebooks/120Days/.) Pasolini's film elevates the material by getting rid of the explicit pedophilia--a prominent element of Sade's novel--and transplanting the story from 18th century France to Fascist Italy in the 1940s, imbuing it with a kind of ham-fisted political legitimacy.<br/><br/>Does the film deserve its hellish reputation? Not really. Controversial as it is, Pasolini's ""Salo"" may be one of the most unjustifiably reviled films of all time. Shocking? You bet. Especially the scenes of (simulated) coprophagia. The film also contains a few fleeting flashes of gore near the end, however none of it rises to the level of the scourging scene in Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ."" ""Salo"" is certainly not for the kiddies, however it's no more offensive than anything by Herschell Gordon Lewis or Gaspar Noe. The protracted mutilations depicted in Lewis's ""The Gore Gore Girls"" (1972), for example, are far more horrific than anything in Pasolini's film; and Noe's ""Irreversible"" (2002) contains the lengthiest and most excruciating rape scene ever captured on film. (For sheer offensiveness, though, it's hard to top Swedish director Bo Arne Vibenius's ""Thriller--A Cruel Picture"" (1973), which depicts real sex acts, along with a nauseating shot of a scalpel slicing into the eyeball of an actual female cadaver.) I've seen other films far more offensive than ""Salo,"" such as Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"" (1980), in which a variety of live animals were butchered on camera for no purpose other than to engender shock; Bob Guccione's ""Caligula"" (1979) also comes to mind, a film that is less offensive perhaps for its graphic barbarism than its preposterous sets and baffling pointlessness. <br/><br/>Before I saw ""Salo,"" I expected to hate it. Having seen it, I find myself defending it. In spite of the shocking content, this is not a sleazy exploitation film, nor is it pornography. Pornography is designed to incite lust, whereas ""Salo"" has entirely the opposite effect. Regardless of whether one agrees with Pasolini's politics or his subject matter, this is a serious film, which, like many great works of art, was designed to enrage and provoke. Moreover, the film has some genuinely inspired moments. The seditious ""wedding"" sequence near the end is a visual and thematic masterpiece. <br/><br/>""Salo"" is not for the easily offended, however our world has changed dramatically since 1975, and Pasolini's make-believe depredations pale in comparison with the very real horrors and depravities accessible within a mouse-click or two on the Internet. We have become so inured to the horrific and the bizarre that what had once seemed scandalous now seems almost quaint. It's odd that films such as Vibenius's ""Thriller""--which contains shots of actual ejaculations and cadaver mutilations--are available on the shelves of the local Borders stores, while Pasolini's ""Salo"" (in which the sex and violence is completely fake) remains consigned to cinematic purgatory. The banishment seems a little misplaced."
"lingh0e","6","1","3","22 July 2007"," This film was nothing new
","Review after review I have read about this movie speaks about how thought provoking it was.<br/><br/>Keeping in mind that this movie was made in 1975... long before Larry Clark or Greg Araki or Todd Solondz... it was a pretty explicit movie. However, one thing that people tend to forget is that the source material, written by the Marquis de Sade, was almost 200 years old by the time the film was made. All Pasolini did was adapt it to a more modern time that we would be more capable of relating to. That doesn't really make it any more or less relevant than Baz Luhrman's version of Romeo & Juliet.<br/><br/>My point with this review: I didn't find the movie particularly ""shocking"" or ""disturbing"" or even ""though provoking"". I understand the social political points Pasolini was trying to make, I simply feel that his methods were too overdone. Like Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of The Christ"", it was overly gratuitous exploitation to pick at your most primal emotions. I think it takes far more talent and skill to utilize subtlety... something this film lacks (unless you count the straight forward photography).<br/><br/>I'm glad I saw this movie... really I am. I just don't think it deserves all the accolades it has received. I put it in the same league as movies like ""Kids"" or ""Nowhere""... movies that make a statement in the most obvious and apparent way possible."
"abrutus75","9","1","3","27 September 2006"," A Thought provoking film of both pleasure and pain
","What can I say about this movie, considering the story is based upon a literary classic that the almighty Marquie De Sade himself wrote. The original manuscript was written by the Marquis while imprisoned in the Bastille and was penned with his own excrement onto toilet paper. Even being locked up for his vile writing and physical perversions could not keep this genius incarcerated. It is a period piece set against the backdrop of Fascist Italy and not the mountains of France as the books background, but the story and characters ring true to the book. Our 4 heroes as they are referred to bring a band of children both boys and girls with 4 prostitutes, and helpful servants and the like to a château for 120 days of unadulterated pleasure and violence. The children have no idea how the whole thing breaks down into complete madness and butchery. I could not help but feel empathy for the young actors (some looking quite young) ""where did they get these actors to portray the kids"", the empty blank stares and lack of emotions made me feel, they seemed very helpless and almost surrendered to the inevitable truth that they weren't leaving there alive. By todays standards it would seem this movie is pedophilia on film, but it is much more. The movie forces the viewer to look inside himself and question his reasons for watching it. Brilliant character studies , the movie moves seamlessly through the story telling by the 4 prostitutes, and the 4 degradations that befall the children as the months roll by. Each month has a specific theme, and to see our heroes relish in the idea of creating the stories into real life fantasies is truly sickening and enlightening. The Marquis once commented the only thing that separates man from pigs is our free will, to deny our lusts and wishes makes us less than pigs. I have read the original book (which is still considered a banned book), and it is very long read at about 750 pages, the movie condenses the book but still retains its realism and message very well over to film. The abuse of power by those in control, and the abandoment of hope for the victims gives a real sense of dread, and to see those in power in turn lose control of their fates is a piece of cinematic pure gold. The version I saw was in Italian with American subtitles and no sound, which gives the viewer the feeling he is not only watching the movie, but almost a silent participant in whats going on, this only adds to unwashed realism Pausolini is reaching for. This movie is not for everybody ,as hard as it is to watch, it is as hard to look away also. I feel the directors work has achieved something even by todays standards, as thought provoking and unforgettable as any film out there. Love it or leave it, you won't forget Salo."
"neverandever","Null","1","3","27 September 2004"," ...what is evil what is good, choice is yours...
","The Salo(...) is a masterpiece not for its artistic achievements (so please, do not look for any), and especially not for its political statement, but for its allegory's simplicity. It is a keen AND plain work of analysis: first, there is nearly two hours of the one-dimensional, tasteless and colourless evil as understood by majority of the monotheistic god-loving mankind, which makes it an as objective a view of evil as humans can have (an objectivity-aspiring documenter he 'was'  PPP has always compared himself to the greatest men of art, such as Dante). The last and a very brief scene in the movie, showing two boys dance to some nice music then contradicts the entire movie. Yes, yes, boys, but remember that's normal in PPP's eyes (so much so about human detachment -- laughs at us PPP!). The last scene symbolises (in a true Italian-operetta manner) the good that is cautiously entering into the building, but only after all the fanfare are gone (symbolised by the organ/piano lady jumping from the window). The movie is filled with allusions to Catholicism: the building is divided into Dante-like circles, the entire movie is confined to a closed space just as our lives are to our beliefs, and so forth. But the most staggering thing is in the following. In this movie, the ratio between the duration of the evil that is portrayed so obviously that no one could possibly miss it or dual-interpret it, and the good (the hope!) as depicted by the last scene, compares roughly to that between the durations in history of the Christianity vs. Communism. Remember that we are talking 1970-ies here, and one director who is fully aware of all his fears, of his heritage, and his early childhood baggage (he uses all that freely as his weapons), but also aware of his end-life statement (choice). PPP has thus taken stand by becoming a pro-choice guy (or lady) in general, and there is nothing artistic about that, rather political. But then you knew this from the beginning as I already told you. The master is laughing at you (us) all seeing that he had made a perfect movie: ""- Catch the tail!"""
"Cherubin","7","1","3","6 July 2003"," a guilty pleasure in more ways than one
","After first reading about ""Salo"" on the internet, I thought that it would be like my worst  nightmare coming to life on film with innocent teenagers being defenseless against the worst tortures imaginable. Plotwise, that is obviously still the case but what keeps the film watchable is that most of the film is presented from the point of view of the Nazi torturers while the teenage victims are left undercharacterized. The Nazis, though all behaving similarly and hence being somewhat undercharacterized themselves, may very well rank as some of filmdom´s greatest villains simply due to their arrogance, which is pushed to extremely absurd limits. Indeed, most of what they do is relax in the highest state of luxury with no worry as to what will happen next while casually discussing various philosophies and cracking dirty jokes. However, when they feel  the hankering to enjoy the luxury of having innocent victims completely at their mercy, they just go off to see their teenage prisoners and in a state of complete calm, regardless of the victims´ hysterical protests,  force them to do whatever they want them to do just by being firm, which is usually some kind of sexual activity or feces eating (an activity the Nazis themselves  surprisingly enjoy, taking the traditional metaphor of evil being connected with feces to its most literal level) .  All this is actually quite funny because what is happening is so weird that it seems almost cartoonish. The horror increases a bit at the end as extreme acts of violence like the burning of and cutting off of limbs are finally more blatantly forced on the teenagers  than any of the previous orders. But by this point, the viewer is so lost in ""Salo""´s hallucinatory atmosphere that such acts do not even hit him or her as much as they are supposed to. One might even find his or her feelings of sadism being disturbingly appealed to. The teenage victims, who in an American movie would most likely utilize plenty of pathos and fire in their protests and probably even defeat the Nazis at the end through a ""prison riot"", are here rather resigned to their fate , only rebelling against them through a couple of smartmouthed remarks and secretly disobeying their orders, constantly just hoping that some stroke of fate will save them if they just play along. Though some lose their lives rather than stay prisoners any longer and although one girl  keeps crying to another girl that she ""just can´t take it anymore"", the basic attitude is so submissive that the victims don´t even complain much but just look tired, confused and submissive. The most obvious metaphor then is that if one does not rebel against fascism or dictatorships, they will keep wronging and injuring him or her with increasing severity. In such a scenario,  dying on one´s feet is better than living on one´s knees. However, if you are a ruler in such a system , you will probably have a superficially grand old time at the cost of renouncing your humanity and most of the things it should naturally abhor. Otherwise, with its grossout soft porn  and lack of strong plot, ""Salo"" is hardly a great movie but the above features definitely make it unique, fascinating and thought provoking."

But this is a movie about the horror of power when it starts to be abused by those in charge. So more than a movie about the Italian Fascism it's a movie about all the fascist forms of power(in Italy the same tortures fascist committed during fascism, were then committed by the communist partisans towards the end of the war, and not only against the black-shirts).<br/><br/>Anyway this is a movie with high political content and it must be praised for the courage of an author, Pasolini, who has always been an independent intellectual and especially in a country like Italy, where, if you don't ""belong"" to something(left or right) nobody will listen to you, many were the critics of his work and this explain why his best works are still underrated.

","I had read about Salo on a website called ""Truly disturbing films"" (I don't think it exists).  So when I saw it in a videostore, I naturally had to see how disturbing it is.<br/><br/>First, the good.  The cinematography is beautiful; gorgeous shot of interiors with good color, and spectacular outside scenes.  Second, the acting is rather impressive for such a disturbing film.  You believe the leaders of this ""camp"" are the most sick people on earth, and the poor adolescents are really suffering.  The production values are really first rate.<br/><br/>Now, for the disturbing.  Quite frankly, unless you are a cinema scholar and look for a deeper meaning in this film, this film is more a test of how sick can one get on film.  We are eased at first with the internment process of these teens, which almost reminds you of a Nazi selection process.  Then you are taken to the second fourth of the film, where we are shown scenes of rape, sodomy, molestation, and voyeurism, all set against a high class prostitute telling a story about how she became precocious at a young age. The 3rd quartile of the film is appropriately called ""Circle of S---"". Now we really start getting into the disgusting.  To show power, one of the leaders defecates on the floor and makes a poor naked girl eat the product with a spoon.  And if that is not enough, during a celebration of a homosexual marriage, the main dish is steamed excrement.  Again, this is set against another prostitutes telling a story about her past customers obsession with fecal matter.  And then, for the finale, we are subjected to some of the worst tortures put on film.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, as most of you can tell, I really couldn't find a poetic side to this; quite frankly, I thought it was an exercise in repulsiveness.  I give Pasolini lots of credit for filming the unfilmable; very few directors, if any, would graphically portray a work of Marquis de Sade, much less make it an adaptation for modern times.  And it is sad that people had to ban this kind of film, in the sense that freedom of speech, even when vile and disgusting, should not be banned; if we start with this, then where does the slippery slope end.  But from my personal point of view, if you are a cinema critic looking for a film to dissect, or if you just want to test your stomach, this is your film; otherwise, stay away"
"songbird-5","Null","1","3","18 May 2001"," stunning visuals, but shallow as commentary
","I am an admirer of Pasolini's work  -  in fact, I might list him as one of my favorite film-makers. I however do not see Salo as an inciteful work. The message is rather simplistic and a whitewash rather than enlightening: people who do bad things wallow in filth and disregard morality or religious compulsions. For someone part of a fascist order, high in the societal eschelon, it might be relatively easy to harm or degrade others while placing themselves on a higher order from those who are being victomized, but here, the fascists wallow in the filth themselves. The scene in this film where one of the fascist leaders makes a hapless girl eat his feces is harrowing, but the poignancy is negated when all the fascists themselves make a meal of the entire group's collected excrement (that is an amazing scene in it's own right though). 		The film is basically saying: ""fascists are bad"" and then paints them with the broad traits that a traditionalist may find strongly dissaproving: athiesm, prosititution, scatalogical fetichism,  homosexuality (ironic, since Pasolini himself was gay), etc.  -  it is a very puerile characterization, melodrama.  The fact is, many fascists in history and some of the most oppressive perpetrators of crimes against humanity stood for a code of traditional morality or were devotedly religious: Franco, Hitler, and the instigators of the Inquisition for example. Pasolini's films had gorgeous technical artistry and interesting character studies.  The brutality and scatology of Salo and some of his other films are repulsive but compelling and effectively assaultive rather than glib or desperate.  The narrative and themes of Salo however, are underbaked as none of his other films were."

It's funny to watch it now, on video, far from those times, made of flares, tight ugly shirts, odd hairdos, long bearded intellectuals, terrorism, and all drenched in a word: anti-fascism. It was used as salt and pepper, you could make films, write poems, books, plays, avant-garde theatre pieces of the most questionable taste, and as long at it could simply imply or openly refer to anti-fascist feelings and purposes, it was all right. That's why (not many seem to notice) the film is mostly known as Salo (where the fascist government of the R.S.I. was based) more than ""120 days of Sodom"". None of the facts are real, and as many other noticed in some previous comments, the ""play"" could be set as in Salo as New Zealand). But if you put some Black Shirts, SS and the like, or a wealthy man saying ""We Fascists..."", doing bad things then you have an anti-fascist film. It's an old trick in Italy. A cheap trick used even by other self-supposing Directors to sell lumpy films as ""epic events"". Bertolucci's Novecento, the work and the casting can show you the money you can get your hands on in Italy if you use Anti-fascism as keyword. And you bet Bertolucci had Salo in his mind, by thinking and making his Novecento. That was the anti-fascism of Seventies' Italy: total and totalitarian, neurotic, self-obsessed, self-indulgent, no need to be factual. This is Salo. Like other films of Pasolini, it had its typical tracts: lame camera work, flat dialogues, no depth in defining characters, poor acting (partly due to the rigid ways of Pasolini himself, many said...), nasty shots and post-production of an almost amateur-like level. But not a beautiful film was asked to Pasolini, rather a message. What's the message of Salo then? We are all bad, sadistic power greedy hypocrites? Or the Anti-fascist message, how bad and cruel Fascism was...? Or it just wanted to make us think (how original this one...)? Do we need all this really? If Yes, does this Salo teach us all this (and honestly did it ever, also in '75)? My answers: no one who has normal feelings and normal faculties of perception and a less-than-average power of observation can nowadays see in Salo an ""enlightingly frank disclosure of human nature"" as many seem to suggest. Unless you live in a glass bell, like many intellectuals.. No one knowing a bit of history Fascism and Anti-fascism in Italy can take seriously the ""anti-fascism"" of Salo. No one with a less-than-average contact to the real world can ever feel the need of Salo and the likes to make them think...<br/><br/>As I said at the beginning, now, after all those years, that climate has gone with its flares, and its rancid concoctions of cheap populistic ideology and boring third hand marxism are no longer polluting arts in the same measure as they used to. This makes the viewing of Salo interesting to me now. And my conclusions are that, well, by all my comprehension, after taking in consideration all the praises and all the interpretations that I could read form others (because my ones are, as you can guess, not impartial), I can just say that Salo is useless: just a sterile, cheap, unfactual, self-indulgent, pretentious piece of work. The fascinating thing of it now, is the same of an old Trash film, like those cheap horror and soft-porno-thrillers of the Seventies: under this light Salo its a collector item.<br/><br/>P.S. If you want to know Pasolini's contribution to social and cultural picture of his times, then read his books. Forget the films. You will probably see that the maybe unfair accusation moved against him, of putting his fantasies in his work, well, is not so wrong. But that's not what matters in the end..."

","I only could stomach the first hour of the film. From what I saw, I was truly repulsed. After researching the rest of the film, it turned out that I had made the right decision by not continuing to watch it because it only got worse. I understand Pasolini's need to make a statement and to make ""works so extreme that they become unacceptable even to the broadest minds of the new State"" (and congratulations he definitely accomplished that). However, the non stop graphic horrors was too much. The sexual, physical and mental torture was so shocking that the visual images stuck more than the overall theme. It is unnecessary to display these acts in such detail. It also was confusing how Pasolini tried to assert ""new-fascism"" through depicting old fascism. Overall, I think he was unsuccessful. He succeeded in making a film that is remembered for its disgusting orgies, brutal torture methods and overall repulsive scenes that follow each other one after another. The sensory scenes completely outweigh the obscure theme and for that reason, Salo is unworthy of any critical acclaim or praise."
"pniemeyer-47222","6","1","4","25 June 2019"," Watch it once
","Here it is, one of the most controversial and stomach-churning movies ever made. It's a political allegory in which several Italian fascists imprison a group of young people in a luxurious villa in the final months of World War II and subject them to the most inhumane torments you can inflict upon somebody. It's a bold and angry critique of the way that people who care about nothing except power will sacrifice all of their humanity in order to feel powerful, even when they know that this can't possibly last forever. But is it any good?<br/><br/>Well, kinda. Director Pier Paola Pasolini deserves credit for depicting sexual abuse and physical tortures in a way that never feels crass or exploitative. The pacing flags here and there, but all the same, it's hard to look away. However, Pasolini seems to have forgotten that however valid his political points may be, the point of film is still to tell a story. I didn't relate to any of the victims in the movie. I barely felt like i knew them at all. The performances are uniformly excellent (and the actors were certainly very brave for appearing in something like this), but the film basically just shows a bunch of cruel men torturing young people and forcing them to eat feces (the most infamous scene in the movie) and then just ends. That's it.<br/><br/>If you have a strong stomach, see it. I'm glad I watched this film but am still not sure I can say I enjoyed it. Maybe that's what Pasolini was going for. Who's right?"
"asda-man","3","1","4","25 October 2014"," The sickest film ever?
","In 1973 most audiences were fainting and having heart attacks over shockers such as, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Exorcist. Little did they know that two years later a little Italian film would pop out of the waters and stun the world to silence. Being the twisted chap that I am, I had of course heard a lot about Salo. If you look at anyone's list of disturbing films, then you're likely to see Salo right at the top. A film so shocking that upon its release, director Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered in very mysterious circumstances. Having read a lot about it, I put off seeing Salo. Who wants to see about the rape and torture of teenagers? Well, I suppose that curiosity got the better of me.<br/><br/>Salo isn't just about the mental and physical torture of young innocents, it just appears that way. The film is quite obviously one big political statement as four bored old fascists decide to use a bunch of young men and women for their own needs. These needs consist of the most depraved sexual acts you could think of. Salo's full to the brim with rape and sexual humiliation. By the end of it, rape feels like a natural occurrence, although it's still no easier to watch.<br/><br/>Some call it a masterpiece because of its political message; however I fail to see why. Whilst the film is very well made, with excellent directing and acting, there's no plot. I see the narrative of a film as being quite an important aspect. Salo is quite literally two hours of despicable depravity. There's nothing more to it than watching four old perverts perv over teenagers and finally kill them in the most horrific ways possible.<br/><br/>Contrary to popular belief, Salo is not gory. There are two moments of extreme gore at the end, but other than that the violence remains purely sexual. What makes the film so difficult to watch is that it's all real! It's like watching some sort of soft child porn film. The actors are clearly under eighteen, yet are completely naked in nearly all scenes and fondled by old men and women. It's extremely uncomfortable to watch. The constant explicit tales, which the old women tell, of paedophilia are also very disturbing to hear. Especially, as it's used as an opportunity to molest the children.<br/><br/>The film reaches its most disturbing peak during the chapter aptly named, ""Circle of s**t"". Parts in this chapter actually almost made me gag and is the hardest chapter to watch for me. Watching people being force fed poo is not my idea of entertainment. The fact that all the old fascists contently eat the poo makes the scene all the more disturbing. It has to be the most disturbing scene I've ever watched. I've seen poo being eaten before (not in real life, but in the Thai thriller, 13: Game of Death) but not in this much grotesque detail.<br/><br/>Who would've thought that the most disturbing film ever made would come out in 1975? If this film was made now, then there's no way that it would ever see the light of day, and I'm surprised it has been widely distributed now. Perhaps, Lars von Trier should do a remake? Or maybe we shouldn't give him ideas! Salo is by far the most disturbing film I've ever seen and I have zero intention in seeing it again. I'm bemused by the amount of critical praise this film receives. Even with the political message and excellent directing, you're still left with an overlong and perverted mess of a film with extremely little plot.<br/><br/>Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com"

I mean, it WAS the end of the war and teens joined the resistance.... Just hard to accept they would count them out off the bat.<br/><br/>2. I was told this was the most gruesome film in history. There were some parts that were pretty hard to watch (i.e. eating poop), but I think compared to modern gore flicks, it seemed pretty tame.<br/><br/>3.

I feel like, as I'm watching, that I should help them as opposed to just being an observer; otherwise you're just a voyeur, same as the four rich guys.<br/><br/>4. This has a profound political message, and I think that the director felt like he had to sort of kick you in the teeth to get the point across.

It's so over the top it's almost like a parody of torture flicks. I heard about it back in 2006 when someone mentioned a scene from it on an IMDb message board. Going on the film's message board, I looked at a few of the boards and read some of the ""Most Disturbing Scene?"" posts. Me being the curious soul I am, I decided to hunt down this movie. When I found a VHS copy, I rented it, and the whole time I was excited to watch it... and then I watched it.<br/><br/>No denying the torture scenes are well done. But other than that, this film is complete garbage. Apparently this movie was based on a book, and I have no plan to read it after feeling I had wasted money on this trash. The movie tries to spread across a political message and ends up totally failing.<br/><br/>Now I'm a sucker for disturbing stuff. But honestly, this movie almost made me fall asleep. Not only did the movie sit on its ass and rely on the torture scenes to get somewhere, the characters were flat and dull, I did NOT sympathize for any of the teens, and I actually found myself rooting for the bad guys, which is NOT a good sign. If that was the point of the film, it was not well done. The only film ever to get that rule right was Cannibal Holocaust.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the reason Cannibal Holocaust was brilliant is because of the irony. The cannibals weren't the villains.

"m-vinteuil","8","1","4","6 November 2008"," ""Iz nacht chocking""
","To call Salò ""shocking"" is to miss the point. Such a multifaceted, and fractured social/political document can't really be summarised at all, let alone with a one word dismissal. Catherine Breillat is wheeled out for a Salò DVD supplemental documentary, to comment on the infamous ""Circle of Blood"" scene. ""Iz nacht chocking... Iz beautiful"" is her appraisal. And when you understand this film, you will have to concede that she is right.<br/><br/>In adapting Marquis de Sade's The 120 Days of Sodom, Pasolini presents us with no sincere heroes or villains. His intentions were born of an almost paranoid delusional dissatisfaction with both the modern world, and his own previous films of the sexual purity of youth. The libertine captors offer many poetic reasons for their conceptual acts of cruelty and degradation, theoretically justifying a political stance. Becoming frustrated and unfulfilled by the extremity of their actions, none seem to be genuinely aroused by the sexual torture meted out. Which makes them just as much recipients of the torture as their victims. Bound by ritual and a self-defeating political dictum, and locked in a cycle of an impotent lust for power and domination.<br/><br/>The infamous ""Circle of Feces"" scene was a commentary on the societal acceptance of American junk food, which allegorically, is painfully more profound than Pasolini could have predicted. The manner in which the teenage guards take their role, some begrudgingly, others with gusto, will be familiar to those who have worked menial jobs in fast food. Forcing hysterical laughter at the libertine's jokes, showing no true allegiance or sympathy, they are every bit the teenage middle managers of contemporary society.<br/><br/>What elevates this film beyond glib far-left manifesto, are the nameless captives. One girl established at the start of the film as having recently lost her mother, seems on the surface to be an emotional focal point for the audience. However, her constant weeping provokes the least sympathy from her captors. And as she is often the first subjected to the humiliation, Pasolini's statement becomes clear: There is no room for reflection or self-pity. We are all locked in this inferno, and there is no way out other than death.<br/><br/>When death is dealt, it is unceremonious and certainly not noble. There is no way you can be prepped for this film. If you expect extremity, you will be disappointed by the slow pace. If you don't know what to expect, you will be upset. Salò is as unpleasant for us as voyeurs as it is for the tortured on screen. It was Pasolini's angry, jaded declaration that humanity is truly wretched. And his paradoxical, unromantic mourning of its loss."

This place of martyr - called by the director hell (the first part is titled antinferno means before hell) or even Sodom - bears similarity to the last part of the age of gold of Buñuel where a figure (that reminds me of Christ) is sodomizing a woman for 120 days and finally kills her (correct me if I'm wrong). Cruelly allegoric pasolini achieves to bear the viewer with a sense of extreme disgust and complete disappointment. Rather cynically comments on the darkest parts of human behavior and the nature of power. Allows the viewer to interpret it in various ways. Nevertheless pasolini's anarchic ideas in addition to his known sexual orientation could be a guideline to this story of violence, power and perversion.

If you think movies like ""Beyond the Darkness"" or ""Cannibal Holocaust"" are extreme in their unflincing portrayal of human savagery, give ""Salo"" a try.

The film presents a world (a castle where a handful of fascists have enlisted a group of youths as sex slaves) that is not pleasant, nor one the viewer would want to visit again, necessarily, but I found myself with an overwhelming appreciation of life itself once the film faded up white at the end.  Pasolini's directoral style is transfixing, even during the display of contemptible, tasteless acts; his writing, too (I'm sort of relieved to discover this film was based on the writings of the Marquis de Sade) is articulate and stimulating as it comes from the mouths of his unredeemable fascists.

","(18%) A very hard film to watch, and an even harder one to review. It is without a doubt one of the few films I've ever seen in which I've asked myself ""what the hell am I watching here?"" all the way through until the very bitter end. Many have called it a dark art film, many just a nasty piece of exploitation filth, well I think that it is a combination both, and if anything it leans more heavily towards exploitation as more people (including myself) have seen this simply because of its reputation and they just want to see exactly how far it goes rather than for its artistic merit (of which there is really not much to see). In all honesty nobody really needs to this this, it is a very horrible experience that only amounts to the message that fascism is awful (like we didn't already know). The film at times becomes unintentionally absurd beyond belief when between the horror a scene pops up involving the four fascist sadist bastards talking about philosophy. And it becomes clear that this is trying so hard to be something, but between the strong desire to shock it fails to be nothing more than just another one of those tasteless nazi exploitation flicks. There are some decent things about this though. The opening and closing music track is a cleaver use of score, the direction is solid along with the acting which is a little too real at times for its own good. But the films obsession with crap, and crap eating gets more tedious than anything else, and a good portion of the content is slow unentertaining nasty drivel that strongly feels like a the director just wanted to quench his desire to make a really repugnant sleazy stag film simply because he could.

","Director Pier Paolo Pasolini was murdered in mysterious circumstances following the completion of this notorious Italian / French film, which I found in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, this recommendation is the only reason I chose to watch it. Basically set in 1944, during the Nazi invasion of northern Italian, in the state of Salò, four wealthy dignitaries, The Duke (Paolo Bonacelli), The Bishop (Giorgio Cataldi), The Magistrate (Umberto Paolo Quintavalle) and The President (Aldo Valletti), have rounded up sixteen adolescent boys and girls and taken them to a palace near Marzabotto. They, along with guards, whores, servants and young soldiers (called ""cockmongers"", or ""f**kers""), are in this remote castle, to fulfil the unspeakably heinous fantasies of these men of power and their company, edited as four segments, inspired by Dante's Inferno: the Anteinferno, the Circle of Manias, the Circle of S**t and the Circle of Blood. Also entertaining the rich guests are three middle-aged women, Signora Castelli (Caterina Boratto), Signora Vaccari (Hélène Surgère) and Signora Maggi (Elsa De Giorgi), recounting arousing stories, accompanied with music by fourth middle-aged woman, The Pianist (Sonia Saviange), they do not leave any of the gory and disgusting details out. The acts carried out by the young people, and sometimes guests, include serving food and drinks naked, forced anal sex, forced marriage, fondling of bodies and genitals, rape, a threesome, forced acting like dogs including eating dog feet - some containing nails - and whipping for those who refuse, coprophagia - eating human feces, verbal abuse, defecating and forced eating of the excrement, masturbation, voyeurism and much more. The remaining victims to all this torture and humiliation are called out for punishment, as well as some of the guests who have been accused or caught for betrayal, all of them are sentenced to painful death, with various methods to do so, including branding, hanging, scalping, and having their tongues and eyes cut out, the Pianist commits suicide because of the grief, and the final shot sees two young soldiers, witnesses and collaborators to the atrocities, dancing a waltz. This is one of the most disgusting films I have ever seen, you are forced to watch and listen to the most vulgar and unbelievably horrible sexual deviance and bestial violence, no wonder this film has shocked so many people and been banned in many countries. But apparently it is not just made for the depraving material, it is meant as a political metaphor, with representations through the four Fascists - the law, the merchants, the aristocracy and the church, I agree with critics it is so devastating it in almost unwatchable, not even music by the great Ennio Morricone (the Dollars Spaghetti Western trilogy) can make me think that positive about this film, a very hard to watch but at the same intriguing political drama. Okay!"
"lenincloset1917","10","1","5","4 February 2014"," Lots of 18-year-old actors/actresses playing teenagers having to go around naked in front of each other and their captors.
","Well, you have to hand it to the Marquise DE Sade, he was the original ""Smooth Operator""! This film is worth a serious look at the first half, when it's just a bunch of 18-year-olds portraying DE Sade's 12-to-16-year-old victims. In the book, Sade indicates that the 18 victims, 9 boys, 9 girls, have been kidnapped from their homes, many ripped from their mothers' arms, right around the onset of puberty, which is when having to go around naked in mixed company would be the most abjectly mortifying. <br/><br/>Naturally, the actors and actresses couldn't be 12-15 years of age, so the went with fresh 18-year-olds. The young women have mostly A- and B-cup breasts and none of the males are very endowed. Beardless and smooth-chested, the only sign of sexual maturity is their thick forests of pubic hair into which their penises frequently seem to retreat. <br/><br/>In one of the opening scenes, a young woman is presented to the four ""Libertines"" fully-clothed, but the retired prostitute in charge of managing the hyper-modest nymphets lifts her blouse and bra above her breasts and pulls her skirt and pantaloons below her pubic hair and buttocks. <br/><br/>The next offering is a pitiable young girl, supposedly 16, who is lead naked down an elegant staircase and shoved, crying, into the room where the four men examine their quarry. I don't speak the Italian the film was shot in, but the woman is saying something about the lithe adolescent as if she was a horse at auction. <br/><br/>As she shutters and weeps in her naked embarrassment, her breasts jiggle, making her nudity even more enticing to gawk at, and they out right bounce a time or two when she collapses to her knees, thighs clenched around her most ""private"" parts but with the downy triangle of teenage pubic hair in full view. I don't know what she says, but I imagine something along the lines of ""Please don't look at me, sirs, this isn't decent. I'm only 16! May I PLEASE put my clothes back on?!""<br/><br/>Well, she is finally allowed to get dressed for the farcical ""Wedding Scene""; she's given a virginal white wedding gown despite the fact that her body has been violated prior to the special occasion. Likewise, the groom is afforded a temporary reprieve from the teenagers' required nudity. Before a congregation of 15 or so clothed adults, the couple apprehensively promenade down isle with their courtiers in tow. The 8 groomsmen and 8 bridesmaids are-what else?!-completely naked, 16 breasts and 8 penises swaying free; they have been giving flower bouquets to hold, rendering them unable to conceal their pubescent modesty. The nude girls and boys pout, hang their heads in shame and occasionally cover their ""private"" parts when an approaching adult makes them feel vulnerable. This goes on while the ""I Do"" s are recited and then, at what passes for ""the wedding reception"" the groomsmen and bridesmaids are suddenly set upon by the adults and In lieu of champagne and hors d'oeuvres, are groped squeezed in or near their most ""private"" body areas. The boys cover their penises and the girls cover their breasts and vaginas as they weep inconsolably.<br/><br/>In another fun scene, an evening meal of actual champagne and hors d'oeuvres is served to the unclothed debased teenagers but only when they show the proper appreciation. By ""proper appreciation"", I refer of course to barking and rising up on their haunches. Yes, supper tonight is marked by doggy-play. The 18 naked muppets are fitted with collars, leaches and choke-chains and are ordered to their hands and knees and to begin barking and woofing, ever the masters' loyal hounds! Then it's up the stairs to the atrium where dinner is thrown to them like beads from a Mardi Gras float. Walking up the stairs on all fours, barking like dogs, the perpetually nude youths are again a spectacle of bouncing breasts jiggling penises and youthful buttocks. Some of the lingering dorsal scenes of this amusing dinner-and-a-show show their firm assess and thighs splayed just enough to see the boys' recently-descended testicles and the girls' widening hips reveal their hairy vaginas from behind. I suddenly want to go out and buy some Purina Puppy Chow. <br/><br/>This is a great movie if you like seeing a mixed group of boys and girls having to go around naked, forbidden and/or prevented from covering their bodies while they're ""going through puberty""."

"brugo77","10","1","6","20 January 2013"," a masterpiece...Pasolini at his best
","I saw the uncut version of Salo' and i consider it a total masterpiece. It was the first movie of what the director intended to be a ""trilogy of death"" (following his precedent ""trilogy of life"" films) which tragically wasn't meant to be terminated, due to the brutal assassination of Pasolini shortly after the movie was completed. What i'll never be able to understand is: 1) the indignation of a lot of viewers, 2) the fact that this film is generally classified as ""erotic"" or almost ""pornographic"". I can address both aspects by saying that i don't understand how people cannot fail to see that this was not the intention of the director at all. He was a great thinker of the last century, he was able to see the crisis of a consumer society and the scariest aspect of a regime that calls itself democracy but that in fact limits the lives of individuals much more than a dictatorship does. Most viewers don't like the movie because they don't want to try to understand what the meaning pasolini wanted to transmit. He depicts what the power can reduce individuals to, he uses nudity not to shock but as a food for thought: one sees the brutal sexual acts in this movie and funnily he/she is not either aroused nor disgusted by them, 'cause it sees through what they symbolises. Pasolini wanted to make people reflect: we all have a dark side and people have to watch the movie without moral prejudices. The fact that your country has never lived an historical experience like Salo', which was hell on earth, doesn't keep you safe from that dark side. For a couple of hours put aside your morality and prejudices, watch Salo' and you'll be so glad you did. Probably Pasolini's best. I do regret he didn't have the time to continue his work and make other masterpieces like this."

But somehow this films lasting effect on me was worse than all of those put together. <br/><br/>I've kinda ignored this film, knew it existed but didn't feel like it was going to be exciting enough in comparison with others around. Then I saw people on the A Serbian Film IMDb quote Salo as being more disturbing. <br/><br/>To me Salo has an incredible cast who really put you on edge due to the fact these guys are just the human embodiment of evil. They really put over the fact they would do anything and everything to you to see pain and misery. The cross-eyed guy really unnerved me, a guy who let out cries of laughter at watching kids being whipped to death. <br/><br/>Although the victims in general didn't always act like they were under the oppression of the libertines, there was a point where I felt deeply sorry for them. They were treated like dogs and at any time were treated worse than sh*t, for no reason. It made me really uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Towards the end, I sensed the climax was going to be end in a lot of mayhem. What I did not expect though was it being the libertines to stand tall having watched the gruesome deaths of all the prisoners. <br/><br/>In the last five minutes the scenes of eye gouging, scalping, and burning whilst not particularly ""realistic"" just blew my mind. Maybe I was gullible to believe the victims were going to fight back, because the reality of it was there was to be no redemption. The poor kids in this film were slaughtered like pigs as that cross-eyed bastard giggled in his high chair with binoculars. <br/><br/>Wow, just wow. I'm interested that lots of people on here didn't like it or thought it was crap. To me the film did its job on me a million times (if you excuse the pun). I am still reeling from it. It's easy to become desensitised to blood and gore. This was about the depraved lunacy of those four libertines and them exploiting their power on innocent kids. <br/><br/>The only ""positive"" scene in this was the piano-player committing suicide, which is not really explained. I was under the impression she decided to die from being involved in such depravity. But even this did not deter the group one bit.<br/><br/>I'm really surprised the BBFC allowed this film uncut as there's plenty of scenes involving sexual abuse of children - were those kids supposed to be of ""mature"" age? I don't even know any more. <br/><br/>If you've seen the latest film to annoy the censors, give Salo a go. To me, this is the sickest of all time"

","In this movie you will understand what the term ""dehumanized"" really means. Just think about the horror that have happened to the Jews during WWII. How can someone do this to another man? Only if the victim is ""dehumanized"". The brutality is brought with so much ""civilization"" that it's even more disturbing. Their discussions on what they will do those kids are very formals and puts even more emphasis on this atrocity. But at least it shows you real pain. I think the director is also trying to show us that we have ""mental boundaries"". All of these are put into questions in the movie. What's right and wrong? What's your basis for right and wrong? How do you define right and wrong if you take away religion or the law (which are both subjective)? Society put those values into our heads and we are bound to believe that they are ""right"" and ""normal"" without ever questioning them. Why do some people like scatophilia? You can say that they are ""sick"" but sick compared to your ""values"", your taboos. They are no rule of nature that says that eating your own feces is wrong. It's all a mental construction that we are never questioning. After seeing this movie, you will realize that you are just an animal with fictitious walls that were put in your head since your birth. Those 4 mean come to ""experience"" their deepest and most awful desire. They represent society's ugliest pulsion. Those man are expressing their wildest emotions. Human emotions...without the boundaries that we are accustomed to. When they serve ""feces"" for diner perfectly illustrate that fact. They bring it like it's a real and savory dish served to fancy guests. Maybe if we had been told ""feces"" are good we would love it too. You have societies in which pedophilia (ancient Greece for example) was accepted and considered normal as well as incest (Incas, Egypt). Everything is just a matter of perspective and social construction. Those 4 men in the mansion created a new society with its own laws that other participant have to follow. In some society it's normal to kill your wife if she cheated on you or to eat insects and dogs. I believe this movie is just telling us that we are social objects and that right and wrong have no real basis in human nature. They are just constructions in our minds."
"dagonseve","3","1","6","18 April 2010"," Marquis de Sade
","Salò is an Italian film directed by Pier Paolo Pasolini – a man mysteriously murdered shortly before its release. The story takes place during World War II in a portion of Italy run by Fascists. The film is based on the book The 120 Days of Sodom by the Marquis de Sade – a controversial French aristocrat and novelist from the late 1700's who depicted sexually depraved themes of violence and blasphemy in some of his works. I've often drawn parallels to Clive Barker's material, particularly that of Hellraiser, to the Marquis's demented sense of fantasy.<br/><br/>The plot concerns 4 libertines who capture a group of young boys and girls and subject them to sexual humiliation, graphic violence, and sadism. Even though this was released in 1975, the outcome of this film is a brutal one – you cannot group this into the same sub-genre as the watered down Hollywood portrayal of acceptable violence. Everything is shown in graphic detail and no stone is left unturned: sodomy, urination, eye-gouging, and scalping are only a few things portrayed in this film. <br/><br/>There's a great deal of insight involved when considering Salò – especially that of its director. Pasolini was an artist and a poet. To understand the message of this film requires one to delve deeper into his life. Pasolini personally witnessed cruel acts at the hands of Fascist individuals during his time in the Republic of Salò.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, for someone who is unaware of the trials and tribulations of Pasolini's life, this film ends up being a terrific mess. Its whole purpose is to invoke human emotion and sympathy from the viewer. Although I don't rate this highly, I do commend it for its bravery. Its message is rendered ineffective on me because I cannot imagine what Fascist Italy was like during the 1940's. Also, I did not know Pasolini on a personal level to understand his torment. Salò is still banned outright in many countries, and although getting on in its years, still visually powerful. I will give credit where it's due but I refuse to be goaded into fanboyism based on the film's notoriety."

A woman reads out a perverse sexual story, which is then acted out on a member of the group. These depraved acts include rape, whippings and eating excrement.

"Stanley-Becker","Null","1","7","14 June 2011"," A warning to Humanity {Pier Paolo Pasolini}
","Because the themes and purview of this ""work of art"" are so visceral, so articulate, the imagination is not allowed much leeway. Does this film have several different meanings, say as allegory, or as a fable or even esoteric? No, the only meaning, I can discern, is literal. This is a movie driven by anger and revenge. Pasolini, had illustrated the ""Decameron"" like a renaissance Master in a painterly fashion. He then went on to make a slightly ludicrous Italianate ""Canterbury Tales"" {still amazingly beautiful}. Then, we get a shift of reference with Salo, where Bunuel's satirical style is appropriated by Pasolini and the culture of the bourgeoisie is brought under the spotlight. The text illustrated is the preparatory draft of 120 Days in Sodom by the pre- revolutionary aristocrat De Sade<br/><br/>De Sade wished to portray the orgiastic rites of the Pagan past with Decadent drollery and amuse himself in the confines of imprisonment in the Bastille with a teasing tale of the life of a man who is both free of legal obstruction and has the power to enslave victims in a pathological and brutal fashion. Pasolini, was well aware of the Danteesque depths that the Fascist/Nazi revolution had wreaked on the World Moral Order. He was ardently anti-Nazi and saw the corruption that absolute power had engendered in Mussolini's Italian version of the Nazi movement, centered at Salo, {Mussolini's HQ}.<br/><br/>It is not possible to believe with Pasolini that this aberrant behaviour was more closely bound up with Fascism than his beloved Communism {one has to reflect on the Gulags for that premise to evaporate}. Pasolini gives his story an Italian twist by evoking the Renaissance's proto-document, ""Dante's Inferno"". He breaks the film up into the ""Journey through Hell"", that Dante describes as circles through which the condemned travail.<br/><br/>What, of this distressing movie, where pleasure is distorted and perverted, so that the natural expectation of emotional catharsis is transformed into a form of corruption, ritual humiliations, repetitive torture, which appeals to a small minority of decadent and bored frigid cyphers, {symbols of power}. These men represent the aristocracy, the Church, the legal system and plutocracy. The stimulation of these powers, becomes more difficult, as the sex drive is transformed, into an opera of humiliations, and the infliction of sadistic enjoyment , as the novel experience is sought, in an exhausted cul de sac of isolated gratification. The question then revolves around, ""why did Pasolini make this movie?"" What purpose could it serve?<br/><br/>The tempo is unrelenting, as the fear and menace are intensified without any relief. The viewer has to be fit and alert, to give this movie its satirical edge. This abstraction, similar to Bunuel's approach, is necessary, in order to consider, the conservative lifestyles on display and the effect this has on a ""queering"" of the outlook on life. Pasolini proposes that the only emotions the protagonists possess is a defensive armouring against any feeling at all. The result, is the turning on its head, of the simple pleasures and the value of pain becomes paramount.<br/><br/>Everybody has a scene in the movie that epitomizes the most degraded evocation, in the history of story-telling. The scene that I thought was amazing, because it was a parody of one of the most commonplace scenarios in cinema - the romantic embrace - after the coprophagic wedding - where the couple embrace, he breathes heavily into her face. Both of their lips are covered in brown excrement. He says to her {lovingly}, ""I love the smell of sh*t"", they then kiss each other deeply and passionately.<br/><br/>The vagina as an erogenous zone is downgraded in this work, the rectum taking premier position. ""The Adoration of the Anus"", is clearly symbolized. The beauty of the buttocks is stressed ad infinitum, {a penchant of De Sade}.<br/><br/>This is an angry piece of art. Pasolini gives you human degradation that only the human animal is capable of. The capacity to be cruel is enhanced by the instruments of power. I learned nothing from this movie, except the awesome fact, that it is the swansong of a great artist, who lived a daring life, and died a reckless death. Pasolini's artistic power gives a sense of poetry to the life of perversion and sordid bestiality that is so extreme, that like some of Bunuels oeuvre, it will never be repeated. A nightmare played as opera, high screen values, well realized. An antidote to every ""feel good"" movie ever made. It is a cautionary tale, in the sense that the viewer is forced to be both abstract, and to take the human potential to perpetrate revolting acts, in a serious light. That must be Pasolini's reason for writing and directing this ""warning"" to humanity."
"semiotechlab-658-95444","10","1","7","12 February 2010"," ""This is my body which is for you"" (Cor. 1, 11, 24)
","There is hardly any movie who has attracted more (and more fantastical) interpretations than Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo"". Banned in practically the whole uncivilized world (in Switzerland, two years ago, a private person has been arrested when caught to have ordered a copy of this movie from Eastern Europe), one should primarily read the American commentaries, since they may be based on actual watching of the movie and not on scattered clips and rumors and written, already (mis-)interpreted documents available in books and internet.<br/><br/>What I present here is my own interpretation after having spent enormous thinking of this masterpiece during the last three decades (it appeared in 1975 but was not available to be watched immediately, except in Paris in the time when Pasolini was killed). In the letters to the Corinthians (1, 11), we read about Jesus: ""And when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, ""This is my body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of me."" The metaphorical or non-metaphorical interpretation of the loaf as ""Leib"" (body), in German the same basic word, cf. Russian Chleb, is, as most people know, responsible for the Schisma, the partition of Catholics and Protestants in the Christian church.<br/><br/>And now have a good look at the scene, where the young prisoners, boys and girls, are invited for the Ultima Cena (the Cenacolo): 1. There is a Trinity sitting at the head of the table (Duke - Bishop - Magistrate). 2. The table has exactly the shape of the medieval portrays of the Ultima Cena. 3. The young people have to eat the feces of the Trinity and drink their urine. It is so obvious, that the urine stands for the blood and the feces for ""my body, which is for you"", after all, feces is a body-product, it just stands at the end and not at the beginning of the digestion-chain.<br/><br/>Therefore, I highly doubt the many other interpretations presented in the (very well done) second disc to the new edition of ""Salo"", according to which, e.g., the feces stand for ""American fast food"" and other obvious nonsense. Pasolini has pointed out already in the fragment of ROGOPAG (with his friend Orson Welles) of the according to him special connection between food and crucification, giving the Ultima Cena and especially the Corpus Christi a quite new, yet highly original interpretation."

We are the toys, puppets, slaves or whatever you call, of our governments. We were young and innocent before we were poisoned by our parents and society. As in the movie, our families teach the rules of the society. They read aloud the rules of their home. They bring up us as a new slave of government the same as their own parents and theirs. As in the film they choose a life partner for us, they want us to have sex after the marriage-sex which was an evil thing before marriage. So that more slaves will be born for the government. When we are grown up enough, we have to work in order to earn money and feed. Government treat us as a dog, we eat whatever it gives-even a piece of bread with nails hidden in it. The film also shows inequality of men and women. In the competition scene, although it was impossible to distinguish the sex of people because of darkness, the physical features cannot hide itself. That's what men see, there was no woman to choose. Through the last scenes, Young are no more innocent and most of them accept the real rules. The real rule was: you do not have to obey the rules exactly as far as you are not against to the government. But do whatever you do secretly.. Also the religion is get what it deserves. It was banned because the masters do not feel bad conscience. See? The government create a god and a religion and millions of fairy tales. The point is make you obey the rules that written in the books or else you go to hell! and burn forever and ever! What will happen to the victims stay alive? They will be masters. They will be parents and society. They will have new victims obey the rules told by the government. What makes me irritate in this movie not the tortures or nudity, it is the real that we are the victims in our movies and we will be the heroes what the government tell as a erotic story to our parents. And it is too late for us.. Look all around the world, there are real wars and there will be much more and We, the victims will kill each other for the greediness of government.

"Prof-Hieronymos-Grost","10","1","7","3 October 2008"," A Masterclass in perversion
","As Allied forces began their final push to control Italy, a group of Fascist leaders in Salo, Northern Italy, (the last bastion of Nazism left in Italy) who knowing their time is limited, decide to bow out with a bang. Their plan is to kidnap local boys and girls, the sons and daughters of so called Communists in the community in order to subject them to the utmost degradation while at the same time satiating their own evil vices. The four main leaders gather at a palatial country house and draw up their perverted plan down to the utmost detail. The kidnapped youths are told that they can forget being rescued as their families believe they are dead, they are here to be degraded by those in authority and that they will be punished if they look at a member of the opposite sex and that anyone resorting to any religious activity will be executed. Each day the captives and their captors gather in the great hall where one of three mature ladies of ill repute, all Madames from local brothels, each take their turn to regale them with a detailed erotic tale from her past, this is designed to get everybody sexually aroused for the coming orgies. These youths initially show some rebellious traits, but these are quickly curtailed, as they are continually subjected to degradation, humiliation, debauchery and rape, but these are some of the lesser evils inflicted on them and by the end its difficult to tell the youths from their captors, as the rapists are themselves raped while in the midst of their dastardly deed, their hedonistic transformation complete. <br/><br/>Pasolini's most controversial film is loosely based on some equally controversial writings, Dante's Inferno and De Sade's incomplete 120 days of Sodom. The film echoes these writings and is split into three parts, The Circle of Manias, The Circle of *beep* and The Circle of Blood, with each subsequent section becoming more vile, although it's the second section, a sickening banquet, that will stand out and live long in the memories of all who lasted the pace. The final segment gathers a pace as the allied bombers become louder and the captors seek the ultimate satisfaction when all the hell of the ""Inferno"" is unleashed in a brutal final scene of sadism that is virtually a portmanteau of all the most gruesome scenes in Horror movie history, it's a scene that can leave no doubt in the viewers mind, that the captives are in the Hades/Hell of De Sade's imagination. <br/><br/>Pasolini's film has a justified reputation as a disturbing film and despite its exploitation excesses it is a remarkably well crafted film, exquisitely filmed by long time collaborator Tonino Delli Colli (perhaps best known as Leone's DP on Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il,). Each stark and sterile scene seems to have been framed with a geometric fervour and the continual bombardment of harsh and disturbing visuals is juxtaposed brilliantly against the beautifully simple piano arrangements and sumptuous strings of Ennio Morricone's orchestra. Pasolini takes up the story at De Sade's request where he had left off, De Sade in his unfinished book asking the reader to finish the story themselves and this Pasolini does with gusto and glee. Pasolini had long courted controversy in his career, touching on controversial subjects, being a homosexual and also a strong anti fascist, which is ironic because his father was a hero to the fascists, as he had once saved Benito Mussolini's life. He had long been scorned by the Catholic Church because of his lifestyle and beliefs but received somewhat of a reprieve from them after his film The Gospel According St Matthew was released, which the church surprisingly praised as a fine tribute to the man, but it wasn't long before he was back on controversial topics such as Salo. Sadly Pasolini for his troubles never actually lived to see Salo's official release as he was brutally murdered before hand, by a male prostitute amidst rumours of a Mafia hit. Pasolini's homosexuality is perhaps one of the reasons the film is labelled in some circles as nothing more than arty gay porn and yet there is also plenty of heterosexual content, so it's a moot point, but there are many gay scenes within and the film as a whole and it does have a preponderance towards, nay, a continuous homage towards the buttocks and anus, which are given an exalted position at the expense of both sexes genitalia, so if one is in anyway leaning towards homophobia this film should be given a miss. <br/><br/>The film is also noted by many critics as dull or boring, for my own part I found it riveting, as the film wastes no time in getting down to the dirty shocking deeds and continues to surprise and shock with every reel, a ""Filet de Cinema"". The film is a manifesto for perversion and evil and how under the right/wrong circumstances it could be brought out in us all."

A lot is depicted in the movie from the book but the book is more De Sade just ranting off sexually perverted scenarios. I think he wrote it from jail. He was obviously either very disturbed or very talented. My vote is for disturbed. I found the film interesting and repulsive. I couldn't stop watching it even though I was sickened by it. One thing I can say, is that movie will be collecting dust in my movie collection for some time. I will never watch it again! If you liked Salo, then try Man Behind the Sun. An equally disturbing film depicting the Japanese in WW II."

","I was told this was a classic film. As a classic, I expected it to be either aside from the mainstream or defining of a genre. It manages to be both, actually. It is definitely not mainstream, because of the subject portrayed and the way it is shown. It also defines a genre that is, also definitely, not part of the mainstream (somewhat, luckily).<br/><br/>""Salo"" is about a group of perverts (male and female) that exploits the Nazi-Fascist war machine to kidnap, torture and kill young people... And that's all. It has no plot, it's just a portrait. There is no character development, there is no story whatsoever and there is no point of anything for any reason.<br/><br/>There is a lot of background story (and History) behind the scenes, but not a single drop of it is put on screen. If an alien civilisation picked this film to watch, without knowing anything about WWII, they wouldn't understand anything shown (except, maybe, that the human species is one of the dumbest in the whole universe, eating their faeces and killing their youngsters for nothing, not even for the fun of it).<br/><br/>It's amazingly boring, slow paced and pointless in everything. The villains have no motivation other than sexual and murderous drive to act, and they act absolutely randomly along the whole film. Every time one of the victims die, they mock the survivors by counting them, making one believe that there will be some kind of ""whatever"" when the count goes down to one, but that never happens, as the film runtime just ends and everybody left is taken outside to be tortured and slaughtered. Considering that on the previous scenes the victims were forced to eat and bathe in faeces, I guess dying was actually a happy ending! It plays like a mockumentary or a stupid video clip. The acting is terrible, both on the villains' and on the victims' side, some of them can't even hide a smile while they are being oppressed (as there is no background story on screen, at first it made me think they were playing some kind of game, before the film's beginning).<br/><br/>And when you think it's finally over and that it cannot get any worse, the film cuts to two young Nazi soldiers, who join hands and start dancing... So, the message is, Nazis are are people, too, and can love (each other, at least) like everybody else does...?! ""Salo"" is not only boring, it's pretentious, amateurishly scripted and devoid of any enjoyable content, unless you are a hardcore fan of coprophagy (oh no, at least, it's fake)."

","When this film was finally able to be seen in a strictly limited release in Sydney at The Academy Twin Cinemas in Paddington (ah, memories), I made probably one of the worst decisions I ever made, in a long line of worst decisions ever made, mind you, to take a date with me to see it. Already a half established cinephile myself by that time, I knew everything one needed to know about it, its reputation, its maker and the supposed purpose it's maker intended. Blah blah. My date however had no such prior warning and as such, 'Gremlins' being probably the most mischievious and outrageous celluloid outing in his recent memory, I realized afterwards my choice of movie for the occasion was utterly inappropriate and irresponsible of me. Oh well. I vaguely remember his face as just a blank canvas, with his jaw hanging open for most of it and I can't remember if I apologized afterwards or not. If not for anything else, he inadvertently saw a landmark piece of cinema that he otherwise never would have. I'm not going to wax on about this movie however as it would just become more words, another opinion, more boredom concerning a film that will polarize people's worldviews until the next ice age anyway or worse case scenario. I can only say I enjoyed the film despite its queasy excesses and applauded its formalist muck rucking filth. This angry and passionate man had something to say and this is how he expressed it, in his chosen art form. His reasons and anger for me was infectious, hilarious and identifiable, even given the huge cultural, political and personal gulfs that would undoubtedly exist between myself and it's maker. I still look for ways in that I should label his film as exploitative, misled or pretentious but I'm afraid I cannot locate them. I think with a back catalogue of some of the most stunning films that I ever had to fortune to grow up on, it seems strange or more likely improbable that Pasolini would have waited for that long in his career just for the opportunity to make a disreputable or dishonest film. No way. I salute this filmmaker . A good man, who died for his art and perhaps for who he was as well.A consumate artist who just didn't have enough middle fingers during the the creation and making of this, his final film. God bless him. (!)"

","""Salò"" was directed by the notorious Italian poet, novelist, painter, and film-maker Pier Paolo Pasolini, who was murdered before it was released. The art house film was based on a work ""120 Days of Sodom"" by the notorious Marquis de Sade, to depict the short-lived, lakeside republic of Salo in Nazi-controlled Northern Italy at the close of WWII. There, four ruling fascist officials, in a secluded chateau near Marzabotto, rounded up a group of adolescent boys and girls and subjected them to one hundred and twenty days of physical, mental and sexual torture.<br/><br/>When I saw this movie for the first time, it was without competition, the single sickest movie I have ever seen. The movie is extremely disgusting, but it has something that made me see it through to the very end. Since then, I have seen much worse than that, but this one is the only of its kind that made me re-watch it a few more times. It is the most impressionable one in the long run.<br/><br/>6/10"

","Mr. Pasolini managed to encapsule an incredible ammount of deprativity and human destruction in an hour and 54 minutes. Aside from a few philosophical statements said by the libertines, I didn't really found any actual artistical or philosophical metaphors anywhere in the film. It is regarded by many as an ode to the grotesque nature of the human being, and oh boy they were right on that one. It hits the viewer with lots of shocking imagery and scenes, although someone who is already accustomed to this kind of entertainment will see nothing new. If you are looking for something that might stick with you for some time, I highly recommend watching this film. If you're looking for any real artistic aspects or philosophical statements, then look somewhere else. I don't think that eating human feaces and torturing people can be considered art, but then again, who am I to judge?"

","Poor quality sound and very dirty messy print. The transfer was not good either with film slipping and bad aspect ratio. Effects were generally pretty convincing - hope they weren't real. There was not a lot of thought or creativity involved. They just thought of the sickest things and made people do it. Most noticeable is the thought that people actually acted in this. This is impressive and bumps the score up a little. I've never seen anything like this made before it. I only watched the first half hour at normal speed, then sped it up to 1.5 speed. I got what was going on and didn't like it. This is all about humiliation, degradation and sodomy. There were also sex stories. The concept was pretty horrifying and harrowing. I didn't like it. Sick twisted and wrong - certainly not enjoyable."
"Rachmaninoff28","3","0","6","16 June 2018"," The discussion here is far more interesting and intellectual than the film itself!
","I don't believe art's role is to ""entertain"" (although it can do that) but to engage, stimulate, inspire, confront, challenge, etc. And it certainly doesn't have to be nice about it! If a work of art does any of those things for me (and, of course, this is highly subjective), then it works for me.<br/><br/>This is why I believe that Salò is very flimsy artistically. The craft of it, including the excruciatingly wooden acting and equally wooden script, simply weren't sufficient for me to ever suspend disbelief, and I was therefore never engaged by what was going on. There's no plot development, no journey, no character development, no emotional insight into characters. Nothing. Like its subject matter, the film itself is dehumanized. No doubt this was intentional, and its almost ""anti-art"" aspects are part of the film's ""art"" (for other people...), but its effect on me was that I was always aware that I was watching second-rate actors reading a second-rate script. And I just didn't care about any of it.<br/><br/>The shock value was kind of minimal, too. I came to this film already aware that it focuses on horrible depravity. I watched it and saw a depiction of horrible depravity. So what? It needed a framework to have meaning and, therefore, rise above the level of a splatter movie (but see below).<br/><br/>I don't believe Pasolini was commenting on Fascism or any -ism, but simply on the darkness within human beings and used that period of Italy's history as an appropriate context and pretext. I guess someone needed to make a film that showed this. It's been done now...<br/><br/>If there is artistic merit to this film, I believe it's because it's so open to interpretation: Pasolini shows us human depravity, leaving it up to us to make of it what we will, to bring our own frameworks with us to give it meaning. (Some people even see a criticism of fast food in the pooh-eating scenes!) How much of this was part of Pasolini's design, though, I have no idea. But as art, it's right up there with, say, putting a mutilated animal carcass on display in an art gallery and calling it, say, ""Installation 38b."" That's pretty shallow art. (And, in 2018, quite dated -- which is another criticism I have of this film. Good art doesn't date.)<br/><br/>The only real moral stand (and intellectual substance) I can find here is that by not providing a framework, Pasolini is rejecting the mind-control philosophy typical of the Fascists and other totalitarian regimes. Again, though, I'm not really engaged, stimulated, inspired, confronted, or challenged by that. But it is a nice idea."

","I too was torn between giving an eight and one star rating so somewhere in-between. Yes, the visuals are excessive, i.e. forcing people to eat fecal stuff (actually chocolate - phew); physical torture; full nudity (male & female); some sex including a bit out of the mainstream, but camera angles were such that nothing was shown (left to imagination, etc.). There actually was a thematic point to the film's visceral story, illustrated by the following comments: We see the relationship of power using sex to treat others like a commodity. The anarchy of power can be seen in fascism. Power can do what it wants, and what it wants is completely arbitrary. It is dictated by its eccentric needs which elude common logic. Power people are enamored with their own identity. 
For a film over 40 years old it strangely has some current applicability, i.e. I kept being reminded of a present day U.S. political leader."

","There are some good qualities about Salo:the opening (outdoor) scenes contained quite a bit of action and tension; the costumes were original and unique; the cinematography and music were excellent and set a sort of elegant tone, which contrasted starkly with all the cruel, perverse and disgusting proceedings.But ultimately, on a technical level, there is far more bad than good in this film.The adult antagonists ( the judge,the president,the bishop and the duke plus the madams and the pianist did a reasonably good acting job but the victims did a terrible job.It was as if, even when they were being yelled at and menaced they were indifferent or even laughing.The plot barely moves forward.It's basically a constant succession of scenes of torture and humiliation, and it quickly becomes monotonous and repetitive.There is some variation in that, at one point,several of the victims betray one another to try to save their own skins and occasionally the 4 men humiliate themselves.The scenes of torture near the end - in the circle of blood segment- are extremely grisly and hard to watch.Overall, I found this movie to be a somewhat interesting curio- very unique and unusual- but excessively vulgar, often sloppily executed and ultimately tedious and boring.The ending was one of the worst I have ever seen- abrupt and inconclusive."

Many people told me that this is the most messed up movie they've ever seen. I don't mean to brag but I've seen way worse. <br/><br/>The main reason why this movie never really managed to shock me was because of its inherently comical nature. As messed up as it was, every shocking scene was accompanied by a fair share of humorous remarks and some occasionally profound monologues. It was much more a comedy than anything else (especially if you have a dark sense of humor).<br/><br/>If you're a shock movie fanatic this is probably not the right movie for you.

","This film is a metaphor on Capitalism and Fascism. Four members of the ruling elite that represent both the government & church officials rule a château, where kidnapped young men and women are grotesquely exploited to provide degenerate, masochist entertainment for this ruling elite. Capitalism is projected as a degenerate system of arbitrary law. In the Capitalist world only those of the lower classes that completely obey its irrational and arbitrary rules survive.<br/><br/>The film is based upon the Marquis De Sade's novel, Salo. However, the ending of this film ends differently. In De Sade's novel, which I believe is important to state and doesn't give away the film's ending, but gives further thought to the film: The ruling elite are asked by a spectator why they acted as they did? Their response: By perpetuating unjust and cruel misery they were just reproducing God's rule on earth in their confines. After all, what is characteristic of the world is, but that it is full of unjust, immoral suffering. Please note, the film is extremely degenerate, graphic and revolting.

","Despite my rating, this is actually a well made film. It has high production values, decent acting, stunning sets, and great sound. In the technical aspects it is well directed. Regardless, it was one of the most tormenting films I've ever seen. It was such a struggle to get through. I was checking how much longer I had left like seventeen times a minute, because I just couldn't take it.<br/><br/>This is a film that's told smart, executed well, but the portrayal itself is horrible. Long story short, fascism is wrong, end of story. But like the Purge, it's not enough to just say it, we gotta go through a whole mess of stuff to show you why it is. Basically fascists sexually torture nine boys and nine girls for four months in a mansion. And we're talking urinating in mouths, eating poop, three way intercourse, ejaculating on each other etc. The whole film is literally just scene after scene of that. It's nonstop. All of that, as we constantly are forced to endure stories about people going through the same stuff, but enjoying it. This film loves to emphasize each character's feelings on each scene. When they eat poop, the film describes in detail everybody's experiences with eating poop, and why they are fine with it. In a strange sense, it's well told and has some interesting insight, but that does not make it any easier to watch.<br/><br/>Honestly though, the film as a whole is kind of boring. It really is just a matter of how shocking can we be. When it's not being depraved, it's just people in a room telling stories. There's really not much else to it.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that since it's on its own sick mindset, we as an audience aren't really on the same page, so we're just seeing random acts of violence, and not really anything else. There's no clear picture or goal the film projects, just that. David Lynch films do the same thing, but at least he gives us enough symbolism to let us know what to extract from the film. This one is just showing us that these people get off on this stuff, and that's it.<br/><br/>One thing I found interesting was how the perspective is of the fascists themselves instead of the victims. Instead of being a standard psychological thriller about escaping, it's simply just these fascist's sick perversions and their opinions on it. They're the main characters, and they're the ones we follow. I thought that was rather interesting.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, this is not one of the worst movies I've ever seen, but it's one of the hardest films I've ever had to sit through. It's pretty easy to hate this film. I don't hate it, but I would never want to watch this again, or would never recommend it to anybody ever. It's a well told film with an interesting insight, but it's way too hard to sit through and it's a one note theme that they just milk for an hour and 56 minutes."
"dfladger","4","0","4","18 September 2015"," Simply Numbing
","Im not going to discuss whether or not this film is unsettling, and to what degree and why. I will admit the direction of the film is evocative. Every sequence is shot with a disturbing impartiality. When this impartiality is juxtaposed against the extreme violence that is depicted, one cannot help but feel utterly surreal.Stylistically the director imposes upon the viewer an utter lack of empathy for what is happening to the characters in the film. But this is not, in my opinion a movie with a plot or compelling characters. It fails, at least in my view to disturb on an emotional level. We can't really connect with the victims because they act like objects. We don't even get a real sense of how they become so utterly objectified.They just saunter around the screen blankly, silently listening to the childish nihilism and tales of debauchery from their captors. <br/><br/>They do not behave like real people struggling to survive. Truthfully if this film is a metaphor how fascist violence is enabled by the willingness of society at large, why not see one of these victims descend, change into a monster similar to their captors for some possible advantage over the others or their own animalistic desires?<br/><br/>Really it is in the philosophical musings of these captors where this film really fails, really the film it could be nothing more than a discussion between them. How did these men become so, monstrous and why do they escalate their behavior other than for the sake of some point made during their discussions?<br/><br/>Really the film plays out like some disgusting and tawdry surrealist painting. Sure its making a larger point that much is clear, like all art their is some deeper intepretation that can applied.<br/><br/>But This movie didn't reach me on an emotional level. Like a lot of bad art that takes itself to seriously, it only made me cringe but I didn't feel anything for these two-dimensional charectars. And when a film, even one as heinous as this, has no emotional realism it is just to easy for me as viewer to remind myself ""Why should I care its only a movie?"""

What were they thinking? Or, were they thinking at all?<br/><br/>Torturing children and eating sh*t isn't entertainment for anyone; nor, is it of any historical value or of any enrichment to the world.

I leave it up to the viewer...but, anyone who finds this as entertainment needs years of therapy.<br/><br/>What EXACTLY is the purpose of this movie? What is the point?<br/><br/>To me, anyone who harms a child, a girl, a woman, or, a weaker person, or, even an animal, is a coward...and, an 'animal' and a bully themselves. This movie is full of cowards, animals, and, bullies who hurt the helpless...and, ""WHY?"" For what? Because their parents were once in the former government!?!?<br/><br/>This entire movie, although loosely based upon an old book written by a creepy sadomastic-freak...is built up by others who believe that this crap is worth filming for reasons other than for history. It's a catharsis for sadistic and coprophiliac sickos who believe that eating sh*t and torturing children is good.<br/><br/>Watch the movie ""Quills"" and you'll see the kind of person who wrote the book that this movie is loosely-based upon...Marquis de Sade. The French government placed him exactly where he belonged because he was considered a public menace due to his writings, behavior, and, activities. <br/><br/>This movie is a perverted torture and fecal-fest that can only be enjoyed by those who have a fetish for sh*t; torture; and, hurting children. However, I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel to this where the same things are being done to the captors.<br/><br/>I don't usually bother to leave negative reviews about movies or anything else, but, I feel that I was duped into watching this movie because of all of the other great film works-of-art this director made.<br/><br/>Pier Paolo Pasolini's 1975 murder was never solved. The authorities thought it may be the Mafia; Fascists (as Pasolini was a Communist); maybe even a Catholic who didn't like Pasolini as he was an atheist and gay; and, whomever else came into question. But, the movie ""Whoever Tells The Trust Shall Die"" (1981) never mentions that he may have been murdered because of this movie...alone!?!? This was the last movie he made, and, Pasolini was murdered that same year!?!?

In an era in which Susan Sontag has seen Marquis de Sade as an early free speech advocate, there had been no reasons to prevent Pier Paolo Pasolini from making a movie liked this. Therefore my question would be why he did it.<br/><br/>I see a couple of possible motives. The first is to show the realities of a tyrannical regime, but there had been other less revolting means to do that. The other is to create a movie that would be watched in specific ""afficionado"" circles. In that latter case the only thing separating Salò from your average SM movie is the quality of production. Or maybe Pier Paolo Pasolini simply told a story about himself."

","The most likely impulse is to dismiss this film as a second rate, cheap porn of bad taste. However if one indulges on that intuition and rate it simply as a viewing experience or aesthetic value, would not be doing this film much justice.<br/><br/>A bunch of fascists kidnap 18 young persons and subject them to the most degrading sexual, mental and physical abuse. <br/><br/>These men - through brute force - had the absolute freedom to do so and completely indulged in it. Their time in the village of orgies was spent entirely listening to arousing sexual stories, followed by living them on the young and beautiful captives.<br/><br/>By using Marquis De Sade's homonymous novel Pasolini uses this film as a vehicle to voice his own protest at how Italy of his day was becoming the captive of a tormenting and inexorable capitalism as a result of which the children of the country were chastised.<br/><br/>There is a sense of anarchy but this anarchy is carefully contained behind the walls of a villa. These sadists are both respectable to the outside world and refined. One moment in the movie that stands out is when one of the fascists says ""The only true anarchy is the anarchy of power"".<br/><br/>Another effective aspect of this film is that despite conveying the most successful representation of physical cruelty in the history of cinema, the purveyors of this cruelty are depicted as laughable figures. The element of satire in the film, cannot be understated. Despite their absolute power they are nothing more than a bunch of pitiful figures.<br/><br/>My criticism would be that it could have been made in a way that does not have a B- movie feel about it. Then again, it s possible that this was intentional as to not glamorise sadistic perverts?<br/><br/>This unusual, unsettling and often disturbing experience deserves to be seen, provoke and be discussed as to dissect its didactic element which potentially is enormous.<br/><br/>Kudos to Pasolini for pushing the boundaries of freedom in creative expression."

"DimitryVanLaere","5","0","1","20 November 2012"," RaTKiN's Movie Rants: SALO, OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM
","Sweet Jeebus Maximus, how I wish I wasn't so curious sometimes. After watching this movie, I felt the need to take a long shower. It's that filthy.<br/><br/>My brain tells me to give it some props for being a smart, well thought-out and nicely shot allegory on fascism (and in a broader sense on capitalism, in a way), with convincing performances overall. Pier Paolo Pasolini tells us fascism is an ugly ideology by showing us some truly nasty stuff. It feels like he's spitting out all his anguish, madly groaning and hissing like a wild rabies-infected animal. Not in the way he chooses to shoot it (in fact the cinematography stylistically conveys a sense of calm, aristocratic beauty, perversely contrasting the content), but in the actions portrayed. It's a pretty honest expression of pure hatred towards evil and corruption, to be fair, but nevertheless it's mainly quite demented. I guess you could say Pasolini seems to have stared too long into the abyss...<br/><br/>My heart on the other hand simply doesn't care about this movie, which is in a way purposely an overlong cinematic rape of its audience. I already kind of knew fascism is terrible (surprise, surprise, I went to school once upon a time), and therefore wasn't waiting for some kind of dissertation on the many different levels on which such an ideology is the cause and/or result of depraved minds. If you're interested in this movie's social and political commentaries, I urge you to read the wiki. I simply lack the will to think too much about this subject matter, in fear of suffering from extended episodes of gloom and/or emotional exhaustion. If you feel so inclined to accuse me of laziness because of this, then I will happily recommend you to watch this ""colorful"" film and henceforth be silent for all eternity. Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure this is the experimental film Alex DeLarge was forced to watch in A Clockwork Orange. Some kind of secret advance screening perhaps.<br/><br/>I guess the movie raises an interesting question: Is the honest balls-to-the-wall depiction of violence sicker than the toned-down dramatized violence aimed to entertain movie audiences? You can definitely spend some time debating this fascinating subject with your date on a romantic Friday night. But the real question you need to ask yourself is: Do you WANT to watch Pasolini visually showcase his feelings on consumerism, the abuse of power, corruption, fascism, etc.? If watching a large group of (continuously naked) under-aged characters eat a steaming pile of sh*t served on a huge silver platter, while some other young guy gets raped by Ed Gein's cross-eyed 50 year old lunatic brother, sounds tempting to you, then I guess you're going to have a blast. If that's not exactly your kind of sh*t and only reading about it already makes you feel uncomfortable, then know there's even worse things in there and that you should stay in a Disney-owned galaxy far, FAR away.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm fooling myself. What if the allegory and commentaries on society are just some kind of justification for Pasolini so he could visualize his nasty little fantasies? Judging from some forum threads, it might even be the kind of film creepy creeps from Creeptown watch in their murky little creep-holes. (At first one would suspect forum trolling, if it were only one person expressing his/her/its arousal by the film's content, but there seems to be a whole bunch of them.) Maybe I was an idiot for calling the movie ""an honest expression""? It's not impossible. Who knows? Who cares? Not me.<br/><br/>I will never see this explosion of hatred, perversion, decadence and excess again, and I would certainly NOT recommend it to anyone who isn't either VERY curious to a fault or just extremely passionate about film in general (like me). I don't say this because I can't stand being shocked by a movie, but simply because I do not see the point in rewatching this movie. It is simply too bleak, bitter and excruciatingly painful without offering very much else to warrant subsequent viewings.<br/><br/>Only for people who like burning unpleasant images into their retinae.<br/><br/>Ten little rats went into their underground creep-hole to watch SALO, 120 DAYS OF SODOM. How many of them came out with the contents of their stomach still in place? 4,9/10 ! (Just because I can.)"
"Rosser94","6","0","1","13 March 2012"," Brutal and twisted, however not entirely without substance
","I watched ""Salo"" purely because the controversy drew me in, as well as the fact that little else exists that can be deemed similar.<br/><br/>The brutality of the film, I expected. However, what I did not expect was to feel somewhat awkward in my viewing, as the uncivilised and inhumane portrayals of some of the characters in ""Salo"" made the whole thing difficult to comprehend. Also, the entire scenario was a bit difficult to consider realistic, which damaged the authenticity of the violence (for me, anyway).<br/><br/>In terms of the plot, pacing and acting - none of it is really relevant to the quality of the experience. ""Salo"" comprises of two key elements: brutality and controversy. When watching, there are a multitude of potential messages and suggestions (regarding both politics and human nature), that Pasolini could be attempting to convey on-screen; the movie undoubtedly forces you to become opinionated.<br/><br/>Yet, despite this, I felt that the brutality was not structured in an intelligent enough way to make it seem mindful, therefore I get the impression that some (not all) viewers who have claimed the film is a broad insight into the corruption that can stem from politics, may only be stating so in an attempt to either sound intelligent, or to raise controversy. In my view, ""Salo"" does not shock, it disgusts and puzzles the viewers, therefore any depth is only emphasised to those who enjoy excessive violence.<br/><br/>Overall, the depth of ""Salo"" and the intentions of Pasolini are both unclear and highly debatable, however this movie is unlike anything you have seen before and despite low production values and a difficulty to see intelligence or anything relate-able beneath the brutality, it is perhaps worth your time for that reason alone."
"RainDogJr","Null","0","1","3 January 2012"," Mangia! Mangia!
","Has anyone ever recommended you Pier Paolo Pasolini's very last film? I mean, recommended it to you personally? I think it's very unlikely to know someone who is an actual fan of SALO, OR THE 120 DAYS OF SODOM. I don't know anyone, and I really can't recommend it myself. I think it's the kind of picture that anyone who watches it nowadays was brought to it by themselves, thanks to all of the commentaries that it has generated. In other words, it is the kind of film that anyone with a respectable interest in cinema will watch at some point. Hell, there's even good history about its home-video releases (apparently the very first edition that the Criterion Collection released is one of the most rare, and so expensive, DVDs around). I know about ""Salo"" since years ago, even own a R4 DVD of it since years ago. But somehow I always wanted to see it on a Criterion release. I mean, I HAD to check it out at some point no matter what and last Christmas I finally got the Criterion Blu-Ray of it.<br/><br/>First of all, I must point out that this is perhaps the most stunning Criterion I have seen to date. The quality of the image is simply fantastic! Watching images of the film from some of the bonus features (that certainly are not in HD) makes you see the incredible difference it is Blu-Ray paradise, and perhaps, in general terms, that's the best thing about the actual film. Near the beginning there's an image that looks just like a painting. It is quite known that Pasolini always wanted that and he truly succeeded. Second, I'm pretty much always interested in anything related with WWII and so in a way I always wanted to check out that element in ""Salo"" (which is set in 1944-1945, in the Republic of Salo aka Nazi-Occupied Italy). I knew all the criticism, which is greatly resumed in the back of the Criterion box: ""the notorious final film from Pasolini has been called nauseating, shocking, depraved, pornographic"". But I thought this was closer to a great critic to fascism than to all of that. But, it is? The answer for me is both yes and no. <br/><br/>Finding similitude in everything that happen in the book ""The 120 Days of Sodom"" by the Marquis de Sade (I haven't read it nor anything by the Marquis de Sade though) to the stuff the fascists did is certainly a great starting point. At the beginning it captures greatly the horrors, as we see kids put away from their lives and the ""nobody knows you're here since for the world you're already dead"" thing, once the kids are locked up for the pleasures of, especially, four sick fascists -I guess that's just a pleonasm- (almost at the very beginning the marry each other's daughters, so you can tell!). But then is just the show of these four men. There isn't much about the victims; we don't get to know much about any of them aside of little details, like, for instance, we know there's a blonde girl who suffered the lost of her mother. But, and like I said, ""Salo"" is mainly just the show of the four main characters, who do nothing but give sexual, mental and physical torture. At some point of all of this makes us forget that this is set during the time of the Nazi occupation in Italy; there's a scene in which one the men (the ""president"" played by Aldo Valletti) puts his pants down and stars showing his ass to everyone to later implore for anal sex. Later you have the four men dressed with women's clothes! ""Salo"" is ridiculously funny at times. <br/><br/>I'm thinking a lot in a 2008 French film. It's a brutal one and it's called MARTYRS. The main relation between that one and ""Salo"" is that both deal with people of power who torture their victims for pleasure. As pure horror (torture) cinema, ""Salo"" ain't as great as some others, like that French one for instance. And in the end, Pasolini's film is much closer to be pure horror than to be a great statement on Fascist Italy. I remember being really disturbed with MARTYRS (and believe me: I'm not an easy target!) not only because of the shocking scenes but also, and mostly, because of the entire story behind, the story behind the people of power. With ""Salo"" I would have preferred something like that."

","When I first watched this movie, I really liked it. I gave it an 8. I liked the pointless violence and torture and I enjoyed the intensity of certain scenes, That's exactly the reason I watched this movie. It fascinated me so much, I decided to read the book. The more I thought about it, though, and the more I watched it, the more I realized it's actually nothing special. With each viewing, the focus turns to the flaws more and more. It could have been more graphic. The acting and camera could've been better. Maybe it was acceptable then, but by today's standards, it just isn't enough. So, the rating dropped to 7. It still was moderately fun and yet had a message and a point (even if that's not why you're watching it.) What made me think even lower of this movie was the book. Maybe it's unfair to compare them, but this movie certainly doesn't do justice to the book. Everything is watered down. The violence, torture, sickness of the libertines...There isn't as much excitement in the movie, the characters are not explored/developed at all, and the whole feeling of the book isn't rightfully captured. Even though the novel was never finished, and the events for the last 3 parts are just named, it's enough to picture and and leave you satisfied. On the other hand, the movie always leaves you waiting for more, but more never comes. Also, the movie may make some minor point, it might have some message to send, but it pales in comparison with what de Sade put into his novel. Of course, maybe it should be compared, books are a different form of art, but still, books rarely make me realize how many flaws a movie has.<br/><br/>In general, this movie is worth your time and data traffic, but don't expect a masterpiece. It won't be the most disgusting and disturbing movie you've ever seen, it won't be the most entertaining, it won't be the most intelligent and meaningful. But at the same time it's not pointless nor completely boring. Even though it doesn't deserve all the hype it gets, it is a pretty average movie, whose attempts to be graphic and shocking must be respected."

","Salo or 120 days of Sodom was a movie like nothing you could have ever seen.. Its the most disturbing movie with the least amount of blood.. Coming to the story.Its about the torture of some innocent youth by four fascist libertines,which is a direct and an extremely graphic adaptation of the novel of the same name by Marquis De Sade. Pier Pasolini made a very powerful and a daring point in this movie about the true nature of violence in all of us. It was a social and historical satire and in a vague sense, a study of humans.<br/><br/>Pasolini,in this way,points his finger at all the human beings.. But was it what Pasolini exactly portrayed..? That basic point of violence was covered and hidden beneath a lot of sleazy sexual assaults with unspeakable and despicable acts of torture..

","I believe the ""point"" of this film to be the exposure (and perhaps the overexposure) of the possibility of evil--in this case, complete debauchery--to become fully realized in a totalitarian regime. Totalitarianism opens a window through which the ruler's evil may be manifested.<br/><br/>In this film, this thought is thoroughly exposed in mostly a sexually perverse fashion: older, mostly male weirdos defiling young, innocent captives.<br/><br/>Salò underlines this matter extensively, to the point where it could potentially anger, even mortify the audience. At some point, from purely a critical perspective, the film seems to portray gross scenes and taboo imagery simply for its own sake. The film certainly intends to offend its audience and in that respect it succeeds; but I do not mean this to intend that the film is a success.<br/><br/>The film haunts the spectator after viewing to be sure--and it may be argued that that in itself is a positive effect or some form of artistic success.

"TheeDarkKnight","7","0","1","31 May 2010"," down to earth and down right realistic
","First off, Salo or the 120 days of Sodom is not a horror movie. When I first watched this movie when I was in grade 8, I was extremely interested in the controversy surrounding the film. It was widely spread as the most ""horrifying film of all time"" or ""the most disturbing film ever made."" Having said this, if you only want to watch this film because you are curious about all the commotion, don't watch it. Salo is a drama and should be watched in the right sense. It is about the abuse of power by fascist libertines, and if not watched correctly, it will not have its underlining messages learnt by the viewer.<br/><br/>This movie, in my opinion, is completely as down to earth as it gets. Dealing with such topics as the abuse of power and the evils that can be released by a single human being, Salo gives you a wake up call that is nearly unforgettable. The scenes depicted in this film will not only unsettle you, but stick with you. There is a scene where a girl is forcibly stripped naked for crying about her dead mother who drowned trying to save her. Now, the topic in this part of the scene is mainly about eating sh!t, so, the man in charge walks to the middle of the room and takes a dump on the floor, than orders the young girl to eat it. She cries while eating the feces. The obscenity of this scene does not stick with you, but the fact that a single person who has absolute power would make this crying young girl do that does. It also makes you think that this kind of stuff happens on a daily basis, and that is truly disturbing. Whether it is rape or just having a gun, Salo makes you realize the dark truth that the abuse of power is indeed a common and horrifying one. Although there are many other messages this movie conveys, they are basically ones you have to find yourself.<br/><br/>This movie is a work of art. It is incredibly realistic and shot in a way that will give you chills. The acting will leave you believing that what is on film has actually happened. The atmosphere is creepy and harrowing. The dialogue is written perfectly for each scene. They don't go over board when talking about disturbing topics, but leave it at such subtlety that is not to light but not to disgusting. Pasolini has truly captured what IS happening on earth on film.<br/><br/>Now down to what makes SO many people interested in this film, the curiosity factor of ""how disturbing is it?"" Well like I said above, don't watch this film just for the answer to that question. When I was in grade 8 that is exactly what I did, and I was unsatisfied, mainly because I thought it was incredibly boring and slow. You see so much rape and over the top gore in movies these days that that is the only reason why some people watch horror movies. If that is your case, to be disturbed, don't watch it, only because it has very little blood and guts, yet it has many scenes of sexual abuse, mental abuse,and physical abuse (the physical mainly at the end) but these are all in a different sense. Almost all of the scenes depicting the abuse are incredibly realistic, and that is exactly what Pasolini wanted, to show just how real it is. Pasolini wanted this film to be as shocking and horrific as it is only so you can realize the abuse of power and what comes with it, not so you can be disturbed. So if you watch this movie only to be disturbed, make sure you remember that, and make sure to remember that this is a serious dramatic piece that has a message, not some trashy film that wanted to push the boundaries of cinema. So to answer your question, this film will be disturbing to some, but not to all.<br/><br/>I would only recommend this film to certain people, not to all. It is not like AVATAR where you can run off to just about anyone and scream ""watch this its amazing!"" This film is undoubtedly amazing but is also undoubtedly not for everyones eyes."

","""Salo: 120 Days of Sodom"" is quite simply the bleakest and most despairing vision of humanity you can can ever hope to see. A true 'horror film,' as it genuinely horrifies, without offering any pleasure one would expect from watching a film. For ""Salo"" does not entertain, as it was not the intention of it's creator, the multi-talented genius Pier Paolo Pasolini. The film literally bleeds with a feeling of disgust and fury for the human condition. Old, jaded humans, so separated from their own humanity, can only feel satisfaction from taking from the innocent and beautiful young people, what had been taken from them by a cruel and corrupt world. 18 beautiful and virginal teens, locked away in an ornate palace by the Italian fascist regime, these four powerful men go to unimaginable lengths to corrupt the children. Inevitably, they fail to do so, and that fact is the only thing about the film that possesses a sliver of hope. Interestingly, the guards that are employed to watch over the enslaved children, are just around the same age as the teens. The guards are chosen it seems, because of the size of their penises. While they become completely, and hopelessly depraved and jaded to the horrors that they witness, the slave children never stop being horrified, terrified and sickened at the barbarity unfolding around them. If it was the intention to show what power does to the human soul, then this film succeeds in every regard. Many have seeked out this film hoping/expecting some prurient kick out of seeing the things described so many times. Only the most jaded of viewers will come away with that experience. i don't believe that ""Salo"" was created to shock, and it most certainly was not made to titillate. For anyone who has any regard for humanity will only feel extremely saddened and depressed by witnessing it. ""Salo"" holds nothing back, and the fact that the most cruel and vile punishments seem to be reserved for the most beautiful and sheltered children, make it even more grueling. Technically speaking, this might be Pasolini's most polished and professional-looking film. Apparently the young actors were not told anything about the actual subject matter, which is believable, as everyone involved seems genuinely uncomfortable, and mostly horrified with what they are involved with. At the time, to work with the most important director in Italy, was quite an opportunity and an honor, and the faith and trust that the actors put into this man, is something to behold. And as ugly as an experience as it is to sit through ""Salo,"" there are admittedly moments of exquisite beauty to behold. And the few scenes where the children comfort and try to shelter each other, gives us all hope that innocence, as well as evil, can never be totally destroyed. So for those looking for some erotic or bloody entertainment, they would do better to look elsewhere. But for those who are mature enough, and prepared to be profoundly moved, and saddened, give this a look."

I do however think this film is important & by all mean it should have been made. Yes there are the few who will see it as just some form of torture porn... some may even get off on it if certain circling internet videos are to be believed... but I am interested in the opinions of those who view Salo the way I do. Torture, slavery & sexual degradation have been happening for thousands and thousands of years & continues to happen to this day (rape, child pornography, human trafficking etc.) and I believe that in order to fully understand things of this nature (and perhaps one day getting round the stopping them when certain governments pull their finger out) films like this are necessary. It not only shows you the vile truth of sex slavery but shows the extent to which people seem to get into their acting: it must have been extremely difficult for the actors to perform in some of the scenes (those who have seen the film will know all too well what I'm talking about). In some cases, it takes the point to be thrust full force & uncensored into someone's face for them to get it but if that was the whole point of the film I can only say mission accomplished. Back to the earlier point I personally wouldn't call it an art film but I do believe it is a film that should be seen.<br/><br/>PS - To those who are fully traumatized by this film: I own the book.

I don't believe this first half of the movie is necessary but I don't know what was going on in the director's mind. Then in the later half of the movie you see the unrelenting and unsympathetic cruelty these people do to these children until the brutal end.

","Salo follows a group of fascist libertines rounding up a group of good-looking boys and girls to put through sexual, mental and physical torture. As a fan of daring films, I felt it extremely necessary to see such a film being a fan of A Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut.

The explicitness is constant and increasingly worse as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, the film made me feel queasy. However, interpreting this film is impossibly hard. On one hand, you could see it as a pointless orgy of cordless sexuality or you could see it as a representation of how power corrupts the human mind. As far as I'm concerned, I could have given this film a 1 or a 10, yet the film is so unique it is almost impossible to decipher an accurate rating. So by default, I gave it a middle rating of 5.<br/><br/>Yet, Salo is a film all film fans should see. Its bold, daring and beautifully directed.

Art is like that sometimes--it means different things to different individuals so what some might view as disgusting and sick might be totally innovative and fresh to others.

","Salo is probably at the outer limits of my understanding. I felt that I really didn't fully ""get it"", simply because I don't have a great deal of insight or understanding in extreme human depravity and bondage. To those that do, this film may well be very well done, but for me it seemed offensive and disgusting, though there was a strange need to see the film the whole way through. Perhaps to see how horrible it got! <br/><br/>This film seems to tread in the traditions of Marquis de Sade. His works are often described as ""philosophy-laden, and often violent, pornography."" His view was that freedom of expression should be completely unrestrained if it is in the pursuit of personal pleasure and there is an academic following and analysis of his work.<br/><br/>Because I have not read anything by him (nor do I have much of an interest), I cannot really speak intelligently about this film in terms of its artistic or cinematic value. Yes, there is a sexual depravity, teenage nudity, sexual torture and some rather harrowing and sickening scenes involving excrement eating. But somehow, I feel that the film wasn't showing these acts for the sake of it or because the film makers simply wanted to be ""outrageous and different."" There was an underlying... ""something"" that was elusive to me. <br/><br/>I think that if I showed this film to a crowd of average joes, they would probably think that it's nothing more than a deprave load of trash (if they were able to sit through it the whole way!). But if I showed it to an academic with a broad mind and knowledge of the philosophy of writers such as de Sade, then they may view Salo as a rather remarkable film. <br/><br/>So all I could really say is this. If you have an interest in sexual depravity and human bondage (and not the type of bondage that most of you are thinking of) then this film is for you. If you are wanting to gross yourself, irrespective of the story, this film is also for you. but even if you have an 'open mind' when it comes to film, I'd still suggest that you pass on this one. You really do need a strong stomach and I think that even adventurous film-goers who can sit through anything, would probably consider walking out (or turning off the TV) at several points during this film."

Being unfamiliar with De Sade's work - only having seen two other films about De Sade's life (Quills, Marat/Sade) I can't really say if this was transfered well or what.

"~PL~","Null","0","5","2 April 2003"," Very uncommon approach to criticize fascism
","Pier Paolo Pasolini is a man that I consider as a fascinating director. ""Salò: The 120 Days of Sodom"" (Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma) was his last film.  His most noticeable works include ""Porcile"" and ""The Gospel According To St.Matthew.  Well, I would like to be clearer on this point, and I'll say that the word ""noticeable"" here is a synonym of ""best"".  On the other hand, though, I would say that Salò is truly his most talked-about film, if you thought I meant that by noticed.  The film is good, but I really preferred the two mentionned above, artistically and intellectually speaking.  But Salò has its qualities, even though some of us might consider them as flaws.<br/><br/>Salò is based on the Marquis de Sade's novel, entitled ""Les 120 journees de Sodome"".  The book (of course, it was written way before the fascist period in Italy!) doesn't talk about fascism, and the main common point between the film and the book is the main concept.  The film shows the horrors inflicted to a bunch of young and beautiful people that were selected by four sadistic (what a funny use of the word!) fascists that are only willing to quench their own brutal sexual and violent thirsts.  They are taken to a villa where the are submitted to the worst humiliations, which include being raped whenever the four masters feel the desire to have sex, eating feces, and later on being brutally tortured and killed.<br/><br/>
This film is recognized for being one of the sickest of all times, one of the most disgusting also.  Well, the ""shocking content"" mostly consists of constant nudity of young adults, many rapes, excrement-eating, scalping, tongue mutilation, and eye gouging.  There are also pretty nasty stories told by a lady whose role in the villa is to tell sick stories that have for goal to turn on the four masters.  I saw movies that were more disgusting than that, sincerely.  The context and the cruelty surrounding many acts of violence and humiliation in this film are probably the main reason why it shocked so many people.  The sexuality is never explicit (in the way that you never see a penetration graphically), the killings are pretty well done (the scalping especially) but there are very few of them and they are brief. I would say that ""Caligula"" is way more graphic and shocking than ""Salò"" (but less effective though).<br/><br/>Pasolini's directing is beautiful.  He made a mistake in one scene, changing the angle of the camera of less than 30 degrees between two shots. Except for that, he's fascinating...he's obsessed with showing symmetrical images...all the time.  This technique somehow communicates the ""discipline"" and the supposedly high ""straightness"" of the fascists pretended to have. Also, the camera often has a pretty wide vision, and we don't often really get close to any character.  With such coldness, Pasolini was criticized a lot.  People didn't know if it was really a statement against fascism or just a good reason to show horrible things...Personnally, knowing a couple of things about Pasolini's life, I didn't doubt one moment about his intentions.  Yes, he had socialist tendencies, yes, he was a homosexual (which fascists hated) and yes, he was against fascism, and it is clear when you see the film.  People who only watch American films and are used to explicit messages in films will not understand that, but this film plundges us into cruelty we could have really compared to the nazis', and that's how it delivers its message.  Maybe too subtle for some, but sometimes, I think it's better this way...just like in most American movies...an example: American History X talks about racism...""Racism is bad"" is almost written on the walls...it's very sanctimonious, it's really not subtle...but there are movies where they only show horrible things the way they really are, without really giving a judgement in an explicit way...I think it even works better. I am a bit tired of moralizers, to be honest.<br/><br/>The acting is very good.  Also, I got the French Limited DVD of this film...that's the best edition, trust me!  The audio tracks are in french (which Pasolini considered should have been the original language of this film, because it was the Marquis de Sade's and also the original Italian track.  The one in french is amazing, really.  There are also lots of extras, this is really a must-have.  The actors, especially the four fascists, are extremely cold and creepy...Pasolini did a good job directing them.<br/><br/>Overall, the film takes a very neutral approach to the horrors it displays, but that's effective.  Sure, this is not a perfect movie, it has pretty slow moments and it is not that well structured, but it achieves its goal, which is to make a statement against fascism.<br/><br/>8/10"

Have they become desensitised to the violence? Or are they trying to connect to their old identities before they were captured?<br/><br/>I also found it odd, that while the teenagers were put through such degrading experiences - such as having to eat sh*t, being publicly buggered etc, a number of their captors got involved, having the same things done to them, and clearly enjoying it.<br/><br/>Finally, while a lot of the content of the film was unpleasant - pornographic and scatalogical images can now be obtained on the internet.

","I was hardly surprised by the tirades of abuse heaped on this film by so many commentators.  The forcible eating of human excrement and the spectacle of depraved middle-aged men sodomising young people in full view of others are high on most people's taboos.  I could not help reflecting however what a funny old world this is as I emerged reeling from a cinema the other day having just been battered senseless by nearly three hours of violence in Martin Scorsese's ""Gangs of New York.  You won't find all the ""Disgusteds of Tunbridge Wells"" flocking to user comments on the IMDb to record their protests at this marathon chunk of limb chopping, burning and impaling. It's all a matter of ""what's your poison?"" I suppose and when you come down to it mutilation of the flesh seems generally more acceptable than buggery and s*** eating.  Not that ""Salo"" does not have it all.  There are some pretty hideous tortures at the end but many will have walked out by then whereas the audience for Scorsese remained rooted to the end.  Although I would not take either film to my desert island, I have little hesitation in giving Pasolini my preference.  It is a very powerful parable about the nature of depravity and evil.  Had the orgies been toned down as Fellini was sometime wont to do in ""La Dolce Vita"" and ""Satyricon"", the powerful anti-Fascist message would have lost its ferocious force.  ""Salo"" is undoubtedly an uncomfortable experience, but in no way gratuitously obscene as so many have implied."

You can remember the president yelled one of the female victims in anger, ""what's your name!"", but she couldn't answer only one word, even her own name, because she was nothing in that house in which we can see the metaphor for our society. To have one's own name is the first self-assertion.

And you can see her in other two or three scenes, for instance, she was rubbed her buttocks by the president on his knees , or, she appeared again when the fascists check the victim's bedpans, however, she did not appear in the fascists and the guard's marriage ceremony, and also in the dog-style super and in the last selection with blue ribbon, I cannot recognise her, but....

Many critics write about the terror of the new capitalism or something though, I need some new points of view, in which you can consider sadism in relation to PPP's sexuality, or in which you can recognize his gimmicks in this film to find his other intentions that are still hidden, not lost, in PPP's eternal silence."

The beauty and reckless of youth is perfectly depicted in this masterpiece. Basically Salo is about a couple dozen teenagers going to a quasi-resort ""more like a paradise"" and embarking on a spiritual journey through a land never before seen.

","I hear a lot of complaints about this little film and I'm wondering ""what's the fuss? This is the way art works."" Pier Paolo Pasolini was previously known as a writer who finally he got his big break doing film scenarios for Fellini. Thenceforth as a director himself, Pasolini created many films, mostly based on famous literature (i.e., Decameron, Medea, Arabian Nights, etc.) One day Pasolini decided on adapting de Sade's ""120 days of Sodom"" to the big screen. Little did he know what fuss it would cause. Salo is a film depicting Fascist Italy and it's malefactions while keeping a group of children hostage. The film follows the fascist revelry in the abuse, rape and murder of the children; thus the film is set as an allegory for the decadence and depravity of humanity. Sounds like a great film . . . well, truly it is. Although a controversy at the time (for which Pasolini was murdered for) Salo seems tame today compared to films like Natural Born Killers, Crash, and Saving Private Ryan. Nevertheless, what people seem to not understand is how to appreciate Salo as a work of art that it is. Liken to most controversial art forms (notably Dada and ""surprisingly"" things done by Andy Warhol) Salo was created to instill a reaction in its viewers. Be it the famous ""Circle of Sh*t"" which had me gagging on the floor, or ""Circle of Blood"" which made me feel uneasy and somewhat angry. However, that is the way art works, it is geared to provoke and/or imbue emotions. Andy Warhol had people yawning, L'age D'or had people protesting, and Salo found deep-seated hatred by most of it's viewers; again, these artists all succeeded in making there point. It is sad to say that Pasolini was murdered for this film; if only he lived what other masterpieces would he create. For those who are interested in Pasolini, check out ""Whoever Says the Truth Shall Die"" one of the better documentaries of the artist himself."

But the fact is that, when the Italian Fab Four aren't doing anything nasty, this meandering film is just boring. That's a strong sign of weak filmmaking. Or do you also want to fool yourself by thinking that Pasolini wanted the film to be boring (to catch the audience offguard with yet another outburst of nastiness --that's nonsense 'cause the film is actually quite predictable: the madam tells the kids a story, and the four mentally ill chums carry it out. Next scene same thing.)?<br/><br/>Salo has no story-line, it's just a collection of perverted fantasies carried out by four sickening individuals. Of course we despise these creeps, but unfortunately, we don't feel sympathy for the victims either, as they seem, for the most part, actually quite willing to undergo AND carry out horrific actions.<br/><br/>Leave out the 'shocking material' and you have nothing, or as Trainspotting's Mark Renton would have said: ""A piece of sh*te"". Extremities are easy, whether 'cute' or 'sadistic'. So is hiding behind literal references or political messages (so this is an anti-fascist film? Yeah, sure, and ""Last House On the Left"" is based on Bergman's ""The Virgin Spring""). Real talented filmmakers don't need any of this. So if you're really interested in the dark side of human psyche and/or gradual psychological disintegration that really pulls you in, watch ""Blue Velvet"", the first 30 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Blair Witch Project"", ""Ordinary People"", or read Donna Tartt's ""The Secret History"".<br/><br/>This isn't an important piece of cinema. It just illustrates that certain people want to be different and embrace a piece of c**p just because everybody else hates it. Guess what? Such behavior makes those people just as predictable and it labels them just as much.<br/><br/>0 out of ****"
